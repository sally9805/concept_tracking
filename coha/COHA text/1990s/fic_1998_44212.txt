Translator 's Introduction Born in Okinawa , Japan 's southernmost prefecture , Medoruma Shun currently teaches Japanese at a vocational high school on Miyako Island , far removed from Tokyo 's literary world . ( The author 's name is given in Japanese order , with surname first . Although he has been winning literary awards in Okinawa since his university days , Medoruma was largely unknown among mainland Japanese readers until Droplets ( Suiteki ) was awarded the Akutagawa Prize in the summer of 1997 . The Akutagawa Prize is Japan 's most prestigious award for fiction , and Medoruma was the second writer from Okinawa to receive the award in two years-a fact critics deemed noteworthy since Okinawans represent only one percent of Japan 's population and have maintained a distinct ethnic identity within this nation that takes pride in its so-called homogeneity . <p> Several of the characters in Droplets speak in an Okinawan dialect that would be incomprehensible to mainland Japanese readers without the accompanying glosses , which Medoruma unobtrusively incorporates into the text . Since the dialect is a salient part of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the original by rendering those dialogues into a non-standard English , loosely based on the speech patterns of Appalachia . Readers should bear in mind , however , that the Okinawan landscape resembles that of Hawaii more than it does Appalachia or even mainland Japan . Surrounded by coral reefs and covered with lush green foliage and brilliant flowers , the Ryukyu Islands appear exotic to most Japanese . Yet Droplets centers on a more humble image from Okinawa 's landscape-the gourd melon . Roughly the size and shape of a watermelon , the gourd melon is usually boiled and eaten as a vegetable . Shortly after the Battle of Okinawa , abnormally large vegetables began to appear , presumably nourished by the countless corpses absorbed into the soil . <p> MICHAEL MOLASKY <p> It was during a dry spell in mid-June , the rainy season , when Tokusho 's leg suddenly swelled up . He lay napping on a steel-framed army cot in the back room , away from the scorching sun of the cloudless sky . The heat had subsided now that it was past five o'clock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a feverish sensation in his right leg . He looked down to see that the lower half of his leg had swelled up bigger than his thigh . Frightened , he tried to sit up , but his body would n't move , nor could he speak . Cold sweat trickled down his neck . At first Tokusho thought he 'd had a stroke , yet he felt alert and clear-headed . As he stared at the ceiling wondering what to do , his leg swelled up even bigger , stretching his skin so tight that it became smooth and shiny . Then his leg started to itch as if an army of ants were crawling across it , and although he was desperate to scratch , he could n't move a muscle . For nearly half an hour he just lay there , cursing until his wife Ushi came in to wake him . The sun 's rays were gentler now , and Ushi wanted him to go back to the fields with her . <p> Tokusho 's leg had already swelled to the size of an average gourd melon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a family of poisonous habu , the mother snake lying beside her offspring , spread out like a fan . The sparse hair on his leg made it look lewd . " Grandpa , time to git yourself up . C'm on now . " When Ushi shook his shoulder , Tokusho 's head slid off the pillow and tears dripped from his eyes , wide open and glazed , while saliva drooled from his mouth . " Hurry up ; Outta ' that bed , ya ' hear ? " <p> Tokusho often feigned sleep to avoid work , so Ushi-thinking he was up to his usual tricks-grabbed him by the nose and pulled it so hard she might have been trying to tear it right off his face . Still , he showed no reaction . Sensing something wrong , Ushi looked him over and discovered what appeared to be a gourd melon left by a neighbor . Then she realized that it was Tokusho 's right leg . <p> " Well , I 'll be . . . What on earth happened to this leg ? " Timidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt slightly feverish but firm . Then Ushi got angry when she remembered that she 'd have no one to help weed the fields or cut the grass to feed their goats . " Damn ! How come the lazy bum got ta go out and get some weird ailment durin ' the busy season ! " Ushi decided that the illness was a result of Tokusho 's carefree lifestyle-the late nights spent singing and playing the sanshin , gambling and carousing with women-and she slapped his swollen shin with all her might . Tokusho 's eyes rolled back into his head and he lost consciousness . The slap resounded pleasantly as the tip of Tokusho 's big toe split open , spewing forth water . Ushi hurriedly moved his leg off the bed and put a pitcher on the floor to catch the liquid dripping from his heel . The liquid , which seemed to be nothing more than water , had stopped gushing , but continued to drip steadily . <p> " Mighty strange , " thought Ushi , staring at the droplets of water that oozed forth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Curious , she moistened her fingertip with the liquid and took a taste . It had the mild sweetness of the juice from an unripe hechima gourd . Ushi thought this odd since other bodily liquids such as blood , sweat , and urine were pungent , so she slipped on her rubber sandals and went off to call the doctor . <p> The following morning rumors about Tokusho 's leg spread through the village . Curiosity-seekers feigning concern formed a line outside the house , and by noon it was nearly fifty meters long . There had n't been such a long line in the village since the American troops started passing out food rations after the war , and even those with little interest in the ruckus felt compelled to queue up . At first Ushi served tea and sweets to the visitors , thanking them for their concern , but she finally lost her temper when an ice cream peddler showed up at the scene . <p> " What do you think this is ? Some kind of freak show ? " she shouted . Then she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waving it around as she admonished the crowd . " Bunch of lazy good  --  for-nothin 's ! " The villagers knew how much Ushi relied on Tokusho ; anyone who dared talk back risked serious injury , so they quickly dispersed . <p> After Ushi disappeared into the house , the crowd began to regroup in shady spots throughout the village-beneath the gajimaru tree in front of the farmers ' co-op , under the eaves of the community center , on the benches shaded by the long branches of the kuwadisaa tree near the gateball field . Those who had actually seen Tokusho 's leg dominated the conversations , describing its shape and smell , its luster and consistency , the disfiguration of the toenails . Some villagers recounted earlier examples of swollen extremities and speculated about whether this was a good or bad omen ; others began placing bets on when the swelling would subside . <p> By the time they started to debate the impact of Tokusho 's leg on the village economy , evening had rolled around and the liquor was flowing freely . Before long they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and karate performances began , prompting a candidate in the upcoming village council election to go out and slaughter a goat , which he offered as the evening 's feast . Meanwhile , the man rumored to be his principal opponent sent his son off to buy liquor for the occasion . Unsold mangos and pineapples were peeled , their sweet fragrance mixing with the smell of canned mackerel and dried squid . Women surrounded the pot of goat stew , their faces glowing from the heat ; children set off firecrackers ; the young adults drifted down to the beach , where their bodies were soon overlapping and moving in unison with the waves ; dogs ran wild through the village with pig bones clutched between their jaws . <p> " Fools ! Jis ' do n't appreciate a person 's worries . " Ushi stood at the window and shook her fist at the revelers in the distance . She then returned to Tokusho 's bedside to change the ice on his leg . " How come this got ta ' happen to us ? " she thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed to participate in the village religious rites and always looked after her family 's ancestral altar . <p> Tokusho had only a slight fever and his pulse was normal . He was snoring lightly and seemed to be sound asleep . His right leg was now the size of a large gourd melon . Ushi was tempted to take a razor blade and puncture the leg , but even she , known to be fearless , panicked at the thought that Tokusho might never regain consciousness . A droplet of water continued to ooze from his big toe at the rate of once every few seconds . Ushi placed a new bucket under his bed and emptied the water from the old one into the garden behind the house . <p> Oshiro , the doctor at the local clinic , was a good-natured man in his mid-thirties . His gentle manner made him popular with the elderly villagers . After checking Tokusho 's blood pressure , taking blood samples , and conducting an external exam , Oshiro made no effort to hide his perplexity . The doctor was unable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a university hospital in the city where he could undergo a thorough examination , but Ushi instantly rejected the idea . " No sir ! Not a chance ! " she shouted , remembering how old villagers from the gateball field always said that " no one leaves them university hospitals alive . " Unable to persuade Ushi to follow his advice , Oshiro took out a small bottle and collected a sample of the water dripping from Tokusho 's heel . As he put the bottle in his bag , the doctor once again urged Ushi to take Tokusho for a complete examination the following day and promised to check on him regularly . <p> Ushi and Tokusho had no children . They had lived together for forty years farming a small plot of land , and neither ever considered life without the other . Striving to convince herself that Tokusho was not in mortal danger , Ushi decided to care for him at home , and she went out to the shed for the machete to scare off the noisy villagers . <p> Starting the next morning , Oshiro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nurse would come to replace the I. v. and to help change Tokusho 's clothes . This gave Ushi a few minutes to go out and check on the fields . Four days after Tokusho 's leg first swelled up , Oshiro stopped by and announced that the test results were in . The doctor explained that he had asked a friend at a university hospital to analyze the liquid from Tokusho 's leg . Ushi had served the doctor her homemade daikon pickled in brown sugar , and he sat on the veranda munching away while pointing to a sheet of paper lined with tiny numbers . " Basically , it 's just water , although it appears to contain a slightly higher level of lime , " he reported . <p> Ushi asked why the water was dripping from Tokusho 's leg . " Yes , that 's the mystery , " the doctor replied with a friendly smile . Ushi was tempted to ask how he could call himself a doctor if he could n't even tell her what was wrong , but restrained herself . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurry and stop that dripping ? " she pleaded instead . Oshiro simply repeated that this is why Tokusho must be admitted to the university hospital . " That wo n't do shit , " Ushi muttered under her breath , remembering a rumor that university hospitals use their old patients as guinea pigs . Someone had mentioned this when the Village Senior Citizens Association took a bus tour of the island 's war memorials . " Huh ? " asked the doctor , but Ushi merely laughed and thanked him , deciding once and for all that the only option was to cure Tokusho by herself . <p> At first Ushi thought that Tokusho had caught parasites . When she was a child , there were several men in the village who walked with a limp , dragging behind them a bad leg that resembled the stump of a pine tree . Hanging out from their loincloth would be a testicle the size of a boar 's . Especially famous was the Wheelbarrow Man , a traveling repairman who made rounds of the local villages . His enormous testicle was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pumpkin . The village children delighted in watching him work , for he found countless ways to deploy this special tool . It served him as a worktable when he repaired pots and pans , he used it to fix umbrellas , and even to sharpen knives . When he finished work the man would load his testicle into the wheelbarrow with his other tools and move on to the next village . Ushi 's eyes filled with tears of nostalgia as she remembered the sight of the Wheelbarrow Man leaving the village , his ragged kimono torn in back and his tiny figure retreating into the distance . Then it suddenly occurred to her that Tokusho 's swelling might have reached his testicles , but she was relieved to find her fears unwarranted . <p> Tokusho 's legs had never been especially hairy . Now that the hair on his swollen shin had fallen out , the leg was covered only with baby fluff . The greenish color had deepened , and if it were n't for the snakehead toes , Tokusho 's leg would have been indistinguishable from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regularity . <p> One day some of Oshiro 's physician friends stopped by to examine the water , but Ushi did n't even let them through the door . Still , Oshiro continued to visit regularly and gave no sign of having been offended . Ushi never mentioned the incident but did give the doctor a generous serving of her pickled daikon . Tokusho 's pulse and temperature remained normal , and he continued to sleep well , snoring lightly during his afternoon naps , so Ushi began to spend more time in the fields . At night she placed a large bucket under Tokusho 's foot and returned to her own room to sleep , as she had in the past . Then the soldiers began to appear at Tokusho 's bedside . Tokusho had been alert and clear-headed ever since the day he was confined to bed . Even when he seemed to be sleeping , he could hear what was going on around him and could understand Ushi 's conversations with Oshiro . Yet he was unable to speak and could n't even use gestures or eye movements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the thought that , in addition to being paralyzed , he might be growing senile . As an inveterate optimist , however , he convinced himself that he would soon be cured , and instead of worrying he killed time composing imaginary letters of apology to the women who he supposed by now must be feeling neglected . Ushi left the room , and Tokusho was just nodding off when he was awakened by an itchy and vaguely painful sensation in the big toe of his right foot . His eyelids opened and he was able to crane his neck forward . The room was filled with the glare of the fluorescent light , which had been left on . <p> " Hey , " Tokusho managed to cry in a hoarse voice . " Ushi ! Ushi ! " he called , but his voice did n't reach the next room . Even so , Tokusho was ecstatic that he could move at all , and he turned his head , eyes panning the room , until he noticed several men lined up at the foot of his bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they had been drenched in muddy water . Each of them stared at Tokusho 's foot , seemingly lost in thought . Tokusho again craned his neck forward and discovered another man , hair parted in the middle and head wrapped in a discolored bandage . The man was crouched down on the floor , his hands grasping the swollen ankle so that the water from Tokusho 's heel dripped into his mouth . The man swallowed loudly , and the throats of the soldiers standing behind him contracted as they watched with envy . <p> There were five men in all . Of the four who were standing , two wore helmets and two had bandages wrapped around their shaven heads . The bandages had turned a brownish color . The man standing in front had a splint on his right arm , and the second man balanced on crutches , his right leg cut off at the knee . The third soldier seemed to be a mere boy of fourteen or fifteen . The right half of his face was swollen and bruised , and three large gashes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purplish blood adhered to the wound like tiny mulberries . The fourth soldier was a handsome man with the facial features of a mainland Japanese . At first glance he seemed to have no wounds whatsoever , but a closer look revealed that more than half of his neck had been severed from behind . <p> The man who was crouching down put his mouth on Tokusho 's heel and began licking . Horror , combined with the unbearable tickling sensation , made Tokusho cringe . Feeling as if he was about to lose his mind , he silently began reciting the lyrics to the village harvest dance . After a while the soldier who had been drinking stood up . Without a moment 's hesitation , the next man in line crouched down and started drinking . The soldier who had just finished paused and looked longingly down at Tokusho 's foot , but he soon stood at attention , saluted Tokusho , and bowed . Slowly , he then turned away and vanished through the wall on Tokusho 's right . At nearly the same time , from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the line . The new soldier seemed to be over forty . He looked around the room as if beholding some rare spectacle . When his eyes met Tokusho 's , the man 's bearded face broke into a smile and he bowed slightly . Tokusho had a vague recollection of the man but could n't remember where he had first seen him . <p> The boy with the bandage around his head groaned as he brushed his hand over the wound on his chest . Huge maggots fell to the floor one after another . The animated , ivory-colored maggots instantly began crawling toward the bed . A hoarse cry escaped from Tokusho 's throat . After creeping forward about twelve inches , the maggots turned into dark blotches and vanished . <p> It was not long before the second soldier finished drinking , saluted , bowed deeply , and disappeared into the wall to the right . Just as before , a new soldier appeared out of the opposite wall and took his place in line . This continued until dawn . <p> The soldiers were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they might harm him . Each man was so seriously wounded that he could barely remain standing . Tokusho was moved to pity by their miserable condition and polite bows as they disappeared , one after another , into the wall . Among them were men so pathetic that Tokusho was forced to avert his eyes . One soldier , about twenty years old , had his flesh torn away from his throat down to his collarbone , and with each breath , countless bubbles of blood floated out from his lungs . Yet even soldiers in such a condition would drink desperately . <p> Tokusho looked at the clock on the wall . Each soldier took an average of two minutes . The water , which dripped slowly , could not seem to quench the men 's thirst . Often they were rushed along by the next man in line , and when their turn was up , they would look longingly at Tokusho 's foot . If the dripping slowed , some men would lick the sole of his foot ; some even took his big toe into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At first Tokusho found the tickling sensation unbearable , but he eventually got used to it and would drop off into a light slumber . <p> It was not until five A. M. that the soldiers stopped appearing out of one wall and disappearing into another . As streaks of blue brushed the dawn sky , the last man finished drinking and , leaning unsteadily on his cane , disappeared through the wall . Tokusho slowly shook his groggy head and looked at his leg . The swelling had noticeably subsided , as had the dripping . He was ecstatic and would have shouted for joy , but was too sleepy to utter a word . He then mustered all his strength and tried to sit up , but a searing pain shot through his foot from his toes to his groin . Water poured out from the tip of his big toe and Tokusho , his mouth still open , lost consciousness . <p> The swelling that seemed to have subsided returned by noon the following day . <p> Ushi had tried every possible cure . She visited the female @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the extract from a brew of worms and paddy fish . When she heard that a butterfly on the brink of death had been rejuvenated after imbibing the water from fuba grass , she gathered some of the seaweed from the rocky shore and made Tokusho swallow the extract . After hearing that the meat of a sea turtle would surely cure Tokusho 's ailment , Ushi procured the rare meat . She applied cold packs made of aloe and tried acupuncture and moxibustion . She even tried bleeding the leg . She was afraid that blood or water would shoot out once she pierced the smooth skin of Tokusho 's bloated leg , but when she gently applied the razor , only tiny beads of blood oozed forth . Ushi collected the blood in a cup and studied it . She was relieved to find that the color and consistency seemed perfectly normal , and there were no apparent impurities . Still , there was no sign that Tokusho 's condition was improving . <p> At the urging of the old women of the village , Ushi called on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miserable . Besides charging an outrageous fee , the shaman scolded Ushi for neglecting her ancestral spirits , and she ended up ashamed of herself for relying on a shaman in the first place . <p> " Poor Tokusho . I just ca n't seem to cure you , " muttered Ushi , gently rubbing his leg . Hearing her words , Tokusho was overcome with emotion . <p> Now the soldiers began to appear nightly . Around midnight , Ushi would change the bucket and return to her room . Then they would emerge , one after another , from the wall to Tokusho 's left . During this time Tokusho was able to move his head and eyes freely . The soldiers rarely looked at him except when they saluted before and after drinking . Their wounds were so severe they could barely remain standing , and their eyes were always fixed on Tokusho 's big toe . <p> Tokusho noted that the soldiers were members of the Japanese forces . All had suffered serious injuries , and roughly eighty percent seemed to be from mainland Japan . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ island 's Defense Force were men so old their hair had turned gray . The soldiers rarely spoke to one another . They simply stood in line , silently awaiting their turn . Those unable to stand were supported by the others . After a while Tokusho could no longer bear to look at them and closed his eyes , praying for sleep . <p> It happened on the third night after the soldiers first appeared . Toward dawn Tokusho awoke from a light nap and gazed groggily as a soldier disappeared into the wall to his right . When the next soldier emerged , his eyes downcast , Tokusho suddenly groaned , " Ishimine ! " Tokusho and Ishimine were the only students from their cluster of villages who had gone on to the teacher 's higher school in Shuri after graduation . They had both been recruited into the Blood and Iron Imperial Workers Corps and had stayed together throughout the battle . Now Ishimine stood before Tokusho , exactly as he had when they parted . Wrapped around his stomach in place of a bandage was one cloth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been Tokusho 's , and he had used it to bind Ishimine 's wound . It was Tokusho who had made the splint from a pine branch that supported Ishimine 's crushed ankle . As Tokusho stared at Ishimine 's downcast eyes and delicate profile he was at a loss for words . <p> Although Tokusho and Ishimine were from the same group of villages , they had n't met until entering the teacher 's higher school . Yet after less than half a year in the corps , they were sharing their innermost thoughts , relying on jokes to disguise their growing intimacy . Ishimine rarely spoke and always had his nose in books , so it was Tokusho who did most of the talking . But Ishimine 's replies were succinct and insightful , and while Tokusho tried to appear nonchalant , he would listen intently to his friend 's remarks . <p> When the Battle of Okinawa began , Tokusho and Ishimine were placed in the same company of the Blood and Iron Imperial Workers Corps , where they were assigned to messenger duty and munitions transport . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and worked their way south . Tokusho 's company ended up facing them on the front line , and after the second firefight , had been all but annihilated . Tokusho and Ishimine fled south with a small group of Yamatonchu ( mainland Japanese ) soldiers , making their way from cave to cave . Then on the night that Ishimine was hit in the stomach with shrapnel from a naval bombardment , they got separated at the southern tip of the island . <p> Now the soldier who had been drinking stood up , saluted Tokusho , and disappeared . Ishimine , supporting himself on the shoulders of the man in front of him , dragged his right leg and took two steps forward . No new soldier appeared from the wall . It was nearly dawn . Gradually it became clear to Tokusho that Ishimine had recognized him , but was pretending not to . <p> These were the soldiers who had been left behind that night in the cave . <p> Now the pain returned to Tokusho 's right leg . When Ishimine 's turn came , Tokusho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ishimine kept staring at the floor . Unable to utter a word , Tokusho let his head fall back on the pillow and shut his eyes . Two cold palms grasped his swollen ankle . The thin lips parted and engulfed his big toe . When the tip of the tongue brushed across the wound on his toe , a tingling shot up from his foot through his thigh to the root that had hardened in his groin . A small moan escaped from Tokusho 's mouth , and his aging body emitted the scent of young grass . " Hey , how 're you doin ' ? Long time ! " said Seiyu , suddenly entering the room . <p> Ushi , who had been wiping Tokusho with a towel , glared at him . " What in hell 's name you doin ' here ? " she demanded . <p> Seiyu , his face flushed from liquor , responded to Ushi 's barb by forcing a smile and presenting a white plastic bag from the supermarket . " Just payin ' a visit to the invalid . Just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ushi was sure that the papayas and goyas Seiyu pulled out of the bag had been stolen . <p> " We ai n't takin ' nothin ' from you . Put that away and make yourself scarce ! " <p> The papayas he had placed on the table were overripe and had begun to rot . A moldy odor wafted through the room , and a drone beetle crawled out from one of them , splitting its orange skin . Seiyu caught the insect between his fingers and threw it out the window . It then turned a luminous green and flew off into the blue sky . <p> " Where 'd ya ' swipe it from ? " <p> " C'm on , Ushi . You know I bought it . " <p> " That 's a damn lie , " said Ushi , looking disgusted . Seiyu leaned against the window frame , smiling obsequiously . Ushi had n't seen him for nearly six months , and as he scratched his head she noticed how thin his hair had become . Surprised at how much Seiyu had aged , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided not to throw him out after all . <p> Seiyu and Tokusho were cousins . Although they were the same age , Seiyu had never married . Sometimes he would go off to mainland Japan to work , and other times he 'd find work as a day laborer in Naha . When the traditional New Year 's celebration approached in February , he would always return to the house that his parents had left to him in the village . There he would earn daily wages cutting sugar cane . Tokusho and Ushi had worried about Seiyu this year since he had n't returned for the New Year 's celebrations , but when Ushi actually set eyes on him her first reaction was disgust . Seiyu 's scrawny body and impoverished features had earned him the nickname " Rat , " although his big , strong teeth looked more like those of a horse . He wore pants with a sharp crease ( obviously U.S. military surplus ) and his gaudy T-shirt looked like those hawked to tourists at the beach . Seiyu stared at Tokusho , mesmerized at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventy , and look at you , " Ushi said to Seiyu . She had always blamed him for her husband 's obsession with drinking and gambling . <p> Seiyu approached Tokusho and was about to remove the towel covering his leg when Ushi grabbed a nearby fly swatter and slapped his outstretched arm with all her might . " Hey ! What 's that for ? " <p> " Keep them rotten hands off ! " <p> " Ushi , I 'm just worried about him ... " <p> " Your worryin ' ai n't gon na ' change nothin ' . Hands off ! " Ushi waved the fly swatter menacingly , and Seiyu fled to the opposite side of the bed . From there he had a good view of the water dripping from Tokusho 's toe , which was white and swollen . Droplets formed at a small slit in the toe , then rolled down the sole to his heel , where they fell into the bucket . <p> " Is it water ? " <p> Ushi did n't answer . Ripples spread across the colorless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Hey , what 're ya ' up to now ? " <p> Seiyu had leaned over to get a closer look when the fly swatter descended on his head . " Git the hell away from there . You 're gittin ' on my nerves ! " Ushi grumbled as she kicked him in the behind . Then with both hands , she took the bucket from under Tokusho 's foot and carried it to the window , where she paused for a moment before lifting it . Seiyu stepped forward to help but Ushi rebuked him , " Outta ' my way ! " Seiyu could do nothing but lean against the window frame and watch as the bucket was emptied into the garden behind the house . <p> The weeds in the garden had grown thick , and even hard-working Ushi could n't keep them under control . Branches jutted out every which way from the hedge of the Chinese hibiscus , its red flowers shining against the blue sky . Entwined with the hedge was a vine from some type of gourd , perhaps a hechima @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow flowers . Seiyu stood absorbed in the sight of the enormous yellow flowers until noticing that only those sections of the garden that sparkled with the water droplets from Ushi 's bucket had grown irregularly . Weeds were sparse in those areas untouched by the water , and dry sections of the hedge retained their shape as if they had recently been trimmed . Seiyu was still puzzling over the scene when a voice assailed him from behind , " Hey , if you ai n't got nothing to do , why do n't ya ' just hurry on home ? " Ushi sat in front of the fan beside the bed , glaring at Seiyu . <p> " Ushi , ya ' should n't let the weeds grow like this . " <p> Ushi glared even more menacingly , and Seiyu noticed that she was blushing . He knew how ashamed Ushi felt to have weeds growing in her garden , so he entered into negotiations delicately . " Ushi , how 's about hirin ' me to help out with the garden and fieldwork ? I 'll also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . Ya ' do n't need to pay me much , though I 'd be mighty grateful if you could fix my meals . " <p> The glare still on her face , Ushi pondered Seiyu 's offer . In fact , she had wanted someone to help out since she could n't spend enough time in the fields , nor could she keep up with the weeding . Even when it came to caring for Tokusho , she had n't been able to do everything she 'd wanted , such as turning him over regularly to prevent bedsores . The next-door neighbors had offered to help , but Ushi , not one to rely on outsiders , had turned them down . While she hated the idea of relying on Seiyu , she agreed to hire him at one thousand yen and three meals per day , adding the threat , " I 'll break every bone in your body if you slack off or try swipin ' anything from this house . " <p> Ushi gave Seiyu his instructions for the day . He was to change the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed every half  --  hour , and cut the grass . If there was a problem , he was to call her immediately . Then she got into her low-horsepower car and raced off to the fields , twice nearly hitting groups of children on their way home from school . <p> Seiyu sat near Tokusho 's pillow , scrutinizing his leg , and tried to strike up a conversation . He quickly grew bored , however , since Tokusho could n't respond . So , after turning up the volume on the radio that was tuned to the station playing Okinawan folksongs , he leaned against the wall and drifted off to sleep . After an hour or so , Seiyu awoke with a chill in his lower body . When he looked down , he thought for a moment that he had wet his pants while sleeping . Then he jumped up and hurried to change the bucket . The water from Tokusho 's big toe was dripping more rapidly and had filled the bucket , which was overflowing onto the floor . <p> " Oh my god ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouted , throwing the water out the window and then rushing back to wipe the floor . " Never saw nothin ' like this before . " <p> Seiyu gasped and stared at the water dripping from the split in Tokusho 's big toe . Not long before , the back of Seiyu 's hands had begun to itch unbearably , and now they were covered with black marks . The marks looked like tiny insects , and he had tried to brush them off but could n't get rid of them . Then he shuddered , realizing that the marks were actually growing on his hands . Like Tokusho , Seiyu had always had sparse body hair . At one time they both had tried shaving their arms and chests , hoping to make the hair grow thicker , but nothing came back in its place except the same baby fluff . Now stiff roots of dark , lustrous hair covered Seiyu 's fingers and the backs of his hands . <p> As Seiyu stared at his hands , a glint of light caught his eye . He went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had just thrown out sparkled in the sunlight , and the grass stood erect , emitting a peculiar scent . The flowers growing on the hedge shown brilliantly in reds and yellows . Seiyu rushed back to the bucket , dipped in his hands and patted some water onto his balding forehead . It took less than five minutes to take effect . His forehead began to itch as if tiny insects were crawling under the skin , and when he rubbed it , he felt the stiff roots of what seemed to be soft , thin hairs . Barely containing his excitement , he cupped his hands and scooped up some of the liquid from the bucket , yet it had no smell and seemed no different from plain water . Seiyu cupped his hands again and caught some of the water dripping from Tokusho 's heel . Timidly , he stuck out his tongue . A mild sweetness spread through his mouth ; it was less bitter than he had expected . Now he tried more , swishing it around with his tongue . Suddenly he felt a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire body felt flushed . A pleasurable throb surged through his pelvis . The front of his pants bulged . Seiyu had been impotent for the past few years . Whenever he found himself a woman , his pathetic member assumed the shape and size of a dead sparrow 's head ; now it had grown to a good-sized pigeon 's head , its long neck throbbing back and forth . <p> " Hallelujah ! " shouted Seiyu , piercing the air with three quick karate punches . Then he bounded out of the room in search of a container for the water . Tokusho awoke to the sound of laughter and to the sensation of his big toe being sucked . The soldiers were on their third round . When he realized that these were the same men he had left behind in the cave , Tokusho thought they might kill him . Yet it soon became apparent that he had nothing to fear , and he decided that relieving the soldiers ' thirst was the only way to atone for his sins . Eventually , Tokusho even began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this point he still found it utterly repulsive . <p> Starting with their third round , the soldiers began behaving differently . Whether they had regained some energy or simply grown accustomed to being in the room , they were often engrossed in conversation while awaiting their turn , and at times laughed so loudly that Tokusho thought the neighbors might overhear . Tokusho was both eager and anxious as he stared at the door expecting Ushi to wake up , but there was no sign of her . The soldiers seemed completely oblivious to Tokusho . They continued to salute him before and after drinking , and they would look down in deference when approaching his leg , but otherwise they paid him no notice whatsoever . Besides Ishimine , Tokusho had spoken to several of these soldiers in the cave , and he was not pleased that they now ignored him . <p> " What did I do to deserve this ? " Tokusho lamented dozens of times each day , yet he never sought the answer . He was afraid that once he started to think about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the past fifty years would burst out like floodwaters . Tokusho remembered the elementary school students who , accompanied by their teacher , paid him a sick call one afternoon . Over the past ten years , whenever June 23rd approached and Okinawans prepared to commemorate those killed in the war , Tokusho was called on to speak at the local elementary , middle , and high schools about his war experiences . Under normal circumstances at this time of year , Tokusho would be busy making the rounds of the local schools . The students who visited him this year were from the very first school where Tokusho had spoken ten years ago , and no matter how busy he was , he always made time to visit their school . <p> It was a teacher from the village who originally proposed that Tokusho speak to students about his war experiences . Until then , Tokusho had tried to forget about the war and had always turned down similar requests . But the young teacher , a man named Kinjo , was persistent . He had just graduated from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his good intentions . Kinjo was accompanied by two female students who had participated in the oral history project , and when the two girls bowed repeatedly , begging Tokusho to share his war experiences with their class , he found himself unable to refuse . <p> The first time Tokusho stood in their sixth-grade classroom , he read from a paper he had prepared , not once looking up . Unaccustomed to speaking in standard Japanese , he raced through the paper , finishing what was scheduled to be a half-hour talk in just over fifteen minutes . After concluding , Tokusho timidly looked up at the students . A brief moment passed , then the classroom burst into applause . Tears still streaming down their faces , the students were clapping as hard as they could . Tokusho was bewildered ; he could n't understand what had so affected the children . Then he started receiving requests to speak at the village 's other elementary and junior high schools , and he was even asked to speak at the high school in the next town . <p> At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education had begun compiling oral histories of the war , and this brought Tokusho to the attention of newspaper reporters and university research teams , who soon began showing up at his door . Tokusho was even interviewed several times by television stations and was asked to speak to school groups visiting Okinawa from the Japanese mainland . At first he spoke with blind intensity , but eventually he began to grasp what his audience wanted to hear and learned not to appear too glib . At those times when he did forget himself , he would suddenly look up at the intent faces of the children , and feel ashamed or even frightened . <p> Angered by this , Ushi would warn , " You start fibbin ' and makin ' up sorry tales to profit off the war and you 'll get your fair punishment in the end . " Tokusho hardly needed her warnings , for as soon as he finished a lecture he always vowed to make it his last . Yet after hearing the applause , being handed a bouquet of flowers , and getting showered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contented . " This must be how it feels to have children or grandchildren , " he thought , and tears even filled his eyes . He took special pleasure in opening the envelope containing his honorarium after he got home . Tokusho squandered most of the money on liquor and gambling , but he also managed to buy a new sanshin and an expensive fishing rod with his earnings . <p> The children visiting Tokusho kept peeking at his leg , which was . draped with a large bath towel . " Please get well soon , " they said , one after another , leaving him flowers and origami cranes , the paper birds symbolizing restored health . For a moment Tokusho was ready to apologize for all of his lies , and he almost confessed about what he actually did on the battlefield . Almost , but not quite . Ushi 's words came to mind : " You 'll git your comeuppance for tryin ' to profit off people 's sufferin ' in the war . " <p> A soldier stared at Tokusho . The man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about twenty years old . Unlike the others , who now had gentle expressions on their faces , this particular soldier still looked tense . The young man bowed deeply , put his hand on his chest and grimaced , then slowly knelt down and began to drink . <p> After their company had been destroyed , Tokusho and the remaining troops kept moving and reassembled in a cave on the southern part of the island . The cave served as a field hospital , and the wounded were cared for by high school girls who had been conscripted as nurses . After they arrived at the field hospital , the girls , together with their teachers , checked to confirm who among their acquaintances in the cave had survived . In the days that followed , they were kept busy with messenger duty , carrying water and food supplies , and transporting corpses . <p> Tokusho had encountered this particular soldier while carrying a trough of urine and feces out of the cave . As he passed the wounded in their beds lined up against the wall , Tokusho did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , but one hand managed to grab the edge of the trough , causing the contents to spill onto the face of a wounded soldier . Tokusho cringed , expecting a harangue from the man . The soldier was near the entrance to the cave , and a dim light revealed his face , drenched in urine and excrement . He stuck out his tongue and licked the foul water that surrounded his lips . The bandage wrapped around his chest moved ceaselessly . His head rotated slowly , and Tokusho saw the man was staring at him from the very depths of his eyes . Surely this man wo n't last until tomorrow , thought Tokusho . " I 'll bring you water right away , " he said , stepping forward , but Tokusho never carried out his promise . <p> Now this man 's teeth rubbed against Tokusho 's toe as he sucked , and it hurt . The dripping seemed to have slowed . " Perhaps now I have fulfilled my promise , " thought Tokusho . But his sense of relief was outweighed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forever . <p> A soldier with a dented skull pressed his knee against the shoulder of the man in front of him . Reluctantly , the man stood up , and with fear in his eyes , looked at Tokusho . Then he bowed and disappeared through the wall , clutching his chest . The next soldier kneeled down and frantically began sucking on Tokusho 's toe . A fly zoomed off the wound on the man 's dented skull , buzzing around his head for a while before landing on the bed sheet and disappearing . This soldier had also grabbed Tokusho in the cave that day , begging for water . The tall soldier standing behind him , and the Okinawan soldier hidden behind him , and the one-eyed soldier who just now appeared out of the wall-all had been in the cave , extending their arms as they pleaded for water . Tokusho felt as if he was being dragged back into the cave 's shadows once again . Sensing someone outside , Seiyu hurriedly gathered together the money he had spread out on the floor and hid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flashlight , he peered through the window into the garden , closed the shutters , checked the latch , and again counted the money . <p> The water proved even more effective than Seiyu had imagined . Within a mere five minutes , fine hairs began growing on the freckled head of a man who had been bald for the past fifty years . A young high school teacher with thinning hair , who had initially scoffed at Seiyu 's claims , tried the water and , within three minutes , handed over nearly all of the money in his pockets . When applied to a person 's face , the rough epidermis would crack and peel off , replaced by a smooth and lustrous layer of new skin . When imbibed , a certain part of the anatomy that had dangled limply for years would now raise its head and reach for the abdomen . Skeptical customers had only to witness the eighty-seven-year-old man who stood rubbing his crotch , eyes twinkling like a contented elephant 's , before they too rushed off to purchase the water . Seiyu had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unreasonable , but he sold out in less than an hour . <p> During the first couple of days , Seiyu stood at an intersection in the next town and sold the water out of small sake serving bottles he had scrounged up . Starting on the third day , however , he ordered special brown bottles and attached red labels with " Miracle Water " written in gold ink , so that the product resembled a Chinese herbal medicine . He also moved to a new location , setting up shop at the corner of the town 's commercial district . Although he intended to be open for business between seven and eight in the evening , he always sold out in less than a half-hour . Rumors spread quickly and people began lining up at noontime . Even though Seiyu set a limit of one bottle per customer , there were never enough to go around . Frustrated customers would shout at him and refuse to leave , but he finally managed to assuage them by passing out " reserved " tickets for his next sale . Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per bottle , yet the number of customers kept growing . A few customers claimed to have had the contents analyzed and found that it was nothing more than water . Though they accused him of fraud , the product 's effectiveness was undeniable . One group of old men even began to worship Seiyu as if he were a god . <p> Seiyu put the money he 'd made in his bag and chuckled as he looked at his savings account passbook . Then he began to think of what he should do next . There was no doubt that the yakuza would soon get wind of the potential profits and demand a cut . The mass media had already been around twice to do stories on the water , and it seemed prudent to think about skipping town for the mainland before the tax bureau and public health insurance agency caught on . The dripping from Tokusho 's toe had slowed recently and barely filled three buckets per day . If Seiyu raised the price further he could pull in $10,000 in sales , but the rat smelled trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scared him , he was even more afraid of what Ushi would do if she found out , so he was careful about how much water he took each day . Only a few more days , he decided . Having dispensed with that problem , Seiyu lay down using his carrying bag as a pillow . He drifted off to sleep imagining all the massage parlors he would visit as he traveled from southern Kyushu all the way to Tokyo . <p> Two weeks had passed since Tokusho 's leg swelled up . It was July , and the cries of giant cicadas showered down on the sweltering summer days . The villagers had grown accustomed to Tokusho 's condition and now inquired about him as if asking about any bedridden elderly person . They seemed to have consigned his illness to that category of tales about villagers who suffered strange fates : for example , there was the story of the man who was blinded by a red habu snake hiding at a sacred site in the forest ; and the old woman , Makato , who is said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years old . Tokusho 's illness was unusual but not implausible , and the villagers nearly forgot about him . <p> Ushi had returned to her usual morning routine-waking up before six o'clock , sipping tea while sucking on a chunk of brown sugar , and then setting out for the fields to work before it got too hot . Seiyu would show up while Ushi was still drinking her morning tea and stay through the late afternoon . When he was n't taking care of Tokusho , Seiyu did the shopping , cut grass for the goats , and cleaned the house . He worked so hard that Ushi began to think he had lost his mind . It is true that the garden had become overgrown and she warned him about it once , but he answered that no matter how often he cut the grass it would grow back by the following morning . Although she thought he was lying , Ushi let the matter drop since he was working so hard at his other chores . <p> Ushi would return home at six in the evening and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and taking a bath , she ate dinner . Then she would sit by his bed and listen to the radio while telling him what happened in the village that day . Dr. Oshiro from the clinic stopped by regularly , alternating with the nurse . In addition to the I. v. they had placed Tokusho on a liquid diet , which was fed to him through a tube in his nose . Although he was somewhat thin , his skin actually appeared healthier than before , and since Tokusho could n't smoke or drink , his blood pressure had also improved . His leg was still swollen but the dripping seemed to have slowed , especially during the night , although no one was quite sure what to make of this . <p> Every time he visited , Dr. Oshiro recommended that Tokusho be admitted to the hospital . While she continued to insist that " you ca n't trust them big university hospitals , " Ushi privately began to waver . Tokusho 's condition was n't worsening , but there was no sign of improvement either . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of his life , Ushi began to feel desperate and admitted to herself that she did n't know what to do . Even during the war Ushi had never showed any weakness . <p> That night , just as Ushi left the room to go to bed , the soldiers appeared . As if he had been waiting since the last time , the first soldier rushed to place the toe in his mouth . The man 's mouth was so cold that it made Tokusho shudder , and he was so acutely aware of the movement of the soldier 's lips and tongue that he could n't sleep . Irritated at the banter of the other men , Tokusho tried yelling at them several times , but could only squeeze out a hoarse whisper and the soldiers paid him no heed . " If this goes on much longer I 'll go crazy , " he thought . He was unable to cover his ears or bury himself under the blankets , and several times he was awakened just as he 'd been on the verge of sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at five A.M. , he noticed Ishimine standing before him . Only the two of them were in the room . Until now , Ishimine had always averted his eyes , staring down at the floor , but now he looked directly at Tokusho . Tokusho craned his neck forward and tried to speak , but no words came forth . Ishimine looked down again , grabbed onto the metal bed frame to support his unsteady body , and slowly crouched down . Gently , he took Tokusho 's toe into his mouth and licked it , though there was little water coming out . <p> Tokusho recalled the night that he and Ishimine separated . They had gone out to get water when a rocket from a battleship exploded nearby . The three schoolgirls helping them were killed instantly . Ishimine 's stomach was split open from shrapnel , and Tokusho was the only one left who could move . Ishimine was moaning and gripping his stomach . Between his fingers oozed something that looked like the guts of a slaughtered pig or goat . Tokusho untied his cloth leggings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him back to the cave . As soon as he set foot inside the cave , Tokusho was assailed by the soldiers ' demands for water and food , so he left Ishimine lying near the entrance and hurried out to draw water . <p> That night the cave got noisier . The soldiers had been ordered to redeploy , and everyone able to walk was to take whatever he could carry and head south . <p> Cries for help of soldiers afraid to be left behind and the angry reprimands of their officers mingled together in the pale shadows . Sounds of men packing supplies mixed with the patter of the rain that had begun to fall echoed in Tokusho 's ears as he sat beside Ishimine . Tokusho was trying to think : he knew there was something important he should do , but no matter how hard he tried , he could not figure out what it was . <p> The cave , formed by Ryukyu limestone , was located midway up a small , forested mountain . The pouring rain fell on the tree leaves , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tokusho 's and Ishimine 's skin as they hid behind a stone wall near the cave 's entrance . <p> Two sentries took their rifles and quickly moved down the hill through the forest . The redeployment had begun . One after another , dark lumps would appear from the shadows and slowly assume a human form before descending the slope . Tokusho held Ishimine in his arms and pressed against the wall , hardly daring to breathe as he watched the soldiers go . Few of the men could walk normally , so they supported themselves on each other 's shoulders or with canes . As they slid down the slope , they became entangled and cursed each other , then exchanged muted cries of " Shut up ! " The girls from the Student Nurse Corps passed by carrying one of their wounded on a stretcher , then a shadow approached from the group . It was Miyagi Setsu . After learning that Tokusho and Ishimine were from her own group of villages , she had always stopped by to say hello . " How is Ishimine-san ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letting out shallow breaths . He looked as if he would fall to pieces if not supported . Tokusho shook his head at Setsu , who asked nothing more . Coarse fingers gripped Tokusho 's wrist , squeezing hard . A canteen and paper bag were forced into his palm . Tokusho tried to refuse , pushing her hand away , but Setsu brought her face close and said , " We 're heading for the surgery shelter in Itoman , so be sure to follow us ! " She spoke forcefully , grabbing his shoulder . Then she reached out , gently touched Ishimine 's face and said goodbye . Tokusho watched as her pigtailed figure slid down the hill and disappeared into the forest shadows . <p> Tokusho was n't sure how long he had been sitting there . The shapes of the men passing before him had grown flattened and twisted . Soldiers leaning on canes were now replaced by those crawling on all fours or dragging themselves along on their stomachs , shadowy figures squirming forward on arms and legs like halfsubmerged amphibians . Mixing with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cries , and pleadings of those left behind . Tokusho listened vacantly to the moaning of those soldiers who had slid off the cliff and could n't climb back up . <p> " Tokusho , " someone called faintly . <p> " Ishimine . . . " Tokusho spoke directly into his ear , but there was no reply . He brought his head closer and could hear shallow breathing . Tokusho turned around and lay Ishimine on the ground . The makeshift bandage he had wrapped around Ishimine 's stomach had become twisted and was making a slight sound . Tokusho took out a piece of dried bread from the paper bag Setsu had given him and placed it in Ishimine 's hand . Tokusho then poured some water from the canteen into his own palm and let it drip between the rows of white teeth that shown through Ishimine 's parted lips . The moment Tokusho saw the water overflow and drip down Ishimine 's cheek , he could no longer restrain himself . He put the canteen to his own mouth and gorged himself . When he caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of water spread through his entire body , creating a searing pain as if they were tiny shards of glass . Tokusho fell to his knees and stared at Ishimine , who lay on the ground where he was slowly absorbed by the shadows and muddy water . He looked too heavy to carry . No voices could be heard in the shelter . Tokusho set down the empty canteen beside Ishimine . " Forgive me , " he said . <p> Tokusho slid down the slope , tree branches hitting him in the face , then took off running through the forest . Moonlight shone on a white limestone path , and fallen soldiers lay humped over like dark shellfish . Across the path he could see the tail of a black snake , its scales peeling off one by one . Tokusho ran after it and tripped over the outstretched arm of a soldier who appeared to be dead . The man began crawling toward Tokusho , who pushed his arm away and stood up , but a sharp pain shot through his ankle . Tokusho was now terrified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he took off running again . An explosion suddenly ripped through the air behind him . Flashes of light pierced the middle of the forest . Afraid of being left behind , Tokusho continued to run , cursing those Japanese soldiers along the way who had killed themselves with hand grenades . <p> Four days later , Tokusho was taken prisoner by the Americans at Mabuni on the southern tip of the island . He had lain unconscious on the beach , waves lapping beside him , when he was rescued . During his time in the internment camp and even after returning to the village , Tokusho worried that someone might suddenly appear and accuse him of abandoning Ishimine in the cave . <p> Roughly one week after returning to the village , Ishimine 's mother came to visit . She brought potatoes and canned goods saved from the American rations , and rejoiced at Tokusho 's survival as if he were her own kin . Tokusho found himself unable to look her in the eye . He lied , saying that he had lost sight of Ishimine as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him afterwards . In the hectic years that followed the war , Tokusho tried to erase his memories of Ishimine . <p> The whereabouts of Tokusho 's father , Shutoku , remained unknown since he first went off to serve in the Defense Forces . Tokusho 's grandfather and two younger sisters all died of malaria shortly after being released from an American internment camp , so his only close relatives left after the war were his mother , grandmother , and infant brother . His mother , Tomi , had always been sickly . She could not produce enough milk to feed his brother , whose face was covered with sores and was constantly surrounded by flies . His brother died before reaching his first birthday . Tokusho relied on his grandmother to care for Tomi , who could barely get out of bed . Claiming to be older than his eighteen years , Tokusho found work during the days carrying freight on a U.S. military dock ; in the early mornings and evenings he worked in the fields . Two years later Tomi died , leaving Tokusho alone with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ village . He tried working as a day laborer in the thriving base towns concentrated in the center of the island , then as a house painter in Naha , but he never lasted long in these jobs . At twenty-five he returned to the village , built a rowboat out of an empty U.S. military fuel tank , and when he was n't working in the fields , he 'd take the boat out for spearfishing to make some extra money . At twenty-seven he met and moved in with Ushi , who peddled fish from door to door in the village . His grandmother could n't have been happier . Ushi was two years older than Tokusho , and although she was a strong-willed woman , she had a big heart . During the next three years until Tokusho 's grandmother died , Ushi took even better care of her than she did of her own parents . After his grandmother 's death , Tokusho and Ushi lived alone . Tokusho began drinking more heavily and started gambling as well . Ushi attributed this to her infertility , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet there was another reason for Tokusho 's heavy drinking . At the ceremony commemorating the forty-ninth day after his grandmother 's death , he overhead a conversation among the old women of the village and inadvertently learned what happened to Miyagi Setsu . <p> By the time Tokusho reached the cave that served as an infirmary , it had already been bombed . The Americans had used the " horse rider strategy , " in which they straddled the top of the cave and pitched explosives inside . Tokusho could not discover Setsu 's whereabouts and was forced to flee to Mabuni beach at the southernmost tip of the island . The previous day , Setsu and her group had traveled nearly the same course and reached the cliffs at Mabuni . Atop the rocks , less than two hundred meters from where Tokusho would lie unconscious from a bomb blast , waves lapping at his body , Setsu and her five classmates took out a hand grenade and killed themselves . <p> After his relatives and the others returned home , Tokusho walked down to the shore alone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had given him the canteen and dried bread , who had placed her hand on his shoulder . Sadness and then rage welled up inside him , and he was suddenly overcome by a desire to kill those who drove Setsu to her death . At the same time , he was forced to acknowledge a sense of relief that no one was left who knew the truth about Ishimine . Tokusho wanted to sob yet no tears would come . It was then that he began drinking heavily . Since that time he thought he had succeeded in forcing the memories of Ishimine and Setsu from his mind . <p> Ishimine wrapped his palms soothingly around Tokusho 's ankles and was drinking intently . A cool breeze blew through the room . From outside the window and across the sea , Tokusho sensed a glimmer of dawn light . Normally the soldiers would have disappeared by this time . Tokusho 's robe had fallen open , revealing a stomach flabby from drink . He found the sight repulsive-the pale skin of his stomach , the sparse hairs surrounding his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gourd . Tokusho realized that he was growing old fast , and he feared having to spend the rest of his life in bed , face to face with those memories that he had repressed for over fifty years . <p> " Ishimine , forgive me ! " <p> The color had begun to return to Ishimine 's pale face , and his lips regained their luster . Tokusho , despite his fear and self-hatred , grew aroused . Ishimine 's tongue glided across the opening on his toe , and then Tokusho let out a small cry as he released his sexual energy . The lips pulled away . Lightly wiping his mouth with his index finger , Ishimine stood up . He was still seventeen . A smile took shape-around those eyes that stared out beneath the long lashes , on the spare cheeks , on the vermilion lips . <p> Tokusho burst into anger . " Do n't you know how much I 've suffered these past fifty years ? ! " Ishimine merely continued to smile , nodding slightly at Tokusho , who flailed his arms in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At last the thirst is gone . " Speaking in well-accented , standard Japanese , Ishimine held back a smile , saluted , and bowed deeply . He never turned to look back at Tokusho as he slowly vanished into the wall . A newt scampered across the stained wall and caught an insect . <p> At dawn , Tokusho 's wail echoed throughout the village . Seiyu arrived at the house earlier than usual and was surprised to find Ushi sitting near Tokusho 's pillow and crying . Seiyu had never expected to see tears from Ushi , and at first he thought that Tokusho might have died during the night . He timidly took a peek and found Tokusho 's eyes wide open and rolling toward him . " All cured , " announced Tokusho , his unshaven face breaking into a grin . Then he said no more and closed his eyes . Seiyu looked down at Tokusho 's leg to discover that the swelling had completely subsided and the dripping had stopped . Roughly a centimeter of water covered the bottom of the bucket . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tiptoe out of the room , but Ushi noticed and called him back in . Breaking into a cold sweat , Seiyu turned around . Ushi stepped toward him , not even trying to wipe the tears that stained her face . Seiyu was ready to bolt , but Ushi grabbed his hand and held on tight . " I just wan na ' thank ya ' . It 's on account of your help that he 's all better . " Then she took an envelope out from her bosom and bowed as she pressed it into Seiyu 's hand . <p> " He 's my cousin , ai n't he ? Hey , anybody 'd do the same thing , " said Seiyu , forcing a smile . Then he promised to return later . As soon as he left the room , he took off running for his house . Now that the water had stopped dripping , there was no reason to stick around the village . He picked up the tote bag containing his money and a change of clothes and went to the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxi . The cab was comfortably air-conditioned , and as Seiyu caught his breath he remembered the envelope in his pocket . He peeked inside and found three io , ooo notes . For Ushi , this was quite an extravagant display . Although he felt a twinge of guilt , Seiyu reminded himself that he had actually helped take care of Tokusho . He told the taxi driver to hurry . He had reserved an airline ticket but still had one week before his flight and planned to spend the time at a hotel in Naha . He rubbed the carrying bag on the seat beside him . In addition to the Y500,000 in his carrying bag , Seiyu had over Y10,000,000 in a bank account . Yet his bag contained more than just cash and clothes . He had also stored some of the " water " in four stainless steel thermoses . Now he opened one of the thermoses and took a sip , together with a swig of whiskey . Before he knew it an itching began in his crotch . Seiyu thought about his travel plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where he planned to close up his shop . <p> When Seiyu saw a rowdy crowd of several hundred gathered in front of the shop , he closed the taxi door . At first he thought they were waiting to buy the water , but as he was deciding whether to get out of the taxi , he saw something ominous about the crowd . Everyone was covered with hats , masks , or sunglasses , and some people even carried steel bats and karate weapons . Just as Seiyu was urging the driver to leave , someone noticed him . In an instant the taxi was surrounded , and Seiyu and his bag were dragged out into the street . Someone held his head . He tried to crouch down , but several hands pulled him to his feet . <p> A man yelled into his ear , " Git up , you rotten bastard ! " <p> " Yeah , what 's really in this water , anyhow ? " A bottle was thrust in front of his eyes , and at the bottom a small amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's the miracle water . . . " replied Seiyu , but before he could finish a woman 's hand slapped him across the face . <p> " Miracle water , my ass ! " The woman tried to grab Seiyu , but the others restrained her . The tip of a high-heeled shoe then stuck Seiyu in the shin . Groaning , he bent over to rub his shin , but a man standing directly in front of him pulled him up by the collar . <p> " You son of a bitch ! Take a look at what that rotten water did to me ! " <p> The man removed his hat and mask , then took off his sunglasses . His head contained only a sparse covering of a repulsive baby fluff that resembled moss , and his face was covered with splotches and wrinkles . <p> " What are you going to do about this ? " Half crying , the man shouted at Seiyu . It was the high-school teacher , Seiyu 's second customer to purchase the water . One after another , those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunglasses . Both the men and women had lost their hair , and with their splotches and moss-covered faces they all looked like eighty-year-olds . Seiyu quickly brought his hand up to his own head , and the hair fell out between his fingers . <p> " Oh , my god ! " Seiyu 's cry was cut short by a fist , and he was pressed up against the door of the taxi . His face , reflected in the window glass , seemed to crumble before his eyes . His tote bag was torn open and money floated through the air . Cars stopped , causing a chain collision , and people on their way to work rushed to the scene . As horns blared and curses flew back and forth , Seiyu , down on all fours , tried to crawl away , but someone grabbed him by the collar and shoved him down on the sidewalk . Karate weapons , high heels , and fists as bony as bird 's feet continued to assail Seiyu , who was crouched down like a frightened mouse . A woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrinkles were so deep that her flesh dangled in multiple folds , took three of the canteens and climbed atop the taxi , where she began sprinkling unsuspecting bystanders with the water and laughing at the top of her lungs . While the mob went wild , overturning taxis and police cars that had rushed to the scene , one of the canteens rolled away . It passed through the legs of the crowd and fell into the river , where it floated out to sea , sparkling in the early morning sunlight . Ten days had passed . Tokusho gazed out the window at the summer grass in the garden . The soldiers had ceased to appear since the dripping stopped , yet Tokusho was afraid to sleep alone , so for the first few days he had Ushi sleep beside his bed . And , though she protested , Ushi did not mind doing this one bit . Tokusho kept the light on at all times and listened as Ushi told him everything that had happened in the village while he was bedridden . Tokusho had trouble deciding whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to drink each night , but ultimately he could n't bring himself to talk about them . In fact , he realized that he would probably never be able to tell her . Once his strength returned , however , he did want to visit the cave together with Ushi . He would merely explain that he had hidden there during the war . They would offer flowers and look for any human bones that still remained . Having made this decision , however , Tokusho was afraid that he 'd start putting things off and allow his memories to fade-that he would again try to forget about Ishimine . He even began drinking again despite his repeated vows never to touch another drop . When he went to pay a sick call on Seiyu , who had been confined to bed since his beating , Tokusho ran into some his old drinking pals who had stopped by , and he ended up joining them . Seiyu had to drink the awamori through a straw since both his arms were broken , but the party continued even after he passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next morning Ushi found Tokusho asleep outside the gate in front of their house . She gave him a sharp kick and headed for the fields without saying a word . <p> " Starting tomorrow I 'll go out to the fields and work , " Tokusho told himself . He decided to cut the overgrown grass in order to regain his strength , so he went to the shed , got out the sickle and stepped down to the back garden . The grass had grown as high as his waist . He was amazed at its vitality but also worried that a habu snake might be hiding in the tall grass . Taking a stick , he started beating around the roots . Then he hit something firm and the stick rebounded . Sifting through the grass , beneath a hedge of Chinese hibiscus , lay an enormous gourd melon too big for even Tokusho to carry . <p> Fine hairs glistened on the deep green skin . Tokusho gasped in surprise , then gave it a kick but it would n't budge . A long vine , thick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hibiscus . At the end of the vine , a yellow flower swayed against the blue sky . The flower was so bright it made Tokusho 's eyes brim with tears . <p>
