Mirror Image of a Young Man in Balance <p> It is with benign indifference that I look upon the fact that I live in a world that talks so fast it has to breathe through its backside . Words no longer incite me . I 'm an abandoned building  --  let 's just say a forsaken and forgotten observatory . The world blows through my broken windowpanes without leaving a trace . <p> It no longer means anything whether people believe me . They can read this as they like . As a confession , as a prayer , as a small , cold fable , as a whimper . As for me , I see it as the closest man can come to the truth . <p> I am writing this because something has happened in my life that has made me completely free of what one calls feelings . <p> Not many messages can have made it through from the universe I find myself in . Those I 've heard proclaim that they have risen above their emotions once and for all were usually drowning in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaven , bloated like corpses that have washed ashore from their self-conceit . <p> I ca n't say that my own life has been beyond reproach . But ever since that night , the night before the 20th of March 1929 , it has been golden through and through . So it does n't matter how deeply you scratch . Ever since that night , my relationship to love , desire , jealousy , and loneliness has been different from other people 's . Ever since that night , I have been free . <p> Of what the world calls feeling , there is only one that I acknowledge as mine  --  a faint anger that I putter with because it warms me . I have never understood it . Something tells me that now , tonight , I 'm going to understand it . <p> I design and construct mirrors . So did my father and his father before him . I became an engineer ; they did n't . But the credit is due to the way things change , not to me . The most profound truth about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For this state , the changes people call progress have no meaning . The substance of my work does not differ from that of my father or of my grandfather . <p> This is as it should be . We ca n't say or do anything that has n't been said or done before . It is n't only when we speak that we repeat ourselves and others . Our actions are cliches as well . <p> If it still makes sense to call me an artist , it 's not because of what I have accomplished but what I wanted to do . <p> I dreamed of creating a mirror that would reproduce the world as it really is . In a way , it is this dream that has made me pure . <p> The history of Europe recognizes two interpretations of mirrors : truth and dream . Ovid writes that the surface of the water was adjusted by Nemesis so it showed Narcissus a shadow that he erroneously took to be a real person . <p> In the mirror from the First Letter to the Corinthians one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In the emblematic lexicons of the Middle Ages , the mirror is the symbol of vanitas , pride , one of the Seven Deadly Sins . <p> Hans Christian Andersen 's and Lewis Carroll 's mirrors are menacing , unreliable . In Offenbach , Dapertuto steals people 's souls by stealing their reflections . <p> These mirrors are all deceitful . Like the ones we know . We know that we never see ourselves in a mirror as we really are . Depending on our state of mind , we see ourselves as misunderstood and abandoned or as those whom the universe loves or as animals beneath a thin veneer of humanity . But never do we see ourselves as we really must be . As composed of all these partial truths . A mirror is always a screen upon which people project their longing for equilibrium . <p> The second mirror that history recognizes is a dream . It is the fearless mirror in Snow White . It is Shakespeare ' s mirror behind Hamlet 's directions to the players to hold " the mirror up to nature . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call so many of its manuscript collections specula to insure that they were exhaustive and reliable . In the Orient it is the mirror of the historical Buddha , Shakyamuni , as described by the poet Ashvaghosa at the beginning of the Golden Age of Buddhism : " During the night 's second watch , he received the highest Heavenly vision .... With it he saw the whole world which appeared to him as if reflected in a perfect mirror . " These reflections are absolutely reliable because they are incorruptible : they remain unaffected by that which they reflect . <p> I was searching for such a mirror . Now that everything has been put behind me , I can confess that my thirst for reality had a connection to my relationship to women . <p> I knew that the worst thing of all in the world is to be abandoned . Sooner or later we will all be abandoned . For that reason , separation was something I practiced every day . I left the women in my life in order not to lose my training in abandoning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them . Woman is the only being on earth for whom the act of association is one long mutual leave taking . They became more alien to me for each day that I knew them . <p> At one point , I began to fear that I might bear some part of the blame for this chain of departures . It was then that I began to think about the Mirror . I wished to have it as a neutral judge , a fixed point and witness to the truth in that night of passions during which the battles of love play themselves out . <p> In May 1927 they asked me if I would construct the reflecting telescope for the new Nordic Observatory above Delsjon , outside of Gothenburg . I accepted . <p> I knew that the observatory was intended as a monument to Nordic conciliation . Back then , there were strikes every day all across Europe . We knew that an economic crisis of hitherto unknown proportions was on the way . Without the slightest doubt , I awaited a new world war . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concert out toward the stars . As is the case with all monumental national illusions , this purpose  --  for those who made the decisions  --  was half conscious , half unrecognized . From its beginning , I saw the project for what it was . <p> People have asked me why I nevertheless made myself available . <p> What should I say ? We know so little about what cause we are actually serving . When Kepler published his optic theories in " Supplement to Witelo " in 1604 , he thought he was confirming the existence of God . History has shown that he took a decisive step along a road that was to transform beyond recognition the surroundings in which he wrote . <p> If people asked again , as some did , why I participated in a political fraud , I replied that after all I had to make a living . <p> Those who asked again I promised a kick in the pants . <p> This was four years before they built the reflector for the Mount Palomar Observatory .

People were still discussing whether the future did n't belong to refracting telescopes . <p> Over the course of the summer of ' 27 , we erected the work hall , during the winter , the ceramic furnace . The following winter , I poured the mirror . <p> I wo n't say anything about the research that led me to choose a silver-coated glass mirror . About my development of homogeneous glass types . About my silver coating . About the sleep that I sacrificed in order , for the first time in history , to violate the principle that had told us for 200 years that the light absorption of a mirror can never be less than 50 percent . I want to show you the stars , not regale you with how difficult it is to reach them . <p> I made nineteen unsuccessful attempts . The last , successful cooldown lasted thirty-one days . Without pride , without anger , without remorse , I can say that no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the furnace . <p> It was a perfect concave mirror , one section of a spherical surface whose imaginary center was located 170 feet away . Its aperture was twenty-three feet in diameter . Language is inadequate here . I have no desire to say anything more about the sight . <p> At that point , we heard about her for the first time . Her reputation preceded her , as if she were the world 's greatest whore or the world 's greatest opera diva ; She was a glass grinder . <p> I set out to find her . I followed the miracles she had performed . Just off the Frisian Islands , I saw a golden disk on the superstructure of the ship , as if the moon had been brought down onto the deck . But it was n't the moon . It was a blinding , white circle of light that was coming from a lighthouse ten nautical miles away . The cylinder of rays had n't been scattered ; its diameter was half a yard , just as when it left that unthinkable , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They said she had given it as a gift to the Dutch government . <p> In Vienna I visited the new orangery . She had ground curved mirrors for the ellipsoid walls that reproduced the interior of the room in such a way that it was difficult to induce visitors to step inside the door because they saw the room of 300 square feet merge into an endless and trackless forest of orange and lemon trees in which they seemed certain to be lost . <p> I did n't find her . She had always just left a site when I arrived ; that is the way women are . At last I went back to Gothenburg . And there she was . <p> She ordered everyone but me to leave the hall ; then she went to work . <p> First she undressed . I attempted to explain the spherical aberration , the structural defects of the concave mirror . I do n't know whether she was listening . I do n't know whether she understood me . She must have been about five feet three inches tall , half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been among the first to escape the prohibition against emigration that applied to the glass grinders of Venice in the Middle Ages . They had fled to the East . <p> She took off all her clothes with the exception of a long cloth she had wound around her hips . Her skin was white , like the mixture of beeswax and tallow they make altar candles from . Around her feet and hands she had white cotton rags . She sprinkled a mixture of crushed magnesium and diamond dust on them . Then she climbed out onto the mirror and began to grind . <p> I remember that occasion as one instant . In reality it may have lasted three , possibly four days . The roof above us was of glass ; the mirror collected the daylight . She moved on the pulverized gems as if she were on a cold blue fire . She worked slowly but her body was always covered with sweat . Her reflections hung suspended in the drifting glass dust above the mirror like inverted , contorted , three-dimensional fragments of herself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what made her do it . I do n't have an answer . I ca n't say that I like myself . I tolerate myself because I know we will be together until death do us part . But I have never believed other people could love me . I have never thought that I could offer women anything other than my boyish charm , and I do n't believe in that anymore either . It may have been because of the mirror . If so , she was disappointed . The artist is always so much shabbier than his work . <p> In any case she worried me . When she had completed her grinding , I sent her away . <p> Only then did I coat the mirror with silver . Then we set up the telescope and aimed it at the heavens . We took a series of photographs . We saw what no man had seen before . We saw the first quasar . We saw the planet Pluto . We saw a stellar nebula that seemed to be in the process of disintegrating and that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an inexplicable dark body that surprised us all . The astronomers said they thought it was a celestial phenomenon that augured fame and fortune . I knew it had to be a foreign body on the mirror . The following day I examined the glass . I did n't find anything . On the next photographs the shadow had moved and changed shape . Then I put a finely meshed square grid over the mirror and localized with certainty the place where the grain of dust had to be . I trained a microscope on the glass . I saw only the light source of my instrument . Nothing other than my own reflection met me . <p> Then I understood that the mirror had to be alive . I looked speculatively at my colleagues and saw that they were satisfied , that they were congratulating me and each other on our achievement , and that they were looking forward to the dedication . That without any trouble they were expelling that small , itinerant shadow amoeba from their worldview . <p> Then I set out after her . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the world in search of a woman . Odysseus sets off after one and returns home to another . And Tristan . And Solomon . <p> I mention this because I desire history 's guarantee that I 'm not the only idiot who has been ready to travel halfway around the world in search of a woman . I thought at the time that what was driving me was the idea that she , who had made the dead glass come alive , had to have The Mirror . Now , when my mind is polished granite , I can permit myself to say that I also missed her . <p> I caught up with her in Copenhagen . She was preparing an exhibition of her mirrors and lenses in the Tivoli amusement park . I climbed over the park ' s wrought-iron fence at night . <p> She was alone . <p> " You 've come to see The Mirror , " she said . <p> " So it does exist ? " I asked . <p> " Yes , " she said . Then she told me about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said , " sees what he wishes or fears to see . I have always known that if I were to fashion a mirror that showed reality , the mirror itself would have to be alive , an organism that sensed the mood of the viewer and showed an image that was corrected for that mood . " <p> She led me over to a corner . Up against the wall stood a rectangle as tall as a man , wrapped in a yellow cloth . It could have been a painting . She took the fabric away . At first it looked like an ordinary mirror . <p> Then I saw that in the dark room , it shone very faintly with a light that seemed to come from a point beneath the surface of the mirror . Now I also saw that it was n't completely at rest . that at its edge there was a faint undulating , plasmatic movement . I stepped over in front of it . <p> I will say it again : no one has to believe what I am reporting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I lie awake , I speculate whether my memory might have been impaired . These thoughts do n't put me to sleep . But they do give my sleeplessness a sort of meaning . <p> I first saw my own reflection as I knew it . As I thought I knew it . But my face was distorted . I felt my skin and found that it was quiet . I understood that The Mirror knew that my self-control was forced . In order to approach the truth , it was showing me an exaggerated image of my agitation . <p> Then the image began to move . It turned into a series of disjointed , lopsided representations of myself . I tried to take in each one of them . Then their speed increased . I concentrated on the image The Mirror was giving of my outward appearance . Then I disappeared from its surface , and instead a series of tableaux whirled by me , which I recognized as my innermost fears and desires . What I was witnessing was The Mirror 's attempt to compensate for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that moment . <p> I put my hands in front of my eyes . I tried to stay calm in order to slow The Mirror down . I told myself that no matter what it showed , I would regard it coolly and calmly because I was convinced that it was the truth . <p> When I took my hands away , I saw the room I was standing in . I recognized the wide , rough floorboards and the walls ' combination of gilt and smoke-blackened gray . But I myself was gone , and the room was no longer naturalistic ; instead , it was twisting in spiral coils out into infinity . <p> The Mirror had registered my anticipation about the truth . In order to offset this projection , it was showing me an undeniable fallacy . <p> I had always thought that there was something donkeylike and rustic in my character that would limit my world but that would also protect me from insanity . Now I realized that this too was a delusion . That I was participating in a cruel game here from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal , square makeup mirror from the wall and held it up in front of The Mirror , to force it to show the truth about itself . It answered not with me , not with the mirror I was holding , but by showing the wall behind me and only that . <p> I looked out at the woman , and at that instant The Mirror revealed that I would give everything  --  even the sight of The Mirror  --  to be able to put my face against her luminescent skin . I saw my love exposed , and I hated my own dependence , and it occurred to me that I could kill her . Simultaneous with my thoughts , my hands in The Mirror were around her throat . Then I took a step forward to destroy her , she who was the only witness to my nakedness , but The Mirror saw through me and showed me kneeling in front of her , blubbering with cowardice . <p> I could not walk away from The Mirror , but I turned my back to it . What I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mirror 's meticulous , flat reality . It had had a more profound spatiality than anything I 'd seen before . I was no longer certain whether it was the world in The Mirror or the world outside of it that was real . <p> " How , my flower , " I said to her , " can I know that you are and exist yourself and are n't just a construction of light which this mirror has created ? " <p> " You can never know that , " she said . " I 'm not even certain myself . When I close my eyes , I can see images from the time when I made The Mirror . But of course those memories might have been created by The Mirror when it produced me . " <p> Since then I have been aware that her doubts will always be my own as well . Am I the one who is writing about what I once experienced ? Or does this account add something or other to my life so that it must be said that I come into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain sense then , it is this report that makes me what I am ? And how does it transform me ? When Poe wrote about mirrors  --  as in " Von Jung the Mystific , " as in " The Philosophy of Furniture "  --  he himself became superficial , glib , perfunctory , as if his own language had become a mirror . Will the same thing happen in my case ? <p> The history of science in Europe has been unable to settle the debate of antiquity between the followers of Aristotle and Galen : the question about the extent to which he who sees passively receives an optical impression of reality or shapes what he sees himself . Before the woman on the floor , I understood that the dialogue had always been meaningless because the question itself had been a mistake . It presupposes that there is a stable reality to observe . There is n't . The moment we regard the world , it begins to change . And we change with it . To look at reality is not to comprehend a structure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with unforeseeable consequences . <p> I turned toward The Mirror . I knew that if I chased after its images , they would flee . If I ran from them , they would pursue me . What I asked of them , they would deny me . What I feared most , they would stuff down my throat . The history of Europe is the history of a boundless faith in the power of the will . At that moment , I saw the infinite limitations of this will . All that I could choose to do in the face of this mirror was to place myself in front of it and give up or to do nothing at all . <p> In his memoirs Carl Gustav Jung tells of the moment when he is sitting at his desk and for the first time in his life decides to let himself be swallowed up by his inner images . Perhaps it is fear that makes people let go . Perhaps it is desperation . In any case , it is n't courage . <p> The Mirror showed me my physical person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I had given up because it let me fall . The room around me disappeared . Somewhere on the fringe of perceptions was the woman . <p> I do n't assign any particular meaning to what I saw . In " The Aleph " Borges saw all points of the universe at one and the same moment . What I saw was infinitely less . And it was successive . It was like steps on a stairway . I do n't know whether they led up or down , whether toward or away . <p> I saw a bottomless valley that was full of fog . I saw spiral-coiled towers made of light . I saw a woman with a dark face and a name which in a Nilotic language signified the blue-gray hour before sunrise when her mother gave birth to her in a ditch . <p> I saw one mirror . After that , infinitely many mirrors that reflected each other 's emptiness . After that , the mirror they held up to Rasmus Rask 's lips to see whether he was alive . After that , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road from Tamale to Mecca . The two years that the pilgrimage lasted ( how does one see two years ? ) . After that , the fragrance of Vinho Cheiro from Terceira ( how does one see a fragrance ? ) . A drinking bowl , lacquered 3000 years ago on a rowboat three days ' sail from the coast in the Yellow Sea . <p> I saw the great builders of systems and their work . Linnaeus with his botanist 's case in Lapland . The last Buddha to date . Thomas Aquinas . His commentary on De Anima . Hegel during his inaugural lecture in Berlin . Wagner . The last mathematical polyhistor , Poincare . The shadow of a man who might have been the Savior . The paragraph in De Caelo  --  I think it was 56  --  where Swedenborg writes that the earthly realm is a mirror image of the Heavenly . <p> After that , the great cosmologies . The Mirror showed me a world that is flowing . A world that is burning . A world consisting of disparate parts . <p> Which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A world of concentric circles . A world that is an illusion . There is a plant there . A world that is moved by ideas . That is moved by people . By gods . By reason . By the laws of economics . A world that does n't exist except as the dream of a being who does n't exist either . <p> Then there was silence for a moment . Then came the emptiness . It came not as an absence . It came as a presence , as a perceptible vacuum that stepped out of The Mirror and drew me to itself . <p> He who knows the emptiness will understand me . It is a suction in space . <p> It swallowed me up and then disgorged me . <p> People are ineluctably alike and ineluctably different . Emptiness can be a baptism , a river , a cornerstone , an annihilation , a cross , a new algebra . For me it meant that I was irrevocably liberated from love . <p> Without being completely sure , I think  --  stated quietly and calmly  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what those who spend their lives seeking are seeking after . They must have seen the emptiness. and for the rest of their lives they attempt to experience it again . I now understood why Jesus needed to contradict himself every third sentence , why Buddha had to resort to miracles , and Muhammad had to threaten , and Meister Eckhart had to insist that his own isolation should be shared by us all . They had all seen the emptiness , and they wanted to return to it . <p> The great systems that tell the world about truth and life always claim to be comprehensive and balanced . In reality they are timid bridge buildings of yearning . I saw that , and it made me pure and clear like rock crystal . <p> Unfortunately , I am forgetting what I saw . To be sure , I have seen it again .

It 's because I am afraid of my dependence on her . A life with her would be hell . A life without her would be worse . I have seen something precious , but I am only human . That 's what is wrong ; because a human being is frail , it falls into decay , it forgets , it fails , it depreciates , it devaluates , it is stricken with moral and intellectual inflation . <p> If only I could remember what it felt like to be humble and thereby master of the situation . But oblivion devours my humility . I am writing this with an increasing , fatalistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the air . I ca n't hold on to my pencil . My love for her is unique . It is enormous . Where is my peace of mind ? My awareness of cliches ? My cynicism ? My karmic clarification ? My mirrors ? Where is the woman ? Help ! <p> Translated by Frank Hugus <p> Peter Hoeg ( b. 1957 ) is the most enthusiastically received Danish writer to come along in quite some time . His first book , Forestilling om det tyvende arhundrede ( Intimations of the Twentieth Century ) , published in 1988 when he was thirty-one years old , was widely praised by Danish critics , earning him the tnle of foremost storyteller of his generation . Two years later , Fortaellinger om natten ( Tales of the Night ) appeared , a collection of stories with a postmodernist sense of language and image set during the crisis year of 1929 . Smilla 's Sense of Snow ( 1992 ) is a sociological thriller that takes place in Denmark and Greenland and contains nearly as much lore as Moby-Dick differing in that Hoeg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the greater purposes of his fictions . Nonetheless , Smilla conveys an awareness of Greenland , its snow , its ice , its history , and the threat to its nature , all of which makes this fiction an important statement about our time . Hoeg 's books have been translated into many languages . In 1993 Smilla 's Sense of Snow appeared in English from Farrar , Straus and Giroux and made the New York Times Best-Seller List ; it was followed in 1994 by Borderliners , also from Farrar , Straus and Giroux . Smilla was recently released in paperback by Dell . <p> The story here is from Fortaellinger om natten . It is a dramatic meditation on human identity that combines the qualities of a metafiction and a Pensee with a sharp sense of language , image , and eccentric metaphor , a story not soon forgotten . Peter Hoeg 's books are published by Rosinante ( Copenhagen ) . <p>
