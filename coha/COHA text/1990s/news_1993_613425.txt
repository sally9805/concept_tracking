<p> Many Atlanta arts leaders say they do n't have a clear understanding of the overall vision for the Cultural Olympiad , and they are worried that the ticking clock is getting louder . Unsure of their role in the four-year arts program accompanying the ' 96 Games and without a master plan to guide them , some say they are falling behind in their own planning and fund raising . <p> " It 's weird to be in a city that can gain so much from this but seems not to understand what 's at stake , not to be able to move the ball off the pitching mound , " says Hammonds House Galleries director Ed Spriggs . <p> Adds Jack Shultz of the Fulton County Arts Council , " There 's been a general concern from the beginning about a lack of overall vision . The Olympiad seems to be proceeding ad hoc . " <p> The Olympiad , which was launched with last winter 's broad-ranging " Winterland " festival of Norwegian arts and which recently wrapped up a modest Swiss salute , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next fall . Olympiad officials say they are preparing to announce their master plan sometime in July . <p> But most arts leaders contacted were unaware of the imminence of the master plan announcement , and complained about generally being kept in the dark . In lieu of specifics , rumors have flown of friction between top brass of the Olympiad and the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games , particularly Billy Payne , that has hindered the program 's development . <p> In a charge echoed by a number of arts leaders , Maxwell Anderson , director of Emory University 's Michael C. Carlos Museum , says ACOG does n't " see culture as a priority . " <p> And while acknowledging that Cultural Olympiad director Jeffrey Babcock has been " working his fingers to the bone , " Woodruff Arts Center President Charles Glassick observes in Dr. Babcock an " inability to make decisions . " He attributes that to a lack of sufficient support from ACOG , which he believes has impeded essential staff growth . <p> An international calendar <p> Sherryl Nelson , director of Clayton State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fitful Olympiad progress , which she says has set back her own planning . <p> " What concerns me is whether the Cultural Olympiad staff is getting the support from ACOG to move ahead on their planning with enough lead time to work on an international calendar , " Mrs. Nelson says . " The top artists in the world make contractual commitments so far ahead . We should have all the funding support and endorsements in place now . " <p> Acknowledging she 's concerned about arts leaders ' perceptions , ACOG 's managing director of Olympic programs , Linda Stephenson , says those doubts should be put to rest when the master plan is unveiled in July . <p> " When you want to be inclusive and bring so many people into the planning process , it does take time , " she says of compiling the plan , which is undergoing final revisions by Olympiad staff before being presented to its nine advisory subcommittees and ACOG leaders . " But I 'd be happy to acknowledge that it is time for us to get the master plan out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Stephenson , says the master plan should give arts groups " a fairly solid idea of how they fit in . " <p> He says the plan will be more specific about the years leading up to the Centennial Games - detailing some of the artists and exhibits headed here - than it will about the summer of ' 96 , when the Olympiad will mount a multiweek Olympic Arts Festival . ( Those details should be announced by next January , he says . ) Though no contracts with artists have been let for events beyond the Mexican celebration being planned for this fall , Dr. Babcock says the Olympiad has " reserved time on calendars . " <p> Dreaming big dreams <p> Mrs. Stephenson also claims that ACOG 's financial and moral support for the Cultural Olympiad has been strong " from its inception . " She points out that it was the Olympic committee 's idea to turn the program into a $ 30 million , four-year celebration . <p> Of course , that was when Atlanta 's Olympic dreamers could afford to dream big dreams . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of city leaders - has been another matter . With corporate sponsorship deals moving haltingly last year , ACOG slowed hiring . The timing was horrible for the nine-member Olympiad staff , which was gearing up for " Winterland " while trying to make long-range plans , many arts leaders felt . <p> Particularly hard hit was the Olympiad 's visual arts planning , since there was no producer to work with the museums , galleries and individual artists . Annette Carlozzi was finally hired last month and begins work in July . While Mrs. Stephenson acknowledges that " not having a visual arts producer on board does make it difficult to plan a program , " neither she nor Dr. Babcock believes the program has been set back . <p> But members of the visual arts advisory panel are n't so sure . The subcommittee has n't met since February , and Kate Fetterolf of the Individual Visual Arts Committee says there 's been " no feedback , no minutes , no nothing " since . " It makes you feel you 've been given a job to do and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know exactly what the job 's definition is , " she says . <p> Without the producer on board , firm visual arts commitments from the Olympiad have been hard to come by . <p> Officials of International Sculpture Exposition/Atlanta discovered as much last month when they announced that ACOG was teaming up with them in a multi-year program to place monumental contemporary sculptures around Atlanta . However , just before the unveiling of the first sculpture , English artist Anthony Caro 's " Northern Drift , " organizers were informed that the Olympiad 's commitment would be only for that work - at least until Ms. Carlozzi was on board to review the project . <p> Even as major a player as the High Museum of Art has been stymied by the uncertainty . An announcement was expected this spring of a reportedly ambitious exhibit the High plans to mount in conjunction with the ' 96 Games . But without a final agreement from ACOG , the High - which would like to avoid a repeat of last year 's embarrassing cancellation of a retrospective by Dutch artist Gerrit Dou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publicity and fund raising . <p> Museum director Ned Rifkin declined comment , but it 's no secret that the Olympiad sanction would make any program more appealing to potential corporate and foundation sponors . <p> ' We all want to participate ' <p> Says Nexus Contemporary Art Center Executive Director Louise Shaw : " We visual arts institutions obviously have to move ahead with our programming , though it is not as critical with Nexus as it is with the High , which must plan three or four years in advance . <p> " Part of the anxiety is that we all want to participate , " Ms. Shaw says . " But it 's just as important for those who will not be participating officially to know that , so they can begin working on fringe events . " <p> Not everyone in the arts community is as anxious . <p> Fulton County Commission Chairman Michael Lomax , who last year was extremely critical of the Cultural Olympiad 's operations , believes Olympic officials are being more responsive . <p> " We must realize they ca n't be all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If we want things to happen , we have to make them happen . " <p> Adds Rick Beard , executive director of the Atlanta History Center : " My take on it is that everyone in the cultural community had unrealistic expectations in the beginning and were looking to the Cultural Olympiad to solve any number of problems outside of its scope . And Jeff came in looking for an infrastructure that probably does n't exist , and he was besieged and knocked around , undeservedly so . " <p> On the job since August 1991 , Dr. Babcock says if anything he expected it would take longer to settle the master plan - in large part because the Olympiad worked with local organizations . " The collaborative nature of the process . . . requires that ideas evolve over a period of time , " he says . <p> The anxiety , he says , is " part of the process ; it 's to be expected . " In the end , he believes Atlanta 's arts community will be satisfied . " Our effort is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've made that commitment , and we have n't wavered one bit from that . " <p> Still , many in the cultural community are restless . <p> " I think we all realize we 'd like to be further along than we are , " says Terry Maple , executive director of Zoo Atlanta . " It 's probably going to be a real sprint , and that 's probably true of everything surrounding the Olympics . If you ask me , we 're at the point where it 's time to sprint .
