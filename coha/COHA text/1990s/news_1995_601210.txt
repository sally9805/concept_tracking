<p> Commerce Secretary Ron Brown is the ultimate deal-maker , one of the most effective in the Clinton Cabinet , a man who delivers on promises . <p> Now , those same talents are causing him trouble . An independent counsel has been named to investigate Brown 's financial dealings . The focus is on a pre-government deal seemingly too good to be true - a nice profit with little investment . <p> As if that were not enough , Congress has targeted the Commerce Department for elimination , not because of Brown , but because critics consider it a bloated bureaucracy . <p> While the disputes rage , Brown says he 's forging ahead . " I have n't missed a single step , " he says . <p> The irony of Brown 's talent has not been lost on observers . <p> " He 's a natural-born wheeler-dealer , " says Claude Barfield , director of trade policy at Washington 's American Enterprise Institute . " The positive side is that it benefits American companies . The negative side is the consequences of his doing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says questions about his integrity are political . <p> " I 'm confident when the inquiry is complete it will be found that there 's been no impropriety , no wrongdoing on my part whatsoever - which is what I 've said from the beginning , " he says . <p> The maestro who coordinated the 1992 convention that brought Bill Clinton to the national stage has transferred his choreographic skills to international trade policy . <p> In the process , he has brought home millions of dollars in business for U.S. firms , and made good on President Clinton 's pledge to make international business the heart of his foreign policy . <p> Brown 's success is rooted in an uncanny ability to deal with a variety of people in a variety of settings . <p> Last February , for example , he headed a delegation of American business executives seeking business in the Middle East . The topic in Jerusalem : $ 500 million in high-tech deals with Israeli entrepreneurs . <p> Without skipping a beat , the group moved to another world - the dusty West Bank town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal ear to struggling Palestinians looking for $ 50,000 loans . <p> James Zogby , director of the Washington-based Arab American Institute , one of those on the trip , was struck by Brown 's comfort level with people of all races and all economic groups , in all settings . <p> " We 'll call it charisma , " Zogby says . " When you 're with him , you know he 's with you . He 's right there . " <p> Call him an entrepreneurial matchmaker or an economic ambassador . Brown has helped U.S. businesses win deals in Russia , China , India , South Africa , Latin America and Europe that could eventually be worth more than $ 20 billion . <p> " I do n't think he sleeps , " says Michael Armstrong , a Republican and chairman of Hughes Aircraft . " He 's probably the most effective secretary of commerce in the international arena this country has enjoyed - ever . He does n't just talk the game , he plays it . " <p> In Russia last year , Brown made sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin . And he had them sit down with top economic advisers to President Boris Yeltsin for a frank discussion of the problems Americans have when doing business in Russia . <p> In China last summer , his delegation saw President Li Peng . In South Africa , there were meetings with President Nelson Mandela . <p> Rarely known to waste a minute , he devotes travel time to quizzing executives about what they have to offer and what projects they 're seeking . <p> By the time he landed in India on a mission last January , Brown was ready to introduce each of 25 CEOs by name , company and project to Prime Minister P.V . Narasimha Rao . <p> Busy executives appreciate Brown 's efficiency . On his trips , snafus are rare . Events start and begin on time . Buses and vans are where they 're supposed to be , when they 're supposed to be , to get the delegation to its next appointment . In an administration led by a president known for being late to everything , Brown and his staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeping tight schedules . <p> But some Brown watchers are less than charmed by the smooth approach to business . <p> Human rights activists bristle at the memory of Brown 's trips to China and India - where political dissent and religious freedom are not well tolerated - and at his planned visit to Turkey , where human rights are fragile . <p> Critics see Brown 's blurring of politics and economics as troubling : " I do n't like idea of our secretary of commerce spending most of his time acting as a traveling salesman , " says analyst Ed Hudgins of the libertarian CATO Institute . <p> And Rep. Dick Chrysler , R-Mich. , who heads the House task force aiming to dissolve Commerce , says he has a problem with Brown 's foreign trips : " It 's government picking winners and losers . The government should not be in that business . " <p> More , some critics say his trips wrap ribbons around already-cooked business deals that sometimes benefit political allies and would succeed with or without the imprimatur of his official status . <p> Brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style , his department . <p> " Its ' easy to do things during good times , " he says . " The test is can you do them during difficult times . And I think I 've passed that test . " Contributing : Becky Beyers <p> Commerce Secretary Ron Brown is about to face another challenge . A bill to eliminate his department is due to be introduced today in Congress . At least 60 House Republicans will join the effort , led by Rep. Dick Chrysler , R-Mich . <p> The bill would dismantle Commerce within three years , saving taxpayers $ 8 billion over five years , Chrysler says . <p> Brown says the proposal is " tantamount to unilateral disarmament in the battle for global competitiveness . " <p> Republicans say the agency 's $ 4.2 billion annual budget and 37,000 employees are wasteful . <p> The bill would abolish six programs . The rest would transfer to other agencies or go private . <p> Brown 's dealmaking skills will be tested . As these stories show , his skills are formidable . - Beth Belton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commerce Secretary Ron Brown , whose father managed an upscale hotel in New York City 's Harlem section , across from the famed Apollo Theatre , has always been comfortable walking in more than one world . <p> Friends and foes alike agree Brown , 53 , can talk with anyone and fit in anywhere . A key reason he feels so at ease might be his childhood . <p> Growing up during Harlem 's heyday , Brown watched celebrities fill the Theresa Hotel 's lobby with glamour and energy - such performers as Billie Holiday , Count Basie , Duke Ellington and Billy Eckstine . <p> It is an education that served him as he scaled the worlds of Middlebury College and St. John 's Law School . His progress through Washington law firms was capped in 1992 with his successful management of a Democratic National Committee that catapulted a Democrat into the Oval Office for the first time in 12 years . <p> Now , with his personal history and finances under fire , Brown says his record is his strongest defense : <p> " I have proven my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it done under adverse circumstances , " he said in a rare interview about the controversy surrounding him . <p> Deputy Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky calls Brown " very , very smart . He understands what business needs , and he understands , looking at other countries , what changes need to be made to get U.S. business where it should be in those countries . " - Marilyn Greene
