WHAT WITH STEVE FORBES AND ROSS Perot , a lot has been said lately about rich men crowding into presidential politics . But that misses half the story . An unsuccessful run for the White House is a matchless opportunity to acquire wealth , not just flaunt it . In war it may still be the victors who get the spoils . In presidential politics , losing pays better . Whoever wins in November can look forward to a $200,000 annual salary , a White House ringed with tank barriers and a Camp David getaway that 's been described as " a medium-quality boys ' camp without the horses . " The also-rans are in the fast lane to Candy Land . <P> First the speaking fees . Robert Barnett is the contract negotiator for vice-presidential losers Geraldine Ferraro and Dan Quayle and First Lady coulda-been Kitty Dukakis . In his calculation , an articulate candidate who departs the field with an honorable discharge  --  no scandals , a statistically detectable base of voter support  --  " can do five or six speeches a month , at fees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year at a minimum . " Arithmetic : $600,000 to $2.1 million in the first year . <P> Books ? Publishing insiders say a high-profile candidate could command an advance of $300,000 and more . What 's a high-profile candidate ? One with controversial positions and some success among angry voters . Publisher Judith Regan , whose celebrity authors include Rush Limbaugh , Howard Stern and O.J. prosecutor Chris Darden , sums up the field , " When I look at Lamar Alexander , I do n't say , ' Aaah , book . ' When I look at Steve Forbes and Pat Buchanan , I say , ' Aaaah , book . ' " <P> But not just any book . Publishing sources say that a few years ago , Buchanan attempted to shop around a weighty manuscript on his 1992 campaign . No takers . A dutiful account of a short-lived presidential bid did n't look like a good bet . Buchanan might do better this time , says a prominent editor , if he offered a book on " how Dole and the Establishment tried to force him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big-three cash streams is broadcasting . In his last 13 months on Crossfire , Buchanan made $367,350 . When his campaign is over , says cnn spokesman Steve Haworth , " we very much hope to have him back . " No doubt they do , but Pitchfork Pat 's higher name recognition should make his fees negotiable . He could also take a second crack at radio . Hugh Rodham , formerly a Florida Senate candidate and still the brother of the First Lady , launched a show of his own in December that 's already on 43 stations . Buchanan 's talk show last year was picked up by more than 100 stations , enough for a $232,000 payday . A realistic goal now would be to overtake the 125 that carry defeated Senate candidate and radio talker Oliver North . Impassioned also-ran Alan Keyes , who used to host a talk show heard in 10 markets , could also return to the mike .
