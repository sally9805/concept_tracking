YOU COULD ARGUE THAT AS A WAY TO BRIGHTEN UP A LONG GRAY WINTER , Joan Collins ' suit against Random House was the literary equivalent of the Forbes campaign in Iowa  --  wacky , saturated with money and ultimately embarrassing to all concerned . <P> My wife made that argument . She 's been trying to wean me from total dependence on the Republican presidential campaign as a news diet . Whenever she hears Lamar Alexander say it 's all going to be over by March 12 , she sees me on March 13 wandering around like a zombie , mumbling the planks of Morry Taylor 's platform as part of some kooky mantra . <P> She thought the Collins trial would distract me . Random House was maintaining it should n't have to pay Collins the $1.2 million advance for her novel because her manuscript was subliterate gibberish . Her lawyer , who implied that Random House 's real problem with Collins was that her celebrity had faded since they 'd signed her up , could have summed up his case with one question : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All very juicy , I said , but not compared with the Forbes campaign . Steve Forbes , doing that great comedy-club impression of what would happen if some mad scientist decided to construct a dork robot , turned out to be , when inserted into the Republican presidential campaign , a walking fragmentation bomb . <P> Before you knew it , they all started eye gouging like a bunch of Demo-crats , and Bob Dole arrived in New Hampshire charging that corporate fat cats were getting rich while the working man took a licking . <P> " Apparently Joan Collins discussed the writing process while she was on the stand , " my wife said one morning . True . Arguing that Random House 's response to her manuscript should have been to send over a couple of the gnomes it keeps in the basement to write the books celebrities sign , she described the writing process as " a living amoeba . " <P> Sure , someday when I ca n't seem to get the sentences unsnarled , I might push back from my desk and say wearily , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nucleus surrounded by a flexible outer membrane . " <P> But what is that compared with Dole attacking the capitalists ? A man whose overriding concern always seemed to be keeping the world safe for Archer-Daniels-Midland now talks like a Bolshevik . This is beyond living amoebas . <P> " Strom Thurmond hints that he may run for another term in the Senate , at 93 , " my wife said . <P> But that just made me think of all the ways Lamar Alexander manages to paint Dole as a geezer without using the word old . In TV interviews , he keeps saying , " I have new ideas , and Senator Dole has , er , ah , Washington ideas . " He constantly asks if Dole is the person to lead the country " into the next century . " If Thurmond jumped into the Republican presidential race , which now does n't seem all that farfetched , Alexander could say Strom 's not the man to lead the country into his next century . <P> " Did you see the winner of the Westminster Kennel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperately . She knows I love to watch those little woofers trot around the ring at Madison Square Garden . <P> " I 'll catch up with that later , " I said . " This will all be over on March 12.
