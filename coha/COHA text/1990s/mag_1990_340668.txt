Anyone interested in the doings of the Lolo tribes-people , the Tarahumara Indians , or the Berbers , Bedouins and Bushmen knew just where to look . Likewise , those curious about " The Geographical Distribution of Insanity in the U.S. " ( 1903 ) or " Pelican Profiles " ( 1943 ) , or anyone " In Quest of the World 's Largest Frog " ( 1967 ) , had a handy reference guide . For most of its 102 years , National Geographic has been a colorful coffee-table companion for armchair explorers , roaming the world with rose-colored glasses and bringing back a cheery album of natives at play . But last week the abrupt firing of veteran editor Wilbur Garrett left staffers  --  and readers  --  wondering where the magazine might be headed next . <P> Garrett 's dismissal followed months of hallway rumors , infighting , standoffs , bluffs and clashes between the fiercely independent editor and his predecessor , Gilbert Grosvenor , now president and chairman of the National Geographic Society . Scion of the founding family , Grosvenor follows in the footsteps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world 's largest nonprofit scientific and educational institution . <P> The two men had been friends and colleagues for 35 years , but when Grosvenor took over the society and Garrett took charge of the magazine , they faced off over budget cuts , editorial control and their strategies for holding on to the society 's 10 million members ( please , not subscribers ) . To attract younger readers , Garrett , 59 , wanted National Geographic to embrace the news and shed its reputation as a moss-backed wishbook where adolescent boys once made the acquaintance of bare-breasted women . A photographer and journalist himself , Garrett began publishing stories about the Exxon Valdez , the fall of the Berlin Wall , the effects of acid rain , and life in East Harlem . Despite his innovations , circulation remained flat during Garrett 's tenure , after having almost doubled during the previous ten years . <P> Some speculated that Grosvenor resisted long , analytical stories , preferring National Geographic 's traditional franchise of anthropology , travelogues and scenic montage . Yet it was under his tenure as editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relevance by running stories on Harlem and South Africa and the Quebec separatist movement . More likely , the clash had to do with personalities  --  or money . In recent years the society has branched out into book publishing , a TV program , a travel magazine and a research journal . The strain on cash flow triggered cost cutting and staff reductions , leaving Garrett 's writers and explorers with less luxuriant expense accounts than usual and strict project budgets to meet . Grosvenor favored shorter stories , focusing on the U.S. , in place of the lavish globe-roaming epics of yore . <P> The final blow came when a committee of staffers , ironically formed by Garrett , presented Grosvenor with a report calling for some changes to allow for the advancement of the young and the restless and to improve the management of the magazine . Grosvenor 's reply was to name William P.E . Graves , 63 , to replace Garrett at the top editor 's post , thus seeming to signal a return to more predictable stories and modest aspirations . Said one depressed insider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , and everybody 's just wandering around in a stupor wondering what they 're going to do next . "
