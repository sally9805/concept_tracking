A little more than two hours after coasting to victory in the 130th Travers Stakes at Saratoga last Saturday , Lemon Drop Kid stood quietly at the rear of his stall , staring out the window . Groom Vincente Zapien , knee-deep in straw , whistled and chirped in Spanish as he wrapped the Kid 's legs in bandages . Clearly enjoying the attention , the big bay colt stood still , save for the occasional pricking of his ears , as though the 1 ? miles he 'd just run had been nothing more than a walk around the shedrow. // Just outside , trainer Scotty Schulhofer sat at a picnic table enjoying a victory celebration with a few members of his staff and Lemon Drop Kid 's owners , Jeanne Vance and her husband , Laddie Dance . The 73-year-old Schulhofer marveled at how calmly the Kid had come through such a strenuous test . " It 's like he just had a little workout is all , " Schulhofer said . " Some horses get pretty wound up or a little tired . With him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitely had been more than just a workout , but Lemon Drop Kid had beaten a talented field with little fuss and minimal urging . In the process he proved that his triumph in the Belmont Stakes in June was no accident , and he decisively stamped his name onto the increasingly crowded ballot for the Eclipse Award , given to the year 's best 3-year-old. // Nothing could have seemed more improbable only three months ago . Going into the Belmont  --  as a 30-1 shot  --  the Kid had won only one race since his victory in the Futurity last September , and he 'd finished ninth in the Kentucky Derby in May . Because favored Charismatic broke down in the stretch , Lemon Drop Kid 's surprising win was regarded as little more than a fluke and a footnote to the sad end of another spoiled Triple Crown bid . " It 's a shame about Charismatic , " says Dance , " but he was a beaten horse in the Belmont . " Says Schulhofer , " We did n't worry about it . We knew what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Kid the next two months off , and the colt made the most of the time . He grew into the big , rangy body that Dance and Vance had envisioned when they 'd bought him for $200,000 at Keeneland in September 1997 " He 's much more mature in every way , " says Schulhofer. // In Lemon Drop Kid 's first race after his layoff , Ecton Park beat him by 5 ? lengths in the Jim Dandy at Saratoga on Aug. 8 . Schulhofer was n't worried . Instead , he was encouraged by the Kid 's second-place performance on a sloppy track . " He just does n't like an off track , " Schulhofer explained to anyone who asked last week . " The horse could n't be doing better . " // With Charismatic out of the running , the Travers figured to be a coronation for Menifee , the runner-up in the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness , who had finished on the board in eight of his nine career starts . On Saturday a record crowd of 51,371 sent him off as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice at 7-2 . Menifee did n't run badly , but he was pinned against the rail most of the way and finished a very nonthreatening third . // Instead of coming from off the pace , as he had done at the Belmont , Lemon Drop Kid set up close to the leaders , never trailing by more than three lengths . Running with a long , smooth stride under jockey Jose Santos , Lemon Drop Kid cruised through the first mile before he began to draw away at the top of the stretch . The only horse who went with him was Vision and Verse , whom the Kid had defeated by a head in the Belmont . They dueled stride for stride through most of the last quarter mile . Santos , however , went to the whip only three times before hand riding Lemon Drop Kid home to a ? - length victory . " Around the half-mile pole , I knew it was a sure win , " said Santos . " Shane Sellers aboard Vision and Verse was motivating his horse , and I was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be named top 3-year-old has now become a full cavalry charge likely to be decided at the Breeders ' Cup in November . Charismatic is probably still a favorite among the Eclipse Award voters , and there will be at least one more chance for Menifee to bolster his credentials before the Breeders ' Cup . But if Lemon Drop finishes the year the same way he did on Saturday , he could win the honor . // One other thing working in his favor is the life change he underwent last week . " He 's been a ridgeling , " Dance said after the race , meaning one of the Kid 's testicles had yet to drop . " Wednesday morning he became a colt , and today he knew it . He proved it to everybody . " // He certainly proved it to Schulhofer . " I 've always wanted to win the Travers , " he said . " This is one of the biggest thrills I 've had in racing . He 's the best 3-year-old I 've ever been around . "  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
