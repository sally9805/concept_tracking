<p> New Orleans - It would not have worked with another decathlete . Say , Sheldon Blockburger . Dan and Sheldon ? Does n't quite have a ring to it . Sheldon and Dave ? Wrong . But Dan and Dave ? Perfect . It 's short , it 's simple , it 's alliterative . And it 's an advertising phenomenon that 's made pop stars of two guys named Dan O'Brien and Dave Johnson . <p> Dan and Dave . <p> Who 's the World 's Greatest Athlete ? To be settled in Barcelona , as the Dan and Dave TV commercials suggest . <p> World 's Greatest Athlete is the title bestowed upon the Olympic decathlon champion . It 's also the premise of a $ 25 million advertising campaign by Reebok that has elevated Dan and Dave to first-name-only status . The Olympics are a month away . The decathlon does n't begin until today at the U.S. Olympic Track and Field Trials . Yet already , Dan and Dave are everywhere . <p> On TV , as they have been since the Super @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and buttons . In Las Vegas , where a sports book shop is taking bets on which one will win . Dan and Dave . Pedestrians cry out to them . Drivers stop their cars and shout , " Hey , Dan and Dave ! " Everywhere , always , Dan and Dave . Dave often wears a Dan hat . Soon , he hopes to have a surname , too . <p> " When I win the gold medal at Barcelona , that 's when everybody will know the last names of Dan and Dave , " said Dave . " I 'll be Dave Johnson . And the one who will win the gold medal will be remembered . " <p> One of them will likely win the gold . Dan , 25 , is the 1991 world champion and American record holder . Dave , 29 , is the 1990 Goodwill Games champ and , until O'Brien 's emergence , the best American decathlete since Bruce Jenner in 1976 . But whatever Barcelona brings , both will be remembered , together . Dan and Dave , forever entwined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeking last August , when planning its Olympic-year ad campaign . " Is n't there an image about the world 's greatest athlete ? " said Ford Ennals , then Reebok 's senior vice president for worldwide marketing , now president of its fitness division . " We thought that was a big deal . " <p> Reebok was about to introduce a new cross-training shoe . " And decathletes are the ultimate cross-trainers , " Ennals said of the men who compete in 10 track and field events in two days . So at a day-long meeting , Ennals , advertising vice president Dave Ropes and others weeded out the U.S. decathletes . At day 's end , they had Dan and Dave . <p> " What we did n't know is how they 'd relate to each other , " said Ennals , " if they 'd get along . " <p> They get along famously , and began growing famous immediately after the first commercials were shown during the Super Bowl . " The fact that they 're great-looking , have great physiques , great personalities and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people genuinely like these guys . " <p> Indeed , Dan and Dave are good friends if friendly rivals . They first met at a decathlon training camp in 1989 in Colorado Springs , Colo. , when Dave approached Dan and said , " Hey , I know you 're hurt , but I 've got a feeling you and I are going to be traveling together . " <p> Push began at Super Bowl <p> Both are engaging but not slick , and remarkably comfortable in front of a TV camera . Both have also benefited from the ad campaign itself , developed by Chiat/Day/Mojo , a New York advertising agency . The idea was simple : simplicity . Dan and Dave . With each name printed in a box . <p> Reebok was also seeking something fresh and distinctive , and started its campaign during the Super Bowl while most companies geared theirs to the Trials and Olympics . " Let 's face it , there 's a lot of clutter around the Olympics , " said Ennals . So the ad campaign began by introducing Dan and Dave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except in Olympic years . The first ads showed photos and home movies of them as infants and kids . Introducing Dan and Dave . <p> " The gamble we took was that they were real athletes and could we get them known . They did n't play for the Chicago Bulls or a star football team . But our biggest concern was , would people care ? After the Super Bowl , we said , ' Did people care ? ' And our biggest fear was that we 'd get to Barcelona and everybody 'd say , ' Dan and Dave , who cares ? ' " <p> Even Dan and Dave were skeptical despite signing three-year contracts . When Reebok approached Dave , " I was amazed at first , " he said . " They showed me little cartoons of what they wanted to do . " <p> " They said , ' We 're gon na make you and Dave household names , ' " said Dan . " I said , ' No way . How are you gon na do that ? ' " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series of humorous , eye-catching ads that cast Dan and Dave in their true light : as friendly , funny rivals . Dan and Dave were so good on camera , people called up Reebok wondering who the actors were playing Dan and Dave . Some people even think they 're brothers . <p> " It 's kinda confusing , " said Dave . " We do almost look alike . Some people come up and say , ' How 's your brother gon na do ? ' " <p> There are other striking similarities . Both were wayward once , but found redemption in the decathlon . As a teenager in Missoula , Mont. , Dave was a bowler , baseball player and troublemaker . " The most trouble was finding the keys to a beer distributor , a warehouse , and helping myself , " said Dave , who hung with a group called The Old West Side Gang . They drank beer each weekend until the locks were changed and they were arrested . <p> Fortunately , his family moved to Corvallis , Ore. , and he found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I was born and raised in L.A. , " he said , " I 'd be right in the middle of it with gangs . " <p> Dan was adopted at age 2 by a couple in Klamath Falls , Ore . His natural father was African-American and his mother Finnish , both college students then . He is one of six adopted children who are Korean , Hispanic and bi-racial . <p> Dan 's ups and downs <p> In college at Idaho , Dan drank too much . He had a regular weekly bar schedule : " On Mondays , it was Bogart 's , Tuesdays it was Mort 's . . . " His grades slipped . He lost his athletic scholarship and had to drop out . <p> On Christmas morning 1987 , Dan woke up and wondered , " Hey , this is n't the way I want to be . " He was alone in the house he shared with three other guys . They 'd all gone home for the holidays . He was out of school , out of work , out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't go home for Christmas . <p> " It was a pride thing , " he said . " I did n't want to go home and face all the questions : ' How 's it going ? Why are n't you in school ? ' " <p> In February , Dan enrolled in a junior college , got his grades up and was accepted back into Idaho . He recommitted himself to training for the decathlon , but was still drinking beer . Not now . <p> " The occasional drink came to the occasional stop a couple of months ago , " Dan said . It was for his health and training as well as for his image . <p> Earlier this year , Dan had a stress fracture in his right fibula . He lost some training time , and the injury could be aggravated by the pounding he 'll take in the next two days . But Dan says he 's not concerned . Surprisingly , neither was Reebok at the prospect of losing Dan for Barcelona . <p> Gold-medal ads ready <p> The campaign is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we got for our investment , " said Ennals . Sales are so brisk , retailers ca n't keep the cross-training shoe in stock . Whatever happens in Barcelona , even if Dan or Dave do n't get there or one does n't win a medal , Reebok is prepared . <p> The contingency plan involves the last batch of the 15 commercials , which have already been shot . They include one with Dan winning the gold , one with Dave winning . The appropriate spot will be aired on TV immediately after the 1,500 meters , the decathlon 's last event , is run . Then the campaign will expand worldwide , and continue through the ' 96 Olympics in Atlanta . <p> " Dan and Dave will come out of the Olympics as the biggest heroes , " Ennals predicted . <p> Until then , Dan and Dave are enjoying their fame , yet trying to temper it . " With the commercial , you feel more like you 're a Hollywood kind of guy , " said Dave . " I 've just had to put it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " It 's been hard for me to look in the mirror and say , ' Gosh , you 're a star , ' " said Dan . " I wake up each morning and eat Life cereal , same as the guy next door . " <p> Nope . He 's now Dan . Of Dan and Dave . To be settled in Barcelona .
