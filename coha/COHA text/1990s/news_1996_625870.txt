<p> Do n't worry , because if Jason Kidd is any example , the future of the game is in good hands . <p> Kidd can play this game . <p> Unlike many of the Generation Xers the NBA tries to foist upon the public today , the second-year guard for the Dallas Mavericks is one of the new breed that has actually earned what he receives , both in dollars and publicity . <p> No , Kidd , 22 , is not one of the young knuckleheads in the league - kids with plenty of dollars in the bank and inches in their vertical jumps , but absolutely clueless when it comes to the game itself . <p> Indeed , in the how-high-is-up world of the NBA these days , Kidd is an anomaly - an honest-to-goodness passer who would much rather set up a teammate than score himself . Kidd does n't get over the rim much but is definitely an over-the-top performer with his ability to see the floor the same way Magic Johnson sees the floor . Or the way John Stockton sees the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Yes , Jason Kidd is that type of player . <p> Where the triple-double was once the domain of Johnson and Robertson , Kidd is the new master of that statistical measure of all-around ability . Has anyone in Houston forgotten the 38-point , 11-rebound , 10-assist game Kidd had in a 156-147 double-overtime victory over the Rockets on April 11 last year - a game that included eight 3-pointers ? <p> The 6-4 point guard has amassed five triple-doubles already this season and averaged a triple-double - 27.7 points , 10.7 rebounds and 10.7 assists , adding 3.3 steals for good measure - to be named NBA Player of the Week for the period ending Feb. 4 . Now if only the Mavericks could start winning a few more games . <p> The new , but still not improved Mavericks come to The Summit tonight to face the Rockets to kick off the second half of what has been a most disappointing season . Big things were expected of the Mavericks this season , who entered the All-Star break just 16-30 . <p> " " We 're like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kidd , the NBA 's co-Rookie of the Year last season with Detroit 's Grant Hill . <p> " " I think that 's maturity . I 'm not talking man-wise . I 'm talking about basketball-wise . If you look at a Utah team that has players who have been in the league for 10 or 11 years , that has the combo of John Stockton and Karl Malone , they know the game . " <p> Speaking of Utah , Kidd closed the first half by racking up a team-record 25 assists in a 136-133 double-overtime victory over Stockton and the Jazz last Thursday . But as usual , Kidd was trying to deflect the praise in the wake of his huge game . <p> " " It 's kind of funny to be talking about feeling good passing the ball , " he said . " " Everybody talks about being in the zone shooting the ball and playing the perfect game . ( The Utah game ) was one of those rare instances where I was in the zone passing the ball and my teammates were converting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his teammates ) have the hardest job - they have to catch the ball and they have to finish . If they do n't make the baskets , I do n't get the assists , nor do I get the recognition I get for passing the ball . " <p> And he 's getting plenty of recognition , even from Seattle coach George Karl , who originally blasted the selection of Kidd an an All-Star Game starter over Stockton and the Sonics ' Gary Payton . It was n't long afterward that Kidd hammered the Sonics with 36 points , nine rebounds and eight assists in a 103-100 Dallas victory . <p> " " I love how he can handle and penetrate with the ball , " Karl recently said . " " I think any player that makes the game simple has a chance to be a great player , and Jason Kidd is a very simple basketball player . He can push the ball , he passes the ball extremely well , he has great defensive hands and he understands defensive concepts . <p> " " He is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talents . He makes the game simple for a lot of people . " <p> Like his teammates , who have been feeding off Kidd 's passing to remain at least competitive despite the loss of forward Jamal Mashburn , who is out for the season after deciding to undergo surgery on the knee he injured Dec. 12 . <p> " " It 's a big piece of the puzzle that we were counting on coming back , " Kidd said . " " You 're talking about a guy who averaged 25 points and on any given night can give you 40 . <p> That 's something we needed on this team because we do n't have that explosiveness where somebody can give you 40 . But Jimmy ( Jackson ) showed us ( against the Jazz ) that he 's capable of doing that . <p> " " Hopefully , he can be more consistent with that and from there , the future is bright . George McCloud has stepped in and has done almost the same job Jamal was doing when he was playing . " <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his 18 games this season after scoring 24.1 last year , means Kidd has had to step up his game , averaging 19.3 points , 11.2 assists and 8.1 rebounds in January . <p> " " Jason is telling everybody that he 's still got a long way to go and a lot more to learn , " said Dallas forward Popeye Jones . <p> " " That 's going to be a scary five years down the road . It 's already phenomenal how well he knows the game and the things he can do on the court . " <p> Like the 21-point , 16-rebound , 16-assist number Kidd dropped on the Los Angeles Clippers on Jan. 30 , the first 20-15-15 game in the league since Magic Johnson did it in 1989 . <p> Make no mistake about it , this is Kidd 's team . Not Jackson 's , the phenom of three years ago . Not Mashburn 's , the hotshot from two years ago . Not that they lack the talent , but it 's Kidd 's team , a fact that was etched in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All-Star Game Sunday . <p> " " It 's a great challenge to be known as a good player in this league , " he said . " " I know I have a long way to go , though . I 'm still young and I still have a lot to learn . A great example I always look up to is John Stockton - a guy who comes off the bench behind Ricky Green , a guy who 's been sitting on the bench for two years and now he 's the premier point guard in the league . <p> " " Now that Magic 's back - you guys ( the media ) call him a point forward , but everyone knows he 's a point guard - they 're probably the two premier point guards in this league . " <p> Kidd played just 22 minutes ( compared to Payton 's 28 ) , scoring seven points and dishing out a game-high 10 assists , but the numbers were secondary to the experience , he said . <p> " " I hope this adds confidence , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spill over to my teammates . This is a great situation . You 're talking about Dream Team members and some of the best to ever play the game with Michael ( Jordan ) , John Stockton and Charles Barkley . This is the perfect opportunity for me to absorb all the information they can give . " <p> While Kidd is focusing on the task ahead for the Mavericks , he would like to add one more highlight to his basketball resume - a spot on the 1996 Olympic Dream Team . Two spots are still open and Kidd had a couple of suggestions to fill those slots . <p> " " Nominations ? I 'd hate to be selfish and pick myself , but I 'm going to have to be selfish , " Kidd said . " " Me and ( Seattle 's ) Shawn Kemp . Those are two that I would pick , but I 'm not on the committee so I do n't think my vote counts . Grant Hill is my campaign manager , so talk to him and see how it 's going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about me shooting the ball . They have plenty of scorers . They have John Stockton and I would n't mind picking up John 's sweatpants off the floor and fold it up . I would n't have to play a lot of minutes . I think it 's just the experience of representing the country . That 's something I always dreamed about . <p> " " I had a chance when they put the elite 12 together when they had the Dream Team ( in 1992 ) . They had a college Dream Team and I was the youngest one on that team ( before his freshman year at Cal ) and it was a great honor to put on a USA jersey . "
