Rick had been searching for the Pillings ' address for over twenty minutes , and the hungrier he became , the harder it was to concentrate on the dimly lit street signs , the six-digit numbers stenciled on curbs . Westgate Village was a planned community an hour away from the downtown loft where Rick lived , and its street names were an endless rearrangement of the same bucolic phrase : Valley Vista Circle , Village Road , Valley View Court . Each one-story ranch house looked nearly the same except for the color of its garage door , and Rick , who 'd skipped lunch , began to wonder if the entire suburb was a hunger-induced hallucination . Jerry Pilling , giddy as a kid at the prospect of throwing a party , had given Rick hasty directions over the phone so many weeks ago that Rick now had a hard time deciphering his own scrawl . He pulled over to the curb , squinted at what he 'd written on a scrap of paper , and tried to retrace his turns . All the while , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ache came and went . <p> Rick was about to give up and head for a phone booth when a Mustang crept past , the driver peering this way and that , on the prowl for an address . Jerry had described the party as a chance for his wife , Meg , to meet a group of his gay friends , and after much wrangling she 'd finally agreed , but only on the condition that she could invite her hairdresser , the one " avowed " homosexual she knew . Rick had a hunch that the man driving the Mustang was Mrs. Pilling 's hairdresser  --  the skin of his face was shiny and taut , his silver hair moussed  --  and decided to follow him . " Avowed " had about it a quaint , anachronistic ring , and Rick pictured a dandy in an ascot , hand raised as he swore some sort of oath . Sure enough , the Mustang pulled up to the right address within minutes . A house with double doors and deep eaves , it sat at the end of a cul-de-sac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front lawn glowing greenly in the dusk . <p> Rick had met Jerry Pilling on a midnight flight from New York to Los Angeles . Returning home from his one-man show at a SoHo gallery , Rick was solvent and optimistic for the first time in a year . Seatmates in the back of the plane , the two of them struck up a conversation , or rather , Rick listened across the dark heartlands of America as tiny bottles of Smirnoffs accumulated on Jerry 's tray table . " Meg and I are Mormons , " Jerry told him , shaking the last drops of alcohol into his plastic tumbler , " so we are n't allowed to drink . But I bend the rules depending on the altitude . " He touched Rick 's arm , and his breath , as pungent as jet fuel , sterilized the air between them . " I 'm terrified of flying . " This was the first of Jerry 's confessions ; soon they came with escalating candor , the consonants softened by booze . " Do you know any Mormons ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Only impersonally " laughed Rick . <p> " Well , take it from me , not all of us are polygamists who bathe in our holy undergarments . There 's lots of ways to be a Mormon ; at least , that 's the way I see it . " <p> " There 's a Mormon guy at my gym " ventured Rick , " who wears the garments under his workout clothes , even in summer . " <p> " Or proselytize on our bicycles . " <p> " I 'm sorry ? " <p> " Not all of us proselytize on our bicycles . " <p> Rick pictured Jerry listing from a Schwinn . <p> " Listen , " said Jerry , giving Rick a **37;1050;TOOLONG look . " Are you by any chance ... I do n't mean to be presumptuous , so forgive me if I 'm wrong , but you have n't said anything about a wife , and I was wondering if you 're ... " <p> " Gay ? " <p> " I knew it ! " blurted Jerry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  sixth sense  --  about these things . I am , too ! " <p> To Rick 's way of thinking , Jerry was unduly excited by this coincidence , as if he 'd discovered they shared the same mother . Still , he found something ingenuous about the portly , balding stranger beside him . He eyed Jerry 's wedding ring , and with no prompting whatsoever , Jerry launched into the story of his marriage . " I only recently told Meg that I fooled around with men in college . Groping a house-brother , that sort of thing . " This piqued Rick 's interest , and he had to steer Jerry back to the subject when , trying to recall the name of his fraternity , he was side-tracked into a muddled pronunciation of Greek letters . " The point , " continued Jerry , " is that I wanted to write off my college flings as trial and error , youthful confusion . But after six children and twenty years of marriage , I could n't ignore my thing for guys . College men especially . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sighed . " The more I tried to pray it away , the stronger it got . " <p> The plane hit a patch of turbulence over Kansas . Snug in his seat and buffered by vodka , Jerry did n't seem to notice . A few passengers shifted beneath their blankets . A baby bawled in the forward cabin . " We counseled with the church elders , Meg and me , and they thought that male companionship  --  strictly platonic , of course  --  would help me scratch the itch , " as they put it . So we decided to stay married and faithful , and I 'm going to make some homosexual friends . " Jerry brightened . " We 'll have to have you over for dinner . " <p> " The church wants you to have gay friends ? " <p> " Hey " said Jerry , shifting in his seat . " They did n't say homosexual or not . But male companionship ' is open to interpretation , do n't you think ? " He stirred his drink with an index finger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ According to the church , if me and Meg get divorced , old Jerry here wanders around heaven for time immemorial , a soul without a family . " <p> It was delicate : Rick did n't want to mock Jerry 's religious beliefs , but he found this punishment cruel and unusual . Not to mention superstitious . " Do you really believe that 's what would happen ? " <p> " The idea scares me whether I believe in it or not . An outcast even after I 'm dead . Lifelong bonds coming to nothing . Estranged from my very own kids " He chewed an ice cube and shivered . " I joined Affirmation , a group of gay Mormons , and they say the church is run by humans , and humans do n't know everything there is to know about the Creator 's plan ; only one judgment matters in the end , and at least He 'll know what made me tick and how I tried to do what 's right . But Rick " said Jerry , leaning close , " here 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're skeptical about a man staying married . " <p> " You mean , about a gay man staying married ? " <p> " Is n't that what I said ? Anyway , living in a family makes me happy . My kids are turning into people I like , and the little ones shriek and swamp me every time I walk through the door . Chalk it up to my having been an only child , but even when they 're fighting and crying , the chaos is kind of cozy , you know ? " <p> " What about your wife ? " <p> " I 'd tried to tell her when we were dating , but she 'd shush me and say the past did n't matter . It probably did n't occur to her I was messing with men . She wanted a husband , and I wanted to be normal ; in that respect we were meant for each other . And here I am . " Jerry looked around , then whispered , " I 'm the only man Meg has ever slept with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never pretended . I 've always loved her , and I always will . In the bedroom , too . Love must count for something , right ? " The seat belt signs were turned off , and a low electronic bell rang throughout the cabin . " Sorry if I talked your ear off " said Jerry . " I should really keep my big mouth shut . But keeping quiet wears me out a lot more than talking . " His head lolled toward the oval window . Rick leaned forward and gazed out , too . Beads of condensation gathered on the glass . Below them , as far as the eye could see , dawn tinted the rim of the earth ; roads and rooftops and plowed fields  --  tiny hints of human habitation  --  were just becoming visible through thin , drifting layers of clouds . <p> The double doors swung open , and there stood Mrs. Pilling . Her tight auburn curls were a miracle of modern cosmetology , their true color and texture unguessable . She glanced back and forth between Rick and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come together ? " she asked . Perhaps she assumed that Rick and Oscar had crossed paths in the small province of their " lifestyle . " Rick felt a pang of sympathy for Meg . She 's trying to hold up the walls , he thought , just like the rest of us . Dressed in slinky blue culottes , eyelids dusted with matching shadow , Meg appeared every inch the camera-ready hostess ; the only thing missing , lamented Rick , was a platter of canapes . He felt certain her stylish outfit was meant to show her husband 's unconventional friends that she was a woman with flair , not the stodgy , narrow-minded matron they might have expected . <p> " It 's serendipity , " Oscar told her , handing over a bouquet laced with baby 's breath . " We met tonight on this very doorstep . " <p> " Oscar treats me like a queen " said Meg , plunging her powdered nose into the flowers . <p> Jerry Pilling darted out the door . " Gentlemen , " he bellowed , " welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handshake were far more manly than Rick remembered . Dressed in loose black linen , Oscar rippled as Jerry pumped his hand . " Meg 's raved about you , " he told Oscar . " Says you 're the only man who can give her hair volume " <p> " Noblesse oblige , " said Oscar . He turned toward Mrs. Pilling . " Meg , dear , you 'd better get that nosegay into some water . " <p> Rick and Oscar followed the Pillings into a spacious living room , as ornate , thought Rick , as a rococo salon . Overstuffed sofas and chairs were piled with tasseled pillows . Stripes and plaids and herringbones collided , vying for attention . One wall was an archive of framed family photographs . Jerry and Meg pointed to the pictures and boasted about their kids in unison  --  a long , overlapping roll call  --  and it sounded to Rick like they 'd given birth to a happy hive , several more than the half-dozen children Jerry mentioned on the plane . Snapshots in which the whole family posed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagined the Pillings ' grocery cart loaded to the brim with potato chip bags , Cheerios boxes as big as luggage , six-packs of soda , gallons of milk . While the Pillings , as verbose as docents , led him along the wall , Rick searched every tabletop for a bowl of peanuts or a wedge of cheese , finding instead an endless array of ceramic animals , dried flowers , and colorful blown-glass clowns . The clowns looked as though they were molded out of hard candy , and Rick could almost taste their antic faces . <p> " Where is your brood ? " asked Oscar . <p> " Simon 's at debating . Mandy 's at ballet . The rest of the kids have already eaten . They 're in their rooms doing who knows what . " Jerry nodded toward a hallway that burrowed deep into one wing of the house . Light seeped from beneath its row of doors . <p> " I 'll check on the kids , " said Meg . <p> " How ' bout I show you the grounds , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The yard was a vast expanse of concrete with a kidney-shaped swimming pool in the center . Lit from within , the pool threw woozy refractions onto the surrounding cinder-block walls . Pool toys bobbed atop the water like flotsam from a shipwreck . An inflatable shark , bleached by the sun , floated belly-up . Jerry bent down at the edge of the pool and fiddled with the water filter , which made a shrill sucking noise ; from behind , it looked as if he were trying to drink the pool through a straw . Blood sugar plummeting , Rick wondered if it would be impolite to ask for a Coke , or whether he should wait until something was offered . He scolded himself for being a recluse ; if he got out of the studio more often , he might know how to behave in these situations . <p> The sliding glass doors rumbled open , and Meg ushered the remaining guests into the warm night . Mitchell Coply was Jerry 's dentist . A man in his early forties , he had the slim , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprang onto his forehead no matter how often he brushed it away . His puckish appearance was contradicted by tired , melancholy eyes behind his gold-rimmed glasses . During the round of introductions , Mitchell was soft-spoken and shy about eye contact , the kind of man incapable of concealing his sadness . Jan Kirby was an agent who worked with Jerry at a real estate office that specialized in new housing developments throughout the San Fernando Valley . Tall and broad-shouldered , Jan wore a pinstriped pants suit and running shoes . After meeting the other guests , she stood perilously close to the edge of the pool and faced the deep end , hands on her hips . Lit from below by the pool light , she looked to Rick like a deity about to part , or walk across , the water . " After dessert , " she said in her husky voice , " let 's go skinny-dipping . " It took everyone a second to realize she was joking . Mrs. Pilling wagged a finger at Jan  --  naughty , naughty  --  and gave a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guests reassembled indoors to see the Pillings ' remodeled kitchen , Rick was actively praying for snack food . The thought of salty pretzels possessed him , though he 'd have happily settled for Triscuits , Cheese Nips , anything with weight and flavor . Meg Pilling ran her manicured hand across the width of a new refrigerator , like one of those models who stroke appliances on game shows . The built-in ice maker suddenly dumped a few chiming ice cubes into a tumbler . Mitchell nodded thoughtfully . Oscar applauded and said , " Brava ! " Jan asked if the refrigerator could heel or play dead . Only after the demonstration did Rick notice the absence of cooking odors . The windows of the double-ovens were dark , the granite countertops barren . Copper pots hung above the electric range in descending size , mere decoration . Rick tried to fight his hangdog expression ; had n't Jerry said there 'd be dinner ? <p> " Folks " announced Jerry , after corralling everyone into the living room , " have a seat . The wife and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an avalanche of tasseled pillows and sank , side by side , into the plaid couch . " Honey , " Jerry said to Meg , " you 've got the floor . " <p> Meg Pilling walked to the center of the room and faced the couch , hands clasped before her . She taught at Westgate Elementary , which explained her exemplary posture and the lilting , patient cadence of her voice . Rick had no trouble envisioning a troupe of mesmerized second-graders following her every order . He wondered if she was about to ask them to make their dinner out of paste and construction paper . <p> Meg cleared her throat and gazed into the upturned faces of her guests . " Jerry and I wanted to do something fun and unusual , so we 've planned a really outlandish night " She grinned and shot a look at her husband . Jerry beamed back . " I bet you 're all just itching to know what it is . " As if on cue , everyone suddenly nodded and mumbled and shifted about . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " we 're going to give you each five dollars and let you go to the store on your own  --  there are several excellent supermarkets in the area  --  so you can buy something to fix for a potluck ! " <p> No one stirred or spoke . Rick was n't sure he 'd heard her correctly . <p> " We have all the cooking utensils you 'll need , " said Meg . " And that brand-new kitchen is just sitting there , waiting ! The only rules are that you do n't go over your five-dollar limit , and that you 're back here within half an hour . " <p> " Do we have to actually cook what we buy ? " asked Mitchell . The idea of culinary effort seemed to depress him . " Ca n't we buy something frozen or from the deli section ? " <p> Meg 's smile wavered . Through the crack in her composure , Rick thought he glimpsed a hint of misery . " Now , that would n't be very creative , would it ? " She looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to prod some people into the party spirit . <p> " I get it " rasped Jan . " Hunters and gatherers ! " <p> " How primitive , " said Oscar . <p> " I used to love scavenger hunts , " said Mitchell . " Of course , those were the days when a kid could knock on a stranger 's door without being molested or kidnapped . " He pushed his glasses up the bridge of his nose . <p> " Well , " said Meg , reviving her smile , " you 're safe in Westgate . " <p> " She 's absolutely right , " said Jerry . " If you 're not back in half an hour , we 'll file a report with the Bureau of Missing Persons . " He removed a wallet from his back pocket and dealt out five-dollar bills . Peering up from a sitting position , reaching out for what amounted to his allowance , Rick had to admit that , fiscally speaking , Jerry fit the paternal role , confident and ceremonious as he handled money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his five and winked at Rick . <p> " I ironed them , " said Meg , to explain the crisp , unblemished bills . " Are there any more questions ? " <p> Rick was going to ask the Pillings to give him explicit directions back to the house so he would n't get lost again , but he was nearly moved to tears by the thought that he could not only buy food for the potluck , but also something to eat right away , even before he got to the cash register . Rick was first to rise to his feet , a move which , considering the plush upholstery , took some leverage . The others straggled after him . Meg and Jerry each grabbed a knob of the double-doors and swung them open . " I wish I had a starting gun , " said Jerry . <p> Mitchell paused in the doorway and asked , " Are n't you coming , too ? " <p> From the way the Pillings looked at each other , it was clear this possibility had n't crossed their minds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Jerry . <p> " Your best bet is to head back to the freeway exit , " said Meg . " Toward the commercial district . You ca n't miss it . " She watched her guests scatter across the front lawn , trudging toward their cars . <p> " Just look for signs of life , " yelled Jerry . <p> Once inside his car , Rick noticed Jan in a Mercedes parked across the street , her face lit by the glow of a cigarette lighter , eyes rolling back as she took the first , languorous drag . Parked behind her , Mitchell furrowed his brow and squinted at a road map , disappearing within its folds . Oscar barreled by in his Mustang , shrugging at Rick and honking his horn . Jerry and Meg stood beside each other in the wide bright doorway of their sprawling home . They waved at Rick as he revved his engine , one fluttering arm per spouse . <p> Anyone who saw the Pillings in their doorway that night would have probably taken their happiness and compatibility for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Oscar and Mitchell knew about the couple 's compromised marriage . He would n't have been surprised to learn that Meg and Jerry had let their secrets slip . It 's easy , thought Rick , to confide in someone you see at work , or to someone who runs his fingers through your hair , or probes them into your open mouth . <p> As he pulled away from the curb , he could n't help but marvel at the Pillings ' elaborate domesticity : offspring , swimming pool , blown-glass clowns . While touring their home , Rick sensed that Meg and Jerry meant to impress each other more than their visitors : See what we have . See what we 've done . Our life together is no illusion , no mistake . <p> Since Oscar seemed to know where he was going , Rick tried to catch up with the Mustang 's taillights , but they shot away like comets near a street named Valley Court . Checking his rearview mirror for Mitchell and Jan , he saw nothing but the empty road behind him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Westgate , its lawns trimmed , its houses all alike . He aimed his car toward a concentration of hazy light , a distant promise of people and commerce . <p> It had been so long since Rick cooked a meal , he was worried he 'd forgotten how . Working in his studio till dinnertime , lightheaded from paint fumes , he 'd usually stand before the open refrigerator and nibble at scraps of food , or jump into his car and head for Casa Carnitas , the local taco stand . Dinners had been different when Eric was alive . The two of them sometimes dedicated entire nights to the alchemy of cooking ; gas jets thumped when lit by a match , the raw becoming tender , the cold becoming hot . Chopping and stirring and sauteeing not only took time but seemed to prolong it , the minutes enriched with their arguments and gossip . When their studio grew warm and fragrant with the vapor of sauces , stews , and soups , Rick found himself believing that Eric might never succumb to the virus . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he gained weight . <p> " I would n't be so worried if I could put on a few pounds , " Eric told him one night , peering down at himself as if over the edge of a cliff . The more elusive Eric 's appetite became , the more time he and Rick spent planning and preparing meals . They began to visit ethnic groceries , farmer 's markets , carnicerias , bakeries . At a restaurant-supply store near Chinatown , they bought a garlic press , a set of wire whisks , and what they decided was their most frivolous purchase to date : a lemon zester . Although he often could n't finish a meal , Eric insisted that cooking gave him pleasure , distracted him from the neuropathy that numbed his lips and hands and feet . They had sex less often now that Eric was home all day , groggy from medication , and Rick suspected that their libido , rerouted , had given birth to lavish repasts . <p> In the early evenings , Rick cleaned his brushes , climbed the stairs to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The mattress lay on the floor , surrounded by issues of Art in America , bottles of AZT , and crumpled clothes . Rick would reach beneath Eric 's sweatshirt and rub his back while they watched cooking shows on television , both of them soothed by the warmth and give of skin . On channel thirteen , Madeleine Duprey might fricassee a game hen or make a sumptuous ratatouille , rolling her r 's with such panache , they began to doubt she was really French . Next came Our Man Masami , a chef who dismembered vegetables with a glinting cleaver and , laughing a high , delirious laugh , tossed them into a hissing wok . At six o'clock , a pale and almost inaudible woman on a cable station cooked entrees on a wobbling hot plate , her ingredients spilling on her clothes or the floor . Such clumsiness belied her excitement ; she closed her eyes when tasting the food , chewing fast , a happy rabbit . They took notes while they watched , salivating . They cheered and grumbled like football fans , shouting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Too much cumin ! " <p> Over time , however , it was Rick who grew padded with fat , his trousers tight around the waist , while Eric , whittled by the blade of AIDS , could barely bring himself to eat ; cheeks hollow , eyes indifferent , he 'd prod the food with a fork . <p> Alarmed by Eric 's weight loss , Dr. Santos started him on a regimen of Oxandrin tablets , steroid injections , and cans of a rich nutritional drink . His weight finally stabilized , but his already pale skin continued to grow translucent . Rick began to notice thin blue veins beneath Eric 's temples , wrists , and groin , a glimpse into the tributaries , the secret depths of his lover 's flesh . Still , Rick held on to the hope that he was only imagining Eric 's fragility , making it into something more ominous than it really was . Until one Sunday at the farmer 's market . <p> They were walking back to their car , both of them carrying bags of fresh food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eager for an outing . Enormous clouds raced overhead , their shadows strafing the city streets . Taking a shortcut , they turned down an alley , and a blustery wind funneled toward them . Eric 's jacket blew open  --  the bright red lining flared for an instant , as disconcerting as the sight of blood  --  and he toppled backward , landing on his back . Apples and onions spilled from the bags , scattering among the trash and broken glass that littered the alley . Sprawled on the asphalt , Eric could n't move his arm , and Rick knelt down to cradle his head . " Is this happening ? " Eric asked . An eerie calm tempered Eric 's voice , as if he 'd observed , from far away , the fall of some frail , unlucky stranger . <p> In the emergency room , while Eric was being x-rayed , Rick told the attending physician that Eric must have tripped on a crack in the asphalt and lost his footing . But later , sitting alone in the waiting room , he could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eric over . <p> AZT , it turned out , had made his bones brittle , and so Dr. Santos discontinued Eric 's antivirals while his fractured arm had time to heal . This caused a sequence of illnesses that worsened Eric 's weight loss . The most dire was an inability to absorb nutrients , a condition difficult to treat because the battery of sophisticated lab tests could find nothing wrong . Now and then he managed sips of broth , cubes of Jell-O , diluted juice , but nothing he ate or drank sustained him . Eric was eventually admitted to the hospital for observation and tethered to an IV unit . Rick offered to smuggle into the hospital the heavy , soporific dishes Eric had loved as a child : biscuits with gravy , chicken-fried steak , ice-box cake . But the foods he 'd once loved revolted him now , and Rick 's offer made him feel like a finicky child . " Honey , " he told Rick , " it 's better if you do n't try to feed me . " For days Rick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sleep , his meals growing cold . Nurses swept through the room and changed the IV bag that dripped into Eric 's arm , a clear solution that bypassed the tongue , his body unburdened by texture or taste . <p> Despite daily infusions and the few bites of food he forced himself to eat , Eric was dying of starvation . " AIDS-related wasting , " Dr. Santos told Rick in the corridor , " remains one of our most difficult battles . " The doctor spoke in a solicitous whisper , but Rick heard surrender ring through the ward , drowning out authority and hope . " Do you understand , " asked Dr. Santos , " how wasting works ? " Rick knew very well how wasting worked : lips papery , eyes puzzled , forehead hot , Eric retreated into the stillness and solitude of his body . No wish or prayer or entreaty could restore him . " What more , " he asked the doctor , " do I need to know ? " <p> Looming above the smaller shops and strip malls that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imperious presence of an oil refinery or a power plant . Rick parked his car at the far end of the lot . He 'd given little thought to what he might fix for the potluck . On the drive here , struck by a fresh sense of Eric 's absence , he 'd had to remind himself that a year had passed since his death . Except for teaching two graduate seminars at a local art school , Rick had spent most of that year in his studio , working on paintings of slender , disconnected bones glowing against a black background . Now that the paintings were being shown in New York , Rick had accepted Jerry 's invitation as part of a plan to end his isolation and revive his flagging social life . He did n't know anyone like Meg and Jerry , which accounted for the evening 's strain , and also its sense of adventure . Tonight , anything sounded better than returning to an empty studio . <p> The second he stepped through the supermarket 's automatic doors , Rick heard a tune he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rhythms urging him down the aisles . Wandering past shelves stocked with eye-catching cans and packages , Rick became one big , indiscriminate craving . Everything looked appetizing . In the Pet Food section , basted dog bones seemed like the perfect complement to a sharp Stilton or a salmon pate . In Household Cleaning Products , pastel kitchen sponges had the fanciful , minty appeal of petits fours . The linoleum throughout the store was creamy white and speckled like spumoni . " Your eyes are bigger than your stomach , " he remembered his mother saying when he 'd heaped his plate with more than he could eat . Once , he 'd learned about the world by putting its pretty objects in his mouth  --  the dusty taste of a wooden block , a bitter , waxy bite of Crayola  --  and tonight he 'd reclaimed , without even trying , this long-lost infant wisdom . <p> When he rounded the corner , he caught a glimpse of Jan , in her pinstriped suit , jogging toward Gourmet Foods . With his head turned , Rick almost ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chili . Standing behind a folding table , he wore a white apron and stirred a pot that was heated from beneath by Sterno . Peering inside the pot , Rick saw kidney beans , chunks of tomato , and bits of ruddy onion . The concoction bubbled like lava , small eruptions burping from its surface . " Try some ? " asked the man . He held out a plastic spoon , a dollop of chili steaming at its tip , the smell robust and peppery . <p> Before Rick even began to chew , chili lit the wick of his tongue , his taste buds scorched by exhilarating flame . His eyes watered , nose ran . Perspiration beaded on his skin . He wrenched the spoon out of his mouth and grabbed a can of the stuff , as if reading the ingredients might explain the unearthly surge of heat . " A taste of hell in every bite ! " exclaimed the devil on the label , grinning maliciously . Rick opened his mouth , half expecting to exhale fire and torch the store . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled with Gatorade . " Only thing that cuts the burn " he said . " That cayenne 's got a kick " When he smiled , wrinkles radiated from his brown eyes . His black mustache was waxed at the ends , his jaw shaped like a horseshoe . Rick wanted to thank him , but his throat had closed , leaving him speechless . " Here 's one for the road " said the man , offering Rick another shot . At first , Rick was n't sure if his gallant , folksy manners were real , or his languorous twang authentic . He studied the man through tearing eyes . His name tag read Earl . Dazed in the aftermath of chili , cool air wafting from the dairy case , Rick could n't stop staring . <p> Ordinarily , Rick was n't attracted to dark-haired men , or to men with mustaches , especially waxed . Any guy who reminded him of pot-bellied stoves and tooled-leather belts had always struck him as so remote from his own tastes and sympathies as to be practically extraterrestrial . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Rick because he did n't look or smell like Eric . He 'd dated two men since Eric 's death , but neither involvement lasted long . In the middle of an intimate dinner , he found himself staring across the table at masticating teeth , tuffs of hair on the knuckles of a hand , and though he was glad his companions were mammals , these features were vividly physical without being the least erotic . The one time he did have sex , it was to prove to himself that he could excite someone besides Eric . While flailing naked , he 'd inventory the way he and his new partner made love : now he 's plunging his tongue into my mouth , now I 'm licking the inside of his thigh . He might as well have brought a clipboard to bed . After sex was over , Rick knew he 'd been a lousy lover , mired in the past , hopelessly distracted , as spontaneous as a windup toy . And now , at the Westgate Safeway , of all places , while Muzak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from hibernation . Earl returned Rick 's gaze  --  there was no mistaking  --  with the same flirtatious curiosity . " What brings you to the Safeway ? " Earl asked as he slowly stirred the Inferno . <p> Coated with dust , its brown enamel faded by the sun , Earl 's ancient station wagon looked like a boulder that had rolled into the parking lot . Rick carried the folding table and cooking equipment while Earl gripped a cardboard box filled with cans of Inferno . Now that Earl had taken off his apron , Rick could better see the outline of his body and the motion of his ropy limbs . Earl propped the boxes on the roof of the car and fished in his jean 's pocket for keys . The Golden State Freeway roared in the distance . " By the way " said Earl , " you can keep your five bucks ; there 's no finer way to promote a product than feeding it directly to the people . " <p> " It is n't my money , " Rick reminded him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party . " They lifted the tailgate , loaded the car . As they slid inside and slammed their doors , the station wagon creaked on its springs . " Just throw that crap in the back " said Earl . " I was n't expecting company . " Rick reached down and chucked cans of Sterno , a box of plastic spoons , and a stack of paper cups into the back seat . Crumpled McDonald 's bags and a few empty soft drink cans littered the floor . Rick told Earl that the station wagon reminded him of his studio when he was too steeped in work to think about cleaning , to give order to anything but art ; the disarray was industrious . " I guess I can see that , " said Earl , nodding at the compliment and idling the engine . " It 's in me to give a thing my all . Before selling Inferno , I did a stint at a pitiful little radio station in Buford . My spot was called The Classical Half Hour ; but it was more like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though , this gig 's as solitary as being a DJ . During long hauls , I 've been known to interrogate myself just to have a conversation . " Earl laughed and shook his head . " The things you 'll confess , alone on the road . " He twisted a knob on the dashboard and a tape deck sputtered to life . " Johann Sebastian Bach , " said Earl , upping the volume . " Best antidote I know to a day of Muzak . " He threw the station wagon into reverse . <p> " Do you know your way around Westgate ? " asked Rick . <p> " All I know these days are supermarkets . Anyplace in between is just gas stations and motels . If it does n't have a checkout stand , it 's not on my map . Do n't you know where we 're headed ? " <p> The directions were locked in Rick 's car back at the lot , and after convincing Earl to keep him company , he was n't about to suggest they turn around . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the windshield , doing his best to guess the way back to Meg and Jerry 's . He could n't help but interpret the windshield as a good omen : Earl had traveled numberless gritty miles to meet him , and even if they only spent one night together , the unlikelihood of their having met , combined with the tape deck 's welling arpeggios , made their impromptu date seem predestined . " It 's funny , " said Earl , " to have a passenger . " As Rick leaned toward the dash and squinted at street signs , he told Earl about his conversation with Jerry on the plane . Ail the while , he could sense Earl staring . Lack of subtlety was one of Earl 's most appealing traits , and Rick had to use every ounce of restraint and concentration to keep his mind on the road . But when Earl rested his hand on Rick 's thigh , impulse ordered Rick to pounce . He dove head-first into the driver 's seat , yanked Earl 's shirt from his jeans , and kissed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Earl gasped and arched his back , allowing Rick to lift his shirt higher . Rick pulled his head back far enough to see Earl 's stomach in the emerald light of the dashboard . Wind from the open windows ruffled Rick 's hair and blew into his shirt . The velocity of the car , the rumble of the engine , the bumps in the road felt metabolic . " That , " he said , peering up from Earl 's lap , " is one beautiful bellybutton . " Rick could n't help but notice that the things he said and did that night were unlike him , or at least unlike the recluse he 'd become , and his audacity , like a file baked in a cake , freed him from the cell of himself . He circled and probed Earl 's navel with his tongue . <p> " Yikes , " heaved Earl . " You are an artist ! " He steered the car to the side of the road with one hand and gripped a hank of Rick 's hair with the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grazed the curb and lurched to a stop , its cargo rolling and clattering in the back . <p> Earl 's mouth was wet and generous , his hard jaw covered with stubble . When he moaned , his bony chest rattled with pleasure , an erection tenting his jeans . The more they kissed , the more Rick realized how alone he 'd been , and the more alone he realized he 'd been , the deeper and greedier his kisses became . The restless pressure of Earl 's hands had the power to cause and alleviate need . Finally , the two of them pulled apart long enough to catch their breath and make a plan : an appearance at the potluck , back to the Safeway for condoms and Rick 's car , then on to Earl 's motel . <p> After ringing the doorbell , the two of them waited on the front stoop , cooking equipment in tow . As Rick reached out to squeeze Earl 's shoulder , he remembered reaching beneath Eric 's sweatshirt and rubbing the supple muscles of his back . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> When no one answered the door , they snuck inside the house as quietly as thieves . In the living room , Earl 's eyes widened . " Wow , " he whispered , appraising the place . " Beats the rooms at Best Western . " The guests had gathered in the dining room , where sliding glass doors opened onto the backyard and the luminous pool . Everyone stood around the table and added to the hum of conversation . Even from a distance , Rick could hear the strain of people trying to keep the ball of small talk aloft . A surprised hush greeted Rick as he walked into the room with a stranger . Oscar looked at them quizzically . Rick introduced Earl all around , counting on the possibility that the Pillings were too bent on being " outlandish , " and too restrained by good manners , to object to an uninvited guest . Earl dipped his head and repeated each name . " I sure appreciate the invitation , " he said to Meg . There had been no invitation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prompted her to chime , " We 're glad you could come . " <p> Meg had set the table in anticipation of a buffet . The white tablecloth matched the napkins fanned atop it . Empty china bowls and plates waited to be filled with food . The crystal chandelier cast a faceted light . Rick had to admit that Earl made a scruffy addition to the pristine room and the well-dressed guests ; as a result of their feverish making out , his hair was mussed , his mustache frayed . A stew pot dangled from the end of his arm , and he stood there with the dreamy , limp demeanor of a kid who 'd just awoken from a nap . Rick did n't dare imagine what he looked like , though he suspected a hickey was imprinted on his neck . Propped against Rick 's chest was a cardboard box . He set it on the table and explained that , for a mere five dollars , Earl was going to treat them to an up-and-coming American meal . <p> " Up-and-coming , indeed , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Rick shot Oscar a warning glance . <p> Earl cleared his throat , straightened up , and mustered all the salesmanship he had left . " This is just about the most savory pot of chili you 'll ever taste , " he said , in his polished , disk-jockey modulations . " Inferno 's aiming for a three-year growth plan with a product-recognition goal along the lines of , say , your Dinty Moore or Del Monte . " He lit a fire beneath the pot and began stacking cans of Inferno into a pyramid , display-style . " We 've got quite a few backers in South Dallas , the kind of ranchers who 're all wallet and no cows " <p> Mitchell smiled for the first time that night , and Rick was sure he found Earl attractive . Jerry saw Mitchell smiling at Earl , and his body tensed . It occurred to Rick that Jerry might harbor a secret crush ; did n't Mitchell possess the collegiate look , glasses and all , that had made the airborne Jerry rhapsodic ? Noticing the devil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to share a look of consternation with her husband . When Meg saw Jerry staring at his dentist , the same hunch that occurred to Rick seemed to cross her mind . Her arms slipped loose and fell to her sides . <p> This was the aspect of parties that Rick found most wondrous and suffocating : one suddenly became entangled in the invisible lines of lust or envy or resentment that stretched between the guests , a web of intrigue whose threads are so elusive they only exist in the realm of speculation . Suddenly , Rick was walloped by an idea : a diagram of the party would be his next painting . He imagined , stretching across a wash of muddy color , filaments of strong , unspoken feeling . <p> Once Earl had completed his pitch , the others took turns presenting their purchases . Jan dredged from a Safeway bag , one by one , a can of baby corn cobs , a tin of Norwegian sardines , and a glass jar crammed with tiny white cocktail onions that , even beneath the flattering light of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offerings on the table . Everyone eyed the foreign labels . " It 's gor-may , " she enunciated . " I once had a girlfriend who lived for pickled foods . " Meg blushed , as if " pickled foods " were a euphemism . Jerry began to struggle with the jar of onions , huffing and gritting his teeth until Jan grabbed it from his hand and twisted off the lid with a flick of her wrist . " You loosened it for me " she told him , and Rick imagined that she 'd had to say that , or something equally reassuring , to many men in order to downplay her prowess and spare them embarrassment . She dumped the onions into a bowl . <p> Mitchell contributed three boxes of Munchables , a packaged assortment of lunch meats , crackers , and processed cheese spreads that could be served in various combinations . He ripped open the boxes and , shoulders hunched in an occupational posture , prepared a plate of meticulous hors d'oeuvres . <p> Oscar proffered a one-pound box of marzipan from Heidi 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a strip mall . Everyone o-o-ohed at the replicas of plump strawberries , ripe bananas , and sanguine apples . Each fruit exuded an oily sheen , a sweet almond odor . Meg said , " They 're precious , " and gingerly nibbled a miniature orange . What happened next was something that Rick , who considered himself visually sophisticated , if not downright jaded , had never conceived of , let alone seen . Meg let loose a warble of horror , and her right eyelid began to widen and contract , the eyeball rolling languidly in its socket . Her otherwise mild and maternal presence gave way to a kind of lascivious rapture , and if Meg were n't mortified into silence , Rick would have expected her to purr with delight , lick her own shoulder , or nip at the air . The instant Jerry became aware that his wife was seized by a fit of involuntary blinking , he pulled out a chair into which Meg plummeted . With one hand she applied pressure to her tremulous brow , and with the other held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success to control the upper half of her face , her jaw went lax and revealed a nasty mash of marzipan . When Meg realized she was flashing food at her stunned guests , she shut her mouth with such force , her teeth snapped like the clasp of a purse . <p> " Oh my God , " yelped Mitchell . " I read about it in dental school , but I 've never seen it happen firsthand ! " <p> " What is it ? " barked Jan . She stood erect and ready , as though prepared to pin Mrs. Pilling to the floor if the spasms worsened . <p> Meg waved her hand as if to say , Do n't look at me , please . Everyone crowded closer . <p> Rick tried not to gape , but from this vantage point he could see Mrs. Pilling 's pupil dilating and contracting in an effort to adjust to the changing light , an ocular phenomenon whose helplessness he found hypnotic . The body is such a mystery , he thought ; you forget that your eyes are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organ , that your muscles have a will of their own . <p> Mitchell cut through the huddled crowd and bent over Meg . " Is it Marcus Gunn Reflex ? " he asked . <p> Meg nodded . <p> " You 've heard of it ? " marveled Jerry . " I 'm very impressed . " He dashed through the swinging door and retrieved a glass of water from the kitchen . While Meg took a couple of grateful gulps , Jerry rested his hands on her shoulders , his wedding band catching the light . " It has n't happened in years , has it , darling ? " <p> Meg poked and kneaded her own cheek as if putting the finishing touches on a clay bust . " I think it 's stopped , " she said . She tilted her face toward the light , eager for confirmation . Motionless and circumspect , the party gazed at Mrs. Pilling and waited to see if the twitching returned . A warm breeze blew through the screen doors . A swing set clanked in the backyard . Crickets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mitchell pronounced the episode over , and there came a collective murmur of relief . <p> " Marcus Gunn Reflex is rare , " explained Mitchell . " It 's caused when the chewing muscles and salivary glands are connected to the muscles that control the eyes . Anything can set it off : certain kinds of food , emotional stress , even Novocaine injected into the wrong spot . " <p> " It 's painless " said Meg , " but unpredictable and terribly embarrassing . " <p> " And congenital , " added Jerry . " Her mother first noticed it when she was nursing Meg in the hospital . " It made my baby look like a little sucking glutton ; she used to tell me . So blissful at the teat . ' " <p> Meg twisted around and glared at Jerry . " Thank you , " she said . She took a deep breath and hoisted herself out of the chair . " Will you all excuse me . " Meg fled into the kitchen , indignant and liquid in her blue silk culottes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door stilled then there arose the angry clank of pots , a furious blast of tap water . The Pillings must not have been familiar with the acoustics of their new kitchen because all that decoy noise did little to mask their voices . " I 'm embarrassed enough as it is , Jerry , without you regaling your friends with stories about my breast-feeding . They do n't have to know everything about me . " <p> " What do you mean , embarrassed enough as it is ' ? " <p> " I ca n't look at those people without thinking about what they do with each other in bed . " <p> Oscar sighed a breathy , facetious sigh . " One look at me , and people think of sex . " <p> " They do n't do anything with each other , " said Jerry . " They did n't even know each other until tonight . " <p> Jan peeled the lid from the tin of sardines , releasing a briny reek . A regiment of fish stared back , darkly iridescent . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Motor oil ? " <p> Earl surveyed the buffet . " This , " he said , " is one cockamamie potluck " He hummed under his breath and dished chili into the bowls . <p> " Luck is the operative word in potluck , " mused Oscar . " On the groaning board before you , what looks like mere food is actually the manifestation of chance . " He waved a hand over the table . " Things come together in ways you 'd never expect . " <p> " And fall apart in ways you 'd never expect , " added Mitchell . <p> " Then do n't think about what they do in bed , Meg . " <p> " I ca n't be around them and not think about it . That 's the problem with homosexuals . " <p> " But this party was your idea as much as mine . " <p> " No , Jerry . It was your idea . I agreed to this party because , after consulting with the elders , I was ready to do whatever it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you happy and faithful . But you know what I found out tonight , Jerry ? I found out I 'm old-fashioned . And I 'm tired of being polite . Men laying with men , women with women : it 's a sin , period . And you condone it . " Silverware clanked like scrap metal . " I saw you looking at that Mitchell . " <p> Mitchell took a bite of chili , and his eyes began to water . " Even if I were attracted to Jerry " he said , " I 'd never date a patient . Especially not a heterosexual . It 's hard enough to find someone compatible ; why would I want to make the odds impossible by going after a straight man ? Besides , abscesses and gum recession do n't exactly fan the flames of lust . " He sniffed , removed a handkerchief from his back pocket , and blew his nose . " This is delicious " he said to Earl . <p> " Jerry was cruising the pants off you , " said Oscar . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the clandestine glance . Especially if he plans to stay married " He plucked a tiny pineapple from the table , turning it this way and that to admire its diamonded rind . " Meg is a lovely woman when she 's not besieged by queers . " <p> " Besieged ? " said Rick . " I seem to recall being invited . " <p> " In Texas , " said Earl , " the married ones go to another town when they want to fool around . They 'll do everything with another man but kiss him on the lips , and they think that makes them  --  " <p> " Pure as the driven snow , " said Oscar . " It 's amazing , all the intimate things you can do with another human being and still remain a virgin . " As soon as he popped the marzipan into his mouth , he seemed , for a split second , tangible yet absent , lost in the confection 's density and sweetness . <p> " Do n't tell me you were n't ogling him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " That 's an understatement , " said Oscar . <p> Jan fished a baby corn cob from a bowl . " Hold on , you guys . I do n't blame her for being upset . It 's another case of the wife getting the short end of the stick . I 'm awfully fond of Jerry , but , at the office , he 's one of the boys when he 's with gay men and one of the men when he 's with straight women . " She poked the cob  --  a pale , extraneous finger  --  into the air for emphasis . " Jerry wants it both ways , " she continued , " which would be harmless , I guess , unless you were married to him and had a horde of kids to take care of . None of us would want to be in Meg 's position . " <p> " Of course not , " said Rick , " But the way Jerry explained it ... " <p> Meg hissed , " You twist things around till they suit you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best for  --  " <p> " Me and the kids ? Spare me the piety , Jerry . " <p> " For all of us , I was going to say . Do n't second-guess me . So I think a man is handsome , what 's that have to do with how I feel about you ? " <p> " Nothing , " said Meg . " And it hurts . " <p> " I know what Jerry 's going through , " said Mitchell . " My ex-wife is still furious because I told her I was gay . And because I did n't tell her sooner . " <p> " In other words , " said Rick , " she 's mad at you for failing at the marriage and for trying to make it work . " <p> A glass broke in the kitchen . " Look what you made me do , " shrilled Meg . <p> Mitchell gazed into his plate . " Do you think we should leave ? " <p> " Not me , " said Rick . " I do n't care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night to eat , and I 'm not going anywhere until I 'm full . " He loaded his bowl , took Earl by the hand , and walked outside . At the pool 's edge , Rick yanked off his shoes and socks , rolled up his pants , and dangled his legs in the tepid water . Earl sat behind him , knees against Rick 's back . The two of them gazed into the night sky hovering weightlessly above the suburbs . " Sure would be nice to stay in one place for a while , " lamented Earl . " Tomorrow I 've got a gig at a Market Basket in Placerville . " The bass notes of his voice vibrated in Rick 's rib cage , like the rumble of a truck passing in the distance . Rick might have felt a pang of sadness about Earl 's leaving , but the temperate air , the plentiful stars , and the pool as bright and fathomless as daylight fortified him against despair . Compared to losing Eric , he thought , all my future losses are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earl speak again , he knew this was n't true . " I wish I lived here , " said Earl . His words were so plaintive , so burdened with yearning , that Rick laughed when Earl added , " But then I 'd probably be in the kitchen scrapping with my wife . " <p> Oscar and Mitchell and Jan walked toward the pool , a talkative trio . Each of them held a china plate filled with incongruous food . Rick recognized in their speech and gestures small flourishes of goodwill  --  a stray touch , a teasing retort  --  that a stranger might mistake for flirtation . When Jan delivered the punchline of a joke  --  " And the priest says , Young lady , when you get to heaven , Saint Finger is going to wag his Peter at you ' "  --  laughter displaced the silence of the night . Somehow a party had sprouted in the Pillings ' backyard like a dandelion through a crack in the sidewalk . Rick leaned against Earl 's knees , eating and swinging his legs until waves slapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifesavers drifting on choppy , turquoise currents . <p> The sound of churning water drew two of the Pillings ' children from their rooms . They materialized from behind the swing set at the far end of the house . The youngest , a barefoot girl in an over-sized T-shirt  --  Rick guessed her to be about ten  --  sauntered toward the strangers . She plunked herself down by the water and tried to garner , without seeming to , as much attention as possible . When the inflatable shark drifted toward her , she flung out a leg and kicked it in the snout . The shark wheezed and sailed away . " I 'm Yvonne " she announced . <p> " That 's not her real name " said the boy from the opposite side of the pool , hands thrust in his pockets . Rick had no trouble imagining him as a grown man Who inhabited the periphery of parties , lobbing skeptical remarks into the crowd , eyes animated by the same watchfulness that shone in them tonight . <p> " I 'm the governess , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister " said the boy . " She likes to act bratty and pretend she 's things she 's not . " <p> The girl went on , undaunted . " Are you friends of Mr. and Mrs. Pilling ? " <p> The guests paused , considering her question . <p> " Excuse us " came the voices of Meg and Jerry from inside the dining room . Everyone turned to face them . Jerry stared forlornly into the backyard , as if he were outside the house looking in . " I 'm afraid its late , " he said , pointing to his watch . Meg said , " We hate to be party poopers . " Their voices , strained through the wire mesh of the screen doors , were timid and thin . <p> Oscar bent over and lifted Rick , then Earl , to their feet . Rick brushed off his jeans and glanced at Earl with such overt , erotic promise , Oscar clicked his tongue . <p> Jan and Mitchell hurried their conversation , determined to fit in a few remarks before parting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she finds another husband " said Jan . " If I knew more heterosexual men , I 'd set her up on a blind date . " Mitchell agreed that things would be easier once she was coupled , but behind the gold-rimmed glasses , his eyes conveyed their native doubt . <p> The little girl and her brother bolted across the concrete , flung open the screen doors , and ran into the dining room . Yvonne nearly collided with her father , embracing his leg , and Rick wondered what it would be like to be grabbed by your brash and affectionate child just when love seemed the most farfetched . The boy gravitated toward his mother but remained aloof . He peered into the yard , waiting to see what would happen next . Ever the considerate hostess , Meg reached over and flicked a wall switch ; an outdoor light suddenly blazed beneath the eaves , a magnet drawing moths from the night , their shadows churning against the house . <p> " Shall we take our leave ? " asked Oscar . And the visitors headed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depicted a jackelope , the imaginary offspring of an antelope and a jackrabbit . A postcard from Florida showed a freight train 's flatcar loaded with an orange the size of a house . Earl sent the most surreal cards he could find , either because he favored them or thought they 'd appeal to the artist in Rick . They arrived every few weeks , a reminder that the world 's oddities were inexhaustible . <p> Eventually , however , the cards stopped coming , as Rick knew they would . He often chided himself for not writing back , but Earl never asked for a reply or included a return address . Besides , Rick was at work on a new painting , and , apart from a nagging set of technical and aesthetic preoccupations , he had little to talk about . He 'd come to think of his encounter with Earl as a thing completed , an improvised composition that one more brush stroke would ruin . <p> And then , just as Rick was about to relegate his evening in Westgate to the past , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those Xeroxed family newsletters sent out at Christmas . Rick thought of them as artifacts from his parents ' generation , a form of braggadocio in the guise of a greeting , its gossip purged of secrets and upheavals . The Pillings ' newsletter was printed on red paper decorated with sprigs of holly  --  Meg 's choice , Rick was certain . Itemized in alphabetical order were the academic and athletic victories of their six children . Rick noted with amusement that nowhere was there mention of a girl named Yvonne . Other than parental hyperbole , the highlights of Meg and Jerry 's year were reserved for the last two sentences : We visited the big island of Hawaii in September , where we glimpsed the fury of a live volcano . Upon our return , Jerry assumed a position on the church 's high council . <p> Rick turned the letter over , searching for a salutation scrawled in the margins , or for some note that would say what became of Jerry and whether his equivocations persisted . But the margins were empty , and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter into the rolltop desk he 'd inherited from Eric , and swiveled around to face his latest painting . The cavernous studio contained a homey commotion of paintbrushes , dropcloths , and old coffee cans encrusted with acrylics . Outside the windows , sunlight burned through the clouds and ignited random patches of the city  --  a glass high-rise , a peeling billboard  --  then quickly faded away . The fluid , moody light animated his painting . Its imagery was based on his recollection of the Saturday morning cartoons in which trails of enticing odor wafted from hot pies , freshly baked bread , and juicy pot roasts ; then as now , he loved how those long ghostly arms rippled through a room and caressed a face , burrowed into nostrils , and beckoned to the hungry with curling fingers . Follow . Taste . Be sated . Rick leaned forward . Thanks to hours spent feathering wet paint with a small brush , tendrils of scent reached across the canvas . One moment they seemed to float closer . The next they seemed to recede . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
