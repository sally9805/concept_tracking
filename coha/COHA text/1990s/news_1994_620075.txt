<p> Inside of Meryl Streep , the Oscar-winning actress , star of more than 22 films and mother of four children , lives a young girl whose imagination is so strong she is always a princess who never has to eat her vegetables . <p> For Streep , it 's not fortune , and clearly not fame , that drives her career . " The imagination is the thing , " she said in a reflective moment in the midst of an off-the-beaten track promotional blitz . " It is a desire and a thing that comes out of my childhood of not being able to be shaken out of your fantasy world . " Acting , she said , " is having an unshakable conviction like children in the grandeur of their pretend games . " <p> Streep materialized in Whitefish , with her director and co-stars , in a parklike setting on a mountain lake in northwest Montana , to help promote Universal Pictures ' " The River Wild , " her first **25;348;TOOLONG story . <p> In blue jeans and boots , blue blazer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a wood-paneled , enclosed porch , where she spoke about acting , her career , motherhood , her family , the new film and her next project . <p> She was fresh , engaging and disarmingly direct . Streep said she has stopped giving any thought to her public image ( although her publicist refused to allow photographers to take her picture in Whitefish ) . " After being famous for a long time your image is way far out and inaccessible to you and you ca n't manipulate it at all . So I just give up , " said Streep . " I have this new feeling that I do n't have to explain myself anymore . <p> " When I was younger I was very intent on being understood . But I learned at some point that nobody ever figures you out and some people are completely driven by what they want to think of you . Now I 'm too old to have to explain . " Streep is 45 . <p> " The River Wild , " which was filmed last summer on the Kootenai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone dead and the river-rafting vacation that a family embarks upon to restore communication . <p> The character Streep plays , a woman who had once been a river-rafting guide , takes her husband , played by David Strathairn ( " A Dangerous Woman , " " The Firm " ) and son , played by Joseph Mazzello ( " Jurassic Park , " " Shadowlands " ) down the river . But along the way they encounter two fleeing small-time but sinister robbers played by Kevin Bacon ( " Footloose , " " A Few Good Men " ) and John C. Reilly ( " Hoffa " ) . <p> Universal Pictures has delayed release of the film until September 30 , not wanting to put it up against the tide of other summer movies . <p> In Montana , the film previewed to sensational audience response on three separate showings , including cheers and shouts in all the right places . Streep wields the oars in this uncustomary action role with a flair that rivals Schwarzenegger ; Bacon is completely engaging in the villain 's role . <p> Director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ) mastered difficult technical problems filming from rafts , helicopters and in dangerous rapids with the use of a river safety unit numbering almost 200 people , and Streep became an adept rafter on the shoot . Before the film , her only rafting experience had been as a passenger . <p> " Being here for four months , outside on the river , was an enticement . And I wanted to do something very physical , " said Streep . She trained for the role on a 38-mile trip down Oregon 's Rogue River , but " I thought it would be a lot of ( shots ) very far away , with someone else at the oars . " But Hanson used Streep in about 90 percent of the river footage . <p> The actors sometimes literally got in over their heads during filming . At one point Streep 's raft got stuck in a " hole " in the rapids and she abandoned ship . She was sucked under the water and carried downstream where the river unit rescued her . Bacon was thrown from a raft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not find him at first , but he was eventually plucked from the river . <p> Bacon , asked about the danger of filming the river scenes , said : " I really , really want to do a western , you know , horses and six-shooters . I could do without getting wet for a while . " <p> Streep said she is not someone who naturally takes physical risks . " But when the role , and its physicality , came along I found that I was inspired by my kids . " Streep has four children , ages 14 , 11 , 8 and 3 . She said that as she has gotten older she has become " more of a ' be careful , do n't do that , do n't let her ( 3-year-old ) put that in her mouth , that 's too high , I 'm going to come get you right now if you do n't get down ' kind of person . <p> " But my kids , they seem to have so much more fun than I do . And their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to imagination again , " she said of approaching the role . " I thought I 'd try to get back to what was , like remembering the feeling when I was 10 , going up really high in a tree that started going back and forth because I was a little too heavy for the top of it . I just wanted to go one more ( branch ) . " <p> Streep lives with her husband , who is a sculptor , and their children on a lake in upstate Connecticut . Like Gail , her character in " The River Wild " who uses the river as a psychic touchstone , Streep says she relies on the outdoors and rural living . " It 's something that makes me happy deep inside , " she said . <p> Streep and her husband purchased the Connecticut property while she was filming " Out of Africa " in 1984 . " We saw a picture of a lake in the New York Times real estate section , and the thought of leaving Africa  --  we were up over the Serengeti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of going to the eighth floor on Central Park West , with a neighbor upstairs , a neighbor downstairs , people everywhere and putting my kids there " did n't work , Streep said . <p> " I 've never regretted the move to the country , but I do need an infusion of city energy , and we go in to the museums and the theater and then we congratulate ourselves on the move out after we get back because the city is hard , " she added . <p> In fact , that was one of the reasons that led her to turn down an offer by Joseph Papp to take over New York 's Shakespeare in the Park . When Papp , who knew he was dying , wanted to hand-pick his successor to run the theater company , he chose Streep . She was astonished by the offer . <p> But , even though she called the offer " elegant and wonderful , " Streep added , " Joe did n't understand the value I placed on my family and being with them , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and being anything else , not just acting . In a way , acting lets me have a lot of time that I would n't have had in that or any other job . <p> " So I 've made that choice , but in a way my job is very friendly to mothers because I do n't have a gigantic ambition to direct , or have my own production company or to impress anybody with how powerful I am , " she continued . " I like to work three or four months at a time and then stop . Then I 'm with my family all the time . " <p> Streep said she 's not about to complain about her life ( " Acting is what I want . I have a very healthy understanding of how lucky I am to do these things . " ) and said that " like every other mom in America , I always feel late , strained , overextended and like I 'm disappointing someone . " <p> But the strain has n't hurt her work . Streep 's films have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine times and she has won two Academy Awards ( for " Kramer vs . Kramer " in 1979 and for " Sophie 's Choice " in 1982 ) . <p> Next , she goes to work on " The Bridges of Madison County , " with Clint Eastwood as co-star and director . Streep said she has been misquoted about the book on which the movie is based , which sold more than 40 million copies . " I never said I did n't like the book , " she clarified . " I said I was n't struck by it in that soul-shattering way that millions were . " <p> She said she understood readers being intrigued with the novel and understood the attraction of being lost and in love for four days of your life . " I loved the script ( by Richard LaGravenese , who scripted " The Fisher King " ) because it did n't have , you know , how they looked when they felt these things , " Streep said . " LaGravenese has done more to characterize them . <p> " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To look at what they say to each other and then imagine how they feel . I hated that thing ( in the book ) of being told how they feel every sentence ... Yet I do understand the core sort of desire for that delirium , that golden bubble of experience that is above and beyond everything else in your life . " <p> Both of her current roles , in " River " and " Bridges , " were written as women over 40 . Asked about the availability of parts for actresses in her age group , Streep laughed and said her agent only sends her things for people over 40 " and there 's not a big full mailbox . Sometimes I just say I 'm not reading any scripts and maybe that 's good because there is nothing coming in anyway . " <p> But , she hastened to add , film is storytelling and fantasy and there is an element in it " that has to be alluring and attractive . I 'm aware of it , and fall prey to it and I worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ River Wild . " <p> " You know there are some women guides on the rivers who weigh 160 pounds and I know that the studio would not have been happy " if she chose to play the role that way . " Even if they are really beautiful , and their biceps are fabulous . <p> " You know , when I was in high school , " Streep said , " my favorite thing ... I saw Simone Signoret in ' Ship of Fools . ' I remember she wore a satin slip and a layer of her stomach came out there ( through it ) and I think there was nothing more sexy . <p> " And we 've devolved , or something , since then . But I do n't worry about aging onscreen because I 'm a person , and people grow old . I do n't worry about aging because I like to see people 's lives written on their faces . The more that 's there , the more there is to look at . " <p> And when she looks , she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a child imagining a princess . " It 's like being told : ' You are not a princess now , you are going to eat your dinner . ' I can remember being told ' That 's enough now , ' and I would see how far I could go with it , " Streep said . Laughing , she added : " And I am a princess , and you 'll call me Louise and I wo n't eat any vegetables . " <p> " It 's important to imagine and dream like that , for all of us , " Streep said . " Even with my kids , after a while , I realized that it does n't matter what they learn , it matters only that their spirit remains untrammeled , alive , alert and eager . " <p> ' The River Wild ' opens Friday , September 30 , at the AMC Kabuki in San Francisco and other Bay Area theaters.
