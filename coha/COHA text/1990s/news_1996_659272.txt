<p> The Hubble constant is 56 . Or maybe it 's 70 . <p> Either way , a decades-long debate about the age , scope and fate of the universe seems to be coming to a close - though that does n't mean there 's nothing left to talk about . <p> Cosmology , the study of the history and nature of the universe , is really just " the search for a few numbers , " says Martin Rees of England 's Cambridge University . And the Hubble constant is a big number that could hold the key to some other big numbers and to some rather large questions . <p> " The pace of cosmology has never been faster , " Rees said . " By the year 2000 , I think some of these questions will be answered . " <p> The Hubble constant is sort of a yardstick for the expanding universe , because it tells astronomers how fast galaxies and other astronomical objects are moving away from one another . <p> It is complicated stuff , but the universe is not a sandbox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given to concepts like megaparsecs and cosmological constants ; their battles are waged in a cloud of abstractions . <p> In June , experts gathered at Princeton University in Princeton , N.J. , to engage in one-on-one debates over the history and nature of the universe . Most of the debates were over numbers . <p> In one of the first bouts , Wendy Freedman of the Carnegie Observatories in Pasadena , Calif. , announced her current estimate of the Hubble constant - 70 , give or take 10 , kilometers per second per megaparsec . <p> That means that , on average , astronomical objects separated by a million parsecs , or 3.26 million light-years , are receding from each other at a rate of about 70 kilometers a second , or 156,000 mph . <p> Freedman 's opponent , Gustav Tammann of the University of Basel in Switzerland , denigrated that estimate . " Pre-Copernican , " he sniffed . <p> But most observers did n't consider his estimate of the Hubble constant too far from hers . Using roughly the same observations that Freedman 's group did , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 56 , plus or minus 10 ; thus the high end of Tammann 's estimate overlaps the low end of Freedman 's . That 's quite a change from less than two years ago , when Freedman and friends were getting values near 80 and Tammann and his colleagues were pinning the Hubble constant at around 40 . <p> " I would say the game 's over , " said Robert Kirshner of Harvard University in Cambridge , Mass . <p> But the conclusion of the " Hubble Wars , " as Kirshner calls them , does n't end the hostilities . Fighting continues on a number of fronts , including the total mass of the universe and its age . <p> Knowing the value of the Hubble constant helps cosmologists estimate the age of the universe . The higher the constant , the younger the universe is thought to be . If the Hubble constant really is near 70 , then classical cosmological scenarios would put the universe 's age at about 9 billion years . <p> And that 's why the story is n't over : The universe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient stars are thought to be 13 billion years old , and almost certainly are more than 10 billion years old . <p> That age paradox has been widely reported over the last few years . But it 's not really a problem in itself , argues University of Chicago astronomer David Schramm , because a mess of other numbers still are left to be worked out before cosmologists are ready to tackle the universe 's age . <p> For example , the more mass and energy there is , the faster the universe 's expansion will slow down due to gravity and other effects . In a nearly empty universe , it would have taken nearly 14 million years to reach the universe 's current point . That 's plenty of time to create the most ancient stars . <p> But cosmologists do n't know how full of mass and energy the universe is . In fact , that 's one of their biggest uncertainties . <p> Cosmologists express the amount of matter and energy , both of which slow the universe 's expansion , with a number known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's enough mass and energy to gradually slow the big bang expansion , but not enough to reverse it . <p> But the astronomers who are trying to weigh the universe simply ca n't find enough stuff to bring its mass up to the magical value . Neta Bahcall of Princeton said that surveys of giant galaxy clusters spanning millions of light-years hold only enough matter to bring omega up to 0.2 . <p> Another method hints at a higher value for omega , however . Several teams of astronomers are working on an even bigger scale , looking at the motions and distributions of the giant galaxy clusters . With that information , they can estimate how much matter is tugging on the groups of galaxies , not just the amount in the clusters themselves . That might turn up matter that ca n't be seen by other means . <p> The method uses sophisticated computer programs that simulate the flow of galaxy clusters as if they were spilt milk sloshing through the cosmos . But the computer programs are n't refined enough yet to be dependable , so most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But one specific study using computer simulations of galactic flows shows that omega has to be at least 0.3 , said Avishai Dekel of Hebrew University in Jerusalem . <p> The Void is a big , empty patch of universe sandwiched between two giant galaxy clusters - the Great Attractor and the Southern Wall . Dekel and his colleagues have imagined that whole neighborhood as a mountain range , where denser accumulations of galaxies mean higher peaks . <p> The researchers looked at the speed at which material on the Void 's edges is pulled toward the two clusters by gravity . The faster it was pulled , the denser the surrounding regions . <p> That amount of material implies an omega of at least 0.3 , Dekel reported in Princeton . <p> But more than 0.3 is a far cry from 1 . If cosmologists ca n't find enough matter to fill the universe to their satisfaction , they have only two ways out : They can adapt their thinking to a much less massive universe , or they can invoke yet another number - the cosmological constant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " A specter is haunting physics , " said Steven Weinberg of the University of Texas at Austin . " It 's the specter of the cosmological constant . " <p> Albert Einstein once referred to the cosmological constant as his biggest mistake , a fudge factor that he stuck into some equations just to make them work . But some researchers are taking the idea seriously , partly because physics now has a way of explaining how a cosmological constant could arise and partly because it would fit nicely into the current situation - a high Hubble constant , an omega less than 1 and a universe more than 10 billion years old . <p> Because of that , said Schramm , the University of Chicago astronomer , " it 's not something you can completely dismiss . " <p> If it exists , the cosmological constant would provide a repulsive force , supplementing the big bang expansion of the universe . That would make the universe appear younger than it actually is , as many cosmologists think it does . <p> The constant also would supplement omega @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's essentially the same thing as having more mass in the universe , because energy and matter are ultimately the same thing . That 's what Einstein 's famous " E equals mc squared " equation means . <p> So in spite of scientists ' queasiness about it , the cosmological constant could help them answer two big questions about the universe : Why it looks so young , and why there does n't seem to be enough matter in it . <p> So far , however , the best argument in favor of a cosmological constant borders on silliness . It says that if a cosmological constant is the only way of producing a universe where humans can evolve into thinking beings capable of exploring the cosmos , then the number has to exist or else we would n't be here wondering about it . <p> That idea is known as the anthropic principle . Cosmologists find it unsatisfying , because it does n't actually help them understand anything . <p> But better explanations are bound to come with more complete observations of the universe , experts say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space and the Keck in Hawaii , can help measure and weigh the universe . And other instruments can shed light on events that happened not long after the big bang . <p> With such observations , cosmologists say , they finally can base their arguments on actual evidence after years of relying on theory . <p> " The whole subject has just toned up a lot from being flabby and vague , " said Harvard 's Kirshner . " I would say things have never been better . "
