Since he purchased an option last April that allows him to buy the Seattle Seahawks for an estimated $200 million , billionaire Microsoft cofounder Paul Allen has been boosting the fortunes of the long-struggling Seahawks as if he already owned them . In mid-February he gave the green light to sign former Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker Chad Brown , the best free agent on the market , to a $24 million contract . Before last weekend 's NFL draft he gave the front office a thumbs-up to spend big , and the Seahawks wheeled and dealed their way into position to make two of the first six picks , selections that will cost more than $10 million in signing bonuses alone . All the while Allen has been jousting with the Washington State government over a plan to build a $425 million stadium . He has even offered to contribute as much as $200 million to help get the place erected . // But if legislators do n't clear the way for the stadium , which would be funded mostly by tax dollars , here 's what will happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seahawks , will write off the $25 million or so he will have spent on the team and will walk away . Seattle owner Ken Behring will look elsewhere for a buyer , and in all likelihood Cleveland or Los Angeles will pick up an NFL franchise that will have been richly enhanced by a mere passerby. // If that grim scenario comes to pass , pro football in the Great Northwest will at least have gone out in a blaze of glory on draft day 1997 . At a time when most teams were looking for ways to avoid spending big money on rookies ( page 100 ) , Seattle was the most aggressive team in the draft , and the Seahawks came away with two players they desperately needed : Ohio State cornerback Shawn Springs and Florida State tackle Walter Jones . // In February the Seahawks , who by virtue of their 7-9 record in 1996 held the 12th draft choice , dealt quarterback Rick Mirer to the Chicago Bears for a first-round pick ( No. 11 ) , then traded that selection and their second- , third- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 choice and the Falcons ' third-rounder . The third overall pick would be used to select the 6-foot , 200-pound Springs , a gifted cover guy . // But Seattle coach Dennis Erickson and his staff also wanted the 6 ' 5 " , 301-pound Jones , a junior who played two years at Holmes ( Miss . ) Community College and only 12 games at the major college level . Jones was projected as a low first-round pick until he ran the 40 in 4.6 seconds for NFL scouts last month , causing his stock to soar . Nonetheless , on the eve of the draft , Seahawks vice president of football operations Randy Mueller sold Behring and Bob Whitsitt , Allen 's go-between in the Seattle front office , on the idea of trying to jockey into position to select Jones . Then Whitsitt called Allen . // Aware that anti-Seahawks sentiment at the state capital was running high , Whitsitt warned his boss . " You could be out of this in three days . Dennis and Randy think they can move up and get this great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If they get Springs and this tackle , it could cost $13 million in signing bonuses alone . " // " What did we say when we got into this ? " Allen replied . " If we 're involved , we 're involved . Are we still involved ? " // " Yeah , " Whitsitt said . // " Then we have to do it , " Allen said . // Last Saturday , Ohio State tackle Orlando Pace went on the first pick to the St. Louis Rams , and then the Oakland Raiders took Southern Cal defensive tackle Darrell Russell . Seattle got Springs , and when Florida State defensive end Peter Boulware and Texas cornerback Bryant Westbrook went to the Baltimore Ravens and the Detroit Lions , respectively , the Seahawks thought they had Jones . Seattle had tentatively arranged a deal with the New York Jets , whereby the Jets would send the sixth pick to the Seahawks for the No. 12 and Seattle 's third-and sixth-round picks . Or so Mueller thought . // But then Jets director of player personnel Dick Haley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 12th . Instead , the Jets swung a trade with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in which they moved down only two spots , to No. 8. // Crestfallen , Mueller hung up . He expected the Bucs to take Jones . Why else move up ? " It was like I got kicked right in the groin , " said Seahawks offensive line coach Howard Mudd . But a minute later the phone rang again . It was Tampa Bay general manager Rich McKay , who was looking to deal the pick he had just acquired . Mueller asked McKay what he wanted for it . " Your three , " McKay replied . In other words , the Bucs would give up the No. 6 pick for the Seahawks ' choice at No. 12 plus Seattle 's third-round pick , No. 63 overall . // Stunned that he could move up so cheaply , Mueller accepted . The Seahawks had been prepared to throw in their fifth-round pick to get Jones . " It 's the kind of luck you get maybe once a decade in the draft , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Seattle , with no picks in the second or third rounds , was finished for the day 45 minutes after the draft had started . // " Mr. Allen has made it all possible , " says defensive end Michael Sinclair , noting that in addition to Brown , the team has signed three other free agents : quarterback Warren Moon and defensive backs Bennie Blades and Willie Williams . " The man does n't have deep pockets . He has an abyss . Until this year the most we 've done in free agency is take backups . Now we 're loaded on defense , and defense wins championships . For the first time I truly believe we 'll go to the Big Game . " // Assuming Sinclair has the gift of prophesy , the question then becomes . When he goes to the Super Bowl , will Sinclair be representing Seattle , Cleveland or Los Angeles ? // That 's because Allen says he wo n't exercise his option if an acceptable stadium plan is n't in place by July 1 . Governor Gary Locke and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voters  --  a referendum that Allen has volunteered to pay for , at a cost of $3.4 million  --  but as of Monday the House of Representatives was leaning against putting the issue to a June vote . Apparently some politicians had n't gotten over how , after voters had narrowly defeated a proposal for a $320 million baseball stadium for the Mariners in a September 1995 measure , the deal was ramrodded through the legislature just after the team clinched the ' 95 American League West title . " The taxpayers got raped the last time , " says Representative Helen Sommers . " Why do it again ? " Also , some politicians are n't crazy about giving aid to a man whose net worth is an estimated $11 billion . // However , there are no other potential owners in the area . As NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue said last Saturday , " Pro football in Seattle would be in a long , dark tunnel , with no light at the end . There is no Plan B without Paul Allen . " // Allen has offered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center on the site where the Kingdome stands . Although he will retain no ownership in the complex , he has offered to pay for all construction-associated cost overruns . He has offered to cover as much as $100 million in losses that would be incurred by the Seahawks and King County after the Kingdome is demolished , probably in 1999 , and before the complex opens in 2002 . Throw in the cost of the franchise and the referendum plus the $21 million or so he has committed to contract bonuses this year ( under terms of his agreement to buy the team , Allen pays for 80% of all new expenditures , such as salaries and bonuses , and Behring the other 20% ) , and Allen would be in for about $425 million . // " Well , California would be O.K. , I guess , " says Sinclair , whose NFL career spans Seattle 's current streak of seven seasons without a winning record .
