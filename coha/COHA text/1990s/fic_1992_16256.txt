EXT. /INT . POLICE CAR April , 1942 - NIGHT We hear a Dispatcher 's monotonous voice over a hissing police radio . &nbsp; DISPATCHER ( VO ) Signal 30 . Two-three-six Thompson Street . Inside the car , the Young Cop who 's driving angles forward in his seat , pressing heavily on the gas .  --  3  --  His older partner stares forward , blankly . CUT TO : EXT. 236 THOMPSON STREET - SAME A respectable working-class block . Neighbors are clustered by the stoop in robes , pajamas , undershirts . A woman with young children holds them to her nightgown . All watch as The Cops pull up by the curb and rush from their squadcar . They push their way through the crowd . &nbsp; TEENAGER ( in an undershirt , grinning ) Third floor . The Cops continue into the building . INT . STAIRWELL - 236 THOMPSON The Cops move stealthfully up the dim stairwell , guns drawn . On the third-floor landing , a door is ajar . Light spills out onto the floorboards . As they ascend , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young man inside : It lies face down , its features rudely pressed and bloody against the floor . A freshly-blocked hat lies a few feet from the dead man ; he was shot as he came home . On the landing , the Cops move carefully to the door , hugging the wall . They hear someone moving inside the apartment . They freeze , barely breathing . The older Cop cocks his gun , crosses himself , wraps his hand around the doorframe . He jumps into THE APARTMENT crouching , gun drawn . A crackling , blistering sound is heard as a flash of light fills the room , blinding him . &nbsp; COP ( blinking as he stands ) Jesus .  --  4  --  REVERSE : A flashbulb hits the floor hollowly . BERNZY ( whose real name is Leon Bernstein and whose professional name is " The Great Bernzini " ) inserts a new bulb in the giant chrome flash attachment of his Speed Graphic press camera . A cigar is planted in the corner of his mouth . Bernzy cuts a curious figure : He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomodate camera lenses , film plates and flashbulbs . His thick-soled shoes are sensible to a fault . He wears a hat but no tie . His face is alert and ironic , his movements rapid and purposeful . &nbsp; BERNZY ( to the Cop , deadpan ) You scared me . He reaches into his jacket to extract a new 4 5 ? glass film plate ( from a bag of plates hung over his shoulder ) with a well-practised , unhurried speed . The older cop , O'BRIEN , is annoyed ; his comment sounds like an accusation . &nbsp; O'BRIENWe were n't six blocks from here when it come over the radio . Bernzy is lining up another shot ; he speaks from behind both cigar and camera . &nbsp; BERNZYI killed him . To get the pictures . The Young Cop has entered . Bernzy waves him back . &nbsp; BERNZYYou 're casting a shadow . He backs up , obligingly . Bernzy takes his shot . The Young Cop kneels by the corpse . He finds a gun in the waist-band of its suit trousers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week . &nbsp; O'BRIEN ( to Bernzy ) Who 'd this guy work for , Bernzy ?  --  5  --  But Bernzy hears a car pulling up outside , a car door slamming . He peers down into the street through the window . Bernzy 's POV : Another Photographer is arriving . He crosses the street , lugging a press camera . &nbsp; O'BRIENBernzy ! &nbsp; BERNZYI think Farinelli . But he 's not lookin ' his best tonight . . . Could you move his hat closer ? &nbsp; O'BRIENWhat ? &nbsp; BERNZYHis hat . The hat . People like to see a dead guy 's hat . O'Brien grudgingly picks up the hat , drops it closer to the corpse . The flashbulb fires . CUT TO : EXT . ALLEY - NIGHT Bernzy , in the alley alongside the building , is hunched over the open trunk of his sedan on a camp stool . The car trunk has been turned into a darkroom . The truck lamp has been replaced with a darkroom bulb . A drying line is suspended over a shallow tub . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ super-flash photo lamps , an open box of cigars , a pot of glue , various cameras and lenses , and a tiny , battered typewriter . ) Bernzy looks up into the apartment window as the explosion of a flashbulb-fills the window . Bernzy unpins four nearly dry photos on the line , fans them in the air , lays them face down on the trunk floor , and stamps their backs with his identifying imprint : Deco lettering is surround by the stamped outline of an eye , like something on an optometrist 's sign . Around the upper and lower lids of the eye it says " CREDIT PHOTO TO - THE GREAT BERNZINI " . In the center of the eye it says " THE PUBLIC EYE " He slams the trunk shut . CUT TO :  --  6  --  Section Details INT . DAILY NEWS BUILDING - NIGHT CLOSE ON a Daily News check , made out to Leon Bernstein . On a stub , the check is carefully accounted for . 1 Corpse ( 2 bullets @ $1.50 each ) . . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riding down in an elevator , folds the check into his pocket . INT . DAILY NEWS LOBBY The elevator doors open , Bernzy steps out . The Photographer we saw leaving Thompson St. steps into the lobby . He only has to see Bernzy to know he 's too late . &nbsp; PHOTOGRAPHERShit . CUT TO : INT. /EXT . BERNZY 'S SEDAN/STREET - NIGHT Bernzy drives , his eyes intently scanning the nighttime street . A steady , low hiss is emitted from a police radio , that is gerry-rigged under his dusty dashboard , swaying on its wires . A metal plate on the radio says FOR POLICE VEHICLES ONLY . Bernzy 's Speed Graphic , with flash , sits on the seat next to him . As Bernzy reads every shadow and doorway for potential pictures , We see what he sees out the window ( buildings and people ) in black and white , slightly overcranked : the POV of Bernzy 's trained eye . CUT TO : INT . TENEMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT On the landing of the stairwell , a young Puerto Rican Woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She 's in her nightgown . A flashbulb fires over her . The narrow stairway is packed with Policemen and Puerto Rican neighbors in their T-shirts , pajamas and robes .  --  7  --  A COP leads two Ambulance Attendants , with a stretcher , up the stairs shouting as he goes . &nbsp; COPClear the way , get back , c'm on , c'm on ' , c'm on  --  Now he passes Bernzy , near the top of the stairs  --  &nbsp; COPBernzy , clear outta here . Bernzy is taken aback  --  &nbsp; BERNZYBut I hear this guy 's walkin ' around with a meat cleaver in his head  --  !  --  as if it 's every man 's God-given right to photograph such a rare sight . &nbsp; COPGet the Hell out . As the Cop heads into the Woman 's apartment , he speaks to the ambulance Attendants , but looks at Bernzy as he does so . &nbsp; COPThrow a sheet over him . The Cop is suspiciously keen to thwart Bernzy : Bernzy smells something . He turns to a Puerto Rican MAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T-shirt and boxers . &nbsp; BERNZYWho is this guy , anyway ? &nbsp; MAN ( Puerto Rican accent ) Working for the Mayor . Visits at night . Bernzy sizes up the elements of the tragedy as the Orderlies bring the victim out of the apartment . He looks at the hysterical mistress and then at her victim/paramour , who is covered with a sheet , but moving ( with a comically high protrusion where the meat cleaver is lodged ) . Bernzy  --  his eyes as keen as a fox 's  --  takes a last look at the covered stretcher  --  not a good picture  --  then heads quickly down the stairs .  --  8  --  EXT . TENEMENT HOUSE - NIGHT Bernzy opens the cavernous trunk of his car . He sorts through a cigar box containing various tools of the photographer 's trade , including a scissors he uses to crop prints . He picks up the scissors . He strips off his coat . CUT TO : EXT . TENEMENT HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER The Attendants load the stretcher into the back of the waiting limousine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Attendants climbs in back , the other gets in the front , next to the Driver . The ambulance pulls out . Siren . INT . AMBULANCE - SAME Bernzy sits in the back of the ambulance . He has cut a square in the back of his jacket collar , then put the jacket on backwards , to simulate a clerical collar . &nbsp; BERNZY ( to the Attendant ) Better uncover him , son . The Attendant complies . We do n't see the corpse , but the handle of the meat cleaver juts up ludicrously into the frame and it moves back and forth as the victim moans . Even Bernzy is taken aback . &nbsp; BERNZYJesus . Not the thing a priest would say ; he crosses himself to cover . Bernzy begins to mutter piously , indecipherably , over the ailing man . He waves something over the man , like a bottle of Holy Water when the last rites are administered . We see what he 's waving : a light meter . Still muttering , Bernzy reads the meter . The Attendant looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wait a second .  --  9  --  From his oversized pocket , Bernzy withdraws a 35 mm camera . He gets his shot fast , before the Attendant can react . SHOCK CUT TO : EXT . STREET - NIGHT A Man in a hat watches as the ambulance comes to an abrupt halt . The Man watches as The back doors open and a " priest " spills out  --  half leaping , half pushed . The " priest " lands on his ass in the street ( careful to protect his camera ) as the Attendant slams the ambulance doors . The ambulance takes off again . The " priest , " unfazed , dusts himself off as he hails a cab with a cheerful serious determination . &nbsp; BERNZYTaxi ! As the cab squeals away with the " priest " , the Man in the hat wonders what he just saw . CUT TO : Section Details INT .

It 's still twenty dollars . &nbsp; EDDYYou got a release on this guy ? &nbsp; BERNZYYou got a spirit medium on staff ? &nbsp; EDDYYou checked with the hospital ? Bernzy nods . Eddie opens the big ledger-style checkbook , starts to write the check .  --  10  --  &nbsp; BERNZYDid n't even make it to Bellvue , poor bastard . Thank God I was able to administer his last rites . CUT TO : INT . ALL-NIGHT DRUGSTORE - NIGHT In black and white , overcranked , we watch a Sailor and his Girl necking in the rear-booth of a drugstore . &nbsp; WOMAN 'S VOICE ( OS ) That 's not very polite . At normal speed , in color , we see Bernzy , sitting at a booth near the counter of the drugstore , staring at the young couple . He has a cup of coffee , a plate of eggs and his camera on the table . Bernzy , caught staring , looks up at the WOMAN . &nbsp; WOMANI know what it 's like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across from Bernzy . She has plain , well-scrubbed features , and wears a raincoat . A Nurse and a Doctor are at the next booth . &nbsp; BERNZYProfessional interest . . . ( he puts the camera to his eye ) See ? &nbsp; WOMAN ( ignoring this ) Break-time comes , there 's nobody to talk to , you feel lonely , right ? ( a beat ) How much you got on you ? Bernzy looks at her a beat before picking up the camera again . He shoots the Girl and the Sailor , rather than answer her . &nbsp; BERNZYTomorrow He Sails  --  That 's the caption . &nbsp; WOMANC'mon , how much ? There 's no harm in it .  --  11  --  &nbsp; BERNZYMy wife would n't like it . Bernzy throws a dollar on the table , collects his camera : he 's in a hurry to get away . Meantime : &nbsp; WOMANHoney , you 're not married and you do n't have a girl : I saw how you were looking at those two . Bernzy gets up to go . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to hear her , as he heads for the door . She Calls after him , with a plaintive sweetness . &nbsp; WOMANOh , c'm on  --  come back ! . . . It 's lonely out there ! CUT TO : INT. /EXT . BERNZY 'S SEDAN/STREET - NIGHT Bernzy drives , his gaze unflagging . The Dispatcher monotonously intones a series of drab numbers on the hissing radio . CUT TO : INT . BERNZY 'S APARTMENT - DAY The police radio continues to hiss , O.S. , without interruption , as we pan Bernzy , asleep on top of his bed . He 's curled up in his clothes . Still panning , we see the apartment . It 's exceedingly cluttered  --  as unkempt and eccentric as its occupant . The shaes are drawn against daylight . On the crowded table Bernzy uses for a desk , there is a payroll check from Time , Inc. : TWO MURDERS . . . . . . $35.00 Pinned to the bulletin board over the desk , there are covers from the New York Daily News , Mirror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ featuring Bernzy 's photos of classic tabloid subjects : fires , corpses , handcuffed hoods.  --  12  --  Piled against a wall are two four-foot-tall stacks of cigar boxes with masking tape labels across their front flaps . These are makred with laundry pencil : " Vagrants , " " Drunks , " " Strippers , " " Rich &amp; Poor , " " Coney Island , " " Gangsters - Dead , " " Miscellaneous Crowds , " " Bowery - Night , " " Gagnsters - Live . " Still panning , we see a series of photos clothes-pinned to a laundry line . They show the Bum , sleeping in the box : he seems isolated and diminished in the high contrast of the Speed Graphic photo  --  a bright island in a sea of blackness . Pulling back from the photo we see the photos of the curled up bum in the foreground and Bernzy curled up on his bed in the near distance , the police radio on his nightstand . We begin to hear Big Band music over the hissing as we CUT TO : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Big Band music as we see a red awning lettered LOU LEVITZ 'S CAFE SOCIETY . It shows the club 's trademark since the 30 's : a squat coffee cup ( a remnant of Prohibition , when gin was served in the guise of legal beverages ) . On the sidewalk outside the polished revolving doors , there is a crush of out-of-towners who wait to enter , dressed in their best . But they 'll never be let in . A few Tabloid Photographers , behind a velvet rope , grip their big cameras , waiting for celebrities to come or go . One of them spots Bernzy as he threads his way through the crowd . &nbsp; PHOTOGRAPHERHey , Bernzy , y'just missed Eleanor Roosevelt French-kissin ' the Aga Kahn . &nbsp; BERNZY ( still moving ) I 'll catch ' em inside . &nbsp; PHOTOGRAPHERThat 'll be the day . Bernzy approaches the beefy Irish doorman , in red livery , who mans the ropes . &nbsp; DOORMANBehind the ropes , Bernstein . Bernzy parks his cigar in his mouth and extracts a piece of paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13  --  The Doorman reads a handwritten note on Lou Levitz 's personal stationery . In a woman 's hand : " Danny , Please direct Mr. Bernstein to my office , Mrs. Levitz . " As the Doorman reads , a patrician-looking Couple in evening clothes push their way to the front . &nbsp; DOORMANEvening , Mister-missus Armstrong . The Doorman lifts the rope . Mr. Armstrong slips him a bill as they pass through . Bernzy starts to follow , but the Doorman hooks the rope before he can pass . He looks over at the other Photographers , as he hands Bernzy back the note . &nbsp; DOORMANKitchen door . Check the camera . CUT TO : INT . CAFE SOCIETY - NIGHT The band music swells , O.S. , as the kitchen door swings open and a Waiter exits , tray in hand . It stays open as a Chinese Bus Boy points Bernzy in the direction of the hat check , across the front of the club . CAFE SOCIETY - HAT CHECK Bernzy , all eyes in this New York Mecca , takes up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SOCIETY - MAIN ROOM The big band plays on a bandstand , raised and set back from the tables . A black SINGER is performing , whose double entendres and risque stage manner lend a cultivated air of the illicit to things . In Cafe Society , as in The Stork Club or El Morocco , the seating arrangements clearly denote the " importance " of guests : The dreaded Outer Circle belongs to rich but garrulous businessmen with flashy dates or wives in furs . The Middle Circle is for show biz types , pretty women , professionals , the up-and-coming . The coveted Inner Circles comprises the well-born and the famous , e.g. , a red rose and a ceramic ashtray that says LOU LEVITZ 'S CAFE SOCIETY . Those who eat eat steaks or chops . Everyone drinks champagne or Scotch . Everyone smokes .  --  14  --  Bernzy 's eyes drink in the rich atmosphere . They seem to be taking photographs without benefit of a camera : DOYENNE WITH GIGOLO , FAT MAN OGLING CIGARETTE GIRL , ACTRESS IN SUNGLASSES , etc. , again through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The MAITRE D ' approaches Bernzy , intending to evict him ; his eyes scornfully size up Bernzy 's clothes , his overall demeanour . He has an Italian accent . &nbsp; MAITRE D' you have reservations , sir ? &nbsp; BERZNYI can see you got some . The Italian looks at him , utterly perplexed by the idiom . &nbsp; BERZNYForget it . Bernzy shows him the note from Kay . Recovering from his gaffe , the Maitre d ' bows his head graciously . He crosses to a section at the back of the room where The club 's Hostess  --  a beauty  --  is pointing out salient features of the room to a delegation of men in business suits ( not evening clothes . ) She charms them all with some witty remark . As they laugh , the Maitre d ' points out Bernzy . She excuses herself , crosses to Bernzy . She looks impossibly elegant next to him , or he looks impossibly unkempt next to her . &nbsp; KAYThanks for coming , Mr. Bernstein . &nbsp; BERNZYBernzy . KAY ( Mrs. Lou ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plucked from some show or chorus by her husband years ago , now groomed like a rich lady . Bernzy follows her toward a set of stairs at the back of the club . As they move , she looks across at the men in suits . &nbsp; KAYThose 're Publicity men from the War Department . They wan na shoot a newsreel in here for War Bonds .  --  15  --  INT . NIGHTCLUB OFFICE - SAME They enter . She closes the door behind them . The music is still audible from downstairs , but muted . A professional Hostess , in full control of her charm , she immediately crosses to a drinks caddy and pours him a Scotch . &nbsp; KAYThere 's never been a camera inside . Lou always said " It 's like Heaven , that way : they 're dyin ' to see it . " Bernzy smiles , but he looks ill-at-ease , holding his hat . The back wall of the office has a big curtained window that looks down on the nightclub . Memorabilia lines the other walls . Bernzy is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her show business days . He looks at a framed photo of Kay with the late Lou Levitz  --  squat , bald , nattily dressed . She hands him the Scotch and indicates the short couch . &nbsp; KAYPlease . He sits at one end . She sits at the other . The shabbiness of his clothes is especially apparant in these sleek surroundings . He 's still uncomfortable . It shows . &nbsp; KAYIs everything alright , Bernzy ? &nbsp; BERNZYI 'm still in shock . She does n't understand . . . &nbsp; BERNZYIf I 'd of snuck in , I 'd feel more comfortable . &nbsp; KAY ( a slow smile ) Me too . Half the people down there feel more sure they belong than I do . Now he smiles , half-disbelieving . He takes a cigar out of his pocket . &nbsp; BERNZYYou mind ?  --  16  --  &nbsp; KAY ( she shakes her head ) Lou told me you know everybody in New York , Bernzy : all the crooks and all the cops ... He shrugs modestly as he unwraps his cheap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because all you care about is getting pictures : taking sides might get in the way . Please  --  take one of Lou 's . They 're just going t'hell here . She opens a humidor on the coffee table and takes out a big Cuban . As she hands it to him , she seems to study him . &nbsp; BERNZYThanks . &nbsp; KAYI guess you 've read about Lou 's brother contesting the will . If Lou'd 've wanted to leave Cafe Society to a rug salesman , he 'd of left it to him . &nbsp; BERNZYHe sells toupees ? or carpets . &nbsp; KAYIt 's hard to tell . He smiles , she smiles ... She grows more serious . &nbsp; KAYPeople say some pretty lousy things about me , Bernzy : she 's a cold-hearted girl who married and buried an old man . You 've heard that ? Bernzy looks at her . He shrugs . &nbsp; KAYI loved my husband . I love this place . It 's mine now ... It 's mine . She seems to want some affirmation of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  --  17  --  She gets up abruptly and walks to the window overlooking the club . She draws back the curtain with her hand . &nbsp; KAYD'you know this man ? He joins her at the window . He looks down : A young , dark-faced Man , whose heavy , thuggish features contrast with the fine cut of his suit , sits at a table with a woman in decolette . They laugh in an ugly way . &nbsp; BERNZYNever saw him . I 'd take a stab in the dark he ai n't Society League . On the desk blotter , Kay finds a legal paper , then comes back to the window . &nbsp; KAYHe says he was my husband 's partner . She hands him the pages . A vulgar , gilt embossed business card is clipped to the top page with a name  --  EMILIO PORTIFINO  --  and an East Side address . &nbsp; KAYHe says Lou owed him money , and now he 's my partner . &nbsp; BERNZYNever heard of him . &nbsp; KAY ( disappointed ) No ? ... Bernzy shakes his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BERNZY ( examining the pages ) Offered as collateral in exchange for services rendered. &nbsp; KAY --  and he did n't keep secrets from me . &nbsp; BERNZYHow would you know ?  --  18  --  &nbsp; KAYHm ? &nbsp; BERNZYI mean if they 're secrets . He smiles . &nbsp; KAYYou know how it is  --  when you 're intimate with someone . Bernzy 's smile freezes ; he does n't know . &nbsp; BERZNYYeah , right . &nbsp; KAYI know Lou bootlegged in the old days . Who did n't ? And I know every booking agent who comes in here is n't strictly on the up and up . But Lou was a reputable businessman . &nbsp; BERNZYThis is his signature ? She nods . She looks out the window , again , at Portifino . &nbsp; KAYHe 's here every night , not ten feet from the Governor or Walter Winchell . &nbsp; BERNZYCould n't you just  --  ? &nbsp; KAYThrow him out ? I want to . But he says he 'll go to my brother-in-law , and help him prove Lou 's will is invalid . &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a second wife , there are n't any women in this business , and we both know what people say about me . I ca n't take the chance . As she looks out the window , staring at Portifino , she bites her lip , fretfully  --  nothing like the cool elegant hostess she was  --  19  --  on the floor of the club . This unnerves Bernzy . If she 's just acting ( vulnerable ) she 's doing a good job . &nbsp; BERNZY ( clearing his throat ) I could find out who he is . She takes his hand in hers . &nbsp; KAYPlease . He looks at his hand in hers . Either feeling that she is being over-emotional , or sensing he is uncomfortable being touched , she lets go of him , grows more matter-of-fact . &nbsp; KAYI really do n't know what 's appropriate , but I 'd like to pay you someth  --  &nbsp; BERNZYNo . &nbsp; KAYI just thought  --  He shakes his head . A beat . &nbsp; BERNZYDanny , downstairs , suggested I come in through the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doorman insisted : anybody could . &nbsp; KAYI 'm sorry . I 'll talk to him about it ... He nods . This does n't seem like quite enough . &nbsp; KAYWhy do n't you stay and have dinner ? She indicates the club , below . &nbsp; BERNZYIt 's alright . ( he smiles , starts to exit ) It ai n't that big a favor . &nbsp; KAYNext time , then .  --  20  --  &nbsp; BERNZY ( as he goes out ) Yeah , right . CUT TO : CAFE SOCIETY - MAIN FLOOR - LATER Bernzy , rather amazed , wearing a half-smile , stands waiting for his camera at the hat-check , looking out over the club . He looks up to the office window where Kay stands , looking down , smoking unhappily . Bernzy 's smile fades : he 's enjoying this too much . CUT TO : &nbsp; pp. 21-38 EXT. /INT . BERNZY 'S SEDAN/N .

He holds a furled newspaper under his arm . &nbsp; HAYWARDBernzy ! Just coming to see you . &nbsp; BERNZYI 'm late . Walk with me . &nbsp; HAYWARDWhat 's with the tie ? Somebody die ? &nbsp; BERNZYNot yet . Hayward unfurls the newspaper , a Daily Mirror . The banner headline ( no photo ) reads : KILL MOTHER IN JERSEY WITH AX . &nbsp; HAYWARDSeen this ? &nbsp; BERNZYYour work ? &nbsp; HAYWARDCame off the wires . Couple of seventeen-year-old kids in Greenport , New Jersey . They 're screwing in the girl 's mother 's kitchen , when who should walk in but mom .

ANTEROOM - RINEMAN PUBLISHING - SAME Bernzy gives his name to a RECEPTIONIST . &nbsp; RECEPTIONISTIs it a pick-up or a delivery ? &nbsp; BERNZY ( put out ) I have an appointment .

Bernzy seems to know the same door is going to open again . It does . H.R. RINEMAN appears , an athetically vigorous 60 year old . &nbsp; RINEMANMr . Bernstein ? INT . RINEMAN 'S OFFICE - LATER Rineman leads Bernzy into his book-lined office : all dark wood and rich leather .  --  24  --  &nbsp; RINEMANNow does one call you Mr. Bernstein or Mr. Bernzini ? Or is it just Bernzini ? &nbsp; BERNZYI was born Leon Bernstein . But I got the name The Great Bernzini from the gals at World-wide , the big photo agency ? They said I had t'be a magician to get to so many disasters so fast . &nbsp; RINEMANThat 's marvelous . He shows Bernzy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he takes his own seat , behind it . &nbsp; RINEMANI know my son spoke to you optimistically about publishing your book . That 's why he wanted me  --  why I wanted to speak to you rather than tossing it back into the mail . Bernzy 's eyes narrow almost imperceptibly but with a kind of anger : he 's suffered this particular humiliation before . Bernzy 's book is on Rineman 's desk . It 's a " dummy book "  --  a manuscript made up of stiff pieces of paper onto which photographs , printed on good paper , have been glued , along with captions . The book lies open to a photograph of a black man with an agonized expression , a fire-truck behind him , his face lighted by the unseen flames of his tenement afire . &nbsp; RINEMANOf course , from a technical point of view , this is fine work , fine work . It 's simply that we do n't publish books of this type . &nbsp; BERNZYListen , Mr. Rineman , please do n't hand me that  --  please  --  ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than anybody else .  --  25  --  &nbsp; RINEMAN ( ever gracious ) Well , sir , we publish books of photography . And to my mind , this is instead a most admirable picture book about New York . Not an inferior genre , just different . &nbsp; BERNZYNo . You 're wrong . This is a book of photography . &nbsp; RINEMANIf I may explain  --  &nbsp; BERNZYI know what you mean . Still lifes , naked women gettin ' out of bath-tubs , fruit on a plate  --  it 's a photo , but let 's pretend it 's a painting . We now see a row of tasteful framed photos on the wall behind Rineman , in precisely the style Bernzy describes . They include a woman getting out of her bath and fruit on a plate . &nbsp; BERNZYI know how to do that , too . I really do . But let 's face it , you publish enough of them books already . Everybody does . C'm on , Mr. Rineman : show those other guys . This is the book . Bernzy winks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hides it . &nbsp; RINEMANMay I say you 're not being fair to the photographers we do publish  --  Dick Arlen , Harold Briley , Val Armbruster . &nbsp; BERNZYI 'm sure they 're nice guys , but those arty-farty shots are easy to get compared to something like this ( he leans over , points to the open book , feature by feature )  --  where you got a big shiny fire truck in front of you , and a whole building on fire behind you , so the light 's every which way , and mean-time , this poor son-of-a-bitch is watching his life go up  --   --  26  --  &nbsp; RINEMANReally , I do n't doubt the difficulties you must 've faced ... You 're technically superb . &nbsp; BERNZYRight . &nbsp; RINEMAN ( hiding his distaste again ) But what I see here is a batch of pictures that 's too  --  sensational and too  --  vulgar to justify printing a fine book of photography , which is an expensive thing to do . &nbsp; BERNZYWhat 's vulgar , exactly ? This guy ? or the fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd like to suggest that you apply it to a subject matter that  --  &nbsp; BERNZYNo  --  huh-nh , no . &nbsp; RINEMAN ( finally letting his impatience show ) Please listen , Mr. Bernstein  --  ! &nbsp; BERNZYDo n't you think I heard this advice before ? I just happen to be right about all this , see ? Do n't you think I 'd rather be shooting flowers or beatiful dames than campin ' out with corpses ? &nbsp; RINEMANMaybe you should ask yourself . Sensationalism has its allure . It 's potent . It can desensitize a man to the beauty of flowers  --  or women . &nbsp; BERNZYWhat 're you , a shrink ? &nbsp; RINEMANHardly . But the men who do what you do do n't usually feel the need to rationalize it like you  --   --  27  --  &nbsp; RINEMAN ( Cont 'd ) much less be celebrated for it . &nbsp; BERNZYNobody does what I do . Bernzy takes up the book as Rineman watches . He moves to the door , seizes the knob , but pauses . &nbsp; BERNZYI figure your boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wo n't hold this against him when I have my big retrospective over at the modern art museum . &nbsp; RINEMAN ( his interest piqued , now ) You 're having a show at the Museum of Modern Art ? &nbsp; BERNZYSomeday . &nbsp; RINEMAN ( a thin smile ) Oh ... ( his certitude restored ) If you really disdain the publishing establishment so , why do you crave its acceptance ? &nbsp; BERNZYWho the hell else is gon na publish a book ? He slams the door behind him . CUT TO : Section Details INT . POLICE STATION - NIGHT A door opens and a dozen flashbulbs blaze as a young HOOD , handcuffed to a Cop , enters the room . However , the Hood is covering his face with his unchained hand , so nobody gets a shot .

He looks over at the snarling , defiant Hood . &nbsp; SGT.I do n't think he wants it took . &nbsp; BERNZY ( taking up his camera ) Everybody likes to have his picture took . Bernzy approaches the Hood , whose handcuffs have been removed so that he may be fingerprinted .

But it is Porfitino who lies dead by the door .  --  31  --  He is tangled in piano wire .

I was just calling on him as a favor to a friend . &nbsp; CHADWICKRight . What did you say your friend 's name was ? &nbsp; BERNZYI did n't say . Chadwick waits a beat : Bernzy offers nothing . &nbsp; BERNZYWhat 're you investigating here , anyway ? I mean , what was this guy  --  &nbsp; CHADWICKDid your friend have business dealings with Portifino . &nbsp; BERNZYNo . &nbsp; CHADWICKDetective Conklin tells us you know many members of the mob in New York . &nbsp; BERNZYI also know a lot of cops and wash-room attendants . It 's the only way a photographer stays in business . I mean a tabloid photographer , not a Steiglitz or a Steichen . &nbsp; YOUNG AGENT ( for his notes ) Excuse me .

You were hoping to get money from Portifino , is that right ? &nbsp; BERNZYWhat ?  --  37  --  &nbsp; CHADWICKYou intended to blackmail him . &nbsp; BERNZYThis is a joke .

Bernstein , you came to this country from Russia when you were six years old . &nbsp; BERNZY ( getting up , putting on his hat ) Alright , that 's it . I got my cell meeting in half an hour . He reaches for his exposed film plates on the desk . But Chadwick traps his hand there . &nbsp; CHADWICKWhere you going ? How d' you know you 're not a suspect in the murder of Emilio Portifino ? &nbsp; BERNZYThis is the stupidest interrogation I 've ever seen . You 're telling me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this guy got rich quick doing something the Feds do n't like . Already I can see you 're tryin ' to keep it quiet , and when you bring up Russia , I figure it 's something treasonous . Chadwick begins to speak , but the Older Agent  --  alarmed by Bernzy 's perspicacity  --  takes over . &nbsp; OLDER AGENTMr . Bernstein , thanks for your cooperation . We 're sorry if we 've taken you away from your work . This is a time of war , and we hope you 'll keep your conjectures about Mr. Portifino to yourself . Fact is , we know nothing about the man , and hoped perhaps you did . Bernzy does n't believe the last part , but keeps it to himself . &nbsp; BERNZYYeah , okay .

Then why 'd you call the Feds ? &nbsp; BERNZYI did n't . &nbsp; FARINELLIYou did n't . &nbsp; BERNZYI found the body . Not the first I ever found . I called the cops , like I always do . They called the F.B.I . Annoyed , Farinelli turns to his lieutenants , speaks in Italian . After a brief tirade , he turns back to Bernzy . &nbsp; FARINELLIOkay , so you did n't call the Feds , we was misinformed by a police stooge . I 'd still like to know how you knew Portifino @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hood returns with coffee from someplace outside . But Farinelli , annoyed by now , directs him to put it on a side table ( instead of giving it to Bernzy ) . &nbsp; FARINELLIYou did n't , not really . . . Then what were you doin ' in his apartment , if I may ask ? Bernzy studies Farinelli a beat before answering . He can see how agitated Farinelli is about all of this . &nbsp; BERNZYI met him the other night . At Cafe Society . He said he needed somebody to take his picture . He offered good money . &nbsp; FARINELLIYou do n't do commissions . I offered you plenty when my sister 's boy took communion two years ago .  --  41  --  Close on Bernzy , caught in a lie . &nbsp; BERNZYThat 's right , I do n't . Do commissions .

So that 's all there is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next to his seat , looms over him , smiling . But his face turns fierce as Farinelli kicks the chair out from under Bernzy , who flops onto his back and hits his head on the tiles . Bernzy lies on the floor , more stunned and humiliated than hurt , and looks up at the half-circle formed around him by Farinelli and his thugs . Bernzy stares up at Farinelli . He raises his right hand to God . After a long beat , Farinelli extends his hand , to help him up . &nbsp; FARINELLIOkay , Bernzy . As it is , I got ta trust you . You never crossed nobody , got no interest in dough , do nothin ' but take pictures , noon and night . He circles his arm around Bernzy , and walks him to the door . &nbsp; FARINELLIWhat is it with you , anyway ? Dope fiends live better than you do .

Nabler drains his Scotch . &nbsp; BERNZYUntrue . . . I never read ' em . But Nabler 's mood is turning sour as his high winds down .

Eager to escape , Bernzy tries to wrest his hand away .

No woman could ever love a shabby little guy who sleeps in his clothes and eats outta cans and cozies up to corpses so much he starts to stink like one .

DINING ROOM Spoleto 's men are arrayed ( weapons aimed ) on either side of the table , i.e. , looking across the table , not toward the kitchen and not toward the street .

Bernzy kneels behind the table set against the wall outside next to the hallway  --  the one he moved earlier . Bernzy kicks the time-release camera : it slides out toward the side wall , aimed upward at the killers and ticking down . The scene is sensational , nearly surreal , with bright lights flaring in every direction . . . spent shells bouncing off the ground . . . food , wine and blood spattering onto the white table-cloths . Bernzy stands for his second shot as The Assassin opens fire on Farinelli 's bodyguard , who has managed to pull his gun . Then he spots Bernzy . Bernzy 's camera is aimed at the Assassin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bernzy continues to shoot . Through Bernzy 's viewfinder , we see what he 's seeing : his own murder . Just before the Assassin pulls the trigger , one of Farinelli 's Men , who has managed to pull his gun , shoots him . Bernzy , seemingly impervious ( or possessed ) is already advancing the film . Bernzy is only partly hidden by the table and its overhanging cloth : his feet show , he must stand half-erect every time he takes a picture . We feel is protected not by the table as much as by his single-mindedness : he is an appendage of the camera . A bullet tears into the lip or leg of the table Bernzy uses for cover . There is a violent shudder . He is not sure , and we are not sure , if he has been hit by a bullet , or stung by the table itself . He just keeps shooting pictures . By now there is a horrible litter of wood , cloth , food , blood and corpses on the floor . ON the time-release @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at five seconds , as it was at Bernzy 's apartment . The Lead Assassin gives the signal . The shooting ends as abruptly as it began . Farinelli and all his men are dead . They leave by the front door . But the last Gunman to leave looks curiously over his shoulder , as if he hinks he saw something . Then he hurries off , to catch up with the others .  --  99  --  EXT .

DINING ROOM Bernzy rises unsteadily to his feet . He winces , but whether he is wounded , or merely reacting to the devestation around him , we still do n't know . He cocks his ear as he judges how far off the sirens are , i.e. , how much time does he have . He begins to take pictures of the massacre 's aftermath . Hearing someone crunch over glass , he looks up . The curious Gunman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gunman raises a pistol . A distinctive noise is heard from the side of the room : ki-ki-ki-ki-ki-click . The Gunman swings around , thinking it is one of Farinelli 's men , wounded but not dead . As he fires into a corpse  --  Bernzy makes a run for the back hallway . The Gunman whirls around again , to fire at Bernzy , but Bernzy 's gone . As the sirens draw very close now , the Gunman flees by the front door . EXT .

The table is packed with law enforcement personnel , mostly in suits .

Somebody 's yawning . Time has passed . &nbsp; CHADWICK ( to a D.A. ) Read him the statues about with-holding evidence again .

The Chief and his Assistant deal the newspapers onto the big table . As they hit the table , and various people sieze them eagerly , we cut from tabloid cover to tabloid cover . All of them carry full size front page photos of the shooting . The pictures are grainy , owing to the infra-red film , but this gives them an even more nightmarish aspect . The rigidly set faces of the killers are plainly visible . The bullets flaring from the gun barrels are seen like streaks of light . One tabloid shows a mesmerizing shot of the murdered Assassin staring straight at the camera , when he had a bead on Bernzy . Others show the staggered , falling , or crumpled bodies of the victims .  --  104  --  At least two tabloid have the fortuitous shot ( taken by the late-functioning timer camera ) of the Curious Gunman shooting Bernzy : the Gunman is in the foreground , with his back to us , his shooting arm extended , his hand and gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waits for the trigger to be pulled .

Another tabloid splits the page between two photos  --  Thatcher White  --  HE SOLD OUT GI JOE  --  and Bernzy  --  HE SAVED HIM !

There are dozens upon dozens of Reporters and Photographers . The Reporters shout for Bernzy 's attention and the Photographers take a never-ending series of flash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bernzy , or autograph books , or copies of Life Magazine . Grinning Teenagers and Mothers of G.I. 's just want to touch him . Bernzy , in his street clothes and ostensibly recovered , is emotionally muted , without his usual quick eyes , purposeful movements , rapid steps . He offers an occasional wave , or a tepid smile , but he seems totally overwhelmed . As they descend the crowded stairs , a 60ish , well-dressed , Man in the crowd is more or less pulled into their immediate orbit by Nabler . Nabler shouts ; he has to . &nbsp; NABLERBernzy , meet my publisher , the eminent Albert Gerard . &nbsp; GERARDMr .

Bernzy moves along automatically , buffeted along by the crowd : people extend their hands , poke their smiling faces in front of him . &nbsp; NABLERSo  --  can we agree to this deal in principle . &nbsp; GERARDWe have the greatest enthusiasm . &nbsp; BERNZYRight . &nbsp; GERARDAre you okay ? &nbsp; BERNZYDo n't like to have my picture took . &nbsp; NABLERMr .

As Photographers run alongside the car to poke their cameras at the windows , as teenagers chase after the car , as the grim-faced Policemen try to guide the car through the morass of humanity , as an Older Woman begins to cry , it is a series of Bernzy-like tableaux , the silent images filled in only with the hiss of the radio .
