<p> DENVER  --  The liver cancer was extremely rare . You could put 100 cancer patients in a room and not find this disease . Hepatocellular carcinoma , it was called . A big name . <p> Jim White only knew it as the thing that was killing him . <p> It was August 1981 , five years after his NFL career had dried up in Denver , and White thought his only connection to football was a lot of memories and a few aches and pains . But the connection apparently was much more real . <p> The doctors at University Hospital were asking him questions . <p> Hepatocellular carcinoma normally is related to three things , they told him . <p> Did he have an alcohol problem ? He said he rarely drank . <p> Had he ever had hepatitis ? Never . <p> Had he ever used anabolic steroids ? <p> A pause . <p> Then : For at least eight years , from his days as a standout defensive lineman at Colorado State University through a six-year NFL career , he had used them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of liver cancer , his story is only recently coming to light . He is the first NFL player known to have died from a cancer closely linked with steroid abuse . His family hopes White 's death will show athletes dabbling with steroids that there can be a serious price to pay . <p> Although doctors are suspicious that steroids and other muscle enhancers led to the death of former Broncos and Raiders defensive lineman Lyle Alzado in 1992 , they have no direct proof . <p> White 's case seems to have a much clearer connection , doctors say . Years ago , the link between hepatocellular carcinoma and steroids became apparent when patients suffering from aplastic anemia were being diagnosed with the rare liver cancer . <p> They had been taking anabolic steroids to help raise their red blood cell counts . <p> " " Jim White either had liver cancer due to steroids or liver cancer due to bad luck , " said Dr. Alan Rosenberger , who was a resident at University Hospital and helped treat White . " " It 's tough to say he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , Jim White is what his friends and family always knew he was : a big name . <p> " " Football was the greatest thing in his life , " said his mother , Connie , who lives in Chicago . " " From grammar school up , that 's all he went out for . He just loved it . It would n't surprise me ( that he took steroids ) because that 's what he wanted , to play football . I guess someone told him that they would make him stronger , if he would take it . " <p> Sitting in his bed at University Hospital , White told Rosenberger his philosophy on steroids : " " If you want to be a lineman , you 've got to be big . " <p> White was big . He stood 6-4 and weighed 275 pounds . <p> Rosenberger remembers thinking White 's frame should have carried about 225 pounds . <p> White 's case bounced around the medical community for years , but it was n't until a doctor doing research called the White family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connection . <p> " " We had no idea , " said Marva White-Neal , White 's sister . <p> " " Deep in the back of my mind , it 's what I always expected because my brother was not the type to do drugs . He did n't smoke . <p> " " I asked him once , " How do you really feel about playing pro ball ? ' He said , " It 's all a money-making business . They do n't really care about us . We can get hurt really bad , and they 'll give us some shots and send us back on the field to play . ' He said he was really tired of it . He did n't tell us what type of shots these were . <p> " " I did n't know that much about steroids , but after I learned about them , I thought that must have been what he was talking about . I do n't even think he was aware fully of what steroids were . " <p> Rosenberger and others in the medical community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the effects of long-term steroid abuse . But they believe it to be true . <p> " " The direct comeback is , " You 've got no proof , " ' Rosenberger said . " " The answer is , " They 're right , we do n't have any proof . ' We do n't even have the kind of proof you 'd like to have with a cigarette , where you 've you 've got 400,000 cases a year . <p> This is one case and one guy who might have had bad luck . And Lyle Alzado might have been one case of one guy who had bad luck . But it seems the linemen in the NFL who used steroids have more bad luck as they get older than other people . <p> " " In the scientific community , there is no proof . This is all supposition . But it 's supposition that 's fairly strong . " <p> Dr. Rob Huizenga , formerly the Raiders team doctor , said White 's case is another strong reason for conducting a study of former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NFL declined to recommend him for a government grant to study the problem . <p> " " I think there 's a strong causal link between anabolic steroids and hepatocellular carcinoma , " he said . " " There has been no link between the rare brain lymphoma Lyle had and anabolic steroids . It 's never been studied . The lack of proof does not mean that there 's a lack of connection . It just means we have n't studied it . " <p> They were as close as brothers . <p> " " Two peas in a pod , " Johnny Allen said . <p> So when Allen , White 's teammate at CSU , is told his best friend used steroids , it sounds all wrong . Ca n't be . The man he remembers was a natural . The man he remembers ran the 40-yard dash in 4.5 seconds . The man he remembers was chosen by the New England Patriots in the third round of the 1972 draft simply because he was good . <p> The man he remembers was strong and quick . Strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strong and fast enough that he blurred through Northeastern Junior College , through Colorado State , through a year in the Canadian Football League , through stops with the Patriots , the Houston Oilers , the Seattle Seahawks and the Broncos . <p> But Allen wonders now . White had a huge falling out with then-Patriots coach Chuck Fairbanks and was released . He played two years with Houston , then got into a fight and was waived the next day . Even though Allen remembers White as very even-tempered , he has heard about the steroid rages users sometimes have . Was that it ? <p> White was extremely private , to the point of telling almost no one about his cancer . Allen found out White was dying in University Hospital only through a friend of a friend , a sheer coincidence . White 's family found out the day before he died and flew to Denver . <p> It makes sense the private man never shared knowledge of his steroid use with anyone until he was staring at death at 31 . <p> Hearing the possible steroid connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it does n't make it easier . <p> " " It 's totally out of the blue , " he said . <p> Doctors and researchers say that only a steroids-related death will have an effect on some users . And absolutely no effect on others . <p> " " People will say , " Despite you telling me that this is going to kill me , I 'm still alive , " ' said Wade Exum , chairman of the U.S. Olympic Committee'sDrug Control Administration . " " " Despite you telling me this is going to make my testicles shrink , they have n't shrunk . You 're telling me it 's going to make me bald , I 'm not bald . <p> You 're telling me it 's going to make me grow breasts , I do n't have breasts . ' <p> " " I think athletes are like adolescents . They come back and say , " You told me it was black , and see here , it 's blue . " ' White 's life has been dusted off and held up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see it ? <p> " " Using steroids is like playing with fire , " Rosenberger said . " " I 'm not sure that you can tell kids who are doing steroids what the effects might be later on . We can tell them about the joint problems and all the other things , but I 'm not sure they listen . But when we can say , " You may end up dying or it can shorten your life , ' then maybe it can make a difference . "
