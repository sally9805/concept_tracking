John-John had been saving dollar bills toward a dream and when he had a shoebox full of bills he sat down to count out his future . " One , two , three , " he counted , all the way up to ten to make a neat stack on the floor and soon , he had two hundred neat stacks in exact rows and columns . <p> How much is enough ? <p> John-John packed a suitcase with his dollar bills , a change of underwear , a toothbrush , and a photograph of his older brother , Joseph . The photograph was folded , spindled , mutilated . Joseph , the jet pilot , sat in full military dress in front of an American flag . <p> Dear Mr. and Mrs.  --  , we regret to inform you that your son ,  --  , was shot down and taken prisoner by the enemy during a routine military operation . At this time , we are doing everything within our power to assure the immediate and safe release of your son . <p> Sincerely , they said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four walls and one window of the HUD house on the reservation . So , most Indians had no job and they counted change to buy the next bottle of wine . Maybe the wells went dry every summer and maybe any water still left was too radioactive to drink . <p> " Uranium has a half-life of one hundred thirty-five million years , " somebody told Joseph , and he said , " Shit , I can tell you stories that will last longer than that . " <p> Then , there was music . <p> Joseph sang in a voice so pure even the drunkest Indians threw their bottles down . He sang in a voice so sharp even the oldest Indians could hear him dearly . He sang in a voice so deep even the whitest Indians remembered the words . <p> Sometimes , he danced . <p> Joseph had big feet and he stumbled , often lost the rhythm of drums . But he smiled and picked himself up from the ground after he fell . He whistled . He slapped his thighs . He crow-hopped and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rent . <p> After Joseph was taken prisoner of war , John-John waited at the window for years . He ate and drank at that window ; he slept with his eyes open . John-John 's friends grew up , graduated or dropped out of school , married , had children , got drunk too much , but he stood there at the window and waited . <p> John-John remembered : the sky and ground disappeared into the horizon , that imaginary line forever rolling away . Snow . Ice . Cold wind . Joseph in blue parka and military surplus boots . After Christmas but before New Year 's Eve . Everyone was sober . Standing in some anonymous field while his Chevy sat a few feet away on the other side of a fence , Joseph raised his arms and said , Someday , the world will be mine . Maybe he just said , Goddamn , I need a drink . Joseph had already dug through the ashtray , in the glove compartment , under seats . There was no money left in the world . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm out of miracles , Joseph said and walked fifteen miles for help . <p> Now , John-John stood on the front porch with his suitcase , a key hanging on a string around his neck . No lock , no door . The key was just a small mystery . It did n't fit any lock on the reservation . Maybe it opened a garage door in Seattle ; maybe it started a car in Spokane . <p> John-John watched the sky for signs , read the sun for the correct time , and checked his watch to be sure . It 's time to go , he thought just as the jet ripped through the sound barrier and shook the air . John-John tumbled down the stairs , landed on his tailbone . He stood up , rubbed his ass , and searched the sky for evidence . He could see vapor trails stretched across the sky . <p> John-John ran for the football field , down the reservation high-way , three miles of smooth , smooth pavement . It happens that way : the tribe had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the reservation still lived on commodities . But John-John ran until his chest hurt and legs trembled . He ran to the ends of the highway and stared back toward his house , at the jet approaching , then landing with a concussion of noise . <p> The jet taxied down the highway , turbines slowing , and came to a stop a few feet from John-John . Power . Heat . Noise . It all felt and sounded like possibilities ; it was the machinery of dreams . John-John stared at the jet until it grew beyond his vision . His eyes watered , ached . He rubbed at them with fists until they grew out of proportion . Minutes went by until the jet was silent in the silence its arrival created . <p> Has Christopher Columbus come back ? <p> John-John walked toward the jet , slowly , carefully . His steps were measured and precise . Step on a crack , break your mother 's back . A balance beam is only four inches wide ; the reservation is only half that width . John-John reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cold . He jumped back as the cockpit opened and a voice called out . <p> " Sir , ace jet pilot Joseph Victor , code name Geronimo , reporting for duty , sir ! " <p> A tall man climbed down from the cockpit and stood at attention . His unbraided hair fell out from under his flight helmet , reached down to the small of his back . The tall man saluted John-John then wheeled and saluted the crowd of Indians quickly gathering . He turned back to John-John . <p> " Sir , may I have permission to remove my helmet , sir ? " <p> John-John was stunned . He raised his arm in a half-salute , the heels of his tennis shoes clicked together . <p> " Joseph , is that you ? " <p> " Sir , yes , sir . May I please remove my helmet , sir ? " <p> " Yeah , go ahead . " <p> Joseph removed his helmet , leaned it against a hip , still at attention . His face was scarred , battered . The purple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the symmetrical scars up and down his cheeks looked like gills . <p> " Joseph , your face . What happened ? " <p> John-John moved doser to his brother , reached out and touched the scars , the skin . Hot and cold . Both close to tears . <p> " Sir , it 's been a long and glorious war but I am happy to be home , sir . " <p> " But , your face . What did they do to you ? " <p> " Sir , I am proud to say I withstood their tortures with courage and strength . I only gave them my name , rank , and serial number , sir . " <p> John-John cried then , took his brother 's hand . Swollen and scratched , Joseph 's hand felt like fear and failure . He had lost his left ring finger , his nails were torn , some missing altogether . Crude initials were carved into his palms . <p> " Joseph , do n't you recognize me ? It 's your brother , John-John . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He saw those eyes curved like a bow , colored like the center of the earth ; that hair short and still untamed , black ; that mouth , too small for the face , those teeth yellowed and healthy ; those hands , that hand now holding his , so long and forgiving , skin like a woman 's . <p> Who are you ? Who are you ? <p> " Sir , I do n't remember . I 'm sorry . I just do n't remember , sir . " <p> Memory , like a coin trick , like the French drop with one hand passing over the other , quarter dropping into sight , then out of existence . It was there ! It was there ! The little Indian boys screaming at the sudden recognition of their first metaphor . Memory like an abandoned car , rusting and forgotten though it sits in plain view for decades . Dogs have litters there ; generations of spiders live a terrible history . All of it goes unnoticed and no one bothers to tell the story . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he falls asleep . In his story , Joseph comes back on a bus , on a train , hitchhiking . In his story , Joseph 's feet never leave the ground again . But that kind of vision is costly ; it rips sweat from John-John 's sleep and skin . He wakes up with a thirst so large that nothing can be forgiven . He wakes up with the sound of Joseph 's voice in his nose . Reverberation . <p> " Hey , John-John , why do you got two first names ? " <p> " Cuz you have to say anything twice to make it true ? " <p> " No , that ai n't it . " <p> " Cuz our parents really meant it when they named me ? " <p> " I do n't think so . " <p> " Maybe it 's just a memory device . " <p> " Who knows ? " <p> Joseph sitting at the kitchen table as they replay this conversation , this way of greeting , each day . Ever since John-John could form a sentence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hey , John-John , why do you got two first names ? " <p> " Cuz I 'm supposed to be twins ? " <p> " No , man , that 's too easy . " <p> " Cuz mother always had a stutter ? " <p> Laughter . Then , more laughter . Then , coffee and buttered toast . Sometimes , a day-old donut . The sun came in through the windows . It was there , just as much as the tablecloth or the salt and pepper shakers . <p> Hey , John-John , why do you got two first names ? <p> Now , John-John waiting at the window . Watching . Telling the glass his stories , whispering to the pane , his breath fogging the world . His house , his family 's house , closed in all around him . Too many photographs . Too many stray papers and tattered magazines . The carpet has fleas . <p> There have been smaller disasters . <p> Mother and father , sister and sister , rush , rush . Fumigate , bleach and vinegar in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The dog , lonely and confused , chained to a spare tire in the yard . <p> " John-John , " his mother says . " You have to leave . I mean , we all have to leave the house for a few hours . It 'll be toxic for a while , you know ? " <p> He is dragged from the window , sat down beside the dog on the lawn . They both howl . <p> Once , John-John dreamed of flight . He imagined a crazed run into the forest , into the pine . Maybe then they would search for him , search for Joseph out there in the dark . John-John wanted to build fires with no flame or smoke . He wanted to hide in the brush while searchers walked by , inches away , calling out his name . He wanted helicopters with spotlights , all-terrain vehicles , the local news . Together , they would lift stones and find Joseph ; they would shake trees and Joseph would fall to the ground ; they would drink Joseph from their canteens ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across snow , stunned by winter . The rescue team would find John-John and Joseph huddled together like old men , like children , like small birds tensing their bodies for flight . <p> John-John sits at his window . Waits . Watches . His face touches the glass . Hot and cold . His eyes follow the vapor trails that appear in the reservation sky . They are ordinary and magical . <p> Next time , John-John thinks . Next time , it will be Joseph . <p> Maybe it is winter again . Maybe it is just summer disguised . There is no one left to notice . Dust . Cold wind . Noise . John-John hears it all in his head . He counts his dollar bills , one , two three , all the way up to ten before he starts again . He waits ; he watches . <p> He wants to escape . <p> <p> By SHERMAN ALEXIE <p>
