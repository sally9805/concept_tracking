" A Tower of Babel " is what Health and Human Services Secretary Dr. Louis Sullivan calls the din surrounding U.S. food products . But if Americans are having trouble deciphering the language in food labels and advertising , just who or what is to blame ? The food industry likes to point the finger at the Federal Government 's regulatory swamp , while the government puts the onus on overzealous marketers . But in truth there is enough culpability for all . For years now , foodmakers and government regulators have been tangled up together in a web of sloppy practices and , above all , cozy politics . " Everything in nutrition is political , " declares Marion Nestle , who chairs the department of nutrition at New York University . <P> Part of the grocery garble stems from America 's hodgepodge system of food regulation . Three federal agencies have jurisdiction . The FDA oversees all items sold in supermarkets except for meat , poultry and any products that are more than 2% meat . These products are monitored instead by the U.S. Department of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bailiwick of the Federal Trade Commission . To see how muddled it gets , consider the case of frozen pizza . Cheese pizza and its packaging belongs to the FDA , while pepperoni pizza and its labeling rests with the USDA . The FTC approves ads for both . Contributing to the chaos : the agencies often do n't use the same rules , standards or even definitions in regulating food . <P> The influence of politics on food policy is most clearly visible at the Agriculture Department . Written into its charter is a conflict of interest wider than a side of beef . Unlike its sister regulatory agencies , the USDA is obliged to promote as well as police agricultural products . Nutritionists are quick to point out that the department is responsible for regulating most of the fattier  --  unhealthier  --  elements of the diet . But its mandate to promote the consumption of beef , pork , dairy products and eggs gets in the way of its concerns for American health . " There 's no David Kessler heading the USDA , and there never will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Center for Science in the Public Interest . <P> Instead there is Agriculture Secretary Edward Madigan , a former Congressman from the Illinois farm belt , whose commitment to food producers was clear almost as soon as he took office last March . <P> The most glaring example of this bias involves a foiled attempt to revise the USDA 's dietary guidelines . In 1958 the department introduced its " basic four " food-group chart , which divided food into four major categories : milk , meat , vegetables and fruits , and bread and cereals . The groups were quickly branded into the brain of every American schoolchild as of equal importance . <P> But as research into heart disease , cancer and nutrition proceeded over the past 35 years , the chart emerged as seriously misleading , more of a political construct than a guide to healthy eating . It overemphasizes meat and milk  --  a credit to the influence of those industries , whose lobbyists have been active and generous in Washington .                @ @ @ @ @
