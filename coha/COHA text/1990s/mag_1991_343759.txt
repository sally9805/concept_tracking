On May 1 , Chun Se Yong sounded like the last person who would set himself on fire as a political protest . Two university students had just immolated themselves to protest the beating to death of a student demonstrator by police on April 26 , but Chun , a 19-year-old sophomore at Kyungwon University , near Seoul , questioned the wisdom of adding to the growing list of martyrs , or yolsa ( Korean for honorable man of justice ) . " We need more dedicated fighters , not more yolsa , " the left-wing activist told colleagues at the campus newspaper . <P> But something changed for Chun in the next 48 hours . About 3 p.m. on May 3 , he walked out on a balcony near the university 's main entrance , doused himself with paint thinner , ignited himself with a cigarette lighter , and then plunged 15 ft. to the pavement below . Alive , but with burns covering 95% of his body , Chun was rushed to a hospital . Seven hours later , he died . <P> Since Chun 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ versions of the Molotov cocktails students throw with alarming regularity during South Korea 's annual spring demonstration season . Although the suicides have failed to produce the massive demonstrations that pushed the previous regime from power in 1987 , President Roh Tae Woo fired his hard-line Prime Minister last week and promised other reforms , hoping to end this season 's violence . But street clashes continued , killing one more person at week 's end . <P> With the exception of one or two unbalanced victims , the suicides have had the same motive : to galvanize demonstrators and rouse the general public to demand an end to what the students say are the injustices of the government of President Roh Tae Woo and of the corporate conglomerates that dominate the economy . The young political activists see themselves as the conscience of their nation . Enough reforms have occurred in the past four years to mollify much of the populace . That is the case with most students as well , and their apathy has frustrated radical activists , who have now turned to more desperate inspiration . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suicide is a mystery to those who knew him . Friends and colleagues describe him as an intense , articulate young man , well-versed in the rhetoric of his cause . Raised by his grandmother after his taxi-driver father and his mother divorced several years ago , Chun was sensitive to the social injustices he saw around him . <P> He was also susceptible to the ideological blandishments of the radical left when he entered the university . Korean high school students come from an intensive , hot-house education in which they are expected to memorize without question everything they are told . In college they often join informal study groups for camaraderie , but many of these are thinly disguised political- indoctrination cliques dominated by older , left-wing students . Untrained in critical thought , the young students are easily turned into ardent converts .
