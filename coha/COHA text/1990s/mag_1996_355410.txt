Ask an economic question about Bob Dole 's tax-cut proposal , and campaign advisers are happy to give a political answer . For instance , Why did Dole make a 15% slash in individual income-tax rates the centerpiece of his economic program rather than feature a more complex , rival alternative ? Because it 's easier to explain to voters , says Michigan Republican Senator Spencer Abraham , who helped sell Dole on the idea . Whatever the economic merits of the other plan , " people would have to think about their adjusted gross income and payroll tax . The concept does n't translate to everyone . " <P> And getting people not to think might be helpful , particularly since some of Dole 's numbers do not seem to add up . No matter , say campaign aides ; he 's running for President , not accountant in chief . Besides , adds Donald Rumsfeld , a senior policy adviser , the Republican nominee is not talking to economists : " The real audience here is the American people . " Rumsfeld figures they are ripe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Governors Christie Whitman in New Jersey and John Engler in Michigan , it is a debate Republicans can win , " he says . <P> All of which points to the prime difficulty of offering an economic critique of the tax plan Dole finally unveiled last week : it is not really an economic program at all . The plan 's true purpose is to bait enough voters with the promise of lower tax bills so as to overcome President Clinton 's towering lead in the polls . <P> Is that still possible ? Dole 's advisers talk up voters ' lingering doubts about Clinton 's credibility . But the Republican hopeful could be creating a credibility chasm of his own . His proposed tax cuts are so enormous  --  $551 billion over six years , according to the nonpartisan Joint Tax Committee  --  as to leave him wide open to charges that they will cause the federal deficit to balloon . And thanks in no small part to the decades-long preaching of a former Senator named Robert J. Dole , polls lately indicate the public prefers lower deficits to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Convention delegates . Some 1,000 of them , polled for TIME and CNN by Yankelovitch Partners Inc. , rated deficit cutting " more important " than tax reduction , 47% to 41% . <P> Dole insists he can balance the budget by 2002 through a combination of economic growth  --  to be spurred by the tax cuts  --  and sharp , though mostly unspecified , reductions in spending . Trust me , he is saying . He told the Chicago Chamber of Commerce , " I grew up a poor boy in Russell , Kansas . I know the importance of living within your means , and I know the consequences of not doing that . Deficit reduction is in my blood . " <P> The promise was not enough to convince skeptics , even on traditionally Republican Wall Street . Says Stephen Roach , chief economist for Morgan Stanley : " There is not one shred of credible evidence on how Dole will pay for his plan . Fully 65% of the revenue breaks are to be financed by nothing more than wishful thinking . This is as vague as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
