What worries mutual fund managers should worry you . A look inside the high-pressure culture of Middle America 's most popular investment <p> Once , not so very long ago , it was all so simple . Was it really only two decades ago that most Americans put their savings in the bank , ( where the interest was regulated by law ) , had checking accounts that offered no interest at all , took out a 30-year fixed mortgage when the time came to buy a house  --  and then paid that mortgage off !  --  and , if they were in the stock market at all ( and most were n't ) , they owned a few , inherited shames of , say , General Motors ? It seems more like two centuries ago , does n't it ? <p> American financial life is infinitely more complicated than it used to be  --  and riskier in every way . We now worry endlessly about an entire slice of life that we used to take for granted . Are interest rates poised to rise or drop ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my portfolio be ? How aggressive should I be with my retirement money ? For better or worse , these are the sorts of questions that one hears all the time now . <p> One can trace this quantum change back to the days of roaring inflation in the late seventies  --  when interest rates were skyrocketing , 30-year fixed mortgages became relics of a bygone era , and people were desperate to find ways to keep pace with the cost of living . But even after inflation faded in the early 1980s , the new behaviors stayed ; if anything , they became more pronounced , especially once the bull market began in August 1982 . That was the moment when many people felt they had to become investors rather than simply savers . <p> And if there is any single financial product that exemplifies this shift , it is the mutual fund . Once an obscure investment instrument , mutual funds have become the financial vehicle of choice among middle-class Americans . Over 40 million people had put an astonishing $2.1 trillion in mutual funds by the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the previous three years  --  and fund assets now actually exceed life insurance assets . <p> It 's not hard to understand the appeal of mutual funds . For most of us who lack the time or the inclination to study the stock market , there is something comforting about the notion that a professional fund manager is , in essence , making decisions on our behalf . The diversification of stocks in the funds would reduce risks ( though of course the risks are scarcely eliminated ) , and the small army of stock researchers at the fund companies would help the fund managers make money with our assets . These were always the central ideas behind the funds  --  ultimately they were supposed to offer a simpler means of investing than scouting out stocks ourselves . And yet here we stand today , with more than 5,000 mutual funds being marketed as fund companies and magazines covering the funds clamor for our attention . Choosing a mutual fund has become incredibly complicated , and has directly tied the fortunes of the middle class to all the profits and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the story behind part of that transformation . Money matters <p> At the end of 1984 , with the Dow Jones Average at 1211.57 and poised , after a lull , to make its next great surge  --  there were 1,246 mutual funds in America . Their number had tripled in a decade , and would nearly triple again before the 1980s were over , by which time there would be more mutual funds than there were stocks on the New York Stock Exchange . There were growth funds that specialized in large stocks , and growth funds that concentrated on small stocks . There were income funds that allowed junk bonds in the portfolio , and income funds that did n't . There were funds that only accepted IRA money . There were short-term bond funds and long-term bond funds , and funds that combined bonds and stocks . There were balanced funds and overseas funds , sector funds and convertible securities funds , aggressive funds and conservative funds , funds that stressed undervalued stocks and funds that stressed contrarian ideas . Twenty-eight million mutual fund accounts had been opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> But how could middle-class investors know which fund to choose ? Which of those 1,246 mutual funds would speak to them directly , cutting through the growing cacophony of conflicting information and advice ? For even as the funds themselves were proliferating , so was the information one could find about them . A dozen different magazines published ratings of mutual , funds . Fund companies were doubling and tripling their advertising budgets . Article after article anointed this or that hot young fund manager as the new Peter Lynch , the legendary manager of Fidelity Magellan , the most successful mutual fund of the modem age . Halfway through the bull market , this was becoming the critical question for the nation 's mutual fund companies . How could , they ensure that their company 's products would be the ones to rise above the growing din ? How could they be heard ? And as this need became more pronounced , it led to the next subtle evolution of the mutual fund industry . Within many fund companies , power began accruing to those who sold the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who ran them  --  the portfolio managers . Not surprisingly , Fidelity Investments , which was in the process of becoming the nation 's dominant mutual-fund company , was among the companies where this shift was the most apparent  --  to the delight of the marketers and the dismay of the fund managers . <p> It was , in fact , one of those hot young fund managers who would soon come to personify this shift  --  whose fate as a Fidelity fund manager would seem , afterward , to mark the moment when the marketers had triumphed .. When he left Fidelity , after a short , bittersweet tenure , to strike out on his own , he became ( somewhat against his will ) Exhibit A for those who believed that the company 's soul now lay in marketing . There was irony in this , to be sure , for his status as a hot young thing was in no small part the result of the efforts of Fidelity 's marketing staff . <p> The young man 's name was Paul Stuka , and he was among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Fidelity hothouse of the mid-1980s . Stuka 's fund was called Fidelity OTC Portfolio ( OTC stands for Over the Counter , which encompasses the thousands of stocks not listed on either the New York or American stock exchanges ) , and he was 29 when he got his big chance , at the tail end of 1984 . Half a year later , by which time he had . turned 30 , OTC Portfolio was up 51 percent , the second-best six-month return of any fund . Instantly , the press descended . Business Week photographed him leaning casually against a wall , eating a fruit cup . " The Rookie Running a Hot New Fund , " read the headline . Money magazine described his " tousled hair and puckish grin . " USA Today and The New York Times probed his feelings about the market . And not long after that , he was gone . <p> For fund managers , there was now a great deal more pressure , and a great deal more scrutiny , than there had been in previous years . Gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obscurity for a few years , gradually developing a suitable stock-picking style while laying a foundation that would lead to a decent performance record down the road . Now , the Fidelity marketing forces wanted a track record it could promote fight away ; it was n't willing to wait years while a new fund manager worked out the kinks . Indeed , one key reason Fidelity created the OTC Portfolio was that the firm 's executives believed ( correctly ) that over-the-counter stocks were nearing the bottom , and would soon start rising . They wanted a new fund that would be positioned to rise right along with the OTC market . Which they could then sell to the public as a top performing mutual fund . <p> They started Stuka off with $100,000 . It was " house money "  --  seed capital supplied by Fidelity . OTC Portfolio was not open to the public , not right away ; the Fidelity modus operandi during the 1980s was to keep a new fund under wraps for a short time , and observe how the fund manager did with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching . Each trade the new fund manager made was closely tracked , and every move he made examined . There were formal meetings , during which the new fund manager was grilled by a handful of veterans : Why did you buy this stock ? Why did you sell only a portion of that position ? " The first meeting , " recalls Stuka , " I got beat up pretty badly . " <p> But when the OTC market began rising , Stuka 's new fund began rising even faster , and the decision was made to open the fund to the public . Here , of course , was a second reason new funds were begun away from the glare of publicity ; if things worked out the way they were supposed to , the fund manager would have an advertisable track record very soon after he began taking money from the public . To attract money into this unknown mutual fund , Fidelity could waive the load ; such decisions were a key component of mutual fund marketing . Then , once the fund was hot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ load , since most people did n't mind paying a small price to get into a hot fund . In time , this became the classic Fidelity marketing strategy . <p> Did it work ? Every time . It worked with George Noble 's Overseas Fund , which had $2 billion in assets within two years , and with Tom Sweeney 's Capital Appreciation Fund , which had $1.5 billion in its first two years . And it certainly worked with Stuka 's OTC Portfolio . In the " old days , " it took years for a new fund to gain substantial assets : Value Fund , started in 1980 , did n't have $30 million until 1984 . OTC Portfolio had that much money within four months . That was April 1985 . By July it had $55 million ; by October $81 million : by December $162 million . And then it really took off , quadrupling in size over the next six months , until it held close to $1 billion . " There was an appetite for products like OTC Portfolio and Overseas , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But that 's a bit disingenuous . It was an appetite Fidelity did a great deal to whet . <p> " Gunning the fund , " they called it . If you were a Fidelity portfolio manager who had had a hot quarter or six months , you could pretty well be assured that the marketers would gun your fund . Gunning the fund might include fiddling with the load , and it would always include increasing the fund 's advertising budget , as ads touting the fund 's wonderful recent performance would begin to appear regularly in The New York Times , The Wall Street Journal , and other newspapers and magazines . It meant sending out direct mail packages to current customers and prospective ones , while prodding the nation 's financial press to write stories about the latest hot fund manager to come out of Fidelity ( invariably described by the public relations department as appealing and down-to-earth and brimming over with common sense , especially for someone so young ) . And the fund manager himself would be paraded before the press , whether he liked it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his luminous talent . Fidelity spent around $100 million in advertising in 1986 , and when a top Fidelity executive asked its top marketer at the time why the company had to have seven different ads every Sunday in The New York Times business section , the man replied simply , " Because they all work . " Indeed they did . Between 1984 and 1986 Fidelity 's customer base rose from 400,000 households to over one million , while the assets it managed grew from around $30 billion to close to $70 billion . <p> And what if a fund manager became uncomfortable with the way his fund was being promoted ? What if he thought his fund was attracting more assets than he could profitably invest ? What if he wanted the marketers to mm down the throttle , or shut the fund to new investors ? In general , if a Fidelity fund manager had such complaints , he was out of luck . Other fund companies might close a fund to the public if it got too big ; Vanguard , Fidelity 's fiercest mutual fund competitor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when it hit the $9 billion mark . But this was unthinkable at Fidelity during the bull market . <p> Stuka was among the portfolio managers who complained . He had been able to handle the inflow of money during 1985 , but he became less and less comfortable as 1986 unfolded , and the fund began adding more assets in a month than it had gained its entire first year . He 'd come into the office on a Monday morning and discover that the fund had gained another $10 million over the weekend  --  money he was supposed to put to work immediately . He could n't do it . He could n't find enough of his favorite small stocks to invest the assets that were pouring in . He began letting assets sit in money market funds ; at one point 16 percent of the fund was in cash , which was practically a punishable offense at Fidelity . After all , cash holdings dragged down yield and hurt the marketing department 's chance of peddling the fund . " They used to come down hard on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assets in cash , " recalls a former Fidelity hand . <p> Finally , Stuka asked Fidelity to stop advertising his fund . He knew what he was asking : " There 's no overt statement at Fidelity that the funds have to keep growing and the ads have to keep running , " he says . " You just pick it up from the feel of the place . " <p> Later , Rodger Lawson , who headed Fidelity 's marketing efforts at the time , would claim that there were times when Fidelity did stop advertising a fund , at least temporarily , at the request of a fund manager . But this was not one of those times . It was Lawson 's apparent opinion that the over-the-counter market was more than big enough to absorb $1 billion , and that the problem lay , essentially , with Stuka 's fund managing style . Stuka needed to adapt . He needed to find bigger OTC stocks , like Microsoft and Apple Computer , and end his fixation on those unknown little gems he preferred . Request denied . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recount how Stuka had felt pushed into some bad choices , particularly in high-technology stocks . Stuka did n't name names , but he did n't have to ; it was obvious who he felt had pushed him . It was an open secret in the equity department at Fidelity that the marketers occasionally did more than push ; they sometimes demanded that portfolio managers invest in a particular category of bond or security , even against the fund manager 's better judgment  --  the better to pump up the fund 's return . At the same time , Stuka 's performance dropped substantially , which Stuka later attributed to his large cash position . " Looking back , " he said , " you 'd have been better off just throwing money at the market  --  and I was n't willing to do that . " So instead he left . Heady Days <p> It 's 1987 now . More precisely , it 's eight days into 1987 , and the Dow Jones average , which has already risen almost 100 points since the year began , closes for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we lived in a world where momentous events were still signaled by the ringing of bells in the town square , that 's what we would have heard that January day ; we would have heard bells tolling joyously . Instead , we live in a world where such events are signaled by the emphasis they are given on the network news shows and the nation 's newspapers . It is there that this milestone is celebrated , as reporters and news commentators all agree that we have just witnessed a signature moment in a bull market that shows no signs of slowing down . <p> It was a riveting thing to watch . There were days when people would walk into a Fidelity branch office , watch the stock tape for a while , and walk out knowing they had seen the Dow Jones average rise 20 points during their lunch hour . Middle-class Americans did that in the middle of 1987 ; they walked to a brokerage office on their lunch hour to watch the market go up . There were also days when the market went down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 points , but those days were the equivalent of hitting an airpocket  --  momentarily scary and instantly reversed . <p> Yet watching the market rocket upward , mesmerizing though it was , was perhaps the least illuminating way to understand the effect it was having on America . For that , one had to look toward Main Street as well as Wall Street . By 1987 , the bull market had spread well beyond the pages of Barton 's and The Wall Street Journal and had leeched into the larger culture . Each evening , network anchormen announced the latest rise in the Dow Jones average  --  a piece of news they 'd reported sporadically before , if at all . USA Today , a newspaper with a shrewd sense of middle-class concerns , heralded the bull market at every opportunity . Rupert Murdoch , the publisher of downscale tabloid newspapers , began running contests revolving around the stock market . Other cultural ' artifacts emerged ; bull market T-shirts , bull market games , bull market songs . Plainly , this was not the cognoscenti 's bull market , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1987 , 55 million mutual fund accounts had been opened , holding more than $750 billion , while the number of people owning individual stocks was closing in on 40 million . The middle class was not only aware of this bull market , it was part of it . <p> Peter Lynch likes to recall that by the early part of 1987 , whenever he went to a cocktail party , he would be surrounded by people wanting to talk about the market . But instead of asking his advice on stocks , they would offer theirs . That , says Lynch , is when he began to realize that things were veering a bit out of control . One could get the same feeling by looking at Money magazine , circa 1987 . The covers of nine of the first 11 issues in 1987 promised sure-fire strategies for making money in the market . But the bull market had also found its way into other , less likely Time , Inc. , publications , such as People magazine , which ran one article on a formerly obscure money manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , about a summer camp devoted to teaching preteens about the stock market . In Rhode Island , a psychologist began advertising himself as the country 's first " investor psychologist . " The " Stock Doc , " he called himself . <p> During the same period , a handful of new investment gurus emerged . Their new prominence also seemed to suggest that things were getting out of hand . Probably the best-known of the new gurus was Robert Prechter , a 37-year-old market technician who lived in Gainesville , Georgia , and was proclaiming loudly that the Dow would top 3,600 before the bull market ended . This was an extremely appealing message to a great many people , to say the least , and it reaped him an enormous amount of publicity . It also helped get him some 20,000 subscribers to his own highly priced newsletter . What was strange about Prechter 's appeal was not so much his message , but what it was based on . Prechter believed in something called the Elliot Wave Theory , which , to put it bluntly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't seem to matter . Prechter was saying what people wanted to hear , at a time when they wanted to hear it . So he gained followers . <p> Just as middle-class Americans had once talked about real estate at dinner parties , now they talked about the stock market . The smell of money was in the air . This , after all , was the era that glorified the conspicuously wealthy and made heroes out of corporate-takeover artists . Some of the more adventurous of the new breed of middle class investors began speculating in rumored takeover stocks , though they played this game at a distinct disadvantage , since they usually got these rumors from The Wall Street Journal  --  which meant , essentially , that they were the last to know . Still , the rumors were often right ; many of these Main Street speculators made money . <p> Does it need to be pointed out that Wall Street was every bit as euphoric as Main Street ? Perhaps not . With trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange closing in on 180 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning of the bull market commission income stood at record levels . Money was pouring in . Employment in the securities industry went from 1.7 million to 2.3 million in four years . Fidelity quadrupled in size during the bull market ; it had some 8,000 people on the payroll by August 1987 . Merrill Lynch moved into another new headquarters building , this one in the World Financial Center , with plans eventually to take over a second World Financial Center skyscraper . There were no brakes on this expansion , no words of caution from company elders . It was as if Wall Street believed , right along with its customers , that the bull market would never end , that they 'd all get rich and that everyone would live happily ever after . <p> When , late in the summer of 1987 , a veteran Merrill Lynch broker went to his supervisor to suggest that the firm begin holding seminars on how to protect clients in the bear market that was sure to come , he got nowhere . It would be too damaging to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who were working the bull market for all it was worth . Besides , the manager added happily , " We 're not going to have a bear market . The market is going to 3,600 ! " Bear Necessity <p> But it was n't going to 3,600 , at least not then . It 's obvious now  --  and it should have been obvious at the time  --  that the first eight months of 1987 marked the final , frenzied run-up that always comes before the awful fall . There had been just such a run-up before the crash of 1929 , too , and it had been marked by the same kind of euphoria , the same forgetfulness that bull markets always end and bear markets always follow , the same complacency , the same willful suspension of disbelief . <p> " When it will end is anybody 's guess , " a New York Times reporter could actually write in an August story about the bull market  --  a story published barely three weeks before the bull market reached its peak . " Experts say the traditional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : excessive optimism , heavy issuance of new stock , and sudden participation by small investors who normally do not buy stocks . " But that 's exactly what had happened . Excessive optimism was everywhere . Issuance of new stock was rampant . And as for the " sudden participation by small investors , " all one had to do to see that was spend a little time listening to the phone calls pouting into places like Fidelity , as people who barely knew the difference between a stock and a bond began throwing their savings into the market . In that same article , the Times reported that stock and bond funds  --  " the primary investment vehicle of small investors , " the paper called them  --  had seen their combined assets grow from $53.7 billion to $430 billion since 1982 . Where in the world did . the Times think this money came from ? It came from the " sudden participation " of the middle class . There was no other place it could have come from . <p> " The market climbs a wall of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the stock market . What happened in the summer of 1.987 was that everybody stopped worrying  --  sophisticated investors as well as rank novices , Wall Street as well as Main Street . If the history of the markets tells us anything at all , it tells us that there is no surer sign that the end is near . <p> BY JOSEPH NOCERA <p> <p> Joseph Nocera is a contributing editor of The Washington Monthly and a columnist for GQ .
