Window boxes make an entrance welcoming , dress up the facade of a home , and give you the chance to show off a little , " says Janie Singletary . She should know . In Greenville , South Carolina , her business , Gardenhaven , has flourished with good ideas . " A window box should reflect the owner 's personality , " she says . " I try to choose plants with that in mind . " Besides personality , the planter should also suit the home . But within that framework , your imagination can grow . " It 's a chance to do the unexpected , " she says . With Janie 's ideas in hand , we went to work . PARTY LIGHTS The collection of white flowers and foliage ( at right ) is simple and elegant . It brightens the shady entrance to Marsha Twiford 's brick home . The base of the window box is a metal frame called a hayrack . It 's lined with sheet moss and filled with soil . Impatiens and caladiums fill the top , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The result is a window box so fat and full that the metal form is invisible . " Impatiens are great plants to use as water indicators , " Janie says . " If you 're not sure it 's time to water , take a look at the impatiens . They will wilt before anything else and let you know the box is dry , " she says . " In a sunny box , add waterretaining polymers to the soil to hold moisture longer , " she says . With company coming , we spruced up using a Gardenhaven idea : Wire glass votive candle holders to plant stakes . Cut the stakes different lengths and carefully push them into the window box . The candles should sit above the flowers and foliage . Light them as company arrives . " This is also a great look on a patio near an outdoor dining area . But do n't leave the candles unattended , " Janie says . ARCHITECTURAL ADDITION Peter Allsopp wanted a project . His wife , Jean , wanted to dress up the front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trim on their home . Then he had a tin insert made to slip inside the planter for moisture protection . We used Janie 's idea of planting small shrubs in the box to give it a formal look . " Manicured shrubs are terrific in window boxes , " she says . " They will last for several years and then can be moved into the garden . " An ivy garland softens the edge of the box without hiding the trim . " Purchase ivy hanging baskets with long runners , " Janie says . Her instructions : Gently break each plant into two or three pieces . Place them along the front edge of the box at each loop 's anchor point . Tie a piece of twine to a short stick . Push the stick into the soil at one corner of the box . Make a loop and fasten it into the soil with another stick . Repeat this process for all loops , ending at the opposite corner of the planter . Wind the ivy tendrils around the twine .
