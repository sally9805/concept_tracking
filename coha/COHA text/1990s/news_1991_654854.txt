<p> I 'LL come clean : my name is not Olivier , or Gielgud , or Richardson . I 've never won an Oscar . I 've never turned down a script . No one has ghosted my autobiography at the triumphant close of my notable career : My career has not been notable ( and I ca n't be sure it 's at its close yet , anyway ) . I do not appear on chat shows discussing the finer points of Othello . In short , my name does not feature noticeably in " The Great Stage Stars " by Sheridan Morley . <p> There are , presumably , reasons . But one of them - looking back , though by no means in anger - has definitely not been a lack of enthusiasm . I was , as my memoirs would doubtless start by mentioning , stage-struck from a surprisingly early age . Not just stage-struck ; stage-bombed . <p> Initially , it may have been my elder brother 's doing . One afternoon he decided to paint me red from head to foot - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he marched me into the room where my parents were , announcing " The Entry of Mephistopheles . " <p> It was my first taste , I think , of dramatic effect , and , of course , coincidentally , of the power of makeup to transform and impress . When said parental persons finally recognized me , I was peremptorily dispatched bathward for a general cleansing job . I believe , however , that the sheer horror my appearance produced may have inscribed itself in my mental notebook as a Thing Worth Doing . <p> At the age of four or five , of course , I certainly did n't fully appreciate the symbolism involved in this incident . According to German legend , Mephistopheles was not a nice chap - an evil spirit , indeed - to whom Faust sold his soul . Mephistopheles followed up by having a characteristic ball with the soul in question . What , conversely , my brother may have done with the paint - diabolically redecorating my undoubtedly angelic physique - was to offer up my " soul " ( well , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ) known as The Stage . From that fateful moment on , I imagine , my future as an actor was determined . All my future lack of promise was foretold by the entry of Mephistopheles . <p> I ca n't remember whether it was Pooh or Stephanie who came next in the historionic order of things . Stephanie , I think . Stephanie fascinated me . She was an instance of something we did n't have in any shape or form at home : a girl . She lived down the road and had a pigtail . Anyway , she was good for ordering about ( or at least that 's the way I remember it ) and she had to play all the parts in my plays that I decided she had to play . We had a window seat which was perfect , with curtains that could be drawn . The parental bunch were told to sit in a row and , since Stephanie and I , in spite of endless preparatory discussions , had never actually decided what the play-for-today was about , we improvised intensely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Parents , come to think about it , can be frightfully misguided at times . What they should have done was nip in the bud this early chaotic leaning toward theatrical performance . Instead , they pretended to enjoy it . It was my first delectable taste of favorable audience response . Things were going from bad to worse . <p> Then - before or after Pooh ? - came " Hiawatha 's Wedding Feast . " Every summer , the family went to the seaside resort of Scarborough , and there I was introduced to " real theater , " in a manner of speaking . This real theater came in two manifestations . First , there were the Fol-de-Rols . They were the tail end of the Victorian music hall tradition , and were probably frightful . To me they were wonderful . <p> The leading lady and the comic still stick vividly in my mind . Everyone found them hilarious . I had no sense of humor at all until I was about 15 or so , so I did n't know why everyone laughed quite so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Story has it that once I laughed so fiercely that I hit my head on the seat and the switch to tears was so instant and loud that the comic noticed and made some ad-lib wisecrack to mark the occasion . Everyone thought this was outrageously funny , so I laughed with them , and some truism clicked inside me : that tears and laughter often go hand in glove . <p> The other experience of Real Theater at Scarborough was the annual musical held in the gigantic open-air theater . Summer nights being what they might be on the northeast coast , we all wrapped up like Inuits , and sat on cushions and comforted ourselves with thermoses of hot soup . If it did n't rain , this was an occasion of unadulterated magic . And the musical which really grabbed me was about Hiawatha . <p> I think I 'm confused about it now - is this the musical with the song " Oh , Rose-Marie , I Love You " in it ? Does it have Canadian Mounties and a snowstorm ? If so , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enormous rock literally opened up by the side of the stage , and snow was blown into the air from its inner regions , covering stage and audience alike . Wow . I entirely forget the story - or more likely never had much clue what it was all about even at the time - but Hiawatha marries Mini-Ha-Ha , or does n't , or something . It was dramatic , positively , but I was also trying to find out what the snow flakes were made of . <p> When we got home again I decided that Stephanie and I would startle our captive audience by staging Hiawatha 's wedding feast . Clearly the window seat was not adequate . This would be in the big outdoors . So a fire was lit - well , it was made of silver paper covered with orange cellophane - in the bushes , and a wigwam was erected on the lawn . The drama commenced . And then something cataclysmic occurred . <p> A thunderstorm brewed , threatened , darkened , and finally descended . It brought before it a rushing mighty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of garden canes and picnic rugs . I 'm not sure where Mini-Ha-Ha was at the time , but Hiawatha was in full flow , center lawn , dazzling the audience with some soliloquy of inordinate grandiosity . Solemn business . And when the tent collapsed , so did his ego . It was a disaster ! The world had fallen in . He simply burst into a gushing flood of bitter , inconsolable tears . <p> The parent-people , realizing that things were serious for Hiawatha , managed to smother their chuckles , and came over to comfort me . " It 's all right , it 's all right ! " they cried , " What could be better ? A real storm ! It makes it all very realistic ! " <p> But it was n't all right . What had happened was fearsome and ghastly : Art had been interfered with , dramaturgy disrupted . Infinitely more damning than any human critic , nature had made its comment on the proceedings . How easily ambition is flummoxed ! How fragile true art is ! How very early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dawn that the illusion he would weave so subtly on stage can be shattered in a cruel instant . A set falls over , a moustache falls off , and reality has broken through . The would-be sublime crumbles into the undoubtedly ridiculous . <p> " Hiawatha 's Wedding Feast " never resumed . And for a period , I resorted to stagecraft of a more modest sort . I took up puppetry , and dramatized Pooh in search of honey disguised as a cloud and then falling into a gorse bush . Indoors . On a miniature stage . Out of the weather . <p> Amateurs should operate within the limits of their capabilities . Rule No. 1 .
