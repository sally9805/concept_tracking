This was the last breath of summer , its heat suffocating , weighing her down . Laila is on her knees in her front yard , scraping at earth , when she sees the boy once more loop around in the street on his bicycle . Not more than eleven , she thinks , a small figure of a boy in an odd-looking hat . He reminds her of her son , Omar , when he was that age : a grapevine , resting on air , its tendrils reaching toward the sun . <p> Her dog , Charlemagne  --  a gift from her Texas son-in-law  --  tugs at the chain secured to the porch railing as the boy , welded to his bicycle , weaves past moving cars in the street . Just then , brakes screech and a car comes to a sudden stop in front of Mrs. Rhodes 's house . A man leans out the car window , shakes his fist at the boy who has barely escaped with his life  --  who now races toward the sidewalk , hits the curb , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat , taking off on its own , lands in Mrs. Rhodes 's rose bushes . <p> " Damn ! " he says , loud enough for Laila to hear . <p> He gets up grumpily , crosses over to the roses and retrieves his hat . <p> " Guys like him , " the boy says scowling , " should be put away . " <p> Laila glances covertly at the house with the rusted car where , she knows , the boy lives . She says , " Your folks might worry ... riding your bike in the street like that . Taking risks . " <p> " Ma expects me to be a sissy , like some girl . But Dad do n't worry none . " He taps the crown of his hat . " He got me the hat two years back  --  just before he skipped town . " He flashes a grin . " It 's been around , that hat . Fell in a creek near Livingston a year ago . And once , it blew out my Ma 's car window .... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . Last time he wrote , Ma tore up his letter ... " A sly look touches the corners of his eyes . " But I got them pieces when she were n't looking . Made out his address in New Orleans . " <p> Laila marvels at his straw hat , with pheasant feathers forming its headband . Frayed and drooping , it rests lightly on the crown of his head . <p> He points to the patch of brown earth in the midst of green , and the clumps of wilted grasses at her knees . <p> " It 's against the law , Ma says ! " <p> Momentary fear stings her throat . " To dig in my front yard ? To make a garden ? " <p> She understood harassment in a land under occupation . Her land . But not here , in America , from this scarecrow of a boy . <p> She looks into the restless gray eyes of the boy , their color reminding her of a Wadallah winter sky . <p> " To build in your front yard . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 'll be a fall garden , " she explains . " The backyard is too shady for growing vegetables . " <p> But here in the front yard , away from the shade of the mimosa tree , she has chosen a few meters to receive full benefit of sun . Barely a stone to dig , and no edge of rock to scrape or cut into flesh : only rich , loamy earth to weed and till . <p> Crouching , the boy begins to stroke the amber-splashed fur of Charlemagne . He asks , looking up , " Does he have a name ? " <p> " My son-in-law , the history teacher , named him Charlemagne . " <p> " Funny name for a dog . " A reflective pause . " Think I 'll call him Charlie , for short . " The boy 's gray eyes glint in the sun . " My name 's Billy . What 's yours ? " <p> " Laila El-Fihmi . " She says it slowly , carefully , the way her Detroit teacher pronounced it in English class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Never heard that name before ... " <p> " It 's an Old Country name . " Laila smiles . " Mrs. Rhodes next door calls me Miz El  --  for short . You can , too . " <p> Billy stands up , looks back at the dog . " Ma do n't allow no dogs at our house . " A matter-of-fact statement brooking no sympathy . <p> Tenderness , like a breeze , filters through Laila 's defenses . " Come by tomorrow at one and have dinner with us , " she says . " You 'll get to meet my daughter , Salwa , and her family . You can play with ... Charlie . " <p> Billy shrugs . " Do n't promise nothing . " <p> He gives the dog a quick pat , leaps on his bike , and like a young horseman , gallops across the lawn and back into the street . He turns and waves his hat at her  --  a small , cityboy , playing at cowboy . <p> Work in the garden for now must wait . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to come first . A few weeks before , when Salwa finally persuaded her mother to leave Detroit for Houston , Salwa and her family started to come to dinner every Sunday  --  the children spilling over Laila 's small house , filling its corners with a vortex of motion and noise . Ramzi , five , his brown eyes questioning the hidden meanings of the adult world , often came to her for comfort . Katy , two years older and more self-sufficient , and Jesse , eight , played their noisier games outside , with Charlemagne . <p> Laila brings out the mound of squash , corer and pan , sets them all on the patio table , and settles down in the porch swing . <p> As her hands begin to deftly hollow out each squash , she considers the shape and color of the houses on her street . Except for Mrs. Rhodes 's brick house , all the houses in her neighborhood are made of wood , with wooden doors and no bars to secure windows . <p> Their Wadallah house is built of stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her grandfather built the house to last the centuries . <p> But here , in this rented house , a thief could easily break glass , or pry open windows and crawl in  --  unhampered by steel or stone . For the first few days of her arrival here from Detroit , the thought had kept her awake  --  until Bob gave her the dog , to allay her fears . A dog named Charlemagne . <p> " He 's a half-Sheltie , " Bob said and expected her to understand . <p> In Wadallah she learned her English from a children 's book with colored pictures and a dog named Spot  --  not Charlemagne . And in Detroit , she took " intensive " English classes after work , but could not quite master American slang . <p> Her husband , Bakri , remained behind in Wadallah  --  refusing to abandon the house , the vineyard , and the olive tree to strangers . <p> " Your brother in Detroit is right , " Bakri had said . " Go now , for the children 's sake . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> A promise and a hope . <p> Laila 's brother , who owned an import store in Detroit , even sent them tickets . But her daughter , Salwa , seventeen , and her son , Omar , fourteen , left Wadallah reluctantly . <p> Laila worked long hours in her brother 's store , and practiced her spoken English every chance she got . <p> " Is your husband well , Mrs. Brown ? " she asked a regular customer once . <p> " Well enough to nag the daylights out of me , " Mrs. Brown replied . " Between you and me , I think he 's got bats in his belfry .... " <p> " And how are the bats in your poor husband 's belfry ? " Laila asked the next day . Mrs. Brown shook her head , and hurried out with her jar of marmalade , her black olives  --  perhaps too worried about her husband 's condition to answer . <p> Independence  --  Laila 's children gloried in the word . She raised them to explore their talents , to test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a separate path . Her daughter , Salwa , fit into American life like old-fashioned bread around pebbles in a taboon oven . In college she met Bob , with Texas roots , and brought him home to meet her mother . When Laila inadvertently called him " Boob , " his laughter exploded in her face . Later , in private , Salwa gave her mother a lesson in accents and American slang . <p> Her son , Omar , missed his father , worried about political events in their country . Two years ago , at age seventeen , he decided to return to Wadallah to live . <p> As a small boy , Omar had rebelled against authority and the wisdom Laila offered  --  probing and testing for himself . Once at six , defying warnings , he climbed their olive tree to the highest branch , and promptly fell , breaking his leg . Her scoldings only served to spur him on toward a second and even third try . <p> If Laila had her way , he would study medicine . He had the brains for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say to anyone who asked . <p> As Mrs. Rhodes hobbles across the yard toward Laila , Charlemagne strains at his leash , the beginning of a growl forming in his throat . <p> " I 've lived in this neighborhood for thirty years , " Mrs. Rhodes says , leaning against the porch railing . " But , my dear , this place is fast going to the dogs . " <p> " I usually keep the dog in my backyard , " Laila says apologetically . " But today , I thought the change ... " <p> Mrs. Rhodes 's laughter crackles across the yard . " I 'm not talking about real dogs . Just houses , and people . " She sniffs , drawing up the muscles of her sagging face . " Like that family with six kids down the street . And the dump where Billy lives . " <p> Laila 's hands pause momentarily in their task . " How old is Billy anyway ? " <p> " Not a day under fourteen ! " Mrs. Rhodes plunges her cane into the grass at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age . And not too bright . His third year in the sixth grade , you know . " She waves her hand in the air above her head . " And that sloppy hat he wears . I bet a dog 's ear he sleeps in it . " <p> She focuses pale green eyes on Laila 's face . " By the way , what 's your son up to these days ? " <p> What can Laila say ? Mrs. Rhodes would understand little , if anything . Since even she , his own mother , failed to understand . <p> In his last letter , Omar wrote , " I 've joined the Resistance . I 've pledged to fight this unjust military occupation till the end ... " <p> Concerned , she wrote back that same day , to dissuade him , to ask : " But how will you earn a living ? What does your father think ? " <p> She was still waiting for answers . <p> Laila meets Mrs. Rhodes 's glance , allows herself a careful smile . " Omar has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without flinching , waits for words to find their mark . <p> Mrs. Rhodes curls her lower lip . " When he becomes a real doctor , maybe he can find a cure for my arthritis ... " With a flourish of her cane , Mrs. Rhodes turns and heads back to her own yard . <p> Midway into their Sunday dinner , Billy walks in , his hat pushed back , his face pink with scrubbing . Hesitantly , he slides into the empty seat between Bob and Ramzi . <p> Laila serves him the stuffed squash with the sterling silver spoon her children gave her for her fortieth birthday . Billy runs his finger over the raised indentations on the handle . " Never seen real silver before , " he says , wide-eyed . <p> " The rest of my ' silverware ' is stainless steel , " Laila admits . <p> Later , over coffee , Salwa looks uncertainly into her mother 's eyes . She and Bob are contemplating a possible trip to Mexico  --  without the children . A chance for the honeymoon they 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the small girl Salwa once was . At eight , seated cross-legged on the floor , she had tried to fit together pieces of a broken doll . An hour passed before she brought its shattered skull  --  bisque oozing with glue  --  and set the pieces before her mother . " Help me this time , please , " she said . " I wo n't ask again . I promise . " <p> Until the next time . And only if absolutely necessary . <p> Of course , she 'd be glad to stay with the children for a week . What were grandmothers for ? <p> Monday morning , when Billy stops by Laila 's house on his way to school , she says , " I wo n't be here next week , Billy . I need someone to take care of Charlie . And to water my new garden . " <p> He stands in the doorway , his hat light and airy on his head . " How much ? " <p> " Five days . Five dollars . " <p> " In advance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... " <p> He flicks his fingers at the inner rim of his hat . " Will do . " <p> " I 've planted cabbages and carrots , " she says . " Water mornings if you will . " <p> " Plant corn , " he says . " I like corn . " <p> " I 'll plant corn in the spring . " <p> Before he leaves , Billy asks suddenly , " You got more kids of your own ? " <p> " One son , almost nineteen , who lives with his dad in a place further , even , than New Orleans . " <p> She shows him the photograph of a grinning Omar in blue-striped shorts , a soccer ball balanced precariously on his head . <p> Billy shrugs . " He 's big . Not like me . " <p> Laila glances at Billy 's hat that adds inches to his height . " You 're a good size , Billy . Just right for you . " <p> " Would n't hurt to grow two , three inches more , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laila rakes the garden soil smooth , the postman brings Laila the hoped-for letter from Wadallah . <p> Her husband writes of pruning their old olive tree . He plans to graft it with a cultivated olive sprig , a plumper type . Then , as if speaking about the weather , he tells Laila of the arrest of the cobbler 's only son , age seventeen . He 'd been interrogated and forced to sign a confession . " Their house or business may be in jeopardy because of it . One is never quite sure what else the military will do in collective retaliation .... " <p> " But do n't worry about us here , " Bakri adds . " Omar has finally found a job he likes . He comes by my coffee house nearly every day to eat a falafel or kabob sandwich , to ask about my day . He promises to write you soon ... " <p> Omar 's promised letter arrives Friday . Laila glances at the crisp , rounded handwriting , the alien stamp . She pictures Omar seated across from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fringe of dark lashes  --  intent on her face . A poet 's eyes to cause a girl 's heart to melt , a mother 's heart to weep . <p> " We watch over each other , my father and I , " he writes . " But we do miss you and your home-cooked meals . God willing , we 'll see each other soon . " He adds , almost as an afterthought . " Did my father tell you of my job at the furniture factory ? I enjoy working with wood . I like the feel and smell of it .... " <p> This was his answer then  --  to alleviate a mother 's worries . My son , the carpenter , Laila thinks . It will have to do for now . <p> At her request , Laila 's grandchildren call her Sitti . <p> " Bahib-kum ! " she says and gives each a hug . " That means I love you . " <p> " ... hib-kum ! " Comes back in a Southern drawl , the guttural sounds turned to mush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ childhood , of a grandfather who , seated cross-legged under a canopy , had chiseled each stone of their Wadallah house ; had even carved his name , the date , and a horse on the lintel , above the front door . <p> Together they make the dough for the thick pita-bread that she will bake in Salwa 's modern , self-cleaning oven . And in the backyard , away from prying eyes , she teaches them takka wigri , the " pop and run " game  --  a baseball-like game with sticks . <p> A day before their parents are due back home from Mexico , they all take a walk to the nearby park . The children climb the wooden pyramid with its rounded holes and slide down  --  laughing , as they bounce onto matted grass . At their urging , Laila allows herself a sudden , dizzying glide , and lands in a rumpled heap on the ground below . <p> On their way home , as they watch a mockingbird chase an orange cat away , Jesse observes , " Billy has bird feathers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says with a giggle . <p> Katy tugs at Laila 's sleeve . " Do birds cry when you pull their feathers off ? " <p> But what can she tell them of pain and tears ? How could she explain it ? <p> During the drive back to Laila 's house , Bob describes with awe the wonders of the Aztec temples and ancient Mexican pyramids . <p> " Please come to dinner Sunday , " Bob says . " I 'm cooking barbecue on our outdoor grill . Not as complicated as your stuffed squash ... but just as good . " <p> She wonders now whether Salwa ever spoke to Bob of Wadallah . Did she ever describe the rock-strewn hills , the lingering sunsets , the anemones growing wild in the spring ? Did he follow the politics of her tortured land ? <p> Did he care ? <p> Laila turns the small brass key in the lock and opens her front door . In their house in Wadallah , their key was made of iron and required muscle power to turn . Inside , she finds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scattered on the rug . Junk mail , a magazine or two , a letter from Detroit , and the anticipated letter from Wadallah . She picks up the mail and sets it on the couch , with the blue air letter from Wadallah on top of the pile . <p> She walks outside to check on Charlemagne . Dry dog-food nuggets still remain in his bowl , and his water bucket is almost full . She sighs with relief . Billy has kept his word . <p> Laila settles down in the living room with a cup of hot minted tea , props up her legs on a stool , and carefully opens the letter from her husband , Bakri . <p> For a long time , she sits with the open letter in her lap and stares at beige walls , leaning . She is sliding down a dark and narrow tunnel , deep into rocky earth . Empty , airless space covers her like a blanket , takes her breath away . <p> And no one knows her name . <p> She hears a loud knocking at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walks into the living room , a hat dangling between thumb and forefinger . Billy 's hat ! She sits across from Laila , and drops the hat on the rug at her feet . From a small coin purse , Mrs. Rhodes takes out a folded paper sealed with tape , hands it over to Laila . <p> " Gone to New Orleens to look in on my old man , " begins the scribbled , misspelled note . " The fiver was n't enough for bus fair . So had to hock your silver . Pried your window open to get in but did n't take nuthin else . Fed Charlie And watered the garden . Keep that hat til I make good on your silver spoon . Billy " <p> Mrs. Rhodes 's glance moves in an arc , settles on the air letter in Laila 's lap . <p> " So  --  how long will it take before that son of yours hangs up his doctor 's shingle ? " <p> Laila 's answer is crisp , filled with a mother 's pride . <p> " Several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning to specialize .... " Laila 's mind skims over options , settles on one . " Eyes , he says . " <p> " Tell him to hurry up  --  before my cataracts get any worse ... " <p> " My husband , " Laila adds softly , " is planning to come here for a visit . " <p> " I suppose it 'll be good to have a man around the house . " Mrs. Rhodes draws in her breath . " Mine 's been gone these twenty-odd years . " <p> " Dead ? " inquires Laila solicitously . <p> " Nope . Just run off . " A glazed look settles on Mrs. Rhodes 's face . " Left me just before Thanksgiving . Told me he could n't stand my sweet potato pie . " Mrs. Rhodes heaves an involuntary sigh . " And all these years , I thought it was his favorite . " <p> She adds , after a pause , " But I 've learned to cope  --  with or without him . Learned to stand on my own two feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> After Mrs. Rhodes leaves , Laila reaches for Billy 's hat , studies its nicks and crevices , runs a finger across its feathered hatband . She thinks of Billy , small and vulnerable without his hat . She missed him already . <p> The face of her son , Omar , suddenly imposes itself under Billy 's hat . She can see Omar 's slow-spreading smile , the flickers of light in his dark eyes . <p> What " terrible " crime had he been accused of ? <p> " Someone , under interrogation in the zinzanah prison , claimed Omar ' conspired against the military , ' " Bakri wrote . " When the soldiers came to arrest him , he ... " <p> She draws in her breath as words shift , go under  --  like ducks drowning . She waits for words to reappear , unscrambled , on the page . She rereads the letter twice . Three times . <p> Finally understands . <p> Laila remains alone in her living room until the sun melts into the rooftops outside her window . She feels light-headed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furthest corner of space . She would have to hold on tight , lest the rush of wind in her face make her dizzy and cause her to lose her grip and fall . <p> Later at dusk , when earth had begun to cool , Laila goes outside to look at the garden . She gets down on her knees and discovers tiny sprigs of cabbage and carrot leaves breaking through rock-free earth . She remains on her knees for a time , her husband 's letter still tucked into her bodice . <p> He 'd tell her the details later , when he saw her face to face , he wrote . Then , as if to reassure her , he tells her of their olive tree . <p> The blast the soldiers had used to dynamite their house had not even scorched the olive tree . The tree remained standing , rooted in rocky soil , towering over the strewn and blackened stones that had once been their home . <p> May Mansoor Munn is a Quaker and a Palestinian American .
