If you 've ever dreamed of getting a brand-new look , here 's inspiration : our 3 winning makeovers By Anne Merriman Photograph Photograph // REMEMBER WHEN YOU COULD BROWSE FOR CLOTHES , take an exercise class , spend two hours at the salon-in short , remember when you had time for you ? Judging from the 1,000-plus entries we received for our second annual Makeover Mom contest , plenty of you do-and you miss it . Last fall , we invited readers to get away for a spa weekend and be treated to a hair-and-makeup , wardrobe , or fitness makeover . As we combed through the moms ' entries ( and we read every one ) , we noted some shared concerns : uncertainty about which clothing colors are most flattering ; the need for a fast , effective exercise routine ; and hesitation about shedding an outgrown but comfortably familiar look . Photograph Makeover moms , looking good and feeling great , clockwise from top left : One-year-old Ryan Czarniak lays claim to his radiant mom . Says Avis JonesDeWeever , " I love pampering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be pampered myself ! " Rebecca , husband Guy , and Ryan Czarniak are flying high . Kim and Ashley Louise Welsh , after two Dumbo rides : " Mommy , I want to go again ! " // Could we help ? Yes ! We flew our three winners-plus one child each-to the Grand Floridian Resort &; Spa at Walt Disney World for three days of pampering , revamping , and just plain fun . Two dads also came along to care for their 1-year-old sons while mom was made over ( the other child , a 3-year-old , " helped " during her mom 's redo ) . Here 's how we gave each winner the fresh start she wanted . AFTER MORE THAN 20 YEARS WITH LONG , straight hair , Rebecca Czarniak was itching for a change . " I love long hair , but mine is so baby fine it just seems to hang there , " she said . Photograph Rebecca Czarniak , 37 , works as a letter carrier for the U.S. Postal Service . She lives in Redding , CA , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ryan . // Our hair and makeup pro , Miami stylist Chen Ho , suggested a layered , chin-length bob . That was a bit too much of a change for Czarniak , so they agreed on a longer version that would fall at her collarbone . First Czarniak had her strawberry-blond hair color-corrected at the resort 's salon . " I 'd been coloring my hair at home for years , " she says , and over time it had become damaged and unevenly tinted . When she returned , with her tresses a rich and even coppery red , Ho cut off five inches and then layered the hair around her face . " Her old hairstyle hid her beautiful cheekbones , " says Ho . " This cut is n't drastically different , but it really opens up her face . And it does n't require a lot of fussing . " Ho styled Czarniak 's hard-to-hold hair by working mousse into the roots and blowdrying with a round brush , gently pulling hair against the direction of growth for lift . Makeup Magic Because Czarniak 's favorite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retired for more flattering shades . Yellow-toned cream base camouflaged the redness around Czarniak 's nose , and on her chin and forehead ; concealer softened her under-eye circles . Ho subtly contoured her cheeks with a blend of brown and peach powder just a shade darker than her skin tone . The best way to apply , he explains , is to " suck in your cheeks , then lightly brush on blush in the hollows . " On lips he used a violet-brown gloss . Ho gave Czarniak 's blue eyes a dramatic boost with these simple steps : Sweep beige shadow on entire lid ; follow lid crease in a darker shade , here a heathery blue , to lend depth . Line top lashes with black pencil , finger-smudging slightly upward at outer corners to visually " lift " eyes . Dust ecru on brow bone to make eyes seem larger . Finish with a coat or two of mascara , using an eyelash comb between coats to prevent dumping . Czarniak 's reaction to her new look ? " Hey , I look pretty good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out ! " Two months later ... Czarniak still loves her image : " I 'm staying away from pink makeup tones , I apply liner the way Chen showed me-and I get a lot of compliments on my hair . " WITH MUCH OF HER clothing two sizes too small and the prospect of a competitive job market once she gets her Ph.D . next year , Avis JonesDe Weever wanted to build a professional wardrobe that also expressed her own style . But with son Guy II , she " has hardly any time to take a shower , " much less go shopping . New York City fashion stylist Lisa Vaamonde helped her sort through racks of suits , pants , and dresses , plus piles of scarves and jewelry . Together they zeroed in on her best shapes , styles , and colors . Style Tips Consider your body type when choosing clothes . Jones-DeWeever favored large tunics , but Vaamonde pointed out that they hid her curvaceous figure . Slightly fitted tops and jackets were more flattering . Play with proportions . While Jones-DeWeever swore by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and short skirts , it turns out that the exact opposite look was a winner : a short , fitted jacket that accents her slim waist and a long , straight skirt . " I never would have chosen this on my own , " she says , " but I love it . " * Look for details that give an outfit personality . A discreet side slit in the skirt and sleek brown knee-high boots lend pizzazz but are still office-appropriate . Spice up a plain outfit with color . Jones-DeWeever favored " safe " neutrals like camel , beige , and black that-when worn alone-washed out her complexion , says Vaamonde . To demonstrate , Vaamonde asked her to bring her favorite work outfit to the makeover . The beige suit she chose ( top right ) fit her figure but not her skin tone . Once Vaamonde tucked a bronze paisley scarf around the neckline , though , her face glowed . Other good colors for her include green-witness the impact of her avocado jacket-blue , violet , and soft pink , a hue Vaamonde says flatters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a new outfit ( the green-and-brown ensemble ) , but a much better idea of what works for her . Two months later ... Shopping-and getting dressed in the morning-are much easier . " I feel more confident putting outfits together , " says Jones-DeWeever , " and I always try to wear color around my face . " AFTER LOSING SO OF THE 70 EXTRA POUNDS that lingered after her two children were born , Kim Welsh was interested in firming up her body all over , but , she said , " if I won the lottery the first thing I 'd do is get my tummy tucked . " Photograph Avis JonesDeWeever , 29 , is a Ph.D . candidate in government and politics at the University of Maryland . She and her husband , Guy , live in Washington , DC , with their 12-month-old son , Guy II . Photograph Kim Welsh , 29 , is a medical-office manager in Glasgow , KY . She and her husband , Greg , have a son , Robert , 9 , and a daughter , Ashley Louise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morgan . // So Lori Shofran , a sports fitness instructor and registered dietitian at the Disney Institute , designed a flexible program that includes aerobics , strengthening , and flexibility-and targets Welsh 's abdomen . " If she has time only for aerobics one day , she can do strength and stretching the next , " explains Shofran , " just so long as she tries to cover each area three times a week . She should see results in six to eight weeks . " The Workout Twenty to 30 minutes , three times a week , on the treadmill to burn fat-challenging herself by increasing the incline and alternating 5- to 10-minute highspeed intervals with her regular pace . Strength training three days a week to improve posture , help prevent injuries , and build muscle mass , which will help Welsh burn more calories . She started with five-pound dumbbells , doing two sets of 12 to 15 repetitions each . Shofran prescribed a wholebody series of exercises to tone arms and chest , thighs , hips , and buttocks . Flexibility exercises three times a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also recommended that Welsh look for classes in yoga or tai chi near her home . As for her sagging tummy , Shofran told Welsh that she needed to strengthen the muscles in her midsection . She suggested starting with 30 crunches three or four times a week . Her pointers : Keep your chin a fist 's distance from your chest . Press your lower back flat on the floor . Exhale as you lift and inhale as you release . To avoid neck strain , place a hand towel under your neck , holding the ends as you lift up . " Crunches are my favorite exercise , " Welsh says . " They 're easy , so I do them , and Ashley Louise loves sitting on my feet and directing me : Do it right , Mommy . " ' The Diet While exercise will tone muscles and boost metabolism , Welsh will need to watch what she eats too , says Shofran . Her advice : " Consume between 1,500 and 1,800 calories a day without depriving yourself of the foods you love . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - dense foods . She is to stick mostly to the light category , with some calorie-moderate foods and a few dense ones ( such as red meat , cheese , and mayonnaise ) , which tend to be high in fat . So she might opt for a grilled chicken sandwich over a ham sandwich or a small cup of chili instead of a pizza slice . " I was pleasantly surprised to see that pancakes and syrup made the light list , " says Welsh . Two months later ... " I 've lost six pounds since the makeover , " Welsh reports . " I 've noticed a big difference in my body tone . My stomach does n't sag like it used to , my clothes fit better , and I have more energy Sidebar How do you get to gorgeous ?
