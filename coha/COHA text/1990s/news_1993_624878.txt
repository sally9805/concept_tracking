<p> WHEN comparing the dress of career women here with those in cities on the cutting edge of fashion , such as New York and San Francisco , the differences can appear vast . <p> Many career women in Houston are still buying short skirts and bright colors and believing that Anne Klein and Ellen Tracy are fashion-forward designers . Never mind that the former is long dead , the latter never existed and hemlines around the world are plunging to the ankles . <p> What Houston 's career women do have in common with those in the fashion capitals , however , is that some of them are suddenly finding themselves sought-after customers . Career women with more taste than money nevertheless spend money on quality clothing , even if it 's not of the couture ilk . <p> " " We all focused on the tip-top designer efforts for so long , we advertised it , we sold it , " says Tootsies ' Mickey Rosmarin , " " and we forgot bridge high fashion was a fantastic product . " " <p> Clothing from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look exactly like that of top Italian , French , Japanese or American designers . " " But you create the same look from bridge lines . " And stores across the country , from Bergdorf Goodman in New York to Neiman Marcus in Houston , are realizing this . <p> Tootsies began focusing on lower-priced but high-quality lines years ago , said Rosmarin . " " Now the whole fashion industry is becoming very basic , and that 's why you can take an Ellen Tracy garment , which has good fabric and details , and with the right alterations make it look just right . What we 're now doing is gearing a level of service to go with the product . " <p> " " The word efficiency is what we 're focusing on , " said Rosmarin , " " with departments and a sales team geared directly to this customer . If we need to go to her , we 'll go to her . If we need to open at 7:30 in the morning before she goes to work or stay open until 9 o'clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> The effort has been dubbed Tootsies PS - the PS stands for Professional Services - and kicks off in August . For abnormal shopping hours , customers will need appointments , said Rosmarin , " " but then we encourage appointments at any time so women can create a long-term relationship with the salesperson and make wardrobe-building a team effort . " <p> Similar efforts are under way in other Houston stores . At Saks Fifth Avenue , Lisa Aaronson says special events such as breakfast and lunch seminars are being used to educate customers . <p> " " We have invited clients to morning meetings with the designer 's representative , who educates the customer on a particular collection and how to wear it . And we offer giveaways and incentives to come back and shop in the store . " <p> Another effort has involved personal phone calls from sales associates to customers , and , in store , Saks ' Fifth Avenue Club representatives have concentrated more on moderate spenders . " " Regardless of how much they want to spend , outfits can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ served lunch , dinner , whatever they need , and things can be sent , delivered or altered quickly , " Aronson said . <p> At Esther Wolf , Fred McCann said showings are nearly always held during lunch hours , and the store provides a buffet lunch . <p> While Houston store representatives are hesitant to say the couture market no longer exists , it has substantially changed . <p> Gary Gerhart , president of Isabell Gerhart , now in the process of liquidation after many years of catering to the couture customer , knows firsthand what will and wo n't sell . <p> " " Houston women are not going for the trendy and the flashy . <p> The real flashy Moschino looks and the gold seems to be gone . <p> What is selling now is Dana Buchman , some Randy Kemper and Gruppo Americano , which is even cleaner , very monotone , self-colored buttons . Anything novelty has to be very inexpensive . " Stores that long catered to big spenders are now finding it is necessary to educate customers with more modest pocketbooks about what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merchandise wagons . <p> Saks is pulling together a career complex in its Pavilion on Post Oak store , bringing lines such as Donna Karan 's DKNY , Calvin Klein 's CK , Todd Oldham 's Times Seven , Dana Buchman , Ellen Tracy and the Company line , and Anne Klein II together on one floor . <p> Neiman Marcus Galleria has already completed its merchandise grouping for the career woman on the third floor . <p> " " It 's the way we put it together that can look fashion-forward , " said Wehring , and noted , too , that Neiman 's has created many high-quality fashion pieces for its own labels . Saks does the same thing with its The Works line , which has also been sold on television . <p> Education is the key in the new departments , Wehring said . <p> " " We have had a large ad campaign geared toward this customer , showing garments , accessories , jewelry and shoes - the total look . And as a sidebar to the ad , we ran notices of special trunk shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , talk and order if they thought they needed something . <p> Neiman 's has also adjusted showings to working women 's hours , with early-morning breakfasts or after-hours wine-and-cheese meetings with representatives or designers . <p> " " We have also gone so far as to bring the designers of these collections here , like Linda Allard ( who designs the Ellen Tracy line ) , in order to bring in customers who have n't been to these types of shows before . " <p> Esther Wolf is another firm whose trunk shows no longer feature only elite designers but include lines such as Teri Jon , Ann May , Augustus , Alberto Makali , Fyzal Virani and Tahari . <p> Neiman 's has created the position of wardrobe consultant , " " a young woman in our store who can go out into the community , into office and real estate companies and talk to them about a professional wardrobe . " <p> General store manager Lea Little said the scenario Barneys New York sees with its career woman customer in Houston is not necessarily that she is without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she ca n't afford Armani , but she 's deciding to spend the money elsewhere . She 's making a choice to look for value . " <p> Little sees customers who purchase pieces of the store 's private label collection , in which top-quality jackets run $ 495-$ 595 , to wear with higher-priced designer pieces . <p> " " Barneys is also buying a lot of young designer collections that are n't as well known . You get the designer looks without the price , and that 's fun . " <p> Generally , however , the lines Houston career women buy are more basic than on the other coasts . <p> " " I imagine there could be a piece or two from Todd Oldham or Anna Sui that might perk up a wardrobe , " said Rosmarin , " " but I think you could combine with CK or Ellen Tracy pieces for a better effect . I do n't see it fitting in . " Norma Kamali 's line is one Rosmarin recommends for a touch of avant-garde with high quality . <p> What Houston stores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical concept of one-stop shopping that includes everything from clothes to cosmetics . Boutiques are too small to handle the concept , and larger stores here are relying on sales associates and personal shoppers to pull it all together for customers , although Neiman 's does sometimes work fragrance and cosmetic displays onto its third floor . <p> Some Houston boutiques have found themselves at the right place at the right time . " " The big stores are now doing what we 've always done , " said Melinda Lamoreaux , who handles marketing and advertising for Ms <p> That store has always had a perspective of one-stop shopping . <p> " " We 're not a shoe store but shoes are a service that we provide , especially if our buyer sees the perfect shoe to go with an outfit . " <p> Ms. lines that appeal best to the career customer are Anne Klein II , Tracy Reese for Magaschoni , Ralph Lauren , Emanuel ( Emanuel Ungaro 's secondary line ) , Lyn Kohls ( a young New York designer of special-occasion dresses and simple little suits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which started out as a western influence line but now works handily for casual-dress offices . <p> " " We do set a lot of appointments , do the preseason trunk shows , and most of us who sell also do private wardrobe consulting outside the store , " said Lamoreaux , a practice that benefits both the customer and the sales associate . <p> But Lamoreaux does n't see a very fashion-forward customer in Houston . " " I do n't think they 're out there with their little silk ties , but it 's still very conservative . " <p> Gerhart believes that even the moderate-spending career woman will soon tire of putting out the money for regular-priced bridge lines . " " This customer will probably feel she 's paying too much , and the discounters will go after her . " He says Loehmann 's is already trying to hire some of his best saleswomen.
