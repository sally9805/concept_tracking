Record producer extraordinaire John Hammond , whose discoveries ranged from Count Basie to Bob Dylan , turned impresario in 1938 and 1939 for a pair of Carnegie Hall concerts featuring an eye-popping array of now legendary jazz , blues and gospel artists , including Basie , Sidney Bechet , Charlie Christian , Benny Goodman , Sister Rosetta Tharpe and Big Joe Turner . Both concerts are available for the first time on CD , in digitally remastered sound , with 23 previously unreleased tracks thrown in to sweeten the pot . This three-disc boxed set is a platinum mine of great American music . <P>  --  By Terry Teachout
