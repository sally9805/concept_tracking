The father took the children for long walks on Sundays because he imagined they shared his enthusiasm for the flat fields of the Beauce in summer , with the light clouds drifting across a pale sun , the hawthorn hedges flecked with fragile white flowers , and the edges of the wheat stained with red poppies . But the two girls did not share his enthusiasm for the flat fields of the Beauce , or even the sight of an occasional rabbit darting for cover , or the floppy brown ears of the pointer reappearing in the wheat . It was convenient for the father to imagine the girls shared his enthusiasms , but the truth was , all they shared was their name , Trubetskoi , which was embarrassingly difficult to pronounce , and the houses they lived in with their mother , and the Scottish nanny , and the cook from the Gold Coast . They lived in the winter in a house on a blind street in Paris , and in the summer in a villa on the side of a cliff in Italy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declivity in the Beauce . <p> When the two girls lagged behind on the muddy fields , their father would wait impatiently for them to catch up and talk as he strode onward in an effort to entertain them . " The first time I met Pamela , " he would say with a little tremolo in his voice , his eyes misty , speaking of their mother as though they had no connection with her , " she was standing at the door in the sunlight in the Parioli with a Panama hat in her hand . She looked like that Gainsborough  --  or is it a Reynolds portrait of Lady Hamilton ? You know the one I mean , where she holds a straw hat in her hand , with that flush in the cheeks and that russet hair tumbling down her back and the soft laughing mouth and that air of rushing in or out somewhere . She was Enrico 's girl then , of course . You remember the Italian , do n't you ?  --  the one who was the papal guard . He 'd taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who came from some wild country and , he said , had tante di quelle miniere di diamanti , " and the father would imitate Enrico  --  whom the children had never heard of before  --  speaking Italian and shaking out his long slim fingers to indicate the gold mines or the gold or money , anyway , the children understood , falling from his fingers like leaves from a tree . The father would stare down at the girls expectantly , apparently waiting for some sort of response , a laugh , perhaps , but he seemed not to be seeing them , his two girls , Sarah and Anne , with their limp pigtails , their gray slanting eyes , and their cold pink knees , exposed in the kilts brought back from Edinburgh by the nanny and let down from the waist , so that they never seemed to grow out of them . The father seemed to be seeing imaginary children , boys , perhaps their father had always wanted boys  --  red-cheeked , rambunctious boys who would run around the fields and chase rabbits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dogs and bored by these long monotonous walks and preferred to lie in their warm beds and eat chocolates and read books or sit by the fire and listen to their mother tell stories . <p> Their father spoke in cadences that seemed strange to the girls , full of unfamiliar idioms , unlike their mother 's or even their nanny 's clipped formal English where the sentences were ordered and precise , with the adjectives and the adverbs in place . He did not seem to realize how odd he sounded , or how strange he looked to the girls . Everything about their father seemed embarrassingly excessive : he had a large arched nose , a big mouth , and thick dark hair on his chest . He was very tall . He had long legs , long arms , a wide stride , and he swung his head from side to side like a metronome as he walked . They had to crane their necks to see his face , and when they saw it , which was not often that summer , he would appear suddenly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driveway as he charged up to the house in his Porsche  --  he never looked the way they had imagined him . Nor did he correspond to their mother 's description of him , which was handsome . Even the Scottish nanny , who obviously did not approve of their father , said he had a certain presence . Nor did he resemble his photographs , which their mother kept in prominent places , such as the piano in the drawing room . In the photographs , he was always wearing a wide-brimmed hat and grinning broadly , and he looked very pleased with himself ; he rarely looked that way that summer . On the contrary , he seemed solemn and anxious , as though he were about to tell the girls something , but just not right away . <p> As for their mother , she tiptoed around the house silently in their father 's presence like a shadow and hovered near the telephone in the hall in his absence , as though it were a volcano that might erupt at any moment . The traces of their mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She kept her voice low , and her clothes pale and soft . She lost weight , and even her lovely thick red hair seemed thinner and less red . All these changes told Sarah , the elder of the children , that her father was rather as frightening to her mother as he was to her . <p> Sarah believed her father did not care for his children particularly . This was not of great consequence , as they did not depend on their father in any practical way . Their mother provided for their well-being . She was a melancholy but steady presence . That summer she wept rather too copiously over Little Women . She seemed to the girls a failure as an adult . <p> Sarah could remember summers when the sun had seemed warmer and the old mill less damp and cold . This summer was so cold and damp that both girls wore their flannel shirts and their Shetland sweaters , although the wool pricked their necks . Despite the three years ' difference in age , the girls were always dressed identically . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and their short kilts . As they tramped across the wet fields , thick mud clung to their shoes . Wind stung their knees . Their hands were bluish with cold . The sky was low , the clouds heavy as stones . They dragged their feet with difficulty , toiling along behind their father listlessly . The wheat was not as high as it should have been for that time of year , and if it rained again before the harvest , the farmer told them , the crops would be ruined . <p> Then the weather changed : the sun blazed fiercely in a white sky , and the leaves of the chestnut tree on the edge of the fields hung down heavily like ripe fruit . White dust blew up in their faces as they descended the narrow road that went past the local mansion with its high iron fence and slow swans reflected in dark still water . The mansion seemed smaller than Sarah remembered it . The garden had gone wild , the paths were overgrown . Sarah watched pink petals fall slowly to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a Spaniard and left for Spain , " their father told them , speaking of the owner of the mansion , as they pressed against the iron bars of the gate . <p> " What 's eloped ? " Sarah wanted to know . <p> " You know , run off , gone away , beat it , " the father replied impatiently . He was always telling Sarah she asked questions to which she knew the answers , but it seemed to Sarah that there was always some piece of information that did not fit . It was a puzzle that she was unable to fit together . <p> " Why would she want to run off with a Spaniard ? " Sarah asked , because she remembered Mlle de Marcy as an elderly lady with hair that stuck out like little gray wings on either side of her pale face . She wore a gray pleated skirt and a cardigan and pearls and had once come for tea with Sarah 's mother and smoked a cigarette and tried to sell her mother a field . <p> " For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't you know why women run off with men ? " her father exclaimed . <p> Sarah did not believe babies were brought by the stork or found under cabbage leaves . Nor did she believe the magazine she had once read with pictures of men with whips and women in short leather skirts and no tops , their legs spread apart , draped in chains . She looked up at her father and tried to think of something appropriate to say , but he had already moved on , was striding down the road under the tall leaning elms , so that he seemed suddenly small and alone , even lonely . She wanted to call out something to him , but she was not sure how to call him back , or whether to call him Father , which sounded strange , or Michael , as her mother did , or even Mr. Trubetskoi , which everyone else in the house called him . <p> Sarah became aware of a monotonous , aggravating noise at her side . She looked up and saw her sister , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kicking her shoes against the wood and wailing , " I 'm tired of walking . I want to go home to Mummy . " Her mouth looked large and red and ugly . <p> " Well , go home to Mummy , then , if you 're going to be such a baby , " Sarah said . Anne kept sucking her thumb . <p> " Go on , go home . I 'll catch you up in a minute , " Sarah said , though she was not at all sure her sister could find the way home . Nor did she intend to catch her up . She watched Anne walk alone down the road , aware that the trees had darkened , and the sky was swept clean of cloud . It was that time of day when the French sky turned brilliantly clear for a moment before the fall of night . <p> Sarah felt the eyes of unseen animals , hares , squirrels , foxes , <p> lone wolf watching her from the woods , as her sister walked off uncertainly , her head bowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Sarah looked up at the mansion and saw a light glimmering in an upper window and imagined Mlle de Marcy and her darkskinned Spaniard lying entwined in one another 's arms on the floor . She shivered and then without a glance over her shoulder ran along the road under the leaning elms . She ran up the hill , her heart pounding , the glare of the setting sun in her eyes . She ran on toward her father . At first she thought he had disappeared , but she found him standing in the gloaming , gazing blankly at the dark roses climbing up the stone wall . <p> " Where 's Anne ? " he asked Sarah . <p> " Gone home , " Sarah replied . Her father found this explanation satisfactory . She slipped her hand into his , and he looked down at her , as though he had just noticed her . He asked her to remind him just how old she was now , and was it not ten or eleven , a big girl in any case , and did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on in silence while Sarah wondered what to respond to such a question . As night fell , her father told Sarah what she had already guessed . Anne , Sarah was certain , had fallen into a ditch in the dark by then . When Sarah asked him for some sort of additional information , her father thought for a moment and said , " You know , it 's rather like having a plum and a peach on your plate , and not being sure which one you want to eat . " <p> Sarah tried to imagine whether her mother was the plum or the peach , but neither fruit resembled her mother 's slim , pale shape . Sarah walked along the dust path in the dark , concentrating . What came to mind was the unknown woman . Sarah imagined her quite unlike Sarah 's mother , quite unlike Sarah herself . She saw her as a woman who was courageous , who would never have deserted her little sister in the dark , or wept over Little Women , a woman with lustrous dark hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plum-shaped behind , a woman who danced with a high comb in her hair , a woman called Candella , like that Spanish girl at school , who smoked cigarettes through a cigarette holder , and swilled red wine that stained the dark hair of her upper lip , and sat with her knees apart . Sarah imagined the woman with her father 's baby , a plump , red-cheeked boy , slipping across bright satin on her rounded hip . <p> The moonless night was now dark . Above the great flat French fields , there were only a few pale stars . Sarah stumbled blindly along the dust road beside her father , her hand burning in his . <p>
