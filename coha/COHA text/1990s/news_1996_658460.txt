<p> " Welcome to my office , " bellows Lar Douglas , throwing open the door to his dinosaur-sized rig . <p> The off-road vehicle , unmarked except for a rear window sticker that reads " Klingon Warrior Academy , " takes Mr. Douglas high into the snow-capped hills and thickly wooded valleys of the Sultan Basin in northwest Washington . <p> Along the winding gravel paths that cut scars into the peaks , Douglas parks his four-by-four " office , " lifts powerful binoculars to his eyes , and waits . <p> One of only six timber investigators for the Washington State Department of Natural Resources , Douglas patrols the forests against the increasing number of thieves and vandals who steal saplings , underbrush , and trees from public land . <p> " People have discovered you can make a lot of money in wood products , " he says . " When they leave the pavement , it 's the wild West again . " <p> Ripping trees from the ground might not sound like an easy way to make a buck , but there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forest products . <p> Roughly $ 1 million is stolen from state and federal lands each month , according to state officials who started tracking such thefts a few years ago . <p> To get tough on the nurseries and cedar mills that buy suspect wood , county prosecutors in Washington are using state racketeering laws originally devised to put organized crime figures behind bars . <p> Last month , the latest defendant pleaded guilty for his part in stealing state cedar and selling it to a mill on the Washington coast . <p> Five people , including the mill 's owner , have been charged under state law with trafficking in stolen timber . <p> " We 're barely making a dent in the potential casework , " said Bill Steele , chief investigator for the Department of Natural Resources . " There 's plenty of job security for us . There 's never a lack of cases . " <p> Cedar trees are one of the most prized trees growing on state and federal land , said Douglas . Frequently , poachers will fell a tree , load it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lumber mill . <p> But that 's not always the scenario . Near the Canadian border , 100 cedar trees were cut so the fragrant tips of the branches could be used for making potpourri . <p> Cedar is n't the only species fetching high prices in the underground market . Mountain hemlock often is sold at nurseries for about $ 1,000 a piece . <p> Poachers can expect a payoff of about $ 300 for every hemlock stolen from state lands . <p> Other popular targets include bear grass , Douglas fir , and fire maple . During the holiday season , poachers sometimes cut down truckloads full of young saplings to sell as Christmas trees . <p> The trade in stolen wood products is so widespread that Steele claims 2 out of 5 large nurseries knowingly buy goods from timber bandits . <p> " I am confident that every one of the nurseries knows about this , " he said . " The price is so high , they do n't make the fact that it 's illegal a high priority in their decision to buy the product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Nursery in Seattle , says the well-established nurseries always check to see if a vendor has a permit to harvest on state land . <p> " We only buy from people who are licensed to dig , " says Mr. Kerwin . " I think in the outlying areas buying stolen products may happen with the smaller nurseries . But I have n't heard or seen anything about it in years . " <p> There are generally two kinds of people that steal forest products from public land , according to investigators . <p> The people who drive trucks into the forests to steal cedar - " cedar rats , " as Steele calls them - tend to be men in their 30s . Most have had some experience in the forests , either as loggers or outdoorsmen . <p> But cedar rats are far outnumbered by the marauding bands of individuals and families who roam the forests for rhododendrons , bark , ferns , and bear grass - products that end up in a nursery or floral business rather than at a mill . Some types of bark are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Natural Resources manages about 2.85 million acres of land , and patrolling such an immense area is a constant challenge . <p> Douglas is a sort of " bush cop " who can detect subtle changes in his neighborhood as well as any traditional beat cop . <p> " If I see an area where they 've been working , I 'll watch it . If I hear a power saw or see a truck , I 'm going to photograph them before we go in , " said Douglas . " We may confiscate their load , their trucks , and their power saws . It really hurts these guys when you take their power saws . That 's the tool of the trade . " <p> Last year , Douglas and a sheriff 's deputy tested using a helicopter to spot illegal logging . In the first hour , they wrote $ 5,000 worth of citations . <p> The possible charges for timber theft range from third-degree misdemeanor to first-degree felony , depending on the amount of the wood . The maximum penalty includes some jail time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material . <p> Jail is n't a likely destination for poachers , however . " The courts are so packed with murderers , I guess the people stealing cedar do n't rate very high on the list of cases the prosecutors want to pursue , " said Steele . <p> And theft is n't the only problem for investigators like Douglas . <p> Stopping his vehicle beside a clump of trees , Douglas hops out and points to a group of stumps that look like they 've been hacked off with a blunt instrument . But the trees were n't felled by an ax ; they were cut down by a hail of bullets and shot gun shells . <p> " I 've heard a lot of automatic weapons fire out here , " he said . " Gangsters come up here to train . They come out here and shoot and go back to the city . " <p> Besides the half-dozen trees that lie ruined by the side of the road , Douglas says the entire 15-acre patch of fir trees is ruined . <p> Stray bullets have lodged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of those bullets in the mill , it can shatter the blade and possibly injure or kill the operator . <p> As a result , the Department of Natural Resources - and ultimately the state 's school construction fund that is financed by timber sales - has lost about $ 300,000 in potential revenue from this one stand of trees . <p> It is n't an isolated case , said Douglas , citing damage from gunfire as a major problem on statThe Department of Natural Resources is closing more and more state forests to off-road vehicles to prevent theft and vandalism . While unpopular with hikers , an iron gate is often the only way to stop the pillaging of natural resources . <p> " But people grumble , " says Steele . We get more complaints about shutting down land access than we get about theft off of state lands . " <p> Tightening access to timberland seems to have helped limit the problem on private land . Weyerhaeuser Company , the state 's largest private landowner , has experienced some timber theft , but " with a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says company spokesman Frank Mendizabal . <p> Even if vast tracts of publicly owned forest lands are put off-limits , Steele says timber heists will continue : " Theft will shift from Weyerhaeuser land to state land to small , private landowners . It just wo n't go away . "
