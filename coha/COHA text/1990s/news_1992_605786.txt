<p> We often pass them by . When we stop to help , it is usually a furtive exchange . Who are these people ? How did they come to be where they are ? Each day this week , Style will profile one homeless person . <p> Mickey and J.R . built the fort last summer . Out in the pines behind McDonald 's . They wanted to get away from Badger and them for a while . Badger , he 's a real character , but sometimes there 's fighting . You do n't always feel safe . <p> They made it out of plywood , set on old tires . Cardboard sides to keep the wind out , plastic sheeting on top . Old carpets , mattresses , the sleeping bags that Miss Naomi brought . It 's real comfy , better than the overflow down at Belvoir . The overflow 's got beds for everyone and showers and food but they got rules too . <p> Here in the woods it 's a camp , like . And the rules are the rules of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning they go over to Route 1 and panhandle in the parking lot at the Hybla , or Beacon Mall , in front of the K mart maybe , or Bob 's . On real cold nights they split a room at the Harry Smith Motel , up near the Beltway , $ 26 . <p> His name is Mickey M. Holmes . With 60 winters at his back , he 's dean of these men who live in the woods , the Harry Smith , the overflow , a laundry room , a vacant trailer . Tom and Buckey , Steve , Francis , Danny . Fifty in all living along the Route  --  folks Miss Naomi calls " the hard-to-reach homeless . " <p> Mickey looks like Willie Nelson born with a cherub face . Nice smile , soft white-gray beard . Luminescent , baby-blue eyes . Polite and well spoken , a gent down on his luck , " ashamed " to panhandle but good at it . <p> How he got on the street was , his wife , Betty Ann , died in 1984 after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went mad with grief . <p> " I met her the Fourth of July in a bar , yep , settin ' in a bar in Southeast Washington . " It was 1955 , he was back from Korea . " Believe it or not , we were married the 21st of that same month . God , I loved that woman . " <p> He laughs until the tears start . " She was a sweet , wonderful woman . I 'm not saying we did n't have our disputes . " She was a retail floor manager , he a sheet metal and roofing man . They lived in a trailer , owned it free and clear , parked it up at Nightingale 's , paid by the month . " Had a good life with her . Humph ! " <p> He stops talking . Just sits at the table , in McDonald 's , looking down . His whole body drooping . <p> " Ca n't figure it out , " he says . <p> That 's okay , who the hell can . Miss Naomi says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " These are probably the sickest , most dysfunctional people in the system , " she says . " They 're not in the system . " <p> In the woods , more like  --  Mickey 's friends in Mickey 's world , and Naomi Yamamoto of the Fairfax/Falls Church Community Services Board with a federal grant , supplying them with sleeping bags and blankets , boots and bus tokens , tokens of motherly care . <p> She knows the forts in the trees , the quirks in the men . Badger and J.R . with their cardboard sign : " Homeless . Will Work for Food or Money . Thank You . God Bless . " <p> " Christmas Eve it worked like a charm , " says Badger , unruly tufts of hair darting out from under his woolen cap . " ... A lady gave me a box of food . She said , ' I got a Christmas tree for you too . ' I said to myself , ' Shoot . ' But I figured , you do n't turn down nothing . " <p> And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nutty side , but I like him . " <p> " He would n't hurt anybody , " says Miss Naomi . <p> " No , not in a million years , " says Mickey . <p> " He 's pretty sick , though , " says Miss Naomi . <p> " Yeah , " he says . <p> " He needs help , " she says . <p> " Needs it bad , " he agrees . <p> And Francis , living snug in a treehouse kids built years ago  --  if someone tries to get him at night he can hear them first , climbing up the tree . One winter he got an electric heater and a long extension cord , and every night he 'd run the cord through the woods and plug it into the outdoor socket of a public building and sleep warm as toast . In the morning he 'd trot over first thing before anybody arrived at work and unplug . <p> And Tom , stumbling drunk out of the trees , feeling " outta my mind . " Once a Navy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kong , Saigon , Subic . " Met a girl in the Philippines , she took me up into the mountains . There was a stream with a big rock in it , we bathed in the stream and sat on the rock . She built me a bamboo hut , she took me wild boar hunting . They 'd use a guy for bait , and when the boar got close they 'd jump out of the trees with machetes . " <p> The trees  --  Miss Naomi thinks of the men along the route as " hiding in the trees . " Mickey likes the freedom . At the overflow it 's hard to sleep , there 's always somebody snoring too loud , talking . Still , when his wife died , " I shouldn'ta did it . I started drinking and living out here . " <p> He shakes his head , takes a drag on his cigarette . <p> Gave the trailer to his daughter , a mistake because it ... well , somebody hauled it off from Nightingale 's . Maybe the lot rent did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trailer . <p> " I think life is what you make it , " he says . " You know , you can make it good or you can make it bad for yourself , and right now I 'm making it real bad for myself . " <p> The beer is one thing that makes it bad , he 's the first to admit : His daughter is over in Maryland , but wo n't have him around his grandkids when he 's drinking , which is daily except for a few months last year when Miss Naomi got him detoxed so he could have cancer and eye surgery . <p> He pulls out his wallet to show pictures of his three small grandchildren . " Michael 's my favorite , that 's my little man , " he says . " That 's my boy there , he 's my angel , the apple of my eye . " <p> It 's a heartbreak all right . <p> Mickey was born in Sibley Hospital in the District , raised by his grandparents . He 's known Badger " since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some beer with his stepfather . ... I think he 's 37 , 38 now . My grandfather was an engineer , he 's passed away now . He was 102 years old the day he died , I was beside the bed , holding his hand . I loved that old man . " <p> Brothers and sisters are here and there , he knows not where , " and to be truthful with you I do n't much care . " <p> Cheery laugh . <p> Feels guilty he has n't been to Betty Ann 's grave but a few times . <p> " Makes you feel sad ? " Miss Naomi asks . <p> " It does , " he says . " When I leave there I head right for a beer joint . I 'm telling you the truth . ... I do n't drink whiskey , and I definitely do n't drink wine . But when we buried her over in Fort Lincoln Cemetery in Bladensburg I got a pint of Black Velvet , that 's strong stuff , and I drunk that . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now he figures his beer money into his daily panhandling goal , along with motel money if the weather 's too cold . " I like my beer , it 's no sense lying about it , " he says . " But I always look out for my main things first . My room first , I look out for a roof over my head tonight if it 's possible . Then I worry about my beer . ... I usually get a 12-pack . Go over to Toddle House and get a hamburger . Couple packs of cigarettes . ... <p> " I 'd rather be by myself , " he adds . It 's more dream than goal . " If I could get my welfare , my Social Security check and make a halfway decent living where I could eat and everything like that , I 'd try to get me a housekeeping room somewhere . ' Cause I can cook . " <p> Today , he says , " it 's going to be rough ... ' cause I 'm getting a late start . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the gray . The cold . <p> " I 'm enjoying sitting here talking to you two , ' cause I do n't get to talk to too many people . " <p> The interview over , he makes his pitch . He needs $ 19 . <p> Which , he says , would bring him  --  this day only  --  up to the $ 29.95 he says he needs for a room somewhere other than at the Harry Smith , someplace nicer where he can be alone with his 12-pack , his cigarettes , his thoughts of Betty Ann . <p> He rummages in a pocket , produces a dollar . <p> Gives change .
