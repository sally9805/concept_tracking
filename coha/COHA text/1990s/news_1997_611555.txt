<p> Here at the largest food bank warehouse in America , where bus loads of volunteers arrive each morning to sort donated groceries for hundreds of thousands of hungry New Jerseyans , the revolution in volunteerism being championed by President Clinton and Colin L. Powell seems already to have arrived . <p> The Community FoodBank lures more than 6,000 volunteers a year , says its executive director , Kathleen Dichiara , herself a volunteer . On a recent day , 56 AT &T; Corp . employees spent eight hours washing grime off canned goods to be picked up by soup kitchens and homeless shelters . An elementary school civics class was checking expiration dates on baby formula bound for low-income mothers . <p> But several miles and a world away , at the Apostle 's House pantry and homeless shelter in downtown Newark , the only unpaid helpers were two probationers ordered to perform community service . There were no volunteers to help assemble monthly food rations being picked up by AIDS patients or  --  more importantly  --  to mentor single mothers and their children living in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours for one day is not going to help us unless they 're helping us paint a room or do a cleanup , " said Sandra Accomando , executive director of the Apostle 's House . " We need people who want to deal with very troubled parents and children , one on one , consistently , on a long-term basis , and most volunteers just are n't available for that . " <p> This apparent mismatch between human needs and available volunteers captures the challenge facing the Presidents ' Summit for America 's Future that Clinton and Powell are staging in Philadelphia on Sunday . It will be a media extravaganza featuring George Bush , Jimmy Carter , Gerald R. Ford , Nancy Reagan , Oprah Winfrey and hundreds of mayors , governors and corporate executives . <p> One of the summit 's chief goals is to recruit enough adults to act as mentors by the year 2000 for at least 2 million at-risk youngsters struggling against the odds of poverty , violence , addiction and school failure . A recent , comprehensive study of mentoring showed its dramatic potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of working with Big Brothers/Big Sisters , the nation 's premiere mentoring organization , 500 Philadelphia children , ages 11 to 16 , showed far less drug and alcohol use and far better school attendance than those on the waiting list for mentors . <p> But every major study of volunteerism in America shows that most volunteers do not work directly with poor adults and children . Independent Sector , the largest organization of charitable groups , found that 93 million Americans volunteered at some point in 1995 . But Michael Gerson , policy director to Sen. Dan Coats ( R-Ind. ) , wrote in U.S. News &; World Report that fewer than 10 percent of them worked in the area of " human services . " More than 20 percent of the 20.3 billion hours that the survey called " volunteering , " he wrote , went toward helping neighbors with baby-sitting or yardwork . <p> " It 's a truism that people volunteer in their own social strata , in areas in which they 're comfortable , " said Andrew Kohut , who headed an extensive study of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are , of course , exceptions . Maria Feit , communications director for Greater D.C. Cares , says about 12,000 people have completed the orientation program for volunteers since its 1989 founding , 60 percent of them from Maryland and Northern Virginia . She said most of the suburban volunteers work in the city on such projects as occasional tutoring at a boys ' shelter . <p> " Most of our large projects are in the District , and we do n't have a problem filling them , " Feit said . <p> Big Brothers/Big Sisters now sponsors 100,000 mentors , and has committed to summit organizers to double that number . But getting to 15 million , the summit 's long-term goal , will require building a vast new national infrastructure , drawing on religious institutions , Kiwanis Clubs , public schools , corporations and many other sources , according to Jay Winston , a Harvard University public health professor and mentoring expert on the summit 's steering committee . <p> Moreover , studies show that mentors , to be effective , must work with children at least once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for most two-earner families . The Chicago Tribune recently reported on efforts funded by the Amoco Foundation to recruit mentors for 48 teenage drug dealers and dropouts in the inner city , many of them already fathers . When 35 potential mentors finally were located , none were available for training except on Saturdays . The program has yet to begin . <p> Winston observed that a vast national expansion of mentoring will require a large cash investment in training and quality control . Failure of mentors to show up can damage children 's already fragile self-esteem more than not helping at all . Big Brothers/Big Sisters provides extensive mentor training , along with monitoring by professional caseworkers . <p> " Mentoring is not for everyone ; it 's a hard commitment , " Winston said . The common approach of contributing time sporadically  --  volunteering for a few hours or a day , once a month or once a year  --  " does n't have a measurable impact on the lives of at-risk kids , " he said . <p> A group called Everybody Wins has found a way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ District , New York and several other cities into one-on-one relationships with inner-city schoolchildren . The organization recruits men and women to spend one lunch hour once a week reading aloud with one child , the same child each week . <p> Sen. James M. Jeffords ( R-Vt. ) , who started the program in the District , has read every week for more than two years with a fourth-grader named Diego at Brent Elementary School . More than 700 volunteers from law firms , congressional staffs , and private corporations now read weekly with children at seven elementary schools in low-income neighborhoods near their offices , executive director Joanie Chase said . <p> The program has generated such enthusiasm among children about " this special adult in my life , " Chase said , that hundreds of parents turned up at an evening workshop to meet their children 's reading buddies . <p> But most volunteering is much more occasional . The AT &T; employees who came to the FoodBank , all wearing sweat shirts bearing the words " AT &T; Cares , " were using a once-a-year day off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " My first thought this morning was , ' How on earth did I think I could take a day away from the office ? ' " said Sarah Jepsen , a public relations director . " But you forget about that . This is very rewarding . We 're helping the community but we get as much from it as they do . " <p> Still , the summit 's ambitious goal conflicts not just with the time constraints of volunteers but also with demographic trends . The " young old , " healthy retirees with time on their hands , are increasingly moving to retirement communities and to areas of the country far from cities , where at-risk youth are concentrated . Meanwhile , Americans in general are moving ever farther from urban centers . And while many suburbanites volunteer faithfully at homeless shelters and children 's centers in cities , they are the exception , according to several scholars . <p> " As a rule , volunteers do n't commute , " said Princeton University professor Julian Walpole , who has studied nonprofit organizations . He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that directly affect them , such as schools , churches and arts groups . <p> " What used to happen in cities before the exodus to the suburbs is that well-established and well-off people and major corporations had a real stake in the neighborhoods , " said Richard Leone , president of the Twentieth Century Fund . " But economic stratification has increased every decade since World War II and it 's had a real impact . " <p> Dichiara and Accomando have both faced this problem . Until three years ago , when Dichiara 's warehouse was in downtown Newark around the corner from the Apostle 's House , she had to work hard to overcome fears of the inner city among her predominantly suburban volunteer base . <p> " A woman called me after a television special was done on us , mentioning that I live in Summit , " an affluent New Jersey suburb , Dichiara said . " She said , ' I think what you 're doing is wonderful and I 'd like to help . Where in Summit is your warehouse ? ' I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Newark . And she said , ' Oh well , I never go there . ' " <p> Accomando , of Apostle 's House , recalled a recent volunteer effort by a group of corporate employees who agreed to spend a day rehabilitating a shelter for pregnant teenagers and then to eat dinner as guests of appreciative single mothers in a neighboring shelter . The volunteers appeared to grow uncomfortable as evening approached , she said , and canceled the dinner plans after the shelter residents already had cooked it . <p> " Obviously , this was not a good experience for the mothers , " she said . <p> " Every agency needs volunteers , they 're integral to our lives , " Accomando said . " But when I hear discussion that this is going to help us where government ca n't , I just do n't think that can happen . " Apostle 's House recently lost half its state-funded budget for a program in which caseworkers intensively monitor troubled families whose children otherwise would be placed in foster care . " Twenty volunteers a day wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some supporters of the weekend summit say volunteers ca n't replace government . " This past week , with the flooding in the Midwest , we saw the virtues and the limits of volunteerism , " said Jesse L. Jackson , who has endorsed the summit but questioned its potential impact . " The people bagging sand was a wonderful volunteer achievement . But it was the president coming with money from the Federal Emergency Management Agency that will pay for a Marshall Plan for those communities . " <p> Rahm Emanuel , a senior adviser to Clinton , said the president believes his high-profile support and that of the former presidents and Powell will provide " firepower " to " change the dynamics of volunteerism . " But University of South Carolina professor Abe Wandersman , who specializes in the psychology of volunteerism , said this will require a far more complex strategy . <p> " Effective volunteerism requires understanding the costs and benefits to the volunteers , " Wandersman said . Projects like the Everybody Wins lunchtime reading program appear to have balanced them successfully . But unless the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wandersman said , " this will be a huge disappointment .
