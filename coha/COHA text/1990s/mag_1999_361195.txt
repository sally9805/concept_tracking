Dawkins ' memes have proved nearly as controversial as Darwin 's ideas about natural selection once were . Susan Blackmore 's The Meme Machine ( Oxford University Press ) , which goes so far as to suggest that we are our memes , is sure to escalate the war of words that periodically rages on the pages of the New York Review of Books and the Boston Review . <P> Harvard University paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould , who has long battled what he calls " Darwinian fundamentalism , " dismisses the meme as a " meaningless metaphor . " H. Allen Orr , an evolutionary geneticist at the University of Rochester , is n't much nicer . " I think memetics is an utterly silly idea , " he complains . " It 's just cocktail-party science . " <P> Natural selection , Orr points out , applies beautifully to random processes such as gene mutations but would fall apart if animals could deliberately upgrade their young . Ideas , on the other hand , are often consciously modified before they 're transmitted . Meme evolution , unlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invented calculus , " says Orr , " he did n't do it by generating a million random ideas and choosing the best one . " Darwinism , say the critics , has no relevance under these conditions . <P> This does not deter memeticists , who , for technical reasons of their own , regard such objections as profoundly misguided . Indeed , Blackmore , taking the theory to its logical conclusion , suggests memes account not only for the evolution of culture but also for consciousness itself . The mind , in Blackmore 's scheme of things , is little more than a nest of memes . <P> She 's not alone in this view . Tufts University professor Daniel Dennett , an enthusiastic and prolific memeticist , acknowledges that it 's an unsettling philosophy . " People are terribly afraid that this is going to rob them of authorship and creativity , that it will be the swallowing up of the self . " That fear , he speculates , may account for some of the vehemence of the opponents of memetics . " The view of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says , " is different enough from the tradition that it can get people fairly upset . " One advantage of memetics over tradition , Dennett points out , is that it can explain consciousness without resorting to a little man in the back of the head calling all the shots . <P> But there is dissent even within the " ultra-Darwinist " ranks . M.I.T. linguist Steven Pinker finds the ideas of memetics intriguing and occasionally even useful but does n't quite believe it 's a science . Nor does he accept the nest-of-memes view of consciousness . " To be honest , I do n't even know what that means , " admits Pinker . The problem , he says , is that memetics assumes the brain is essentially passive , like a Petri dish awaiting infection . It does n't account for the self that responds subjectively , that feels sensations such as love , envy and pain . " Babies are conscious , " he points out . " That 's why we do n't operate on them without anesthesia . And their minds have not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kher
