Landscape : " Strictly speaking , " says geographer D. W. Meinig , " we are never in it . " No , that 's not what I 'd felt in Ireland at all . Reconsider . Leslie Marmon Silko , the Native American writer , maintains that the word " landscape " as we use it is misleading , assuming as it does that the viewer necessarily stands " outside or separate from the territory he or she surveys . " In truth , we live inside that which for another is view . On the island , I always had the pleasing dual sensation of being self-contained , indisputably situated , while at the same time knowing we were part of a view , a shape drifting in and out of focus , admired from the mainland . On the island , the shifting colors of mainland mountains were decorative  --  scenery . Landscape was where we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , skipping across a causeway of stones . We use the word " landscape " as if we could disconnect ourselves from it , stand far enough back to see it clear , instead of looking at the ground beneath our feet . Nowadays we prefer to speak of the " environment , " but it too , in its original meaning , is what surrounds us , rather than what we are inextricably involved in . Where 's a word for a wholeheartedly lived-in landscape ? Maybe simply place  --  which we 're willing to say has a " spirit , " a character evinced in the lives of its people place , which is humanly defined by buildings and customs but is also firmly attached to and in part defined by the piece of earth on which it sits . In Ireland , I felt I got inside a landscape for the first time , became a living part of a living place . Joined to it by work , friends , curiosity , and staying power , by living out its rituals and long silences , I learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think about land . But after five years there , soaked , sated , curiosity and rest- pt t lessness pushing me in other directions , I began to spend weeks in Dublin , weeks in Paris . In the end , I returned to the United States in order to go back to school . I felt compelled , finally , to try to make a place for myself in the country I 'd fled , to find a place to live as richly as I had in Ireland . No doubt it was going to be a very different life . I joked that I 'd retired into idyllic isolation before I 'd ever had a job . Now I needed to backtrack , to take up the path most of my friends already had  --  toward a career and some version of American adulthood . I began by subjecting myself to the island 's polar oppo-site  --  Manhattan . There I plunged into the nonstop man-made , bedazzled by people who dwelled solely in their minds , fascinated to meet other young writers scraping by on dull jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just given up , probably . But I was loving the city 's energy and my return to museums , music , and film . I knew I could never entirely give all that up again . For many , nowhere is more defined , more obviously a place , than a city . Yet given my experience of the island , I quickly became disoriented , overwrought . I was living five stories adrift above the pavement , landless , hovering . I craved silences , the sound and touch of unimpeded weather , animals , an open sky of unbuilt-on distances . This was n't going to be easy . Newly married to a New Yorker , a poet who imaginatively thrived on the subway 's whining rattle and the geometry of abandoned buildings , I tried to adapt ; we switched cities three times in five years , finished graduate school , began teaching , wondered what next . Secretly , I studied maps . Before long I also studied the ads for teaching jobs in the country . So now after passing through five years of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hoping to discover in Geneva some surviving version of a traditional farming community alongside a small town , a workable compromise in a fairly unspoiled American place . No housing tracts here , hardly a mall .  | A modest , slow-moving town , still on the fringes of corporate America , set in a lush landscape . Naively , or perhaps nostalgically , I long for this to be a place where the natural world still informs human life , a place whose community lives attuned to a beautiful landscape . David tilts his head with doubt  --  he 's as interested in decaying downtown Geneva as in the lake . He does n't share my insistent need to try to connect to this landscape , or for this move to be " significant . " I 'm the one who 's nudged us in this direction ; I desperately hope it will work , that this will be a place we 'll want to stay in for longer than a year or two . It 's 1982 , I 'm thirty-one . We 're about to take up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 're thinking about having children , and we 're trying to stop thinking about ourselves as on the way somewhere , but as actually having gotten somewhere . And so arriving here feels to me like a milestone  --  the possible solution to where in this country I might embark on the next phase of my life . Our stacks of cartons from a city liquor store block the view of the lake . We quickly abandon the settlement of our new world and walk outside . " Here I am ! " I want to shout to water , stone , and sky . But where am I ? I 'm still not altogether sure , nor am I sure how I can find out . Not from the change-of-address packet delivered by the post office , or the barely memorized network of roadways between home and office and shopping plaza . Not from the realtor 's hallowed hierarchies of neighborhoods , or a colleague 's who's-where car tour . A first tentative exploration , standing still and taking a deep breath . Start small . Here : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ten miles south of Geneva , New York , and the college we 've come to teach in . We 've chosen the edge of this edge , avoiding even the slight clutter of town in favor of a lakeside cottage . Pitched high up , with huge windows , the house  | seems dreamily afloat , a glass boat on a mild sea . Sunrise impossibly pinks the kitchen , and in the evening , in westerly windows , the hue of last chances is as magnificent as morning was . We pace about our plot . Two dozen steps to the precipice above the lake , a drop of thirty feet down a cliff face to the cold lapping water , a stairway to get to it . Below and above , a generous helping of water and sky , both today the undoubting blue of a newborn 's eyes . A line of upright evergreens shows where the yard stops and the wild tangle of woods begins  --  here , inside , is the space we 're meant to take as our own . Out there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blank  --  an interruption , a respite . A space we 're forced to drive around . A lake wide enough so I almost feel islanded , the other shore just half decipherable , tiers of patched fields in their several greens and the vague blue of ridges rounded by centuries of cultivation , a high path between Seneca and the next lake over , Cayuga . What 's felt of islands can be felt of a house by a lake . Woods enclose us on three sides , the lake 's our only window on the rest of the world , the scale of it small enough to grasp in the mind , imaginatively hold . Nearby , a short walk out , there 's a countryside part farmed , part wooded , part dotted with a motley array of houses . It is broad and open , without many surprises . Unlike other regions of New York , there are no nearby intimate hills and winding valleys , land sneaking up on you . Instead , the long rippling of single-minded ridges , the slow dip to the lakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning sun ? at their height , they have a Tuscan richness . This is wine country . But this is also poverty country . For all the fecundity of the vineyards and nearby corn and cabbage fields , the human habitat is in disrepair . Houses may boast a graceful colonial front , but around the side is the sagging porch holding a broken washing machine and a snarling chained dog , windows fluttering with last winter 's polyethylene covers , three or four wrecked cars  | stalled in the backyard . Aluminum siding and rusting trailers are neighbor to the indigenous  --  a few beautiful old houses built with cobblestones from Lake Ontario . Most houses lack the need for pretensions . One has a car engine tied up to a tree in the front yard , presumably for repair ; it sways in the wind , eerily resembling a deer carcass from afar , except it does n't rot and stays there for more than a year . On weekends , all manner of junk is exhibited on front lawns , for sale cheap . Some lawns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen sink , a perpetual yard sale . Though our new address is Penn Yan ( equitably named for that town 's early mix of immigrants from Pennsylvania and New England ) , we 're nearly as far from Penn Yan as from Geneva . There is no gathered village out here , just dirt roads running off the highway into the trees where a dozen houses stake a row against the lake . The railroad runs just yards behind them , built so close to shore , originally , to make it a tourist draw for passengers traveling up from Watkins Glen . Now it carries two or three freight trains a day , startling the cupboards and floorboards into motion and substantially reducing the value of lakefront property . There 's lots for sale up here , and property stays on the market for years . With just a two-year initial contract at the college , people warned us not to buy a house , even though we could have gotten one for almost nothing  --  the problem would be unloading it later . A damaged economy spackles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sale " signs and sagging , unused barns . On the road we drive to Geneva there are but a handful of businesses : a hazardously smoky convenience shop appended to what 's called Darwin 's Motel  --  five doorways in a peeling white box  --  which gradually metamorphoses into Dar-win 's Flea Market ; a tiny restaurant , Chi Chi 's Kashong Inn , that we fail to try before it closes ; a gas station that warns " Last Gas Stop " ? till what ? ; Fredie 's sic Shack , whose sign always says  | " Open , " though it rarely is ; and , ludicrously , two tropical fish shops in view of the cold lake , shoulder to shoulder . But back here : a strip bound by railroad tracks and lake , a narrow slice of verdant territory . Burrowed and denned , home to deer and woodchucks . Construction site to woodpeckers . Ours to inhabit for a while . Embraceable . Knowable . " Paradise " comes from the Old Persian word for " enclo-sure , " and gardens derive from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people need graspable space . We sit around the campfire , ring-around-the-rosy , make of ourselves a boundary , create places . More concretely , we surround ourselves with walls and bushes , make our homes a private paradise , even though we know the fragility of the enterprise  --  the twilight glimpse of Hooker Chemical cars rumbling just yards from the kitchen window . It is not insignificant that the traditional god of the garden has over the years evolved into the scarecrow . Making a place . I want to do it consciously , with the best of intentions . Geographer Yi-Fu Tuan , a notable explorer of the notion of place , says : " If we think of space as that which allows movement , then place is pause ; each pause in movement makes it possible for location to be transformed into place . " I do n't walk too far afield yet . I hold still to listen and look : gurgle of brook and cowbirds in the cottonwoods , a southern border ; geese at dusk whining their way diagonally across the yard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the edge of distance . But under sun , moon , or steel-plate gray of weather , my eye returns always to the lake , the center that for the moment defines this place for me . I pause . Late dusk . Driving home from teaching , fatigued . Suddenly in the headlights , a woman , white-haired , on the other side of the road , not hitchhiking exactly  --  improbable  --  but waving ( hailing ? ) and at the last moment 's sixty-miles-per-hour glimpse , blood streaming from her left eye . Can this be true ? My foot , disbelieving , stays frozen on the accelerator .  | By the time I pull over and U-turn back , minutes have passed , and when I get to where I think she was , there 's no trace of her . No wrecked car , no pool of blood . A hallucination . Or she 's been saved  --  though I passed no one going the other direction , saw no headlights from behind . I search for some way to confirm her reality , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was . But I can find nothing . Next evening I check the local paper for news  --  nothing . So that I do not know if I failed her , or dreamed her up out of the dusk , a nightmare vision , a test . For which I failed to pause .. . After years of pursuing myself through the world , I am ready to pause , to arrive once more , as in Ireland , at a here , and stay long enough so that " here " is all that need be said . I want to recognize my neighbors , not wake up in the morning and squint trying to remember where I am , not hesitate wondering how to answer when asked where I 'm from . I have no original " from " of any lastingness , nor have I made myself one . Even my parents have been moving every couple of years for the past decade . What does " hometown " mean anymore ? I want to stop the rolling camera . I want a close-up , a still life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of planted bulbs cresting our first April , the yard an unknown repository of care until now , patch by patch , the hands of its past tenders show up as crocus , jonquil , tulip , iris . Flowers chosen to bloom and fade , bloom and fade , each week as spring unfolds . A kind of map , perhaps , to lead us into the life of the place . All we know so far is something of the house itself  --  built in the twenties , lived in by just one family until they rented it to us , so that for our neighbors it will never be ours , but " the Smith house " ? our truest address . Of the land itself , what can we discover beyond the graceful eye Mrs. Smith had for placing flowers ? What 's happened here ? Who stalked deer , who first cleared the land , what stories attach to that  | pierced rock jutting into the water , that tree growing perpendicular to the cliff , the smelt-running creeks , the whalebacked mound of rock offshore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woods and tell us what in another place would be subject of song and legend  --  oh whale who wandered from the sea , stalled in lake water , turned to stone ... ? the landscape brought to life as story . I need to learn the plot and poetry of this place , the outlines of time passing on it , in order that it not be merely scenery . But my neighbors are reticent , sedentary . They mumble and nod the rare times we pass on the road . No one , as in my rural fantasy , has come by with a welcoming plate of homemade cookies , with chat and advice , not to speak of legends . By nightfall , their houses give off the platinum glow of television . We 're left to our own devices . No doubt , for the Seneca Indians who once lived here , the land was full of stories . But they are banished , silent . It will be hard to find their traces . A landscape reflects the history , for the most part , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is defined by their absence . In acclimating myself to Ireland years ago , I relied on the centuries of stories the land told  --  every path and crag resonant with the history of what had happened on it , retold to children and newcomers each time it was passed : the rocks of shipwreck , the coves of drownings , the fields of killings , the beaches of seduction . All over Ireland , it 's been said , people will point to large flat rocks and identify them as " beds " of Grainne and Diarmait , those famous lovers of mythology who slept their way across the country while pursued by Grainne 's rightful fiance . So powerful is the association that a young woman , asked by a male tourist to show him the site of such a bed , will decline with a blush , taking it for a proposition . For the Pueblo , too , says Leslie Silko , stories are firmly attached to the land , always told as people pass the place where they happened . The date of the incident is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events , but they also inadvertently provide crucial geographical information , and thus function as maps . The land 's history guides . And it can do so quite literally . Among the Western Apache , for instance , it serves as a concrete moral force . Anthropologist Keith Basso describes as example how a chain of incidents turns the landscape into teacher . A young woman , just returned to the reservation from boarding school , wears curlers in her hair during a sacred ceremony to which women traditionally wear their hair loose . Nothing is said at the time , though there are disapproving glances . But at a party two weeks later , her grandmother , seemingly out of the blue , casually tells a story  --  about a man who once lived atop a nearby hill , a man who had allied himself with whites against a fellow Apache . The young woman abruptly leaves the gathering , stricken , and her grandmother explains , " I shot her with an arrow . " Basso does n't understand what 's happened , but two years later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his car , passing the hill connected with the grandmother 's story . He asks her about that night , the meaning of the story , and her response . She simply points to the hill and says , " I know that place . It stalks me every day . " Still perplexed , Basso finally asks an elder , who explains that the grandmother , and her story 's implicit warning against betraying Apache culture , are now permanently evoked for the young woman by the presence of the nearby hill . Her flouting of tradition had been likened by the grandmother to a kind of treason . By remembering the story whenever she sees the hill where it took place , she is continually guided by her grandmother , reminded of how she should behave . " You wo n't forget that story , " he says . " You 're going to see the place where it happened , maybe every day .... If you do n't see it , you 're going to hear its name and see it in your mind . It does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep on stalking you like the one who shot you with the story . Maybe that person will die . Even so , that place will keep on stalking you . It 's like that person is still alive . " The landscape , then , embodies the voice of ancestors , is myth and history , is practical , moral advice . Human foibles recur  --  it happened before , right there . Take note . Marshall McLuhan once described the advisory function of myths and epics as the ancient equivalent of Ann Landers . Here that role is extended to include the land itself ; the landscape acts as a cultural binding force understood as almost literally alive . Thus one can say , as the Apache do , " The land looks after us : ' For people like the Apache to be displaced from their territory would mean losing the " indispensable mnemonic pegs on which to hang the moral teachings of their history . " That , for me , is a compelling ideal  --  the landscape as true repository , the cultural and spiritual revelations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees you can touch , the past made visible , a family tree , and the future into which you can confidently walk . The need for an identity rooted in a known place is evident in almost all cultures . Among some people , says Amos Rapoport , " anyone who leaves his native region is treated as dead and receives funeral rites ; exile is equivalent to a death sentence . " A South African Ronga ritual expresses well the deep identification most people in the world make with their native land : a man , marrying a woman from another region , will first bring her some earth from his home . " The woman must eat a little of it every day in her porridge , in order to accustom herself to her new abode . This earth provides the transition between the two domiciles . " To leave the home place , to abandon one 's ancestors , is repugnant to most peoples , though in many cultures women are frequently called upon , by marriage , to do just that . I 've wandered far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel  | adrift up here in Geneva . No nibbler of soil , I study the map , try to place myself through roads and the names of upstate towns : Troy , Rome , Syracuse , Ithaca , Romulus , Ovid , a Ulysses , and a Hector  --  all right here in New York State . No wonder I 'm so confused . The classical zeal of New York 's early settlers feels comic now . For them , the lightness of the Indians ' touch , the near invisibility of the long pre-Columbian occupation , meant the continent was a blank page on which they could compose from scratch . They energetically humanized the socalled wilderness with what they knew and admired  --  cultural mementos of the Old World that could n't have been more remote and irrelevant . They left us place-names that reveal nothing of the place itself , only evidence of their own homesickness and intellectual pretensions . In this , New York 's settlers initiated a national tradition  --  classical names spread wildly from New York State to the rest of the country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old-world spin-offs like Geneva : our lakeside , but not-at-all-alpine , town . The settlers ' impulse is understandable . Names tame the chaotic , reorient . They are the quickest way to take possession of a new land , to make oneself at home . Importing a name from one 's previous home provides a crucial sense of familiarity . Even the Masai of Kenya , forced to relocate , took the names of the hills and rivers of their territory with them and transplanted them into a new topography . And I confess to sometimes imagining my view of the eastern shore of Seneca Lake as the Connemara coast I stared at for five years from my Irish island . But in declining upstate New York , transplanted European names echo more and more ironically . After living here only a few months , hearing on the radio that a meeting of Nobel prize  --  winning scientists is taking place in Geneva , I gasp with pleasure , then wonder where they 're staying  --  at the town 's one hostelry , a dilapidated motel on Routes 5 &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Geneva .  | Nearby towns like Victor and Waterloo are shadowed by older names , of course . Gaosagao : In the Basswood Country . Skoiyase : Long Falls . More pleasant associations by far than the battered shade of Napoleon . My brothers , the Indians must always be remembered in this land . Out of our languages we have given names to many beautiful things which will always speak of us . Minnehaha will laugh of us , Seneca will shine in our image , Mississippi will murmur our woes . The name Seneca , in fact , was a Dutch misunderstanding . The Seneca 's true name is Nundawaono , People of the Hill . Apocryphally , a Dutch doctor in search of the People of the Stone , sinnekar in his language , was sent progressively west in his quest and finally , exhausted , attached the name to the natives he found here . The name was transmuted to Seneca and stuck . Even where genuine native names have persisted , as in Canandaigua , they remain awkward loans , mispronounced , misspelled , undecodable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who settled here ( Penn Yan is a notable exception ) , so there 's little connection to the territory through its names  --  the sure way to communicate special features and one of the most intimate ways in which a people can belong to a place ( the national anthem of India is simply a litany of place-names . Here : our local Ithaca so easily achieved by highway between the Charybdis of the lake and the Scylla of the Seneca Army Depot . Americans still ignore the land they 're on when they name places . Housing developments lean Britishly toward courts , manors , mews , and meres . The use of native names has steadily declined  --  shades of the Indians evidently do n't attract buyers to new development frontiers . Rather , " parks " and " gardens " seem to steady the nerves of those venturing from city to suburb . " The practice of giving an attractive name to a prospective colony , " says Arthur Minton , " goes back at least to Eric the Red , who , having found a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would the more readily go there if the country had a good name . ' " The advertiser 's mentality still prevails and has  | resulted in names that are utterly irrelevant to their locations . When embarrassed Levittown , New Jersey , had had enough of its image as a bland replica of Levittowns in New York and Pennsylvania ( the one I spent part of my girlhood in ) , the community itself decided to concoct something tonier ? Willingboro . There 's a general propensity in suburban America for compound names like Wood Crest or Cedar Hill , suggesting that prestige is lent by topographical elevation and woodedness . Most often , though , the trees are n't anywhere to be seen , and the name is a consolation , what David Lowenthal dubs " linguistic landscaping . " A good many of these names are comically para-doxical  --  the country is full of oxymoronic Ridge Dales and Glen Hills , and such high points as Sunken Meadow Heights . Well-known New York City suburb Forest Hills was built on a low-lying tract of reclaimed , treeless land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our desire to prettify the bland with nice names . The nineteenth-century suburbs of London were jeered at for similar pretensions  --  by Byron , for instance , in Don Juan : Through Groves , so call 'd as being void of trees ( Like lucus from no light ) ; through prospects named Mount Pleasant , as containing nought to please , Nor much to climb ... . I spent a good part of my childhood in the New Jersey suburb of Cherry Hill , which was flat as a pancake and home to no cherry trees . With such deliberate obfuscations , how can one decipher the land 's biography , the signature of those who have lived on it ? If our place-names insist we reside on hills and crests , do we stop seeing the flat horizon of our lives ? Do we notice there are no elms or cedars in our Elmhursts and Cedar Parks ? With the  | land misnamed and chaotically cluttered , where can we find glimpses of how it was once lived on ? We hardly know what to look for , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lesson from the Australian aborigines . Amos Rapoport : " Many Europeans have spoken of the uniformity and featurelessness of the Australian landscape . The aborigines , however , see the landscape in a totally different way . Every feature of the landscape is known and has meaning  --  they then perceive differences which the European can not see . These differences may be in terms of detail or in terms of a magical and invisible landscape , the symbolic landscape being even more varied than the perceived physical space . " The distinguishable , symbolic landscape is the mythic territory of their ancestral gods . In aboriginal belief , the deities entered a void landscape and made the hills and trees and rivers . Wherever they walked they left their mark on the land ; where they plunged their sacred poles , wells formed . The pathways they left tell the stories of their adventures . The repeated , ritualistic walking of these sacred pathways by generations of aborigines , and the singing of their associated stories , has made this symbolic landscape more " real " than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tracks , or the footprints of the ancestors . Everyone is assigned a totem songline at birth . The preservation of the stanzas of one 's song and the land they cross is a lifetime responsibility and a spiritual link to the " dreamtime , " when the ancestors wandered the continent " singing the world into existence , " as Bruce Chatwin lyrically describes it , obviously as attracted to the notion as I am  --  it 's a moving metaphor for a writer . " Each totemic ancestor , while traveling through the country , was thought to have scattered a trail of words and musical notes along the line of his foot-prints , " Chatwin explains . The song survives as a map to the sacred territory . Hundreds of such songlines crisscross the Aus-  | tralian continent , their topography and stories known only to initiates . " In theory , at least , the whole of Australia could be read as a musical score . " That 's an imaginative vision most would be quick to dismiss when speaking of mere land . A culture teaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what to ignore . Mountains , for instance , were for centuries shunned by Europeans as being hideous . Until Petrarch climbed one and experienced with the vista an expanded sense of self , and until Rousseau argued that mountain peaks were spiritually uplifting , travelers across the Alps would keep their carriage blinds down . Of this country , Henry James wrote in 1879 , not untypically , that " History , as yet , has left in the United States but so thin and impalpable a deposit that we very soon touch the hard substratum of nature . " For " history " read " colonial history . " The supposedly raw and unstoried wilderness of North America dismayed most European settlers . But how hard is nature itself to fall back on ? It 's only in recent times that we 've begun to regard the natural world as profane , inexpressive . Throughout human history , people have consistently made symbols out of natural terrain .

We need reading lessons . From the air , I 've always felt I understood the fundamental  | conflict between the Irish and British by looking at how their land is arranged . The tidy evenness of England 's squared fields evokes politeness  --  the steady grace of iambic pentameter , containment , control  --  whereas the unruly , wavering , pitchfork-fought-over boundaries between Irish fields , their shapes jagged with defiance , embody the ungovernable wild spunk of the Irish , the quick-shifting registers of their music .

I read the landscape to help me through , to know what 's come before me there , to find my footing in time . The land can speak us back to ourselves , a kind of autobiography . To see it as mere scenery is like looking at the closed cover of a book . My project is to find what 's legible here .

Farther up the road , another sign declares this road , which the map calls simply Route 414 , the " Military Trail . " I hurry back to the library , my curiosity stung . General John Sullivan : chosen by George Washington to lead a major expedition into New York State . The aim of what 's come to be known as the Sullivan campaign : the destruction of the Iroquois Indians . The Iroquois had hoped to remain neutral in the Revolutionary War but were pressured into alliances that divided their six-nation League . Two tribes joined with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British , who were well entrenched in the region and had earlier been their allies against the French . The Seneca reluctantly allowed the British to build a palisaded fort to use as a supply depot at the major village of Ganundasaga  --  the site of which would become Geneva . Ganundasaga was the staging point for several assaults in which the Iroquois participated , notably the massacres in the towns of Wyoming , Pennsylvania , and Cherry Valley , New York , which the Sullivan campaign was meant to avenge . In late August 1779 , more than 3,000 artillery-laden soldiers of the Patriot army converged near present-day Elmira and met their enemy ? 750 Iroquois and Loyalists . Sullivan 's offensive was three-pronged , carefully prepared , well armed and financed . British and Iroquois preparations had been hasty , unrealistic . When the Indians were fired on and saw how overwhelmed in numbers they were , they quickly fled in panic , only intermittently harassing Sullivan 's army as it triumphantly marched up the east side of Seneca Lake , on the trail I 've just been driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catherine 's Town , Condawhaw , Kendaia . . . only historical markers show where the old villages stood . Sul-livan 's men moved relentlessly north , discovering day after day the abandoned villages of the Seneca and Cayuga nations . They burned everything they found that could sustain life .  | And what a life it was they found . Sullivan 's men left journals rhapsodizing over the land they plundered . They described corn in the fields so tall that " a man riding through it on horseback would be hidden from sight , " corn with eighteen-foot-high stalks and ears twenty inches long . Cornfields extended for miles around the villages . There were huge apple , peach , and plum orchards  --  fruits adopted from earlier European visitors  --  trees thick with ripe fruit . Nothing they 'd seen in the coastal colonies compared with the fecundity they found here . " A veritable Eden , " they called it . All was destroyed . Along with the villages , entire fields of ripe , standing corn were burned ; granaries of stored corn , beans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the orchards were cut down . As historian Barbara Graymont wryly notes , " the business of this campaign would prove a strange task indeed for men at arms  --  a warfare against vegetables . " Who 'd have thought they 'd find such bounty ?

" And though corn was the Iroquois ' staple , huge amounts of squash and beans were also grown , along with pumpkins , sunflowers ( for their oil ) , thick-rinded gourds that could be used as containers , Jerusalem artichokes , melons , and cucumbers . Sweet corn was reportedly unknown to colonists until Sullivan 's army found it here in Seneca fields . For the Iroquois , corn , beans , and squash held a special place in the diet and mythology . Grown together they constituted what was known as the Three Sisters , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first woman on earth . Lewis Henry Morgan , who published the classic study of the Iroquois in 1851 , reports that the spirits of these vegetables were imagined as three beautiful women who were " very fond of each other . " They were known collectively as Deohako , Our Life or Our  | Supporters , and were never mentioned separately , having no individual names . The crops were cultivated together in small hills , a technique still , for practical reasons , recommended in gardening handbooks and practiced locally  --  the bean vines can climb into the sun on the cornstalks instead of stakes , and the squash sprawls happily over the ground between corn and beans , its tangled vines discouraging incursions by raccoon and deer . Companion planting also acts as a natural pesticide . The Indians Sullivan had been sent to conquer were a lot more sophisticated , it turns out , than we 've been taught to think . The Iroquois had for centuries inhabited all of upstate New York , parts of Pennsylvania , and eastern Ohio . Their own name for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People of the Longhouse , in recognition of their much admired sixty- to one-hundred-foot-long bark houses that were home to several families . The longhouse , as well as being a practical home to an extended family , was also the symbol of the Iroquois League , a confederacy of five distinct tribal nations  --  the Mohawk , Oneida , Onondaga , Cayuga , and Seneca ( later , with the addition of the Tuscarora , six ) . The tribes of the League envisioned their territories as bridged by pact into a figurative longhouse , the sky its ceiling , the earth its floor , each tribe a " fire " ? a family hearth  --  within the extended household . The Seneca , who lived in the territory I 've moved into , were the largest tribe of the group , their numbers perhaps greater than the other four tribes combined . And they were logistically crucial , situated at the western end of the symbolic longhouse , west from Seneca Lake all the way to Ohio . They were thus known as " the keepers of the western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood almost literally , as when in 1652 the Mohawk , keepers of the eastern door , jealous about direct trade between Canada and the Onondaga across Lake Ontario , warned the French :  | Is not the door the proper entrance to the house , and not the chimney or the roof of the cabin , unless the visitor be a thief and wishes to surprise the people ? We constitute but one house , we five Iroquois nations , we build but one fire and we have through all time dwelt under the same roof . Well , then , will you not enter the cabin by the door , which is on the ground floor of the house ? It is with us , the Mohawks , that you should begin . You would enter by the roof and by the chimney if you begin with the Onondagas . Have you no fear lest the smoke may blind you , our fire not being extinguished ? Do you not fear to fall from the top to the bottom having nothing solid whereon to plant your feet ? This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fragmentations of contemporary Iroquois reservation geography . When a group of Navajo recently came to Onondaga to speak to the League about their own territorial crisis , they entered Iroquois territory as tradition demanded  --  through the western door of a Seneca reservation , to be properly greeted and escorted to the house 's central hearth , kept by the Onondaga , now in the midst of industrial Syracuse . The Iroquois League was a political organization so astutely developed that Governor Clinton of New York famously termed the Iroquois " the Romans of the West " ( though Clinton was also a prime instigator of the Sullivan campaign , and his brother was second in command ) . With detailed procedures for replacing leaders and guaranteeing equity , the Iroquois maintained a remarkably peaceful balance among themselves for many centuries . The framers of the U.S. Constitution are now thought to have been inspired by their laws and principles . Benjamin Franklin early on championed the Iroquois model  | when he presented the Plan of Union to the Albany Congress in 1754 : " It would be a strange thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forming such a union . . . and yet a like union should be impractical for ten or a dozen English colonies . " Some have called the League the world 's first United Nations . The Iroquois preserve the League 's origins in the myth of Deganawida , usually called simply the Peacemaker , a visionary born of a virgin , who along with Hiawatha brought the nations into their unusual alliance . Most versions have it that Hiawa-tha 's daughters had all been killed and he was inconsolable . ( " He threw himself about as if tortured . . . no one came near him , so awful was his sorrow . " ) It 's said , too , that years of intertribal strife and revenge warfare had left the Iroquois inured to death . So Hiawatha wandered away alone in his grief until he met Deganawida , who consoled him and converted him to a vision of peace built around a ritual of condolence . Now when a person is in deep grief the tears blind his eyes and he can not see . By these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you may again see . When a person is mourning the loss of a loved one his ears are stopped and he can not hear . By these words we remove that obstruction so that you may again hear . The ritual of condolence became a mechanism for communal peace as Deganawida and Hiawatha traveled among the Iroquois promoting it as a means of comforting the bereaved and thus ending the habit of revenge killings ( " mourning war " ) . Because the ceremony heals intertribal griefs , explains Christopher Vecsey , " condolence " became the equivalent of " alliance " in Iroquois thinking . The condolence ceremony also helps ensure the allied League 's stability by simultaneously mourning a chief 's death while investing his successor . Since our brother has died the light has dropped from the sky . We now lift up the light and replace it in the sky .  | The foundation date of this deliberate , humane league is disputed , but certainly antedates European contact . Most scholars estimate its origins between the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries . Cars now rumble along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , enlightened but burdened by what I 've learned . The scorched land has revived itself , though it took a generation or more for some of it to become fertile again . Now it is littered with abandoned farms and gas stations , leaning barns . Though near Valois : " Gadiodjiyada  --  a Peach Orchard Where Sullivan Camped September 3 , 1779 , " and there it still stands , broadtrunked knobby peach trees perfectly aligned , a glimpse of lake at the end of each corridor , branches twittering in the breeze , an orchard of ghosts . It took days for the army to march this route that 's now a half-hour drive . By the time they reached Ganundasaga , the population of four to six hundred had fled , though only just ? valuables were abandoned , food was left cooking over fires . The village 's sixty or seventy bark huts , log buildings , and huge stores of food were burned by Sullivan 's men on September 8 , 1779 , and the residents of Ganundasaga joined two to three thousand other displaced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been forced to migrate in a matter of days . Most sought refuge at English military installations up by Lake Erie , but the British were unable , or unwilling , to accommodate their stricken native allies , and the winter that followed was the most severe in memory . Hundreds are said to have died of starvation , scurvy , dysentery , and exposure . All told , by the end of the war , the Iroquois population had been halved ( in the seventeenth century it had already been halved by smallpox epidemics , the virus carried in by missionaries ) . Indian habitation of central New York had been virtually eliminated ; where there had been thirty thriving villages , there were now two . " I flatter myself , " Sullivan  | reported to Congress , " that the orders with which I was entrusted are fully executed . " The orders , direct from George Washington , had been that the land of the six nations not be " merely overrun but destroyed . " " Have we , the first holders of this prosperous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " intoned Cayuga chief Peter Wilson fewer than seventy years later : Glad were your fathers to sit upon the threshold of the Long House , rich did they then hold themselves in getting the mere sweeping from its door . Had our forefathers spurned you from it when the French were thundering at the opposite end to get a passage through and drive you into the sea ? Whatever has been the fate of other Indians , the Iroquois might still have been a nation ; and I instead of pleading for the privilege of living within your borders  --  I ? I might have had a country ! When Britain made peace with the United States in 1.783 , no provision was made for the Iroquois . And when , the next year , the Treaty of Fort Stanwix was signed , it included major Iroquois land cessions , ensuring the virtual termination of the League 's political existence . Seneca chief Red Jacket is well remembered for his eloquence about the consequences  --  though he was one of those who negotiated the treaty : We stand a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are encircled  --  we are encompassed . The evil spirit rides upon the blast , and the waters are disturbed . They rise , they press upon us , and the waves once settled over us , we disappear forever . Who then lives to mourn us ? ? None . What marks our extinction ? ? Nothing . We are mingled with the common elements .  | It is in the common land that I search for the spirit of the Iroquois now . Conquered , virtually denuded , the land was wide open for settlers , and a number of Sullivan 's soldiers , who had seen it in its glory , were among the first to move in . Some of the decapitated orchards sprouted new trees , six or seven from a single root , and within fifteen years settlers were making a bundle off the fruit . When one John McIntosh found a wonderfully sweet apple growing here , supposedly wild , he named it after him-self  --  an appropriation as lasting as other colonial rebaptisms of Iroquois land . Hector , Ulysses , Scipio , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seneca Lake commemorate bloodshed . For here are the so-called military tracts , the six-hundred-acre gridiron parcels into which the land was carved to reward the soldiers who 'd fought in the Revolution . As it happened , most of the rewarded soldiers sold their plots to speculators without having ever seen them . But the gridded fields survive , and the twenty-eight tracts remain as a shadowy underpinning . They are the basis of contemporary township borders , cut at right angles across the rolling land , indifferent to streams and hills , dividing local governments into illogical units  --  a prototype for the great carving up of America with " remorseless rectangularity , " as geographer Wilbur Zelinsky describes it , " and with the greatest possible disregard for the sphericity of the earth and the variable qualities of its surface . " The U.S. Land Ordinance Act of 1785 , which followed local examples like upstate New York in dividing vast tracts of the American landscape into standard-sized farms , has been thought of as part and parcel of American democracy . J. B. Jackson , that great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of equality of opportunity countrywide , the symbol of a Jeffersonian agrarian utopia . But one can also read an imperialist underside to it . Historically , the other great makers  | of grids were the Romans , the Chinese , and the Spanish in the Americas  --  in each case colonizers , highly centralized powers with a pressing need to organize large areas ' of land . And as Tocqueville , worrying about the future of American democracy , said : " Every central government worships uniformity . " The grid plan made it possible to lay out land in advance of its settle-ment  --  a peculiarly abstract exercise  --  and for speculators to buy and sell it sight unseen . The system was a cheap and easy way to identify parcels ; its mathematical regularity reduced border disputes ; and record keepers knew where everyone was , what they owned . It guaranteed " coherence " in the settlement pattern  --  a very much controlled plan for settling the frontier despite our myth of individualism . And not everyone ended up with an equal square , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , profited . Grids also created a maddeningly dull aesthetic for the land , which we 've not yet been able to shake . The roads I drive here are for the most part the perfectly aligned boundaries between rectangular fields ; the corners I turn are right angles . Cars zip across perpendiculars , toys on a board . I quickly become so used to this configuration that I 'm surprised to hear a friend from Massachusetts complain about the tedious linearity of my daily commute . The pattern here , as in much of the country , is a given , and a striking reminder of how this land was settled following the Revolution . Both east and west of Seneca Lake , huge waves of settlers , inspired by early reports , arrived to tame the land with alarmingly quick success . Hillsides were cleared by burning so vigorously that some compared the landscape in those years to a crematorium or to Hades ? " None would suspect that these workers in fire and smoke had anything in common with tillers of the soil . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of oxen could , in four or five weeks , clear , fence , and sow ten acres and build a comfortable house as well . The newly cleared land  | yielded bumper crops . But when crops were n't rotated , the soil failed , so more land was cleared . The logging industry took care of what the farmers did n't , and the countryside was soon almost entirely stripped of trees . Those first-growth trees were giants by our current standards , many comparable to California redwoods . Only a few were left , as markers , or to shade a farmhouse . An observer in 1810 wrote : " As I stand on the hilltop , the farms are mosaiced up to the river bank and even through the deepest wrinkles in the anatomy of land . As for the trees , as far as my eye can reach , I can count them on my two hands . " The local Indians had also slashed and burned forests to clear farmland ; but about every ten years , as the soil and firewood supply became exhausted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or so in order to let the land recover . They did have population on their side . Iroquois numbers , though not known exactly , were probably never greater than 25,000 , a population the region could easily sustain . Their abandoned land restored itself fairly quickly , and so accommodated both them and the deer they needed to hunt . The new European population west of Seneca Lake boomed from i , 000 in 1797 to perhaps 300,000 by 181o . And the ambitions of the new settlers were great . So successful were their farms that for a time the area 's fecundity and strategic location on waterways made it the breadbasket of the developing nation . Food was exported to the entire East Coast and even to Europe . Fresh fruit and wheat were available in greater quantities than even the well-developed transportation network could handle , so thirteen distilleries were busy processing the surplus in Geneva by the early nineteenth century . " No army in the history of the world , " extols agricultural historian Ulysses Hedrick , " has made conquests of so great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forests of New York into farms during the half century that followed the American Revolution . "  | But the greed of the farming ensured the region 's quick demise . As early as 1791 , George Washington wrote , " The aim of the farmers in this country ( if they can be called farmers ) , is , not to make the most they can from the land , which is or has been cheap , but the most of the labour , which is dear ; the consequence of which has been , much ground has been scratched over and none cultivated or improved as it ought to have been . " Letters to the editors of local newspapers urged crop rotation , ample sowings of clover for cover , and reforestation too , but their prophetic advice was ignored . Attitudes were probably something like those still being expressed by a group of West Texas cattlemen a century later : " Resolved , that none of us know , or care to know , anything about grasses , native or otherwise , outside the fact that for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on record , and we are after getting the most out of them while they last . " By the middle of the nineteenth century , New York 's wheat fields were being devastated by the midge ( an attack prepared for by earlier failures of manage-ment ) , and major cultivation of grain had moved to the Midwest . The people had moved too . They had surprisingly little loyalty to the region they had pioneered . An English traveler was startled to observe that " There is as yet in New England and New York scarcely any such thing as local attachments  --  the love of a place because it is a man 's own  --  because he has hewed it out of the wilderness , and made it what it is or because his father did so , and he and his family have been born and brought up , and spent their happy youthful days upon it . Speaking generally , every farm from Eastport in Maine to Buffalo on Lake Erie , is for sale . " The region 's brief heyday did impressive damage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though it 's thought that deer had been native to the area since 4000 B.C. Loss of habitat and overkilling had also eliminated wild turkeys , beavers , wolves , eagles , elk , bobcats , and the now-extinct passenger pigeon ,  | flocks of which had once blackened the sky for hours at a time each spring and fall . Early visitors mistook the roar of their migrations for tornadoes . Squirrels existed in like numbers ? " Any tolerable marksman could go out to Fort Hill of a morning and bring in as many as he could conveniently carry , before breakfast . " Destruction of animals was encouraged to prevent any return of the " hunter class " ( Indians ) . Bounties awarded for killing wolves cost struggling young towns tens of thousands of dollars . So great was the effect of these settlers that , despite the sprawling development of towns in recent decades , the quality of natural life here has in fact improved significantly since the nineteenth century . A quarter of all the settlers ' farms were abandoned by 1925 , their tools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to trip and wonder over . Farms , which previously accounted for seventy percent of the land , now constitute fifteen or twenty percent . Gradually , the land has come closer to its prerevolutionary state . Deer have returned , found sumac , dogwood , and apples in the revived orchards . Wild turkeys ( with the help of the state trap-and-transfer program ) have come back to find abundant cover , nuts , and berries . Seventy percent of the land is again forested , enough to support a high population of wildlife . I look for evidence : on the way into town , lawns just barely rescued from the woods , fertilized and trimmed , enormous expanses dwarfing the typical three-bedroom ranch , grass studded with replicas of those animals home owners would drive off if they dared wander in  --  the ubiquitous chubby plastic deer , the newfangled fabric geese set on posts so that they swivel and billow with the breeze , seemingly nodding , but never soiling the grass , and chic , upscale polyester-stuffed sheep , life-size . Plywood wells complete the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a woman 's capacious hips covered by a polka-dot dress , poised as if to pull a weed from a flower  | bed , bloomers peeking beneath the hem , always for a moment wincingly realistic . Because I now do too much driving through the world instead of walking , I see plastic and plywood far more often than the real thing . On the road , I only rarely glimpse a live shuffling woodchuck or dreaming pheasant . More often , tracks , a fleeting white tail , or in twilight , the detached orange slits of eyes that waver in front of my headlights , unreal as the front-lawn phantoms . In the morning , road kills border the grass  --  raccoon , possum , rabbit , crumpled doe . Despite the carnage of cars and hunting , we 're assured by officials that forest dwellers are prospering , that there are in fact too many deer here for their own good  --  that 's another story . But what of the fish in the lakes ? " A handsome sheet of wholesome water , " one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult not to believe the beautiful healthy . Given the lake 's grace and size and lively shifts of mood , it 's natural to think it full of treasure . ( How I 've come to cherish its daily dramatics , its blessings of spray , its calming of the eye like a poultice . ) True that it 's ringed by highways and railroad tracks , that it suffers chemical runoff from farms , is tainted with pesticides and PCBs . Still , the lakeshore has been little enough spoiled that it harbors nearly extinct flora  --  one of the last surviving colonies of Leedy 's Roseroot is here , a cliffdwelling , flowering plant that came with the glaciers ten thousand years ago , flourished across the northern part of the continent , and then all but vanished as the glaciers retreated . The lake has been an important source of fish for longer than we know . The earliest sign of habitation beside it is a fishing camp apparently used by Indians around 2500 B.C. The wealth of Seneca Lake 's fish is such that a New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for three-pound perch and twenty-pound northern pike . Geneva , though , prides itself most on the lake 's abundant trout , and even posts a sign  | at the entrance of the town , declaring itself " The Lake Trout Capital of the World . " Does n't a place have to be inspected before committing such claims to billboard paint ? Geneva has as substantiation , at least , an annual trout derby on Memorial Day weekend that draws more than two thousand fishermen ( the lake suddenly garbled with boats and wake ) . But it turns out that even the much-touted trout are dependent on New York State 's restocking program : " natural reproduction of all important coldwater species is either nonexistent or inade-quate . " Twenty-pounders were often caught in the old days ; the all-time record is thirty-two pounds . Divers say the big ones are still down there  --  hiding out in the depths . I was excited to hear about the trout , kept looking for them at local stores , but with no success . There were plenty of boats out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond the end of our dock . So we briefly took up fishing ourselves , three weekends in a row , each Saturday morning going into town for tackle and bait , rowing out to where we thought we 'd seen the locals lingering , each Saturday afternoon having lost all our equipment to unfamiliar weeds , deciding to try again next week . I finally asked my neighbors where I could buy fish and discovered that as with most sporting fish in New York State , because of high pollution levels in the lakes , they 're not permitted to be sold . Even if you 're lucky enough to catch them yourself , New York recommends you eat no more than one meal per week from any water in the state , and none at all if you 're a woman of childbearing age or a child under fifteen . So much for being fed by the lake in any literal way . If we were n't fortunate enough to be living beside it , there would be few enough places we 'd even be able to get access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the chance to muse . Over time , it has yielded its myths : monsters sighted , hoaxed into existence , or actually caught  --  heart-stopping giant sturgeons , for in-  | stance . And oddities suggesting communication with the sea are still periodically nabbed and bragged of , as in this yellowed newspaper clipping I found : The theory advanced by prominent scientists and geographers that Seneca Lake , that wonderful body of water , whose phenomena are inexplicable , is connected by some underground or subterranean passage with larger and presumably saline bodies of water , has been again and peculiarly substantiated . However much the doubting Thomases may cavil and sneer at the supposition that there exists such a passage , the incontrovertible and substantial facts still remain . No less a person than E.C . Havens , trustee of the village of Watkins and a prominent druggist , vouches for the following facts . During a fishing excursion down Seneca Lake , Mr. Havens witnessed the capture of a strange and peculiar species of the piscatorial tribe . This fish was of the general form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The fish possessed a mouth with a hooked lower jaw ... the jaws were supplied with teeth which were pointed backward , indicating that the fish was used to feeding on the larger form of the finny species . . . . Research by local scholars reveals the fact that the only fish which approaches the description of this one is the species Mustelus hinnulus . This fish is known by several names such as smoothhound , skate tooth shark and raytooth dog , the two latter titles being appropriately given on account of its curious and beautifully formed teeth . The habitat of this species of the shark tribe is the waters off .. .  | Here the clipping beguilingly ends , torn . But we get the point . And the point seems to have been made every decade or so , leaving those of us with little knowledge of the " piscatorial tribe " to merely nod , wide-eyed . The lake 's direst legend is that it refuses to give up its dead . The drowned are held fast , or turn up in other Finger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold and deep that bodies do n't bloat , do n't rise to the surface . The lake may be littered with dead . Rochester journalist Arch Merrill added comically to the lake 's lore in recent years , reporting that because it only rarely freezes , some have claimed that " Seneca water , placed in an automobile radiator , makes a sure-fire anti-freeze . " Well , I would n't trust my car to that one . As for the lake being bottomless , my colleague at the college , Bill Ahrnsbrak , putters around in his research boat and says there 's always a bottom on the meter . I ask him instead about the mysterious , quick tides . Ahrnsbrak holds a whiskey bottle horizontally in front of me ; it 's half-filled with water , a layer of Mazola oil floating on top . He sloshes it back and forth , illustrating long waves . The top seventy-five or one hundred feet of the lake , he says , are warmer , lower in density , and float atop the deeper , colder water . Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created . The wave moves so quickly it can travel the length of the lake ( nearly forty miles ) in half an hour . As the wave passes , the temperature in the water drops twenty-five degrees . See ? He tilts the bottle . All I see is sloshing water and oil , enough to make me feel seasick . What makes the wave start ? Why does it happen here but not in the other lakes ? Well , no one 's entirely sure , he admits , but it happens in a handful of lakes that are deep and long and narrow like Seneca and where there 's a large temperature difference between the surface and the depths . It also happens in Loch Ness .  | Stories like this make the lake a dramatic , compelling presence . Windy days it threatens the docks , turns into a vengeful sea . Summer evenings it can be so still , to dive into it is to send out shuddering rings as far as the eye can follow . Winter mornings , when its relative warmth hits the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mist . Sunsets , it 's painted with heartbreak . It is , above all , a focus , organizer of the view . I 've come to count on the lake . But geologists casually remind us that lakes are short-lived affairs . The memorized contours of the shore that become dear to us are , in the grand scheme of things , fleeting . Seneca Lake , alive with small changes all the time , has changed radically over the eons . Don Woodrow , another colleague here , finds seashells and lake sediment in soils miles from the current shoreline . It 's thought that the Finger Lakes were at times so high and deep that several of them merged . Woodrow predicts that Seneca Lake will eventually become a mere swamp . The idea pains me . Swampy brown sediments stripe the lake 's deep blues when the creeks are running hard , water rushing through tiny falls , churning uneasily beneath the dock where I often sit . I let myself be mesmerized by the moving water , transfixed by the color shifts of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ridges , something red pricks my eye . On , off , on , off . It takes me weeks to track it down , drive to its source , place it  --  the pulsing lights of the radio tower at the Seneca Army Depot , the sole visible sign of what 's going on across the lake that four miles of nonchalant water can not pretend to distance me from . Though I 'd like to think , as poet Cesare Pavese wrote , that " at night the earth has no owners , " here the night is owned by the army . We 've heard the transport planes coming in and taking off at two or three in the morning , their improbably long , low lumbering down the seven-thousand-foot runway , laden with threat . Pershing missiles , neutron bombs , the lot . From here right to Europe . The radio tower signals us , the world : on  | off on off , yes no yes no , a pole of monstrous fireflies , jittery on and off like the buttons on the consoles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against an unknown competitor , on and off ruthlessly proving aggression , you , me , you , me , everything taken , nothing left . What have we won ? Reportedly the largest depot of nuclear weapons in the eastern half of the country , built on the farmland of Kendaia , once the site of a thriving Seneca village . Kendaia , destroyed by Sullivan  --  a sign posted at the weedy edge of a narrow rest area along the highway all that acknowledges it now  --  a village so well known for its orchards that it was called Apple Town . It was an important tribal center too ? Sullivan 's men noted unusual , gorgeously painted tombs for chiefs buried there . Eleven thousand acres around the former Kendaia are now guarded by more than 250 military police authorized to shoot to kill to keep anyone from approaching the five hundred underground bunkers of bombs there . I think I can see where the bombs are . . . in the Landsat satellite photo sold locally as a poster  --  the big oval ring of the depot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the area 's biggest single swath of land , gouged out like one of the lakes , though not a bit blue . Inside the first ring there 's a second boundary , and there , in telltale lines , are pale brown dots , five clumpings of them , contained and orderly , clearly visible from this extraterrestrial angle , but never from the ground by the likes of us . Helicopters whir round the perimeter of the base to protect it . The sky is crisscrossed by contrails , the distant glint of speeding jets . Dogs roam the barbed-wire fences , and guards peer from towers . Pulling over onto the shoulder of the road is deemed suspi-cious  --  friends have reported the quick swoop of a copter , questioning . The military has been here since 1941 when the depot and Sampson base across the road were built at panic speed . The  | uranium for the Manhattan Project was stored here , and thousands of men boot-camped at Sampson . The army had favored the site 's rural , inland setting and the " all-American " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settled on the land chosen for the depot , though , said they were treated " rottenly . " A number of them got as little as three days ' notice to give up their homes and farms . They raced to harvest what they could from their fields , abandoning the rest to bulldozers in a spirit eerily reminiscent of Sullivan 's march through , 162 years before . Many felt undercompensated for their land , but money was n't their only grievance ? " That black walnut there came up from some nuts dumped on the ground when my girl was young . It 's such things as that get you attached to a place . " Sampson base devoured twenty additional farms , twelve more houses , seventy-five lakefront cottages , and two general stores . Some of the houses seized dated from the first white settlement in the late eighteenth century . And the land included the unusual Indian cemetery that had so impressed Sullivan 's soldiers . The first settlers had vowed to the last of the local Indians that they 'd protect the cemetery . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base , when excavations for a water line intersected the mounds . After the war , the bombs stayed in the so-called igloos , and the navy stayed to work on the lake  --  it 's deep enough to simulate submarine experience . Of that work , we can only see what 's happening on the surface : a huge barge , not far from us , which never moves from its anchor . At night it rolls under a single orange light , my landmark as I drive down from Geneva , time to turn onto the road home . It 's a kind of companion on the emptiness of the water , a stalwart . We can see a few small boats tied up to it , men motoring in and out to shore . Things are going on .

But I imagine that if bombs could sing , this might be their music . All we can see at the depot itself is a herd of odd-looking all-white deer grazing the perimeter fence  --  aberrations , images of our fear . They are not , experts insist , albinos . But they are pure white , and their antlers are heavy and irregular compared with those of other deer . It 's tempting to wonder if they 're victims of radiation . But scientists say they 're a natural mutation that has flourished because the herd is unnaturally restricted within the high fences of the depot . The first white fawn was sighted in 1956 . Now there are hundreds , and none is permitted to be shot . So they are increasingly visible , loveliness behind barbed wire , set into panic by helicopters and transport planes , caged with bombs . They are our heart pang . Or our sci-fi vision of the nuked world , wan , entrapped . They are also the local symbol of the depot .

Though only about six hundred low-skilled jobs are open to locals , the depot is one of the largest employers in impoverished Seneca County , so it is embraced by the community , vociferously defended . For peace groups , it is a focus of demonstrations . A women 's peace encampment , modeled on Greenham Commons , was established near the depot gate in 1983 , and marches through the eighties drew thousands , including peace activists like Dr. Spock , who climbed the depot fence as an act of civil disobedience . But most local people are unquestioning supporters of the military . In 1982 , when the storage of nuclear weapons at the base was indisputably established , only a few citizens raised the issue of an emergency evacuation plan for the area . None has ever been made ; it is probably pointless .  | Nor did anyone say a thing in 1989 when the Environmental Protection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list of the nation 's worst hazardous-waste sites . An investigation focused on a ninety-acre open area where explosives " and related wastes " were burned and detonated for thirty years . Monitored wells revealed unacceptable levels of several carcinogens . As for radiation , no one 's talking . Earlier , the depot apparently managed to get rid of the remains of the Manhattan Project  --  what has been called " the world 's most historic waste " ? by dumping it at Lewiston , just north of Niagara Falls . Niagara County , home of Love Canal , has long been a favorite upstate dumping ground because of its heavy clay soil . Until the seventies , the more than twenty-two thousand tons of radioactive waste used to build the country 's first nuclear bomb took no advantage of that soil , though  --  it was lying about on open ground or sitting in an old water tower . Not until the tower was shown to be emitting radon , and the exposed waste to be washing into nearby Lake Ontario , did the government finally agree to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the waste will remain radioactive for 150,000 years . Forgive me if I panic when a crowd of pickups in front of an abandoned farmhouse , a stone 's throw up the road from the depot , is joined by a van labeled " Emergency Spill Response . " We 're not going to see any explanation of this in the paper . Tonight the Big Dipper hangs over the Seneca Army Depot , a scoopful of dark . Behind me the bright red of Mars ; demurely to the right , Venus . Suddenly the light of a small city is switched on in the emptiness , and I can see a transport plane slowly lowering itself like a huge , awkward moth onto the long runway . As soon as it touches down , the lights go out . Something 's been delivered . We 're in the dark again . I should try to sleep . But I 'm up for hours , unable to rest , groping for description , solace . I rummage the bookshelf , settle at last on Rilke , that poet for whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words to focus my unease : " Killing is a form of our wandering sorrow . " What danger has there been , I have to ask , in my own form of wandering ? What land would I defend ? Will I ever be " a local " ? Do I even want to be , with the term 's implication of provinciality ? Thought of another way , though , the local defines a circle of obligation , a territory of responsibility . The local versus the passing through  --  how you know which you are : A car pulls out right in front of you on a two-lane road . You have to slam on your brakes to avoid hitting it . It creeps along at twenty miles per hour , turns off a few hundred . yards down the road . You lean on the horn , let them have it . Next day , you only have to go a short way down the road to pick up a neighbor . You pull out of the driveway as you do every morning and meander down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bumper , honking . You let them have it . The boundary between these two indignation is thin . Ten miles down the road , we can easily lose our sense of territory , become the one hurrying elsewhere . Never having been settled long enough on a piece of land to see a tree grow from a dropped nut , to lie down before the bulldozers , I 'd have to ironically echo the Cree who , asked his address by a Canadian court , replied , " I have come from what I have survived on . " For me it has been friends , poems , certain paintings and melodies , horizon lines ... Home is a bed to lie down on , a desk to write at , a few talismanic objects hovering nearby . When I think back , images of my life line themselves up like photographs on the mantle , the landscapes of three decades a backdrop to self-portraiture , the land gone miniature , segmented into its inspirational moments .

Maybe we need different places for different phases of our lives .

Another ami ; trait is the sovereign contempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Penn Yan Democrat in 1835 . I 've begun more closely at this odd little town we 've landed in. do n't think of myself as a resident of Geneva , exactly settled my heart out on the lake and in the surrounding I valleys , but this is where I work and shop ; this is where , c I suppose , I 'm from now . In its heyday , Geneva apparently had genuine eiega a grand sense of itself . One can see the outlines of the still on the south side of town , where the college is , c coiffed South Main Street . There , atop a ridge over the lake , are storied row houses and mansions , gr broad , and a lovely semicircular park , the early , strolled heart of the town , gathered , secure . It has something of England village cohesion to it , not a classic green , bui genial gathering place unlike the slapdash market cen lies at the heart of so many American towns . Geneva , ; is made up of both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the swampy lakeshore below early on di into two essentially separate entities  --  the realm of co in the flats and " civility " above . Up on the ridge , arch  | pleasures abound , from Federalist symmetries to the gingerbread of High Victorian Gothic . The columns of the Greek Revival intersect the horizontals of lake and ridge in a whitewashed calm . Upstate New York , along with classical names , has the greatest concentration of classical architecture in the country , and Geneva boasts plenty of Greek Revival houses . They are beautifully set , too . In the backyards of South Main Street , winding paths descend steep gardened slopes to the lake , where pleasure boats wait . It all speaks of leisure , oldstyle aristocracy , an unlikely pocket of European elegance in this largely undeveloped landscape . But walk downhill  --  a quarter mile north  --  to the downtown area , and there 's a very different picture . Fun Food Grill , Club LTD ( Love to Dance ) , Bambu 's Place , Daniel 's Den ? there are more bars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but few shops of any substance . What were once wellproportioned , sturdy brick buildings , offices , and factories are now a crumbling , painted-over jumble of storefronts and apartments , sickly gray and beige , stuck together with neon and plastic . Where the old buildings have deteriorated beyond repair , they 've been replaced with shipped-in blank glass faces , so the streets have become a sorry mishmash . Nothing holds the eye , distinguishes one stretch from another . The scene is uncomposed , decomposing . People who 've lived here as long as twenty years still have trouble remembering whether a shop is on Seneca Street or Castle Street , each is so unremarkable  --  and this in a shopping district of only three streets . " For Rent " signs pepper the formerly prosperous Exchange Street , so named in honor of the volume of business once conducted behind its doors . Business , though , as in so many American towns , has been siphoned off by the highway and routed out to shopping plazas . A mile and a half of strip begins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plaza  --  a former frontier edge  --  and continues along so-called 5 &; 20 ,  | U.S. Route 20 here coinciding with New York Route 5 , both offspring of the Genesee Road , which by and large traces the Iroquois longhouse trail . Once the symbolic and literal aligning route of the League , the trail across which Iroquois runners ferried information the three hundred miles from Buffalo to Albany in just three days , the road now connects in a matter of hours the major cities and towns of upstate New York , flanked by car dealerships and junk-food outlets . Oddities are mostly what remain in business downtown : a restaurant supply store ( in a town that has perhaps the fewest restaurants of any its size  --  our misery ) ; a factory outlet party store , where plastic birthday favors sell ten for a dollar ; the Linden Exchange , where contorted mannequins pose in kellygreen and orange castoffs . Those who gather on Exchange Street these days do so in the doors of bars , thrift shops , and porno magazine stores . Often drunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shop and walk downtown . At night , under sulfurous streetlights , the drug dealers move in and fights spill out of the bars . It 's curious  --  we came to the periphery optimistic about a town that had been spared anonymous development . But instead the place feels overlooked , abandoned . Lack of development means thumbs down , decay . Though a dubious economy has saved Geneva from most of the chain stores , local entrepreneurs have n't stepped in in their place . It 's an isolated town of only fifteen thousand people with little to sustain itself . Despite the efforts of the college , much of the common culture as we 've known it elsewhere in America is missing  --  there 's little theater , live music , or food that has n't come off a production line . The town supports just one movie house and one small department store . Geneva has many of the griefs of a city  --  drugs , violence , the despair of the unemployed  --  but none of the advantages . Penn Yan , closer to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has even less to offer by way of  | entertainment . While it 's been novel and fun to spend Saturday nights with farmers at Penn Yan 's auction barn , listening to a local woman musically huckster everything from antique rockers and sleds to grab bags of buttons and lace , after a few months , we look around for Saturday-night alternatives , find ourselves driving the hour to Rochester or Ithaca for ethnic cuisine , a concert or foreign film . At first glance , the slight tawdriness of Geneva , its lack of pretension and avoidance of all things chic , had been reassuring . It had made me believe that another kind of culture must be thriving here , one I might feel at home in . But I now realize that behind the plainness there 's very little at all  --  mostly the remains of a swankier past and a sense of damage , a depression and frustration that hang over the place like sheeting . " Everyone in Geneva dead or dying or just walking around , " the painter Arthur Dove described it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bus station over coffee and cigarettes say the same thing : this town is dead , got ta get out , go somewhere else  --  to the bus station coffee counter of another town . I 'd hoped to find real distinction here . Instead , as in so many places in the world , one increasingly feels the denial of the " here . " The lovely , bay-windowed but falling-apart Seneca Hotel , still standing when we arrived in 1982 , was soon after razed and replaced with a featureless nine-story apartment block for senior citizens . They wander out blankly onto Exchange Street , no grocery store within walking distance  --  a completely misguided setting , and the building itself a major contribution to the downtown 's growing blandness . Geneva seems to think that buying into contemporary bland is the way to rate . It lobbies for junk-food chains ; its own restaurant menus never reflect the season or what 's grown here . A nearby eatery , perched above the lake , advertises New England lobster  --  of course nothing from the lake ( presented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be offered .   When a new mall is built in Syracuse right at the central hearth of the Iroquois League , I 'm startled to discover that it 's a virtual replica of the mall near my parents ' home in Florida ? same pink marble floors , same shops . Even the seafood house , which had struck me as fairly Floridian , is up here serving the same fish and biscuits . We 've been so conditioned by now to think of shops and restaurants as universal , impersonal , that it comes as a shock to drive up to the Dunkin ' Donuts here for my coffee one morning and find it darkened , a hand-lettered sign on the door : " Closed Due to Death in Family . " That a family stands behind the franchise counter is altogether unexpected . The twenty-fourhour services of our life seem unconnected to individual people . " Variety is disappearing from the human race ; the same ways of acting , thinking , and feeling are to be met with all over the world . " That was Tocqueville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predicament is news . Yet what is dismaying is the relentlessness of the commercial blenderizing of the world , the increasing rarity of any flavor of the local . The impulse behind it has frightening possibilities  --  Den Fujita , head of McDon-ald 's in Japan , in 1976 predicted of the Japanese : " If we eat hamburgers for a thousand years we will become blond . And when we become blond , we can conquer the world . " As places lose distinction , even the boundaries between them blur . Towns like Geneva do n't end in any definite way ; they dribble themselves out into farmland . Larger towns run into neighboring sprawl , so that a sign denoting a boundary seems arbitrary , pointless . Places are hemorrhaging . Some upstate towns still seem wholesome and livable in the way I 'd hoped Geneva would be . They retain the grace of their nineteenth-century architecture and fit in new buildings harmoniously . They have a comfortable neighborly feeling , storefronts where one can casually meet and loiter under the shade of old trees . Penn Yan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welcome you in from the country with an impressive run of Victorian houses and gentle downtown hubbub . But Geneva 's lost that feel . Economically , it never recovered from the agricultural collapse of the mid-nineteenth century . As well , the bypassing of the town by the builders of the Erie Canal shifted commerce slightly north . Up until then , Geneva 's fortuitous siting on the never-frozen Seneca Lake , where steamers plied year-round , had made it an important trade center . But by midcentury , with the growing dominance of the railroads , the lake was bereft of traffic . And when the New York Thruway chose the same bypassing route as the canal , Geneva 's marginality was sealed . The economy crumbled , and so did many of the old buildings and the town 's spirit . In recent times it 's perhaps the nearby army base which has most shaped the town 's ambi-ence  --  the number of bars , the sense of the temporary . Temporary too are the thousands of farm workers who migrate in from Florida each summer for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though in some respects there is still a strong sense of the local in the Finger Lakes region , and many extended families live within a few miles of one another , even setting up trailers for grown children at the edge of their plots , the love of one 's home place up here tends to have a defensive , narrow tone ; it easily becomes boosterism . There is n't enough in the life , it seems , to be proud of . The local paper gropes . " Days of Yore , " the daily salute to local history , publishes such rich facts as " Ten years ago today L.J . of Waterloo was the winner of a Lard Makes It Better ' pie baking contest at the Swine Field Day and Picnic in Pulteneyville .

Railroad cars assemble each morning on the siding by the lake  --  Erie Lackawanna , Susquehanna , Sioux City , Milwaukee , Amarillo  --  a mural of names elongating itself , churning up noise and gravel . Their painted place-names seem as real as the ground the cars shift over , the dream of distance . What freight is secreted inside we 'll never know . They 're just passing through . Also passing at a mere thirty miles per hour , a truck pulling a huge tank flanked by four state-police cars , lights flashing ? something dangerous , heading toward the depot . Materials for nuclear weapons are said to be shipped through the area routinely , by truck , train , and air . In town , shell-shocked veterans from halfway houses stand on street corners waiting for a bus to take them off to their excuse for a day . They smoke and wobble , big stubbled babies , their pants stained and sagging . At night they gather on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an extension cord , watching the traffic and the thrillers .

College students in catalog clothes zoom by in new Saabs calling for a clean environment and announcing " I Soweto . " Geneva 's a place where you can find a bit of anything , but all of it remains forlornly in bits . It 's the kind of town where when a boy is critically hurt in a car accident , a church telephone chain quickly spreads the news with requests for prayers . There are still farming families on the margins in coherent , small communities , here for generations , glimpsed at the hardware store . In town , trapped in low-paying jobs , women spend their money at tanning parlors . Their morals are old-fashioned , politics conservative , but they long for the gloss of the up-to-date ,  | the stamp of the middle class . Others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for little . They 're plagued with alcoholism and obesity and indifference . Day in , day out , lines of unemployed men fish from a crumbling cement pier that once held a row of swank boathouses , old hats pulled down over their eyes , the view blocked . Geneva is a goulash with too many flavors , too little meat . Its immigrant groups  --  Puerto Rican , Syrian , Italian  --  stand apart , unwilling to mix . The whole town holds off the college suspiciously . There 's no common vision of the place that could rally the effort necessary to revive it . Every few years Geneva tries to stir itself up , add a little this or that , a downtown revitalization plan , a row of antique street lamps . But it only gets sadder , thwarted by its contradictions . Well-intentioned renewal either fails to materialize or interferes with what 's genuinely attractive from the original stew . We academics are probably the greatest misfits of all . The vagaries of the job market being what they are , we often end up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , where , by inaction or inevitability , we stay for life . When a luminary from the big city arrives on campus in Geneva , many of my colleagues are quick to disavow this place . Their quips , their whole demeanor , say , " I may live here , but do n't assume I like it , that I 'm anything like them . " Any emissary of the cosmopolitan unnerves internal exiles , makes them feel provincial . Many who 've stayed here  --  even twenty years  --  are still in part pledged to escape . They know little about Geneva beyond their own small circle ; they need to maintain at least a mild disdain for it . Americans have a striking ability to ignore the place they 're in . It 's plainly visible in our homes , which regard the givens of local topography and climate as mere impediments to be overcome . Our houses rarely emerge from or hold to the  | land the way , for instance , Pueblo towns do . We blithely put picture windows in subarctic and tropical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Reproducing the ideal home everywhere may make moving across state lines less jarring , but it effectively shields us from the influence of geography , makes it easy to define our places by their interiors , to turn our back on where we physically are . English writer Stephen Potter has expressed amazement at Americans ' general ignorance of what watershed they 're in , which way rivers flow ? " which left me , as an Englishman who is uneasy unless he knows which ocean will receive his urination , somewhat scandalized . " Knowledge of watersheds seems esoteric given our fundamental indifference . Curiosity about and loyalty to an accidental place of residence is difficult , especially for people like us , who are , often , culturally and politically at odds with the communities that house us . We spend the day talking progressively , then hear our neighbors being narrow-minded and inflexible . We are threatening oddities to many of them , while in our eyes they often represent bigotry , puritanism , and selfishness . In the circumstances , it is tempting to isolate ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for many of us when asked to compare his life in suburban Princeton with the urban environment at Harvard from which he 'd just come : " In Princeton , I sit at my kitchen table at night doing physics instead of going down to Nassau Street . At Harvard , I sat at my kitchen table at night doing physics instead of going to Harvard Square . " From certain angles , Geneva is full of promise . Approaching from the east , there 's a skyscape of spires and stony blue-grays and the long cliff hovering over the lake spotted with clapboard , stone , and adobe houses . There is a lakeside park with a border  | of fat old willows , and there is the undeniably riveting blue of the lake itself with its big arena of sky . A town nestled up beside an open page of light . It should be beautiful . It 's not until you get up close that you see the empty nibbled lots , the unpainted backsides of warehouses and stores shoving themselves out toward the lakeshore , stagnant puddles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the grief of disuse , of attention turned elsewhere , the blight of so many American towns and cities . It 's the incoherence of the unintentional , the accidents of two hundred years of habitation , so much rushing through , so many western horizons to aim for , so little staying power . The whole town turns its back on the lake and surrounding landscape , aimed claustrophobically inward , viewless . There 's a slackness , a lack of belief . Even the church spires do n't proclaim " Here ! " They seem to say " Maybe . " ( Wrote Dove : " They are spending $2,000 putting up lights and Christmas trees which would support two families . They could n't cheer this goddamn town up with $50,000 worth of lights . " ) Through the I92os , Geneva was still fairly prosperous and a well-known resort . An express train came up directly from New York City , and the town actually had more than a hundred hotels , some with casinos . It was a place where the rich and artistic mingled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casino , but he must not have been too impressed  --  when he wrote Tender Is the Night , he had Dick Diver end up , in utter defeat , practicing medicine in Geneva and environs . By the time Arthur Dove came back for five years in the thirties , things had evidently faded considerably . Dove had grown up in Geneva and did his first revolutionary abstract paintings here after an eighteen-month visit to Europe , camping in the woods on the edge of town to recover from homesickness and to bind his love for the local landscape to his newfound ideas about painting . Those Geneva paintings made him the first American to develop a nonrepresen-  | tational style before the Armory Show , " the most radical American painter of the first decade of this century . " Some of his best paintings date from his return to Geneva as a mature painter , a return made to settle his parents ' estate . The estate 's unexpected debts , and the economic paralysis of the depression , turned the visit into a five-year ordeal of poverty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But Dove managed to paint brilliantly in spite of it , stimulated by his return to the loved land and lake . Georgia O'Keeffe came to visit , proclaiming Dove " the only American painter who is of the earth , " and Alfred Stieglitz was a steady correspondent ; their devotion kept him going . Most Genevans hated his work , considered it an ugly distortion of the local landscape . But O'Keeffe saw the density and exploding energy of his paintings as altogether representational of the region ? " He was up there painting , doing abstractions that looked just like that country , which could not have been done anywhere else . " Nevertheless , those years in Geneva were for Dove an intolerable exile from his chosen home in Long Island . He loved the landscape but found its inhabitants unbearable ? " It is swell from 3 a.m. until 6 ? then the people begin to appear . " He repeatedly damned the narrowness of Geneva society in his letters , clearly threatened by its puritanical strictures and its censure of his life ( he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman ) ? " Think I 'd better not try to like Geneva " ( a sentiment still audible on campus today ) . Geneva 's glitzier days can be resurrected only from books or in the late-night talk of longtime bartenders . It is now one of New York State 's most economically depressed towns . There remains but a handful of factories . The whole flattened-out northern end of town is crisscrossed by railroad tracks and disintegrating houses . A large tract of land designated as an industrial park lies nearly empty . What went so wrong here ? The town seems to have been unlucky almost from the start .  | After Sullivan 's successful campaign against the Iroquois , there began a period of intense land speculation . The site of Ganun-dasaga/Geneva was regarded as the gateway to Genesee Country , the great fertile territory running west from Seneca Lake to the Genesee River . The first attempt to appropriate the land was by the New York Genesee Land Company , which in 1787 tried to persuade the Iroquois to sign a 999-year lease , a lease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed the legal but financially precarious and indifferent speculators Oliver Phelps and Nathaniel Gorham , who bought two and a half million acres from the Iroquois for a pittance and opened the first commercial land office in America in 1789 . When Phelps and Gorham failed to profit quickly enough , however , they sold Genesee Country to Robert Morris , who quickly turned around and sold it to a group of English investors under the name of Pulteney Associates . The Pulteney Land Office , a cut-stone mansion , still stands just behind Main Street . Geneva was at that time only minimally settled : " a small , unhealthy village containing fifteen houses , all log excepting three , " according to visitor Elkanah Watson . Its sickliness was frequently noted , its inhabitants described as " a gang of lawless adventurers , who were prostrated by the fever and ague . The place was then notoriously unhealthy , from the proximity of an extensive marsh . " Watson looked forward to the day " when the borders of the lake will be stripped of nature 's livery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numerous flocks , herds , etc . . . . " Perhaps Watson was distressed by how different Geneva was from its European pastoral counterpart ; or perhaps it was the local accommodations , his group having been " troubled most of the night by gamblers and fleas , two curses to society . " Frequent illness was indeed a reality here . A dysentery epidemic in 1795 nearly wiped Ge-  | neva out . Early travelers refer repeatedly to the terrifying " Genesee fever . " Malaria and other illnesses became synonymous with the name Genesee Country . But the Pulteney Associates ' agent , Charles Williamson , overcame this inauspicious start . By 1804 , Geneva was a town of seventy houses , described as " handsomely situated " with " a large and elegant hotel , kept in the best manner , two schoolhouses , . . . several well supplied stores , three considerable distilleries , a brewery , and a market for butcher meat , of which 1,500 pounds is killed weekly . " Growth continued spectacularly , so that by 1818 , when Elkanah Watson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elegant but a salubrious village , and distinguished for the refinement and elevated character of its society . " It still at that point far exceeded future cities like Rochester and Syracuse as a trading center . Relentlessly enthusiastic , Williamson designed the town , got it built , and then promoted its qualities far and wide . The land of Genesee Country , he boasted , furnished " the best situations imaginable for farms . " Interestingly , memory of the land 's immediate past had already vanished ; Williamson expressed perplexity at the abundant evidence of former Seneca cultiva-tion ? " The openings , or large tracts of land , found frequently in this country free of timber , and showing great signs of having been once in a state of cultivation , are singularly curious . " Early settlers assumed that these tracts were bare because they were barren , wrote Williamson , but on attempting to cultivate them , " were agreeably disappointed on finding they had got a good crop , and in numberless instances they have continued to reap plentiful crops every year for seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account for these openings , or for the open flats on the Genesee River , where ten thousand acres may be found in one body , not even encumbered with a bush , but covered with grass of such height , that the largest bullocks at thirty feet from the path , will be completely hid from the view . " It was promotional  | letters like this , unknowingly boasting of the Seneca 's stewardship of the land , that persuaded many to emigrate to Geneva . Once Williamson 's ambitious plans for Main Street had taken shape , once a well-appointed inn was dispensing hospitality , and roads . were opened south to Baltimore , the town boomed . Williamson was criticized by other upstate developers for requiring little or no down payment from settlers  --  it was feared he 'd attract absentee speculators and undesirables . It 's true that there seems to have been great flux here for a time , land frequently changing hands . It was part of the general restlessness of the era , but partly due as well to Geneva 's location . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Genesee Turnpike , Geneva was a convenient first stop on the way to the developing western territories . Many arrived only to move on . In addition to regularly arriving boats , thousands of sleighs crammed the turnpike each winter . Emigrants generally preferred winter travel when the mud and marshes were frozen over . In other seasons , the roads  --  stumps often left in their midst , or " corduroyed " with logs hastily thrown down into marshes  --  were atrocious to travel . Tourist Charles Dickens reported on the horror , recommending that all visitors to the New World travel by boat whenever possible , specifically warning them against the notorious corduroy road ? " The very slightest of the jolts with which the ponderous carriage fell from log to log , was enough , it seemed , to have dislocated all the bones in the human body .... Despite the hardships , migration west was so intense along the Genesee Turnpike that journeyers heading east against the tide had a hard time getting by , and it was often difficult for travelers to find a night 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though , and many chose to stay in the rapidly expanding town . Immigrants from the South  --  Williamson 's prime target  --  mixed with New Englanders and contributed  | considerably to the town 's growing wealth and pretensions . Geneva 's so-called southern connection is unique in upstate New York . As early as 1802 , the large Rose and Nicholas families came with their entire plantations , slaves and all , to become gentry of the new North . Descendants of their slaves remain as part of the local African-American population , much of it impoverished and shoved up into the northeastern corner of the town , onto a wasted strip between Geneva and Waterloo called Border City . The story behind that name reveals something of Geneva 's plight  --  it 's the story of Preemption Road . At the Penn Yan end , fifteen miles south , they write it as two words and pronounce it " Pre Hemption . " In Geneva , at the intersection of 5 &; 20 , it 's marked by a sign erected by the State Education Department : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ December 16 , 1786 , Cause of Long Controversy in Western New York . " Massachusetts ? Halfway across New York State ? The first few times I glimpse the sign I am utterly baffled . I head back to the library . When the colonial charters were granted by the English kings in the seventeenth century , they were often written in such a way that the northern and southern boundaries of the territory were indicated , but no western boundary was delineated . Since there was no conception of the width of the North American continent , the charters often stipulated that the granted territory ran " from sea to sea . " Massachusetts was particularly adamant about its sea-tosea rights and went into a protracted battle with New York over title to the western part of the state . After years of negotiation , a compromise was arrived at whereby Massachusetts ceded sovereignty of the land to New York , but New York ceded to Massachusetts " the right of preemption of the soil from the native Indians " for the western portion of the state .  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Indians , resell it , and reap a fortune , but the land would then become New York 's . Early settlers in the area apparently found the ambiguity of the border as amusing as we do : " I arose early this morning and took a walk to Massachusetts and back before breakfast , " reads a local diary entry of the time , leaving descendants to doubt the writer 's sanity . Another : " Today I cut wood in Massachusetts . " The eastern boundary of Massachusetts ' portion was to run from eighty-two miles west of Pennsylvania 's northeastern corner , all the way north to Lake Ontario . A Colonel Maxwell began the necessary survey in 1788 to confirm the exact location of the line . It was assumed from the start by Massachusetts and the waiting hagglers that Geneva would certainly be part of the western territory . It was by far the largest settled town in the region and considered essential as a headquarters for land speculators . But Colonel Maxwell 's survey team emerged from their trek in 1789 one mile west @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thereby economically and politically stranding it . The survey was immediately and furiously attacked , especially by Phelps and Gorham , the team who 'd already bought rights to the territory from Massachusetts . " Not a line ; rather a succession of thrusts , " one writer described it . " Fraud , error or hard liquor ? " another asked . Fraud is a possibility ; one of the team was loyal to the New York Genesee Land Company , which still hoped to make a comeback by undoing Phelps and Gorham . And there were ample kegs of whiskey along for the ride . In any case , the line was a disaster for Geneva . It meant that Canandaigua , seventeen miles to the west , became regional headquarters for land dealers and businessmen , and eventually county seat . Geneva 's growth was from that moment limited , which was all the more frustrating when , a couple of years later , after Morris took over , the line was resurveyed and the error  | discovered  --  Geneva was in fact part of the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moreover , the correct line , running a mile east of Geneva , created an **25;0;TOOLONG triangle , called the Gore , that should have gone to Massachusetts , but did n't , and whose titles remained in complicated dispute for a century . The correct line , mirrored in the current Preemption Street , runs through Border City , a meaningless boundary in the midst of housing projects and railroad sidings . The name and circumstance of Preemption Road are so unusual that when a letter arrived from Denmark in 1967 addressed to a man on " Preemption Road , U.S.A. , " it was successfully delivered because a New York City postal employee recognized the name and sent it to Geneva . Most local residents , though , do n't even know the name 's origin . A man who 'd spent his whole life on the road is reported to have said , " I have always maintained that the correct name should be Prevention Road , but I 've never been able to find out what it was there to prevent . " It prevented no injustices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father ! " protested Seneca chief Cornplanter to George Washington in a 1791 speech in Philadelphia , " the voice of the Seneca nation speaks to you . . . . You told us . . . that the line drawn from Pennsylvania to Lake Ontario , would mark it our land forever on the East ; and the line running from Beaver Creek to Pennsylvania , would mark it on the West , and we see that it is not so . For first one , and then another , comes and takes it away .... High on a ridge over town , Preemption Road takes the brunt of the wind , gives the fullest of views . From up here , squint the plastic away and look back : Seneca Lake , Cayuga Lake , the ridge between  --  three giant steps east . Beyond , a long recession of illegible hills , white , blue , gray , black , or briefly orange under a  | contused sky . Vista blurs our tracks , lets us start over . From up here , I ca n't make out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the margins of fields ; there 's no strife , no poverty , hardly a building to interrupt the sweep of color , the canvas on which weather shows itself . Up here , heady on distance and the story of Preemption Road , I can ignore the traffic , the shopping center that marks this boundary now , ignore even the grand cobblestone house stranded on this hilltop , its stately Greek columns rising anomalously from the loud horizontals of mall and parking lot . Sometimes I come up here early in the morning , park the car on the one undeveloped corner of weeds , and look down over the lake and hills , catch the last dawn slick on the water , the ridges and drumlins taking their place in the light for the long march north . I felt from the start that the lake would be my center here , my point of orientation in an unknown landscape . I imagined myself afloat in the middle of it , the shore encircling me , my own body a kind of axis mundi . But except for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the rim of that circle , peering in , or , as here , high up , take in the large sweep of it . And this has left me feeling oddly unbalanced , not yet settled , even after two years . How easy it was on my Irish island to feel myself at a hub , the island a charmed circle afloat in the ocean , at the center of an arc of watery horizon and ringing mountain ranges . First thing in the morning , walking out the door , I knew exactly where I was , the island a separate fact in the middle of a huge all . It 's not as easy to locate myself again , to feel such certitude . There is too much crowding the edges , breaking into the middle . I 'm a mother now , and that has changed things considerably . For months last winter it meant I raced home after classes seeing nothing but my daughter 's infant face hovering in the windshield , beloved , absent . The landscape was static on the radio , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how I  | could contain it . Evenings I would walk Zoe into the yard , hold her out to the lake and sky  --  this her place of origin . I feel more profoundly part of the land now , having made her here . But those first months , my world contracted to her blue eyes . I drew the curtains , turned up the heat , and found my place in her gaze . By spring , my mind bolted . I began to look for a way back into the landscape , together with her . I learned where strollers could function , where I 'd have to haul her on my back . She , David , and I were going to have to belong to this place as a trio now , on new terms . We 'd have to embrace town life  --  its day-care centers and playgrounds  --  along with our lakeside woods . My choices could no longer come solely from my moody heart . To transfer my loyalty from sea to inland lake already demanded a reining in  --  giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepting limitation , a boundary on aspiration . Now , juggling work and motherhood and writing , the task of finding a way to bind myself to this land seems all the more daunting , but all the more necessary . The arena has necessarily shrunk , but thereby intensified . I rely on the lake as imaginative hearth . The horizon of middle age knows how much we can really take in at a time : a good four-mile stretch . Still , at the crest of Preemption Road , pausing for a moment between the morning with Zoe and my first class , distance contracts , hands me the land on a platter . I can dream again , return for a moment to the unsurveyed world , no possibility preempted . I can feel keenly the Iroquois ' love of this territory , the poignancy of their loss . I reassure myself that there are still plenty of things to discover here , to muse on , become attached to and grounded by . And I feel , as Peter Handke wisely describes it , " that moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing . " As always , it is a fragile moment . A semi guns past me . The unlovable specific intrudes.  | In this case , turning around to the west , it 's specifically the Pyramid Mall . In fact , the Pyramid Mall , with fewer than a dozen shops , is as flat and unaspiring as a leftover souffle and is more commonly referred to by its largest store : Kmart , here called the Kmart , so powerfully does it monopolize our material lives . " K for Kmart , " children chant as they learn their alphabet . " H for horsey , " the yellow plastic one spasmodically galloping by the front door . Across the road stands a Ponderosa Steak House on the site of what was once another great house up here , the Charles Bean Mansion , with its famous Lafayette Tree  --  a balsam poplar supposedly rested under by Lafayette as he approached the city of Geneva in 1825 during his **29;27;TOOLONG tour . Or , alternatively , the tree where the townsfolk shaded themselves , having walked a mile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ode for the occasion , sung by " a bevy of young ladies " ? " Columbia 's sons shall ne'er forget / the brave illustrious LaFayette . " ) However it happened that day , the tree grew legendary . It grew over a hundred feet tall , its trunk more than twenty feet around . And it survived until 1965 . It even made the National Hall of Fame for trees . In all likelihood , before its Lafayette association , it was a council tree for the Seneca . In pioneer days , a church met weekly in the chapel of its shade . And even if Lafayette himself did n't rest under that tree , he had to have passed it to get into Geneva , so the Lafayette Tree remains a favorite item of local sentiment , its photo proudly tacked up on the town-office wall . Charles Bean probably perpetuated the tree 's brush with fame to enhance the value of his land and the questionable Endymion Military Academy he tried to found there . Advertisements for the school show brawny young men resting around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brochure photo ) . Photos of Bean show him as pale and  | moon-eyed . He wrote numerous local histories with little basis in fact and erected a monument to Sarah Bernhardt . For his school , he built classrooms , a stage , dormitories , a gym , even put class mottoes up over doorways . But though he interviewed teachers , listed a board of governors , and had diplomas printed up , the school never really opened . Despite that minor detail , classes were " graduated " each year from 1884 to 1917 . Numbers of Genevans were listed as alumni . One admitted that while " trimming hedges and lawns at Endymion , he was instructed on occasion by Mr. Bean who read from a text book . " " Bean 's Folly , " the locals call it , one of the oddities that constitute Geneva . They distinguish themselves from outsiders by calling this intersection , with its larded air , Bean 's Hill . As hub , Bean 's Hill actually represents a shift of focus . The great Seneca village of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be easy , though , to live here a lifetime and never see sign of it nor hear tell of it . I 'd read there was a burial mound still visible at the site and was curious to see it . But on my first few quests I could find nothing . Follow Old Castle Street , I was told by a local ? " Castle " is what the early settlers had respectfully called the Seneca stronghold and the road that led to it . But following Castle Street out to the corner of Preemption Road just brings you to the Castle Street Mini Mart . It was n't until my third baffled attempt that I finally saw the telltale state historical marker in the convenience store parking lot , the sign tilted tenuously groundward , obviously having been hit by a car . So it 's another of those sites you risk your life for as the dirty blue and gold of information abruptly comes into focus and you slam on your brakes . A fallen sign marking the spot of the fallen empire . Hidden behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the low mound , a swell of earth bearing a modest plaque set by a club earlier this century . Gusts of passing traffic riffle its grasses . Across the street , where the  | tribe sowed corn , lie fields of the New York State Agricultural Experiment Station with red warning signs : EXPERIMENTAL ORCHARD-INEDIBLE FRUIT I labor to imagine Ganundasaga , its earlier orchards and cornfields stretching up to Bean 's Hill and past the Pyramid Mall , its regal longhouses and palisades crowning this plot . But nothing except the mound remains to mark the village  --  a squeezed-in remnant , a pile of dirt . Nothing in this cramped site can remotely suggest Ganundasaga 's size or power . The land the mound is on , I later discover , is not even under public protection  --  it 's owned by the Kalamazoo Furnace Company , outsiders . Fortunately they take their stewardship seriously . They keep the lawn mowed in summer , and when school-children come by to visit , maybe once a year , they kill weeds for the occasion . It is told : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who split a hickory for his bow and used pine trees for arrows . On a visit to the Hudson River , he saw a huge bird on the water , flapping its wings as if it wanted to get out . So he waded in and lifted the bird ashore . But then he saw that there were many terrified men riding atop the bird who gestured to him to return them to the water . When he did , they gave him a sword and a musket in thanks and the bird swam away . The giant returned to Ganundasaga and showed his tribe the sword and gun . When he fired the gun , though , he provoked terror and reproach . Calling him an enemy of the nation , the tribe ordered him to take the terrible thing away . Dejected , the giant left the council with his weapons and lay down in a field . The next morning he was found there , dead . A mound was raised over his body . It is said that if the mound is ever opened , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . The mound 's been in private hands since not long after the destruction of Ganundasaga by Sullivan . Verbal promises were made to the Seneca in 1795 , at the time of its sale as part of a  | farm , that the burial site would not be tampered with . And a small band visited yearly until about 1850 to pay their respects and ensure that the promise was kept . It more or less was until 1920 , when some ditchdigging in the area unearthed a large number of skeletons  --  none of giants . At once , a group of Seneca arrived from the reservation to rebury the dead and angrily demand that the old promise be kept . Local historian George Conover had earlier tried to ensure that violations of the grave would n't occur , even though he himself had been part of a group in 1879 that dug into the mound and removed a few relics and bones to " confirm the legend " that it was indeed a burial site . Contrite , however , Conover made a public appeal in 1888 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the site  --  the farms of the station virtually surround the mound , and the addition of the contiguous land seemed an obvious way to ensure the mound 's protection . Only three or four acres needed to be purchased . Seneca chief and U.S. general Ely S. Parker ( who was Lewis Henry Morgan 's informant about Iroquois culture ) seconded Conover 's appeal in an eloquent letter to then governor Hill : It matters very little to the people of this State , or to the undersigned , whether this be done or not , but to the historian and future generations , it is a matter of moment , to know what people lived here . . . . The amount required to initiate this matter is but a trifle , and to maintain it hereafter is a mere bagatelle for the great Empire State . . . . The Indians , as such , have left no memorial monuments . . . . The ancient Egyptians left to us their obelisks and pyramids , the Romans their buried cities , the Greeks their arts and literature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Americans have already planted a Washington Monument , and all that is  | asked here of this Legislature is the purchase , preservation and consecration of this small piece of ground , where shall remain , undisturbed from vandal hands , the dust of the Seneca dead . The appeal failed , and the historical record becomes sketchy at this point . It 's something of a small miracle that the mound has in fact survived dozens of private owners , including in recent times the Indian Mound Restaurant . Its preservation remains dependent on the kindness of strangers . The Indians have left no monuments ? When Cayuga chief Dr. Peter Wilson heard that declared to an 1847 meeting of the New York Historical Society , he angrily replied : " That land of Ganono-o or Empire State ' as you love to call it was once laced by our trails from Albany to Buffalo  --  trails that we had trod for centuries  --  trails worn so deep by the feet of the Iroquois that they became your own roads of travel as your possessions gradually eat into those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines of communication and bind one part of the Long House to another . The land of Ganono-o , the Empire State , then is our monument . " Another nearby site , Ganondagan , has recently become a more palpable monument . Geneva 's ancestor , Ganundasaga ? New Settlement Village  --  was founded only after the destruction of the larger Ganondagan about twenty miles to the west . Ganondagan was the Seneca 's principal settlement and reputed capital in the late seventeenth century , " a city or village of bark , situate sic at the top of a mountain of earth , " l'Abbe de Belmont described it in 1687 , its fatal year . " It appeared to us , from a distance , to be crowned with round towers . " Us , in this case , was the French , led by the Marquis de Denonville , governor of New France , who 'd marched down from Montreal to wipe out the nettlesome Seneca with the largest European army ever assembled in North America up to that time , more than  | three thousand men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands , containing up to 150 longhouses and a palisaded granary holding hundreds of thousands of bushels of corn . So great was the bounty at Ganondagan and three nearby villages that it took ten days for the French army to destroy their corn . Now , after a lapse of three hundred years , Ganondagan has just been dedicated as a state historical site . The August morning I drive out to it , the fields are striped with the gold of new corn and the dusky blue-green of cabbages . I 'm playing Breton folk music on my tape deck , intricate , buoyant circle dances , sea-spray dances , and it 's setting the mood . Birds seem to dip and dart to my sound track . Even the corn in the fields is nodding , concurring with the rhythm , wafting me out of suburban sprawl into a duet of land and song . Yesterday , when I called to get directions , a man on the phone slowly spelled out the complicated web of back roads between me and the site and finished by saying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flashing light , you 'll see me on the right . " For a confused moment , I imagined we 'd unwittingly made an appointment , and he 'd be there on the edge of Boughton Hill Road , waving me in . Then I recalled that it was just a handful of men and women , working for years , who had made the resurrection of Ganondagan a reality , and whomever I was talking to might well be tempted to use the first-person singular for the now-public park . Or perhaps this was evidence of the deepest sort of identification with a place  --  this old symbol of Seneca power , this reclaimed land : my tribe , me . When I pull into the parking lot , the site 's only visitor , there he is as he said he 'd be  --  Peter Jemison , already striding out to meet me , a commanding beacon : manager and sole resident of Ganondagan , answerer of its every phone call , greeter of every guest , guard of its mission . He leads me into the small visitor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the site . For decades before its protection , the area was plundered of  | beads , axes , and arrow points , but some beautifully carved bone combs have been preserved . While I watch a videotape of the village 's history , Jemison is outside pulling weeds from the flower beds , his clan amulet swaying against his broad chest ? earning the right to call himself Ganondagan . Around him swirl the wonderful hills and meadows the state has bought to enshrine this place , a memorial all the more poignant for the absence of much physical evidence of its inhabitants . Though they 'll allow no further excavation of graves , the Seneca firmly believe that Jikonhsaseh is buried here  --  the Peace Mother , or Mother of Nations , she who helped found the League of the Iroquois by convincing the recalcitrant and brutal Onondaga chief Tadodaho to join Hiawatha and Deganawida in their planned union . One interpretation of Ganondagan 's name , in fact , is She Lived There . Jikonhsaseh had been well known for looking after and feeding warriors along the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even that way . It was because she was the first to accept his message of peace , it 's said , that clan mothers hold ultimate power in the League 's political system . In her honor , this revived site is dedicated to peace . The site feels as plain as peace , as comforting . Mowed paths through the fields , dotted with informational markers , lead to nothing but the land itself , land just now embroidered with blue , white , and yellow wildflowers and the busy music of cicadas . At the crest of a hill , a sign marks the spot from which the French invaders were first sighted . It was , like today , an oppressively hot afternoon , and the women were working in the fields . I imagine them here , singing and hoeing , and suddenly noise , terror . . . It 's hard to envision violence on such minding-its-own-business land , hard to remember that men train for war beside the deep blue silence of Seneca Lake . A truck suddenly barrels up the road from Victor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It happens like that ; you can never prepare your-  | self . I turn back in to Ganondagan 's paths , along which herbs and berries were gathered , get lost in their odors , in the enclosure of trees . Here are the plants and grasses they brewed to soak corn seed in  --  protection for the crop from insects . Here are the fields of food , lore , and practical science , the cattails used for diapers and torches , basswood bark curved into water pipes , sumac poultices , cherry-bark cough syrup . Padding along the single-file path , I descend decades with each quarter mile , down gullies , down into windblown talking grasses , down finally into windless silence  --  theirs . At noon , three short blasts of the firehouse horn in Victor and , faintly beyond , the drone of traffic heading into and out of Rochester  --  ours . Nothing stands here . Postholes are all the archaeologists have found thus far , along with the small combs . The outline of one longhouse is marked by poles  --  the site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribe be commemorated by a battle-stripped field , by emptiness . The dozens of other longhouses and the twelve-foot-high palisades that once stood here must be raised by imagination . I willingly set them where Jemison points and follow his fingertip to the top of Fort Hill , from which today , he guesses , after checking the sky , I 'll be able to see Bare Hill down near the head of Canandaigua Lake . Bare Hill  --  the legendary birthplace of the Seneca Nation , another place that requires revival through imagination , and at the moment literal rescue . Bare Hill has long been a sacred spot for the Seneca , site of council meetings and ceremonies ; annual rites are reported to have taken place there through the 187os . The village of Ganundagwa nearby , now the city of Canandaigua , was named for its proximity to the sacred birthplace  --  Place Set Apart or The Chosen Spot . The popular version of the Seneca creation myth has it that the tribe broke out of the earth at Bare Hill  --  thus they are the Nundawaono @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from  | which they emerged was surrounded by a serpent , entrapping them . When they tried to escape , all were devoured except for two children who were told , by oracle , how to kill the monster . Shot with a poison arrow , the serpent writhed and tumbled down the hill , destroying the slope 's trees and vomiting up the heads of those it had eaten . The skulls of the dead are said to have petrified into the large round stones that lie on the bottom of Canandaigua Lake . The timber destroyed by the serpent never reappeared , so the hill remains " bare . " The details of the myth are debated ; the traditional version is a closely guarded secret , seldom told , especially to anthropologists . But the hill remains a crucial part of Seneca identity . " Our Senecaness is tied into the area , " says Peter Jemison . Bare Hill has recently been chosen for a subdivision of luxury homes . Long disused , it 's been littered with burned-out cars and soda bottles , torn up by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a place to walk and bird-watch , and out of a combination of ecological concern and respect for the Seneca , they are working to help block the housing project . There 's some confidence the battle will be won . The dedication of Ganondagan is seen as a breakthrough , just a start in the process of protecting and commemorating sacred Seneca land . People like Peter Jemison have returned to work here from lives that were cut off from their land  --  Jemison from a career as a painter and gallery manager in New York City  --  and they bring skill and zeal to their efforts . It 's especially touching to see Jemison in a leading role , but not entirely surprising . His quiet energy and determination match his Seneca lineage : he is a direct descendant of the legendary eighteenth-century captive Mary Jemison , the so-called White Woman of the Genesee . Mary Jemison not only willingly stayed with her captors but became an important , highly respected and trusted figure in Seneca life , even , for a time , holding wampum for the tribe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whites , she stands out as a salutary gesture , a healing link . Mary Jemison was born at sea in 1742 or 1743 as her parents emigrated from Belfast to Pennsylvania . In 1755 she was kidnapped , along with her family and several friends , by an Indian raiding party . Only she and a neighbor boy were spared ; the others were murdered , their bloody scalps displayed to the young Jemison the following morning . All that gave the girl fortitude was her mother 's final admonition , when she saw her daughter moccasined and separated from them , not to forget how to speak English . Brought to a village in Ohio in exchange for a murdered warrior , Jemison was adopted rather than killed , named Dehhewamis ( Pretty Girl ) , and lovingly cared for by her two new Seneca sisters . Though she did remember English all her life , forcing herself to practice it nightly , she quickly became fluent in Seneca and acclimated herself to tribal life . Her recollections of her first years with the Seneca are of a life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women worked together cheerfully in the fields and Jemison learned the skills that would later enable her to survive . After two or three years , she married a young man and bore a son , Thomas . She speaks warmly of her husband and their relationship , despite the obvious biases of the transcriber of her autobiogra-phy  --  her account was dictated in the last decade of her life to a writer who tempered her recollections to fit popular taste . Kidnappings , in this literary genre , were played up for their horror ; the embracing of " savage " life , and particularly miscegenation , was downplayed or denied . It was more than a little unsettling to American pioneers when white prisoners , like Jemison , chose to remain with their Indian captors . She never tried to escape , never seriously considered leaving when later offered the choice . She remained fiercely loyal to her adopted family , even after an ordeal that she describes as more  |p8o  harrowing than her kidnapping . Her young husband was from the Genesee Valley , and it was decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company of his two brothers ; he would follow and meet them in the spring . The group set out from Ohio on foot in early autumn , in thin clothing , the nine-monthold Thomas strapped to Jemison 's back . But it became unseasonably cold and there was a constant downpour ; nightly they slept on the bare ground in their sodden clothes . " Only those who have traveled on foot the distance of five or six hundred miles , through an almost pathless wilderness , can form any idea of the fatigue and sufferings that I endured on that journey , " Jemison dictated . Worse suffering followed when , the spring after her arrival , her husband did not show up . Months later she learned he had become ill and died shortly after her departure . In grief , and in a strange village , she had to begin her life once again . She had come to one of the most fertile and beautiful spots in New York State , the Genesee Valley ( about fifty miles west of here , its name in Seneca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her new life there that when a bounty was offered by the English to " redeem " her and other prisoners , she hid lest she be returned by force to now-foreign white society . The village consequently embraced her . She was married to a renowned warrior , Hiokatoo , by whom she eventually bore six more children . Jemison 's autobiography offers a rare firsthand account of the suffering caused by the Sullivan campaign from the Indian perspective . Her village hid in the woods while the soldiers destroyed their homes and corn , and returned to find " there was not a mouthful of any kind of sustenance left  --  not even enough to keep a child one day from perishing with hunger . " Jemison 's response was characteristically courageous . As the rest of the tribe fled into the unwilling arms of the English , she " immediately resolved to take my children and look out for myself ,  | without delay . With this intention , I took two of my little ones on my back , bade the other three follow , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she found two escaped slaves living in a small cabin who accepted her help harvesting their corn in exchange for food and shelter . I have laughed a thousand times to myself , when I have thought of the good old negro who hired me , who , fearing that I should get taken or injured by the Indians , stood by me constantly when I was husking , with a loaded gun in his hand , in order to keep off the enemy ; and thereby lost as much labor of his own as he received from me ... . At the Gardeau Flats , Jemison survived that uncommonly severe winter in which thousands died . The snow fell about five feet deep , and remained so for a long time ; and the weather was extremely cold , so much so , indeed , that almost all the game upon which the Indians depended for subsistence perished , and reduced them almost to a state of starvation through that and three or four succeeding years . When the snow melted in the spring , deer were found dead upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built herself a cabin , carrying the boards five miles on her back with only the help of her children . She stayed there alone on the Gardeau Flats  --  the slaves having fled to Canada  --  and grew corn to survive . When eventually some of her fellow villagers trickled back , they offered her the " freedom " to return to white society , though they insisted that her son Thomas , a promising warrior , stay with them . She was uninclined to go in any case . Pleased once again by her decision to stay with them , the tribe arranged in treaty negotiations that she be officially given the land on  | which she 'd built  --  the Gardeau Tract , nearly eighteen thousand extraordinarily fertile acres along the Genesee River . The Gardeau Tract is now part of Letchworth State Park , through which the Genesee River cascades over three waterfalls , cutting a canyon four hundred feet deep . It 's a spectacular landscape , often called the Grand Canyon of the East . I had only known the Genesee River farther north , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cutting a huge rock bowl around it , a gaping ravine between city blocks . Old mills and brick factories and the Genesee Brewery are edged up against the muddy , turbulent water  --  another world from the calm of Mary Jemison 's place , two centuries and a river journey apart . Though most visitors to Letchworth confine themselves to the waterfalls , one can hike down steep , muddy trails through head-high weeds to the bottom of the gorge and the lovely river where Mary Jemison farmed , fished , and raised her children . Down in the flats , the rush of rapids is only faintly audible behind the shush of wind in the weeds . The mud is soft , black , and fish tanged . Hawks circle slowly overhead , and the cries of crows echo off the rock walls . On summer evenings thunder cannons through the gorge , hammering it shut with a lid of sky . Come to pay obeisance to Jemison , I have led David and Zoe down here . They are innocent of information , have no associations or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  which is bountiful . Hot from the hike down , two-yearold Zoe tears off her clothes , wades into the river , squats , ritually pees . A butterfly lands on her shoulder , pauses , flies . She slowly squiggles her toes into the dark soft mud , is uncharacteristically silent . I put my hands in the river , finger stones . This is the place  --  where Jemison cleared the land , sowed corn , built her cabin . It 's overgrown , unmarked . Fish pass , birds pass , and wind passes over the trees . I momentarily shiver in the trapped isolation of the gorge , its high walls blocking out everything but a slice of sky . Maybe  | it takes a physical severance from the surrounding world  --  by water or walls of stone like these  --  to feel an unquestioning sense of place . I imagine living in this deep valley , imagine it in January filled with snow , wind turned to harrowing blast , the withered grasses , the land holding its breath for six months . Here at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look like something passing by , only incidentally depositing itself on your head . For Jemison this tract was a literal gift , a place set apart . For me , it is a reminder of how I felt on the island  --  placed  --  but also an invitation , a foretaste of what this whole region might slowly come to mean to me . I watch Zoe trying to fish with a reed , the wind playing on her brown curls . What greater life could Jemison have given her children than this river and rock-edged bowl of sky ? Offered freedom  --  from this ? Of course she stayed , stayed till she was in her eighties ; stayed , I guess , till she could no longer manage the trail out of the canyon . We stay too , as long as we can , wandering , wading . I 've been too long away from this sensation to want to move on . When we must , we struggle up the steep trail and at the top , panting , gaze back down wistfully into the wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few miles up the road to visit the cabin Jemison built in the flats for one of her daughters , the building now transplanted to a more convenient site for tourists , and beside it , a memorial sculpture of Jemison herself , baby Thomas strapped to her back , looking as she did when she first arrived in Genesee Country . Strong , handsome . But in truth she is more easily envisioned back there in the curve of the river and the windblown reeds : a woman who found her place . I would like to say she was left in peace finally , but she was not . Thomas was murdered by his competitive half brother John , her eldest son by Hiokatoo . The following year , John killed his youngest brother ; he himself was murdered five years later . Only three of Jemison 's seven children survived her .  | While Jemison 's life was extraordinary , so too was the book that recounted it . It was the " unrivaled best-seller of 1824 , " and for the rest of the decade " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Cooper . " Her story , according to Annette Kolodny , is " the first text in American literature to move a real-world white woman beyond the traditional captivity pattern to something approaching willing wilderness accommodations .... " Jemison remains a brave example . Willing accommodation is a good description of what I 've been trying to do here , cast by circumstance into this resonant land . My friend Marvin , a historian who 's been teaching in Geneva for twenty years , calls this area " the most insulted place I know " ? its environment abused and its history so compulsively ignored by most inhabitants that recent Iroquois land claims appear as if out of nowhere , colliding with communal amnesia . The abyss between us and the past of the land seems impossible to bridge sometimes . Blithely , we ignore what our culture sits atop . Our indifference defines policy , determines what will literally survive . Bare Hill , or any number of unknown sites , loaded with significance , become , through ignorance , easily dispensable . The real estate of memory is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hand in hand here : an " I love New York " tourist ad on the radio , a hygienic-voiced male urging Americans to visit " the same lakes and waterways that the Seneca Indians were attracted to hundreds of years ago " ? as if it were a matter of attraction . And as I listen , dumbfounded , a truck goes by on the railroad tracks , two men directing gigantic sprayers on each side , spilling defoliant out at the trees and underbrush that have encroached on the tracks , spraying it out past the tracks onto the road , and out , in a blast , onto the hood of my car . To be in a place that was dwelled in so felicitously , with troves of associations , and to see it mistreated pains me . A weak  | sense of the past encourages a weak sense of place . When people are attached to their forebears , they want to remain close to where they lived , continue their traditions , tend their graves , embody their hopes . Many may remain where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the staying itself is conducive to life because the lived-in land then becomes an extension of the self , the family and group ; to endanger the land is to wound one 's collective body . Lacking that connection , as most of us do now , how do we come to feel loyal to a place ? What makes it feel like a place at all ? I 've been hunting down stories so that the land rings for me . I 've been looking for the play between land and people , for coherence , a sense of conscious choices in design , evidence of the past left visible in the present . I want a place where work , pleasure , and the spiritual can casually coexist , a place where children feel themselves in community . I want to be in a place where people feel they genuinely belong , where the life lived and its location coincide with a kind of inevitability and fruitfulness , where life is not being lived , as Lawrence Durrell puts it , at " right angles to the land . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps that 's the sense of place of a vanishing era , no longer to be found . I wo n't find it easily here , especially in the town of Geneva itself . I 've given up my illusions about that . But something about this land , this fifty-mile radius of central New York , comfortably encompassing the contemporary worldliness of Ithaca along with Ganondagan , Letchworth , and the still-burning hearth of the Iroquois , continues to tempt me with hope . On our happiest days , out walking , Zoe announcing each small event we pass ? " Squirrel eating a nut ! " ? and layers of other voices in my head joining the shuffle of leaves and finches , I glimpse what a grounded life here could be . As with Jemison , the freedom to go elsewhere is becoming a moot point . I 've found festering wounds beneath fine scenery here , an  | angular discomfort . But I 've found as well a palimpsest of lives by which I might patch together an understanding , a kind of poultice for my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I can perhaps attach myself to them . It will take an act of deliberate adoption , a willed transplant . Having a sense of place may by now require a continual act of imagination .  | THE WORD " DWELL " has a complicated past . We think of it as implying permanence , continuity in a place . But at root it means to pause , to linger or delay . We dwell on a subject , but eventually give it up . How long do we have to stay somewhere to say we dwell there ? J. B. Jackson takes on the question , but does n't try to answer in months or years . Instead , he speaks of habits , of a place becoming customary . Habits are acquired , they form over time . With disuse they are forgotten . To dwell in a place rather than simply exist in it seems to hinge on allowing adaptive habits to form , the act of accommodation . It used to be easier . A home and its land were once widely understood as belonging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world are born and die within a radius of a few miles . Our much-talked-about casual mobility in this country is an exception . Twenty to thirty percent of Americans move each year ; the average American moves fourteen times over a lifetime . Permanent residence is at odds with our notion of property ? property as commodity , as route to profit , rather than something attained to keep . The American dream requires that you own your home , but Americans rarely stay in a house longer than five years . Remaining in a home and passing it on to your children is a " certifiable " oddity  --  in Michigan , houses occupied by the same family for one hundred years or more carry a plaque designating them " Centennial Homes . " American mobility rates have remained fairly constant over the past hundred years , but the distance of the moves has increased considerably . To change not just your town , but the  | region of the country you live in , is understood as a way to change your life , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , marriage , birth of children , a new job , divorce , retirement  --  almost require a change of location . In fact , to stay in one place for life is usually interpreted as being unambitious , unadventurous  --  a negation of American values . Big cities like New York are perhaps the greatest exception to this rule ; there is so much potential mobility within them , and cities can be so addictively stimulating , that many would refuse to move elsewhere no matter what the opportunity . But for most of the rest of the country , moving up in the world means moving on , and often that means moving from the rural to the urban and ultimately the suburban . To stay while others move on may be to feel left out , condemned : " Many people prefer moving to staying around and saying good-by to everyone else , " reports the wife of an oft-transferred businessman . The easy replacement of home ignores its emotional charge for us , ignores how important familiarity is in the constitution of home . The need for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be essential to cognitive development and psychic health . However often and successfully we manage it , moving is wrenching , especially to children . Psychiatrist Harold Searles has found that among his schizophrenic patients , a large percentage had experienced numerous changes of residence during childhood . " I have repeatedly seen these patients struggling to remember where they lived , at what age , struggling in a way which indicated that it was very important for their own sense of personal identity , of personal integration , to be able to establish such a continuity of experience in their memory . " Among schizophrenics this struggle may be pronounced , but it is a groping for order , for a clear organization of experience , that 's familiar to many of us . Frequent dislocation , or the sudden destruction of a known  | environment , can be fundamentally deranging . It means the loss of personal landmarks  --  which embody the past  --  and the disintegration of a communal pattern of identity . Home is where we know and are known  --  through accumulated experience . People relocated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more " attractive " the new housing provided . The interconnection between the physical facts of a place and the life lived there is indissoluble . Eliminated townscapes may remain powerfully alive in peo-ple 's memories , as vividly illustrated in Vasco Pratolini 's novel Il Quartiere , where Florentines walking a razed section of their city continue to follow the paths of its former streets rather than cutting diagonally across the space where buildings once stood . It 's easy to understand their tribute , feel the tingling impossibility of walking into newly cleared air  --  a sense of taboo for those who want to believe in the solid dependability of the physical world . When an entire place or landscape is destroyed , the sense of betrayal and disorientation is acute . Harvey Cox recounts the shattering story of a Holocaust survivor from the Czech village of Lidice , which shows such loss in the extreme : The Germans had arbitrarily picked this hamlet to be the example of what would happen to other villages . ... They came into the town , shot all the men over twelve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children to another . They burned the village completely , destroyed all the trees and foliage and plowed up the ground . Significantly they demanded that on all maps of Czechoslovakia the town of Lidice must be erased . The woman survivor confessed to me that despite the loss of her husband and the extended separation from her children , the most  | shocking blow of all was to return to the crest of the hill overlooking Lidice at the end of the war  --  and to find nothing there , not even ruins . English poet John Clare felt similarly violated by the Enclosure Act , which , in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries , vigorously transformed the common open-field system of rural England into private holdings in the name of efficiency . Instead of the long strips and winding trails of the old communal arrangement , small square fields and straight , connecting roads were rapidly imposed on the land , virtually erasing its prior boundaries and landmarks . Even streams were diverted to fit the plan . The landscape was reconfigured on a blank map @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Inevitably , such a rapid transformation of landscape had profound personal and social consequences . Previously , a parish had been circular in conception , its village at the center of a ring of three or four large , shared fields around which crops and cattle were rotated . That was Landschaft , from which the word " landscape " derives , and it meant more than just a way to organize space . It stood for an ideal of habitation , of people 's obligations to one another and the land . A community had to cooperate and follow traditional customs in order to survive ? in the common-field system , for example , harvesting of crops had to occur at the same time so that everyone 's cattle could then safely be let in to graze the stubble . The entire field , of course , had to be sown with the same crop , at the same time ; there was no place for personal idiosyncrasy or procrastination in such a world . Observes John Barrell , " This obligatory submission to the ancient and customary was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned in upon themselves  --  so mysterious to the improver , and so closed to the traveller ; and the effect of enclosure was of course to destroy the sense of place which the old topography expressed , as it destroyed that topog-  | raphy itself . " After enclosure , the communal sense of place and identity was divided into numerous fenced and hedged private loyalties ; a parish became little more than an intersection of roads on the way to the next parish . John Clare and others like him who had rarely been outside their own parishes were caught in a moment of violent physical and social transformation . Removed from Helpston where his family had farmed for generations , Clare suffered catastrophically from the loss of familiars and the location of his memories ; he left an eloquent record of his pain . Ive left mine own old home of homes Green fields and every pleasant place The summer like a stranger comes I pause and hardly know her face The disorientation of removal for Clare was such that even the dependable sun " seems to lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Outside Helpston " the very wild flowers seemed to forget me " ? as if it had been the known landscape that confirmed his existence . Unable to write about his love of nature in general terms , Clare lost , with his displacement , the crucial particulars that gave his voice a body . Over the following few years , his connection to the external world increasingly slipped . He spent the last twenty-seven years of his life in an asylum writing such lines as " I am  --  yet what I am , none cares or knows . " When Clare 's publisher visited Helpston , he was perplexed by Clare 's devotion to it , his mourning of its alteration  --  it looked so boring a place to a Londoner . It comes as a shock , too , to read that the strange land Clare was exiled to was but three miles from home . All over Europe , from the Renaissance on , the landscape was increasingly divided as in England , places visibly defined in small units . A side effect was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land , regarding the landscape as a work of art . Landschaft had become landschap in the hands of Dutch and Italian painters . Landscape painting reflected the growing visual preference for a landscape composed of balanced parts , while at the same time it helped to disseminate that as an ideal . Some claim people only learned to see landscapes by learning to appreciate landscape painting . At its most extreme , says Samuel Monk , " Nature was scarcely seen at all , for the lover of the picturesque was bent upon discovering not the world as it is , but the world as it might have been had the Creator been an Italian artist of the seventeenth century . " Our view is still controlled to some extent by that aesthetic norm  --  highway planners provide us with scenic overlooks that command us to admire the land from a carefully contrived viewpoint . Though enclosure was largely economic and agricultural in motive , it of course had aesthetic implications , too . And it made social distinctions more visible  --  between rich and poor , between places for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great English gardens were created  --  by , as Raymond Williams puts it , " a self-conscious observer who was very specifically the self-conscious owner " of a pleasing stretch of land . It was in this landscape that private property provided both topographical and social place rather than one 's place being communally defined . The notion of place in which one owns and cares for a plot of land still exerts enormous influence on contemporary Americans . The extent and condition of our property , and our choice of style in dwelling , create a powerful emblem of our identity and status . At the same time , though , we are awash in a landscape of mobility that eschews connections to particular plots , has no need or desire for great distinction between places , and is essentially utilitarian about the land , often lacking environmental  | conscience . Place has come more to mean proximity to highways , shopping , and year-round recreation , rather than natural situation or indigenous character . In some ways , that 's been liberating . In the hierarchy of landowners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the landscape of mobility , new communities  --  be they townhouse tracts or trailer parks  --  can crop up on the spot and rapidly assimilate new members . Yet we remain caught between nostalgia for place in its traditional sense and cool detachment , between a sense of responsibility for the land and the freedom of indifference . We 've been told we live in a global village , which sounds a little like a Landschaft , but in truth , the technologically shrunken world has left us without much of a foothold . " Homelessness , " warned Heidegger , " is becoming a world fate . " And now we watch it literally and figuratively all around us . Numerous modern writers have applauded the condition of " perpetual exile " as ethically healthy , a necessary severance from the sentimentalities of nationalism , for example . Others , though , prominently Simone Weil , have argued for attachment : " To be rooted is perhaps the most important and least recognized need of the human soul . . . . A human being has roots by virtue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the life of a community , which preserves in living shape certain particular treasures of the past and certain particular expectations for the future . " Given how often I 've moved , my community is widely scattered . I have close friends all over the world ; none of them knows each other . We have only our own brief intensities of common experience to bind us , our telephone calls and letters . Friendship is tethered to loss , dependent on mental reconstruction instead of daily enactment . Despite my growing number of friends here , I sometimes feel stranded at the center of a fragmented orb , my life divided into a series of experiences and places that can never be brought together  --  except in the soli-  | tude of memory . My family too is deposited all over the continent . Crucial junctures in our lives take place in hospital hallways or over bad coffee in airports . In many ways our upbringings prepare us for this essential solitude . The obsessive privacy of the typical American home molds us in an image of separateness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world has isolation been such a common pattern of settlement as in America , especially historically in rural America . As settlers moved out onto the rectangular grids the country was carved into , their farmhouses were almost invariably set toward the middle of the plot , very rarely clustered at the corners near adjoining blocks of land so as to provide proximity to other families . In Quebec , by contrast , farm plots were made long and narrow so that houses could be set side by side along a road . Congress , debating the Land Ordinance Act , briefly worried about the lack of any central focus in the grids . Congressmen from New England believed the lack of a central meetinghouse would lead the settlers into sin . No gathering of towns or villages was conceived of in the grand design ; each family went it alone out on the grid . The itinerant merchant materialized , and the mobile library ; social life atrophied . These settlers were people who 'd primarily come from urban centers in Europe . Their survival in such extreme solitude became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the core of American identity . I 'm admittedly the observer and writer I am in part because of the freedom to wander I 've had . I did spend five years experiencing what it meant to stay put in a small place with a vital , rooted culture , but mobility is what got me to Ireland and back and what then led me through the experience of several American cities . Mobility is , for many of us , essential to personal and economic development . " Mobility is always the weapon of the underdog , " says Harvey Cox . Yi-Fu Tuan , too , reminds us that rootlessness goes hand in hand with American  | ideals we tend to admire  --  social mobility and optimism about the future : " To be tied to place is also to be bound to one 's station in life , with little hope of betterment . Space symbolizes hope ; place , achievement and stability . " A fixed place can obviously be seen as a trap , home to drudgery and hopelessness . " Roots are ruts , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the property of vegetables , " scoffs geographer David Sopher . To Sopher 's mind , the prevailing " domicentric " bias in our thinking has turned " rootless " into the stigmatizing image of the shifty vagabond and made all wandering peoples suspi-cious gypsies , tinkers , the Wandering Jew . When people are seen as lacking loyalty to a place , lacking perhaps even the ability to be loyal to places , it is easy to persecute them , see them as threatening to communal stability . The privileged and unadventurous may rightly fear that mobility threatens established traditions , and so they exaggerate the healthy attachment to place into rigid exclusivity and sentimentality . For the underprivileged or disaffected , though , mobility may represent a lifesaving escape , the eluding of oppressive inherited values and the stranglehold of tradition . For a phase of one 's life , at the very least , it is a great relief to be free of the influences and expectations that a home place holds , just as one often needs to escape the clutches of one 's family in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Stieglitz responded to Dove 's plaint of being inundated by them in Geneva , " everything is relative except one 's relatives &; they are absolute . " ) Place requires " encounters and obligations , " summarizes James Houston ; it means accepting certain limitations . Space , on the other hand , is " the arena of freedom that has no accountability . " As a national ideal carried to an extreme , mobility has unfortunately created the circumstances for widespread fragmentation and damage  --  to people , communities , and the land . The deliberate avoidance of ties to a place , which take years to build , removes constraints , allows us to be indifferent to our  | towns and cities , to ignore their human and environmental plights , to say but this is n't mine . To cling to the right of mobility with all the freedoms it bestows is ultimately to contribute to destruction . In other traditions , a balance between wandering and staying is aspired to , the understanding that a full life involves both venturing out and returning . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditionally metered poem between the security of a repeated pattern and the surprise of variation . ) In the allegorical world of mythical and religious journeys , the greatest challenge of the journey is to return home , to share the lessons of one 's experience , to incorporate the journey into its place of origin and help others toward one 's insight . Or , as T. S. Eliot has it : We shall not cease from exploration And the end of all our exploring Will be to arrive where we started And know the place for the first time . In Buddhist tradition , the cherished figure of the bodhisattva is the enlightened one who chooses to return home after his spiritual journey , to delay entering nirvana in order to share his insights with others . While remaining in a single place can indeed be imprisoning , to wander compulsively makes one a noncitizen . There is a delicate dialectic to play out . " Before any choice , " says French geographer Eric Dardel , " there is this place which we have not chosen , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establishes itself . We can change places , move , but this is still to look for a place , for this we need as a base to set down Being and to realise our possibili-ties  --  a here from which the world discloses itself , a there to which we can go . " Or as poet Richard Hugo puts it , " If you are in Chicago you can go to Rome . If you ai n't no place you ca n't go nowhere . " When we lack a here , our wanderings are full of longing and  | confusion . With no abiding sense of home to get back to , all my travels have had a certain restlessness in them , a neediness . Rather than simply browsing the postmodern menu of the world , like many of my generation , I keep trying to fall in love , find " it , " the ultimate place I can imagine spending my life in . Writers travel in idiosyncratic ways , and the record of their journeys can tell us much . For Alastair Reid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from " a firm " here , " his native Scotland , a desire for the keenness of being perpetually foreign . Lawrence Durrell , on the other hand , preferred to be called a " residence-writer , " not a travel writer , his books delving into , testing the perfection of the places he alighted in , wholeheartedly taking on their coloration . " Why should we take such an odd pleasure in being taken for a different nationality from our own ? " asks Reid . " Perhaps because we have succeeded in getting away with an impersonation . . . . " Or perhaps , as Durrell might have it , we have succeeded in pasting on a truer identity than the one we were circumstantially given or molded into , have found the truer stage for ourselves , the truer home of our imaginations . Given the thin gruel of my series of childhood homes , my own searchings have been driven by Durrell 's kind of longing . Out on the edge of Geneva , large rolled carpets of hay , like big jelly-roll mounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straw sculptures . They are so weirdly evocative in the August sun that I stop to study them , consider them , find their place in my memory . And strangely enough the echo they strike is of Carnac in Brittany  --  that field of granite monuments , eleven long avenues of more than three thousand standing stones , huge to tombstone-sized , unexplained , of an age with Stonehenge . Years ago , I wandered to Carnac in the midst of a vague  | pilgrimage . I 'd decided to go to the Breton coast to visit the setting of Eleanor Clark 's moving book The Oysters of Locmariaquer , a work she describes as " a journey of interrogation " into the famous French oyster and the people who raise it . Mine was a journey of writerly admiration and appetite . I checked into an inn , ritualistically ate a plateful of the storied oysters with good white wine , then set out walking near dusk toward the edge of town where a sign announced " Dolmen . " There I found a field of rolling mounds and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridge of boulders , not as stark and tall as those burial sculptures I 'd known in Ireland , doorways in open air , but wonderfully cavelike , still partly covered with earth , its huge slabs of rock set upright into the earth and roofed with a plate of stone thousands of years ago . The quiet of a distant intention hung over the enclosed , designated space . Someone 's bones housed here . Twilight gathered , I stood beneath the cross stone , extending myself . . . and then I heard a chirping , a piping , a song or calling . . . I heard . . . something , and it was rising out of the ground just beyond the field . Trembly , I headed in its direction . Flutelike first , the music grew , added a drum , maybe a lute . It wandered as I followed , hopping tree to tree , distancing itself from my approach . It was almost dark . I despaired of finding the melody , its source and reason . Then I saw fire between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The music seemed to be coming from the flames , the sky above orange and alive . What in the world had I stumbled on ? I pushed forward , and abruptly I was out of the trees and into a clearing , standing before a huge bonfire being danced around by hundreds of costumed women , men , and children . A fivewoman electric band was playing old Breton folk tunes on a hilltop beside them , and glasses of brandy were lined up on a table for the taking . A bacchanalia , a fest , and suddenly I remembered that it was the eve of the summer solstice , remembered years of bonfires on mountaintops in Ireland , the drinking  | and singing  --  a pagan rite kept alive by Celts . I hung at the edge  --  this was theirs , not for outsiders or tourists  --  but the old women soon beckoned me toward the brandy , and enlivened by it I let my feet follow the ancient folk dances ringing the fire , let myself be warmed and spun . The trees swayed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ritual had persisted , I loved how it had been adapted : that was no lute I 'd heard , but a synthesizer , and Orpheus was a woman , blond hair flung over a shoulder , lipsticked , smiling . I floated back to the inn . Next morning I drove to Carnac , parked away from the beach and creperies , and faced the astonishing forest of stones  --  gnarled weather-beaten steles , unpolished , untamed . Stonehenge hundreds of times over . Nearby were the tallest , high as thirteen feet , and some of the carved ones , indecipherable . Farther on the stones get smaller , plainer , are gorse choked and lichen painted . I stared down the lines , groping for a logic to their arrangement . All I could feel was the force of their existence . That they were probably erected more than six thousand years ago was enough to keep me staring . The vastness of the project stunned too  --  the incalculable labor required to cut , move , carve , and arrange three thousand large stones . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's stones are imagined to be navigational beacons , patterned runway guides , or even energy-storage cylinders that a plane could beam in on . " Theories have proliferated in abundance over the centuries and range from suggestions that the stones are immense plugholes that prevent vast underground springs from bubbling up and inundating the land , to the perennial , and universal , folktale that the upright pillars are the bodies of soldiers turned to stone through magical powers by someone they were pursuing . Concurrent with the latter belief is the familiar legend that at certain times the stones return to life and hold dances , go to the nearby spring for water , etc . " Evidence of the astronomical knowledge behind the stones '  | arrangement is strong  --  each group seems to have a specific solar orientation . Lengthy research by Alexander Thom suggests that Carnac was a kind of laboratory for testing and refining observations of sun , moon , and stars . There are as well numerous fertility and agricultural symbols engraved on some of the stones  --  plows , wheat , ox horns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the design and symbols , Carnac is a cemetery too , and one people may have brought bodies to from many places , the remains of several races having been unearthed there . The big strung-out field held a taut silence . I walked the rows in and out , up and down , their mystery drawing me as compellingly as last night 's wild music had . I wove them ; I touched them ; I held out my wings and found a landing strip . I was already late to meet friends back in Locmariaquer . And then the solstice festival of the night before reerupted  --  a dozen couples , clownishly dressed , suddenly appeared and began to play a carnival game among the stones , the men stuffed into baby carriages , the women , hobbled , racing them along a balloon-festooned obstacle course , cheered by onlookers , accompanied by a band of pipes and drums . What could this mean ? Some invisible finish line was reached , the cheers rose , and the players collapsed in hilarity , their ritual fulfilled . The sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the old silence and granite gray . Carnac was suddenly aflame , the band taking off down the main avenue , piping the air into dance , clowns shimmering in ruddy clusters , still laughing , the music and light and unspoken meaning of the place gathering into one of the rarest celebrations of place I 've been fortunate enough to witness . Inexplicable Carnac has been called " the skeleton of a dead place , " whose meaning has withered . But these raucous carnivalists would n't agree  --  even though they were now climbing back into their Ford Escorts , trailing ribbons and prizes , to head for a drink in town . They had come , they had played , they had paid some kind of obeisance .  | ? Around 188o , not far from Carnac , people who had been married for several years and not had children , came , when the moon was full , to a menhir ; they removed their clothes and the woman began to run around the stone , trying to escape from her husband 's pursuit ; their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come and sit on the cromlech of Cruez-Moquem with their dresses tucked up ; a cross was set upon the stone precisely in order to put an end to this practice ... . ? Kings and clerics in the Middle Ages were constantly forbidding the cult of stones , and in particular the practice of seminal emission in front of stones . They still visit , in broad daylight . I am back in a Geneva hay field , not dancing or being chased , feeling a little self-indulgent . There 's no mystery-laden pattern here , just stacks of grain randomly thrown out by a machine . Still , it has kept me looking , remembering . It has , true enough , transported me somewhere else by association , but now this place holds that place , like an envelope , and my feelings for the two are intertwined . We do bring our experiences home , finally . I thought I saw Carnac again , once , on the road between Geneva and Waterloo . It was astonishing , but there under the full moon I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field , row after row , calm and empty . I kept blinking my eyes , unnerved . Then I saw the sign : the " Seneca Drive-In Theater , " defunct , the poles of its sound system left erect in the gravelly , weed-choked graveyard of drive-in movie days , left to glint in the moonlight , an electronic alignment , musicless.  | Once a Carnac is glimpsed , there 's the understandable desire to return or to find it elsewhere , to experience again the shock of a whole , richly layered place . It drives me still to travel . I still half think I 'm going to find the place for me , for us . I come from a people in diaspora who only lightly touch the place on earth they happen to be living . My grandparents fled the pogroms of Russia and Eastern Europe , lost the coherence of their villages , reestablished it , to some extent , in the immigrant streets of New York . Then their children , my parents , fled the city for an American-dream suburban life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the many homes my parents made for me and my sister approached what they had come from  --  their goal was to get as far from that life , with its poverty and ghetto narrowness , as possible . Suburbia may have offered a new form of community to them , but it was more truthfully a series of stepping-stones to status . The streets outside our increasingly pricey homes , though , looked exactly the same to me  --  mass-produced and bare , something for us to buy into , move on from . Housing developments still grieve me . Not only are they interchangeable and ubiquitous , but they are also such an ominously forced form of neighborhood  --  house colors legislated to a single shade , or choice of similar three , landscaping controlled by the neighborhood association . Even the street names have in recent years been reduced , strangled into intimacy ? moving beyond earlier schemes based on a theme ( trees , racetracks ) or a letter ( my Levittown development was stuck together on the letter " f " ) ; newer developments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a Windsor Court with a Windsor Mews , a Windsor Drive , Road , Avenue , Lane , and Place . A friend tells me how visiting his mother , having forgotten what Windsor she was living on , and all the houses an identical rosy beige , he drove around desperately in her car ,  | pressing the garage-door opener , waiting to see which door would open to welcome in her car . It 's no wonder we return from these visits " home " dispirited . The developments many of our parents retire into have no connection to childhood for us . Even if our families remain in our hometown , the place is often so drastically altered that our landmarks are as completely obliterated as John Clare 's . We 're left disoriented , unable to find our way to old haunts . Most of the fields and woods are probably gone anyway , and to see a building or a business in American suburbia that has survived intact a twenty- or thirty-year lapse is a rarity . It 's a tissue-paper world , ripping before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because we 've been left so little to rely on , we 're forced into self-protective amnesia . If our places change so radically , so quickly , what do the lives we lived in them mean ? The rhythm of change and persistence , the balance of past and present , has been warped . We ourselves have been thrown out . Maybe my persistent yearning for a full-fledged home derives more from my Jewish background than I 've allowed . Most American Jews come from irretrievably lost places . We remain half-at-home here , alert enough to pack in a hurry if need be , the ghost of the Holocaust too close for comfort . To not belong , to imagine constantly an elsewhere , becomes a chronic unease . It does not compel , or perhaps even allow , loyalty to one 's present place , the making of a solid home . That is the resistance I 'm trying to overcome here finally . When the landscapes we find ourselves in are not diffused with our meanings , our history or community , it 's not easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a natural connection , but must be a forged one . It is easier to turn inward from a strange land than to attempt to bridge the gap . Historically , the physical life of Jews in diaspora , in ghettos , was cramped and oppressive , often literally cut off from the  | cultures that surrounded and ruled them . In compensation , think some , the temporal dimension of Jews ' lives  --  their his-tory  --  gained disproportionate importance . " Their spatial existence was always a tenuous and painful reminder of their isolation from the surrounding world , " says critic Stephen Kern , " and was far less important to them than their existence in time . Thus the Wandering Jew is at home only in time . " Cultural identity had to be internalized , kept abstract , free of attachment to its physical setting . Yiddish is said to be the only folk language in the world that has no base in nature  --  its vocabulary is bereft of plants and animals , almost the entire natural world . Jews have perhaps had a complicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural symbols survive in ritual , Judaism is the religion that by and large defused the tradition of sacred place . This is the religion that imaginatively placed divinity outside nature , the religion in which God , instead of existing as nature , used the forces of nature as punishment ( plagues of locusts , floods ) . Harvey Cox finds it revealing that the Hebrew concept of God " arose in the social context of a nomadic , essentially homeless people . " The pagan gods the early Jews set out to overthrow were the numerous place-defined , local nature deities . For Jews , holy places were not crucial , because their single God was a spirit who could be worshiped anywhere . " Anywhere " meant that the where of one 's life faded in significance . Identity depended on human community and common belief , not on a shared location . That tendency toward placelessness helped define the thinking and writing of numerous artists and intellectuals this century who remain highly influential . Proust is an interesting literary example , a writer for whom the meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The places that we have known belong now only to the little world of space on which we map them for our own convenience . None of them was ever more than a thin slice held between the contiguous impressions  | that composed our life at that time ; remembrance for a particular form is but regret for a particular moment , and houses , roads , avenues , are as fugitive , alas , as the years . " His plaint is close to my own on occasion , close to the fact of quickly vanishing landscapes . But for Proust , the implications are more extreme . Says Kern : " If there is a single illusion that Proust most wanted to dispel it is that life takes place primarily in space . The spaces in which we live close about us and disappear like the waters of the sea after a ship passes through . To look for the essence of life in space is like trying to look for the path of the ship in the water : it only exists as a memory of the flow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we happen to he are ephemeral and fortuitous settings for our life in time , and to try to recapture them is impossible . " Places are ephemeral when they are treated as dispensable , when we are not embraced by their traditions or when the traditions have drained away . Even for exiled modernist James Joyce , Dublin is what solidly persists when chronological time breaks down in his work and fantasy takes over . Place is the concrete , time the fluid . For most of us this century , it is the reverse . " Most individuals feel almost naked without their wristwatches , " notes Wilbur Zelinsky , " but how many carry compasses , maps , or field glasses .... ? " We continuously , unconsciously , transform space into time , say a city is four hours away rather than two hundred miles . E. V. Walter , a sociologist specializing in the study of place , points to Freud as another figure whose temperamental affiliation with time rather than space has had a crucial influence on our thinking . " Freud moved theory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the couch as a vehicle abstracting patient from place . Despite his own existential recognition of the inner need that yearns for place , Freud 's psychology never integrated personal identity with the sense of belonging , and the real power of places . " The mind , for Freud , is very much conceived of as " its own place . "  | Tellingly , Walter points out , Freud even rejects the rich spatial metaphor he invents in Civilization and Its Discontents to explain the mind . There , Freud asks us to imagine the city of Rome with its past entirely visible alongside the present , relics from previous periods occupying the same space as contemporary buildings . But just as we construct such a Rome in our minds , Freud abruptly dismisses the notion  --  because it 's physically impossible . The Rome Freud suggests , though , where Renaissance palaces , ancient walls , temples , and modern office buildings would vie for our attention , is exactly the kind of place the willing visitor creates with tourist manuals and an open mind . In Rome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible to experience a vivid sense of the continuity of human generations in a place . David , Zoe , and I spent several months in 1985 in an apartment on a downtown Roman street whose semicircular curve derived from the ancient Theater of Pompey . In the deep basement of a neighborhood restaurant , one could glimpse remnants of the theater wall . The piazza we looked out over , home to operatic arguments over garbage and the price of bread , was the site of Caesar 's assassination . For me , his imagined cry , sifted through Shakespeare , indelibly mingled there with the screeches of children and the roar of motorbikes . Around the corner , inside the scaffolding and green netting that swathed landmark buildings on nearly every block , I listened as renovating workmen remonstrated with each other , bickering theatrically about tools and strategies . There , too , I distinctly heard other men , from the days of the empire through the Renaissance and baroque , having the same conversations about these very same buildings ? " No , not there , blockhead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel aloud the palimpsest of Roman streets , just as Freud proposed , an evocative clutter that seems remarkably analogous to the workings of a lively mind . Rome 's an ideal metaphor , in truth , for the landscape of fantasy and memory ?  | everything seeming to exist simultaneously , having equal weight and sway . A biographer of Freud concurs that " Today , archeological relics seem quite appropriate as symbols of psychoanalytic procedure and its results . " But while Freud uses archaeological metaphors freely elsewhere in his writing , describing the " unearthing " of his patients ' pasts and the " relics " of their experiences , he allies the cacophonous mental experience of places with hysteria . The mnemonic symbols of cities , for instance  --  monuments and memorials ? are seen as comparable to irrepressible memories of traumatic experience : " Every hysteric and neurotic behaves like a Londoner who might pause in deep melancholy before the memorial of Queen Eleanor 's funeral , instead of going about his business , or who might shed tears before the monument that recalls the ashes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again in far greater brilliance . Hysterical patients suffer from reminis-cences . " Although it may be a matter of degree , Freud 's line of reasoning , asserts historian Joseph Rykwert , rests on the analogy that " close attention to the city 's monuments . . . suggests a sick citizenship . " Instead of recognizing that the symbols and memories of a place are the way people can integrate themselves with a culture , Freud thinks of them as a curable disease . " It seems almost as if he were advocating an indifference to one 's environ-ment , " Rykwert says . Given this stance , Freudian psychology perhaps helped intensify our separation from place . Harold Searles laments that the entire nonhuman environment is virtually ignored by Freud and his successors because of their intense focus on the human personality and human relationships ? " as though the human race were alone in the universe , pursuing individual and collective destinies in a homogenized matrix of nothingness , a background devoid of form , color and substance . " This is our inherited thinking , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not just those historically in diaspora .  | We have been taught to live consciously in time rather than place , with our lives divided into well-defined passages . Without the continuity of place , our sense of time is exaggerated , becomes an omnipresent drama . Wendell Berry , too , wishes psychotherapy were more conscious about restoring our connection to places ? " The lost identity would find itself by recognizing physical landmarks , by connecting itself responsibly to practical circumstances ; it would learn to stay put in the body to which it belongs and in the place to which preference or history or accident has brought it . . . . " But that is not , typically , how nowadays we " find " ourselves . We almost can not when the stage sets on which we play out our lives are struck with each act , ditched . We only have the plot . The where of our immediate past is often unrecognizable , our further past unlocatable . Many of us are unable to trace back our ancestry beyond a generation or two . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really , of what we 've come from , what places and experiences have unbeknownst to us filtered into our personalities , helped shape our values and temperaments . In my case , because my father was orphaned when young , he was n't even sure exactly where his parents had come from . My mother 's family wandered restlessly around Europe and back and forth across the Atlantic so that it 's impossible to know what they thought of as home , if indeed they thought about it at all . No one in my family spoke much about the past . My father , particularly , eschewed it with a tight-lipped shrug ? his shattered childhood was no doubt too painful to retrieve . It was only when he died that we found a shoe box of souvenirs he 'd kept , his infant boots and family photos , a galaxy of ghosts we did n't know we had , faces formally posed at what look like Coney Island booths , or studio portraits from back in Russia , people whose identities we could only guess  --  these two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this their mother , perhaps our great-aunt . Though a few pictures are scribbled on in loose  | Cyrillic , and some framed with Hebrew " Happy New Year , " none is dated , none located , none shows the background of a lived-in place . These my ancestors preferred to be remembered beside a cardboard ivied casement or on a fake park bench , some ideal of gentility that befit their dressed-up notion of themselves . They are all serious , alert but unsmiling . Had they ever felt at home ? I had always wanted to find them . But the closest I came was to learn Russian , to prepare for pilgrimage . And now , unused , even that has been forgotten , and the past dwindles further away . Reaching back to those faraway ghosts is n't going to help me here . The only way I 'll ever feel at home now will be by making a home for myself with the help of local ghosts . By force of circumstances I must do it here , in upstate New York , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With the birth of our second daughter , Clea , we are increasingly homebound . Our trip to Italy will likely be our last out of the country for a while . My pilgrimages are of necessity local now , my adventures in lively conversation and in books , after the kids are asleep . I often read about the pilgrimages of others , anxiously wondering if I can continue to make life-altering discoveries by staying home , pressing more deeply into a single place . I read with fascination about the Hindus in India who are frequently on pilgrimage , who compose their sense of place through their wandering obeisance , and wonder if my more circumscribed wanderings here are somehow comparable . Millions of Hindus routinely set off hundreds or thousands of miles on pilgrimage . They journey to the country 's cardinal points , to twelve sacred " lingas of light " where Siva split t hrough the earth , to thousands of " footprints " of the gods set in stone , to places where great rivers join . The whole of India , in fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literal body of Sati . She is the mother goddess born into the shape of a  | woman , the beloved of Siva , who burned herself to death after an insult . In his grief , Siva danced insanely all over India with her corpse in his arms . To relieve him , the other gods followed behind , cutting off bits of Sati 's body until she was finally gone . Places where her body parts fell became the worshiped " seats " of the goddess also known as Devi , Kali , or Durga . Fifty-one body places , in some traditions io8 , are held sacred . Her skull is enshrined in Calcutta . Her tongue is worshiped in the Punjab , her navel in Puri . Pilgrims often walk for weeks , barefoot , to pay homage to her  --  though nowadays they can also buy a bus ticket for an " official , government-promoted All-India Pilgrimage ' to one or more of her discrete body parts . " There are as well Mother India temples with no image or relic of the goddess at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pilgrims can circumambulate . Such rituals have been an important means of coalescing numerous distinct regions into a nation . Indeed , Surinder Mohan Bhardwaj dedicates his book on Hindu pilgrimage to " the countless dedicated pilgrims whose footprints have given meaning to India as a cultural entity . " Because of this sacralized national identity , the partitions of India that created Bangladesh and Pakistan were painfully protested by religious Hindus as a " vivisection " of the body of Bharat Mata , Mother India . A mythological system of this kind , suggests scholar Diana Eck , composes the landscape and is just as orienting as other forms of geography  --  it creates centers and axes , it defines peripheries , it maps . By the act of ritualistic pilgrimage , mythology becomes a " living geography , " guided by inherent features in the natural landscape as well as places imaginatively sanctified by the deeds of gods . Mass-produced maps of India show these marks of the gods as prominently as railroad stations and post offices . Even with such a film sense of sacred place , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have a sense of place  | about their home landscapes akin to ours . " To emphasize the physical properties of place and the individual 's unique experience of these creates a peculiarly Western mystique of place that is not at home in India , " explains David Sopher . Further , the fundamental notion of maya in Hindu thought , the transitoriness of the material world , demands an ultimate detachment from place . Unlike other cultures where geopiety arises from staying with one 's buried ancestors , the Hindu " seeks death far from home , beside a river that will sweep away forever one 's ashes after cremation " ? a desire to be free of earthly place in favor of cosmic identification . Thus , landscape in India , as for the aborigines of Australia , lends itself most easily to symbol , abode of the divine . The average Indian does n't expect to leave an individual mark on the landscape , does n't expect that significant moments in one 's own life constitute the sites for later , personal pilgrimage . My own pilgrimages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lofty sort , for the most part literary or autobiographical . A book got me to Britanny . Paris I negotiated first while reading Heming-way 's A Moveable Feast , finding the lieux of his reminiscences as a way to begin to take in the city as a lived-in place rather than as spectacle . Now , it 's become stirring to revisit places I 've experienced as powerfully layered with meaning  --  like Carnac or the west of Ireland  --  or even locally , semicomically , to relive Clea 's near-birth in the back seat of our car , two miles from the hospital on Border City Road . Whenever I drive there now , whenever I go over the huge bump of the potholed railroad crossing that tore me up that day , I cringe , I laugh . Ugly as it is , there by the electricity substation and the propane company 's stack of empty tanks , it has joined my own collection of meaningful landscapes , the places by which I assimilate and chart my experiences on earth . No Mecca , no navel of Devi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tie my life together , that tie me here  --  my lovely baby forever associated with eighteenth-  | century wrangling over borders and twentieth-century urban waste , the terrifying thrill of her emergency birth flitting through my mind every time I pass there in the midst of daily chores . To achieve the attachment I hope for here , I need more places like this  --  my life set down before my eyes , the landscape vividly holding my personal past as well as the communal , much as it does for the Apache . But the truth is , there are few enough obvious common places to hold dear in this landscape . The official local mecca , the touristic jewel of the Finger Lakes , which I 've avoided for years and must finally make a small pilgrimage to , is the Rose Hill mansion . Touted in magazines that devote themselves to American antiquities , it is ostentatiously perched on a hill over the northeastern corner of Seneca Lake . The two faces of Geneva : this national historic landmark , a bright white , cupolaed , Ionic-columned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style in America . . . idealistic , exuberant and vital " ; and just over the left-hand border of the photograph , the lived-in , tumbledown shack , its weed-strewn yard populated by kerosene tanks and a broken washing machine , its boarded-up front porch brandishing a handmade " Beware of Dog " sign , a rusted-out Chevy in the driveway right beside where the tourist buses pull in . The shack was the place lit by a kitchen lamp when I drove past at 4:30 in the morning once on my way to an early plane . The yard was an eerie gray-green pool of rubble , the lake two stone 's throws away but invisible . Rose Hill was wearing a floodlit pallor , staring down the dark ; downtown Geneva was only a gold mercuric glow around the rim of the lake . I remembered that Sullivan 's army camped on this hill on the eve of his attack on Ganundasaga . At night when the streets of your cities and villages are silent and you think them deserted , they  | will throng with the returning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land . The white man will never be alone . How often we think we 're alone , in a field , in a car , in the dark , breathing . I 'm unable to look at Rose Hill without clouds of blood and sweat settling into its whitewash . The mansion was built in 1839 . It 's named for Robert Rose , the Virginian who emigrated in 1802 and settled on this site with his large group of slaves . The farm 's early plantation life-style fell apart after the emancipation of New York State slaves in 1827 . It became a notable farm midcentury , though , under the energetic Robert Swan . Swan 's father-in-law , John Johnston , whose farm was contiguous to Rose Hill , was the first farmer in America to lay a tile drainage system  --  sixteen miles long  --  having imported molds for the ceramic tiles from his native Scotland . So successful was his work that he complained that he 'd made his land " too rich for wheat . " Robert Swan had come to study farming with Johnston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father bought him Rose Hill as a wedding present . And there the better-remembered Swan outdid his father-in-law , laying sixty-one miles of ceramic tiles to drain the estate 's wetlands , increasing his yield from five bushels of wheat per acre to fifty . Swan won numerous awards for his agricultural successes and was influential in founding the state agricultural experiment station in Geneva . Downtown on Exchange Street , Thomas D. Burrall was inventing a threshing machine , a grain reaper , and numerous other tools that contributed to the advance of American agriculture and Geneva 's renown . On the day I visit Rose Hill , Geneva 's place in agricultural history is again confirmed with the first release on open American land of a genetically altered virus  --  designed to kill the cabbage looper  --  in a field not far from the Seneca burial mound .  | The original Rose Hill estate ran as far as the eye could see from the upstairs eastern bedrooms . Today , at twenty acres , its boundary is visible , as are two Mennonite girls driving up , improbably , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family now farms part of the old estate . Bonneted in white netting , frocked in full-length flowered cotton , they are not so far in grace from the women who once lived here , though far in means . An early photo of the mansion shows staid , gowned women seated on the portico watching their petticoated daughters politely play croquet on the sloping front lawn . Their view of the lake is mine recaptured at this moment  --  columned , set beyond balustrade , pleasingly framed . For a time , evidently , the grand life got lived here . But by the end of the nineteenth century , the estate had changed hands numerous times , and its new owners could n't maintain its extensive grounds . It became a nursing home , a restaurant , eventually a glorious ruin . It was n't until the 196os that it was bought by Robert Swan 's grandson , renovated , and transformed into a landmark . What 's worth saving and admiring in this building ? Why does it matter ? Other lives were lived here : mostly un-articulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rusticated narcissus straggling up .. . ? Adrienne Rich I am caught between a keen desire for the land to remain marked by the lives that have been lived on it and intolerance for our sentimentalities about the past elite . Nothing much distinguishes the families of Rose Hill except their wealth and Swan 's vanished tiles . I 'm unmoved by the carefully selected Empire-  | period furnishings and expertly restored moldings . Instead , walking through the place in a surly frame of mind , I find myself unexpectedly touched by things rarely pictured or mentioned : the children 's playroom with its piled blocks and a doll dozing in a tiny hammock ; the gold-leaf bedroom suite that was built by prisoners in the Auburn jail ; the double-wedding-ring quilt with its central oval  --  the space where the monograms of the couple and date of marriage were meant to be set  --  in this case a blank field of white : a prepared-for wedding that never took place . Here is the nanny 's room with its cradle for the mistress 's newborns , and the kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few times in her life , the mansion 's hidden hub with its solid maple rolling pins , coal steam irons , and big kettles patinaed by the hands of generations of slaves and hired girls . To touch these things is to sense a life . Pablo Neruda advises : It is well , at certain hours of the day and night , to look closely at the world of objects at rest . Wheels that have crossed long , dusty distances with their mineral and vegetable burdens , sacks from the coalbins , barrels and baskets , handles and hafts for the carpenter 's tool chest . From them flow the contacts of man with the earth ... . Neruda made startling poetry from such close looking , poetry " impregnated with sweat and smoke , " as Irish poet Seamus Heaney describes it , similarly drawn to the artifacts of the ordinary : " It could even be maintained that objects thus seasoned by human contact possess a kind of moral force . They insist upon human solidarity and suggest obligations to the generations who have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The solidity of that covenant  --  the weight of the rolling pin in my hands . I want , like other writers , to bind such mementos to the  | present through the connective tissue of language . I 'll even pay to see them , hungry for a time when the utilitarian and the beautiful were not so divided , consoled to stroke a time when objects still dependably outlived their users . But the tour is moving on to the banquet room . My fellow tourists have paid for grandiose gestures , and that 's what we get in the wellpreserved dining hall , which I 'm now being impatiently herded toward . When did we become so worshipful of an idealized , prettified past ? Until relatively recently , vestiges of history have been allowed to decay or disappear without much concern . I 'll never forget the story of the easygoing Irish work crew instructed by the tourist board to build a stone wall around the ruins of an early church : they dismantled the church and used its stones to build the wall . Colonial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or even hostile , to the past . Liberation from the oppressive aspects of tradition they 'd left behind in Europe was an essential ingredient of the American spirit . In drastic opposition to the Indians ' sense of their ancestors , for instance , Thomas Jefferson announced that " the dead have no rights . They are nothing ; and nothing can not own something .... " To inherit was a form of tyranny . Emerson disdained stone houses as lasting too long . Even a hundred years into our own official history , on the occasion of the centennial of the Declaration of Independence , the celebratory exhibition in Philadelphia showed remarkably little regard for the American past it supposedly saluted . Only one small log cabin tried to reproduce the revolutionary period . According to J. B. Jackson , " There had been a proposal for a demonstration of Colonial fanning techniques , contrasting them with those of 1876 , but nothing came of it . " Instead , the focus was on " the marvels of the present and the promise of the future . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , " Americans love their country , not . . . as it is , but as it will hr . They do not love the land of their fathers ; but are sincerely attached to that which their children are destined to inherit . " Instead of depending on a communal past for our identity , we largely define ourselves by our hope for the future . It is apparent on a daily basis . The new gadget readily replaces the old tool ; what 's old is old-fashioned , headed for the landfill . Says Wendell Berry : " All our implements  --  automobiles , tractors , kitchen utensils , etc. ? have always been conceived by the modern mind as in a kind of progress or pilgrimage toward their future forms . The automobile-of-the-future , the kitchen-of-the-future , the classroom-of-the-future have long figured more actively in our imaginations , plans , and desires than whatever versions of these things we may currently have . " While , at their best , our ambitions lead to genuine human progress , in the trivial material realm , the habit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediate devalues the landscape of the present and permits its throwaway consumption . The religious ideals of early settlers must have helped shape us in this  --  when the hereafter figures more strongly than the here , it 's easy to justify using up land and resources now . We look forward and take whatever we want . Tocqueville noted with astonishment that as ground was broken to build Washington , D.C. , men had " already rooted up trees for ten miles around lest they should interfere with the future citizens of this imaginary metropolis . " In the late nineteenth century , though , under the threat of increasing immigration from unfamiliar countries , there began a shift that encouraged Americans to passionately assert their values , to look back proudly at their own small , accumulated past , and to canonize the founding fathers and their artifacts . Where Grainne and Diarmait and the Hindu gods had slept , George Washington now spent the night . Locally , by 1929 , Sullivan 's founding raid on Geneva ( " severe but salutary " ) was a proud enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A Historical Pageant of De-cision  --  Why the Republic Westward Grew . " The pageant drew between 50,000 and 75,000 people to Geneva , more than any other occasion before or since . On the sloped lawns of White Springs Farm ( site of a former Seneca village wiped out by smallpox , plundered of hundreds of skeletons , pots , and trinkets ) , a five-acre natural stage was set . For four hours , a cast of 2,500 re-created Sullivan 's devastating march and its political payoff as represented in an epilogue ? " Washington 's Dream Comes True . " Cannons boomed , hundreds of horses , cows , squealing pigs , and honking geese did their bit , Indians " died , " and a hundred girls performed a minuet . Here as elsewhere , a WASP heritage was now something to flaunt . The past quickly became commodity ; colonial relics provided a palpable connection to the nation 's origins and carried status as increasing demand outstripped supply . By the time of the bicentennial , we were firmly in the grip of nostalgia . Nostalgia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1678 for the disease of homesickness . Its symptoms included insomnia , anorexia , palpitations , stupor , and the persistent thinking of home . Nostalgia was described in European medical encyclopedias up until the nineteenth century as fatal . The illness progressed from " a sad , melancholy appearance , a bemused look , . . . an indifference toward everything " to " the near impossibility of getting out of bed , an obstinate silence , the rejection of food and drink ; emaciation , marasmus and death . " Prognosis was said to depend entirely on whether or not the patient could be sent home . Victims of nostalgia probably died of meningitis , gastroenteritis , and tuberculosis , but " because everyone believed nostalgia fatal , it so became . " To travel far or long from home was to risk your life . Armies were frequently beset by the malady , leading one Russian general in 1733 to announce that " any soldier incapacitated by nostalgia would be buried alive . " Two or three burials put an end to that particular  | epidemic . French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave . Prophylactically , Swiss soldiers were forbidden to play , sing , or whistle alpine melodies , whose effect was known to be swift and disastrous . Remarkably , the U.S. surgeon general still recognized nostalgia as a contagious disorder in army induction centers during World War II . Young women of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries were also frequently struck with nostalgia , especially girls sent away from home as servants . Homesickness was a plausible explanation for the fires such miserable girls sometimes set in their employers ' homes , or even for murder , as in the case of a nursemaid " who killed her four-year-old charge one night and calmly admitted the crime the following morning . Her only motive . . . was that she felt she could go home if she killed the child . " The effects of displacement were keenly acknowledged in such cases . The meaning of nostalgia shifted in the nineteenth century , though , from being primarily a geographical disease to a psychological one rooted in time . Rather than the loss of home , it came to indicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Freud turned it into regression . The importance of place had already eroded , overtaken by consciousness of time . " The decline of the theory of nostalgia coincided with the decline of particularism in the provinces , " says Jean Starobinski  --  the decline of local rituals and social structures . For us , nostalgia inevitably suggests sentimentality , a useless longing for something no longer possible . But we might consider it as part and parcel of our rootlessness , our feeling of not particularly belonging where we happen to be . The oft-quoted " Where are the snows of yesteryear ? " implies , as Robert Heilman comments , that the snows have been moved somewhere else , a place we might , with luck , find . Nostalgia is built of dislocation , discontinuity . It is a response to the disquiet of upheaval . " Asian villagers living for generations in one place  | would be baffled by nostalgia , " says Russell Baker . " It is an affliction of traveling races who do not like where they have arrived and have no taste for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by now that we anticipate looking back in the midst of enjoyment , look forward to watching the videos we 're taking of our children even as we make them . " Make every moment a memory , " demands the photogra-pher 's studio . " I am looking to the future with nostalgia , " the elder Mayor Daley once told Chicagoans . Yet only very choice images or sites in the landscape attract our nostalgic instinct to preserve . The American past is either neglected , actively destroyed , or selectively museumed , rarely lived in or understood as a whole . It is " fenced off in a preserve called History , " says David Lowenthal . " It is always in quotation marks and fancy dress . " And it is rarely seen as something whose meaning adheres to its location  --  you do n't necessarily find the past where it occurred , but where it 's convenient to tourists ( like Mary Jemison 's cabin hauled out of the gorge ) . That someone 's home should retain meaning as visual biography when moved a hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environment we really have and what a convenient , thoughtless nostalgia we indulge in . ( What brought tears to my eyes in the room where Keats died in Rome was not anything preserved inside , but the view out his window , perched over the Spanish Steps , raucous with lives going on  --  knowing he gazed out at that perpetual , lively bustle as he lay dying . ) So little is saved anymore , I end up feeling grudgingly grateful for Rose Hill  --  which at least values its setting and has no one prancing around in a period costume making canned speeches . There are so few sites commemorated in the region . Nearby , in the Syracuse area , the book Architecture Worth Saving in Onondaga County became obsolete a decade after it was  | published  --  so many of the pinpointed buildings were destroyed between the mid-sixties and mid-seventies . Geneva itself has just lost an unlikely but evocative land-mark  --  the Agway Tower , a white concrete grain silo set smack in the middle of the downtown . To many it was an eyesore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But since its demolition to make way for new lakefront development , it 's been oddly missed . The 19o-foot-high tower was built in 1937 ? a stark , slim rectangle rising ambitiously from a squat base . It was so sturdily made that when it came time to destroy it , the wrecker 's ball bounced playfully off the walls for days . The Agway Tower had been a controversial building from the start  --  it was the first commercial building to compete with Geneva 's skyline of church spires . The worry of the pious was not altogether unsound . My friend Marvin tells the story of how his young daughter always figured that because God was much too tall to crouch down inside a human house , his earthly shelters were necessarily inside church spires  --  and the Agway Tower . Arthur Dove made the tower secularly sacred by painting it over and over , first as the stark white industrial building it was , in Cereal Mill , and then as Building Moving Past a Sky , a tumultuous dark oil full of cold fronts and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mill Abstraction , the tower lifting off its base , surrounded by whimsical , flattened , Mirolike shapes and colors  --  a calligraphic fancy . Never has Geneva looked so purple , turquoise , and burgundy , recognizable only by that signal tower . Dove was getting rapidly bored with his exile here . Even though for many the Agway Tower was associated with all-night grueling labor during harvest season , its absence has been registered by those who once worked there , brought their grain , joked and drank coffee there , or simply used it daily to gauge distance and the day 's visibility . Their sense of loss is  | dismissed by those who applaud the removal of the odd-looking building and the land it freed up for envisioned tourists . For me it was the landmark I sleepily aimed the car toward each morning , and it was , too , a pleasing reminder of Dove , a concrete memento of the play of the imagination , a vision of buildings moving past skies . For future generations , Dove 's vision will be all that remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even fail to identify them with Geneva . A piece of the place 's definition has broken loose . Even for a newcomer like me , Geneva is less anchored without that high beacon . Its commercial arteries and development plans swell , but as its land is rearranged , its highway moved to make room for a hotel , the commonest part of its past is eliminated and it loses its distinction . A one-of-a-kind building , born of the local economy , will be replaced with the imported design of a chain hotel . Tourism , based on the distinctions in places , so frequently requires , to sustain itself , the elimination of those very distinctions . Given our technology , whole landscapes can be cleared in a day . A familiar stretch of land can readily disappear beneath a parking lot or reservoir . Warfare annihilates vegetation and terrain ; deep plowing alters land as previous forms of cultivation and grazing could not ; industrial pollution , landfills , mass tour-ism  --  all are culpable , and so too , sometimes , is our zeal for knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bristlecone pine 4,900 years old  --  was cut down to determine its age .

We left , ironically , during the most beautiful months of the year , almost entirely missing the region 's short period of plenitude . It was only when our annual travel plans were thwarted by Zoe 's and Clea 's quite different needs that we spent our first summer here , put in the first garden I 'd grown since Ireland , and connected ourselves to another season and rhythm of the place . We 've stayed every summer since . As much as I love the lush summers , I am , I have to come clean , violently allergic to most of the natural world .

My natural world is not , for the most part , hands-on ; it is , rather , in the shape of things  --  the old sense of landscape . But the vegetable garden is a tolerable risk , especially if I let David do most of the weeding . I 'll do more than sing to it ( I have a friend whose interest is confined to walking behind her gardening partner crooning , " Plant a radish , get a radish " ) . In fact I look forward to the feel of soil in my hands , love to sow and pamper plants , to harvest them , or simply to squat in the sun at the edge of the garden after two days of torrential rain , listening to the bluster of the nearby creek .

Our garden , though large enough to keep us busy all summer , is a minute patch among the acres of fields that surround us . We live close to Kendaia now , on the eastern side of the lake  --  a shift of perspective after nearly five years . Our cliff-top rented house on the western shore was reclaimed by its owners ; we had to move . It was a sorrow , a panic at first . But surviving the transplant , I 've found that my sense of place here is not housebound or overly specific  --  it has been flung out into the wider landscape so that though our new rented house is twenty miles from where we were ( four by goose flight over the lake ) , we are very much in a known landscape , equally loved . Our mailing address is now Geneva , though we 're ten miles from downtown and in a different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town . Boundaries crisscross and blur out here , snagged in history . Our house is a small white dot in the cleared land of the  | military tracts . One whole horizon is corn . The lake is a flicker between trees , a short stroll down , sunset instead of sunrise on the water . This house sits more firmly on the land than the first one , into which the lake beckoned at all hours , a constant invitation to voyage . Here , with few trees left , among pedestrian hardworking fields of corn , alfalfa , wheat , and hay , I finally feel more grounded , more like a settler . With the lake at arm 's length , and pickups and tractors meandering past on East Lake Road , there can be no illusion of being islanded . We are firmly in the wide world and ca n't ignore the land 's broad , rolling insistence .

When I 'm spading a row and see a swirl of yellow jackets over a hole at the end , angrily declaring the territory their own , I 'm happy enough to desist , end the row a foot early . Those days that I 'm indifferent and watch the weeds accumulate , I content myself with the Seneca explanation : " If you do not feel like working in your garden , someone has passed a spell on you . To counteract it , burn tobacco and tell the spell to go back where it originated . Go there to whoever hired you and get in their way . ' " Well , I 'm allergic to smoke , too , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be spellbound when it 's time to mow the lawn . The lawns out here are enormous , comically estatelike in proportion to the puny ranch houses and trailers . Our neighbors patrol theirs on the backs of tractor mowers , never letting the grass get long enough to nod . We , on the other  | hand , put off mowing till the last possible moment  --  when we 're eliciting stern glances from passing cars . Lawns are unquestioned in America , so " normal " a fact of the landscape that we ca n't quite imagine living without them . But attachment to our manicured yards seems absurd alongside our typical treatment of the land . Notes J. B. Jackson : " The slightest excuse is enough for us to strip an entire countryside . And yet  --  there is the front yard with its tenderly cared-for Chinese elms , the picnic ground in the shadow of the pines .... " The tender care is rather haphazard at our place . Two hundred years ago , we would n't have gotten away with it . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your land , for instance . " Once in each of the following months  --  May , June , July , August , and September and any owner or occupant of any lands in the Town of Seneca who shall neglect or refuse to cut the Canada Thistle , he shall forfeit and pay for each month he shall so neglect . . . . " The thistle was ranked second only to the redroot in its " evil influences , " a leading player in the moral drama of domesticated land . I do occasionally fantasize about a more perfect garden , usually early in the season when it 's still catalog lovely . I especially ponder how I 'd frame it , protect it , set it off from the ragged lawn . I think I 'd surround it , first of all , with a stone wall , the kind so common in Ireland , made of the stones unearthed in the opening of the land , added to every time you dig deeper . A waist-high gray sculpture of a wall . " Garden " does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And as Michael Pollan wisely meditates on it , a garden is a place " that is at once of nature and unapologetically set against it . " So I think about walls and boundaries , the inherited habit of setting off the places we love In the night , when all is silence , In the night , when all is darkness ,  | When the Spirit of Sleep , Nepahwin , Shuts the doors of all the wigwams , So that not an ear can hear you , So that not an eye can see you , Rise up from your bed in silence , Lay aside your garments wholly , Walk around the fields you planted , Round the borders of the corn-fields , Covered by your tresses only , Robed with darkness as a garment . Thus the fields shall be more fruitful , And the passing of your footsteps Draw a magic circle round them , So that neither blight nor mildew , Neither burrowing worm nor insect , Shall pass o'er the magic circle Longfellow claims to have gotten this from early settlers ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hiawatha , " he describes the belief in the magic circle as being authentic : A singular proof of this belief , in both sexes , of the mysterious influence of the steps of a woman on the vegetable and insect creation , is found in an ancient custom , which was related to me , respecting cornplanting . It was the practice of the hunter 's wife , when the field of corn had been planted , to choose the first dark or overclouded evening to perform a secret circuit , sans habilement , around the field . For this purpose she slipped out of the lodge in the evening , unobserved , to some obscure nook , where she completely disrobed . Then , taking her matchecota , or principal garment , in one hand , she dragged it around the field . This was thought to insure a prolific crop , and to prevent the assaults of insects and  | worms upon the grain . It was supposed they could not creep over the charmed line . There are numerous hints that Iroquois women did on occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were " demonstrably fertile , " symbolically contributing their fertility to the ground . Contemporary farming on Iroquois reservations , though , observes taboos against menstruating women doing the planting , and even advises against pregnant women walking through the fields . So the tradition , as elsewhere , is ambivalent . Mircea Eliade describes East Prussian women sowing peas while naked , and women in Finland sprinkling furrows with breast milk . The object of such practices , he says , " is certainly to make the crop thrive , but also to protect it against the evil eye or the depredations of rabbits . " Pliny mockingly reports ancient Roman rituals similar to what Longfellow describes : " Another method , too , of preventing caterpillars , is to make a woman . . . go around each tree , barefooted and ungirth . . . an absurd notion . . . . " Whatever about caterpillars , it would create a memorable boundary in my own vision of the place . And who would dare cross me ? ! The desire to make a magic circle abides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a symbolic center . Groups as well as individuals seem to require a marked center from which to observe the rest of the world . On both cosmological and geographical maps , of course , people almost invariably place themselves at the center . Countless holy places  --  like Stonehenge  --  enclose a circle , create a navel . Numerous cultures fix the mythic center of the world at an omphalos . Even nomads carry the means of a center with them ; they erect it  --  as a fire , for example  --  when they set up camp . And the artist often lays claim to the world aesthetically from a chosen vantage point . " About an hour this side of Albany  | is the Center of the World  --  I own it , " declared painter Frederick Church in the tradition of self-conscious observer-landowners . A defined circle gives people a sense of power and confidence , akin to the extraordinary strength of animals in their home territory . Our own weak encirclements in open space , our mowed lawns setting us off from the chaos of forests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Up until the sixteenth century , Europeans confidently believed themselves to be at the center of the universe , stars and sun whirling around at a respectful distance . Copernicus 's assertion of a heliocentric system , moving earth to the periphery , was truly unbalancing , fundamentally disturbing to the human sense of placement . Because the planet itself lacks obvious reference points for the placing of a center , symbolic centers are of necessity self-made , local . The making of such a center is typically accompanied by elaborate ritual . In ancient Rome , for example , a new town had to be physically marked out first , cut off from the chaotic space around it . Several forms of augury preceded even the selection of the site . Intense care was essential because the founding of a town was seen as in some sense equivalent to the founding of the world , and the setting of its center was the crucial first step . " That is why , " says Joseph Rykwert , " the place on which it is built can not arbitrarily or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be discovered ' through the revelation of some divine agency . " The literal physical circle of Roman settlements was created first by a plow . So charmed and charged with power was this cutting of the boundary that when the plow reached the location for the town 's obligatory three gates , it was lifted , carried across the land ( a portage for the porta ) to leave open an unsanctified space through which daily life could flow . The walls followed the cut line . Despite the animation of the boundary by human or animal sacrifice , the charm of its walls and standing stones did need to  | be periodically reinforced , and so communities annually paraded around their borders , visiting holy stones and groves along the way . These ritualistic perambulations live on in the Christian era , transformed into Rogationtide , the " beating of the parish bounds . " Still widely practiced in rural England each spring , the procession is used both to symbolically confirm parish borders and to seek God 's blessing for the newly planted crops . Though organized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pagan festival at heart , ritualistically enacting the definition of place . In the days before surveyors and deeds , such a tradition was no doubt essential for passing down crucial information ? circling the bounds was a geography lesson , especially for the young . When the ritual was less casual and merry , when stones were still believed powerful , participants would cut wood wands with which to strike and " reenergize " them , and children would be beaten at important landmarks and thrown into ditches  --  perhaps a remnant of human sacrifice , or simply a way to enhance their memory of the stones ' locations . Perambulations were also performed in times of crisis  --  such as a siege or an epidemic ? to strengthen the enclosure 's defenses . Because boundaries are essentially protective , the punishment for violating them was extreme . Crossing a boundary without authorization was a desecration , a threat to the place 's defensive shield , and was typically punished by death . For leaping the city wall , Remus got killed by Romulus . The Bible and folktales from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tampering with landmark stones : " Cursed be he that removes his neighbor 's landmark . " In Swedish legend , Jack-o ' - Lantern was a mover of landmarks and therefore doomed to wander the night , haunting boundary lines , forever . Lighting a sinister-faced pumpkin each Halloween is an unconscious reminder of the ancient injunctions of defined place . In secular terms , boundaries are potent because political  | stability depends on an ordered , respected landscape . Observed boundaries reduce conflict . ( " Good fences make good neigh-bors . " ) Boundaries enforce the social order , too . In early New England villages , hierarchically arranged outward from their centers , trespass was construed as a crime not only against property , but against social rank . We continue to honor bor-ders  --  from fences to frontiers  --  with a sense of prohibition equal in intensity to the authority of the religious . Ownership for us , private property , has taken on the taboos of the holy . Eliade argues that a completely secular experience of the landscape is really impossible . Secular people tend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property , but with individual privileged places  --  the sacred places of one 's private universe  --  and set them off imaginatively as hallowed : for instance one 's birthplace , the first foreign city ever visited , the scenes of first love , of life-altering decisions or events . Like Carnac and Border City Road for me , these are our version of landmarks . In common usage , landmarks are more often the names of banks and gas stations we jot down on a scrap of paper while taking directions to an unknown destination . They are mundane , impermanent . You tell people to turn right by the Gulf station , and overnight it 's turned into a Sunoco . But even unlikely landmarks can become charged , as with some San Francisco gang members who dedicated parking spaces in their neighborhoods as memorials to dead comrades . " Keep Out ' was painted in one shrine to honor a slain gang member who had customarily parked there . Police say a motorist who ignored the warning was shot and killed . " There 's sacred place  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier traditions , hallowed places could not be created by personal resonance , but only by their association with a god . For the Romans , the spirit of the place , the genius loci , meant literally the begetter of the place . A temple built at a sacred place was meant to " locate " the divinity , and was under-  | stood as an extension of the god 's presence in the land . In this country , one could create a sacred grove by cutting down trees in the middle of the woods and having a revival meeting . But for the ancients , the holiness of the place came first , the shrine after , in response . Nemos was the name used in ancient Greece for a sacred , enclosed tract of land ; its inherent power , its protective goddess , was Nemesis  --  the avenger of trespass by those not properly prepared for the sacred . We 've secularized nemesis into that which we ca n't best  --  an ungrounded abstraction . The concept of moira suffered the same displacement ; we translate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literally an " allotted portion " ? the place individual gods were assigned to rule in accordance with how their characteristics matched the landscape . " The original conception of moira , " Erich Isaac explains , " thus turns out to be spatial rather than temporal . We are to think of a system of provinces , coexisting side by side , with clearly marked bounda-ries . " To better understand the Greek gods , suggests Paula Philippson , we 'd do well to examine their assigned landscapes . Whose assigned landscape is Seneca Lake ? In dead of winter , early morning , huge columns of mist erupt from the warmish surface of the water , rise into the icy air , and let sunlight prism through them , become dancing rainbowed goddesses , subject only to the building heat of the sun . By afternoon they 've vanished . The lake is turbulent , sullen . And now the trees are hypnotized by sudden snow , a lake-effect squall , black clouds blasting across the water and dumping themselves on the eastern shore , an inch in minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across fields . I chase after , dazed by the sudden blankness , the closing down of the sky , as if a god had stamped its foot , turned its back , and let the world turn a terrifying , unbound white , shelterless . Where can we turn ? For the Seneca , local spirits could be found everywhere ?  | underground , in rocks , riding the lake . If you believed and were courteous , you could hear them . One , the Talking Stone , could tell the story of everything that had ever happened here . This happened in the time when men and animals lived as brothers and could understand each other 's language . Listen ! This happened in the time when people could understand the language of stones . I stop in the woods as the snow thins out , let it accumulate quietly on my hair and gloves . The trees creak . The stones are dumb , hidden . How far down am I willing to listen ? One August night , shortly after moving to East Lake Road , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly there was a boom , an explosive shudder in the windowpanes , our shoddy bookshelves swaying . We looked up , startled . A plane crashing at the depot ? Or , God forbid . . . David laughed  --  here by Kendaia , at virtual ground zero , we would n't even have time to look up . Back in 1941 , in response to local fears of the possibility of explosions in storage igloos at the depot , a Colonel Parker confidently declared that " other than a loud noise , a rattle of windowpanes , and a subsequent ringing in the ears , there would be no injury . " What do they think they 'd get away with telling us these days ? Another boom . Maybe thunder . But no , the sky was clear and calm . Maybe we 'd just heard the lake 's spiritowner speak  --  the legendary lake gun . Lake guns , or death drums of the Seneca , are the periodic booms reported by lakeside residents for centuries , an eerie phenomenon out of history and myth that persists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evenings , sometimes on icy mornings ; they sound like distant cannons . The supposed Seneca explanation was floridly recorded by George Conover : Among the braves of the tribe there was one , straight as an arrow whose regal form towered above all others . Agayentah . One day , out hunting , he took  | shelter from an impending storm under a large tree on the bank of the lake . Amid a roaring of thunder and a hurricane of wind there came a death-winged shaft of lightning that dealt both tree and warrior a fatal blow . The tempest hurled the two lifeless trunks down the embankment and into the water . The next morning , while the Seneca braves were filling the land with lamentation , there appeared on the surface of the water something like the trunk of a tree standing erect , protruding about two feet . With the next storm it began its ceaseless wandering , sometimes against the wind , sometimes with the wind , sometimes disappearing for a period , and then reappearing and resuming its ceaseless march . The " Wandering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though it was known to the Indians as the " Wandering Chief . " It is said that strange noises presage the advance of the " Wandering Jew " and that during the quiet and death-like stillness that precedes an approaching tempest , and at evening also , whenever the setting sun covers the water with bloody tints , may be distinctly heard , as symbolic of the tragic events we have related , those wonderful sounds familiarly known as the " Lake guns of the Seneca . " Agayentah is on the march . It would be nice to assign those watery exclamations to the inexplicable , imagine them the sighs of a rootless wanderer , cousin to myself . But science hypothesizes that the booms are small gas explosions , and the marching trees the result of a strong undertow . My colleague Bill Ahrnsbrak says it 's more than a coincidence that reports of the guns have diminished  | since gas fields were opened on the lakeshore . Poking holes provided another outlet for the gas  --  a kind of antacid , he jokes , to keep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lake burp once back in 1905 : a large flattish dome rising out of the water , fifteen to twenty feet across , three or four feet high , suddenly popping . It 's hard not to mystify or personify the earth 's powers at such moments , not to feel overawed by how little we finally know of it , how in its sway we are when it decides to act up or quake . It was under the spell of the Irish landscape that I first let awe lead me to study primitive and mystical conceptions of the earth . I was reading William Irwin Thompson 's book , Passages About Earth , about power points , the notion that lines of energy surround the earth and that where they intersect we find particularly charged , resonant places on the planet . In ancient cultures , people known for their spiritual abilities slept on identified power points . These were the places early temples were built . The idea had personal resonance , for Thompson tells the story of St. Colman , the outlawed , esoteric early Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power points of Lindisfarne and Iona , ended up building a monastery on my obscure Irish island in 667 A.D. ? a holy refuge I passed the ruins of daily . Colman and his monks practiced an ecstatic brand of Christianity close to nature  --  St. Cuthbert of Lindisfarne prayed while standing in the sea surrounded by animals and birds . The places these monks gravitated to were deemed to have unusual natural powers . If Lindisfarne and Iona were acknowledged power points , so then , I figured , must my island be , chosen by Colman as sanctuary . The idea jibed well with the intensity of my experience of the place . And my education in poetry made me susceptible to the notion too , for , as Thompson explains , it was this archaic heritage of sacred place that was " resurrected by the romantic poets , especially Wordsworth , who tried to show that  | there was a special affinity between altered states of consciousness and unusual points in the landscape . " It had certainly been my experience that particular places on the island  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the ordinary and provoke poems the way Wordsworth 's landscape provoked him : The anchor of my purest thoughts , the nurse , The guide , the guardian of my heart , and soul Of all my moral being Out of the blue Marvin mentions to me that this area of the Finger Lakes rests within a " sacred triangle " marked by three power points , a landscape long recognized as particularly fertile spiritually . The same kind of power points as Thompson talks about ? Have I by some fluke stumbled onto another spiritually resonant place ? Where are these points , I ask him , and what has happened here to suggest their power ? Marvin points to the Iroquois longhouse line , old trees and springs he visits , covens near Ithaca . He has a living map in his mind . Power points , lines of power , and fields of benevolent force are ideas held by a number of cultures , notably the Chinese , who , " since at least the 2nd century BC , have regarded the earth as a living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body . Just as the human body incorporates channels along which its life blood pulsates , so it was thought that the earth included similar channels , sometimes described as the veins of the earth . ' . . . Parts of the earth which are favorably sited lie at points where such channels converge . . . . " As in the Chinese practice of acupuncture , these earthly channels must be left unblocked in order for energy  --  the life force of ch'i , which links spirit and substance  --  to circulate freely . Ch'i is often visualized as a dragon , its body and even its arteries outlined in the curves of mountains and rivers . Maxine Hong Kingston 's fictional woman warrior is mythologically tutored in the forces of the dragon in order to gain her supernatural strength :  | " You have to infer the whole dragon from the parts you can see and touch , " the old people would say . . . . Dragons are so immense , I would never see one in its entirety . But I could explore the mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . When climbing the slopes , I could understand that I was a bug riding on a dragon 's forehead as it roams through space . ... In quarries I could see its strata , the dragon 's veins and muscles ; the minerals its teeth and bone . ... I had worked the soil , which is its flesh , and harvested the plants and climbed the trees , which are its hairs . I could listen to its voice in the thunder and feel its breathing in the winds , see its breathing in the clouds . . . . In the spring when the dragon awakes , I watched its turnings in the river . But it is not only in myth that the Chinese pay their respects to the dragon . Site selection for temples and even houses depends on the recognition of and alignment with the channels of ch'i , for human health is seen as intimately related to terrestrial health . The idea is applied even to the dead . Chinese graveyards were for centuries laid out by a geomancer , an adept using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . " The geomancer sees in the lay of the land  --  the arrangement of hills , valleys , rivers , and a sensation of what lies between and beneath them  --  the presence of benevolence or danger . Assuring the right location for an ancestor 's bones is regarded as crucial to a family 's future . " Even the slightest shift in the skull 's location or the excavation for a rival grave nearby could adversely affect this delicate relationship between living and dead . . . . Whole lineages were said to have declined or even disappeared because of interference with the ancestral bones . " Because the siting of virtually all buildings traditionally depended on its principles , the practice of feng-shui had a pro-  | found influence on shaping China 's landscapes and cities . In fact , it 's been seen , less mystically , as a kind of town-and -- country planning responsible for the notable beauty and harmony of the Chinese landscape . Feng-shui principles even determined the layout of the Great Wall . And they often worked , until recently , to preserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explains it , when Europeans arrived to industrialize the country , " they were informed that their railways and factories could not take certain routes or occupy certain positions . The reasons given were impossible to understand , for they had no relevance , economic , social or political , to the problem of laying out an industrial network . The Europeans were told that a certain range of hills was a terrestrial dragon and that no cutting could be made through its tail . " It amazed the Chinese , Michell says , that materially advanced Europeans could actually be ignorant of geomancy , " so culturally retarded that they could see no further than the visible surface of the landscape . " Another researcher , Paul Devereux , thinks of the geomancer 's sensitivity to the land as an unusual environmental consciousness . He wonders whether conditions like radon concentrations , for example , are what the geomancer recognizes as " bad breath " at a site . Unlike other forms of Chinese divination , which depend on the interpretation of random patterns , geomancy asserts that the qualities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth . Just as with James Lovelock 's Gaia hypothesis  --  which regards the planet as self-regulating  --  for the traditional Chinese the earth is unquestionably a living system . Lovelock has said , " I find that country people still living close to the earth often seem puzzled that anyone should need to make a formal proposition as obvious as the Gaia hypothesis . For them it is true and always has been . " In England , there 's been an explosion of interest in these  | ideas since the early seventies . English writers speak of channels of energy as ley lines , a term derived from Alfred Watkins 's 1925 book , The Old Straight Track . Watkins had exhaustively charted Stone Age tombs , mounds , standing stones , dolmens , and notches cut into hills and was startled to discover an uncanny tendency for them to occur in lines of many miles ' length . Pre-Reformation churches , built on earlier holy sites , also fit into the alignments . Watkins was unsure of the meaning of the lines he discovered ; he speculated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " lines " on the land occur in a number of places . They exist in this country in California and in the Southwest , lines dozens of miles long etched by the early Indians . In South America , lines , geometric designs , and animal figures , such as the famous Nazca geoglyphs of Peru , can be seen clearly from the air . The Nazca lines cover an area about sixty miles long and several miles wide and were made , probably in the sixth century , by removing stones from the lighter colored sand and gravel beneath . The lines rise over precipitous hills , without seeming destination , useless as paths . They are , rather , pattern : a set of lengths systematically recurs ; some lines evidently mark solstice and equinoctial points and the constellations . Prior to their rediscovery in the forties , they had been ignored by the local inhabitants for centuries , their significance a source of bewilderment . Radiating lines found at an Incan site in Cuzco , Peru , seem , from early explorers ' comments , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a possible connection between such lines and kingship , pointing out that the Proto-Indo-European root reg meant " movement along a straight line . " From that root we derive words like " rex , " " regent , " " reign , " as well as " right , " " regiment , " and " regular . " The modern English word " ruler " is of course both a leader and a straight edge for  | making a line . Straight lines may thus , in hierarchical societies , have been associated with the movement of the king , who literally " ruled the land . " Lines on the land may , then , be political or religious in origin or , as for the Australian aborigines , part of a mythic system or , akin to the Chinese notion , mark the route of powers inherent in the land itself . John Michell has been a leading voice in taking up that last idea . Along with others in the last fifteen years , he has hypothesized that clusters of British megalithic sites and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ builders were actually aware of and marked with their monuments . He looks to such traditions as the fairy tracks that still abide in Irish folklore : " These paths , sometimes visible as old roads , sometimes preserved only in local memory , were said to be the routes of seasonal processions . On a certain day the fairies passed through the land , and anyone who stood in their way might be struck dead or be taken off never to return . A man whose house happened to be situated on a fairy path must on that day leave his front and back door open , for it was unwise to obstruct the fairy parade . " There is even a story of a man being advised to cut off the corner of his house after years of bad luck  --  it was in the way of a path . He complied . An Irish seer explains the paths as " lines of some kind of magnetic current , whose exact nature had lately been forgot-ten . " However fanciful such talk might sound , there does seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the human record concerning straight lines in the landscape . " Recent research identifies many of the lines and early monuments as occurring in fault zones . The Great Serpent Mound in Ohio  --  that quarter-mile-long earth-sculpted snake  --  is built over an unusually compressed area of intensive faulting . Carnac is hemmed by fault systems and sits atop France 's most volatile tectonic region . The geological forces that lie behind faults , jumbling many minerals near the earth 's surface , can cause  | anomalies in electromagnetic currents , alteration in groundwater levels , and variations in gravity and radiation . Fault lines may thus help explain leys and dragon lines . In the Chinese practice of feng-shui , straight lines are in fact feared because energy travels too quickly along them . This is combated by making winding paths ( which show up via Chinese influence in nineteenth-century English gardens ) . Another protective measure is to build a " spirit wall " in front of the entrance to a building , creating , in Nigel Pennick 's words , " a corner unnegotiable by straight-line fliers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese houses were set at different heights from those of their neighbors  --  to discourage too strong a current passing across them . Explains Michell : " The lines of the dragon current run straight across country , but locally their course should be modified by a series of gentle curves . " It 's imagined by investigators of ley lines that Britain 's Stone Age builders were more like surveyors , attuned enough with the earth to have recognized these channels and have marked them with mounds , stones , clumps of trees on hilltops , and notches cut into ridges . Their purpose , unlike the curve-cautious Chinese , might have been to harness energy . When writer Eleanor Munro stumbled on an alignment of hills and circles of standing stones in the Hebrides , she described feeling as if she 'd " strayed across a connection as live as a high tension wire , and my mind flickered with the shock of it . " Indeed , less metaphorically , a number of researchers have reported electric shocks and being thrown back from stones while investigating them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of control in the vicinity of some sites . At Carnac , the stones seem to divide a stable geomagnetic field from a zone of disturbed magnetism . Ultrasound readings at stone circles have shown irregular , high activity around particular stones and " holes " of unusually low activity within circles . Researchers speculate whether such  | anomalies could have been perceived by the builders of megalithic monuments . There is one way , at least , the earth 's energy can manifest itself visibly  --  in light . The phenomenon of earth lights has been noted for centuries . Early miners used the appearance of balls of light near the ground as means of locating veins of copper and tin . Lights are also well documented as appearing along fault lines  --  they are sometimes associated with earthquakes and may at other times be indicative of lower levels of tectonic disturbance . Such lights are described as multicolored , variously shaped , and mobile . They sometimes singe the vegetation around which they hover . They sound surprisingly like descriptions of UFOs . And indeed what previous societies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an underground world , or as evidence of telluric energy , we , given our estrangement from the land , are inclined to view as extraterrestrial . One researcher , Michael Persinger , working with the assumption that earth lights manifest disruptions in the electromagnetic field , has observed in the laboratory the effects on the brain in proximity to such disruptions . Subjects report visions , the feeling of floating , loss of their sense of time , the hearing of externalized voices , erotic sensations  --  all typical of the descriptions people report of close encounters with supposed UFOs . It may be that proximity to earth lights causes an altered state of consciousness . And it could be that this altered state was valued by earlier cultures as part of religious ritual , and that the sites of its occurrence were marked and hallowed . Recent research has revived interest , too , in the way megalithic sites may have been celestially keyed . Repeatedly , as at Carnac , observers find signs that megalithic stones mark the solstices , equinoxes , and the transits of the moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has stunned those who have investigated them . Evidence at the sites indicates that they were redesigned numerous times , over generations , Stonehenge at  | least five times . There may have been an experimental process at work , refinements in design . In this view , stone circles may have been used as part of an elemental science involving natural energies best generated under certain astronomical conditions . In England , ley hunters scour the countryside , tracking down the invisible . They have remapped the British landscape , crisscrossed it with lines . Where the leys intersect , they often find mounds or stones to mark the spot . And they often find animals standing on them  --  those natural adepts at recognizing energies we may have lost the simplicity to feel . Although there is a mound on a farm up the road where cows loiter , I do n't expect the invisible geography of this place to reveal itself to me so readily . No dowser I  --  more often a doubter . I drive back to the mound at Ganundasaga . It remains low , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I know it has as its ancestors the larger monuments of Native American Mound Builders , several of which have been found within a few miles of where Mary Jemison lived . Maybe they mean more than burial . Maybe they 're as resonantly placed as Carnac or Jemi-son 's tract . One , in Newark , Ohio , is a startling sculptural array of circles , squares , and octagons built of earth , covering four square miles . The intricate design is dissected now by downtown modern Newark , and the octagon and its surrounding flattopped mounds have been handily transformed into a golf course . To shouts of " Fore ! " one might try to discover why such monuments were made there , how they were used , but it would n't be easy . The closest thing to ley lines we might be able to discern now are those airline-route maps found in your seat pocket ? the ambitious webbing of the planet , shortest distance between two points . Or more concretely , our interstate system , etchings  | of highways and cloverleafs cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new form of the power of intersection . Or perhaps the tradition is kept alive by contemporary earth artists who emulate megalithic monuments and Native American mounds by building large effigies , ramps , and geometric structures out in the western deserts . Sometimes these earthworks align with the stars ; sometimes they make patterns to view from the air . In part , they are meant to forge an aesthetic connection to pre-Columbian culture and to reassert the power of nature , and for those reasons they intrigue me . But in cases in which land is bulldozed , carved , and rearranged , these pieces also clearly mar the environments in which they 're built , which poses a dilemma . Robert Smithson , creator of the famous Spiral Jetty in Utah , boasted that for him the " disruption of the earth 's crust is compelling . " That sounds suspiciously like the architect of Mount Rushmore , Gutzon Borglum , who proclaimed that American achievements should be " built into , cut into , the crust of this earth . " If there are spirit lines here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but perhaps in something as subtle as the inadvertently beautiful patterns of plowed and planted fields . I like to think that even my garden making is an exercise in learning the secrets of this slice of earth , a way to keep my ear intelligently , respectfully to the ground . One summer morning , the shock of seeing the ground speak : I 'd wondered why a small triangular corner of the flower bed behind the house was flourishing while the rest of the bed was barren . It 's a long strip of land ripped up when the house needed repairs , and rather than reseed it with grass , I 'd naively strewn seeds at it from a package I picked up at the drugstore called Instant English Meadow , pictured as a wonderfully ragged collection of wildflowers , a patch of pure countryside , importable . All I got was mud . Except for the one corner , which  | was struggling into flower . Why ? Not until I was up before dawn one morning , sitting out back with the first birds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rising nearly in the northeast , was angling its way around the north wall of the house for the first half hour or so of its ascent , casting a bright triangle of light on the usually shaded bed , corresponding exactly to the budding corner of the English meadow . At work in the garden , I 've learned to look more closely and to listen for the voices of the Seneca , who once farmed this same piece of land , to come a step closer to penetrating the place 's silences . ? When to plant : When the first oak leaves of spring are as big as a red squirrel 's foot . ? Plant peas during a full moon , corn three days before one . ? Plant nothing when the east wind is blowing . Listening , I feel close in spirit , though not in efficiency , to the women who farmed here . They would go out with their babies on their backs , toddlers scampering beside them , while the men , never much involved in Iroquois agriculture , hunted . Today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and baby Clea is babbling from the edge in her stroller . When I stoop to pull a row of knee-high weeds , Zoe shrieks to stop me from destroying some Queen Anne 's lace . " It 's so beautiful , why are you pulling it out ? " I earnestly explain how our beans wo n't grow if they 're choked by weeds , how we ca n't even see them to harvest at the moment . " But this is n't a weed , it 's a flower . What 's a weed ? " That 's a larger question than I can manage just now . " You like this flower , do n't you ? " " Yes , I want to keep it . Look ! It has seeds sprinkling out . I 'm going to plant them so it will grow again . Not in the garden , Mama , but right over here near the garden so we can look at it while we 're picking beans , okay ? "  | Sure . We strike a deal . Momentarily excited by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I return to my sacrilege weeding , but soon she 's in need of another way to help . " What can I do now ? I want to plant more . " I stand up , try to imagine Seneca children tossing corn seeds around a field , and decide to risk sowing chaos . I hand her a package of red-leaf lettuce seeds and hover , trying not to restrict , though the instructions on the packet unnerve me . I watch her fling the seeds down in piles . I wish them luck and turn away . When they come up a couple of weeks later in dense bunches , I let her thin them by fistfuls , leaving big gaps between the coppery clumps , and , teeth gritted , decide we 'll manage with whatever late-summer lettuce survives her learning . To be a greedy gardener seems somehow offensive . What I get from the garden I like to regard as a gift . Nature and I have cooperated . Though when we have summers of drought , then summers when it rains daily for six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry , cheated . Who 's cooperating here ? This is my garden ! Not my chief source of food , it 's true , but the food I most covet and hoard in the deep freeze for the worst of winter nights , an essential ingredient of the life we 've made for ourselves here . ( Thirty plastic sacks of frozen green beans last summer , why only eighteen this year ? ) I have no gods to explain the failures of the weather , no fertility goddess to cede possession of my garden to . I 've found no ley lines , made no magic circles . I may have begun to feel centered here at last , I may pay my rent promptly , but what in the end does that entitle me to ? For the Iroquois , entitlement to the land was unfraught by anxieties like mine . An individual never owned land  --  a nation did  --  and decisions on its use were made by the group . The constitution of the Iroquois League declares , " The soil of the earth from one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property of the people who inhabit it . " The Iroquois understood that inhabitation changed , too  --  if a tribe moved from an area , its  | claim on it ceased , and another tribe could then take it up . Furthermore , as Onondaga faithkeeper Oren Lyons puts it , " Land does n't belong to the nation as much as it belongs to the future , " a principle that makes people see themselves as caretakers , accountable " unto the seventh generation " to follow . Such a viewpoint helps us understand the outrage caused by the selling or ceding of land to the colonists . " Father ! " Cornplanter cried to George Washington , You have compelled us to do that which has made us ashamed . We have nothing to answer to the children of the brothers of our fathers . . . . For they ask continually : " Where is the Land which our children , and their children after them are to lie upon ? " Among the Seneca , the treaties giving up land provoked such fury that prophet Handsome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , made the selling of land a cardinal sin . He consigned Red Jacket , key negotiator for the disastrous Fort Stanwix Treaty , to " a special hell in which he would be forced to carry dirt in a wheelbarrow for eternity . " A Dantesque sentence ! Just as Europeans were bewildered by Chinese geomancy , so they had no understanding of the Native American vision of the land they happened on . They thought of the newly discovered continent as virgin , as wilderness , not recognizing its fertility as the outcome of centuries of ecological management . Says Lisa Aug : " The unequaled monument of the pre-Columbian American civilization was one European settlers could neither see nor understand : a carefully maintained environment capable of sustaining itself and future generations indefinitely . " To fail to recognize that made it easier to claim a supposedly unclaimed land . Says Christopher Vecsey : " The virgin land rhetoric may have been more of a ploy by whites to take land occupied and developed by millennia of Indians , than a description of actual  | conditions . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleric who declared it a sin for women to drive also ruled that the earth is flat . ) One might say , as Aug does , that " more than bullets , more than disease , what destroyed the self-sustaining , ecologically sound Native American civilization was the European attack on the land itself . " Remember Sullivan and his " warfare against vegetables " ? Beginning in colonial New England , the new Americans vigorously assaulted forests , animals , and the soil itself , abandoning it when it failed them . They indifferently erected dams for mills that disrupted the spawning patterns of fish the Indians depended upon . Beavers were all but wiped out for the sake of fur hats , but by then silk hats had become the fashion in Europe anyway . Later , the extermination of the buffalo ? over three and a half million killed between 1872 and 1874 alone , just for their hides , meat left to rot on the ground ? ensured the destruction of the Plains Indians . The Indians , in contrast , conserved plants and animals by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians had close to a hundred uses for each buffalo they killed  --  for food , clothing , tepees , bedding , fuel , tools , shields , boats , coffins , bowstrings , glue , spoons , paint , hair grease , needles , decorative and religious objects . In the Northeast , deadwood was burned rather than live trees cut down , and fields periodically lay fallow so that used land was allowed to restore itself . Native American scholar John Mohawk says : The real historical Indian was far , far more capable and in lots of ways applied a lot more energy and intelligence to managing the environment than people imagine that he did . He spent a lot of time studying how the water interacted with the land and how the weather worked and how everything came together and which plants grew . He gave incredible  | attention to detail . The average Indian in the fifteenth or sixteenth century in the northeast probably knew more about the local botany than your professional botanist today , and he probably had a much wider variety of stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two hundred medicinal herbs were well known . And plants were described in breathtaking detail : the Tewa , for instance , are said to have forty names for different parts of each leaf . Oren Lyons asserts : " Indians have another reality , and we have a lot of experience with that reality . Comes from being in one place for 15,000 years , and working with it , celebrating it , teaching the next generation . " Nature was above all viewed as kin . The rain was called Grandfather , the sun Uncle . Lyons says that if the rain is acid and the sun gives you skin cancer , it 's as if your family has turned on you . Before , everyone got along . Animals and human beings were kin too ; in many Seneca myths they were seen as identical , only becoming outwardly distinguished over time . Thus , the hunter empathized with his victim 's suffering . Apology and thanksgiving accompanied all hunting : I am very sorry I had to kill thee , little brother , but I had need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for food . Forgive me , little brother . I honor thy courage , thy strength , and thy beauty . Each time I pass this place I will remember thee and do honor to thy spirit . Forgive me , little brother . See , I smoke to thy memory . Each time I pass this place I will remember . . . because I have stayed . The site of road kills , ditched woodchucks and skunks , the midroad splattered wingspan of a hawk  --  a record known and remembered . Where a sun-reddened buck once stood amid the young corn , hugely antlered , his silhouette pos-  |p1S4  sessing the skyline there forever after  --  places marked on the map I carry behind my eyes now , a new cartography that resists the forgetfulness I was reared on . Each time I pass . . . Sprawled across the right lane , her long blond hair flung out from her shoulder . I slam on the brakes , skid to a halt . I recognize her as a neighbor . She has gotten up , staggered toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she slips , crumples . I rush from the car , leave Clea crying in her car seat , cradle the woman 's bloodied head in my hands , tell her to hold on , I 'll get an ambulance , please hold on  --  and then the dream is broken by Clea 's real morning cry from the crib . I stumble from bed and stagger across the hall . Driving past there again , no blood on the road , no sign of disturbance . Instead , the tiger lilies have opened  --  marvelous flung gestures of orange , open eared for my lamentation and gratitude . Because I 've stayed , the land feels attentive , full of reciprocal energy . The Iroquois call that energy in nature orenda  --  a power inhabiting all living things , sometimes described as a kind of voltage or static electricity that can be accumulated through ritual and then used . It touches all things equally . Clea making her morning round of greetings , burbling " Hi " to us , to Zoe , the dog , her toys , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world , and if they 're Western , they correct it ; Native American children 's conception grows stronger the farther from white influence they are raised . In town , a video arcade  --  the largest game displays a pristine Adirondack landscape , a forest-circled bright blue lake and cloudless sky with blips of deer fleeing through the trees ; opposite sits a child armed with a computerized gun . It 's called Shoot Away . It is the association of the Indians with nature that may best explain their destruction  --  they were simply treated the way  | Europeans treated the land and its wildlife , as something that could be casually abused . Not surprisingly , the rationale for usurping Indian land was that whites believed they could better utilize it  --  occupy it more densely , cultivate it more intensely , build upon it more enduringly . Peter Thomas explains that " In the minds of European immigrants , their Old World agrarian pattern with its diverse crops and domestic animals was so superior to native American horticultural practices that propagandists and colonists alike used the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was maintained that the Indians had simply not improved ' the land . " The Indians ' seasonal shifts of settlement , and their dependence on hunting rather than domestic herds , placed them on a lower rung of agricultural development as far as Europeans were concerned . Although ethnographers have shown that in fact both colonists and Native Americans used comparable amounts of cultivated land to support a small village , the " land utilization " argument became conventional wisdom among the colonists . " These people must die out , " editorialized Horace Greeley , " there is no help for them . God has given this earth to those who will subdue and cultivate it , and it is vain to struggle against His righteous decree . " Behind this kind of self-justification lay the obvious immigrant tenor of the so-called wilderness and hatred of its inhabitants and their ways . As Vecsey describes it , the Puritans believed that the religion of the Indians " affirmed the satanic quality of the wilderness , just as the devilish quality of wilderness proved the evil of Indians . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countryside rather than the vil-lage ) , heathens ( of wild , uninhabited places ) , and savages ( of the forest )  - -  all of which endorses the view of nature as that which is irreligious , unable to be civilized . In the Western tradition , to be civilized is to rise above nature , to protect yourself from it and use it . Such an antagonistic stance inevitably led to both  | environmental destruction and racism , " especially toward people who were seen as nature folk , whose religions recognized and valued relations with nature . " The same association between land and women has also had disastrous implications in Western hands . According to Carolyn Merchant , when the image of earth as mother still abided in Europe , it " carried with it subtle ethical controls and re-straints " ? " One does not readily slay a mother , dig into her entrails for gold or mutilate her body , although commercial mining would soon require that . As long as the earth was considered to be alive and sensitive , it could be considered a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against it . " But with the decline of the matriarchy , with nature seen as generically female and culture as male , the land was forced to be as submissive as women were . Nature 's association with the female justified viewing it as inferior . The scientific revolution did away with any remaining restraints by depersonifying nature into " natural resources , " a term that , significantly , appeared around 1500 , concurrent with the European discovery of the New World . The disenchantment and degodding of the natural world into a mechanical , secular planet was a necessary prerequisite for the development of science and industrialization . Just as conquering a people requires destroying their landscape  --  their literal land or their pattern on it  --  scientific progress required destroying the old predominant worldview of nature . The vigorous European advance into the American continent carried a similar revolution of values . Says Lisa Aug : " Not only did Europeans harbor the incredible notion that land could be owned , paid for with lifeless bits of metal or paper , but they treated it with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The European 's apparent hatred of all other living things was so utterly foreign to people for whom the  | earth was the source of all life , that communication on the subject seemed impossible . " We know the sap which courses through the trees as we know the blood that courses through our veins . We are part of the earth and it is part of us . The perfumed flowers are our sisters . The bear , the deer , the great eagle , these are our brothers . The rocky crests , the juices in the meadow , the body heat of the pony , and man , all belong to the same family ... . When I first read that passage , attributed to Chief Seattle , I was lyrically aroused . The metaphor of family aptly evokes a dutiful , emotional tie to the natural world , which I aspire to . But having discovered that those words derive from a 1971 TV film on ecology  --  meant to capture the Native American spirit  --  I know how much of my own longing I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past twenty years have looked to the Indians ( out of both despair and guilt ) for a model by which to live in nature . Chief Seattle 's fictional letter to President Millard Filmore is now a standard text of environmental consciousness and as such articulates an idealistic solution to the problems we are preoccupied with . But it is too easy to make a cliche of Native American culture , to use some watered-down version of its ideas for our own current crises . Indian cultures themselves are various and distinct ; they do n't share a single vision of the earth but are very much products of particular locales . It is in those local distinctions that we can learn a great deal about how to live in our own places .  | EVERYWHERE I GO now I see things no one else does . Ghosts on the road , secret signs . I am like Freud 's hysteric , populating the landscape with a visible , beckoning past , searching for what ca n't show itself plain . One eye on the road , one eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the now and then , and feel surprisingly at home  --  at home in what 's both here and not here anymore . Without enough time to walk and muse much , except in the summers , I 've learned how to contemplate while driving . Though protectively encased as I cover tens of miles , I am feelingly in the landscape . I notice and know because I 've worked to make this my place . I introduce Zoe , commuting with me to a kindergarten in Geneva instead of going to the armybase district out here . We stop to visit some newborn colts , notice the wind shifting south , a softening , shy breeze . The wind of the fawn in Seneca lore , Zoe remembers me telling her . The road we daily commute , Routes 5 &; zo , is no mere four-lane highway where heat sways or snow sifts in bannered gusts . It is , for me now , palpably the longhouse line , macadamless , an idea stretching midair , but also earthbound and practi-cal  --  the Iroquois ' admirable capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their astuteness about this land seems to have been as honed as the Chinese 's . Here is a route so judiciously chosen that even sophisticated surveys have found no better location for a cross-state road . It is , as Morgan asserted , " one of the great natural highways of the continent . " It even divides the weather , " north of the Thruway " being a  | familiar phrase of weather forecasts : while lake-effect snow routinely pummels the area just south of Lake Ontario , snowfall invariably diminishes right around the New York Thruway , making it more reliably passable , as the Iroquois no doubt observed . The current Thruway , along with Route 20 , mirrors the longhouse line almost exactly ; it salutes the Iroquois only in the names of its service areas  --  which house not hearths but Burger Kings . Nearly all major upstate cities and towns lie shoulder to shoulder along this old alignment . As I drive farther out into the land , I discover more of the tales that have housed themselves here . I circle the lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , journey to places where I 've learned others have come and paused to dwell , then try to reconstruct them and map the landscape with their presence , discern a pattern . The most evident form of spiritual energy I 'm likely to find in this land is in the lives of its people , past and present . Two miles south of our first house , I find a woman standing by the western edge of Seneca Lake surrounded by a crowd , waves lapping the toes of her black boots and the hem of her long cape . A question seems to hover in the air : Can she walk on water ? " Do ye have faith ? " she exhorts . " Do ye believe that I can do this thing ? " She 's never failed to stir a crowd . " Do ye have faith ? " she demands again . " We believe , " they chorus , " we believe . " " Good , " she declares , and coolly turns to depart the shore . " If ye have faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilkinson , known to her followers as the Publick Universal Friend , and this apocryphal event takes place in the late eighteenth century at the site of Dresden , about twelve miles south of Geneva . Jemima Wilkinson is the least well known of the important religious innovators of that period . Unlike Ann Lee of the Shakers and John Murray , founder of Universalism , she was American-born , the first American-born woman to found a  | religious society . Like Ann Lee , she was originally Quaker , emphasized celibacy , equality of men and women and of black and white . She preached old-fashioned moral values and the coming of the millennium . She had predicted the new millennium would arrive in early April 1780 . That April passed uneventfully , but several weeks later , southern New England , the early center of her ministry , experienced the so-called Dark Day ? " For several days before the mysterious event the atmosphere was smoky , but on the nineteenth of May , 178o , at about ten in the morning , the sun was blotted out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not an eclipse of the sun . Combined with a smoky smell and copper red or yellow clouds , it lasted until about two o'clock in the afternoon and was a terrifying experience .... Wilkinson 's prediction , to some , seemed fulfilled . As a young woman of twenty-four in Cumberland , Rhode Island , she had suffered a hallucinatory fever . Upon recovering , she claimed to have actually died , been inhabited by a new spirit , and immediately began to preach the visions she 'd seen . Though she had n't appeared to have died to those attending her , the story nevertheless developed that she had lain in a deathlike trance for hours , or even days . On rising , she refused to answer to her name but henceforth called herself the Publick Universal Friend , believing her new identity and mission to have been sent by God . Whatever its origin , her sense of mission gave her , by all accounts , striking self-confidence , eloquence , and determination . She was said to have an extraordinary memory  --  she could neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from hearing it read to her . Though completely inexperienced in public life , she was soon preaching in crowded churches before local farmers , and soon after to the wealthy , to scholars , and to Indians . Her theological ideas were unoriginal , but her presence was emotionally compelling : " She preaches up Terror very alarming . "   About ten years into her ministry she began to plan a community dwelling , a " wilderness sanctuary . " Scouts were sent to explore the Genesee Country in 1785 . First reports were enthusiastic . But a second scout was so bogged down in snow that it took him five days to wade from Elmira to Geneva . He warned of the hostility of the few Indians who 'd returned post-Sullivan , which made it " too soon to enter the sad , dark , land of the lakes . " Nevertheless , a group set out to pick a site and resolved that it be on Seneca Lake ( despite the more favorable impression one scout had of the Genesee River , where he 'd met Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first group settled near Dresden , the site of the Keuka outlet into Seneca Lake , where a waterfall provided the possibility of a mill . Despite uncertainties about title , the community cleared the land and stayed , thus becoming the first group of settlers to winter west of Cayuga Lake , the first whites to farm here . They built the first mill and helped feed new settlers brought in by Charles Williamson . Wilkinson herself arrived in 1790 , at which time her community contained z6o people , by far the largest settlement in western New York , two and a half times the size of Geneva . For her role in helping new farmers get started , preventing the famines that took place elsewhere , she has been called the patron saint of early white agriculture in western New York . She was also respected and treated generously by the remaining Indians . When six hundred Iroquois passed through on their way to Canandaigua to negotiate the Pickering Treaty , they camped on her land and listened to her preach . She followed them up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was doomed , though , by title complications and the escalating value of the land as it was tossed back and forth between speculators . Wilkinson 's group was finally driven west of the Preemption line to site its New Jerusalem , this time by Keuka Lake . There they settled in a  | township near Penn Yan that is still today called Jerusalem . But as the years passed , the group 's unity and reputation staggered under defections ( the birth of a child was plain evidence of disobedience ) and gossip about Wilkinson 's financial dealings and alleged manipulation of her followers . Even as it lost its spiritual cohesion , however , the community remained a colorful oddity to outsiders , a tourist attraction described as " the second wonder of the western country , " an obligatory detour for those on the grand tour to Niagara Falls . When the Universal Friend died , or " left time , " as she preferred to call it , her body was taken by night to a secret grave , as she 'd requested . Only the descendants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are said to know the grave 's location . A mystique continues to surround her ; her surviving effects  --  a gilded saddle and carriage , a beaver hat and black cape  --  are on display in a small museum in Penn Yan . At the opposite end of Keuka Lake , a contemporary eccentric draws away my attention . " They took my name and heritage but they did n't get my goat . " A portrait of the goat smiles from the elaborate label of a wine bottle  --  its name is Guilt Free . The label is signed Walter S. , Baron of Bully Hill , King of the Goats  --  the blanked-out last name looking like the smudge of a censor 's stamp . And therein lies the story . It 's been a crime for Walter Taylor to print his name on a bottle of wine since the Taylor Wine Company was bought by Coca-Cola in the mid-seventies . The drama began before that when , at a wine makers ' conference in San Francisco in 1970 , Walter Taylor denounced New York State wineries for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheap California or imported wines  --  low-grade " tank car " wines . Styling himself as the " conscience of the wine industry , " Taylor protested that the executives of the big companies that had taken over the family wineries did n't care about wine quality or about the vineyards  --  they " did n't want to be in touch with the  | plants . " Walter Taylor and his father had been very much in touch with them , experimenting through the sixties with grafts of French varieties at Bully Hill , the original Taylor family vineyard , founded in 1878 and passed on through five generations . The new hybrids , Taylor claimed , made it unnecessary to cut the harsher flavor of the New York labrusca grapes  --  the only type previously thought suitable for New York 's cooler weather . The hybrids created European-quality wines . Two weeks after the San Francisco speech , suddenly accused of misusing company funds , Walter Taylor was fired by the Taylor Wine Company . Starting over at the family vineyard , he hired purists to create the new Bully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " universally used " chemical additives instead of the sixty allowed by state law . He listed all ingredients on his labels , even the names of the local grape growers ( " I 'm a freedom fighter against anonymity " ) . Fighting his own anonymity , he slung a guitar over his shoulder and went on the road to promote his new wine . It took off . The Taylor Company ignored him until he began bragging about how his wine was the original , real Taylor , and then they successfully sued him for copyright infringement and unfair competition . Taylor had to remove his name from his wine labels ; he could n't even sign his own paintings that adorned them . " They have stolen my birthright , " he proclaimed on the courthouse steps . But he quickly capitalized on the affront . He handed out Magic Markers to his staff and a bunch of eager customers and had them black out the word " Taylor " wherever it occurred on his bottles of wine . The deleted name became the trademark he still uses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coca-Cola Company was not amused . They sued again , and Walter Taylor was found in contempt of court . His reputation was by now made  --  a David battling the corporate Goliath . Courting the press , he used each new legal setback to his own advantage , and business boomed  --  sales of Bully Hill  | wine rose from $650,000 to $2 million during the two-year court battle . Walter Taylor inspired a new generation of small vineyard owners to begin making their own wines instead of selling their grapes to the Taylor conglomerate . These small independents have been dubbed the " Upstate Upstarts " by the wine industry , but because of them New York State wine sales have doubled in the past fifteen years . Until an accident in 1990 left him paralyzed , Taylor was a great showman whom tourists flocked to see at his vineyard wine tastings . He 's explicitly spiritual about his work : " A product is an extension of a person 's soul . " And he has a vividly paranoid imagination , claiming there are hidden submarine routes beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountaintops . His life firmly embedded in the local landscape , he distributes maps of the area marking the sites of his personal mythology  --  like the cave where he says he was rescued from Coca-Cola by guilt-free goats  --  as well as spots like Nightmare Alley near Hammondsport : " Possible view of unloading railroad wine tank cars and liquid corn syrup ( cheap , adulterated and not taxed ) . Bring your camera . " Taylor is , to my mind , a direct descendant of Jemima Wilkinson in his reformational passion , and between the two of them is to be found a long line of nineteenth-century revivalists , utopians , and spiritualists , including , most memorably , Joseph Smith standing with his Book of Mormon atop a hill in Palmyra , just west of Geneva down the longhouse line . What is it in Bully Hill and the hills of Palmyra that sets people preaching , remaking their neighbors ? " Something about the land , " muses Paul Horgan , " induces people to arise and prophesy and cock their ears toward the invisible powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come watch it . Every summer  | they come to Palmyra to see a cast of six hundred lavishly costumed volunteers , twenty-five multilevel stages , " grand illusions and special effects including ethereal water curtains , " explosions , real fire , lasers , and , of course , a digital sound track by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir . " The music rises dramatically . Spotlights search for the star of the show  --  and find him suspended in mid-air fifty feet above the stage . " It is America 's oldest and most elaborate religious spectacle , the Hill Cumorah Pageant , the Mormons ' annual outdoor staging of the tales of the Book of Mormon and Smith 's discovery of their source , the golden tablets , on that very hill , culminating with the descent of Christ into the crowd . For more than fifty years , tens of thousands have gathered in the summer dusk to be moved to or confirmed in faith . " We 're trying to reach audiences used to rock concerts , spectacular light shows and sixty-minute television programs , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty-five-year-old non-Mormons . We want those people to get the message that the events portrayed on this hillside actually did happen . " The special-effects coordinator of the show is a veteran of Robocop and Rambo III . What must we do to be saved ? Blond Mormon youth stay in the uncharacteristically tame college dorms for two weeks each summer . The boys wear ties to dinner , unprecedented on campus except during pledge season . I still have trouble placing them here . But the pattern is becoming clear . As Whitney Cross , author of The Burned-Over District , describes it , " Across the rolling hills of western New York and along the line of De Witt Clinton 's famed canal , there stretched in the second quarter of the nineteenth century a psychic highway . ' Upon this broad belt of land congregated a people extraordinarily given to unusual religious beliefs , particularly devoted to crusades aimed at the perfection of mankind and the attainment of millennial happiness . " Today 's devotees have been drawn back down the well-  | known canal / highway / @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ map the more I learn . The line was , of course , the literal turnpike west for migrating New Englanders ; it could become a psychic highway only because this area was historically a funnel through which thousands of westbound emigrants passed . It was because of them and their spiritual fervor that central New York was dubbed " The Burned-Over District , " not for any recollection of the scorchings of Sullivan . The area 's rapid growth , and a continuing stream of rebellious , often skeptical emigrants , fueled social and spiritual upheavals , spawned numerous religious communities , and made the careers of more than a few evangelists . Alongside the Shakers , the Publick Universal Friend , and Joseph Smith , there were the Millerites , who left their crops unharvested the summer of 1844 awaiting the end of the world , and there was itinerant preacher Charles Finney , the nation 's first professional evangelist , who fomented self-redemptive revivals in village churches all over upstate New York . There was John Humphrey Noyes 's utopian Oneida Community , a thriving experiment in socialism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oddities like the seancing Fox sisters and the agnostic Robert G. Ingersoll , born , ironically , in Wilkinson 's Dresden , a notable proselytizer on such subjects as " Some Mistakes of Moses . " The people these preachers and reformers worked among were argumentative and extremist . Their radicalism extended to secular matters too  --  they were dedicated fighters for abolition , temperance , and , later , feminism . Women were an important element of all the area 's movements . Unlike in New England , here women frequently preached and composed the majorities of the churches ; they dominated revivals and prayer meetings , perhaps helping to pave the way for the women 's movement . It was in Seneca Falls , ten miles east of Geneva on the longhouse line , that Elizabeth Cady Stanton lived , wrote , and organized the first women 's rights  | convention in 1848 . Amelia Bloomer invented the liberating pants that bear her name on a sewing machine on South Main Street in Geneva . Susan B. Anthony , Frederick Douglass , and Lewis Henry Morgan were all contemporaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader , the scholarly and charismatic Matilda Joslyn Gage , lived in Fayetteville , just south of Syracuse . Resisting the area 's intense religiosity , Gage was fiercely opposed to the Church , counting it as one element of women 's " four-fold bondage " along with the state , capitalism , and the home . Women 's suffrage was , to her mind , but a first step in a long revolution . Unfortunately , Matilda Gage was largely written out of the history of the women 's movement because of Susan Anthony 's conservative turn in 1889 , when she overthrew Gage 's leadership and suppressed her threatening politics for the sake of an alliance with the temperance movement . Now that Gage 's work has come to light , it 's interesting to discover that she was one of the few in the movement who also turned her attention and pen to the plight of the Iroquois . For her efforts , she was made an honorary member of their Council of Matrons . She also wrote frequently about the matriarchy and goddess worship , which she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hundred years before being taken up again by contemporary feminists . This area 's passion for new religious and political ideas earned Syracuse the nickname " the City of Isms , " so frequent were the conventions of abolitionists and other reformers . New " sciences , " like phrenology , flourished . The populace was innovative in the practical realm , too  --  patent records show that inventors worked with unusual concentration along this same midstate line , most notably creating a great variety of agricultural equipment . Their earlier , unequaled zeal for classical placenames is seen by Wilbur Zelinsky as the beginning of a pattern in which the area was a testing ground for " exotica " ? " When  | the cultural geography of this area receives the attention it deserves , it will be found to have spawned a number of other significant American innovations , " innovations that represent " the extroverted buoyancy and expansiveness of spirit that many observers identify as American . " Zelinsky 's assertion that this area has been important in forming the nation 's character affirms my own fascination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own thinking feels somewhat at home here  --  in some of those " isms , " there are strands of tradition I can attach myself to . Curiously , though , most of those revolutionary nineteenthcentury New Yorkers did not see themselves as adventurous radicals ( and " radical " is the last word they 'd use to describe themselves today ) . They were mostly middle-class , middle-aged people whose moderate success , perhaps , caused them guilt and anxiety . Their inclination toward self-improvement , though , made this area the stage for the most intense religiosity in the country 's history . Instead of " burned , " some called it " the infected district . " But New Yorkers regarded the burned-over epithet proudly . They considered their moral intensity their most admirable quality . The family of Joseph Smith was typical . Poor farmers , slightly educated , interested in the supernatural , they had emigrated from Vermont to western New York in 1816 , when Joseph was ten years old , after an infamously frigid , crop-withering summer dubbed " eighteen hundred and froze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than vigorous  --  he preferred to daydream . Neighbors remembered young Smith , too , as a loafer and " money digger , " a supposed diviner who used a " peeping stone " to sight and dig for treasure . Smith claimed he was guided to his greatest find  --  the revelatory golden plates  --  by an angel . The Book of Mormon is said to derive from the history provided on the plates , though it also clearly partakes of local legends about the Mound Builders , whom Smith portrays as Hebrew descend-  | ants , and contemporary religious and political controversies , especially anti-Masonry . Whitney Cross claims that Smith 's ascension as prophet " might have happened to almost anyone of Joseph 's fellow Yankee migrants . " Thomas O'Dea , too , says it was " accepted and expected " in the area that new religious groups would arise " based upon novel claims . " Mormonism can be seen then , says Cross , as " the first original product of the common circumstances which would breed a train of successors . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Fox sisters of Newark ( neighbor of Palmyra ) had captured the loyalties of thousands with their table-rapping seances . Rather than being regarded as eccentric occultism , their noisy sessions fit well the prevailing religious fervor . Enthusiasm for the manipulated young sisters spread so far that even Emerson felt compelled to rail against the " rat-revelation , the gospel that comes by taps in the walls , and thumps in the table-drawer . " And as far as Thoreau was concerned , " The hooting of owls , the croaking of frogs , is celestial wisdom in comparison . " The enthusiastic still flock to Hill Cumorah  --  for a cinematic version of the sacred in this culturally burned-out district . I 'd almost welcome a return to the reformational passions of that lost era , some sign of life , which in its more serious manifestations showed genuine nonconformity and utopian idealism . Little of all that is fondly remembered here . The early women 's movement is commemorated in ambivalent Seneca Falls by a triangular slice of park smaller than our front lawn . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Walter Taylor 's religion of the pure grape , or the utopian farming and craft-making commune of the Rochester Folk Art Guild , located near Bare Hill , or in the growing numbers of Mennonites settling here . Though one can explain the emigration of the Mennonites from the Lancaster , Pennsylvania , area by the overcrowding and  | rising costs there , and by the cheap land available here as local farms fail , I suspect this region is attractive to them for more reasons than that . They must know something of its history , its literal and spiritual fertility , its likely tolerance of their unconventionality . After some initial jitters , the community has indeed been hospitable . Penn Yan has even built a special parking lot downtown beside the drive-in bank with hitching posts for their horses and buggies . Deer-warning and cow-warning signs on the highway have been joined by silhouettes of carriages . Mennonites began coming to the area in 1914 . Within ten years , there were eighty families around Penn Yan , and now a new cluster of farms has spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the land to work in produce shops in town , bringing fresh bread and pies to sell . Out at the roadside stands by their farms , the barely educated girls often have trouble making change , but in town they operate cash registers , wear sneakers beneath their traditional dresses . Contact with the outside world has modified them , but the conservative structure and rigor of their community remain . Whether they work in town , in the fields , or in the kitchen , they work relentlessly , at all hours . Mennonite farmer John Wagner called us at five in the morning . David picked up the phone and repeated to me , " Rhode Island Reds or bantams ? " It sounded like a nonsense refrain in the zany dream I was in the middle of . I replied , " Rhode Island Reds or bantams . " " Pick one , " he said . We 'd gone to visit the large Wagner farm the week before to look into buying some chickens . The Mennonites raise them naturally , of course , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wanted to avoid the hormones in commercial meat . The Wagners slaughtered their older hens each spring and would sell us fifty at a good price ; we had found someone to split the bounty with . Wagner said he 'd call the day of the butchering.  | The phone rang again at six . Did we want them dressed ? Dressed up ? No , plucked and cleaned . Definitely . " That will be twenty-five cents extra per chicken . " That 's all ? " That 's fine . " " You can come get them this evening . " Five daughters working for hours for twenty-five cents times fifty chickens . Gathered round the table in the oil-lamp-lit kitchen that night , a nineteenth-century softness , their heads bent over bowls of chicken livers , bowls of hearts , the fifty shining birds . They 'd asked us to bring plastic bags , and now they set about packing everything up for us . Shy and gentle faced , they peeked at me and my obvious belly , flashed a timid smile . They 'd been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other chores had been done too . A quilt was spread on a table , half-made . Bread and pies were stacked for the morning . Laundry was soaking in a basin , the cows had been milked , cream was rising in a pail . Not since Ireland had I seen so much work going on , and the memory of it in my own hands warmed me , though the distance I 'd come from it in ten years was jarring  --  loading the bagged chickens into the car , driving them back to the deep freeze , back to washing machine , word processor , and take-out dinner . I was glad , at least , to have those honest chickens to cook , though whichever breed it was I picked that morning , I must have picked wrong  --  the meat was hopelessly tough , only edible when boiled hours into soup . Perhaps in their quiet way , the Mennonites have picked up the thread of this region 's religious character , made and remade in waves of influence and experimentation aimed at ultimate simplicities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volleyball of an afternoon , flowered dresses brushing the grasses , is to be stopped in one 's tracks a moment , thoughtfully cast back . ' Whether or not they influence our spiritual lives , they certainly provide a wholesome model of agriculture . While modern farms are failing all over the state , the unmechanized farms of the Mennonites are flourishing . The number of New York dairy  | farms dropped by twenty-five percent during the eighties ; but in Mennonite-settled Yates County , the number doubled . The state advises failing dairy farmers to convert to such products as snow peas and kiwi fruit for the upscale market  --  an idea as disconcerting as the llama ranches that have cropped up among horse farms between here and Canandaigua . Those long , shaggy necks , glimpsed from 5 &; 20 , turn the land into zoo . The Mennonite farms , in contrast , feel indigenous . Officially , the enduring contributions of the burned-over era are the Mormon church , several Adventist denominations , two species of Methodism , and a sprinkling of spiritualist groups . Enduring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of this terri-tory 's unusual energies . Enough traces of sanctity remain that even those usually indifferent to such matters have had to pay heed . When state officials put together a proposal to site the planned super collider up in Wayne County , north of the Thruway , they discovered that the fifty-three-mile circular tunnel would go right under Hill Cumorah . They knew enough not to suggest that , but then the next version had the tunnel going through the Sacred Grove , where Joseph Smith claimed to be visited by God and Christ in 1820 . After a brief attempt to pass that off , the planners moved on again . " We have been dodging and weaving like a football halfback ... bumping off Indian reservations and sacred hills .... " The tunnel was in the end awarded to Texas , and the national commission 's report noted that more letters of protest about the project had come from Wayne County , New York , than from any other proposed site . The land has recently won out over development elsewhere too  --  at Bare Hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought by the Trust for Public Land , which will hold it until the appropriate public agency can get funding . It 's  | hoped the hilltop will eventually be used by the Department of Parks and Recreation to expand its Native American educational program begun at Ganondagan . Most intriguing to me in the saving of Bare Hill over the past couple of years has been the active role of non  --  Native Americans in the fight . Surprisingly , longtime Canandaiguans profess a spiritual connection to the hill not unlike the Seneca 's : " Bare Hill is one of those special places that nourish the spirit . " " There 's a certain energy up there , a power that deserved to be treated with more respect . We just felt it needed to be undis-turbed . " " A spirit . . . pervades the whole place and affects everybody who goes up there . " Their unity with the Seneca in their attachment to the hill has been a striking milestone in relations between the two cultures here . Hundreds of local people show up for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's a craft show , native corn soup and hash , buffalo meat , and the lively Allegany River Indian Dancers . They do dances of friendship , of the rabbit and the fish , and a dance for the passenger pigeon  --  though the bird is extinct , the dance , wonderfully , remains extant : chanted , foot stomped , drummed , belled . Close up , a whiff of mildew on the ceremonial robes of the dancers , taken out of storage for the occasion . " Yes , we eat pizza and play video games , but we also have this very rich culture . " Peter Jemison and his son join in . Children young as four . And octogenarian , local historian Sheldon Fisher is there . Fisher spent decades working to preserve Ganondagan , one of a touching series of men I 've discovered who 've devoted themselves to the study and protection of the Iroquois . I ca n't help but think back fondly to those scholars and activists at moments like this , watching Fisher watch this dance . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that Father of American Anthropology , who began as a boy enthusiast for the Cayuga tribe , which had inhabited the area around  | his Aurora home . He studied the Iroquois for more than ten years , chiefly on the Seneca 's Tonawanda reservation . The resulting book , The League of the Hodenosaunee , published in 1851 , remains the classic source of ethnographic information on the Iroquois . Morgan 's original interest in the Iroquois may have been merely to acquire authentic rites for his club , the Grand Order of the Iroquois , a group of young white men presumptuous enough to have imagined itself heir to the " dying " Iroquois League . The club itself died out within a decade . Morgan did unapologetically borrow elements from the ceremonies he 'd been privileged to observe . But he also , as a lawyer , lobbied on behalf of the Seneca when their reservations were threatened with reduction , and so earned their respect . He was adopted by the tribe and named Tayadaokuh  --  Bridge  --  a link between the cultures . Morgan was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Parker was just sixteen when Morgan took him under his wing and got him into a private school . Unable to become a lawyer as he wished , because he was n't a U.S. citizen , Parker instead became an engineer and ultimately a U.S. general and Ulysses Grant 's personal secretary ( he was present at Appomattox , having drafted the terms for Lee 's surrender ) . Later , he was the first Native American to be appointed commissioner of Indian Affairs . It was Parker who wrote the eloquent letter trying to protect the Ganundasaga burial mound . And it was Parker who took Morgan to Tonawanda , gained him entree to the tribe 's rituals , and explained what Morgan observed . Parker was as much a " bridge " as Morgan , a liminal figure who was vital in accomplishing the coherent translation of a huge body of knowledge . Indeed , Morgan dedicated his book to Parker , referring to their " joint researches . " Morgan moved on from his original research to study comparative kinship systems and to write three more books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has been called " the most catalytic book in the history of anthropology . " Karl Marx , deeply impressed by it , took extensive notes and planned to write about Morgan 's theories of family , government , and evolutionary " stages " of human progress . But he died before he could write the planned work , and it was Frederick Engels who took up what he thought of as a bequest and wrote The Origin of the Family , Private Property and the State in the Light of the Researches of Lewis H. Morgan . Engels claimed Morgan 's book was " one of the few epoch-making works of our time . " His " rediscovery of the primitive matriarchal gens as the earlier stage of the patriarchal gens of civilized people has the same import for anthropology as Darwin 's theory of evolution has for biology and Marx 's theory of surplus values has for political economy . " It was among the Iroquois that Morgan first got the idea . Maybe Matilda Gage got it from them too .. . Engels also marveled at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sachems ( chiefs ) selected by the women ( and they had the right to unseat a chosen chief ) , its requirement of unanimous consent in all decisions , its lack of a single leader , and its inability to convene itself except by the initiation of a member tribe  --  a perfect example , he said , of " a society which still has no state . " After spending his working life in Rochester , Morgan retired to his birthplace on the eastern shore of Cayuga Lake . There he was the talkative proprietor of the Aurora Inn . And it 's said ( though not in any biography ) that Longfellow once wandered in to stay the night . Late , over drinks , Longfellow asks  --  Are there any good stories from around here , Indian legends or epics ? So Morgan happily sits down and tells him the tale of the founding of the Iroquois League , the woe of Hiawatha , the condolence ritual , and so on . Presto ? " The Song of Hiawatha. "  | Should you ask me , whence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should tell you , From the forests and the prairies . . . I repeat them as I heard them From the lips of Nawadaha , The musician , the sweet singer . Actually , Longfellow sculpted the tale from Ojibwa myths , but for some reason chose the Iroquois name for his hero . Morgan 's work , important as it is , was preceded by the little-acknowledged research of a native Iroquois writer , Tuscarora David Cusick . Sketches of Ancient History of the Six Nations was published in 1827 , a generation before Morgan , and details the history , culture , and lore of the Iroquois from a native intimacy , but with admirable ethnographic skill . It 's unclear whether or not Morgan was aware of the book . Russell Judkins believes that , " This work , which clearly pre-dates the development of Euro-American anthropology , . . . has special significance as an intellectual endeavor , and as an anticipatory work contributing to  --  as well as being an early contribution of  --  Native American scholarship and anthropological perspective . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one might suspect that the Native American mind has had more to do with the invention and the development of anthropological understanding than Euro-American versions of intellectual history have generally been willing to see and to admit . " What a riveting idea  --  that Iroquois self-reflectiveness contributed to the evolution of ethnography . The role of Ely Parker , as well as of Cusick , clearly points to a remarkable degree of Iroquois self-awareness about their social , political , and religious organization . Judkins believes that Parker may have been the truly " catalytic " figure in Morgan 's work , the one with the initial insights , and Morgan a receptive  | transcriber able to organize what Parker told him into a theory . That same self-reflectiveness is exemplified by the career of Ely Parker 's grandnephew , Arthur Caswell Parker , who was a tireless archaeologist , interpreter of Iroquois culture , and longtime director of the Rochester Museum and Science Center . Half-Seneca , he moved easily between the two cultures , was admitted to secret ceremonies non-native writers were barred from , wrote numerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his two decades at the museum . He confessed that he was " vain enough to hope I will out-Morgan Morgan , " and on several topics he did . His study of maize and its uses was pioneering ; contemporary Iroquois specialist William Fenton claims it " set a standard for such studies and was used as a model for similar work on the Plains Indians and in the American southwest . " Sheldon Fisher speaks Arthur Parker 's name with awe . He proudly tells me that he studied archaeology with Parker from the time he was a boy  --  another boy , like Morgan , enamored of the tales in his native bailiwick . Fisher ultimately worked with Parker to help build the museum collection . Later , Fisher created his own museum , Valentown , a lovely old two-story wooden building just across the highway from the enormous , unlovely East View Mall . Funny enough , Valentown itself was originally a kind of mini-mall  --  a cobbler , a baker , and a miscellany of others housed under one roof , huddled expectantly where the railroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far , and the businesses failed . Fisher has on display hundreds of never-worn antique shoes from the shop , along with numerous Iroquois artifacts  --  jewelry , rattles , corn-husk dolls , a huge bark canoe perched amid piles of old tools  --  the whole place jammed with his excitements . Unorganized , untidy , it is an idiosyncratic one-man operation . Admission is $1.25 , but 25 cents extra at night  --  the cost of turning on the lights . Fisher personally  | escorts each guest nimbly up and down the long stairways like a man half his age . The day I visit him there , he wants to tell me everything he knows to help my search for the land 's stories . He boasts that he 's been to longhouse ceremonies , says he could tell me secrets . I say please do n't . He says he knows the burial site of Jikonhsaseh at Ganondagan  --  Arthur Parker showed it to him ; he says he 's shown it to Peter Jemison so someone will continue to know . Can this be true ? Halfway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ False Face masks over in his house  --  he took them off display out of respect for Seneca wishes because the masks are sacred , regarded as alive , are even traditionally fed porridge . Fisher , though , thinks his masks must be dead ; they have n't been back to council for so long . So he invites me to see them , and this I do n't turn down . His house is more cluttered than the museum , books and papers competing with Iroquois and colonial paraphernalia . He searches for an old cardboard box on the floor , newspapers crumpled inside , lifts out his own Seneca hat of turkey feathers , one eagle feather on top , pointing back , and then hauls out three breathtaking basswood masks . I hold them in my hands , meet face-to-face the fierce gritted teeth and puckered lips of the Wind Blower , stroke his horse-tail hair . Child of museums , I 'm used to seeing these two-dimensionally , high on walls , behind glass . Up close , there 's no doubt , they look live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads of dancers in the longhouse smoke is beyond my imagining . Honored for his primary role in the forty-two-year campaign that led to the dedication of Ganondagan , Sheldon Fisher was adopted by the Heron Clan of the Seneca , given the name of Hiawasees , the Eagle Who Gathers News and History . Today at Ganondagan , wearing his clan necklace , he stands back with pride gazing at his work  --  a dedicated space , its  | celebration . The corn-burning French and colonial Americans are gone ; so are the revivalists . Seneca music , fleetingly , is back . Coming to Ganondagan is , repeatedly , a vital act of reorientation for me , a respite . It is one of the few places here one can reliably feel the presence of the Seneca . I drive back through Canandaigua , pass its welcome sign emblazoned " The Chosen Place " ? its Seneca meaning become a tourist slogan . New plazas and townhouses are sprouting up amid loosestrife and goldenrod , Canandaigua become so overdeveloped you can barely glimpse the lake from town . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a new grant of land to expand Ganondagan , the saving of Bare Hill . The Seneca plan a ceremony to restore the spirit of the land atop Bare Hill . But apparently , in spite of litter and a lapse of more than a hundred years in ceremonies , the spirit of that place has in fact survived , and won converts . This area is the only place in the Northeast I 've felt the precariousness of the whole American enterprise . Out amid the rotting barns and wide-open fields , I sometimes feel it could all crumble in a minute . Tear down the electric poles , a few factories and stores , and we 're gone . Take a piece of lakeshore land near Kendaia , turn it into a navy boot camp , finish with it , give it to the air force for a while , and when they do n't need it anymore , throw up your hands , give it to the state , tear down the buildings , make it a park , call it Sampson , let it be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it becomes . . . part of the package being negotiated for the Cayuga land-claim settlement . Though it 's in traditional Seneca territory , it 's close to original Cayuga land , and a convenient place for the state to give up . Just a few miles down the road from where we 're living , the Cayuga might well be returning . What lies behind such a possibility ? The Cayuga , alone  | and Michael discounted heavily what he read . Not that he was fussy . He 'd stayed many nights in small Indian hotels where a hole in the floor worked as a toilet and the shower was cold , if there was a shower at all . After a few nights , however , he 'd forget there was any other way than cold showers and a hole in the floor , and it all worked just fine . A hot shower , in traditional south Indian terms , would justify the claim " Truly an Aristocratic Experience . " He concentrated on Jellie , thinking hard about her ways and what he knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Park Guest House was part of the ashram and had a Spartan attitude toward smoking , liquor , and human weaknesses in general . Jellie had come to think things over , according to her cable , and the guest house with its gardens , vegetarian restaurant , and meditative overtones spoke to that way of life . Initially Michael thought that finding Jellie , if she was in Pondicherry , would not be all that difficult . White skin stood out in most of India . But it was a much larger town than he 'd anticipated , and the guide stated many Westerners came to bathe in the rarefied spirit of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother . And , as Michael had already considered , it was easy to get lost in India if that 's what you wanted . India could present a silent , impenetrable face when it chose , leaving you on the outside with no view to the interiors . Jellie was an old India hand , apparently with good connections , and would know how to conceal herself if she made up her mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , India could be infuriating . Slow Waltz in Cedar Bend 137  | The driver decided lunch was in order at Madurantakam . He pulled over and went up to an outdoor food stand . Michael was n't hungry but drank a cup of tea and ate one of the Snickers he 'd bought in Heathrow . People gathered around him at a respectful distance and stared ; routine curiosity , nothing more . The sun was high and hard at noon . He clumped the old cotton hat on his head , fending off the kids who were less circumspect than their elders and wanted something , anything , from him . He bought some more oranges and handed them around , though the kids would have preferred something more wondrous , such as a cheap ballpoint pen from America . Sweat soaked through his shirt , ran down his chest and back . Michael was wiping his face and neck with a red bandanna when the driver signaled it was time to leave . Forty-five minutes later they made the turn at Tindivanam and headed southeast toward Pondicherry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road they 'd just left . This was semiarid land , palm trees arching over the road . People were spreading stalks of grain on the pavement , drying the grain , and letting vehicle wheels act as kind of a primitive threshing machine . Outskirts of Pondicherry . The map fastened in the back of the city guide indicated they were coming in on Jawaharlal Nehru Street , apparently one of the main thoroughfares . Michael decided against staying at the ashram 's guest house , mostly because he was n't sure how Jellie might feel if he suddenly showed up . If she saw him before he saw her , she might retreat  | with whatever secrets she carried and become impossible to find once she knew he was here looking for her . The Grand Hotel d'Europe at Number 12 Rue Suffren was in the same general area as most of the ashram 's workshops and not far from the guest house . It was run by an old Frenchman , a Monsieur Maigrit , according to the guide . Michael suspected the food would be continental , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down pretty fast on a straight Indian diet . Michael motioned for the driver to pull over and showed him the map . The driver had trouble reading it , started talking rapidly , pointing ahead . Michael let him go on , and they halted at a busy street corner where two hundred bicycles waited for a green light . The driver got out with the map and talked to several men standing in front of a tea shop . Arms waved , heads shook , hands pointed . All of this went on for a minute or two before the driver returned . He said something Michael did n't understand , zigzagging his hand , which Michael took to mean they should work their way through the city and then turn right . That seemed to fit , based on the map . They plowed up the busy main drag of Pondy and eventually hit a dead end at Rue St. Louis . The driver got out , went through the arms-head-hand language again , and came back to the car . A right turn , then skirting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French Legionnaires by the looks of their caps . A few blocks farther on another right , then a left . Painted on a building were the words Rue Suffren . Number 12 came up a half block later . Slow Waltz in Cedar Bend 139  | Michael knocked on the high wooden gate . An old Indian man in tan shorts and a white headwrap peeked out . Michael said , " Room ? " The gatekeeper glanced at the car and driver , then back at the tall American with wrinkled clothes and no luggage except a knapsack . Almost reluctantly he swung the gate open and indicated Michael should come into the courtyard . It was an old building , covered with vines and bougainvillea . Maigrit , Michael assumed it was him , came out of a doorway . Michael bowed slightly . " Do you have a room for a tired traveler ? " Maigrit looked at him , said nothing . Michael had arrived without prior reservations , which was probably considered a serious breach of decorum . Michael did n't speak much French , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his Ph.D . language requirement . But he smiled the good midwestern smile that seemed to get him by in most of the world and gave it a try : " Je voudrais une chambre ? " Maigrit smiled back , recognizing incompetence but approving of the effort . Yes , a room was available for 150 rupees , about 9 dollars a night . Michael figured with advance reservations and a little haggling he could have knocked it down about a third or maybe half , but he was tired , and the location suited him . Maigrit informed him the daily afternoon water shutoff was in progress , so a bath was not possible , but the boy , who was about seventy-five , would bring a small bucket of water if Monsieur Tillman wanted to wash up . Michael thanked him and said that would be appreciated . And was laundry service available ? Shirts could be washed , ironed , and returned in four  | hours for double the normal price . The regular price was six cents a shirt . The boy delivered water , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then lay down on the bed and thought . Home was forty-six hours behind , though his internal abacus lied and said it was longer , years maybe . A week ago he 'd been sitting in his apartment waiting for Jellie to return from Syracuse . Ten days ago she lay naked on his kitchen table while he rubbed red wine over her breasts . " Jellie , are you somewhere on the other side of these walls , close by , living out what you never want me to know ? "  | Michael awakened a little before six when the old man rapped on his door . He 'd slept for nearly four hours and got up feeling hot and stiff and road weary . He opened the door , took the shirts , and gave the man a tip . The old man bowed and left , looking back at Michael over his shoulder . Michael checked the faucets . The water had come back on , and he was a little surprised when the left tap gave him a warm stream . He ran a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean body , clean shirt , and fresh pair of Levi 's . The proprietor was on the veranda , reading a French newspaper . What Michael needed first was flexible transportation , a motorcycle . He 'd seen a number of smaller bikes when the driver brought him through town . Yes , a small motorcycle could be 142 Robert James Waller  | rented at a location on Mahatma Gandhi Road . Maigrit had the gatekeeper call a bicycle rickshaw for Michael and spoke in Tamil to the rickshaw man , giving him the address . Maigrit said the ride would cost a quarter , and a dime tip would be about right . Michael watched the bulging leg muscles of the man pedaling him through the streets of Pondicherry . Unlike some Westerners who had never traveled in these places and frowned on the use of rickshaws as something next to slavery , Michael did n't see it that way . If you asked the rickshaw man how he felt about it , he would n't understand the question . It was how he made his living , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fee . It was called participating in the local economy . As Michael once told a colleague who disdained such colonialist behavior , " Pay the rickshaw man New York cab fare , maybe it will make you feel more politically correct . " Taxi or rickshaw , it was all a matter of muscle power with differences in the degree of it used . India was , in many ways , an evening country . The heat and dust settled down late in the day , and the streets were crowded . Merchants stayed open late . Time then for long , leisurely dinners and laughter in the cafes , commencing around nightfall . The rickshaw man turned left on Sastry Street , pedaling a straight line toward MG Road . Michael sat there feeling exposed , not wanting Jellie to see him coasting along through the streets of Pondicherry . Christ , he thought , how strange this is . Here I am looking for a woman with whom I 've made love , a woman who rolls in pleasure beneath my touch and says over and over again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about her seeing me . It 's a curious world , Michael Tillman . That 's what he said to himself as the rickshaw bumped along through the south India twilight . The motorcycle rental outfit was located in a little garage next to the Cool Cat Coffee Bar with grease everywhere and parts scattered about . Michael felt at home . Two machines leaned against the door , two more were torn down inside . Michael could have either of the two by the door . He looked them over . They were rough as the roads they traveled and pretty well banged up . The old Kawasaki looked like it might run , and after a few kicks he had it going . The proprietor stood watching him , hands on hips , not smiling . Michael pointed to tools on the workbench . Ten minutes later he had the chain tightened and the carburetor adjusted . The garage man was grinning . Technical competence always brought respect . Michael paid a fifty-dollar deposit and recalibrated his mind to driving on the left-hand side of the road , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until he got the feel of driving in what always seemed the wrong way . He took the same route back to the hotel as he 'd come , picking up two plastic containers of bottled water on the way , and parked the bike in the courtyard . Tonight he 'd walk . When the search needed to be expanded or he had to get somewhere in a hurry , the bike would take him there . Maigrit greeted him and said what a handsome machine Michael had found . Michael took out the picture of Jellie and said he was looking for her . Maigrit looked at it , then at Michael , and asked , 144 Robert James Waller  | " Amour ? " Michael smiled and nodded . Maigrit was sorry , but he 'd never seen her . " There are many Western women who come here to participate in the ashram . They look for comfort and inner peace , perhaps a new way of life . " The Frenchman no longer operated a restaurant in his hotel , but if Michael wanted continental food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Park Guest House . It was a club , though membership rules were not tightly enforced . Simply walk through the gate , cross the courtyard , and go up the steps . Michael thought twice about going there . He was n't too worried about running into Jellie , because he figured she wanted to sink back into Indian ways and would take her meals at Indian restaurants or , more likely , cook for herself . But word moved fast in these Indian towns , and he had a feeling the Western community would pass the news about a newcomer who wore jeans and sandals and seemed to be looking for someone . But he was hungry and was n't ready for Indian cuisine yet , so he walked through quiet streets in the direction the Frenchman had directed him . A few people sat on steps in this section of the city , but most of the houses were behind high walls . Two white men with shaved heads and wearing saffron-colored wraps , bare legs poking out from thigh level down , went by in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned left on Rue Bazare St. Laurent , missed his right turn on Rue Dumas , and came to Cours Chabrol  --  Beach Road  --  running along the seawall . The night breeze was kind , and Michael stood in the  | shadows at the end of Rue Bazare St. Laurent without crossing over to the seawall . The walkways were crowded with evening strollers . Off to his right , just up the road , was the gated entrance to the Park Guest House , the ashram 's hotel . When two Western women in Indian dress came along the sidewalk , he turned around , heading back up the street he had just come down , feeling odd , as if he were involved in an international espionage operation . Jellie , what have you done to me ? I was content , if not supremely happy , before we met , and here I am walking the back streets of India looking for you , and in some small part of me not wanting to find you , fearful of what you might say , of what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of your life . A guard stood at the Alliance Francaise 's gate . Michael pointed at his own chest , then pointed inside and said , " Restaurant ? " The guard nodded and motioned him through the gate . There were trees and flowers in the courtyard . Off to one side was a cement platform where an Indian woman was dancing to the rhythm of a drummer sitting cross-legged in the shadows behind her . No one else was in the courtyard , but he could hear an accordion playing a French song in the building ahead of him . Michael watched the dancer for a moment . She was oblivious of him , stopping after a moment and speaking to the drummer , who then started off again in a slightly different rhythm . The first floor of the place had a unisex bathroom and a black-and-white photography exhibition hang-146 Robert James Waller  | ing on its gray walls . Music and laughter came from the floor above , and he went up the stairs into the restaurant . Half of it was covered , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapidly around in white uniforms , and a young Indian in dark slacks and purple shirt came toward Michael , speaking in French . Michael smiled and said , " Dinner , please ? " " Just one , monsieur ? " His English was very good . Michael nodded . " Do you prefer indoors or outside ? " " Outside , please . " The maitre d ' seated Michael at a small table off in a corner . Michael 's entrance caused a few curious heads to turn , but the laughter and eating and drinking quickly resumed . He ordered beer and a chicken brochette from the open-flame barbecue built into the wall across the room from where he was seated . Stars were out , the scent of jasmine came on the night wind , and he sat there alone , staring at his hands . The food was excellent , served with rice and French bread . And chocolate cake with good strong coffee afterward . He was starting to feel somewhat whole again . On his way out , an older man had taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to him , the man smiled warmly . " Did you enjoy your dinner ? " Michael told him it was very good , then showed him the picture of Jellie . The maitre d ' looked at it , then at Michael , repeated those two moves , and stopped smiling . " Have you seen her ? " Michael asked . Slow Waltz in Cedar Bend 147  | The maitre d ' stared at him and did n't answer . " I 'm looking for her ; it 's very important I find her . " The man lit a cigarette , looked at the picture again , then handed it back to Michael . " Long time ago , maybe . " " How long ? A week ? How long ? " " Long time . Ten , fifteen years . It 's hard to say ; the woman I 'm thinking of was much younger . Excuse me , I have work to do . " Michael took a deep breath and wondered . The man had looked at him . and the photo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the maitre d ' recognized Jellie 's picture and wanted to be done with Michael as soon as possible . Michael walked back to his hotel through dark , quiet streets , still wondering . For two days he wandered Pondicherry with no organized search strategy . On the third day he took the bike out to Auroville , but it was spread out over miles , little settlements and houses scattered about . If she was there , he 'd never find her . In early evenings he sat on the seawall near the ashram guest house and watched traffic coming for the evening meal . He tried talking with the austere woman guarding the front desk of the guest house , but that was useless . People came there to get away and be left alone . When Michael showed her the photo of Jellie , the woman shook her head and went back to her ledgers . He was getting nowhere and asked Maigrit for directions to the college he 'd read about in the guide . Maigrit ran his finger along the street map , showing 148 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get there . Michael wheeled the Kawasaki out of the hotel courtyard , kicked the starter , and rolled north through the city . The college was in a shabby section of Pondicherry . Cruising around the small campus , Michael saw a weathered sign reading " Department of Man-agement . " Time to flash the credentials . He introduced himself to a secretary , telling her who he was and where he was from . This was a situation where titles would help . Indians loved credentials and respected professors only a little less than credentials . She went down a hallway into an office , coming back in less than a minute , followed by a short , round , Indian man in his fifties . He wore glasses and a necktie reaching about halfway down his chest . Friendly smile . " Ah , Dr. Tillman , how good of you to call on us . " He wanted to know all about Michael 's academic life . Michael ran the list of degrees and experience , impatient to get on with the reason he 'd come . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pomp , and he was bound to reciprocate . Before long they were joined by two economists , with tea served by the secretary shortly after . One of the professors excused himself , saying he would return momentarily . When he did , a copy of The Atlantic was in his hand . It was opened to Michael 's article on tax incentives . He pointed to the article , then at Michael . " And did you write this , Dr. Tillman ? " Michael nodded . The professor smiled then , big smile . " Quite a brilliant piece of work . Very nice indeed . " Credibility had been established , Michael was on his home ground , and these were bright , decent peo-  | ple he was dealing with . He told them about searching for Jellie , leaving out the background details , saying only it was extremely important he locate her . They did n't recognize her photo , but when Michael mentioned Jellie 's interest in anthropology , the department head called to his secretary and spoke to her out in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the anthropology professors to talk with you . There are many projects in anthropology going on in Pondicherry . The French especially have strong interests in those areas , having established an institute some years ago with which our college cooperates . " In ten minutes a woman appeared in the office doorway . She was fortyish and wore a pink sari . The department head stood , introducing her as Dr. Dhavale , professor of anthropology . The photo of Jellie , which was becoming a little shopworn after being held by a hundred hands in the last few days , was lying on the desk . Immediately the anthropology professor picked it up , glanced at it , then looked at Mi-chael . His heartbeat went up twenty points . " Is there any chance you know the woman in the picture ? " The professor 's face was cautious . " You say your name is Tillman ? Michael Tillman ? " " Yes . " " From a place called Cedar Bend ? " His pulse jumped another ten points . " Yes . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please ? " She was addressing the department head . " Oh , yes , of course , Dr. Dhavale . Dr. Tillman , could we impose upon you to give a lecture or two  | while you are in town ? I know our students and faculty would very much appreciate it . " They 'd been helpful . Saying no was a problem , a matter of both courtesy and gratitude . " Dr. Ramani , I will be happy to do that sometime . First , however , I must not delay in finding Mrs. Braden . When I have done that , may I contact you and set up the lectures if I am going to be in Pondicherry ? " " Yes , yes , certainly . We understand , though we are disappointed you must hurry off . Please let us know when you can lecture for us , and we will set up a very nice afternoon with a reception afterwards . " Michael said he 'd do that and followed Dr. Dhavale out of the building across a courtyard into another building , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in seventy-two hours he did not feel tired . She sat across her desk from him , black eyes bold and cool , sizing him up . " Jellie Markham and I became friends years ago , during the time she was here for her thesis work . " She used Jellie 's maiden name and the French pronunciation with the soft j ? JahLAY  --  for her first name . " We have corresponded with each other through the years and have remained close . " Michael said nothing but began to understand how dumb he 'd been for the last three days , using Jellie 's married name and the American pronunciation of her Christian name . Even if someone had known her , they would n't have recognized the names he was giving them if she 'd assumed the French version when she lived in Pondicherry . And that would make sense , given the heavy French atmosphere permeating the city .  | " Dr. Dhavale , I 'm forty-three . It took a lot of years for me to be able to feel about someone the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I need to find her , I need your help to do it . " The anthropologist studied him as if she were deciding on a final course grade . " I do not wish to violate her confidence , so I 'm not sure of how much to say , Dr. Tillman . But I know Jellie has strong feelings for you . She has lived a complicated life , more complicated than you can imagine . But those details are for her to tell you when she chooses . She sent a letter to you , giving you my name and address in case you wanted to contact her . But I do n't think she anticipated you would show up on my doorstep . Did you receive her letter ? " " No . I must have left before it arrived in Cedar Bend . I found you quite by accident . " " This is very difficult for me , Dr. Tillman , please understand that . I want to help you , but I do not wish to upset Jellie and ruin our friendship by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad about not saying a proper good-bye to you . " Chitra Dhavale looked out the only window in her office , dusty window , then turned back to Michael . " She left several days ago for Thekkady . Do you know of it ? " No . " It is a village quite near a beautiful place called Lake Periyar . Jellie told me you spent time in south India , so I thought you might have heard of it . She is staying with people named Sudhana who live in the countryside near Thekkady . " " May I ask what she is doing there ? Do you know ? "  | " Yes , I know , but that is part of what is not my place to tell you , and I am afraid I have already violated her confidence by saying what I have said . " " What is the best way to Thekkady ? The best route ? " " You could go back to Madras and fly to Cochin or Madurai , taking a car after that . Perhaps a better , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train out of Pondicherry . It is a meter-gauge railway , so you ride it just down to Villupuram Junction , which is approximately forty kilometers from here . From there you take the Trivandrum Mail southward and get off in Madurai . After that you can either take a bus or hire a car and driver to take you on to Thekkady . It is an arduous trip , Dr. Tillman , but it is probably the quickest route . Your other alternative , flying out of Madras , may be frustrating . You might arrive there and not be able to find a seat on a flight for several days . " She looked at her watch . " It 's a little before twelve . If you hurry , Dr. Tillman , you can catch the one o'clock train to Villupuram . I have a feeling you are anxious to be on your way , am I not correct ? " She gave him a warm , Indian-woman smile . " If you find Jellie Markham , please tell her of my distress over this and ask her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you where she is . " " I will . Thank you , Dr. Dhavale . " As he went out her office door , Chitra Dhavale said , " Dr. Tillman ? " He turned , paused . " Jellie may be using the name Velayudum instead of Braden or Markham . Do n't ask me why . Just accept what I have told you . And I should add this : If  | you find her , things may seem somewhat strange and perhaps quite disappointing , or at least unsettling to you . As I said before , Jellie has lived a complicated life . " So it was the Trivandrum Mail south to Madurai and a car westward after that .  | Thekkady lies on the border between the states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala , in the high country of southwest India . On the edge of town is a gate across the road , a red bar that reminded Michael of the old Checkpoint Charlie in Berlin . The driver halted and went into a small office near the road . Any moment Michael expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a John Le Cane novel , something about a man coming in from the East tonight . All hell broke loose in the office . The driver showed his papers , but apparently crossing from one state to another in this area was pretty much the same as going from one country to the next . From what Michael could make out , the Kerala authorities refused to honor the much trumpeted , all-India driver 's license .  | Michael got out , leaned against the car . More words that turned into shouting and what sounded like threats . He pointed to the bar , lifted his knapsack , and asked with sign language if he could cross . It was more complicated than he 'd thought , requiring a twenty-dollar bill in the hand of the border official to get him through after paying off the driver . Baksheesh , it 's called , and it was everywhere and always had been . Cool mountain air and thin yellow sunlight , quiet village in midafternoon , dusty road . Michael walked down it , his boots leaving deep footprints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The young Indian man was standing by a jeep . Michael looked at a name scribbled in his pocket notebook , then walked over to the jeep man and said , " Maybe . Find people called Sudhana , first . " " No , boss , we go lake only . " He whacked the side of the jeep . " Two hundred rupees for ride . Pretty place there . " It might be pretty , but that was n't where Michael was going . He held up three one-hundred-rupee bank notes . " Find house of Sudhana , first . Then two hundred more if I want to go to the lake . " It turned out maybe the jeep did n't have to go to the lake after all . The young man was in no hurry and started talking to several others hanging around . They looked at Michael and laughed . The young bastards were always brave in groups . They knew he had cash , big cash to them . Stuck in his belt , under his wrinkled bush jacket , was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . He could feel the handle pressing into his back . 156 Robert James Waller  | A few years ago he 'd held the knife against the throat of a taxi driver late one night in Mysore , north of here , when things were getting rough and a crowd of young smart-asses was encouraging the driver to dump him and a female companion out of the cab . When the Mysore driver felt the blade against his skin he let out the clutch as if he were having a muscle spasm , knocking two of the smart boys on their rears . An older man came out of a store , shouting . From what Michael could tell , the man owned the jeep and was ordering a general shaping up and getting on with business . There was chatter in multiple dialects , the name Sudhana mentioned several times . The older man sketched on a piece of cardboard and handed it to the younger one , who had called Michael " boss . " He walked over to the jeep , grinning , patting the jump seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . The young one and another bundle of insolence about the same age got in the front seats . They bounced off down the dirt road and turned south onto a different road running high above the eastern side of a fast mountain stream . More turns , winding around a low mountain , then left up a smaller road . The driver slammed to a stop in front of a house with tin patches on the sides and roof . " Sudhana , there ? " He pointed . " Cigarettes ? " Michael gave them each an American cigarette , which was something of a luxury in these parts . Both lit up immediately , and Michael walked on unsteady legs toward the house . The old doubts ? Was this the place ? Was he doing the right thing ? Jellie , do n't turn me away , do n't do that . Whatever is going on , let me be part of it . Slow Waltz in Cedar Bend 157  | The forehead and eyes of a crone appeared over a windowsill , then disappeared immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Sudhana ? " Michael called out . Nothing . " Jellie ? Jellie , it 's Michael . " Still nothing . Then slowly the door opened a crack , and the old woman looked out . She spoke rapidly in words he did n't understand . " Jellie . . . JahLAY . Jellie . . . JahLAY . " He said her name over and over again , then added the surname he had been told she might be using , and the words were strange on his tongue . " Jellie Velayudum . JahLAY Velayudum . " The woman shook her head , spoke rapidly in a croaking voice , and pointed in a direction that looked as if it were inside the house . Christ , had something happened or what ? Was Jellie lying in there ? The driver swaggered over to where Michael was trying to climb the wall between cultures . " Cigarette , boss ? I know what old woman is saying . " More baksheesh . You get a little tired of it after a while . It 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damned arrogance , the use of leverage . Michael gave him half a pack of Merits . " She say woman called JahLAY Velayudum is at old hunting lodge in the middle of the lake , place called Lake Palace Hotel . You want go there ? " Michael nodded , and the driver flipped his head toward the jeep . They went down around the mountain and got on the road along the river again . Seven minutes later the jeep came over a rise , and Lake Periyar looked blue and calm in the distance . The jeep driver dropped Michael off at the Aranya Nivas Hotel , a hundred yards from the lake-158 Robert James Waller  | shore . He asked for more cigarettes , and Michael told him to stuff it . Michael Tillman was tired of smart young bastards , whatever country they come from , and said as much . He 'd been too passive , too intent on finding Jellie , putting up with too much nonsense . The driver retreated in the face of Michael 's anger , shrugged his shoulders , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went inside , grubby and tired . The woman at the desk was perfectly done , turquoise sari and a face that would launch a thousand Porsches back in the States . She was polite and efficient , and he was ready for some of that . He asked about the Lake Palace Hotel . She told him it was an old maharajah 's hunting lodge with only six guest rooms and that reservations were handled here at the Aranya Nivas . While she flipped through a reservations book , Michael stared at a photograph on the wall behind her . It was slightly faded , but still a beautiful shot of a tiger coming out of tall grass on a foggy morning and carried the signature Robert Kincaid . The clerk said there were rooms available for the next four nights . After that it was completely booked for a week . Three continental meals each day were included in the price . The big question . He asked it : " I 'm supposed to meet a woman at the Lake Palace . I wonder if she has checked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JahLAY . I believe she is registered under the name Velayudum , though she might be using Markham or Braden . " It all sounded rather suspicious , vaguely clandestine , but he had decided to cover all the bases . " Three of the rooms are currently occupied out Slow Waltz in Cedar Bend 159  | there . " She looked up at him . " And you say you are to meet someone ? " " Yes . My arrival date , however , was uncertain . " " I have a Velayudum listed here . There are two people registered under that name . " Michael staggered inside himself . All the months , all the miles , the dreams . Forty-three , and he was standing there looking stupid while Jellie was registered under an Indian name and sharing the room with someone , most likely a man named Velayudum from somewhere back in her India days . Jellie  --  all the things I do n't know about you . Michael would always remember how alone he felt at that moment , incredibly alone and lonely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman asked , " Sir , would you still like a room at the Lake Palace ? " He could go back to Madurai , fly to Madras , and change his homeward flight . Then he thought , This is foolish male vanity you 're suffering , Tillman . You 're not thinking clearly , afraid of what you might find in the middle of the lake . You 're not going anywhere except out to that hotel and hit the end of this at full speed , if that 's what it comes to . " Put me down for one night , please . The hotel is on an island , is that correct ? " " Yes , we call it an island . There is a narrow strip of swamp connecting it to the mainland . It 's approximately a twenty-minute boat ride from the jetty . " " What boat , what jetty ? " " Go out the front door , turn right , and walk down the path . You 'll see a small building with a sign 160 Robert James Waller  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . The ticket agent will direct you to the proper boat . The island is in one of India 's largest tiger preserves , and since you will be staying there you must also purchase an entrance permit to the preserve . If you want to take a safari into the jungle , you can make arrangements for a guide at the same time you purchase your boat ticket . Without a guide , you will not be allowed to leave the hotel grounds , since there are large animals about and it is much too dangerous . " As Michael turned to leave he asked , " Was the photograph behind you taken here ? " " Yes , on the island where the Lake Palace is located . I 'm told the photographer who took it came here often some years ago and always stayed at the Lake Palace . " Down the path to the sanctuary office . Hundreds of Indian tourists milling around on the jetty below and several old excursion boats rocking in the water . Michael handed the room voucher to a wildlife officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying Michael should show his hotel voucher to the pilot of the Miss Lake Periyar . The pilot would then drop him off at the hotel . It was a mess . Travel was never easy in India , and this was something altogether different . There were three excursion boats , two of them in the process of loading , one already packed with Indian tourists . Two hundred future boat passengers , porters , and assorted hangers-on were packed on the jetty . The loaded boat had Miss Lake Periyar painted on its starboard side .  | He fought his way through the crowd , got on the boat , and showed one of the hands the hotel voucher . The man seemed disinterested but nodded and indicated with a toss of his head that Michael should find a seat . The dominant feeling permeating all travel in India was one of ambiguity , and Michael had serious doubts as to whether the pilot would be notified he was to be dropped at the hotel . The boat was constructed with two levels , a glassed-in first level and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but there was shouting and laughter and calls to those left on the jetty , the sum of which was pandemonium . Children ran up and down the steps between the first and second levels , people got off the boat to talk to those left behind , then got back on again . The boathand Michael had talked to was making a reasonable attempt at crowd control but was failing miserably , overwhelmed by the crush . How , Michael wondered , could any animals be spotted along the shore , if that indeed was the main thrust of the boat tour . The boat would sound like pharaoh 's army coming over the water toward them . The boathand got tough when the engine turned over . He ordered people to sit down and stay seated . Michael checked again , but every seat on the boat was filled , so he hunkered down on the steps leading to the upper deck with a young boy sitting on the step just below his feet . The boy twisted his neck and looked at him while Michael stared out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jetty and chugged slowly down the huge , narrow lake , a reser-162 Robert James Waller  | voir stretching for miles behind the Periyar Dam , constructed by the British in 1895 . A narration came from small loudspeakers mounted at various places on the boat , sometimes in English , sometimes in one of the Indian languages , telling the passengers they might see various animals ranging from leopards to tigers to elephants to wild pigs . Michael figured if they saw any animals at all , they 'd be flopped down in laughter at the strange mammals packed onto an old green contraption that should 've sunk twenty years ago . Late afternoon now , sun dropping . Michael 's boat and the two eventually following were the last sight-seeing runs of the day . Heavy jungle along the shore except for fifty feet or so of bare dirt running down to the water in some places . Michael stood up for a moment and could see a high hill with trees , looking as though it sat hard and straight in the boat 's course . Ten minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lake Palace . " Michael was tight , so tight his breath was coming in short little intakes and exhales , as if he were finishing a long sprint , which he was . Across the sunlit water of India on a December afternoon Michael Tillman went , fearful , terribly so , of what he was going to find ahead of him . A wooden jetty stuck out fifteen feet from the island 's shore , and he could see wide stone steps behind the jetty leading up into heavy forest . A long red tile roof was visible through breaks in the foliage . On the jetty was an Indian boy of about fifteen . The desk clerk at the Aranya Nivas had radioed the lodge to say a guest was on the Miss Lake Periyar . Slow Waltz in Cedar Bend 163  | The pilot expertly swung the boat broadside to the jetty 's end , and Michael jumped off . The boy pointed at the knapsack on Michael 's shoulder , and Michael gave it to him . They began the long climb up the stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty feet above them . Halfway up Michael touched the boy 's shoulder , signaling he wanted to stop for a moment . He sat on a wooden bench beside the steps , put his head in his hands , and thought , imagining what he might see at the top of the steps and thinking about how he would handle whatever was there . The boy stood patiently , looking off into the jungle . After a minute or two , Michael got up and they continued . At the top of the stairs he followed the boy over a red dirt area where the jungle had been cut back around the entire circumference of the lodge . Off to Michael 's right an Indian couple sat on the veranda in front of their room . They were drinking tea but paused to watch the new arrival come across the dirt and onto the veranda south of them . The manager appeared with a room key , looked Michael over , and said dinner would be served at seven , adding informal dress was appropriate . He asked if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kingfisher beers and followed the boy along the veranda . The room was spacious with a double bed and a bath area in a separate room to the rear , furniture of slightly battered white wicker . Two large windows with heavy wooden shutters that were closed faced the veranda , and an overhead fan turned slowly . A smaller window in the bath area also had the same 164 Robert James Waller  | heavy shutters . The boy put Michael 's knapsack on one of the beds and scurried around , turning on lights . Michael tipped him , and he was gone , closing the door behind him . Michael looked at his watch . Three hours before dinner . He showered and dressed in a clean khaki shirt and jeans , traded his boots for sandals , drinking Kingfisher and preparing himself for what was to come . He was ready , if there was any real way to be ready for what he was sure he 'd discover . No excuse to lounge around in the room , so he walked outside on the cement veranda , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lodge . A trench , about five feet deep and three feet wide , circled the lodge out beyond the open dirt area where the jungle began . Michael was pretty sure the trench was designed to hold at bay unreliable things snarling along on short legs or crawling on scaled bellies , tongues flickering . The Indian couple he 'd seen earlier were standing near their room at the far end of the lodge . They were on the crest of a hill dropping off to the lake and were looking through binoculars at something across the water on the opposite shore . They called the boy over and asked him a question . " Wild pigs , " he said . Purple-blue flowers curled from the roof . Far down the lake Michael heard a sound . It took him a moment to recognize it : elephant . In the distance he could hear the low beating of an excursion boat 's engine . He sat there on the south end of a veranda in south India , lit a cigarette , and started on his second beer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Slow Waltz in Cedar Bend 165  | Behind him and north along the veranda he heard a door open and the sound of voices , one of them Jellie 's , he thought . Adrenaline hit Michael Tillman 's arteries in a surge faster and stronger than anything he 'd experienced in his basketball days or , for that matter , ever before in any circumstance . The warrior had come to fight for his woman , his body was preparing itself . Now was the moment . Now  --  do it , Tillman . Do it and get it over with , settle your affairs , here in the jungle . Where else have men ever settled their affairs ? He turned and saw a young Indian woman , fifteen or sixteen years , come out of an open doorway . Her black shining hair was in a long braid , and she had on a sari of a deep orange color , bracelets on her arms and around one ankle , silver toe rings , and straw-colored sandals . Jellie Markham/Braden/Velayudum , or whoever she was on that day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stretch of open dirt toward the jungle . " It 's a beautiful evening , Jaya , " Michael heard her say . The young woman answered her , " Yes , it is . This is the loveliest place I 've ever seen . The mountain air is so clean and cool after the lowland heat . I 've always looked forward to our time here . " Jellie looked down the veranda , gray eyes taking in the scenery , casually glancing at a man sitting by himself at a table . The young woman started to speak but saw Jellie 's face and followed her eyes . They both stared for a moment , then the young woman looked again at Jellie 's face , but Jellie never took her eyes 166 Robert James Waller  | off Michael Tillman . He waited for a man named Velayudum to come out of the doorway and put his arm around Jellie , but no one came . Jellie was frozen where she stood . Michael looked back at her . She wore the traditional Indian woman 's outfit called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottoms gathering themselves just above her white sandals , all of it done in the palest of lavenders . She had a red scarf draped around her neck with the ends of it hanging over her shoulders and down her back . And , like the young woman , she wore an ankle bracelet and toe rings . Her hair shone in the half-light on the veranda , and hung straight and long , parted off to one side , just as she wore it back in Cedar Bend , sometimes tucking it up under a tweed cap . Cedar Bend ? Where in the hell was that ? Did it exist anymore , or had it ever existed ? Maybe .. . maybe somewhere in another time , somewhere back down along the crinkled chain of living and loving and working , it had once existed . Back in the same , forgotten , and ancient world as Custer , South Dakota , where a boy worked late in the night shooting baskets and repairing an old English motorcycle that would take him over the roads of his life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jellie took the girl 's hand and came toward him . He stood up , saying nothing , watching her eyes , which never left his . She let go of the girl 's hand , put her arms around his waist , and laid her head against his chest . He touched her hair . She lifted her face and kissed him .  | She turned to the girl . " Jaya , this is Michael Tillman , the man I 've been telling you about . " Her eyes on Michael 's face again , steady eyes . " Michael , this is my daughter , Jaya Velayudum. "  | Dhiren Velayudum : revolutionary , member of a radical separatist group that fought everyone and everything connected with the central Indian government . And Jellie Markham , young and idealistic back in the middle sixties , young and idealistic and off to India to write her thesis . Movie stuff : Tamil warrior-poet meets young American woman with her own dreams of how things ought to be . At bottom , Dhiren Velayudum was a terrorist , and Jellie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem like terrorism in their nights of loving and days filled with quixotic visions of a great revolutionary flow that could not be halted . She married Dhiren in a traditional Indian ceremony . The shrieking death-dance of her parents when they found out could be heard all the way from Syracuse . Things went bad for the radicals , and there were Slow Waltz in Cedar Bend 169  | wild months of running with Dhiren , hiding in villages and cities . Then came an afternoon road winding high into the Western Ghats , the same road Michael would travel one day years later . The car in which Dhiren and Jellie were riding moved slowly around hairpin curves . Suddenly Dhiren was pushing Jellie , shouting for her to get out of the car and hide . She got out , carrying Jaya , and crouched behind a jumble of deadfall . Dhiren pitched from the other side of the car and ran for the trees on the opposite side of the road , ninemillimeter , Russian-made pistol in his hand . The sound of automatic weapons . Bullets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claws tracking him and closing fast , then crawling up and across his body . Dhiren spinning , stumbling into the forest . That night at the Lake Palace Hotel , Jellie and Michael sat on the veranda for two hours after Jaya went to bed . She told the story , all of it , leaving out nothing . How she felt about Dhiren , her memories of him . How she carried her baby along the night roads of south India after Dhiren had been shot , walking all night into Thekkady , where there were sympathizers with the radicals ' cause . How the India government punished her by refusing to issue an exit visa for Jaya so Jellie could take her to the States . She told him how Leonard Markham had come for her , all the way to Delhi , and the words he 'd said : " Let 's go home , Jellie . We 'll find a way to get your baby to America . " She looked off into the night . " It 's amazing what parents can forgive . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jaya a visa and failed , her father helping her and 170 Robert James Waller  | pounding on authorities from Washington , D.C. , to New Delhi . But India put on its silent , impenetrable face , and nothing happened . Jellie sat with her knees pulled up , her arms wrapped around them while she talked . " Chitra kept track of things on the Indian side and wrote to say it was still not possible to get the necessary papers for Jaya . I tried to come back , but the Indian government denied me an entrance visa . " Can you imagine the agony , Michael ? Three years it went on that way . I kept applying for a visa , and then for no reason I 've ever been able to figure out , they issued me one . I simply became unimportant to them after a while , I guess . " I could have given up my U.S. citizenship and perhaps become an Indian citizen , but I was n't ready to do that , and I 'm not sure India would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the country . I even thought about smuggling her out , but everyone I talked to said it was too risky , that I could end up in an Indian prison for years and leave Jaya without any mother at all . " Michael nodded , his face serious . When something important was being said , when attention was called for , Michael Tillman was a world-class listener . And he was listening now to what Jellie Braden was saying . He narrowed his eyes , then rubbed them with his palms , trying to settle himself as he started to understand things he had n't anticipated . It began to sink in , hard : he 'd underestimated Jellie . She was n't simply a bright , good-looking woman married to one of his colleagues . Instead , she had lived another life alien to anything he could have imagined . She was 1 Slow Waltz in Cedar Bend 171  | far more an adult than he had realized , far more sophisticated in a worldly fashion than he would ever be . She was talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would not be able to comprehend or experience , no matter how much she told him , how much he thought about it . Jesus , automatic weapons and mountain roads , a man who had given her a child in a swirl of flight and idealistic revolutionary doctrine . She had laughed and cried with this man , and loved him wildly and freely and carried her baby as she ran with him . He felt a strange combination of sadness for her and envy for Dhiren Velayudum , who had touched places in her that he , Michael Tillman , could never touch . What a goddamned stupid joke , he thought , his wrong and undue assumptions about himself and Jellie and how he presumed Jellie saw him  --  for the last year he had been measuring Michael Tillman against Jimmy Braden , not against a man with the power and spirit of Dhiren Velayudum , a man who had lived for just the right amount of time and died at just the right moment to create a larger-than-life image in the far back memories ofJellie Braden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal , for it had never been lessened by the slog of ordinary , daily existence . Michael let out a long breath , while Jellie caught hers and continued . " All of this time Jaya was becoming a young Indian girl . I finally decided maybe it was best she be raised in Indian ways . I did n't seem to have any other choice . The decision was made : Jaya would continue to live with the Sudhanas until she was old enough for boarding school , and I would visit her as often as I could .  | " I sent money to the Sudhanas , tormenting myself all these years that I was not here to see my little girl growing up . Yet I do n't know if it could have worked out any better . Jaya is a fine young woman . But I did visit every year , and we always came out here to the Lake Palace for a while . So at least she got to know her real mother pretty well , though we have become more like sisters than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my salary from whatever job I 've had over the years , and that money went to India , to the Sudhanas and to Jaya . She entered boarding school when she was six and has been there since . " When I met Jimmy Braden and married him , all I said was I 'd been involved with an Indian man who had died and I still had a lot of friends over here who needed financial help . The lie rested in what I did n't say . I told him I would be coming alone to visit every year . Jimmy , I think , would have agreed to anything , just to get me to marry him  --  I know that sounds terrible , but it 's true  --  so he said it was not a problem . He 's never complained once about my visits to India , and he 's never asked any questions about what it is I do when I 'm over here . As I 've said before , Jimmy has his good qualities . " Michael got up and walked behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hair . Jellie Braden looked off into the night . Something large and moving fast crashed through the jungle fifty yards back of the lodge . Jellie stood and looked up at him , put her hands on his face . " Michael , Dhiren was a lot like you , in some ways , but I do n't want you to think you 're  | some kind of latter-day surrogate for him . That 's not true at all , and you must believe me when I say it . " He smiled and said , " I believe you , Jellie , " though he was n't quite as sure about it as he sounded . " I came to India this time because I needed to think and to talk with Jaya about us . I wanted to make sure of how I felt and for her to understand . When you found me this evening I was already turning for home , Michael . I was turning for home , toward you . In his room he laid her down and kissed her in all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy scratching at the door and the sense of great bulk moving around outside . Michael sat up . " What the hell is that ? Sounds like a bear . " " I think that 's what it is . I heard it last night . " " There used to be a lot of them in the Black Hills . They go on like that . I have some fruit in my knapsack , and the bear can probably smell it . He 'll go away after a bit . " The bear left and was replaced by the tickety-tick of fast little feet running over roof tiles . Michael and Jellie lay in the darkness together . " Sounds like India on the move again , " he whispered to her . Jellie went back to her room an hour before dawn . Michael lay awake , thinking about all they had talked about . Twenty minutes in front of first light he dressed and went outside into heavy , dripping fog wrapped around the lodge and turning open spaces into closed ones , turning the jungle into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lake ,  | which was only about a hundred yards wide where the island divided it , a monkey called , sounding far and lonesome . The classic jungle sound from old Tarzan movies . Elephants again , closer now . The monkey let go once more and was joined by a few others , along with intermittent calls from awakening birds . His small flashlight took him through the fog and down the stone steps to the water . Why he was doing this he was n't certain . Something to do with loving Jellie and knowing where he stood with her , a little early morning celebration of his own , some time to rearrange how he saw her in light of what she 'd told him about her early years in India . He sat on a jetty post where he could look out to the opposite side of the lake and down the shoreline to his right . He sat there and waited , listening for sounds beyond the lapping of small waves . First light came up , translucent through the fog . He was staring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the lodge above him , not looking at anything in particular . The fog swayed in an early breeze and began turning into a yellowish mist as the sun poked its way through a gap in the eastern hills . The tiger saw Michael before Michael saw him . The cat was thirty yards down the shore , drops of water coming off its muzzle as it lifted its head after drinking . It did n't move , just kept that big head pointing in Michael 's direction , its body still perpendicular to the water . Long red tongue came out and flicked away the droplets on its white chin . The plan ? What plan ? Stupid , Tillman , real dumb , Michael was thinking . The lodge was a forty-  | second sprint up a flight of steep , rough steps , or longer via a jungle route , and a Bengal in full stride could cover a hundred yards in four seconds . If the tiger wanted him , Michael could do nothing . Running would be pointless . And pathetic . Somehow , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why when he thought back on it . He just was n't . In fact , all the time he was thinking how serious wildlife watchers would give up their butterfly nets for life if they could have this experience . Talk about a Saw-It ! merit badge , talk about counting coup . A lot of folks were out there practicing a kind of visual banditry and grunted sourly when the stagecoach did n't stop . It had stopped here , in the fog , at dawn . Michael began to take pleasure in just staring back at the tiger , in the simple purity of contemplating its existence , in knowing not everything wild and strong had been snuffed out by condos and shopping malls . There was something good and exhilarating about that , about knowing that creatures who crawled toward trenches or went bump against your shutters in the darkness or stared at you from a misty shoreline in south India were out there , and they cared nothing for your passing joys and sorrows , and they were free to return to the jungle when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water , looked at Michael again , then shambled down the shore in the opposite direction . At fifty yards it turned to look at Michael once more , looked at him for a long time . At a hundred yards the big cat angled off into the jungle . The sun ran up its flag hard and bright , and the fog lifted .  | " Good morning , Michael . " It was Jellie , and Jaya , carrying cups of hot tea for themselves and a big cup of coffee for the tiger expert who was busy sewing a merit badge on his sleeve : Saw It ! Michael said nothing about the tiger , thinking they might feel sorry about having missed it and thereby spoiling a first-class sunrise for them . When he told them later they were both sorry and glad  --  sorry they 'd missed it , glad they were n't there . " Michael " ? her gray eyes were full of good , loving signals as they looked at him ? " we did n't talk about travel plans . Jaya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can you stay ? " Stay ? He 'd have slugged it out with the Bengal for the privilege . " Jellie , I 'm free until mid January . My return flight is January twelfth . What 's your program , as they say in India ? " Jaya smiled . " Well ... " Jellie was a little hesitant . He sensed it was money . " Let me suggest something . You 're looking at a guy who lives in a cheap apartment , drives a thirty-year-old motorcycle and a fifteen-year-old Dodge Dart , and makes a passable salary . If the two of you feel like it , let 's travel , go where we want to go . Take the canal boats through the Kerala estuaries , lay around up on the Goa coast for a while , ride the steamer up to Bombay and stay in the Taj Hotel . My treat and no holds barred . " " That will cost a lot of money . " She bent over and kissed him good morning . He whispered , " We can work it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She rolled her eyes . " My new profession now Slow Waltz in Cedar Bend 177  | becomes clear . " Then Jellie laughed , and Jaya laughed , too , though she seemed a little unsure of why she was laughing . But Michael thought he knew  --  she was laughing because her mother was laughing , because her mother was happy and loved a man and was n't afraid to let her see it . She 'd figure it out after a while . And they did that , traveled . Stayed on at the Lake Palace for three more nights , then went off to Kerala to see the famous Chinese fishing nets and stayed in the Malabar Hotel , where they swam in the pool and had late suppers served on white linen by the bay . They hit Goa and lounged on the beach , took the steamer to Bombay and checked into the Taj Hotel for five days . Flew up to Jaipur to see the Pink City and took a camel safari into the Rajasthani desert . On January 5 they put Jaya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jellie and Michael a week to themselves . They spent it in Pondicherry , staying with Innkeeper Maigrit ( " Ah , monsieur , you found her , I see . May I politely say she was worth the search " ) and taking their evening meals in the small restaurants of Pondicherry . They went far up the beach one afternoon and made love in the sand , then swain naked in the warm Bay of Bengal and made love again in the water . And Michael lectured at the college , paying his debt to Dr. Ramani . Jellie was moved by the fact Michael had booked his return flight for the twelfth of January , that he 'd been prepared to spend over seven weeks looking for her . He said , and meant it , " If I had n't found you by the sixth , I was going to call home and tell them to find a substitute for the spring semester . I was Jellie ,  | I truly mean this  --  fully prepared to go on with my knapsack until I found you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On January 12 they rode British Airways toward Heathrow , reading , laughing , holding hands . Then serious at times , preparing themselves for laying all of this in front of Jimmy . Between London and Chicago , somewhere over the Greenland ice pack , Jellie leaned her head against Michael 's shoulder . He looked at the gray eyes , noticed something pensive in them . " What is it , Jellie ? " " I was just thinking . People once called Dhiren the Tiger of Morning . ' " She went to sleep then , resting against him . He gently fished a notebook out of his pocket and wrote , " The Tiger of Morning lives forever . "  | James Lee Braden III was a middle-grade rationalist . What could not be explained in terms of empirical evidence did not exist .

Induction and tentative conclusion : 180 Robert James Waller  | Maybe Jellie Braden and Michael Tillman were more than friends . January evening 1982 , conclusion no longer tentative . Jimmy said he understood how Jellie and Michael would be attracted to each other . His primary concern was , in his words , " how we all carry on from here . " He seemed almost relieved , more worried about style than substance . Jellie was less rational and quite a lot less stylish than her husband at that moment . She 'd been married to Jimmy Braden for eleven years , that counted for something . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry she was , how it was not right to behave as she had . Jimmy eventually said , " Our decision to marry was probably a good one at the time , but people change . There 's no point living with choices made by people who were different eleven years ago than they are now . " Jellie gathered herself and her things and moved in with Michael . They painted his old apartment and gradually converted it into something both of them could tolerate . The Shadow stayed in the living room . That was not open for debate or compromise . Jellie did suggest a dropcloth to protect the nice oak flooring from greasy tools . Michael smiled and said it was a large concession but agreed . He rolled back into teaching , dog-paddling his way through the wash of sideways looks and gossip that ultimately became a minor part of the university saga . Jellie retrieved her maiden name , finished her M.A. , and was accepted in the anthropology Ph.D . program . And Jimmy ? He went away .

Eleanor Markham was appalled and forever would view Michael as a social misfit and home wrecker . She was especially appalled at his travel habits and happened to be looking out the window of her Syracuse home one afternoon when the Black Shadow rolled up her driveway . The Shadow was no longer an amusing abstraction sitting in some lunatic professor 's living room . It was real now , and her forty-four-year-old daughter was riding behind the lunatic . Probably it was Jellie 's leather jacket , boots , and mirrored sunglasses that got her . It 'd been a long life , and she 'd hoped for something better . Michael and Jellie 's father escaped to the trout streams . Leonard Markham never said harsh words about anybody , and he mentioned Jimmy only once in Michael 's presence .

The Coachman landed soft as you please below a big rock where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fly , and said , " Jim Braden was afraid of water . Can you imagine that , Michael ?

Jellie and Michael traveled to India once a year . In 1984 they brought Jaya back to meet her grandparents . Afterward the three of them visited Michael 's  | mother , who was confined to a nursing home in Rapid City . She was old and pretty wobbly , but sentient most of the time .

He would go away from Jellie , sometimes on the Shadow , sometimes only in his mind . And she resented that . " People are n't motorcycles , Michael .

And make sure you remember Dhiren and how happy you were with him , and how unhappy you were with Jimmy Braden . You once told me Jimmy was so conciliatory and ambivalent it damn near drove you crazy . You 're a strong woman in a lot of ways , Jellie Markham , but you like your men a little wild and untamed . I will , however  --  and being completely aware of my failings and general unworthiness  --  extend my offer of marriage once again , as I do almost weekly .

The men she truly cared for made her happy in some ways , unhappy in others . Still looking at her shoe , she said , " As I 've mentioned before , being married twice is enough .

Maybe sometime I 'll surprise you and say yes . ' " " The offer remains open . How about two fingers ' worth of Jack Daniel 's , a bath , and then the kind of reconciliation we seem to do best .

" Right now I 'm getting a lot more interested in moving to the bedroom . " She leaned her head back and shook it . " UUhhh , men ! You 're all nuttier'n hell . " Michael kissed her long and sweet , on her mouth , on both her breasts , and ran his tongue along her throat . " Not all of us are nutty . . . only the ones you like . " Jellie received her doctorate in 1987 . Michael was allowed to attend the ceremony in full academic regalia , though his robe and soft , six-pointed cap , which had lain unused for years , needed two runs at the dry cleaners before they were presentable . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he damn near fainted with pride , knowing how much it meant to her . Michael threw a small party for her at the apartment and had a bottle of champagne all to himself , grinning while he sat on the Shadow and 186 Robert James Waller  | watched her gray eyes as people congratulated her . Jellie Markham had become whole , professionally , at least . Later that evening when the guests had stumbled back to wherever guests go when they leave , she came out of the bathroom with her academic gown and mortarboard on . Michael was still sitting on the Shadow , barefoot in T-shirt and jeans , a bottle of champagne balanced on the gas tank . He said , " Dr. Markham , I presume . " She grinned that old salacious grin of hers , the one she put on when it was time for serious matters of the flesh , then parted the robe and showed him she was wearing nothing beneath it . " Dr. Markham is now ready for her graduation present , if Dr. Tillman is prepared . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splendid fashion with Michael straddling the Shadow and Jellie straddling Michael , Miles on the tape deck . Jellie chewed on his ear and whispered " Vroom , vroom , " while she moved slowly up and down with quiet , blissful intensity on the motorcycle man . Michael 's mother died in 1988 . A realtor called eight months later and said he had a buyer for the little house in Custer . Classes started in a week , but Michael cranked up the Shadow and headed out . It all went smoothly , and he brought the Shadow back toward Cedar Bend , starting with the Black Hills and staying on secondary highways for the entire distance . He ran into heavy rains a little east of the Missouri River , but he was short of time and pushing hard , his yellow slicker flapping in the wind . Night caught him at the Iowa border . He looked down at his old friend , patting the gas tank . The engine was bolted directly to the frame ,  | and he could feel the vibrations at the level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit , big guy , see what you 're made of here on your thirty-seventh birthday . " The Shadow responded and ran like a black cat over the wet pavement , its headlights sweeping across woodlands on the curves . It happened in the hills east of Sioux City . The semi slid around a blind curve , drifting into the other lane . Michael 's visor was a little fogged , and his night vision was n't what it used to be . He blinked , then squinted hard . The truck was moving fast in the hands of a sleepy driver hammering eighty thousand pounds of vehicle and its load of tractor parts toward Omaha . The driver came to full alert as the truck skidded , fought to control his rig , and saw the yellow slicker fluttering a hundred feet straight ahead of where his hood ornament pointed . Michael was blinded by the lights , truck closing and no way to lay the Shadow down and slide . He thought of Jellie and tigers . For some reason he thought of Jellie and tigers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road and into the trees at seventymiles an hour . A yellow blur rocketing 30 feet into the forest . . . 100 feet . . . 200 feet . . . steering and braking and running the maze in a wild flash of tigers and Jellie and the way she looked at him in those times , holding her breath , eyes wide and her breasts and belly coming up to meet the tiger and him , Michael Tillman , and he smiled , and for a moment , just a wild and fleeting moment that became vanishingly small , he believed he was going to make it . Until the yellow blur became a butterfly gone . 188 Robert James Waller  | In those stretches when he was conscious , Michael could hear the hum of life-support systems to which he was fastened . Sort of a faint and steady background noise . Sometimes a certain machine kicked in and the noise would get louder , which he did n't like but which he could n't do anything about . He was pretty well beat up . The doctors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two broken arms , compound fracture of one leg , internal injuries . He thought he was dying , so did the doctors , and he tried to come to grips with that fact , hanging on until Jellie could get there , hanging on to see her again . He concentrated on Jellie 's face , formed it up cool and clean in his mind , got her to smile for him , and he was still around in the morning . Outside his room at the desk guarding the intensive care unit , he vaguely heard a panicked voice . " Where 's Michael Tillman , please , I 'm his wife . " His wife  --  he 'd never thought of Jellie that way . She bent over him : " Oh , Michael . . . Michael . I came as fast as I could . Michael , get better , and I 'll take care of you forever . Do n't worry , it 'll all be fine . " " Jellie , touch my face . " His throat was wrapped around a tube , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoarse one , but she heard him and stroked his cheek . He felt tears , big tears , coming out of both eyes , his eyes . It was n't self-pity . . . well , maybe it was . He did n't know , did n't matter . He was feeling the touch of her hand on his face , thinking about how much he loved her and that they 'd never make their old , sweet laughing love again , and that he 'd never take her out to Heron Lake on the back of the Shadow again , and Slow Waltz in Cedar Bend 189  | that they 'd never sit on the veranda of the Lake Palace Hotel again , looking for tigers he knew were out there because he saw one once on a foggy morning when the world was beginning to turn his way . Jellie was crying but trying to hide it from him . He floated in and out of consciousness for days , but finally the old body decided to give him another chance . He blinked open his eyes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looked up at him , smiling . " Welcome back , Michael . " In a few weeks Michael was on his feet , with Jellie 's help , looking like a clumsy snowman , in his casts . He was not a patient patient ; his mind called for action while his body wanted rest . After the casts were off , Jellie would come home from the university , where she was working as a temporary instructor , and find him attempting push-ups or sitting bent over his desk chair , trying to make the muscles in his arms learn to type again . " For God 's sake , Michael , I 'm doing all I can do to get you better , and you 're not helping . I have classes and shopping and you , and that 's a full load . You have to cooperate a little , take things slow as the doctor said . And do n't look at me in that little boy cranky way of yours ; I 'm too busy for nonsense . " " I feel inadequate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here drawing disability pay . " " Think of it as if you were practicing the jumpshot , Michael . Invest now , get the benefits later . " " Too logical , nurse Jellie , too logical . " " You 're the logician , Michael , except when it comes to yourself . "  | " That puts me in the great mainstream , right ? Only time I 've ever been there , and I do n't like the feel of it . " " Well , you can like it or not like it . I 'm going to the library . I have six hours of preparation to do for the survey course . " She put on her coat and stomped out . Two hours later she called him from a pay phone in the library . " You okay ? " " Yep . The little boy is no longer cranky and will attempt to remain as such . Sorry for the hassle . Christ , I did this to myself , and now I 'm externalizing the results of my own stupidity on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , really I do . But it 's not easy sometimes . You understand that , do n't you ? " " Yep again . Do you really have six hours of class preparation ? " " No . I was just escaping from the Walnut Street rehab ward for a while . I think I 'll come home and fix us something to eat . " " Wrong . I 'll rustle up some soup or its equivalent , have it bubbling when you get here . " Eventually , Michael 's ability to type came back , ideas started to form , and the computer screen glowed blue in the evenings . After three months he could walk outside by himself and started jogging slowly a few weeks afterward . There was laughter again , and there was loving . But living with Michael 's intensity was not easy . Jellie had known it before the accident , and that intensity came back even stronger as he recovered . It was constant , unrelenting , a never-ending push toward frontiers of the mind and spirit , frontiers he redefined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so the chase could go on . Michael chased frontiers and Jellie helped him chase the things he lost because his mind was always somewhere else , never paying attention to where he put car keys or checks or his latest draft of an article . " Michael , you do n't look ' well . You riffle around through a stack of something or shove things here and there on top of the refrigerator and think you 've really searched . After that , you yell , Jellie , have you seen . . . ? ' " " I use the lost horse method for finding things . " He was eating an apple and had just finished complaining that he could n't find last month 's paycheck , which he was taking to the bank as soon as he located his car keys and found his gloves . " What 's the lost horse method ? " He was holding the apple between his teeth and scrounging around on top of the refrigerator , talking through the apple at the same time . He sounded as if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a horse , go where you saw him last and start there . " " What if you took the horse somewhere , to start with , and forgot where he was before you took him somewhere else ? Your system would n't work , would it ? " " All my methods are flawed . " He grinned , flipping the half-eaten apple over his shoulder from behind his back and catching it with his other hand . " Help me find the goddamn check , Jellie , so I can then look for my goddamned keys after which I 'll search for my goddamned gloves . Please , Jellie . You 're looking at a disabled searcher . All men have 192 Robert James Waller  | the disability ; it 's another one of those many flaws in the Y chromosome . " Jellie continued working as a temporary instructor at the university and enjoyed the teaching . Michael became more and more unhappy with the constraints of an academic bureaucracy that operated , as he saw it , for its own benefit , for its own survival and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delight instead in her students and her own research . This was new territory for her ; Michael was more than two decades into it . In 1990 , after talking it over , they moved to White Bear Canyon . Jellie had misgivings about the move , about surrendering her own professional life to follow the drift of Michael 's ways . But he had been unhappy at the university , and there was the possibility of a teaching position for her at Spearfish State . Life in the canyon was quiet and pleasant , but Jellie was restless . Though Michael worked alone and enjoyed it , Jellie needed an organization , a place where she could teach and do conventional research in her field . A year later Jellie went to India alone . The birth of Jaya 's second child was a complicated delivery , and she needed help afterward . Jellie stayed on longer than she 'd intended . Two months , three months . India starting pulling on her again , Elsa Markham 's genes turning her in directions that pointed a long way from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a difficult man . A French architect from Auroville invited her out to dinner . He was handsome , worldly . She went with him once to the Alliance Francaise but declined the next time he asked . It did n't Slow Waltz in Cedar Bend 193  | seem fair to Michael . The architect continued to call her . He sent flowers , left notes tacked to her door . Michael knew nothing about the Frenchman , but he was worried . He called and asked , " When are you coming back ? " His voice was pensive . " I do n't know , " she said in a flat , noncommittal way . " There 's a job for you at Spearfish State beginning next fall . They called two days ago . " " I do n't know right now . That 's all I can say . " Spearfish State versus the excitement of a cosmopolitan life in Pondicherry .

It was simple , uncomplicated , living this way . No problems . And she was near Jaya and the grandchildren , which enabled her to do penance for the mother she never had been . The university in Pondicherry offered her a part-time job , and she almost went to bed with the Frenchman on a night when the sweet smell of jasmine rode on slow winds from the Bay of Bengal , but she pulled back at the last minute . She was falling into something different , another life that seemed far off now . The next time she would n't pull back . Michael called again . His voice was cooler than she remembered . He 'd lived alone before , he could do it again , she knew that . He 'd come to India after her once ; he would n't do it a second time . When they said good-bye , his voice changed , got a little soft and sad . 194 Robert James Waller  | " I miss you , Jellie/JahLAY . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under-stand . In the white sun of an India morning , the seawall at Pondicherry curved into the distance and looked like something from Mediterranean lands . Come evening , the locals strolled there while the streets and buildings of the city breathed out the heat of the day just past . After talking with Michael , Jellie walked to the seawall and sat there for a long time . A slice of yellow moon hung thirty degrees up , off in the general direction of Burma . Back home she went to a mirror and looked at herself . Fifty-one . The Frenchman said she looked no more than forty . Men still turned to watch her when she passed , and that was good , she supposed . She brushed her long black hair , straightened her scarf , and returned to the mirror . She whispered , " Jellie Markham . . . Jellie . . . the song is almost finished . Just what the hell are you doing here when the only man you truly care for is half a world away ? " Two days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high country near Thekkady . Dhiren seemed far back . Twenty-five years had passed since that day of blood and fear in the dust now covering her feet . The afternoon breeze lifted her hair while she sat quietly on a log and remembered her warriorpoet , remembered him and the way he touched her , remembered him running for the trees . That evening she visited an old woman named Sudhana . They ate simple food and talked of other times .  | Chitra Dhavale rode with Jellie to the airport in Madras . " I 'll miss you , Jellie , but I am glad you are going back . It 's the right thing . " " What a strange , messy life it 's been , Chitra . Irresponsible , too . " Jellie had tears in her eyes . They were standing near the gate to Jellie 's plane . Chitra put her arms around her and said , " Yes ... strange and messy . . . and irresponsible in some ways , I suppose . All of that . . . and quite wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's doing the measuring and by what standards . But you at least know what it 's like to come into high plumage and catch the southern winds . Most of us do n't and never will . It 's a lucky person who can have a single great love in her life . You 've had two . One when you were a girl , and the other when you became a woman . Jellie smiled then . " And one was a warrior-poet and the other is a motorcycle man . God help us all . " They laughed together while she dried her tears , and forty minutes later Air India lifted off . Chitra Dhavale watched morning light flash from the 747 's wings as it turned toward South Dakota . Jellie had not told Michael she was returning and rode the airport limo by herself from Rapid City through the Black Hills . On the front porch of the cabin in White Bear Canyon was a disassembled motorcycle , the Shadow II . Michael had found it six months before at a convention of motorcycle enthusiasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place of the old Shadow destroyed in the accident , he 183 among the Iroquois , ended up with no reservation in New York State . Their efforts to regain their land have been going on almost continually since 1795 when chiefs sold sixty thousand acres to New York State for $i , 800 and a small annuity . Within six months , the state resold the land to settlers for $292,000 ( much of it became the military tracts ) . The Cayuga have pointed out repeatedly that the state violated federal law in negotiating and implementing the treaties and that the treaties were never ratified by Congress as required . All that remains of the annuity is a box of muslin sent annually by the U.S. government via UPS  --  every Cayuga receives a yard and a half of cloth . Many Cayuga went to Canada or Oklahoma ; a small number remain in New York as guests of the Seneca on their reservation near Buffalo . They live there as second-class citizens , without a vote or the right to inherit land . No matter how long they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passes matrilineally . If a Seneca man marries a Cayuga woman , their children are Cayuga , and when the Seneca father dies , the Cayuga children have no right to stay on the land they were raised on . The tensions of modern reservation life have led to incivilities very much at odds with the spirit of the League . Previously , intermarriage between tribes was an ideal  --  marrying " across the fire " was seen as a way to perpetually reknit the League 's alliance . At the end of each condolence ceremony , in fact , the League is symbolically rebound by the women crossing over to dance with men of their opposite moiety . Now there are cases of Cayuga widows being cast out of their Seneca homes . The situation of the Cayuga worsens whenever there 's a crisis over Seneca land . And since World War II , there 's been an almost continual sense of crisis on Iroquois reservations in New York . A dam project ate up part of the Onondaga reservation south of Syracuse in the late forties ; the St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroyed their fishing industry . The Niagara Power Project , or-  | chestrated by Robert Moses , claimed an eighth of the Tuscarora reserve north of Buffalo . And most shockingly , the Kinzua Dam flooded the entire Cornplanter Tract of the Seneca 's Allegany reservation in southwestern New York  --  a full third of the reservation . The Kinzua project was first dreamed up in 1927 as a means of flood control along the Allegheny , downriver in Pennsylvania . It was authorized by Congress in 1941 , put on hold , then taken up again in the mid-fifties by the Army Corps of Engineers . The Seneca argued that the plan was a direct violation of the Canandaigua Treaty of 1794 , which had established the reservation as Seneca property and promised that " the United States will never claim the same , nor disturb the Seneca Nation , nor any of the Six Nations , or of their Indian friends residing thereon and united with them , in the free use and enjoyment thereof .... " Seneca president George Heron testified before Congress that " the truth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington read the 1794 Treaty before he signed it , and that he meant exactly what he wrote . " Nevertheless , a series of court decisions , culminating in a 1959 Supreme Court ruling , upheld the government 's right to condemn a section of the reservation by eminent domain . The flooding problems and power needs of Pennsylvania residents were to be solved by flooding the most fertile bottomlands of the reservation . The project had a kind of momentum hard to stop in this country . Once it was a line item in a budget , once so many hours had been invested in its design , not even TVA expert Arthur Morgan 's testimony that in fact another location for the reservoir would be more economical , and would avoid taking Seneca land , could brake it . Most of the planning had gone on under Eisenhower , but it was Kennedy who wrote to the Seneca in 1961 that it was " not possible to halt the construction of Kinzua Dam . "  | The prospect of the land loss had hung over the heads of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the homes of 130 families ( one-third of the reservation 's population ) as well as the Cold Spring Longhouse , religious center of the reservation . The families were relocated from their rural homes to two dense , suburban-style housing tracts . The longhouse fire was moved in a nine-hour ceremony . But the floodwater permanently obliterated the reservation 's cemetery , its monument to Cornplanter  --  first in the nation dedicated to an Indian  --  and the sacred places where prophet Handsome Lake had had his visions and begun to preach , revitalizing the Longhouse Religion during the agonizing early days of reservation life . An ominous rider on the bill authorizing Kinzua also established a committee to meet with the Bureau of Indian Affairs to " think ahead to termination " ? the ultimate dismantling of the reservation . Most believe that the loss of the land base would mean the end of the Seneca as a nation . Laurence Hauptman wrote in 1986 that " Even today , more than twenty years after the flooding of their homeland began , Seneca elders have difficulty speaking of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Seneca elders break down and cry , expressing their anguish in recalling the years 1957 to 1964 . To them , the relocation and removal of Seneca families from the take area ' was their second Trail of Tears . ' ... " The displacement of Native Americans is catastrophic in a way white Americans do n't fully understand , because as well as the usual emotional attachments to home , and the dependence of traditional Indians on a known environment for healing herbs and food , there is a strong religious dimension in their relation to their place . The dislocation from sacred space  --  from where revelations occurred and where ancestors are buried  --  profoundly damages spiritual life . The effects on Navajo following recent forced relocations near Big Mountain , Arizona , have been  | poignantly documented . " Relocation is a word that does not exist in the Navajo language , " explains an elder . " To be relocated is to disappear and never be seen again . " The displacement of spiritually rooted communities like the Navajo and Seneca " is about the worst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , " says Thayer Scudder . " Judges and members of Con-gress  --  as highly educated and mobile individuals  --  are probably almost totally unaware of the impact .... " There 's no consolation for the Navajo in the new homes some have been given , as there was n't for the Seneca in the new buildings that $15 million in compensation money made possible . And then there were suggestions like turning part of the Allegany reservation into a living museum of Iroquoia . Perhaps such a notion lingers behind the reservations in general . We 've created them to the proper scale  --  two out of three are smaller than Disney World . The experience of Kinzua radicalized a generation of young Iroquois and made them leaders in the Red Power movement . Their militancy , along with the continual diminishment of the reservations and the pressing need for more land , led to the assertive revival of Iroquois land claims in the seventies . The Oneida pressed their case first and won a Supreme Court ruling in 1974 giving them the right to sue in federal court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their initial treaties and won an $8 million settlement . The Cayuga , though , are determined to settle only for land . Their renewed quest to regain their territory was at first met with incredulity or indifference . Later , as the case was treated seriously by the Carter administration , much of the local population reacted with alarm and vehement racism . People said they thought they 'd gotten rid of the Indians once before  --  why were they coming back with this " surprise attack " ? Eleven thousand property owners were in the claimed area . From the start , though , the Cayuga made it clear they wanted to negotiate a  | settlement rather than sue and that they were prepared to accept parcels of public land rather than displace home owners . But local hysteria at having a reservation anywhere in the area unraveled a modest settlement that made it all the way to the floor of Congress in 1980 . It would have given the Cayuga Sampson State Park and a grazing area farther down the lake , 5,400 acres in all , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreement , the Cayuga filed suit in U.S. district court for the return of more than 64,000 acres of land and $350 million in trespass damages . The claimed land flanks Cayuga Lake and cuts a wide swath up the state from Pennsylvania to Lake Ontario ? the whole of traditional Cayuga territory . It includes the city of Ithaca and prosperous small towns like Seneca Falls and Lewis Henry Morgan 's hometown of Aurora , as well as numerous farms and resort cottages . A second settlement , proposed in 1984 , would give the Cayuga nearly 8,500 acres of public land and considerably more money than the first offer . Local recalcitrance continues to stall that plan ( " I 'd rather have a nuclear power plant there than Indians , " declared one angry town councilman ) . Meanwhile , the legal process slowly but surely strengthens the Cayuga 's case . The original treaties have now been declared invalid by the courts , and the objections that the Cayuga had abandoned the land before selling it ( when chased off by Sullivan and Clinton , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have also been dismissed . Lawyers are advising the counties to settle . There are only four hundred registered Cayuga remaining in New York State . With their families , they constitute about a thousand people . Chief Frank Bonamie , spokesman for the tribe and long involved in the claims case , lives in Ithaca at the south end of Cayuga Lake , the only registered Cayuga living in native territory . He thinks about two or three hundred people from the tribe would immediately settle on a new reservation . Several industries are poised to locate there too . The biggest factor for  | the families who would choose to come is having their own school and preserving their language . When I ask him if his own grown children would settle there , he confesses they ca n't ? their mother is n't a Cayuga . There 's a sad irony in that  --  in the desire to preserve the matrilineal tradition , many people of passionate commitment must be excluded . The thought of a reservation at Sampson , so near my own front door , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things right , let us make our peace , even more so than Ganondagan , which , though evocative , is not a lived-in community . With the local natives back approximately in their place , we could together concentrate on the crucial matter of preserving this local environment , a concern embedded in Iroquois principles . Despite their principles , New York 's Iroquois reservations have hardly been spared environmental degradation , and the Cayuga reservation would be at the front door of the Seneca Army Depot , a less-than-desirable location being all anyone is even half-willing to cede . Iroquois reservations , in fact , seem to have been targeted for pollution . The Environmental Protection Agency is currently trying to clean up a twenty-five-acre dump on the Onondaga reservation that has been discovered to contain more than a thousand barrels of toxic chemicals and a tract the size of a football field eight feet deep in medical waste . Conditions at the Mohawk 's Akwesasne ( St. Regis ) reservation up on the St. Lawrence Seaway are even more appalling . Alcoa has had a factory a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early thirties , serious pollution problems were already evident . After the seaway opened , Reynold 's opened an aluminum plant one mile from Akwesasne and began dumping fluorides into the air at the rate of three hundred pounds per hour . Cattle promptly fell ill . The livestock industry has been virtually wiped out . General Motors subsequently set up a facility fewer than a thousand yards from several Mohawk homes and used  | the river shoreline to dispose of PCB-laced sludge . That dump , separated from the reservation by only a chain-link fence , is now on the Superfund cleanup list . Investigators of local wildlife turned up the highest level of PCB contamination ever found in a mammal ? 11,522 parts per million in a shrew ( 3 parts per million is deemed unfit for human consumption ) . It 's now unadvisable for the Mohawk to eat anything locally grown or caught . The most ironic emblem of the desecration of the reservation is that local turtles have become unwitting monitors of toxic contamination . For the Iroquois and many other American tribes , the turtle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is mythically Turtle Island , perched on the turtle 's reliably sturdy back . From the scientist 's point of view , the turtle 's being omnivorous , relatively sedentary , and long-lived means that the toxins in its tissues are a good indicator of local conditions . The turtles captured and analyzed at Akwesasne were so riddled with PCBs , insecticides , and other contaminants that their flesh qualified as toxic waste . In Iroquois mythology , when the turtle dies , the world dies . Conditions like these have inevitably led to despair and internal division on the reservations . With their traditional subsistence economy destroyed , residents have had to turn instead to marketing their tax-free advantage , selling gas and cigarettes to the white population ( " We Scalp Prices , Not People " ) . Most divisively , they 've also opened gambling halls , an issue of such controversy among the Mohawk that it 's often flared in violence . Among the Oneida , infighting has meant that in spite of legal victories , they still have n't progressed toward establishing their own reservation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centuries of damage have perniciously accumulated . There 's a prayer of eulogy sung as the Iroquois gather for  | the condolence ceremony after a chief 's death . Its environmental metaphors almost seem to have foretold where things were headed : Woe ! Hearken ! We are diminished . The cleared land becomes a thicket The clear places are deserted ! Alas ! Woe ! Woe ! They are in their graves , They who established it , They who established the Great League . Yet they declared That the Great League Would endure forever . But woe ! The League has grown old . Thus are we miserable . What is sung for each dead chief can now be sung for the League as a whole . They are all in their graves  --  generations of Cayuga and Seneca as well as revivalists and first feminists  --  but their voices filter through . Arising out of this same soil as they did , they mingle for me in a poignant fugue I 'd hear nowhere but here .  | WELCOME ( AGAIN ) TO GENEVA- " Lake Trout Capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our local welcome sign , the sign that peddles the image of locale , the commodity of place .

" That vulnerability is evident in the self-deprecating humor of many on the periphery . " You Are Entering the Loneliest Town on the Loneliest Road in America " ? Eureka , Nevada . " Humility " and " humor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soil , the earth  --  and to the human being , who is at root , linguistically , an earthling . " The soil is man 's intelligence , " says Wallace Stevens . " The poetry of earth is never dead " ? Keats . The poetry of place learns from the earth , is humble and good-humored before it .
