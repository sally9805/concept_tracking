The Bush Administration 's July 1989 ban on the importation of rapid-fire assault-style rifles always seemed ineffectual . It mainly protected domestic gunmakers from competition . Last week the ban seemed still more illusory . The Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms announced that it could not prevent imports of guns like AK-47s if they were redesigned to remove military-style features such as large-capacity magazines , flash suppressors and bayonets . Such changes may make the rifles less deadly , but buyers can turn the guns into people killers with easy-to-get kits . Manufacturers , says Josh Sugarmann , director of the Firearms Policy Project , have " left the guts of an assault weapon . " Imports of modified rifles have not begun , but one company plans to start soon .
