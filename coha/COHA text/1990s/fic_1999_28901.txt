The Wedding Bargain Chapter One The Opening GambitSpring , 1818 " You , my lord , are a rake and a rogue . A scoundrel . " Pandora Effington leveled a gaze filled with every vile thought she could marshal at Maximillian Wells , the Earl of Trent . " in short , sir , you are a beast . " Trent stepped into the secluded salon , within easy distance of the crowded ballroom of the Marquess and Marchioness of Rockingham , yet far enough away to provide a discreet meeting place for a private assignation . " Am I ? " " You are indeed . You should probably be shot . " " I scarcely know what to say . " He snapped the doors closed behind him . A twinge of apprehension stabbed at her . Perhaps it was not a good idea to be alone with a rake , a rogue , a scoundrel , and a beast . " Except , of course , " amusement glimmered in his eye , " thank you . " " Thank you ? " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The comers of his mouth twitched as if he struggled to hold back a grin . " It is not often that one receives such a compliment . " " It was in no way intended as a compliment . " In the space of a few moments , Trent had managed to turn the conversation completely around . Why was she surprised ? She should have expected that he would n't believe her comments were criticism of the highest order . His reputation preceded him . ' Trent leaned against the carved fireplace mantel in a manner at once casual and challenging . " Perhaps it was not intended as such , but it was indeed high praise . Although I must admit , I did not expect flattery when you lured me in here . " " Oh ? " Pandora was never particularly given to caution , but the same instinct that kept her from straying too far past the bounds of proper behavior warned her now to take care . Stiff , curiosity was as integral to her existence as the beat of her heart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brow . Pandora laughed in spite of her annoyance . He did indeed have an inflated opinion of himself . " Surely , you did not presume  --  " Trent nodded , a slow smile spread ing across his face . " What would you have me believe ? I am enticed into a private setting  --  " " I did not entice you . " "  --  For reasons completely unknown to me  --  " " I intend to make those perfectly clear . " "  --  By a woman who is no longer a green girl , and by all accounts should know what she is about . I believe this is your eighth season , is it not ? " It should not have bothered her , this reminder that in a life filled with the excitement of following her own rules , her inability or unwillingness to marry was a failure in the eyes of most . Yet it did . Always . Her amusement vanished and she gritted her teeth . " Seventh . " " Forgive me . One tends to lose track when a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . the term ' young ' is relative , do n't you think ? " " I am barely four-and-twenty . Hardly in my dotage . " " As old as that , " he murmured . " One would consider most women of that age past their prime and firmly on the shelf . " " If I am on the shelf , it 's because I prefer to be there . " She settled on the edge of a perfectly appointed settee in the perfectly appointedsaIon and adopted a calm demeanor that belied her irritation at his condescending attitude . " I quite value my independence . " " Oh ? " Skepticism rang in his tone . I thought the wish of every unmarried young woman of notable family was to wed , preferably to a noble title and nobler income . " She raised her chin . " It has never been my particular desire to marry . " " Come now , my dear . " The expression on his face verged on pity and her hand itched to slap it off . " One would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticed the enthusiasm with which you 've thrown yourself into the festivities of the marriage mart the past eight seasons . " " Six . " Was he deliberately baiting her , or was he really as sanctimonious as he sounded ? " The number scarcely matters ; suffice it to say , it is considerable . If you are not interested in marriage , as you claim , what are you interested in ? " He paused as if struck by the answer to his own question . " Forgive me , I should have realized . " " Realized ... what ? " She did not like the knowing look in his eye . In two strides he was by her side , towering over her in a most disconcerting way . Quickly she rose to her feet . He stood nearly a foot taller than she , and his eyes , gray and deep , gazed down at her in an impertinent and assessing manner . No , she did not like the look in his eyes at all . Unease fluttered in her stomach . He stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never cared about silly edicts before , at once she comprehended their worth . " I take pride in being an intelligent man , but tonight I seem to have forgotten myself . " He took her hand , turned it palm up , and lightly brushed his lips against the sensitive skin of her wrist , revealed by an unbuttoned gap in her glove . Her breath caught . " I understand completely now . " " You do ? " Why did n't she ? She too prided herself on her intelligence . Yet at the moment she could do little more than wonder why she had never before realized gray was quite an intriguing shade for a man 's eyes . " Indeed . " He nodded soberly . " While in most circumstances the daughter of a viscount would have to depend on marriage to secure her future , all of London knows your father has seen fit to ensure you not only a substantial inheritance , but funding enough to provide you with independence even now .
