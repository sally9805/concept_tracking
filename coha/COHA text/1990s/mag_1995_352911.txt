On any other day , the obscenely long list unwinding from Michigan Governor John Engler 's hands would not be one he would be eager to display . It seemed to extend forever . Aid to Families with Dependent Children was one entry ; food stamps was another . In all , it contained 335 items , each a federal program . To Engler and his gubernatorial colleagues , each also represented a different federal bureaucracy to which he had to kowtow ; a different process in which he had no say ; and a specific amount of money he had to pay out of his state 's treasury , whether he liked it or not . It was a Governor 's nightmare list . <P> And yet Engler was grinning broadly . He was parading the specially prepared parchment not as a catalog of woes , but the way a general might display his enemy 's head on a pike . Welfare entitlements , he announced , were dead . Over the weekend , ' ' he later joked , we went through the denial , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diagnosis seem farfetched . <P> The National Governors ' Association came to Washington for its annual meeting last week ; but in contrast with their usual posture as supplicants , its members arrived as conquerors . Both Newt Gingrich and Bill Clinton paid them court . Their favorite piece of legislation , a restriction of the Federal Government 's power to impose rules and make the states pay for them ( otherwise known as unfunded mandates ) , became the first major chunk of the Gingrichian program to pass both houses of Congress . Clinton , for his part , announced that he was reducing 271 mostly unilateral federal programs to 27 performance partnerships ' ' with the Governors . Of Clinton 's proposal , Engler said it was a good start . He knew Congress would outdo that . <P> Yes , 1995 is a fine year for the states , and perhaps something more . On one level , it appeared that the Governors were simply being freed to govern . But the repeated pledges of federal leaders and a blizzard of state-friendly legislation suggested something larger . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to either the Jeffersonian ideals of local governance and part-time legislators ( if you are a fan ) or the social miseries of the 1920s and pollution of the 1970s ( if you are not ) . Said Geoffrey Garin , a Democratic pollster : This is the opening debate over the radical Republican agenda . ' ' Senate Budget Committee chairman Pete Domenici 's analysis was simultaneously more sanguine and more portentous : it might mark a change in how we define the role of the Federal Government in the next century .
