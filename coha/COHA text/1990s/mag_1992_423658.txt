Section : REAL ESTATE How to get more value for your dollar while guarding against unreliable contractors . <p> Alva and Greg Campbell had their first doubts about their contractor when they noticed that the flooring in the new downstairs hallway looked familiar . Upstairs , to their shock , they found a large hole in the center of the bedroom 's original red-oak-and-mahogany parquet . Later , eight long months into a $100,000 contract to renovate their 70-year-old Dallas house , the contractor simply disappeared . When the Campbells found him six frantic weeks later , they agreed not to sue for breach of contract . But a year later , they ended up in court anyway , over the foundation 's crumbling , incorrectly mixed concrete . Then they found out that the contractor was n't insured . <p> A classic renovation horror story , complete with cost overruns , nonexistent schedules , shoddy work and mental anguish . In 1991 , the Better Business Bureau heard more than 30,000 similar tales on repairs and renovations . How can you make sure that your home improvement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contractor because building is not their field of expertise , " points out David Creech , president of Creative Design Contractors Inc. , in Charles County , Md . " And there are unscrupulous contractors who take advantage of people 's ignorance . Unless homeowners take an active part in the project and research the contractor 's ability and reputation , they leave themselves wide open to being ripped off . " <p> Homeowners often fear sharp operators , but it can be just as risky to hook up with a poor businessperson . " A lot of folks do n't realize what it takes to make money in this business , " observes Ann Marie Moriarty , senior editor with the trade journal Remodeling . " Some contractors might be doing good work . But if their prices are too low , eventually they run out of money . It 's always the last one or two clients who get burned . " <p> During the 1980s , spending for remodeling products and services more than doubled , reaching $106 billion in 1990 . Between 1990 and 1991 , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Association of Home Builders ( NAHB ) , home improvement expenditures dipped 8% , largely because of a drop in high-ticket renovations and additions . <p> Has this created a buyer 's market in home remodeling ? Probably yes , if that buyer is careful . In slow markets , warns Moriarty , more contractors may underbid to keep afloat , and be forced to cut corners or walk away mid-project . " Bigger , better-run companies will probably cut their margins just a tad to be competitive , " she continues . " Therefore you can probably afford a better-quality remodeler . " Laying The Groundwork <p> Despite its sour turn , the Campbells ' project was carefully thought out . The contractor came highly recommended for his work on several of the historic neighborhood 's old houses . " He 's a wonderful craftsman , " Alva concedes generously , " but he 'd never overseen a massive overhaul like this . Managing the money and the people were just beyond him . " <p> Greg and Alva spent the spring of 1988 walking through the house with various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foundations , plumbing , wiring , " Alva says . " We 'd say , Anything is possible for unlimited money , but can we do this for what we have to spend ? ' " As the budget took shape , the Campbells decided to hold off on landscaping and some decorative frills . And , because reworking existing space is usually cheaper than building on , they moved several walls to make the floor plan more usable . <p> " Most people just do n't understand construction costs , " says East Coast contractor Creech . In early planning sessions , he and his clients discuss choices for the visible components  --  windows , door trims , light fixtures and appliances . But equally important are the unseen framing , plumbing , wiring and insulation . " Homeowners tend to overspend on their initial wish lists , " Creech says . " When the reality hits them , we have to start finding ways to cut back . " <p> When costs are a concern , advises Remodeling 's Moriarty , try to leave plumbing , heating or electrical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in appliances and cabinets , " she continues , " you can usually get a good value with a better-quality brand at the bottom of their line . " She also suggests tapping your contractor 's experience in choosing products . A builder might know that those jazzy faucets you crave are impossible to repair . Bear in mind , however , that remodelers lean toward what 's standard , tested and available . Do n't be talked out of what you really want . <p> " One thing we discovered was that renovation is an art , not a science , " Alva recalls . " If you go in expecting a single solution , you 're fooling yourself . So you collect information , and finally you , the novice , has to make a judgment call . " But , she jokes , " you learn a lot very fast . I was suddenly talking pier-and-beam foundations like an expert . " <p> The Campbells learned too late that their contractor needed closer supervision . Regular business meetings and detailed progress reports might have kept problems from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and budget for how work is managed day-to-day . " <p> Mid-project changes derailed schedules and drove up the Campbells ' costs . Unforeseen conditions forced several of these " change orders . " The savvy homeowner will budget in an extra 10% or so for such surprises . <p> Change orders are usually written up , signed and paid for before they 're done . Contractor Creech stresses that the change-order policy should be clarified upfront . " Halfway through the project , the owner can suddenly decide that he or she wants lights installed here and here , " he says . " Well , the electrician has already roughed in the wiring for the original positions , and someone has to pay to have him come back and redo it . " Another Home , Another Story <p> Even the right contractor ca n't always steer you clear of remodeling 's pitfalls . Drs . Patrice and Herbert Nickens of Washington , D.C. , praise the contractor who expanded their 1907 cinder-block and stucco home . " He was very conscientious and had some artistic sense , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some problems we might not have anticipated . " Their 2,200-square-foot addition extended the kitchen and added a family room , a master bedroom suite , a guest-bath entrance , atrium and attached garage . The contractor estimated three months ' work ; the Nickenses anticipated eight , but construction dragged on for 18 . Because the contractor worked alone , calling in help when he needed it , things moved slowly . <p> Regarding the budget , Herbert laughs ruefully , " I do n't think homeowners know what they 'll end up paying  --  if they did , they 'd probably never begin . " Earlyon , the couple heard construction estimates between$75 and $120 per square foot . " We thought that was crazy , " he recalls . " But we inched right up there . " <p> " The first big decision on our renovation was whether we should do it at all , " Herbert notes . They appreciated their house 's charm , but they could n't plunge into improvements without regard to market values . " Before taking on a project of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ready to do a fairly harsh analysis of the house and your location . " The Nickenses looked at houses  --  old , new , badly or well-renovated  --  and eventually decided to stay where they were . <p> Like the Campbells , the Nickenses worked with an architect on detailed working drawings and specifications . " If you do n't have a lot of details about exactly what you want , then you ca n't compare the prices you 're quoted , " Herbert says . <p> Most contractors also can provide designs , usually along fairly standardized lines . Some will fold the cost into the final bid , while " designbuild " firms will charge fora custom plan . " I do n't think consumers should cringe at paying for a professional design , " notes Remodeling editor Moriarty . " Too often what you get for nothing is worth just that . " <p> The Nickenses asked three contractors to make bids . " Getting a low bid might not be the best choice , " Herbert Nickens warns . " One builder might come in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Compare the proposals carefully ; what is n't there might cost you later . <p> In 1991 , NAHB pegged the average cost of a kitchen remodel at $17,592 ; a major bath renovation , $9,449 ; adding a bathroom , $11,592 ; adding a patio or deck , $4,437 ; and remodeling a family or living room , $19,902 . <p> Yet such numbers mean little in pricing any particular project . " I could n't believe all the decisions , " recalls Alva Campbell . " One toilet costs $50 , another one costs $500 . " With scores of such discretionary choices in a major project , the cost might easily double . <p> " We consciously chose some fairly expensive building materials , " says Herbert Nickens . " We could have cut costs there , but we chose not to . We made each decision with yes open  --  wincing , perhaps , but they were open . <p> The couple also winced when unexpected complications forced some change orders . " You also find that existing problems of your house suddenly become very obvious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as we 're at it , we may as well do that , too . ' Which may be true , but your budget goes up . " <p> Their contract specified a schedule of payments tied to completion points in the project . " Do n't put too much cash down upfront , " Herbert advises . " If your contractor disappears , you 're never in good shape , but if he 's got half the money , and he 's only put up two sticks , you 're in deep trouble . " A series of smaller payouts , at least six , might be more agreeable to both parties . <p> Work should never begin without a highly detailed contract , that spells out every task and product , as well as any finishing work or materials the homeowner is supplying . <p> All contracts should be approved by a lawyer . A release-of-liens form signifies that all subcontractors have been paid . " If your contractor fails or is unscrupulous , " warns Herbert , " the subcontractor could hold you liable for the payments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for thousands of dollars for electrical work or plumbing . " Choosing Your Contractor <p> Perhaps the most critical decision in a remodeling project is the general contractor . How do you find a true professional ? Get recommendations from friends , relatives and acquaintances . Then ask the contractor for a long list of former clients you can grill . There 's no guarantee , but membership in the National Association of the Remodeling Industry ( NARI ) and the NAHB Remodelors Council suggests an established business . Make sure the contractor is licensed and bonded if required by your state . Is he or she insured ? Do n't take anyone 's word  --  contact the insurance company . Otherwise , you could be liable for whatever happens on your property . Check with the Better Business Bureau for any unresolved complaints against the firm . Is the firm solvent ? Check with suppliers . Be even more careful in your selection if the work requires an open-ended " time and materials " or " cost-plus " estimate as opposed to a negotiated bid . Make sure the highly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are all standard . Last but not least , can you work with and trust this person ? If you do n't feel a rapport in the upbeat planning stage of the remodeling project , your partnership will surely turn rocky in tougher times . Going It Alone <p> Some homeowners take on the daunting task of being their own general contractor  --  or find the role thrust upon them . Dolores Robinson hired a professional remodeler to help tackle " the ugliest house I 'd ever seen , " a shabby Mediterranean cottage saved only by its prime location ( two blocks from Beverly Hills ) and a fire-sale price of $370,000 . " I had a very clear vision of where the house should go . But I was always having a battle trying to get what I wanted . " Two general contractors later , she took the helm herself . <p> According to NAHB , costs in an average remodeling break down as 35% materials , 36% labor and some 30% contractor 's overhead and profit . In theory , if you 're the general contractor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a novice to make that logic work . Estimating costs is tricky , even for a pro , so your budget could run out long before the work does . Banks are reluctant to finance major work not overseen by a contractor . Also , pros can usually bargain better for labor and materials . " You 're at the bottom of the subcontractor 's list because you 're a one-shot project , " Moriarty warns . <p> One thing you 'll probably need to do as the general contractor is buying insurance for the workers and the site . Few people have the time and patience needed to select and order materials , hire and supervise subcontractors , enforce quality , get permits and inspections and chase details . <p> " I can now see the value of a contractor in dealing with problem workers , " Robinson says . She finally got tough with the subcontractors . " In the contract , we 'd write in the completion date , " she explains , " and agree that , after a 10-day grace period , we 'd start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Robinson 's new interior and exterior walls , imported tile work throughout , a revamped kitchen and baths and extensive landscaping consumed more than $100,000 . It was worth it ; Robinson refused a $750,000 offer on the newly done house two years ago , and even in this cooler market she estimates it would fetch $650,000 . <p> Other homeowners are even more hands-on . In a family neighborhood of Atlanta , Iona Warren , a real estate agent , saw potential in a run-down but sturdy traditional brick two-story priced at $69,500 . She and her husband , Carlton , and their three children have already rebuilt the porch , wallpapered , repainted , ripped up carpeting and refinished floors . They subcontracted the heating and cooling systems and rough plumbing , but installed their own fixtures and wallboarded over the ductwork . <p> A potential do-it-yourselfer must steer clear of overconfidence , since amateurish improvement adds little value and might even detract from a house . But Iona and Carlton proceeded carefully . " You can really make the money stretch if you 're willing to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that materials and contracted work eventually will total between $15,000 and $18,000 . <p> An off-the-cuff appraisal recently tagged the home 's value at $100,000 . " But I do n't know if we 'll ever sell , " she says . " It 's a beautiful house . " <p> " And it has helped us pass on our values  --  I saw my parents do this kind of work , and now our kids have seen us . " A similar blend of daily comfort and long-term reward of financial and emotional satisfaction is perhaps what homeowners seek for their remodeling dollar . <p> PHOTO : Drs .

Using your home as collateral , you can borrow up to 80% of your home 's appraised value . This is repaid at a fixed interest rate over five to 30 years . Home equity credit line . The loan becomes a line of credit you can tap . The adjustable interest rate , a percentage point or two over prime , is charged only on the amount withdrawn  --  a nice fit with remodeling 's periodic , unpredictable cash needs . Be wary of low , short-lived " teaser " rates ; if the prime shoots up , so do your payments . <p> Interest on financing secured by your home is still tax-deductible within certain limits ; however , this is coming under fire . Always remember that equity loans still put your home at risk . Refinanced mortgage : If you take out a new , larger mortgage reflecting the house 's current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference is available for home improvements . Most experts recommend refinancing only if you can snag a new interest rate at least two percentage points below your present one . Home improvement loan : If you have n't built up much equity , you might turn to these straightforward loans , which may be secured by the house . Regular monthly payments , at a fixed interest rate , chip away at the loan over its five-to-seven-year term . The interest rate may be higher than equity-based financing , but upfront costs are minimal . Unsecured personal loan . If you lack equity or sufficient collateral , yet are creditworthy , you may still be able to obtain an unsecured personal loan . The interest rate will be high and the loan term short . <p> The Federal Housing Administration offers Title I loan insurance for secured home-improvement loans of up to $17,500 . The insurance protects the lender against default , so a Title I loan may be easier to get and offer a lower interest rate . For participating lenders in your area , call 800-733-HOME . <p> Mutually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borrow money from family or friends and save face . Say you know someone who has substantial savings or an investment that is only earning 5% interest . Now the banks are offering home improvement loans at 10% interest . You can opt to get the loan from your relative at 8% . This way he or she earns 2% more on the money and you save 2% per year . <p> You 'll find that interest rates and upfront fees vary widely even on the same type of loan . In general , on a long-term loan , hunt for the lowest rate possible , and on a shorter-term note , try to whittle down the initial costs . <p> RESOURCES <p> For brochures on selecting a contractor and referrals to local members , send a self-addressed stamped envelope to : National Association of Home Builders/Remodelors Council , 1201 15th St. NW , Washington , DC 20005 , 800-368-5242 ; and National Association of the Remodeling Industry , 4301 N.
