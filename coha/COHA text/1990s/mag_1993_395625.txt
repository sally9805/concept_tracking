In 1990 , my children and I were homeless . After divorcing , I relocated from Illinois to New York but was unable to find a landlord who would rent to me because I had four children , and we were forced to move into a homeless shelter . My naivete had me believe that living in a homeless shelter would be a temporary setback . But nearly a year later I felt trapped like a fly in a web of bureaucracy . Housing was available but , because of my income as a substitute early-childhood teacher , I did n't qualify . Forced to quit my job , I became a statistic on the welfare rolls in order to become eligible for assistance from government agencies . Today , through hard work , I 'm off  --  and intend to stay off  --  welfare . I 'm a private citizen again . My business is no longer an open book to the government . My children and I have a new self-respect , and our lives feel whole . But getting here has n't been easy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistance was a situation I never dreamed I 'd be in . Applying for welfare was the most humiliating experience I 've ever had in my life . On welfare , I felt as if my life was public information . The government not only knew my name , address ( or lack of one ) and Social Security number as well as those of my children , but also dictated how much money I could have in the bank and how much I could earn . Degraded but undaunted , I decided to make the system work for me . Eventually , I found an apartment . With the help of EARP ( Emergency Assistance Rehousing Program ) , a division of the Department of Homeless Services that pays private landlords a subsidy to house homeless families , I was finally out of the shelter . My rent was paid in part by welfare and Section 8 . Once I obtained employment as an administrative assistant , the Work-Related Benefits Program within the Human Resources Administration defrayed my child-care expenses for the maximum one year . However , welfare payments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very strict budget and the strong desire to remain independent help keep me free of the system . I soon realized there were other women in situations similar to mine . It 's a commonly held belief that , once on public assistance , women in generation after generation succumb to the trap of welfare . Now many of us across the country are dispelling the myth that women , and African-American women in particular , actually want to be on welfare . PROGRAMS THAT HELP According to the report Combining Work and Welfare : An Alternative Anti-Poverty Strategy from the Institute for Women 's Policy Research ( IWPR ) , " The picture of all welfare recipients as lazy , dependent and passive is inaccurate . " Based on an IWPR study of 585 single mothers on AFDC ( Aid to Families with Dependent Children ) , four out of ten recipients , in fact , worked at paid jobs either by simultaneously combining work and welfare benefits ( 17 percent ) or by cycling between work and welfare ( 22 percent ) . One of the best-kept secrets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( FSA ) , which was signed by President Ronald Reagan before he left office . The act is major legislation that requires all adults with children over age 3 ( age 1 in some states ) to participate in education , job search or job training . Its centerpiece is the Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Training Program ( JOBS ) , which funds state initiatives that seek to move people from public assistance to employment . These programs are mandated nationwide and had to be implemented by 1992 . Each state was responsible for designing and naming its own program . Even though these programs have been in the works since 1988 , many welfare recipients still know little or nothing about them because the information is not readily available . To take advantage of these programs , a person on welfare must take the initiative to inquire about them at her local welfare office . While most state programs are considered by some to be slavery for benefits , one impressive program that could serve as a model is Project Independence in Louisiana . According to Mary Joseph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs . But most important , women are getting educated through the program . They are receiving not just high-school  --  equivalency diplomas , but associate and bachelor degrees . " We 've had a lot of successes , " says Joseph . " We 've had women who have graduated from college . We feel we 're getting good results from a program in its infancy . " Another independent advocacy group that helps welfare recipients make the transition from welfare to economic independence is the Welfare Rights Organization ( WRO ) , located in New Orleans ( see box for more information ) . A six-week course operating under the WRO title " And Still I Rise , " named after the inspirational poem by Maya Angelou , offers counseling along with school and work-preparation skills . The program leaves graduates with high self-esteem and a history of the welfare system . Knowledge of their African-American culture and motivation to further their education are gained at WRO 's Communiversity program . The driving force behind the Welfare Rights Organization is its executive director , Viola Francois-Washington , a former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and beyond welfare . Francois-Washington knows women want to work and says , " I have never seen a woman who has opted for welfare as opposed to working . " She inspires women to " wake up the spirit and take charge of their lives . " The WRO 's And Still I Rise program also brings in motivational speakers such as Dr. Morris F.X . Jeff , Jr. , director of the City Welfare Department in New Orleans and a former president of the National Association of Black Social Workers located in Detroit . Jeff , along with Francois-Washington , was appointed to the Louisiana Governor 's Task Force on Welfare Reform . Jeff says he feels " the system is not geared to take people off welfare . This program will cost the state money , but eventually it will save money by turning welfare recipients into taxpayers . " A PLACE TO CALL HOME Because I 've lived on welfare , I know what it 's like to be treated like dirt by a caseworker who makes little more than my welfare check . I know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor does n't accept Medicaid . I know what it 's like to be sneered at with contempt in the grocery-store line if I have on nice clothes and pay for my groceries with food stamps . No one can tell me that women want to be treated in this manner for a minuscule amount of money . For these reasons and many more , women are fighting in their own way to get off welfare by any means necessary . And they are succeeding . Even though I have been off welfare for more than two years , one problem I have been haunted by is that my income must remain within Section 8 guidelines or my rent stipend will be stopped . This hinders me from growing in my field , taking a higher-paying job and saving large sums of money . Unless I can get a substantial salary increase , my apartment will not be affordable without Section 8 . But I wo n't allow the system to get the best of me . When I signed the 32-month lease to the apartment I have now , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expired . By maintaining a strict budget and saving a portion of my salary , by the time this story appears , I will own a five-bedroom house that my children and I can call home .
