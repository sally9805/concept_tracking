Nothing in their numerous joint TV projects on parenting had quite prepared Good Morning America cohost Joan Lunden and her husband , producer Michael Krauss , for the sad task before them . Gathering their three daughters , Jamie , 11 , Lindsay , 8 , and Sarah , 4 , in the master bedroom of their brown-shingle suburban New York house , they delicately broke the news that their 13-year marriage was coming to an end . " Mommy and Daddy do n't hate each other , " Lunden began softly , following the advice of the girls ' pediatrician , Dr. Jeffrey Brown , whom they had consulted the day before . " We 're still very good friends , and we 're still going to be Mommy and Daddy to you . But Mommy has another house now , and you 're going to live part of the time with Mommy and part of the time with Daddy . " Six weeks later , Lunden still is n't sure how much sank in . " It 's hard to tell with little kids , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised , because there has n't been a lot of togetherness in our house for a long time . I 'm not sure how much the 8-year-old understands . I think the 4-year-old understands a lot more than we thought because she asked a lot of questions . She wanted to know , " Is it like getting fired from marriage ? ' " " No , " Lunden reassured Sarah . " It 's just that we are not going to live together anymore . Sometimes that happens . " Five days after informing the kids , Lunden installed herself in a brand-new six-bedroom , 8,000-square-foot leased house in suburban Connecticut , only 15 minutes away from her former residence . Shortly after she moved in , she took off her wedding ring , substituting a three-band gold ring that her children had given her for Mother 's Day four years ago . In her new home , she did n't have to oil the hinges of the bedroom door , which she had respectfully done since her marriage so that she would n't wake Krauss up when she left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work at GMA . " I have n't been alone in a house for 13 years , " says Lunden . " Last night the girls went to Michael 's . I came in the house , and the cat was there . That was it . I was rambling around in this big house all by myself . " And now , though relieved , she admits to no little trepidation . " To be out there on your own is really scary , " she says . " You also wonder if you 're going to be alone for the rest of your life . " The news of the split between Lunden , 41 , and Krauss , 52 , was as puzzling to Lunden 's fans as it was to little Sarah . Viewers , entranced by Lunden 's friendly manner and well-scrubbed good looks , had cheered her through three pregnancies during her 16 years on GMA and followed her progress as a mother on the syndicated and cable shows that Krauss created for his wife : Mother 's Minutes , Mother 's Day and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  perfect career , perfect family , perfect life . Her corner on the wholesomeness market not only brought her a multimillion-dollar contract with ABC but attracted dozens of offers to pitch such products as Beech-Nut baby foods and Vaseline Intensive Care lotion . In reality , though , there was a chink in the armor of the Great American Wife and Mother . " I hate the supermom thing , " Lunden says . " It 's as though somehow I 'm held two rungs above everybody else . Because I 've had my babies in front of people , it 's kind of like I could n't let my marriage fail . But nobody can handle the whole thing perfectly . " Lunden has not often revealed such a melancholy appreciation of reality . " Joan always seemed like the perfect wife , " says Janice Kaplan , a producer on the syndicated Everyday , the one-season flop that , insiders say , strained her marriage by forcing too much togetherness . " She did everything for Michael . His office was filled with presents from Joan . Fabulously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he plays the drums . This big popcorn machine from Hammacher Schlemmer . She surprised him with a red Porsche in the driveway for his 50th birthday . " But Lunden 's most important gift to Krauss , her associates agree , was Something to Do . When they started dating , he was a seasoned Good Morning America producer and she was learning the ropes as an occasional reporter on the show . " I think Joan turned to Michael at the beginning for security and confidence , " says Kaplan . " And certainly he helped her with that . " But her career quickly surpassed his . Kaplan adds , " Michael has said many times that the Mother 's Day kinds of things that Joan did made her reputation and career . But I think most people see it quite the opposite . Joan was extremely successful and was willing to do all these projects because it was what Michael wanted . " Lunden admits that the breakup did n't happen overnight . " There are no horror stories , " she says . " Michael and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 've been growing apart for years . I probably stayed in it much longer than I should have . " Last year Lunden confided in her friend and GMA cohost , Charles Gibson . " We had breakfast one day , " he says . " She began to tell me what distress they were in . And I asked her , " Do you want to save this ? " And she said , " Yes . " And I said , " I think the thing to do is for you and Michael to get into marriage counseling right away . ' " They did . " We went three times a week  --  Mondays , Tuesdays and Thursdays , " Lunden says . " In the first few months I was really optimistic . Counseling taught Michael and me the things that were bothering each other . But it did n't mean that we could resolve these things . " Lunden and Krauss never fought , Joan says . " We just did n't talk . That was part of the problem . " In fact Lunden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before she broke the news to Michael . " Our nanny has been with us for seven years , and I got her to guarantee me that she would n't leave before I made my decision , " says Lunden . " She said , " I want to be there to help the children through it . ' " Immediately afterward , she told Michael her decision . " I did n't really discuss this with many people , which was n't necessarily healthy , " Lunden concedes . " My mother did n't even know about it until after I told Michael . I did n't want to burden her . I told her a day or two before it hit the papers . " On Jan. 27 , when she was safely on vacation and unreachable by the press , Lunden announced publicly through her lawyer , Stanford Lotwin , that she and Krauss were separating and that they would share custody of the children . That week , she literally began redesigning her life . After signing the lease on her new house , Lunden stopped at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of the interior-design department . " I said , " I have a new house . It 's very large and it 's very empty . I want it to be completely full in 10 days . Can you do that ? If the answer is no , tell me now , and I 'll move on . ' This was not the old me talking . This was a new person . " Bloomies obliged , and Lunden pointed out what she wanted : funky and eclectic bedroom furniture , dining tables , sofas , chairs  --  totally unlike the serious , traditional pieces that she was giving up . Next stop was a home-electronics store . " I said , " I want seven TVs  --  two large-screen and five small , with VCRs in them , ' " she remembers . " " There 's just one small catch . Cable TV is coming tomorrow at 2 , so the sets have to be in my house tomorrow morning . ' The guy said OK . I had never done anything like this before . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pillows , a toaster and dishes . Her mission was to offer a warm new home to her children without dismantling the decor in their father 's house . " I could n't move out and take everything with me , " says Lunden , who brought along nothing but her treadmill ( " And I felt completely guilty for doing it " ) to her new digs . " My children still go back to the house and live there with their father . I want their old rooms to be exactly like they were before . I went out and bought the kids almost all new clothes , because I do n't want them to say , " Oh , I ca n't get dressed here because my black shoes are at Daddy 's . ' Thank God I am one of the most organized individuals on Earth , which was a pet peeve of my husband 's . During that week , all these deliveries came . I can relax now . It 's done . " Still , Lunden is n't going lonely cold turkey . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls for dinner a couple of times a month so that our kids still have us as a family , " she says . " But I 'm getting on with my life . I 'm not a person who looks back . " If she wanted to , Lunden could look back with pride . Born to surgeon Erle Murray Blunden and his wife , Gladyce , in Sacramento , Joan and her brother , Jeff , now 42 and a fishing guide who lives in Sacramento , got an early taste of independence . Their father , a seasoned pilot , died in 1964 when the plane he was flying back from a business trip crashed , and their mother went to work selling real estate . " I 've always felt that need to be responsible for myself , " says Lunden , who got her associate 's degree from American River Junior College in Sacramento and began her TV career at 23 as a weather girl on KCRA in Sacramento . When she was hired away by New York City 's WABC-TV in 1975 , she changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managers who felt that Blunden might be mispronounced " Blunder . " Though there were early suggestions that her success was due more to her looks than her talent , Lunden 's star continued to rise , and she soon combined reporting duties on the local station with new-product stories on GMA , where she fell in love with Krauss . " Michael was a creative , gregarious , charming guy , not like anybody I had ever known before , " says Lunden , who married him on Sept. 10 , 1978 . Her position on GMA expanded in 1980 when she took over the No. 2 spot opposite the imperious David Hartman . ( Lunden still bumps into Hartman occasionally at the private school their children attend . When they meet , she says , he is " pleasant . " ) Yet even during her early years on the GMA set , when Lunden was regarded by critics as little more than a decoration ( she was even called " David 's lamp " by one ) , Lunden charted new territory for working mothers , staking out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at work . " In my day you did n't mention your children , and you certainly did n't bring your children into the studio , " says Lunden 's friend and colleague Barbara Walters . " People did n't even know when you were pregnant . I think one of the reasons why Joan is so popular is that viewers have lived along with her . She 's real . " When Charlie Gibson replaced Hartman on GMA in February 1987 , Lunden enjoyed full-fledged cohost status for the first time , and her career soared . But her private life had begun to sour . The most visible symbol of that secret stress was Lunden 's dress size . " When I was turning 39 , " she says , " I basically said to myself , " You 've had three kids , and each time you 've never lost the weight completely . ' Each pregnancy had left an extra 15 lbs. , so I was about 45 lbs . overweight . I said , " You 're not happy with yourself . You 're not happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can either turn 40 and hit the ground running and feel great , or you can be really miserable and depressed . ' I hired nutritionists and totally changed the way I ate . I got myself a fitness trainer for two hours a day , three days a week , to do stretching , aerobics and weights for my upper body . I took up horseback riding and bought three thoroughbreds  --  Casey , Charlie ( named after Gibson ) and Sammy . Before marriage counseling , horseback riding was my therapy . " Lunden took off the 45 lbs . " My life totally changed , " she says . " Subconsciously , I might have also been readying myself for whatever was to come . My husband , I think , really could n't quite understand the whole thing . I think he wondered , " Who is this new person ? " " After her separation from Krauss was announced , hundreds of letters and phone calls began pouring into GMA . " Fans are unbelievably supportive , " Lunden says . So concerned was Lunden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussed the subject at a meeting with image consultants and ABC brass . " It was the advice of the bosses not to say anything , " she says . " On my first show back after vacation , Charlie simply said at one point , " How are you doing ? You OK ? We 've all been thinking about you . ' And I said , " I 'm doing fine and my girls are fine . Thank you for asking . ' And that was it . " Not really . Lunden was furious three weeks later when supermarket tabloids linked her with Growing Pains star Alan Thicke . " Now they 're saying that I was cheating on my husband , " says Lunden . " They could have at least picked somebody that I knew well . I met Alan Thicke when Michael hired him for an ABC special . Then Disney hired him to host the Christmas and Easter parades with me . I do n't know this guy personally from a load of wood . " What really bothers me , " she continues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be hurt . But my kids have a sense of humor about it . Jamie said , " Well , at least they could pick someone really hot , Mom . ' " Tabloid stories aside , the prospect of starting a new relationship frightens Lunden . " First of all , I 'm older , " she says . " Second of all , I have three kids . That narrows my universe right away . And the thought of getting involved in the dating game is really not something I 'm looking forward to . " For now , at least , Joan appears content to go it alone . " I 've talked to experts , or to stars , about their breaking up , starting a new life , being a single parent , " she says . " But when you 're all of a sudden presented with it yourself , you just go through it , hoping that you 're going to make the right decisions . I know it 's going to be a tough six months to a year , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a career ahead of me . Life 's going to be different , but it does n't have to be awful . Right now I 'm doing great . I 'm looking ahead . " <p>
