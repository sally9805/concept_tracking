<p> The Food and Drug Administration can regulate tobacco products but can not impose its far-reaching advertising and promotion restrictions on the tobacco industry , a federal district judge ruled yesterday . <p> The mixed ruling , by U.S. District Judge William L. Osteen Sr. in Greensboro , N.C. , was a blow to the tobacco industry , which had vehemently fought the FDA 's plans to assert broad jurisdiction over its products for the first time . <p> President Clinton called the decision " on balance , a great victory " and said that the Justice Department would appeal to reinstate the advertising and promotional restrictions . In an interview , Vice President Gore said the decision " validates President Clinton 's efforts to protect children from this deadly and highly addictive product . " <p> The decision was hailed by anti-smoking advocates . Matthew L. Myers of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids called the ruling " the most devastating loss the tobacco industry has suffered in any court in the United States . " <p> " It is stunning . It is amazing , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the initiative to have the nicotine in tobacco regulated as a drug and the products themselves as " drug delivery devices . " He called the decision a " landmark . " <p> The tobacco industry saw the decision differently and focused on the importance of the judge 's denial of advertising authority . " We are very pleased the court ruled that the advertising and promotion regulations are invalid and struck them down , " said Charles A. Blixt , general counsel for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co . In a joint statement , tobacco industry firms pledged to continue to fight any FDA jurisdiction over its products . <p> The decision could increase pressure on the tobacco industry to negotiate a comprehensive settlement of the many legal attacks it faces from state officials , product liability attorneys and federal regulators . <p> The news caused tobacco stocks to dive . The shares of Philip Morris Cos. , the world 's biggest tobacco company and the manufacturer of Marlboro , fell $ 2.37 , or 5.7 percent yesterday , closing at $ 39.25 . RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. , which markets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $ 28.75 . <p> Osteen 's decision leaves in effect the first stage of the FDA 's tobacco regulation plan , which includes a national ban on tobacco sales to anyone younger than 18 , mandatory photo identification checks of everyone under age 27 buying cigarettes , restrictions on vending machines and bans on self-service displays and promotional cigarette giveaways . <p> But the decision blocks the agency 's plans to institute restrictions on advertising and promotional activities , the most controversial aspect of the FDA action . The agency had planned to prohibit all tobacco billboards within 1,000 feet of schools and playgrounds and to restrict ads in magazines with a substantial underage readership to a black-and-white text format . Promotional items such as logo-bearing caps and tote bags also would have been forbidden . Regulations that would have gone into effect next year would have prohibited name-brand sponsorship of sporting events like car races and rodeos . <p> Gary Black , a tobacco industry analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein and Co. , said that without the advertising restrictions the FDA plan would not be effective . " The FDA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . <p> The ruling means that tobacco companies can continue their sponsorship of sporting events , including auto racing . R.J. Reynolds , through its Winston brand , is the primary sponsor of NASCAR , the stock car circuit that has realized explosive growth this decade . Reynolds 's rival Philip Morris has a significant involvement with the IndyCar series . On the IndyCar and NASCAR series , several cars are sponsored by tobacco-related companies . <p> " Advertising won a major victory today , " said Dan Jaffe , executive vice president of the Association of National Advertisers , which had sued the agency . " The FDA just does n't have regulatory authority over tobacco advertising , period . " Jaffe called the decision a " very important step for the protection of First Amendment rights for advertisers in this country . " <p> The judge did not rule directly on the First Amendment issues . Instead , he said that the agency did not have the authority under the provision of the Food , Drug and Cosmetics Act that it used to justify the ad ban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " allows the agency to regulate a product 's sale or " other conditions . " Osteen wrote that " ' other conditions ' can not be so broadly construed as to encompass conditions on advertising and promotion . " <p> An expert in food and drug law found the judge 's 65-page opinion " inconsistent . " Lewis A. Grossman of American University Law School said that the opinion gives the agency great latitude to regulate cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products as medical devices , but suddenly becomes more strict in its scrutiny of the single clause that the agency said allowed it to regulate advertising . " That 's not some kind of bizarre or nonsensical interpretation of that clause , " Grossman said . " It 's interesting to me that he hung it on that . " <p> The agency 's decision to call the products medical devices but to give regulatory authority to its drug division is at least as questionable , Grossman said . But , he said , following that logical path to find otherwise could have raised huge problems for both the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agency could not regulate tobacco products as devices , then they would have to be regulated as drugs  --  with the strict requirement that the manufacturer prove the products ' safety . " It would have been doomsday for the FDA 's entire ' partway approach ' to regulating the product , " Grossman said . <p> Gore pledged that the administration would get the " narrow point " Osteen used to block the advertising restrictions overturned on appeal . Even if those rules can not be restored , however , the finding of jurisdiction leaves the FDA with a number of other regulatory options . It would still have the power to require that tobacco products be sold by prescription , or could even ban the products if the industry can not prove that they are safe . " Once it 's a drug , once it 's a device , there are an array of tools that can be used , " Kessler said . <p> Pressure on advertising could also come from the Federal Trade Commission , which recently reopened an investigation into whether R.J. Reynolds 's " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spokesman Jaffe said that his group does not oppose FTC regulation , since " The FTC , we believe , has expertise . That 's what they do , is regulate advertising . " <p> Anti-tobacco activists had expressed fears that the court chosen by the industry to hear the case could be biased toward cigarette makers , because North Carolina is a tobacco state and the judge had lobbied Washington for tobacco growers in the 1970s . The extent of the FDA 's win thus sends a strong message to the industry , said Myers of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids . <p> " This particular judge was literally selected by the tobacco industry out of all of the judges in the United States . If the tobacco industry ca n't convince this judge that it should n't be regulated as a drug , it has virtually no chance on appeal , " Myers said . <p> The decision " sets the tobacco industry on a path to be regulated . . . . The authority of the FDA to oversee this industry is far more significant than any single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Myers said . " Jurisdiction is what this was all about . " <p> Kessler was exuberant about the judgment . " It 's a victory for the nation , for the public health , " Kessler said . <p> " A small group of very committed people at the agency took on the impossible , " Kessler said . " The president of the United States supported them , and a federal district judge in North Carolina in very large measure agreed . . . . <p> " It will change forever the way tobacco products are viewed , " Kessler said . <p> Staff writer Saundra Torry and special correspondent Josh Barr contributed to this report <p> CORRECTION-DATE : April 29 , 1997 <p> CORRECTION : A report Saturday on a federal court decision upholding the Food and Drug Administration 's authority to regulate tobacco products mischaracterized the views of American University law professor Lewis A.
