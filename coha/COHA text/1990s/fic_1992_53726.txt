EVEN WHEN I WAS A KID I wondered how those little towns in Alabama and Mississippi got their names , how someone who lived in a house without windowpanes could muster up the nerve to name a town Athens or Florence or Paris , and that , too , when what they were naming was no more than an empty space or a single store and a few houses with the hogs wallowing in the street . So when Defoe Michaels said there was a party at Como , a picture of a villa perched on a mountain above a blue lake came into my mind . That spring I 'd studied the Italian Renaissance in my art history course at Ole Miss . <p> " We could go in your car , " Defoe said . <p> He was leaning against the doorway of the Texaco station watching his father pump gas into my car which I had bought after a summer spent planting pine trees . I 'd been stung by hornets , struck at by more than one rattlesnake , and had my skin frescoed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in almost perfect condition , its chrome bumpers spotless , the silver rocket hood ornament reflected in the wax job I 'd spent the morning giving it . Because my father had said he was not going to pay for a degree in art history after I dropped out of pharmacy school , I was going in the Marines in October . Once I finished my tour in Vietnam my plan was to take my combat pay and go to Italy . After that I 'd return to college on the G.I. Bill and study art history . At the time I had not thought at all about dying . <p> I never saw Defoe work in that filling station a single time . He was a gambler , not more than ten years older than me . Defoe was a beautiful man , the proportions of his body perfect , as if he had been chiseled out of dark-veined marble by Michelangelo . His face stood out among those lean , patchy red-and-white hill faces of the townspeople , and some said there was some Indian thrown in and others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think about when I was around him because he was the kind of man who could tell what you were thinking . Maybe that was what made him such a good poker player . When he looked hard at you , the muscles in his face twitched like they were receiving signals . <p> " Your daddy let you go ? " Defoe asked . <p> Defoe never drove . I might see him come home on a visit driving around the courthouse square with some woman at the wheel of a big car . The women were all pretty , and I never saw him with the same one twice . No one knew why he did n't drive . <p> " I go where I please , " I said , trying to act casual . <p> He laughed and stepped off the raised curb , crossing the ten or twelve feet to where I was standing . He was wearing a beautiful summer-weight wool suit , which anyone could see had been made by some New York tailor , and a pair of pointed shoes that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clung to his body like no department store suit ever would , so you could see and almost feel the smooth flex of muscles and bone and skin . Old Mr. Michaels went around to check the oil . <p> Defoe looked the car over . <p> " Nice , " he said . " But runs a little rough . " <p> " Carburetor needs rebuilding , " I said . <p> " You come get me at six , " he said . <p> I wondered where the woman was who had brought him . I 'd seen her standing with him in front of the drugstore , a pretty woman like all the others . <p> I paid old Mr. Michaels for the gas . <p> " You been back to the Tallahatchie ? " Defoe asked . <p> And I could see him , standing naked on the rust-stained bridge girder while I waited my turn beside him , my eyes on the long scar which ran from his right nipple to his shoulder blade . He 'd come home with that the first time he left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappearing into the brown water . <p> I 'd been twelve at the time and too scared to follow . <p> " Plenty of times , " I said . " It 's easy . " <p> He grinned and said nothing . Mr. Michaels handed me my change . When I got in the car and started it , Defoe bent down and leaned his arm on the paint-chipped windowsill , careless of the rich fabric of his jacket . <p> " Do n't you be late , " he said . <p> We drove toward Como , the setting sun fat and swollen over the hills . Defoe was dressed in a white linen suit with a blue tie . When he pulled a silver pocket flask out of his pocket and took a drink , I thought of what my father would say if he knew I was on the road with Defoe Michaels . But that was one reason I had joined the Marines , to keep from becoming like my father . When I told him I 'd joined up. , he yelled and called me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't going to lead a comfortable safe life . I was n't going to work in a pharmacy every day . <p> Defoe handed me the flask , and I took a drink . I 'd already sweated through my yellow button-down shirt and had loosened my striped tie , once knotted in a neat Windsor . These were the kind of clothes I 'd learned to wear that first year at Ole Miss . It was one of those real hot days and was n't going to get much cooler when it turned dark . Defoe looked like he was sitting on a cake of ice , that suit perfectly white and unrumpled , his hair slicked down so the wind did n't toss it around like it was blowing mine . His pink silk shirt had a big " D.M. " in baroque white stitching over one pocket . <p> " You up at the university ? " Defoe asked . <p> " Not anymore , " I said . <p> Then I told him about the Marines . <p> Defoe grinned and took another sip from the flask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road , looking like when we topped the next hill we were going to drive right into it . <p> " Going to Vietnam ? " he asked . <p> " I guess , " I said . <p> I took another drink , the whiskey burning as it went down in a way I was trying to learn to like . <p> " I lost the station , " Defoe said . <p> I looked over at him but did n't say anything . <p> " It was in Memphis , " he said . " Just got outplayed . That 's all . " <p> I thought of old Mr. Michaels pumping gas and never saying much . But he 'd lent me tools and given me parts on credit to get the first car I bought running . His wife had Defoe when she was almost forty . Now they both were old . I imagined Defoe telling them as they sat around the dinner table and how they had stopped eating in amazement , their jaws moving slowly on the okra or ham , as Defoe explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had destroyed their lives . <p> " You bet the station ? " I asked . <p> He looked at me , the muscles in his face twitching . <p> " I bet money I did n't have , " he said . <p> I concentrated on the road . <p> " We 'll find us a couple of women in Como , " he said . " Have us a good time . " <p> " That 's right , " I said . <p> I was wondering whether the Michaels would go live with relatives . The station was probably the old couple 's retirement , and Defoe had gambled it away . He did n't even seem sorry and that made me mad . It was no more to him than if he had pawned his watch to pay a debt . <p> I looked at him out of the corner of my eye while pretending to be studying a kudzu-filled ravine . <p> " Do n't you judge me , " Defoe said . <p> " It 's none of my business , " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the highway and drove a twisting road that finally dropped down to the lake . It was n't a real lake . The Corps of Engineers had dammed up the Tallahatchie River , and now the town of Como had a lake not five miles from the city limits . Below us were the lights around the spillway , the road running right across the top of the huge , earth-filled dam . <p> " I felt bad after I lost the station , " he said . " Nothing has ever made me feel that bad . " <p> Neither one of us said anything for a long time . I was eager to reach Como and get out of the car . Then Defoe spoke again . <p> " I lost it and went up to my room and got me a blow job . She would n't let me have her car . I could have won it all back with the car . " <p> I thought of the woman in front of the drugstore . She had long dark hair and wore a blue summery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over him , Defoe 's body stiff with the tension of the loss and then him coming , momentarily free from all of it . While she still had the taste of him in her mouth , he had asked her for the car keys so he could go back to the table . Now I knew why he did n't own a car . <p> " You could have done it , " I said . <p> And there was a part of me that believed he could . He looked that confident , sitting there next to me in his white suit , his hand around the silver flask , the other arm propped on the car window . <p> " Well , it do n't matter now , " he said . " We 'll drink some whiskey . Chase some women . " <p> He laughed and I joined him as we drove across the dam , the lights of Como sparkling in the distance . <p> The dance , held at the National Guard Armory , was part of the town 's annual Lake Como Festival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a beauty contest . I had been there the year before and had a good time . <p> Inside the barnlike building , Defoe and I went our separate ways across the concrete floor . Every now and then we 'd meet and share the flask . I noticed he was n't dancing but standing here and there in the crowd watching the dancers . It was hot in the building , the flashing lights from the bandstand making his white suit look purple . <p> Then I finally got a chance to dance with the Lady of the Lake , the winner of the beauty contest . She was dressed in white and wore a pasteboard crown decorated with glitter . Her long blond hair , so straight I could imagine her mother ironing it before the dance , swung loose down her back . The strapless evening dress she wore was staying up fine all by itself . She was barefoot , and since it was a slow dance , I was worried about stepping on her feet . <p> " I 've seen you at school , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of me . She felt light in my arms as we moved across the floor , cigarette smoke hanging in blue clouds above our heads , her face with those high cheekbones looking up at me . I did n't ever want to stop dancing with her . Just as I was telling her about my going in the Marines , someone cut in . I looked up and saw Defoe with a grin on his face . <p> " Go find you somebody else , " he said . <p> I stood by the wall and watched them dance . They looked good together , both dressed in white . Defoe was smooth , very smooth , and I did n't care for the way he pulled her close to him like they were already lovers . When the music was fast , Defoe stood almost completely still , just moving his hands while she danced around him . Nobody cut in . <p> Then I found another girl to dance with and kept looking for Penelope but did n't see her again . When the band took a break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car , expecting to see him filling up the flask from the bottle under the seat . He was there all right , and Penelope was with him . Defoe was kissing her , their mouths glued together , he standing up tall and straight and she kind of clinging to him . <p> They heard my feet on the gravel . She stooped down and picked up her crown . He took it from her . <p> " Her daddy 's got a cabin out on the lake , " Defoe said . " Let 's go out there . She 'll fix us something to eat . " <p> We all got in the car , she between us in the front seat . He still held her crown . We passed the flask around . <p> " Are n't you supposed to stay at the dance ? " I asked . " You 're the Lady of the Lake . " <p> She laughed . <p> " Not anymore , " she said . " Defoe 's got my crown . This is my first and last contest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pageant dresses . I 'm not going to be Miss Mississippi . " <p> Defoe tossed the crown out the window . <p> " Honey , you already are Miss Mississippi , " he said . <p> I wished I 'd said it first and thought of Defoe kissing her by the car . That should have been me . He would drift off and maybe never come back to Como . After the Marines I was coming home . She would still be here , teaching school in one of the nearby towns . <p> " Drive out to the lake , " she said . " We 'll dance all night in the cabin . I 'll fix y'all breakfast . " <p> I was drunk , but the whiskey did n't seem to have affected Defoe at all . She was just as drunk as me . <p> She had told me to watch for a turn onto a gravel road just before the road that led to the dam . I 'd found the turn and was starting to make it when she put her hand on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first , " she said . " You drive on up to the dam . " <p> " We 'll swim at the cabin , " Defoe said . <p> " No , in the spillway , " she said . <p> I knew she did n't mean the real spillway but the emergency spillway , built to deal with a deluge that would overwhelm the spillway and threaten the dam . The spillway was simply a concrete pathway over the western end of the dam which dropped into a channel that led to the river . The channel had filled with rainwater and was a deep clear pool perhaps five hundred yards long . <p> " I left my swimming trunks at home , " Defoe said . <p> " We wo n't need ' era , " she said . <p> At the spillway we stood off behind the car while she undressed . Defoe smoked a cigarette as we listened to the rustle of that gown coming off and then the sound of her wading into the water . He did n't seem to be interested , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to our underwear she swam around treading water and yelling at us to hurry up . He folded the white suit neatly and placed the silk shirt and blue tie on top of it . <p> " You watch her , " I said . " She could drown . " <p> " Come on , " she shouted . <p> Then we waded into the water which in the shallows was as warm as the air but turned cool as it got deeper . I had left the car running , and we swam around in the beams from the headlights . <p> " Let 's swim to the dam , " she said . <p> " It 's too far for you , honey , " Defoe said . <p> " Someone could get a cramp , " I said . <p> " I might as well have stayed at the dance and become Miss Mississippi , " she said . <p> She started swimming , a smooth crawl , and we followed . As soon as we swam out of the lights and the darkness dosed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls of the channel , made where the engineers had cut through a hill . I began to feel as if we were swimming in the bottom of a well or a cistern , doomed to swim round and round with no way out . She was much faster than either of us . When I turned over on my back to rest and looked up at the stars , I heard her steady kick in the distance . Defoe floated by me . <p> " She 's a banker 's daughter , " he said . <p> Then , out there in the darkness , wondering whether I was going to make it to the safety of the spillway , I saw it all . <p> " It wo n't work , " I said . " She 'll never do it . " <p> " But she 'd marry you , college boy , " he said . <p> He was treading water now , and I did the same . <p> " I 'm a Marine , " I said . <p> " You 'll always be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college and take over your daddy 's drugstore . I 'll be out there with nothing . " <p> It crossed my mind that Defoe might try to hurt me . But I was a little taller and heavier than he and those days of diving contests off the bridge were long gone . <p> " Nobody forced you to gamble , " I said . <p> " Everybody gambles , " he said . " Her daddy the banker gambles . He just calls it something else . " <p> Penelope was calling to us to catch up . <p> " You swim on back to the car , " he said . <p> Just then I heard the engine begin to run rough . It gave a couple of coughs and died . <p> " You go , " he said . " Battery ' 11 run down . " <p> He was beginning to gasp for breath . Playing cards is not a good way for a man to stay in shape . <p> I turned away from him and swam for the spillway , swimming a slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I reached it , Penelope was sitting on the lip at the bottom dressed only in a merry-widow bra and panties . <p> " Where is he ? " she asked . <p> There was a faint splashing sound from the channel . I guessed he was floating on his back and resting and told her not to worry . I hoped he 'd turn back to the car and leave us alone to talk . I 'd tell her about Defoe , how she could n't depend on him . I 'd tell her about all those women . But instead we heard the steady sound of his swimming coming closer and closer until finally he pulled himself up out of the water and lay on the lip breathing hard . When she helped him to his feet , he put his arms around her . I turned my head away and looked at the headlights which I already imagined were growing dimmer . <p> " What were y'all talking about out there ? " she asked . <p> " Gambling , " he said . <p> I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it . She was even more perfect than Defoe . And then the Miss America title in Atlantic City . Soon the accent would be gone . She 'd be in Italy long before me . <p> " I 'm going on the road with Defoe , " she said . <p> I wanted to scream , No , you ca n't . Only through a great effort did I keep my mouth shut . Defoe was looking at me ; he knew what I was thinking . I could imagine what she thought the road was going to be like  --  she standing with her hand on his shoulder while he sat at a poker table . But really what was going to happen was that he would take everything from her , and not just money . I noticed the headlights were now definitely fading . The battery was not a good one . <p> " You better go swim back to the car , " Defoe said . <p> " You go , " I said . <p> " We 'll draw for it , " Defoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sticks . Long stick wins . " <p> I heard a snap as she broke a stick in half . Then a couple more as she trimmed them to size . <p> " You draw first , " he said . <p> I could barely see the sticks in her closed fist , a thin one and a fat one . I chose the thin one , the stick slick and waterlogged , bits of it crumbling against my fingers as I pulled it out of her hand . She handed the other to Defoe . We compared sticks , holding them up against the lighter darkness of the sky . <p> " They 're the same , " I said . <p> She started to laugh and then we were all laughing , laughing so hard that we all sat down on the lip , the sound of our voices echoing off the walls of the channel . <p> " Both of you go , " she said , " case somebody gets a cramp . " <p> Defoe had a hard time with the swim , having to stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us did any talking . When we got close to shore , I picked up my stroke and swam on ahead . As I started the engine , I watched him stagger out of the water , his underwear hanging loose about his thighs . It was clear that he was not going to be able to make the swim again . <p> " We 'll let the battery charge a few minutes , " I said . " Then we 'll swim back . " <p> Defoe was still breathing hard . He got out the flask and took another drink . Then he offered it to me . I refused . My head was clear from the swim , and I wanted to keep it that way . <p> " You think I 'm doing wrong ? " Defoe said . <p> " It 's not for me to say , " I said . <p> " My daddy 's gon na lose everything . It 's my fault . I 've got to do something . You know he 's gon na take a job at the chicken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get to wear a suit and tie doing what I do . It makes me no different from those lawyers at the courthouse . I dress better than them . " <p> I took the flask out of his hand and drank . <p> " She 'll marry me , " he said . " I 'll treat her good . She do n't want to be a beauty queen . She do n't want to go back to the university and make a schoolteacher . " <p> " Her daddy wo n't give you a dime . " <p> " He might . " <p> So no matter what , he could n't stop being the gambler . <p> " You take the car , " I said . <p> He took another drink from the flask and gave me a long look as if he were trying to figure out what the catch was . <p> " I 'm leaving in two months , " I said . " You can sell it . Stake yourself to a game . You can pay me back with your winnings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right here and wait for her to swim back , " he said . <p> " Wo n't be much attraction for her in that , " I said . <p> He knew I was right . Defoe dressed slowly and carefully . I gathered Penelope 's gown and my clothes and put them in a pile on the grass . <p> " You doing this for her ? " he asked . " <p> No , for you , " I said . " For your daddy . " <p> Then I realized that was not true at all . <p> " I better see that money when I come home , " I said . <p> I tried to sound tough , but I knew it was still the voice of a boy . Defoe was not going to be impressed . <p> " I pay my debts , " he said . <p> I was thankful that he did n't laugh at me . <p> " But you got to remember . I 'm not as good a gambler as you think . I lose more than I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not the winning . " <p> It occurred to me that maybe when I returned nothing would be changed : Defoe riding into town in a car driven by some pretty woman and his laconic father pumping gas at the station and my father standing behind the counter at the pharmacy . <p> For a moment I thought he was going to reach out and take my hand , but we just stood there , our arms at our sides . Then he got in the car . <p> Instead of driving off he hesitated ; his face , illuminated by the dashboard lights , turned toward me . <p> " You watch yourself in them swamps and jungles , " he said . <p> I started to speak but then he was gone , the taillights glowing red in the darkness . I waded into the water and started my swim to the spillway . Penelope and I would swim back and then  --  if her father 's cabin was not too far  --  we would walk through the early morning darkness to it . And alter dancing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'd sit in canvas chairs on the porch , the sweat cooling on our faces , her hand in mine , and watch the sun rise over the lake . <p> <p> By SCOTT ELY <p>
