Scene . Near a large rock on the shore of the lake fifty yards northeast of the bridge . A MAN and WOMAN talk . A SECOND MAN stands on the far shore about twenty-five yards to the south ; a SECOND WOMAN stands on the bridge , facing them . A THIRD MAN , with a bullhorn , sits in a chair on a small rock in the lake some twenty-five yards due east of the first . A CHORUS of twelve is hidden amongst the bushes and reeds on the southern shore of the lake , near the SECOND MAN . Pause . The two on the bridge appear to be a couple but are n't . FIRST WOMAN I come here every day , every single day . I come here , to this spot , every single day and every single day , every single goddamn day , it 's the same or it 's different or it rains or it 's clear or it snows or it 's bright and beautiful or it 's dark , rainy , and kinda foul .

Sometimes I think the sky is only pretending to be the sky , or that it 's a fake image of the true image of the sky , like what you see in a puddle , and that in fact there 's no true sky at all . I mean , anywhere . But I realize there probably is a true sky somewhere since if there 's an image of something there 's bound to be an object , somewhere , an object corresponding to that image , do n't you think , somewhere ?

I think there is a separate place for twisted paperclips , and too-short pencil stubs , and old newspapers , like big , dumb birds with broken wings , skittering across the pavement , the pavement of the sky ; I think there is place for bent coathangers . These places must be located up there , in the sky , because there is no other place available , no other place that empty , no other place that someone has n't laid claim to , and filled up with some kind of perfectly ordinary junk , whatever kind of junk there is that is appropriate to that kind of place , because you never know , given the people who live there , wherever , and what they look like , and what kinds of junk they like , and who they are . All that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's a crock , and the whole damn sky is just a big , fat illusion . You want to know why I think that ? * I mean when I do think that because** I do n't think that all the time , I only think that some of the time . p. 3 FIRST MAN No . ( Pause . ) Go away or I 'll call the police . FIRST WOMAN Well , the way I see it , all those stars up there , out there , all those millions upon millions of stars ; which obviously we ca n't see new because it 's day , but there 're still there , as we all know or think we know because all we actually see at night are the images of stars , not the starts themselves ; all of which means that during the daytime what we are not seeing is the image of a star  --  or stars  --  maybe even thousands of them . How can you say you 're missing much of anything if all you can be sure of is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stars because the image of something else blocks out the image of the stars ? Especially when you consider that all you see at night is the image of stars , not the stars themselves , which are far too far away for anyone ever to see them . The actual stars , I mean . It 's totally ridiculous . So , in fact , if that 's all we see , if that 's truly the case , then the whole damn sky is one big fake , one great big , vast , optical illusion . I mean , really ! ( She looks at his tire . ) FIRST MAN I had a flat tire ; over there . FIRST WOMAN Then what are you doing here , in the park ? p. 4 FIRST MAN What do you think ? I 'm going to change my goddamn tire . There 's no goddamn gas station over there ( Points east. ) , so I figure , what the hell , I walk across the park , maybe there 's a gas station over there ( Points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

FIRST MAN What business is it of yours anyway ? SECOND MAN Just curious , that 's all . I mean , I did n't mean to be nosy. * I was n't trying to intrude . Jesus , it 's a public park , you know . I mean , you do n't have no monopoly on finer feelings , buddy . I was just trying to be neighborly , so do n't mind me . I 'm just another human being , you are familiar with the species ?

Three hundred pounds of rock salt in the trunk . Parked on 69th between Lex and Park . Parked illegally . I hate parks . I 'm a freelance memory fabulist and metaphysician and card player . Failed card player . Ca n't ever go back to Atlantic City . I have a cat named Myth* and I do n't need a passport . FIRST WOMAN What a coincidence ! My hobby is myth , and my name is Kat. * Only I spell Kat with a k SECOND MAN Who 're you trying to fool ?

There 're plenty of gas stations on the East Side. * I 've seen ' em . I know . Oh , for crying out loud , what do you want me to do , give you the fucking street number , the color of the toilet seat in the men 's room ? As a general rule I can make the absolute statement : there are gas stations aplenty in the area immediately East of Central Park , even if it is hoity-toity , even if they are hoity-toity , for gas stations , I mean . I have seen them . I have walked by them .

So you just go and shove it up your tailpipe , buddy . p. 6 THIRD MAN He do n't have no car , and he do n't got no flat tire . Nobody who did n't have no flat tire would n't go and tear the wheel off'n his car without he had no jack and no wrench and no tire iron , I do n't care how strong he is , without his being a monster like some monster football player , some gigantic goon , and even if he were some fucking monster goon , why would he go and do a thing like that in the first place because it 's his car , is n't it ? And it would n't make no sense , and for that reason I do not believe his story . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me . No , I surmise this guy is in the park because he is out of work and is , in general , up to no good . This park is full of people , these days , who are out of work and up to no good and you know what I would do with all these people who are up to no good in the park ? I would say , politely , why do n't you get your collective ass out of the park and get a job or join the armed forces or at least do something that will be a service to your country and not just be a lazy good-for-nothing who does n't contribute to society and do n't got no job of real work as we folks who are responsible must do . I mean look at that look on his face .

The man is standing there next to his girlfriend , * with a flat tire  --  show Mr. **32;1922;TOOLONG the tire ( FIRST MAN does so. ) he 's minding his own business , and he 's from out of state , and therefore should be shown some courtesy as a tourist , ** and some aggressive , hostile goon like you has to show up and spoil everything . Did it not occur to you maybe he was only postponing the inevitable task of changing the tire to take advantage of the great outdoors and the splendid weather we are having , finally , after the usual awful cold and shitty and rainy weather that in this miserable nuthouse of a city passes for Spring ? p. 7 FIRST WOMAN I am not his girlfriend . FIRST MAN I am not a tourist . ( Pause . ) FIRST WOMAN Why do n't you need a passport ? FIRST @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) FIRST WOMAN I knew it , I just knew it . FIRST MAN What did you just know ? FIRST WOMAN I knew I shouldn't 've picked up that goddamn bad penny I found on the path , over there , near the big fountain . I knew it would turn out this way : bad . BAD . Bad bad . But Kat goes and does it , goes and picks up the goddamn bad penny , which I know for a fact is a bad penny because it 's tails , and when it 's tails it 's a bad penny and he who touches it is in for a bunch of bad luck , and will be eaten by trolls , or suffer the pharaoh 's curse , or be killed by the Boatman of Bow Bridge , and no good will ever come of it , that 's what I 've heard . THIRD MAN Then what the hell 's a good penny ? I mean , how can you tell the difference ? A penny 's a penny. * I do n't get it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why do n't you shut up . p. 8 FIRST WOMAN ( To the THIRD MAN . ) A good penny is one you find heads up . A bad penny is tails up . The one you pick up and pocket , the other you do n't . It 's a rule . I violated the rule by picking up the bad penny . SECOND MAN Easy enough for you , Meathead ? THIRD MAN I will not respond to that sarcasm . SECOND WOMAN ( To the FIRST WOMAN . ) There 's something the matter with you . Normal people do n't talk like you . Normal people do n't talk about the sky . Normal people do n't act crazy. * Normal people act normal , and do n't go around thinking about the curse of the pharaohs and if they do they do n't talk about it , they do n't talk about it with anyone else because they know it is shameful and a bad thought and one likely to get them in trouble with the boss , their family , and arouse suspicion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things to do with their time , better things than this . FIRST WOMAN There is not a thing wrong with me . I am a perfectly normal human being with perfectly normal hopes and wishes and aspirations and dreams and ideals . Perfectly normal in all respects . I possess a job , an apartment , the normal type clothes and shoes you would expect of one such as me . Normal . A cat , a dog , a parakeet . I have no unusual interests , except the one I mentioned before , the interest in myth . I have no abnormal desires and cravings . I believe everything I see on television and never doubt the authorities , even when others less prudent push the panic button , raise the alarm , sound the tocsin . All of it , futile . Futile . I do not believe in werewolves and vampires . I believe neither that there are alligators in the subways , nor that there are trolls in Central Park , yes , trolls , among them the hideous Boatman of Bow Bridge , hidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in regions inaccessible to normal human trespass .

I went to Big Ugly High School and played end on the Big Ugly football team , which was called the Big Ugly Metacomets . The Big Ugly Metacomets were the best football team in the state , only they were defeated in the state championship game by the team from Why Not . Why Not , Montana . They were named the Why Not Downwind Scars , and they were a wicked awful bunch , even more wicked awful than us . They stomped us good , and after that they kidnapped our mascot , a bulldog named Meathead . We all loved Meathead because he was the mascot of the Big Ugly Metacomets . And those damn Down-wind Scars from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard from no more . It was the saddest day of my life . ( Pause . ) Used to be my day job was at this site , this nuclear toxic-waste site . Facility . But this facility was actually a dump , a dump located near the town of Futile . Futile , Montana . Mainly I checked dials and stuff . A little glove-box work . A little light contamination . Routine . Nothing to worry about much , if you bear the mark of Cain on your forehead . Nah . Time to play cards in the detox chamber . Time to think about things . Big things like Time and God and Destiny and so forth . Big , mythic things . My night job was , ah , unspeakable . Days and nights in Futile made me think how happy I 'd been before , back in Big Ugly , with Meathead . Strange . p. 10 FIRST WOMAN Wow ! I ca n't believe it . You wo n't believe this , but I had a bulldog when I was growing up and guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go ahead ! Guess ! FIRST MAN I know , I know . Meathead. * Right ? Right . ( The dialogue continues as the CHORUS chants . ) CHORUS Let the world be covered with cobwebs . Let the world be covered with shadows . Let the world be covered with dead leaves . Let the world be covered with rat fur . The Dead Boatman of Bow Bridge is coming , he is coming to take the thief , take the thief in his boat to Hell , he is coming to ferry the criminal to Hell , the one who stole his penny , the one who thieved his bad penny , * the one who thoughtlessly took what did not belong to him ; that one is going down to Hell ( Repeat . ) FIRST MAN Takes all kinds , I guess . FIRST WOMAN My name is Kat , and I grew up in a remote part of the city , a part of the city considered unfashionable by those people who were our social betters , and who continually reminded us , the entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family business would be incomprehensible to most well-bred people , and therefore our neighborhood was called the Place of Solitary Shoes or the Place of Twisted Coathangers or the Place of Gruesome Doilies and no one would ever come to visit us because we gave off a strange odor that everyone found somewhat disgusting even though we washed and bathed regularly still we gave everyone who came into contact with us the creeps . So , all in all , I guess you could say I had a fairly disgusting childhood , a fairly gruesome childhood , and labored in dark spooky places assembling robot vermin and big spools of lethal twine and gruesome cheese , fake cheese , made out of spoiled vegetables and petroleum byproducts . ( Pause . ) In short , I came from a gruesome family . Everyone looked at everything too closely , and that 's why I went mad . Gruesome mom , gruesome pop , gruesome cat , gruesome dog FM : Named Meathead . Precisely : named Meathead ; a gruesome house , gruesome sofa , gruesome TV , gruesome radio , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gazebo , gruesome mailbox , gruesome garden hose , gruesome carpet , gruesome back porch , gruesome front porch , gruesome vegetable garden , gruesome doilies all of it gruesome , all of it the work of gruesome adults who look at you too closely , and find fault with all you do . So , like I say , I went crazy , then I got sane , then I went crazy , then I got sane again , then I got crazy again and got well once more then I moved out , to a more respectable part of town , learned to talk like normal people and not like someone from the gruesome neighborhood where I grew up , acquired a few skills , the kind you need to make your way through the world , as it is understood by respectable people , people who have no reason to be ashamed by the facts of their origin , where they grew up , what food they eat , the size and shape and color of their shoes , and such bad habits they might have acquired by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not used to acting normal , people who act strange . ( The choral chant stops . A long pause. ) p. 11 FIRST MAN What kind of a fool do you take me for ? SECOND WOMAN I really do n't know what you see in her . You can tell just by looking at her that she is a floozy , or homeless , or damaged goods , or at the very least a very insincere person , a person with no scruples ; and just between you and me , if I were you I would watch out she do n't lift a wallet or wristwatch or some other valuable from off of you . Maybe even that tire you got there ; she looks like the kind that would stoop to a thing like that . Vicious . Antisocial . Avaricious . Maladjusted . Possibly a drunk . Probably a loony tunes .

You are in danger , in danger of death by deadly force is what I am trying to get through your thick skull . Others may tell you this is not so , but I am a friend , even though we are not personally acquainted , and yes , I am aware that my concern may strike you as a bit peculiar ; nevertheless , it is true ; in fact , I am your only friend* and I have documents to prove this , documents which reveal a vast conspiracy against you , a conspiracy organized by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at your place of work ; all their schemes center on the total destruction of you , your happiness , sanity , the health of your cat and dog and houseplants ; the destruction of your credit , reputation , your morale , your good standing in the community , and even your self-identity and your faith in God who is over all , and who ordains all things , even vast conspiracies such as this . Do I make myself clear ? Be warned . p. 12 FIRST MAN ( To the SECOND WOMAN . ) I am telling you once and for all : we only appear to be a couple . We are emphatically not a couple now , nor have we ever been a couple , nor will we ever be a couple . So please keep your advice to yourself , I do n't need it , I do n't want it , I ca n't stand it , and to tell you the truth it 's driving me crazy so shut up and go away or I 'll call the police and have them issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away for good . Good riddance . SECOND MAN What did you mean by all that stuff , that stuff about the sky ? You , Kat . I am asking you a question , because it 's all set me thinking , * because something about what you said , something made me feel like a big , dumb bug creeping over a sheet of plate glass , looking through the glass to an infinity of sky and more sky , and allatime I was unaware of the larger implications of this stuff . I mean , I like to know where I am going , and what I am doing and that whatever I am here for , it 's not just like some bad joke , something to do with the zoo at night or some deeply twisted nightmare , I mean I am no mere insect ; I am a deeply caring individual with special skills and habits , and a fondness for things like Cuban cigars , Hawaiian shirts , and French brandy . I have always striven to be more or less honest , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even when driven nearly out of my mind with an insane desire to run amok and tear down whatever small portions of the civilized world I can lay my hands upon , without risking my job or getting hurt on dangerous machinery , or injecting some lethal substance into my veins , while all the time knowing that the moon and stars are whirling senselessly , mindlessly overhead at speeds I ca n't even imagine , much less make any sense of . It scares me , it scares the shit out of me . It scares me , and it scares me even more that what I see when I look up there , at the sky , is n't a picture of anything  --  it is n't any thing at all . And yet it is , it is everything there is  --  all jumbled up , all jumbled together in a mad merry-go-round of comings and goings , of appearing and disappearing , and none of it strictly speaking , means anything at all . Except to us down here , in our littleness and stupidity and bitterness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hell out of me even more than that ? Do you ? I mean , really , DO YOU ! ? because I do n't mind telling you I do n't get excited by things like this every day , and if you think I 'm enjoying this you are sadly mistaken and the thing is ; nothing up there in the sky has changed a bit since the time I was seven years old and first got interested in things like that . Nothing has changed . NOTHING ! Nothing up there has changed since the time of Christ , the time of the Incas , the time of the pharaohs . Nothing very much has changed for a very long time , except us . Only us ! Crummy , little , cheesy , lousy liars and con artists that we are .

For the Way leads over from the Fountains of Bethesda , where the Lord performed certain acts , acts unknown to us , across the Bow Bridge of our human unknowability , pigheadedness , and the wisenheimer attitude problem of our undeserving , slimeball cheesiness ; and scuttles into the Ramble , there , of utterly craven , totally lost , desperate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor tusk of bat , bird , weasel , porcupine , nor gnat . And we who are not who we are must forever bury the toxic waste of our hidden hates in the dark , plutonic abysm of our human hearts , and be always blessed in the empty promise of the sky that looks down upon us with a smile , a divine smile , even as she crushes us all beneath her silver foot . End of play .
