CRITICS GROUSE ABOUT HOLLYWOOD 'S LOVE OF THE tried and true , but ultimately that 's just what the audience wants . Proof : this holiday season 's movie- attendance figures . The big disappointments were all thematically adventurous : Leap of Faith ( Steve Martin as an evangelist ) , Hoffa ( Jack Nicholson as a labor leader ) , Malcolm X ( Denzel Washington as a civil rights activist ) and Toys ( Robin Williams as . . . whatever he was ) . <P> Hits : Aladdin ( the only animated offering in the pack , grabbing $114 million ) , A Few Good Men ( Tom Cruise=$55 million ) , The Bodyguard ( Kevin Costner=$88 million , despite intense critical pummeling ) and Home Alone 2 , the failure-proof sequel that has rung up $146 million , already placing it in the top three of 1992 's big earners , along with Batman Returns and Lethal Weapon 3  --  also sequels that offered more of the same . <P> The $5 billion in tickets purchased made 1992 one of Hollywood 's best years ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Translation : fewer tickets sold . Small wonder , considering such predictable bombs as Far and Away ( Cruise with a dreadful Irish accent in 19th century Oklahoma ) and Newsies ( Disney 's appalling revival of the movie-musical ) and surprising failures like The Distinguished Gentleman , featuring Eddie Murphy in a tailor- made role as a corrupt Congressman . Apparently his biggest fans wo n't accept him as anything but a sassy inner-city cop named Axel Foley .
