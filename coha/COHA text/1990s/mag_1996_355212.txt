In the steamy darkness of a summer night on the Persian Gulf , Staff Sergeant Alfredo Guerrero was making the rounds of the observation posts under his command . He stepped onto the roof of one of the apartment buildings at the Khobar Towers near Dhahran and said hello to the two other members of the U.S. Air Force security police posted there . Then something caught his eye . Below he saw a white Chevrolet Caprice pulling into a public parking lot adjacent to the compound . Nothing odd about that , but the car was being followed closely by a large tanker truck , and the two vehicles were driving slowly along the edge of the lot . Directly opposite Building 131 , where Guerrero stood watching , the Mercedes-Benz tanker backed up to the 10-ft. - high chain-link fence that separated the lot from the military area . Two men leaped out of the truck 's cab , into the waiting Caprice , and roared away . <P> " That was the clicker , " Guerrero later told TIME . " They were in a hurry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He radioed a hasty report to his headquarters , and then he and the two lookouts dashed down to the residential floor below , where they began pounding on doors and yelling , " Get out ! Get out ! " They made it only to the seventh floor before what Guerrero had feared would happen did happen . <P> The force of the bomb sheared off the outer wall of Building 131 and left a smoking crater 85 ft. across and 35 ft. deep where the truck had been parked . The shock wave blew in windows and pulverized reinforced concrete , creating a blizzard of slashing , crushing projectiles . Windows in several other buildings , some half a mile away , were also shattered . In the midst of the carnage , Guerrero came upon a dazed and wounded man and helped him down seven flights of stairs to an emergency van that had pulled up outside . While many of the hundred or more officers and enlisted personnel in Building 131 had heard the shouting and headed into the stairwell , away from the blast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospitalized . <P> The explosion prompted a painful review of what had gone wrong . Everyone had been aware of the danger since a smaller bomb killed seven people , including five Americans , at a U.S.-run training center in Riyadh , Saudi Arabia 's capital , last November . Warnings of more outrages had been coming by phone and fax for months , and security measures at military facilities had been stepped up . Troubling long-range strategic questions also demand answers . Is the rule of the royal House of Saud in more danger than the West suspected ? Does the presence of about 5,000 U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia bolster or undercut stability in the land ? Could it go the way of Iran ? Its future matters immensely because it produces 8 million bbl. of oil a day .
