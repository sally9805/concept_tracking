While lounging at the Quito Hilton before joining the swarms of peering , prodding , picture-taking ecotourists in the Gal ? pagos Islands , I picked up my guidebook to Ecuador and read a rather terrifying passage : " The islands do n't need bored visitors tramping around and wondering why they 've spent hundreds of dollars to sit on a rocky piece of lava under a searing equatorial sun to look at some squawking seabirds. " // I thought of my two daughters , who 'd probably be just as happy in the hotel sniggering at Baywatch reruns . I thought of my wife , who 'd definitely be just as happy indulging in the eucalyptus-scented sauna . I thought of the Gal ? pagos , the arid chain of volcanic islands that 's a shrine for naturalists and historians . Then I thought of Wayne and Garth salaaming to Alice Cooper in Wayne 's World : " We are not worthy ! " // What ecotourist is ? Squatting astride the equator , 600 miles west of the mainland , the islands within the national park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Darwin visited them in 1835 and more or less discovered evolution . Penguins , seals and sea lions still bask on the beaches ; marine iguanas still lumber around spewing saltwater from their nostrils like dwarf dragons ; giant tortoises , as large as four feet and 500 pounds , clank along the lava , ignoring human gawkers. // That has not always been easy to do . Humans have been wreaking havoc on the archipelago 's fragile ecology since the 16th century , when pirates and later whalers started slaughtering everything in sight . Tortoises , prized for their meat and oil , fell prey to virtually every ship that sailed in the waters . Stacked live in ships ' holds , they could survive a year or more without food or water . Today the tortoise population , once estimated at 250,000 , is down to 15,000 . Three of the islands ' 14 subspecies have been wiped out and another is on the brink of extinction . Much of the thinning was done by predators that early settlers introduced to the islands . Cats , dogs , pigs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eggs and plants that endemic wildlife live on . Though park guards have exterminated some of these interlopers , human meddling goes on . // Which is why Alex Cox , the guide on our eight-day cruise , views the islands as a touristic Neverland . " Never feed , touch or harm the animals , " he cautioned . " Never remove rocks , shells or bones . And never , ever , walk off the trail . " A native Gal ? pagan , Cox knows the flora and fauna as intimately as he knows his fellow crewmen . He knows the islands ' history , too , and tells it with considerable learning . But Gal ? pagos guides are in as anomalous a position as dude ranch cowboys . As much as they revere the place , they compromise a little bit more of its integrity with each ecotourist they bring ashore . // Ecotourism  --  the trammeling of curious crowds through relatively untrammeled habitats  --  is the oxymoron of the 1990s . It 's a closed system , catering to the rich , designed to preserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Cox . Still , " sustainable " is a slippery concept in the Gal ? pagos . Four decades ago , when the Ecuadoran government designated 97% of the territory a national park , the annual flow of tourists was 10,000 . By 1990 the number of visitors had quadrupled . // Now , with the yearly tourist population hovering around 65,000 , some tour companies have replaced their eight-cabin ketches with enormous cruise ships . " It 's economic Darwinism , " says David Gayton of Safari Tours in Quito . " The islands are being loved to death . " Gayton has dreamed up the ultimate unobtrusive Gal ? pa-tour . " We send clients a bill written on recycled paper , " he cracks . " They send money , but do n't actually come to Ecuador . In fact , they stay home . " // We went but strove to leave no trace . We did n't feed one creature , nick one rock or pocket one shell . We stuck closely to the marked paths , which often wove through nesting colonies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robin 's egg blue . Mostly , we just observed . We observed a young man in a good mood veer off the trail , grab an albatross egg and toss it in the air . We observed an old man in a bad mood kick a sea lion to see if it would roar . ( It did . ) We observed a hot , bored woman on a rocky piece of lava muttering about squawking seabirds. // Unworthy , my family may have been . But at least we were only passively destructive .
