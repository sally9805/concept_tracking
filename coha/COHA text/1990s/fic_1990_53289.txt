LAWRENCE had a mother , and then a wife , and when his wife left him for a twenty-year-old bagboy at the Kroger he swore he would never marry again , especially not to an intellectual woman like Karen Sue . " There are worse things than being alone , " he would repeat silently over his nightly chipped beef on toast , alone in front of the TV . Then he repeated his statement out loud one morning to his mother when he stopped for coffee at the main house . " There are worse things than being alone . " <p> " Tell me about it . " His mother had been widowed after thirty-five years of alleged misery . Since his father 's death Lawrence had run his mother 's farm . Each year he and his mother had had to sell off one or two lots to keep going , but it was only after Karen Sue left him that Lawrence looked upon the yearly forfeiture of the family acreage as a bad omen , the thread that would eventually unravel the heretofore well-patterned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leads its shepherd into a black hole of financial and personal entropy . He only hoped the land would last his mother 's lifetime , keep her rattling around in her big old house . " I saw them in town yesterday . She 's changed her hair . She looked gorgeous . " His mother spooned instant coffee into a cup of tepid water . Lawrence suspected that his mother lay awake at night in her huge Victorian bed with its clusters of carved cherries and nymphs hanging above her head and thought up hateful things to say . She was wrongly admired by the townspeople for being a spunky old lady , and it had spoiled her . She had been a helpless bitch when she was young ; now she was just an old helpless bitch . <p> " That 's interesting , Mother . You used to say Karen Sue was ugly . A rail , you said , a beanpole . " <p> " Times change . Thin is in . She calls herself ' Kara ' now . " <p> " A rose . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the bait . The coffee was terrible and there was something crusty on the edge of the cup . He spooned in sugar . Lawrence would have liked to remind his mother of things she had said years back when black people were swapping their slave names for African names , but since she had joined the DAR she was very touchy about accusations of bigotry . And he did n't want to change the subject ; he welcomed even the most painful tidbits of news about his ex-wife . " You 're so up on these things , Mother . It disproves theory . Old dogs are learning new tricks these days . I suppose you do n't even mind anymore the fact that they 're living in sin . " <p> " Sin is sexy . They were walking in Wal-Mart hip to hip . She looks like a kid again . " <p> " I repeat , there are worse things than loneliness . " And if he ever did it again he sure would n't marry a selfish , cruel woman like his mother . Actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been all that happy ; or all that unhappy either . If anyone had asked him before the day she left if theirs was a happy marriage he would have answered " average " or " middling " or " so-so , " not too ecstatic to get tiresome , not so complacent that they always agreed , but just about right . They had married just out of college and built a little house on the corner of the farm , the first in the row of little houses that now edged his mother 's land . His mother 's house looked like a castle surrounded by peasant cottages . " Serfs , " Karen Sue would mockingly rant . " Serfs to Mother 's fiefdom . Someday you and your mother will wake up and there wo n't be anything left but a sea of little houses around you . You 'll drown in an ocean of peasant exudate . " <p> " What are you talking about , Karen Sue ? Drown in peasant what ? " <p> " Exudate . Phlegm , spit , the nastiness you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She taught English at the county high school and then , bored , decided to go back to school and get her doctorate , commuting back and forth on the interstate to the university . She had only one semester of classes and her dissertation left when she moved out . She even took the cat . <p> She piled her few clothes , her boxes of books in the middle of the tiny living room . She moved from room to room collecting her belongings , her manner preoccupied but calm . Since going back to school she had dropped all modes of hysteria . Lawrence liked that part of her new personality , although it frustrated him when she would n't argue back . " Ca n't you see I 'm leaving ? There 's nothing more to be said . " She wore a sleeveless T-shirt . Lately she had stopped shaving her armpits . <p> " We 'll leave here if that 's what you want . My mother ca n't write a check or open a gate by herself , but I 'll leave her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Want ' has nothing to do with it . A woman should n't have to demand anything from a man . " She stuck the freshly scrubbed cat box in with Dickens and Shakespeare , wedging it with a paperback copy of Know Your Body : .4 Woman 's Guide to Sexual Pleasure . " I want my space . I want self-determination . Freedom may be just a delusion of the small mind , but for once I 'll take ' small ' over this stultification . " She gestured widely  --  the little living room , the farm , his mother 's crumbling mansion beyond the window . <p> What he did n't say , what he should have said in retrospect , because at the time he had n't wanted to be trite or out of touch with the times , was that it was his marriage , too , and that she had had freedom . They had n't had children because she wanted to keep her options open . He had supported her going back to school . Okay , admittedly he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was only a manager of a dwindling , unprofitable farm . <p> In fact , dupe that he was , he had n't even known about the bagboy or the apartment over the pool hall until after Karen Sue had left , until his mother heard it . She got her details from DAR meetings . On Flag Day his mother got the news that his ex-wife and the bagboy were sometimes careless about pulling the shades . And the apartment looked over the main street of town . They were advertising . Lawrence no longer went into town . His mother bought his groceries . <p> " Not bad . Not bad-looking at all . In fact , he 's a hunk . A very mature twenty-year-old , I 'd say . " Lawrence 's mother set the sack of groceries on the counter of the little kitchen . " I certainly can see what Karen Sue sees in him . " A greasy strand of hair had worked out from under her wig . <p> " Kara , you mean Kara . " <p> " What ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Not a ' what . ' A ' who . ' Her name is Kara now , remember ? You are n't beginning to forget things are you , a touch of Alzheimer 's ? And why are you still trading at Kroger ? Why not the Piggly Wiggly ? " <p> " It 's your scandal , not mine . I wo n't let anybody run me off from a store where I 've always shopped . It 's only natural that I notice how good-looking he is . " <p> " So you 're into sizing up bagboys , are you ? What 's this , a national craze , bagboy ogling ? " <p> " He 's not a bagboy anymore . He 's a meat trainee . " <p> " What , is he learning to be a pork chop ? " <p> " Do n't be jealous , Lawrence . Someday he 'll take over the meat counter . He says that it 's a lot of responsibility learning all the cuts , controlling the percentage of fat in hamburger , a big job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were limits . Where had simple , basic decency fled ? " My mother actually chews the fat with my ex-wife 's lover ? " He felt himself to be a man drawn out to sea on a tidal wave and then tossed back upon his native shore where everything familiar had changed or disappeared . Only the sharp rocks and the grit of sand against his flesh remained . <p> " Rog and I have a sort o bond , something in common . " <p> " Obviously , you and Rog are both perverts . " <p> " If you and Kara had been able to have a baby I would be his grandmother and Roger would be his stepfather . Do n't forget to close the front gate tonight . " <p> " When in my life have I forgotten to close the gate ? " What had become of good women ? A mother who tormented her only child . A wife who loved words and language and ideas running off with a meat clerk . He avoided town and a possible encounter with Karen Sue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a red Toyota ( possibly hers ) as he traveled the interstate to pick up feed or a tractor part from the city . He sensed the failure was his , not his personally , but his part in the history of the male sex , a slight , a persecution , a bigotry so subtle , so ingrained that he might never meet it face to face . <p> He watched more television . A new serial came on Masterpiece Theatre . Lawrence had missed the first episode , falling asleep during the introduction as Alistair Cooke was explaining English primogeniture . Coming in late on the plot , Lawrence was confused . The young man 's wife had died in last Sunday 's episode . Probably childbirth or a hunting accident , the standard devices in romantic fiction for getting rid of the young scion 's wife . <p> The husband walks on a rocky beach . He wears Wellingtons , tweed jacket , a slouch hat . In a closeup the actor 's face is pensive and stricken . A Cornish shingle , or maybe Welsh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ custom , not topography . Certain English words were better than their American counterparts : lorry , lift , shingle . Karen Sue could recite " Dover Beach " by heart . She would stand at the bedroom window and pretend that his mother 's house was the French shore and quote from Matthew Arnold , " down the vast edges drear / And naked shingles of the world . " Now she did n't even lower her shades . A young girl on one of those big drafty-looking English riding horses gallops up to the young man on the beach . Lawrence envied the guy in the story . How much easier to lose a wife to the mysteries of death than the vagaries of desertion and divorce . His mother 's DAR buddies would have sent him casseroles , introduced him to their granddaughters and nieces , indulged his grief . It was n't one of Masterpiece Theatre 's better efforts . He got up from the couch and went to the kitchen to make supper . In the cupboard his chipped bee was down to two jars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> On Monday night Lawrence drove the thirty miles to the suburban shopping center . The grocery was unfamiliar and intimidating . He had never done his own shopping and , since Karen Sue had probably met her meat trainee in the Kroger , the engulfing yeasty smell of bread as he entered the strange store suggested concupiscence and betrayal . He wasted no time , wheeling his cart down the aisle flagged " canned meats and gourmet . " He took from the shelf enough chipped beef to last him , as he calculated , two weeks . He headed for the checkout counter . In line he felt a tap on his shoulder . <p> " Excuse me , " the young woman standing behind him said , " but I have been looking everywhere for the new dip recipe with chipped bee in it , and when you passed me back by the detergents and I saw all that chipped beef in your cart , I said to myself that there is a man who must know the recipe . " She was an attractive young woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of rich surfaces and textures , a vibrant brocade shot through with gold . She wore much jewelry and her hair fluffed in a style that was either twenty years out of date or so new that Lawrence did not know of its resurrection . Its color and shape resembled a candle flaming upward . <p> " Sorry , but I do n't know any recipes . I just make a cream sauce . " <p> " You eat that much SOS ? How dull for you , how sad . Now I am a gourmet cook and , although I try to be modest , there is no sense in being foolish about the talent God gave you . Let me give you some suggestions that will put some zip in your SOS . " <p> It had been a long time since Lawrence had assessed a woman in regard to his feelings for her as a woman , but this young woman with the flamelike hair seemed neither too smart nor cruel , and the rich exuberance of her appearance appealed to him . Already the checkout clerk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scanner and hit the repeat button fourteen times . He had to be quick , but he did n't want to give the impression of mistaking her kindness for a come on . He asked , " May I buy you a drink ? We could sit and talk and you could give me your recipes and do me a great favor . " <p> " Thank you , no , I do n't drink . I do not believe in drinking . It clouds your mind and ruins your taste buds . It is a sin against the temple of the body , but there is a lovely little ice cream parlor in the mall that has the best amaretto fudge . " <p> They sat at a little wire table in tiny wire chairs and ate ice cream . She had been widowed three years before when her husband had run his truck off a mountain in North Carolina . She had received many offers of marriage since , but none of them had felt right . " Before I got married , I went to college . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courses were dumb and it bored me to read and to sit there listening to professors talk about things that did n't matter . I was very fat and what I really wanted was a husband . I prayed to God , ' God , send me a good man . ' I flunked out of college and went home and joined Weight Watchers and enrolled in beauty school and lost sixty-three and one-half pounds before I reached my goal . My daddy was a farmer , but he went to auctions and bought things by the gross or things nobody else wanted . He ran ads in the paper and one day Ralph answered an ad for some machinery parts and I opened the door . Four months later we were married and were happy as hogs until his rig went off that mountain . He was carrying a load of toilet paper to Atlanta and everybody who saw the wreck said it was perfectly beautiful . The mountain looked like it had been decorated with streamers of crepe paper . But I tried not to grieve because the Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said to myself , ' Gwyn , there is a purpose to all this . ' I started my own beauty shop and bought my condo with the insurance money . And you said you were divorced ? " <p> Lawrence noted the thickness of her thigh spread across the metal stool and thought of Karen Sue 's thinness ; yet he was warmly disposed to this fudge-loving woman who lived life at the surface and found it rich and pleasant . He said , " My wife and I were very happy until she went back to college for a Ph.D . and ran off with a twenty-year-old grocery clerk . " <p> " Is your ex-wife 's name Kara and did she used to wear her hair long , because I 've got a new customer who had hair down to her .... " Gwyn demurred at the word on the tip of her tongue , " butt , if you 'll excuse my French . I cut it all off and gave her a blow-and-go . A beautiful girl , but I am not surprised you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her going back to school , " Lawrence said in his own defense . " I encouraged her . I kept her options open . " <p> " And now you wish you had n't . Women were a lot better off before they tried to think . Because when women try to think like men they screw up . " <p> Maybe it was what he wanted to hear , a salve of conscience , because he suddenly felt awash in the oblivion of surfaces and textures , the rich fudge ice cream , the sleek wire and plastic of the ice cream parlor , the shoppers carrying their packages in the mall as they strolled under the palm trees and around the fountains , the rich brocade of Gwyn 's thighs . <p> Gwyn continued , " A lot of girls like that come in the shop . They do n't know what they want . When Rog comes into the shop with Kara all the girls go ' ooh ' and ' ahh ' under their breath and wink at each other and carry on like fools because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a woman with good common sense , would n't touch a guy like that with a ten-foot pole , and that 's something a woman like Kara never understands . She thinks she has missed something in life and because she has n't been looking she grabs the first hunk that comes along for a roll in the hay , excuse my French . " <p> Could this be happening , Lawrence wondered , sitting in a mall and discussing with a lovely stranger the woman he had shared his life with for ten years , the slender , sharp-tongued girl who had stood at the bedroom window of their little home and pretended the lights from his mother 's house were the coast of France and quoted poetry . How to objectify such a situation and thereby understand his and Karen Sue 's past ? Was there logic in what Gwyn was saying ? Had Karen Sue been a victim of her own arrogance , taken a young lover to defy her culture , made a fool of herself , or did she love the boy , had she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convention to the wind ? In either case , according to Gwyn , a prediction of failure . Poor foolish Kara . He turned to Gwyn , " Would you like to have dinner on Saturday night ? " <p> " As long as I get home fairly early . I go to church on Sunday morning . " <p> On Saturday Lawrence drove to the city to take Gwyn to dinner . She met him at the door in a chic silky pants outfit the same self-conscious color as her eyes . She looked much younger than he had first thought , younger than himself , or Karen Sue for that matter . " I 've cooked for us tonight . Why waste the money when I 'm a great cook ? " The next Saturday he took her out and the following weekends they alternated between eating out and eating in . Gwyn knew all the little out-of-the-way great places to eat . The food was exotic and off-priced , always a great buy for great quality , as were her clothes , the furnishings in her condo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glitzy that bordered on envy , would have loved Gwyn 's decor , the pastel Chinese rug , the rococo gold mirrors , the huge bed with its acres of moire and brocade . He did n't tell his mother about Gwyn . <p> He watched Masterpiece Theatre on Sunday night . The young man and the girl on the horse are having an affair . She proves to be the daughter of the young man 's oldest enemy . The girl 's brother is eating dinner in a cavernous hall when one of his henchmen arrives and tells him that his sister is shacked up with the young man in a peasant 's cottage . The scene shifts to the cottage and the girl , who is very dark and big-nosed in an English way , tells the young man she is pregnant and her father will never allow them to marry . He vows his love ; they will elope to France . They embrace and suddenly the door is thrown open and in walks the brother with pistol in hand , fires , but the girl flings herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the bullet . The henchman rides off to tell the sheriff that the young man has gotten the girl pregnant and has murdered her . The last scene is the young man on the shore climbing into a dinghy to escape the law and the false accusation of murder . The acting and the scenery was , as always , well done , but the story was garbage , a potboiler . <p> One Sunday morning his mother met him at the gate . " You 're getting fat . Do n't bother yourself trying to get out of the truck . I 'll get the gate for you , Mr. Chubby Hips . I hate to see a young man waddle . " She was out in the front field pretending to chop weeds . She had an old scarf wound around her head , and she picked at a thistle so it would look like she was really working and not just waiting for him . " You did n't come home last night . Your lights did n't come on . " <p> " The progress of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he yelled at her as he drove through the gate . <p> The next Sunday morning his mother was at the gate again , chipping at the thistle . " Just getting home , Mr. Tomcat ? I heard at the DAR meeting last week that you were seen with a blond floozy at the Golden Szechuan Gardens . It 's disgraceful . You are making your poor widowed mother a laughingstock . " <p> " I thought you admired Karen Sue for doing her own thing . I would have thought that you would be delighted that I have found a life of my own . Are you going to open the gate or do I have to get out and do it myself ? " <p> " You drove her to Roger 's arms . You could have made attempts to get her back . " <p> " I could have left you , the farm  --  " which was n't exactly the truth , or maybe it was in the larger sense . If he had left years ago , things would have undoubtedly been different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction . " Do n't shift your responsibilities to me , Mister . You would n't have children , who knows , maybe you could n't . If you had given me a grandson , seeing how you have disgraced me , I would wish him dead . At least you could have your floozy in private . " She was crying now . She pulled the scarf from her head and with it made muddy smears down her cheeks . <p> Lawrence got the gate himself " Do n't be jealous of my happiness , " he said meanly as he got back in the truck . <p> His happiness , his joy . Sex with Gwyn was beyond his most exotic fantasies . God , fortunately , approved of all sexual positions and inventions , provided of course it was between two people in Christian union , not strictly legal union , spiritual union . She moved beneath , atop ; around , lighting votive candles , murmuring in the speech of tongues . If love with Karen Sue had been driving , tidal , hard , unconquering , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sex with Gwyn was topographical , a glider ride above the verdant plain , the undulant hills , a weight-watched dream , a zaftig fifteen pounds over goal , and she let him fall asleep unquestioned afterwards . If he had an objection it was a slight one ; he had to leave her rococo bed and silken sheets in time for her to go to Sunday School . <p> Lawrence had missed several episodes of Masterpiece Theatre , the adventures of the young man on the continent who returns to England , now middle-aged and wealthy , and under the name he had assumed when he fled England years before . At a ball he meets and falls in love with a beautiful young woman who turns out to be the daughter of the man who shot his sister in the cottage , therefore also the granddaughter of his old adversary and niece of his old love . <p> Dumb ; Lawrence wished they would do a classic and not this romantic shit . He got up and made himself SOS ; he had yet to put the Dijon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had suggested in the cream sauce . He wondered if in real life the young man would have wanted to return to England . <p> On Saturday night it was Gwyn 's turn to cook , but she had had a hard day at the shop and was tired . They tried a new Persian restaurant in an old section of the city where the old brick storefronts were being sandblasted and the interiors were done in magenta and puce with ferns hanging from the ceilings . It was one of the few places he and Gwyn had eaten that Karen Sue would have approved of . The vegetables and rice were healthy foods and it was , however spurious , a cross-cultural experience . <p> " This khoresht is wonderful , not too much olive oil , " Gwyn said , forking a delicate bite of eggplant and tomato into her mouth . <p> " Really ? " Lawrence said . With Gwyn he was always surprised just how pleasurable and easy life could be . <p> " They 're not Christians , are they ? " Lines formed around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her . <p> " Who ? " <p> " Persians . What do they do besides make beautiful rugs ? " <p> " They also make delicious khoresht . " " I 'm serious . Tell me about the Persians . " <p> He could n't imagine having this kind of conversation with Karen Sue . But comparisons were unfair and to be avoided : apples and oranges . " Persians are Iranians and , no , they are n't Christians , they 're Moslems . " <p> " No wonder they 're so nutty . If they had God like we do they would n't always be killing each other and everybody else over there . They make their women wear those silly veils . Can you imagine going around with your face covered up all the time ? " It was ridiculous to think a face like Gwyn 's should ever be covered up . " But they sure can cook , ca n't they ? " <p> " And make rugs . " He wondered if mockery was inevitable : a world of pleasure and good nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would have to curb himself . <p> Gwyn had n't taken offense ; she changed the subject . " Do you think I should cut my hair ? " <p> Some time in the night Lawrence woke in Gwyn 's bed with a sense of loss and despair . The scene he had dreamed had the visual and scripted authority of television and not the random confusion of reality . Perhaps he had n't really dreamed it , but had forced the imagery in the nebulous in-between of sleep and coming fully awake : Karen Sue stands at the bedroom window of their tiny house , staring out across the pasture in the direction of his mother 's house . She is naked , they have just made love , her lean body silhouetted by the security light behind the barn , and in the distance the lights on the side porch his mother has forgotten to turn off . <p> She is quoting Arnold , " ' And we are here as on a darkling plain . ' It 's true , is n't it ? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one source of their arguments  --  she believes his sleepiness after sex is a kind of indifference , an insensitivity , and he always rebuts that males are by nature exhausted after sex , a fall in the hormone level or something , a fact he has read but can not fully recall . <p> " Arnold was right . There is no certainty , no joy , no love , no light , only each other . " <p> " I thought you were through with your Victorian poetry class . " He is awake enough now to appreciate the fineness of her body . She has always reminded him of jonquils in spring , a fine porcelain , art nouveau . Her long hair falls in great loose waves , the slightly convex slant of her breast is still girlish . He is filled with love for her body , but why must her mind always grind and grate against his state of well-being ? <p> She says in the dark , " It reduces the human connection to a kind of companion dog status . " <p> Fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadow conjured by his own guilt , but he also had the painful sense that it would become a kind of tableau , a mantra of grief his mind would train itself to , to ease the truth that Karen Sue had grown hairy armpits and run off with a twenty-year-old kid from the grocery store without having the decency to tell him . <p> For breakfast Gwyn fixed croissants and an omelette with mushrooms and marinated artichokes . She moved elegantly from stove to table in her gold-threaded caftan . " Something is bothering me . We need to talk about it , " she said . <p> " I was enjoying this breakfast and the fact I did not have to think about anything . " <p> " What I was thinking was that what we are doing is not exactly ethical . " <p> " You want me to marry you ? Has that become a problem ? " <p> " Everything in good time . If it is to be , it will be . I trust in Providence . No , I was talking about doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having a relationship with her ex-husband without telling her , and telling her would make me really uncomfortable . You think I ought to recommend another shop ? " <p> " Whatever you want , only whatever you say , please convey the idea that I am a real stud . " <p> As he drove home on the interstate , the dream image of his ex-wife at the bedroom window ran through his head . Kara , Kara , Kara  --  and why not call her that , why not let all the perverse romantic longing in his soul hang out and call her by that silly name ? Why could n't his mind retreat to the pleasures of khoresht and mushroom and artichoke omelettes ? Live for surface and texture , skim the tops of the waves , live and be whole , thoughtless and content . <p> His mother was waiting for him at the gate . She neither held a hoe nor wore the dispirited headrag . Even at a distance her movements were distressed . She waved him down ; how did she think he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt remorse ; his mother was old , losing it . He would be kinder . <p> " You have n't heard the news ? " She hooked her hands , white-knuckled , on the opened window of the truck . " On the radio . I just heard . They said a tractor trailer lost control on the interstate . Karen Sue is dead . " <p> Gwyn called that night . Her heart was with him . What could she do ? What could she do ? It was so sad , and considering everything , so awkward . Roger had called her , asked her to do Kara 's hair . What could she say , Kara had been her customer . But if he objected , had any problems with it , she would get one of the other girls to go to the funeral home . <p> He did n't have any qualms . But why would the dead want their hair dressed ; he did n't say this to Gwyn , who would not understand . <p> He watched Masterpiece Theatre . The girl 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother called to tell him visitation would be tomorrow night , the funeral Tuesday at ten . <p> The young man , now middle-aged , marries the girl . In the last shot the young man and the girl walk arm in arm down the beach . Gulls fly overhead , a long pan of the sea . In his mind Kara , still with long hair , stands at the window . On a darkling plain . She is a myth already . <p> His mother called back : he would n't dare not go . If he wanted to be remembered in her will , he would go to the funeral . <p> Gwyn called again : she had thought about it and decided they should n't appear together as a couple at the funeral home . " It would n't look exactly right , not that there 's anything wrong with what we 're doing , but it would n't look very classy . " <p> To avoid having to make idle conversation with Rog , Karen Sue 's family , mutual acquaintances , Lawrence chose to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The funeral home director recognized Lawrence . He asked in an unctuous but kind voice , " Would you prefer to sit in the family section or in general mourning ? " <p> He chose the latter , keeping his eyes off the corpse until he was seated toward the back of the room . He had n't seen Karen Sue since she had cut her hair and perhaps the style had been more becoming in life . A hand patted his shoulder . He turned . Mrs. Snider , a DAR friend of his mother 's . " So sorry , dear boy . She looks perfectly beautiful , like she has just fallen asleep . " She looked to Lawrence as dead and artificial as all the other dead people he had ever seen , not the natural dead of a cow or a cat or a bird who is allowed to bloat and dessicate and withdraw from life in gradual decay , the collapse of the shell , but dead in a stuffed , store-dummy way . It was n't the Kara who stood at the bedroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meandering song . Kara , Kara , Kara . <p> With hesitancy Lawrence averted his eyes from the casket to the ell where the family was seated . The meat trainee sat self-conscious and stricken between Karen Sue 's mother and brothers . Grief , or the role of grief , must have made him look even younger than he was , . He hardly seemed the competitor that Lawrence had so carefully avoided . To someone who did n't know the situation , the boy might have been mistaken for the son of the corpse , not the lover . Whatever had Kara been thinking , taking up with such an innocent-looking boy  --  was it love or the companionship of a lap dog , lust or the desperation of looking out over life 's abyss ? He would , of course , never know ; all he knew was that in some part it was his failure . <p> And then he saw his mother had seated herself in the family section , the row behind Kara 's family and the boy , and when she caught his eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empty seat she had obviously saved . The way she inclined her head and lifted her brow indicated that she was both flattered by her position at the funeral and furious with embarrassment that her son was not taking part . Everyone in town would be saying tomorrow what a courageous , tough old bird his mother was . <p> Just as the music toned down to a hushed sob and the undertaker was approaching the casket to close it , the signal for the service to begin , Gwyn made her entrance . She entered from the farthest door so that her elegant getup could be seen and appreciated by the greatest number of mourners , a beautiful woman in a beautifully tailored black suit . She had even worn a hat , a black cloche sweeping deeply over one eye ; she looked more like a grieving society widow than hairdresser to the corpse and friend of the ex , Lawrence thought , pleased that his mother could not help but admire Gwyn 's style . She approached the casket and , with an intake of breath , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have been a quick , professional exchange with the undertaker who stood to one side waiting to lower the lid . Gwyn seated herself at the very back of the family section , discreetly dividing herself from the family by the rows of empty seats . As she sat , the slit in her stylish skirt showed a topography of well-shaped , black-stockinged leg . She dabbed at the corners of her eyes . Lawrence did not doubt her grief . Neither did he criticize her for seating herself in the family section . One who lived in the rich texture and flow of life and by the good will of Providence was not guilty of conscious hypocrisy . Gwyn sincerely grieved that Kara had been denied her life ; she probably also grieved for Rog , for himself . But it was no reason to miss a chance to look good . <p> His mother , however , had maneuvered herself into the family section to lay another stone of guilt upon his breast , to call attention to her reputed gutsiness . He watched his mother turn in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He hoped envy of Gwyn 's elegant surface was clogging his mother 's arteries . <p> The young minister stepped to the flower-engulfed lectern and began the sermon , the standard eulogy for women , the passage from Proverbs : the virtues of woman as wife and mother , the keeper of the house , her price above rubies . At the rubies part Gwyn nodded , her black hat moving up and down with an unstudied elegance , a metaphor she could comprehend . The inappropriateness of the sermon struck Lawrence as odd , then ludicrous and therefore more suitable to Kara 's memory than if the preacher had chosen the right words to eulogize his ex-wife . The minister was young enough to know better . Had he chosen the sermon because he knew nothing of Kara ? After all , she was hardly a churchgoer . Or because he knew enough details of her life to gloss over the irregularities ? It struck Lawrence with sudden , sweet grief that the one who would have most appreciated the silly sermon was Kara . <p> The service closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the French doors to the waiting hearse . Lawrence chose not to go to the cemetery . He already had his mantra of grief , Kara at the bedroom window quoting Matthew Arnold , questioning , questioning , yet not entirely fantasy . Anyway , he needed to get back to the farm . His mother had probably left the gate open . <p> <p> By LUCINDA HARRISON COFFMAN <p>
