Life seems different when you are looking down the barrel of a gun  --  more focused , urgent . That is the way Zhu Rongji , China 's Premier , likes it . Zhu , 70 , is a risk taker , a breed apart in the Chinese leadership . In Beijing they call him Zhu Fengzi , Madman Zhu , as he crashes through the rickety communist superstructure in the name of reform , laying off millions of workers from state-owned enterprises , terrorizing corrupt officials , having smugglers shot . On a good day they call him Zhu Laoban , Zhu the Boss , the only man capable of imposing order on an economy of 1.3 billion money-hungry people snarled in one of the greatest economic traffic jams the world has ever seen . Discipline has always been Zhu 's touchstone , from his early days as a lowly planning official to his current position as China 's fiscal field marshal . When he was mayor of Shanghai in 1988 , two relatives asked him over dinner to bend strict residency laws so they could come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , according to another family member present , saying , " What I can do , I have done already . What I can not do , I will never do . " <P> The moment the mad boss steps off his Air China jet in Los Angeles this week on the first stage of a scheduled American tour , he knows he will be in the cross hairs of U.S. anger at China 's dismal human-rights record and allegations of nuclear espionage . " Let Americans vent their anger , " said Zhu in a press conference last month . " I will go to tell the truth . " <P> But the truth is not pretty : a Chinese crackdown on domestic dissent harsher than anything since Tiananmen in 1989 ; allegations of a concerted campaign of espionage in U.S. nuclear labs ; an American trade deficit with China of $57 billion that is second only to the nation 's deficit with Japan ; and a brewing showdown over providing Taiwan with defense systems against China 's ballistic-missile buildup . Relations between Washington and Beijing are frostier than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are even talking as if China were the new cold war enemy . <P> Having reached threescore and 10 years , Zhu should be resting on his achievements . But in fact he is taking on the weight of U.S.-China tensions just as his own economy is teetering on the edge of breakdown . Time is short . " Black hairs have already turned to gray , " he said last month , expressing his frustration at the slow pace of negotiations with the U.S. for China 's entry into the World Trade Organization . He could have been referring to his own life story , an ever more difficult struggle against the forces of disintegration , anarchy and corruption that could yet rip China apart . <P> Tall and sharp , with the features of a falcon , Zhu dominates meetings with his quick mind  --  his IQ " must be 200 , " Deputy U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers once said . Zhu has a Rolodex memory , endless energy and an overpowering impatience . He is not a man that one likes , but " a man that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kuan Yew . Above all , Zhu is a man in a hurry , with a mission to make up for lost time , both for himself and for China .
