<p> Without an incumbent in the District 6 race for a seat on the Clayton County Board of Education , eight candidates are trying to distinguish themselves with the area 's 9,162 voters . <p> Judy Taylor , who has served for eight years on the board , is not seeking re-election . " It 's become such a time-consuming job , and I want to spend more time with my family , " said Mrs. Taylor , who has served as board chairman for the past two years . <p> To those who would like to take her place , Mrs. Taylor says to be prepared to give more time and effort than they think possible . <p> " It takes hours and hours of work , " she said . " It 's easy to sit on the outside and look in and say I would do this and that , but it changes when you actually become a board member . <p> " It 's not something you can do in a small amount of time , " Mrs. Taylor said . " And you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of common sense . " <p> The candidates for Mrs. Taylor 's seat represent a variety of views and backgrounds , but most talk about the need to rebuild a perceived loss of trust with taxpayers . <p> The board has been under fire for the past year for squabbling about issues such as the way sex education should be taught and how money should be spent . <p> " We need an end to the bickering , " said John Barrow , who serves as a room dad one day a week at Kilpatrick Elementary , where his 6-year-old son is a student . " It will take a team effort to reach a common goal . " <p> The 38-year-old pharmacist said management skills he learned in a previous job at Wal-Mart will help him build cooperation among board members . <p> Being married to a teacher for 16 years helps him understand what goes on in the classroom , he says , and he wants to keep student-teacher ratios down " because that 's one area you can really have an impact on students . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this will affect the child in the classroom , " Mr. Barrow said . " I think I 'm a pretty good combination of PTA mom and businessman put together . " <p> An unresponsive board also prompted Cindy Cathy , a 36-year-old mother of five , to run . She sees the board 's role as that of a visionary and goal-setting body . <p> " I think they 've fallen down on that role , " said Mrs. Cathy , who has a master 's degree in education from Georgia State University . " I think we need to work together as a team . People need to be able to look to us to help rather than pulling each other down . " <p> Mrs. Cathy said she would like to build on the Partners in Education program and get businesses more involved . <p> And she would like to make sure art , physical education and music teachers are available at each elementary school to give planning time to regular classroom teachers " who are crying out for it . " <p> To Joy Cavin , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through PTA and education advisory groups , the key is being sensitive to the community and spending tax dollars wisely . <p> " I have heard so many people say they 've lost confidence in the board , " said the 41-year-old homemaker and community volunteer . " For most , it 's taking both parents working to maintain a family , and they just want to make sure their money is spent well . That 's the responsibility of a good board member . " <p> Mrs. Cavin , who has three children ranging in age from 10 to 20 , is emphasizing the commitment she has shown to public education as she goes door-to-door in her district reminding voters that the July 21 primary is the time to vote for school board candidates . The non-partisan race will not be on the ballot in November . <p> For Russ Griffeth , a lack of cohesiveness and direction on the board , prompted the 42-year-old air traffic controller to enter the race . <p> " My slogan is responsive , responsible and resourceful , " said the father of four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listen to people , and I will follow through . If I tell people I 'll do something , I 'll do it , and if I tell them I ca n't , I 'll give them the reasons why . " <p> With a degree in industrial management from Georgia Tech , Mr. Griffeth said he would bring a business perspective to the board that would be useful , especially in the budget process . And he believes that his work as an equal employment opportunity counselor resolving disputes will help him do the same on the board . <p> For Judy Jones , the issue is accountability . <p> After being a classroom teacher for 21 years , Mrs. Jones said she should be able to bring an insider 's perspective to the board . <p> " The board has spent more time on details of the sex education curriculum than the budget and that disturbs me , " said Mrs. Jones , who has a 16-year-old son at Mount Zion High School . " I think the taxpayers are more interested in the budget and wasteful spending . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the school system , would also like to change the grading system that she believes places Clayton students at an unfair disadvantage with students from other systems . For example , 92-100 is an A in Clayton schools , while at many others , 90-100 is an A. <p> To Frank Nichols , a retired Federal Aviation Administration radar technician , the school system represents the way to make the world a better place . With his two children grown , Mr. Nichols sees this as an opportune time to serve his community . <p> " I feel like if we 're going to solve the problems of society we 're going to have to start with the schools , " said Mr. Nichols , a five-time president of the PTA/PTO at B.C. Haynie Elementary and a soccer coach for 23 years . <p> If elected , he would like to concentrate on decreasing the dropout rate by expanding the night-school curriculum and the after-school programs to the middle schools . Mr. Nichols would also like more emphasis placed on the vocational program . <p> " We go a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime , welfare , drugs - if we can keep kids in school and prepare them to earn a living , " Mr. Nichols said . <p> The two main themes of Stephenie Turnipseed 's campaign are improving work incentives for teachers so the system can hire and keep the best qualified educators and increasing the level of trust between residents and the board . <p> Mrs. Turnipseed , who serves in the PTA and on a school advisory panel , is concerned that qualified teachers might leave the system or not come to Clayton because they do not get paid for accrued sick leave the way they are in other counties . <p> The mother of three believes she can help improve communication among board members and instill trust by showing residents they will be listened to when they have concerns . <p> To help do that , the 37-year-old insurance agent would hold informal forums where board members and the community could discuss the issues in a non-confrontational manner . <p> " We want to improve communication so that the community will reap the benefits , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . " <p> The need to get involved in the system that is helping to educate her children prompted Susan Warren to seek election to the board . <p> As a budget analyst for Forces Command United States Army , Mrs. Warren believes her experience would be beneficial in preparing the school system 's budget , which she says suffers from a lack of " forecasting . " <p> " They need someone who is a professional as far as the budget is concerned , " said Mrs. Warren , who has a bachelor 's degree in math and chemistry from Alabama State University . She also taught high school math and remedial math at the college level . " I have a feel for what 's happening on both sides of the fence . " <p> The 43-year-old mother of two daughters said she would like to make sure the Clayton residents are aware of what the board is doing by sending out a newsletter or putting the meetings on cable television . <p> " If people do n't understand what is going on , they 're not just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If I 'm going to be a voice for the people , then I want them to understand what is going on , and they need to be able to tell me what they want . " John Barrow
