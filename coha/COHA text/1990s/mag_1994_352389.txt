The man who wrote last year 's most memorable and original movie score  --  for Jane Campion 's The Piano  --  was not even nominated for an Academy Award . That says a lot about the Oscars , but it also says something about Michael Nyman , a composer who has never quite received his due . Whether writing for films or turning out concertos , string quartets , ballets and chamber operas , the English critic turned composer is a cult figure on both sides of the Atlantic who yearns for wider acceptance . " I 've had to contend with a certain amount of envy and puffy-nosed disapproval , " he says . " I can do a concert at Festival Hall in London and get a standing ovation , which does n't happen much in new music . And there will always be a few sour-faced critics who sit around puzzled and angered and mystified . " <P> That is all changing . The swift success of both Campion 's protofeminist film and Nyman 's lush , haunting score ( more than 1.5 million CDs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sour faces . Previously , Nyman was best known for the music he wrote for the idiosyncratic director Peter Greenaway ( The Cook The Thief His Wife &; Her Lover ) and for his own superb 1987 opera , The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat , based on Oliver Sacks ' best-selling book about neurological disorders . On a recent tour of North America with his 10- piece chamber orchestra , the Michael Nyman Band , the 50-year-old composer drew hip audiences and packed houses for programs of his recent works , highlighted by The Piano Concerto , a concert version of the film score . <P> All this is something of a triumph for someone who , just two decades ago , viewed composition from the other side of the musical fence . As a critic for the New Statesman and the Spectator , Nyman was a trenchant observer of the avant-garde ( in 1968 he coined the term minimal music to describe the emerging Minimalist movement ) and in 1974 brilliantly surveyed the field in his book <P> Experimental Music : Cage and Beyond . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Music and at King 's College , London , with the early-music specialist and harpsichordist Thurston Dart  --  concluded that an even better way to affect the fortunes of contemporary music was to write it himself . In 1976 he composed incidental music for a play by Italian librettist Carlo Goldoni at Britain 's National Theatre . He quickly found his own Minimalist style in In Re Don Giovanni ( 1976 ) , and when Greenaway came calling for the first of their 10 films together , One to One Hundred , Nyman found his true pitch . <P> In one sense , he has never left criticism behind . His scores are replete with references to other music , and he uses the source material as the launching point for his own rhythmically relentless , acerbically orchestrated commentaries . " Music , " he says , " is power , passion , pulse , pain . " In the psychologically astute The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat , for example , Nyman used a Schumann song , Ich grolle nicht , as the musical foundation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : unable to synthesize visual images , the man relied on Schumann 's music to help him apprehend the world . In The Piano , Scottish folk tunes suffused the keyboard reveries that gave the mute heroine Ada her soaringly distinctive if wildly anachronistic voice : the result was a blend of rigorous Minimalism , frank Romanticism and the listener-friendly ecstasies of New Age music .
