<p> Red Hot Chili Peppers , Silverchair , the Flaming Lips <p> Saturday 's show is postponed and a new date will be announced <p> All tickets will be honored for the new date <p> There 's a thing or two you do n't know about the Red Hot Chili Peppers ' red hot guitarist , Dave Navarro . Sure , everyone knows he kicked his heroin habit and has been clean for the past four years . But he 's a major Type A personality who is , in his own words , " very anal-retentive . " <p> " I am probably the most anal-retentive person I know when it comes to cleanliness and order , " Navarro said , calling from what he assured us was his spotless Los Angeles home . " I 'm like that on the road as well . When I check into a hotel room , I put all the room service cards and hotel pamphlets in a drawer , then I hang up all my clothes and put everything in the closet and then I take all my toiletries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wake up , I make my bed . <p> " My girlfriend pokes fun at me for that , but she appreciates it at the same time . When I 'm alone  --  whether in a hotel or in bed at home  --  that 's when I want reality to stop and I want my own time to escape . And it 's hard for me to escape when a room 's cluttered with reality . " <p> The former Jane 's Addiction guitarist 's sense of order is put to the test when the Chili Peppers take the stage . His first major gig with the band was at Woodstock ' 94 , where the musicians all wore light-bulb-head masks . <p> Known for their chaotic , raucous live shows , the Los Angeles-based funk-punk band is touring to promote its latest CD , " One Hot Minute "  --  the first Chili Peppers album on which Navarro plays . <p> On record , the transition is almost seamless . The Chili Peppers continue exploring their signature sound . What 's missing are the extended jams that were a mainstay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place is hard funk meshed with solid rock . <p> The Peppers were to headline a sold-out show Saturday at the United Center , but the tour has been postponed . Drummer Chad Smith broke his wrist . The band decided to delay the tour while he recuperates . The Chicago show will be scheduled for a later date at the United Center ; all tickets will be honored , so fans should hold on to them . <p> Navarro had his work cut out for him when he became a Pepper , Co-founders Anthony Kiedis ( vocals ) and Flea ( bass ) had been friends and musical collaborators since the 10th grade . Both got mohawks at the same time , hitchhiked to San Francisco together and picked up a woman who turned out to be a man . Then there was their experimentation with drugs that would later lead to addictions . ( Both are clean now . ) <p> By the time Navarro joined the group two years ago , the band had a well-established funk rock sound that mainstream radio listeners knew , thanks to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " ( Under the Bridge " from their 1991 breakthrough album " Blood-SugarSexMagik . " By this time , the band was long past its cutting-edge phase and was immersed in stardom . All was well , except that the band 's guitarists kept quitting or getting fired . <p> Critics instantly speculated on how long Navarro would remain in the mercurial band . The succession of guitarists that played with the group in the past couple of years became a running joke that even the band members readily acknowledged . ( Drummer Smith told Rolling Stone . " We were like Spinal Tap , but it was the guitar player that kept exploding . " ) <p> " I did n't really pay attention to rumors about any revolving-door policy , " Navarro said . " I will not deny any other guitar player an opportunity to play in this band . " <p> After founding guitarist Hillel Slovak died of a heroin overdose in Lollapaooza tour that summer . At that time , the Peppers approached Navarro about becoming a member , but he declined , and formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In 1993 , the Peppers recruited Jesse Tobias ( Mother Tongue ) , but canned him a few weeks later because of personality differences . Around the same time , Navarro decided he would like to be a Pepper , too . When Navarro officially became one-fourth of the group , on Sept. 5 , 1993 , he did not own a Red Hot Chili Peppers album . <p> " I knew they were really talented musicians , and that was more important to me than knowing all their songs , " Navarro said . Laughing , he added . " I think they secretly hold it against me , though . " <p> At 28 , Navarro is n't just the newest member , but also the youngest . While he shares the band 's affinity for tatoos , he does n't understand their love for sports . <p> " I really ca n't stand sports , " he said . " I do n't relate to sports guys , either , which is another weird thing the case . These guys love basketball . The conversation always turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested . " <p> That 's not to say Navarro is n't in shape . In a band of workout fanatics , he might be in the best shape , thanks to gym visits five days a week . His conditioning is a good thing , considering that the Peppers are n't shy about exposing their forms onstage or in videos . This is the band that used to perform " Sir Psycho Sexy " wearing nothing but one sock each  --  and it wa n't on their feet . For the " Warped " video , Navarro said the director pretty much let them dress  --  or rather , undress  --  themselves . <p> " There were no wardrobe people , " Navarro said . " We came with what we had on and just did our own things . I 'm pretty open with sexuality . " <p> Having recently returned from a European tour . Navarro said he treasures his time off at home relaxing with his girlfriend , smoking cigaretts and sipping strong expressos . These days , nicotine and caffeine are his only vices . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigarettes at least are chemical-free . <p> " I do n't drink or do drugs and I am a ( vegetarian ) , " Navarro said . " When I joined the band , I wondered for a while whether it would be difficult to stay clean . But I knew that I was responsible for myself was an eye opener , but their friend River Phoenix 's overdose was the clincher . <p> Navarro refuses to make excuses for his addiction , but his childhood clearly was less than idyllic . When he was 15 , Navarro 's mother and aunt were murdered by a former boyfriend of his mom 's The Los Angeles native moved in with his father and immersed himself in two things : rock ' n ' roll and drugs . ( Shortly before Jane 's Addiction broke up in 1991 , Navarro had tried to commit suicide . ) <p> " I got through it all with the loving support of my friends and family , " Navarro said . " I 've learned that my own personal sanity takes precedence over anything , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the music business than I should be , but I do n't care enough to worry about anything . Ultimately , I know that I 'm going to show up and there will be a show and I 'll have a great time . If I flip out about the parameters of conducting that show , I 'll ruin and destroy anything from now until then . " <p> As to being the new guy in a band that formed 13 years ago . Navarro takes a laid-back approach . <p> " To be honest , the feeling of being the ' new guy ' comes and goes , " he said . " Sometimes I feel like the new guy , and sometimes I feel like the band is exactly the right thing for @x The timing could n't be better . Just as millions of working-age Americans are realizing they need extra education and skill-sharpening to thrive in a recession , a flowering of competition promises to dramatically drive down prices and raise the quality of online college courses . Indeed , time-stressed Americans fed up with commuting costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enrolled in at least one online course last fall , up from fewer than 2 million in 2003 . And some of the biggest online players , such as the for-profit University of Phoenix , say new enrollment has jumped by about 20 percent since the economy began its decline more than a year ago . While online courses have been primarily designed for working adults , younger students in increasing numbers are switching to E-learning . Some , like students at Fairleigh Dickinson University in New Jersey , have little choice . FDU requires its students to take at least one online course per year . The sector is booming even though online college courses have been dogged by complaints about poor quality and high prices . For example , the website of about-to-close Warren National University , which is not accredited by any federally approved agency , says it charged $9,000 for the coursework of a master 's degree . Unaccredited courses and degrees are generally not recognized by employers or other colleges . But demand for online courses might soon jump even more as expanding ranks of traditional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a few hundred dollars per course . ( Or , if you do n't care about getting credit , they 're absolutely free . ) Meanwhile , technological improvements , such as easier-to-use video cameras and software , are helping online schools make their courses more rigorous and more engaging . And some long-established online colleges may kick-start a race to raise quality by publishing indicators of their students ' satisfaction and progress at a new website that is expected to launch this spring . The competition and technological improvements add up to " a great thing " for anyone interested in learning , says Clayton Christensen , a Harvard Business School professor who studies the impact of technology on education . " What used to be expensive and inaccessible becomes convenient and accessible , " he says . " You can see price competition coming . " What 's more , the best online courses , in many cases , now rival the quality of traditional classes , says Christensen , who recently virtually audited a Brigham Young University online accounting course . " Anything beyond the 10th row @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he jokes . Lower prices . Although some of the big , established online players charge more than $1,500 a course , many of the newer entrants and public universities charge significantly less . In 2007 , Lamar University in Beaumont , Texas , started offering graduate education courses for just $412.50 apiece , which means a student could get a master 's for as little as $4,950 in 18 months . And several new Internet start-ups are promising even lower-cost courses , though they do not yet have the stamp of approval from government-approved accreditation agencies . The new nonprofit University of the People , which plans to start accepting students this spring , will offer totally free online courses and textbooks leading to business and computer technology bachelor 's degrees . The new university will charge students only up to $50 for admission and $100 for each final exam . ( Those in the developing world will pay less . ) The university will accept 300 students from around the world for its first semester this fall but hopes to expand quickly . The University of the People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairman of Cramster.com , is hopeful of eventual accreditation because he 's using volunteer professors from major universities . Another group of volunteer professors is putting the finishing touches on the free , online Peer 2 Peer University . Joel Thierstein , whose day job is as an associate provost of Rice University in Houston , says that by this summer , volunteers should be ready to present a few free online courses in subjects like economics , music theory , and writing . The website will also enable anyone to create any kind of free course for anyone else . These first courses , at least , will not be accredited . Many major universities , including Yale , MIT , and Stanford , have been allowing webizens to virtually audit lectures on their websites or via iTunes U. While there 's currently no way to take tests or earn credit , a for-profit website that started in January , Academic Earth , is gathering many of the free online college courses on one site to make it easier to peruse all the offerings . Eventually , 23-year-old founder Richard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ textbooks and podcasts and opportunities for interaction among students . Better quality . Of course , price is only part of the equation . Even free classes can waste precious time if the students do n't learn . There 's still plenty of skepticism about the quality of online classes . Indeed , some of online education 's biggest boosters say that most virtual classes are designed for working adults and may not be a good fit for , say , 18-year-old freshmen with poor self-discipline and time-management skills . Those students , they say , may need peer pressure and in-person reminders from professors to meet homework deadlines . Critics of online learning can be yet more damning . A recent survey of professors found that nearly half of those who had taught an online course felt that online students received an inferior education . Plenty of students also feel burned . Rosie Joseph , 20 , of Cincinnati dropped out of her University of Phoenix finance courses last year after two of her four instructors failed to respond promptly enough to her E-mails asking for explanations . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The clincher for her : She called up local employers to see if they would hire someone with an online degree , and at least one said , " We do n't encourage it , " Joseph says . But her fianc , 25-year-old Tim Scott , says he 's sticking with his online University of Phoenix information technology courses . He says his instructors have been responsive . And while he says the classes are sometimes boring and comparatively easy , he feels he is improving his writing and computer skills . Besides , he says , " this is pretty much the only way I could " get a college education , since he works nights as a clerk in a drugstore . Analysts say the market and technological forces that are driving down prices will cause some schools to improve services and quality . In fact , many online colleges are responding to complaints like Joseph 's . The University of Phoenix , the University of West Florida , and additional online schools require instructors to respond to student queries quickly , typically within 24 hours . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some online schools , such as Tiffin University 's Ivy Bridge online two-year college , go even further , hiring " coaches " or " advisers " who call or E-mail students regularly to encourage them and resolve complaints . And some schools are trying to ensure quality by limiting online courses to about 20 students each . To make their courses more convenient for working adult students , some schools are replacing job-unfriendly 13-week semesters with shorter , more intense courses . And some online universities , such as Capella , are trying to reduce frustration with online student collaboration by accepting only more mature students . Many colleges are also ratcheting up the rigor of online schoolwork . Online courses now typically require students to post gradable comments about each week 's assignment , which means that online students ca n't sit in the back of the class hoping the professor wo n't call on them . And several schools are cracking down on cheating . Some professors now require online students to collaborate on projects using software that shows who made what changes , so they 'll know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alabama requires online students who want to take their tests at home to install software that locks down their Web browsers and a spy camera so that remote observers can make sure they do n't cheat . Colleges are also trying to make online courses more engaging by moving beyond simple reading assignments and videotaped lectures . Jeannette E. Riley , named the best online teacher for 2008 by the Sloan Consortium , uses and assigns podcasts and videos in her online English and women 's studies classes at the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth . Good online courses require more work on the part of instructors and students , which can pay off in more learning , she says . " I love online teaching because no one can hide . Every voice is heard . " All of these new changes are drawing in students like Linda Summers , a 51-year-old corporate trainer in Canton , Ga. , who wanted to beef up her rsum and skills but did n't have the time to travel to a university campus . When she signed up for her first online graduate education course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the biggest mistake , " because that course required about 20 hours a week on top of her 40-hour-a-week work schedule . But now , in her second course , Summers is comfortable with the homework and has been pleasantly surprised by how much she enjoys the online conversations with the other adult students . " Online courses are perfect for me , " she says . E-learning on the Rise Some online colleges have been criticized for high prices and low quality . But as more colleges launch online courses , competition is reducing tuition and raising quality . That 's one reason online enrollment has been booming .
