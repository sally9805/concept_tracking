Her name was Margy , hard g , like aargh , or argonaut . Not soft g like margarine , and if someone called her that , she 'd show them her disdain . Sometimes her father did it for a laugh , and she 'd have to climb into his lap , press her nose to his , and stare at him until he stopped . She hated underpants , took them off the moment she left home . Stashed them in the bushes on the Common , skipped the last few blocks down Beacon Street , breezes playing freely underneath her pleated skirt . Some days she forgot and climbed the jungle gym , leaped off of it whooping , and suddenly her mother would arrive . <p> " You 'll be the death of me , " she 'd say , holding out another pair of underpants for Margy to step in  --  then she 'd yank them firmly up again . " Why ca n't you keep them on ? " <p> " They feel obnoxious , " Margy would explain , enduring them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them off again . <p> After school , her mother practiced organ in the cold stone church , while Margy climbed the slippery backs of pews . At home they would sing songs from musicals or off the radio , her mother leaning back and smiling while her fingers rode the keys of the old upright piano in the living room , The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain , and Suddenly those little eyes will flash and send you thrashing through the wall . But on the organ , it was Bach and Buxtehude , Handel and hymns , and her mother crouched over the tiered keyboards , one hand stretched to hold a chord while the other flipped a page , or changed the trumpets into piccolos , bare toes on the pedals as the pipes around them roared , shuddering the walls and floors . <p> Margy tried piano , but she was small for her age , skinny and pale , hair almost white and curled in tiny knots , glasses on her nose  --  her fingers did n't span five notes . Her mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Margy was not impressed . Violins droned in a swarm like bees , filling in the background of the melody . They whined like hamsters , put out snoring sounds that made her want to snooze . <p> Then her mother gave her one her size , with a bow . Three strokes on the strings , close up beneath her chin , and she had noticed certain possibilities . This thing could shriek like an ice pick in your ear , and it was portable . You could sneak around a corner , stampede into a room , drown out the piano if you stood on top of it . <p> " All right , all right , " her mother said and cowered back , as Margy stormed into the kitchen , showing her . <p> Her mother drove her to lessons and , on Saturdays , to music school . Weekdays she practiced in a classroom at lunchtime , while other kids milled uselessly around , pausing on the blacktop underneath the window where she played . Her mother would show up with violin and food , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with pimentos , peanut butter and bananas on raisin bread . Her mother grew up in Virginia , in a house where other women cooked , and she claimed she could n't boil water when she married Margy 's dad . But she took to cooking ardently and made up recipes , crab baked with mayonnaise in ceramic seashells , cheese sails on potato boats , apples stuffed with walnuts in marshmallow sauce . <p> Margy ate the crazy food , learned all the squeaks and wails the violin could make . She let herself be dressed in pinafores , driven off to play in little halls with brocade chairs , mothers in white gloves and hats with veils . Sometimes she played in church , echoes crashing onto stone , and once a year before a panel of old men , who scowled over their glasses if she played a piece in double time , or threw in extra fingering to make it sound more interesting . <p> " Just play the notes on the page , " her mother said grimly , driving her away from one audition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a " Poor " in Discipline . " Just the notes on the page . Ca n't you see them there ? " <p> She bought Margy a metronome , made her use it every time she played . She made her stand still practicing , nose-strings-elbow-knee all in one line , and not burst into rooms , leap out of closets fiddling . The year she turned eleven , her mother sent her to charm school , to set her straight on a few things . In an empty classroom after school , with a dozen other girls , she learned to hold a purse in the crook of her arm , clutch gloves by the fingers ( not the palm ) , cross legs at the ankle ( not the knee ) . She learned to say " I 'm sorry " and " Excuse me " and " That was n't what I meant to say , " and " I 'm afraid that did n't come out quite right . " She learned to gain ten pounds . One week they had to take their measurements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each desk , whispering advice . Sixty-eight pounds was not enough , she said . Twenty-six inches was n't much of a chest . She sent Margy home to drink a glass of half-and-half with ginger ale every afternoon , sitting at the table with her mother watching her . Then she would race upstairs , remove her boring uniform , pick up the violin . Their house was solid brick , attached on both sides , with centuries of dust in cracks along the floors  --  her father was an architect , restored it himself , and he thought it had once been a barracks in the Revolutionary War . But standing on a chair at the head of the stairs , she could shudder it from attic to basement with shock waves of violin . <p> " What hath God wrought ? " her father said one day , gazing up the stairs at her as he came in , though he had been raised by devout New England atheists and did not go to church at all . <p> One day after school , her mother was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out for hamburgers . Just a little operation , he said , she 'd be all right in a few weeks . Weeks ? Margy thought , and eyed the empty house . She took the violin into the hospital , but the nurses said her mother was n't ready yet to hear her play . Her mother lay as flat as if her bones were gone , bandages from neck to knee , smelling of alcohol . Her face was white and thin , her eyes slid off of Margy 's when they tried to look at her . Margy gripped her shoulder once to stress a point ( Come home at once ) , and her mother 's mouth opened , pink with a black hole in back , let out a high thin note . A nurse rushed in , took Margy out . <p> Her grandmother came from Virginia , cooked for them , closed the door to Margy 's room when she was practicing . Her mother came home for a week , thin and strangely brown , soft hair vanished underneath a wig of gleaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used in bows . Then she was gone again . One day her grandmother came to school , took Margy out . <p> She would always have her mother now , her grandmother said . She would always be there , looking out for her . Only somewhat invisible , because God had wanted her too much . <p> " God , " Margy said , for approximately the last time in her life . <p> At the funeral , the organ was silent , like a riderless horse . Her father towered next to her , no part of him moving , eyes open on the prayers . Her grandmother draped both her heavy arms around Margy 's shoulders , exuding softness and lavender , easing her head down toward the floor . Margy studied the flagstones , listened to the shuffling and sniffling , the rumbling in her grandmother 's throat , forever and ever , father , son , and ghost . <p> Her grandmother stayed on a few more weeks , taught her to dust and clean , scrub vegetables , cook bacon , wash her father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on her own . After school , when her father was gone , she 'd practice violin , go through his desk , eat sugar cubes . For dinner she cooked things she knew : spaghetti with tomato sauce , grilled-cheese sandwiches , canned peas . Once , she put her hand down on the stove and burned it black , smelled it searing like a steak . White ridges of the fingerprints rose past the char , a blueprint or road map . <p> " Electric burners can be dangerous , " her father said , examining the bandage she had made . He was fond of practical details , built his own models , and sometimes Margy helped , gluing tiny trees of crepe paper to paper grass , around the cardboard buildings he designed . He taught her to clean counters ( feeling with the fingers , not the sponge ) , compare the different brands of food ( weight as well as price ) . When she ironed his pants with creases to the sides , he showed her the right way . It was his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin , though he was tall , his tight curls faintly red . Now he focused on her hand . <p> " It 's going to hurt for days , " he said . <p> " It 's all right , " Margy said , took back her hand , though it was throbbing to the elbow at the time . She could n't play the violin for weeks . But then she could , and she carried it to school in its case , to practice at lunch hour with no one listening . <p> The spring she was fourteen , the Common filled with hippies , in dirty feet and jewels in their noses and even naked flopping breasts , whirling on the grass and staring at the sun , or even writhing underneath some smelly hippie guy  --  Margy would avert her eyes , passing in her blue-check uniform . She wore underpants these days , and knew certain things for sure : she had good taste . She was not cheap . Boys would have to crawl through flames to get to her . And if a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Common ( rolling skirts up to the crotch , penciling their eyes with kohl , smoking marijuana in the ladies ' room ) , Margy avoided them . She practiced violin , in perfect time without a metronome , every sinew tuned to play vibrato , tremolo , vicious fingering by Mozart , Paganini , Brahms . <p> Then one day a girl that she had known since they were five , who sometimes wore her Girl Scout uniform to school , wrote her a note to say that she was having sex . Karen was a round , contented blonde , like several others to whom Margy had attached herself  --  " Margy 's Brunhildes , " her mother had called them , because none of them had learned to walk till they were three , and they spent their afternoons in ruffled bedrooms , eating cupcakes , making up for Margy 's meager twitchiness with gorgeous amplitude . Margy and Karen wrote notes in Math when they were bored , usually about the unclean uniform on the girl in front of them , or people that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flute . Today Mary had to read the note three times , the room around her spangled in strange light . At the board , the math teacher droned on about Pythagoras and pi . <p> " What was it like ? " she scrawled , fingers trembling . " Painful ? " she added , folded the note up , and waited for Mr. Bobbio to turn around . From the side of her eye , she could see Karen at the desk across the aisle , watching the board with round blue eyes , pageboy smooth against her cheek like a little Dutch girl in a tulip field . <p> " Only at first , " the note came back . " Then it was nice . You wo n't believe how good it felt by the second or third time . " <p> Margy slid down in her seat , trying not to breathe unusually . Her mother had of course described the procreative act to her , but so gruesomely she had assumed that it must happen in a doctor 's office , under medical supervision , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the logic of the thing had worried her . She knew her mother had had five miscarriages before she was born , and that her parents had decided to stop trying to have kids , when Margy " came along . " <p> " The birth control we had in those days was n't very good , " her mother had explained , avoiding her eyes . " So you happened in spite of it . " <p> " Why did n't you just not do it ? " Margy had suggested firmly , having put up with all the foolishness she could . <p> Her mother seemed to freeze on this question . <p> " It 's an expression of love , " she said , but so stiffly Margy knew something was wrong with this . She had n't given it much thought in the intervening time . But now here was Karen 's note , saying , " It makes me go all gooey like a toasted marshmallow , just to remember it . " <p> Mr. Bobbio was drifting near her desk , his hair half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , black eyes shining ecstatically . Sometimes he forgot about Pythagoras and told them about World War II , in which he had flown planes . Margy stared up at him , willing him to take a trip to the Calvados zone . <p> " You always know where you are with geometry , " he said , gazing down at her . Lightly he rapped his knuckles on her desk , inches from the note . " No flailing in the dark . The numbers are either there , or they 're not . " <p> Margy 's lips parted , she gave him a small understanding smile  --  for a moment he stared back as if entranced . Face clearing , he whirled back to the board . <p> " How big does it get ? " she wrote . " How often does it happen ? How long does it take ? " <p> They never wrote about it anywhere but Math . Other teachers were too alert , known to read the notes that fell into their hands , and though they gave each other significant looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned it out loud . But that spring Margy learned a great deal in Geometry . Familiar words revealed themselves in a new and startling light : to come , to pull out , to o down . When the man comes , when the woman comes . When come has a " the " in front of it . She also learned new words she 'd never heard , short and punchy , or with luscious rolling sounds . She was not used to learning things from Karen . Margy got better grades , and Karen sometimes had to copy from her tests . Margy won all of their fights . A few years before , they 'd had a screaming argument , about the number of secret openings in the female body . They had just seen the film about those special times they could look forward to having soon , and Karen thought the movie had implied a third , between the two they knew . Out on the asphalt after school , she drew a diagram in hopscotch chalk , three holes in a vertical line . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two , and applied some crushing logic : How could there be room ? Why did you need it , for such a minor event ? Faces hot , both shrieked at once  --  till Karen began to falter . Blinking , bewildered , she 'd accepted defeat . <p> " It better not come out as fast as I usually pee , " she said , looking worried for the first time . <p> Now Margy asked the questions , Karen answered them . ( Big as a cardboard toilet paper roll . Half an hour , maybe less . Any time we like . ) At the end of every class , Karen grandly handed her the notes , and Margy locked them up inside the blue velvet pocket of her violin case , to study later on . The trees on Beacon Street lushed out in pale green leaf , the air warm and sweet with whiffs of river rot just lately thawed from ice , as they joined the flood of girls after school in blue plaid uniforms . Karen rode with her car pool , back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the boys ' school across town , bringing foam or rubbers or his mother 's diaphragm , whatever he had managed to secure . Karen 's mother ate late lunches out and liked to shop , have her hair combed out , and drink tea with friends . Karen 's father did not live with them , and Mrs. Snyder went out frequently at night , sometimes in strapless gowns , smelling of hand-mixed powder by Charles of the Ritz and perfume . Once she had come into Margy 's house to use the phone , and for three days afterwards it smelled like Joy de Jean Patou . Karen was always in her bed alone , asleep , when her mother came back home . <p> Margy practiced violin , made dinner for her father and herself . Three nights a week she had rehearsal with Youth Orchestra , next door to the Boston Symphony , and Karen showed up , too , a little late most nights , with fresh red cheeks , body languid as a smile , lips too bruised to form an embouchure . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little halls of brocade chairs , boys from Catholic School who smoked out on the fire escape and made rude noises on their instruments . The soloist on this year 's Mozart was the older brother of a kid they knew from music school . Jason Slade was shorter than Margy , shaped like a brick , and snide  --  Margy had known him since they were six , and never seen him smile . But his older brother , Gary , was tall and handsome , graceful as a tulip from the bulb of Jason Slade , and he knew how to smile . He went to Latin School , played piano instead of violin , and in the fall he would be going to Juilliard . These days at music school , Margy played piano for her second instrument , but she knew she sounded literal and childish next to him . As the concert date got close , she watched him almost every night , long hands floating across the keys , long back dipping gently to the beat , as if nodding in the breeze . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her way as she approached the Coke machine . Irish boys from Catholic School , their leader long and lean in painfully tight jeans , red hair slicked high into a point over his forehead like a cresting wave , though most young men these days wore theirs like Bobby Kennedy , or Gary Slade , clean and loose , washed every day . Jackson was the redhead 's name , and he leered down at Margy with his thin pink face , so close that she could catch the fake-mint odor on his hair . <p> " The Princess Margaret , " he said , while his henchmen lounged beside him , watching her . " Ice queen of the strings . " <p> Margy pulled her nose back from the smell . " What is that on your hair , Brylcreem ? " <p> The three boys chuckled to themselves . Jackson spread his hands . <p> " Ladies and gentlemen , I owe it all to Brylcreem . Gives me just the right amount of slip in those tight moments . " <p> The henchmen snickered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket of his jeans to wheedle out a long wide comb . Fascinated , Margy watched . <p> " You had a comb in there ? " she said , as Jackson extracted it , smoothed back his insulted hair . One of the henchmen leaned toward her . He was short and dark , trying to grow a mustache , lonely black hairs here and there on his upper lip . <p> " Yeah , and he 's got something else in there for you besides . " <p> Margy recoiled , turned back the way she came , and bounced into the soft Shetland sweater on the chest of Gary Slade . <p> " Shut up , McCarthy , " said a deep voice above her head . Long hands enclosed her shoulders , turned her away . Gary Slade led her to a spot on the black metal stairs , above the crowd in the hallway . He brought her a Coke , apologized for Jackson and McCarthy . <p> " Brass players . An unfortunate necessity , but hormonal cretins all the same . Try to ignore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the end of break , hands resting between his knees , asking polite questions about her school , her music teacher , who she knew , and on the next few nights , he brought her other Cokes , waited out front until her father came to pick her up . One night her father was late , and Gary took her hand , touched the calluses along the fingerpads . <p> " I see you 've been practicing like a good girl , " he said and laughed , lightly kissed them one by one . <p> Margy was too happy to speak , too happy to discuss it with anyone . She especially did n't mention it to Karen , who might have turned it into toilet paper rolls , and how to tell when it was time to make the man pull out . She was happy in the morning , opening her eyes , the yellow light in her bedroom , the promise of rehearsal later on . Even the dust motes in the air were beautiful , the smell of mothballs from the house on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hippies frolicking across the Common seemed innocuous and innocent , and when they asked her for change , she gave them what she had . <p> " Isosceles , " she said and beamed at Mr. Bobbio , the day she noticed the beauty of the triangle . So simple , so clear  --  no flailing in the dark ! The numbers always came out evenly ! <p> " Yes ! " he cried , his half-gray mane electrified . " Yes , you see ! You get it now ! " <p> The night before the final test in Math , Margy stayed up half the night to learn a month 's worth from the book , and by the next afternoon , she had forgotten most of it , though Karen faithfully copied what she wrote . That week her father had to take a trip , and he arranged for her to stay at Karen 's house . It was the last week of rehearsal with Youth Orchestra , the concert coming up on Friday night , and he promised to be back in time for it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Karen after school . Karen 's house was in Jamaica Plain , a wide brick split-level with big French doors that radiated cold for six months of the year , and every room was done in powder blue , with plush rugs , quilted wallpaper , satin-striped loveseats . Karen 's boyfriend did not appear that afternoon , with Margy there , and Karen seemed bored , showing off her stash of birth control , soaking in bubble bath until rehearsal time . <p> She had told her mother they 'd be riding to rehearsal with the parents of another girl , but since Mrs. Snyder was not home , her boyfriend picked them up a whole hour before rehearsal time . They dropped Margy at the empty hall , and by the time Karen got back the orchestra had filled the chairs , milled through warm-up , settled down , and was torturing the opening of the Beethoven . The conductor glared across the stage , but Karen did not glance his way , sliding into place with the flutes . <p> Gary asked if he could drive Margy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told her , Karen widened her round eyes , looked slightly scandalized , and disappeared . <p> " Karen Snyder is a nice girl , " Gary said , as they drove away in his parents ' car . " But possibly a little bit naive . And not as talented as you . " <p> He drove out past Jamaica Plain along a wooded road , and parked the car in the dark . Up close he smelled like English Leather , clean skin and ironed shirt . Margy was aware of his heartbeat , the prickle at the edge of his smooth lips , the warmth inside his mouth  --  while at the same time she was leaping off of cliffs , discovering that she could fly . She was playing on a stage in Yankee Stadium , fifty thousand people throwing roses and star lilies , Leonard Bernstein on his knees . <p> Gradually a chill crept in the car . When she opened her eyes , the darkness seemed less dense , more clear , though Gary had removed her glasses long before . She sat up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get back . Mrs. Snyder will think I 've been kidnapped . " <p> He kept his arms around her , face down in her neck . " Maybe you have been . Girl violinist kidnapped in Jamaica Plain . Symphony joins girl hunt , beating with bows . " <p> Margy chuckled , rested her forehead a moment on his shirt . It was time to go  --  she pulled a little farther back . <p> In the dim light from the road , Gary watched her , arching one sandy brow . His free hand reached toward the steering wheel . Slipping the car keys from the ignition , he tucked them in one graceful movement down inside his fine-wale tan cords . <p> " Whoops . Did you see that ? " <p> Margy chuckled , watching him . He looked at her pleasantly . <p> " Well , we have a problem here . We ca n't go anyplace till somebody gets the keys . You saw where they went , did n't you ? I 'm afraid you 'll have to put your hand in there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure , " Margy said and laughed . <p> " You may laugh , you may joke , ha ha , " Gary said . " But the fact remains , we wo n't leave here until you get the keys . " <p> Obscurely she imagined the inside of his pants  --  nothing Karen said helped now , and she could only picture it as something like her own , cold skin that never saw the light , little secret hairs , parts that needed scrupulous washing . His parents ' car was big and wide , and the seat back popped with static sparks as she slid closer to the door . <p> " Gary . We have to go . " <p> " Sure , " he said , sliding after her . " We 'll go . But first you have a job to do . Here , I 'll make it easy for you . " <p> Reaching down with both hands , he undid the top button of his pants . Breathing on her neck , he shifted on the seat , lifting his crotch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold and loose as Margy fumbled for it in the dark  --  jerking it , she burst out of the car . The sudden motion of the night was a surprise , a breeze swinging wires , black leaves nodding against splashes of light . Loafers slapping on asphalt , she ran down a hill , out of sight of the fat car . She 'd left her glasses on the dash , and objects farther than a few feet off were blurred into one plane . But across the road , she could remember woods , with Boston on the other side . Dashing across , she climbed the bank , slipping to her knees in the wet grass . <p> Streetlight faintly lit the trees , as branches zigzagged toward her face , senseless as a drawing by Picasso or Braque . Then it was dark in a way the Back Bay never was , and she had to hold her hands before her eyes to ward off twigs . She knew about woods mainly by rumor . Her mother had never let her go to camp , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spangled branch above her head while she did petits pas across the stage . That time she had not been alone , and where to go was chalked along the floor . The music told her when to move . This time there was no sound but her own breath , and the secret shush of leaves . <p> The wide brick houses had a military look , like bunkers guarding missiles in the dark , and none of them were lit . Her loafers were fine as glove leather , had cost her half a year 's allowance , but they hung heavy now with mud . Shuffling up and down the blocks , she peered without her glasses in the dark , until she found the house she thought was right , though the front door was locked . The back gate groaned , and she clattered into a chaise lounge . Holding her breath , she crept up to the French doors in back , and lights burst on inside . <p> Mrs. Snyder stood behind the glass , eyes unnaturally wide . She had on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satin cap , and she was hiding something behind her back . Perfume rolled out the doors as she opened them , made little jerking motions with her head , told Margy to get in . Did she realize that it was four a.m. ? Did she realize this was a gun in her hand ? <p> " I do n't want to scare you , " she said . " But this is a gun in my hand . " <p> Mrs. Snyder let her sleep a few hours on a loveseat , so as not to wake Karen . Then she took her home before Karen could wake up . Driving in the station wagon through the bright May dawn , she said it was too bad , but she felt sure that Margy understood . Mrs. Snyder was already groomed , in a pink sweater set , pearls , and powder , shellpink lipstick applied with a brush . In the morning light , her hair was fair as Karen 's , all one shade , like the wig that Margy 's mother had once used . Margy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's because you lost your mother , " Mrs. Snyder said . <p> " Girls have gone wild before because of that . I feel for you , I really do . But I have my own girl to protect . You understand . " <p> She could not let Karen go on being friends with her . Karen 's grades were suffering , and the math teacher had even called to say she 'd cheated on a test , and Margy was involved . <p> " Now this . It 's just too much . " She had called Margy 's father at his hotel in New York . He was cutting short the trip , would be home by dinnertime . She drove into the streets of the Back Bay , stopped in front of Mary 's house . Tipping her head to one side , she gave Mary a small smile . <p> " You could set that hair of yours , you know . Tame that curl down . You 're not a bad-looking girl . You could be all right . " <p> Margy wore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a turtleneck , though it failed to cover up the purple bruises on her neck . On the left , where the violin pressed to her skin , they might have passed for signs of vigorous practicing . But they were on the right , bloomed in plain sight like horrible mushrooms , blue with red veins and painful to the touch , though she had n't felt him giving them to her . Every eye that passed over her face slid down an inch and paused . The conductor 's eyes surveyed the violins , and lingered on her neck . The boy on her right , who smelled like old cheese , shot so many sweaty looks her way that he lost his place , came in two measures early on the Beethoven . <p> Gary strolled to the piano for his solo and returned to his place in back without a glance her way . Karen did not stop to say hello , or sit with her in Math . She wore her Girl Scout uniform to school , and was on time for orchestra . Rehearsal breaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Coke machine , and Karen stayed in her seat , turned her pageboy under with her hands as she talked to the girl next to her . Once , Margy came back to the room and saw Gary crouched by Karen 's side . A moment later , Karen threaded through the chairs , slipped the missing glasses into Margy 's lap , and turned away . <p> " Here , " she whispered , not even looking at her face , as if the glasses were a knife with blood on it , or soiled underpants . <p> Concert night , Gary and Jason Slade were giving a party after the show . They lived in Brookline , had a pool , and everyone seemed to be going except Margy . In the locker room , a cellist Margy knew showed her the red bikini underneath her concert clothes . <p> " This damn thing , " she said , wriggling to pull it down in back . " Makes lousy underwear . But nothing 's going to stop me getting in that pool . " <p> Margy had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the audience , and in her required white-blouse-black-skirt , the marks on her neck must have been discernible up to the second balcony . Past the lights , she heard the breathing of five hundred parents , grandparents , uncles , cousins , aunts , every time she lifted up her bow . But ten minutes after their cheerful dumb encore ( the same scherzo they had done the year before ) , the building drained of life , except for Margy and the cheese-smelling boy , plus twenty or so desperate nerds who cried if you looked at them , standing in the lobby with their parents drinking punch . Margy was stunned with misery . Her father had been kind to her all week , not mentioning her neck , or Mrs. Snyder , or four a.m. , and tonight he had dressed up in a Windsor jacket worthy of Sherlock Holmes , belted in orangish-brown plaid that clashed with his hair , matching pants , and freshly polished brown wingtips . Raising his eyebrows , he offered various remarks . <p> " Great concert . Glad it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Not really , " Margy managed to say . " Can we please go ? " <p> Her father seemed deflated . " Then who are your friends ? " <p> She went backstage to get her clothes . In the echoing wings , a girl laughed somewhere , and a door slammed . Then it was so quiet she could hear the metal of the stair rail tick as she climbed to the locker rooms . She was almost to the top when Jackson and McCarthy burst out through the swinging doors , laughing so their eyes were slits . <p> " Well , I do declare , " Jackson said . Smelling flammable , they stood at the head of the stairs . <p> " Well , well , " said McCarthy , and tried to hang a cigarette from his lower lip  --  falling , it glanced off his chest and down the stairs . With a flourish , Jackson slid one out of his own pack , lit it , placed it tenderly in his friend 's lips . Margy tried to slip past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , one arm shooting out to block her path . From his pocket , he extracted a glass flask . " Here 's to your neck . " <p> " Your neck ? " McCarthy cried , exhaling an enthusiastic cloud . <p> Jackson wiped the top of the flask with his sleeve , and held it out . " You are a much nicer girl than we thought . Such a goddamn lot of virgins in this orchestra . " <p> McCarthy nodded vigorously . " Like that ice bitch , Karen Snyder , your frigid friend . Hers is made of leather , I understand . Thanks be to the Heavenly Father , Margy Rose , and let us sing to you , for not being one of them . " <p> Mary felt a sudden rushing in her veins , like a train toward <p> brick wall . She took the flask from Jackson 's hand . The first sip hurt , then it felt good . <p> " Okay , " she said , a twisted croak . She cleared her throat . " Okay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McCarthy , for your poontang ? How do you boys like it , anyway ? Face to face , or maybe in the rear , the Catholic way ? Let 's get those jeans off now , and see what you can do . Let 's see those dangerous dicks . Big and hard , are they , or suitable to satisfy a toy poodle ? " <p> McCarthy and Jackson seemed to have lost the ability to move . In the fluorescent light of the stairwell , every hair and pimple glared against the pallor of their skin . <p> " You know , " she said . " Cunt teasing is just as bad as the other kind . Worse , actually , when you have n't got the balls to turn blue . Have you boys worn out your weenies jerking off today , or are you ready to screw ? " <p> " You 'd better watch ... " Jackson began faintly , his voice trailing off . Taking the bottle from her hand , he glanced around to see if anyone was listening , stepped down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What I really want to know is , do you boys have foreskins ? In my survey of American males , it seems to me that circumcision has become awfully popular lately , and I 'd like to see one of those floppy little hoods if I ever get the chance . Do they do it to little Catholics ? Put the knife right on that tender tip and slice it off of you ? " <p> Jackson and McCarthy turned , shoulders lightly touching . At the bottom of the stairs , they pushed out through the exit door , a gust of giggles blowing back as i swung closed . Margy rushed behind them , as far as the fire escape , trying to make use of her full vocabulary . She hit on some happy phrases by the end , but Jackson and McCarthy were gone , and her last remarks were wasted on brick walls , plus a pair of parents walking up the alleyway , a boy with a French horn between them as if on a leash . The woman 's hair was short and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her perfume , something sugary and green , not Joy de Jean Patou . <p> The woman stared up at her , eyes glowing in the dark : You 'll be the death of someone , they said . Does your mother know where you are ? <p> I do n't have a mother , Margy thought , with a sudden leap of heart . No mother she could hurt with what she did , or appall , or please . Somehow for two years she 'd gone on expecting her , as if she were about to show up with a pair of underpants . But her mother was n't on her way , and Margy could go naked underneath her clothes , play double time or with the metronome . Become a Girl Scout in a diaphragm , or only sound like one . Or she could try to play at Yankee Stadium . <p> The little family retreated to the street , turned the corner out of sight . Margy tried the door of the fire escape . But it was locked from the inside , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air , proceed by the front doors into the bright lights of the lobby , where her father was waiting . <p>
