<p> DID you know that film-star Gary Cooper wore size 14 shoes ? Bi-ig ! There 's a photo ( in a book I have called " The Book of Lists " ) of his shoe prints at Grauman 's Chinese Theater in Hollywood . I think they must be set in concrete . That 's fame - giant footprints fixed forever . <p> Have you noticed how dogs and cats , just like Gary Cooper , have a fatal attraction for putting their feet in wet concrete ? Make a new concrete floor in the basement , and what happens ? <p> The cat , thinking it 's solid ground , meanders gingerly across it in the middle of the night on the lookout for local mice , and in the morning you come down to find a perfect , delicately placed track of pawprints , like a string of blackberries , marking in the now hard-set concrete a beautiful cat route . Little does that cat know the evidence he has left so permanently behind him . <p> I always imagine , when something like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time some archaeologist will dig down through the earth and discover irrefutable evidence of our basement and valuable knowledge of the eccentric behavior , after dark , of our cat . After all , that 's what they 've done with dinosaurs . <p> DO you realize that in Texas , in Connecticut , in Arizona , and other places , fossils of dinosaurs ' footprints left in the mud in the Mesozoic period are known ? And from such fossils the experts believe they know how dinosaurs stood , walked , ran , and jumped . They reckon that some of these extinct creatures could travel 25 miles per hour . But they have also decided , from fossilized tracks of footprints with short gaps between , that many of them did quite a lot of slow ambling ... <p> Of course , one of the most famous modern and human footprintmakers ever was the ambling man who said , " That 's one small step for man , one giant leap for mankind . " But Neil Armstrong , planting the first footprints of any man ever on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was no gigantic creature : He was only wearing size 9-1/2 boots . Rather small , do n't you think , for the first man on the moon ? ( Maybe they should have sent Gary Cooper . ) <p> On the other hand , size is n't everything . That film star 's shoe prints are notable for something else which is rather dull : They are completely plain - there is n't a pattern on them . Flat as pancakes . I think it would be different today . The bottoms of shoes - soles and heels - have now become regular works of three-dimensional art , a place where designers can let their imaginations go . Places to carve and mold . There hardly seem to be two shoe bottoms alike . <p> I ca n't say I often get down on the ground and investigate the underside of people 's shoes and boots , so it 's only when exactly the right kind of snow falls in exactly the right kind of way that the opportunity to make a detailed study occurs . <p> That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other day . This snow was not too soft and not too frozen hard . It was like good cookie mixture . Tread on it , with a satisfying " crump ! " and you leave a crisp footprint with all the furrows and ridges precisely in place . <p> I walked the dog quite early that morning , but the path already showed evidence of two or three other people who 'd gone that way . Without the snow , I might have thought I was the first . <p> At lunch time we were out again , and my own earlier prints ( these particular boots leave prints that are a crisscross network combined with wiggly waves ) were still as good as ever but now they were joined by hundreds of others . There were shoe prints everywhere , like shoals of fish . <p> While the dog sniffed for smelly memories and hints of dogs and cats , I looked with increasing fascination at all that inventiveness and patternmaking that normally lies hidden underfoot . <p> Here were shoe prints that looked like the layout of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zigzags , suggesting old family connections of aristocratic bearing . Shoe prints that were just a host of dots or studs , suggesting athletic prowess . Others like diagrams of radio waves . Sherlock Holmes could have had a ball ! <p> Someone with American sneakers - if the stars and stripes were anything to go by - had walked in the other direction from me . One strange passage of prints had been made by boots that did n't seem to have toes and heels at all , but were like fat sausages . I could n't guess which way their owner had been walking ... or hopping ? <p> Some of the marks had the names of the manufacturer - but of course inside out ! It was only later that I found my shoes ( rather than my boots ) also had the maker 's name in relief between toe and heel . I danced about trying to imprint it perfectly in the garden . This manufacturer was clever . Maybe he had even thought about snowprints . The name there is " Ecco , " and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everywhere I walked I left an advertisement . Later still - next day - I found someone else in the neighborhood also had " Ecco " shoes ! I wonder who ? <p> Of course all these shoe prints washed away when the thaw came , and since then , while walking the dog , it has been a lot less interesting looking at the ground . But it strikes me that someone could make interesting pictures out of shoe prints . Printing is a great way of making pictures : You can do it by cutting or gouging linoleum , or wood , or by engraving or etching flat metal plates . Lots of ways . These surfaces are then " inked " - you can do it with a special roller , very carefully and smoothly rolled in ink on a sheet of glass , this way and that . Then you lay a sheet of paper on top of your " plate " and rub the back of the paper all over with a small spoon ... and then , presto ! the magic moment : You very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface is your picture . Some people have made prints by cutting and inking halved potatoes . But I do n't know of anyone ( I 'm sure there must be someone ) who makes pictures with footprints . <p> SO I 've tried it . You roll the ink on the raised parts of the heel and sole , put the paper flat on the floor , put your foot in the boot or shoe , and carefully place it - pressing down firmly - on the paper . Then lift off . ( Before you go walking away in that shoe again , and if you want your mother to go on loving you , it 's best to clean off the remaining ink . Or better yet , have her help you ! ) <p> I was quite pleased with my first results , just using black ink . Like Gary Cooper , I felt I 'd announced for all the world to see , " I was here ! " <p> I 'm not sure my shoe prints will last quite as long as dinosaurs ' . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> ' Kidspace ' is a place on The Home Forum pages where kids can find stories that will tickle imaginations , entertain with a tall tale , explain how things work , or describe a real-life event .
