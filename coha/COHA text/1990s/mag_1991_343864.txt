Environmental sensitivity is now as required an attitude in polite society as is , say , belief in democracy or aversion to polyester . But now that everyone from Ted Turner to George Bush , Dow to Exxon has professed love for Mother Earth , how are we to choose among the dozens of conflicting proposals , restrictions , projects , regulations and laws advanced in the name of the environment ? Clearly not everything with an environmental claim is worth doing . How to choose ? <P> There is a simple way . First , distinguish between environmental luxuries and environmental necessities . Luxuries are those things it would be nice to have if costless . Necessities are those things we must have regardless . Then apply a rule . Call it the fundamental axiom of sane environmentalism : Combatting ecological change that directly threatens the health and safety of people is an environmental necessity . All else is luxury . <P> For example : preserving the atmosphere  --  stopping ozone depletion and the greenhouse effect  --  is an environmental necessity . In April scientists reported that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depletion not only causes skin cancer and eye cataracts , it also destroys plankton , the beginning of the food chain atop which we humans sit . <P> The reality of the greenhouse effect is more speculative , though its possible consequences are far deadlier : melting ice caps , flooded coastlines , disrupted climate , parched plains and , ultimately , empty breadbaskets . The American Midwest feeds the world . Are we prepared to see Iowa acquire Albuquerque 's climate ? And Siberia acquire Iowa 's ? <P> Ozone depletion and the greenhouse effect are human disasters . They happen to occur in the environment . But they are urgent because they directly threaten man . A sane environmentalism , the only kind of environmentalism that will win universal public support , begins by unashamedly declaring that nature is here to serve man . A sane environmentalism is entirely anthropocentric : it enjoins man to preserve nature , but on the grounds of self-preservation . <P> A sane environmentalism does not sentimentalize the earth . It does not ask people to sacrifice in the name of other creatures . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sacrifice in the name of other humans . ( Think of the chronic public resistance to foreign aid and welfare . ) Ask hardworking voters to sacrifice in the name of the snail darter , and , if they are feeling polite , $ they will give you a shrug . <P> Of course , this anthropocentrism runs against the grain of a contemporary environmentalism that indulges in earth worship to the point of idolatry . One scientific theory  --  Gaia theory  --  actually claims that Earth is a living organism . This kind of environmentalism likes to consider itself spiritual . It is nothing more than sentimental . It takes , for example , a highly selective view of the benignity of nature . My nature worship stops with the April twister that came through Andover , Kans. , or the May cyclone that killed more than 125,000 Bengalis and left 10 million ( ! ) homeless .
