With cinematic flourish , Dino De Laurentiis would jump up from his plate of spaghetti at the boardroom table , wave his cook aside and bolt into the company 's kitchen . Nobody , he told his guests , could make cappuccino like the maestro himself ! As he spoke , Hollywood 's flashiest independent producer would secretly hit the " start " button on an ordinary cappuccino machine . He would then present his charmed visitors with cupfuls of " Dino 's special cappuccino  --  the best ! " <P> That was a vintage De Laurentiis performance from the mid-1980s , when bankers and investors were enthralled with the gruff-talking miniature ( 5-ft. 4-in. ) movie mogul . De Laurentiis proceeded to lose nearly $200 million of their money in a grandiose and allegedly fraudulent attempt to build an entertainment empire . By 1988 , after producing two dozen money-losing pictures in two years , De Laurentiis Entertainment Group filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy . <P> Yet De Laurentiis ' ability to dazzle and deal is scarcely diminished . In February the 70-year-old legend rose from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dino De Laurentiis Communications , with the financial backing of his friend Giancarlo Parretti , the controversial Italian moneyman who also plans to buy MGM/UA for $1.2 billion . Dino 's planned renaissance will begin with five films and a $67 million budget . <P> De Laurentiis now faces enough doubters to populate a biblical epic . Most of the independent film companies that a bullish Wall Street took public in the mid-1980s  --  Cannon , Vestron , New World , Kings Road  --  have either passed into bankruptcy or deep financial trouble . But none have burned through as much money in so short a time  --  without even a near hit  --  as De Laurentiis . Worse still , few if any ventures contained such a web of insider-enriching transactions . Stockholders of DEG , who saw their shares plummet from a peak of $19 to less than 40 cents , have responded with fiery class-action lawsuits . At the same time , DEG is suing De Laurentiis for $50 million , accusing its founder of fraud , misrepresentation and self-dealing . <P> In a 500-film career that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a handful of successes that include the Fellini-directed La Strada ( 1954 ) , Serpico ( 1974 ) , King Kong ( 1976 ) and Conan the Barbarian ( 1982 ) . But the hits have been overshadowed by hundreds of commercial duds , most notably the $50 million sci-fi film Dune , a 1984 mega-flop that helped send Dino down the chute . <P> When he pitched DEG to investors , De Laurentiis promised he would make careful , modestly budgeted pictures . Yet once ensconced at DEG , he refused to share decision-making authority and showed a knack for picking up screenplays that other studios had wisely spurned . For an Old World producer accustomed to making budget-busting epics , the studio 's ambitious production slate of twelve to 20 films a year was a script for disaster . One project , the 1986 film Tai- Pan , cost $25 million to make but brought in barely $2 million . <P> The aging filmmaker ran DEG like a private fiefdom , showering his family members and girlfriend with six-figure salaries or distribution deals . " So much money passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all went , " says Gary DeVore , DEG 's former head of production . " I was one of the highest- placed executives and I did n't even know about the deals with Dino 's family . "
