Julia Tutwiler Prison for Women in Wetumpka , Alabama , opened its doors 52 years ago . They have been closed ever since . There are more than 700 women in Tutwiler . I see them walking the yard barely acknowledging the outside world , as if looking at the passing cars would pain them . The warden told me that this is the best place some of the women have ever lived . They have food , a bed , a family , education , and no man to beat them . Some who have killed abusive husbands have finally found safety behind the huge doors . The barred doors are 20 feet high and very heavy . When they are slammed shut , the sound cuts through your bones . The buzzers that are pushed to allow the doors to open sound like a swarm . Constant footsteps walking in single-file lines . Rhythmic . All singing , beating out the same songs : Do n't make me move . Fans are droning . Radios are on with no one listening . Women are yelling back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fill the time . The women never scared me . It is the sound of locked-in time that terrified me . Women in prison tend to nest . There are etiquette rules to obey . Never sit on someone 's cot without permission . Ask to borrow only from someone who receives boxes from home . The women form family groups , with each person in a traditional role . Women love each other in prison . Some exchange rings . Holding hands takes on the intimacy and significance of having sex . When there is time for sex it is always quick . The " family " members in Prison Yard Group Portrait ( pages 38 and 39 ) reveal the relationships they have created . The youngest " children " are enclosed ; the " mother , " a fierce protector , stands out front with hands crossed and feet apart . Tutwiler is one of the few prisons in the United States to have an Aid to Inmate Mothers program . The children are brought to the prison once a month to visit . I began working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inmates with their children ( Young Girls with Beaded Hair in Mama 's Arms , page 44 ) . On Mother 's Day there is a special celebration , and every family has a picnic in the prison yard . The mothers put on a program . That year the theme was " Just Say No to Drugs . " They sang and witnessed to their children . The boy in Mother 's Day Family Portrait ( page 45 ) was part of the program . He recited a poem about staying drug free . The rise and fall of his voice would be familiar to all churchgoers . He sounded like a preacher . His mother cried , she was so proud of her Jimmy . I found out later that the day after I took the photo , Jimmy was killed by a drunk driver . The warden asked me to take portraits of the children visiting their mothers on death row and in the HIV isolation unit . Death row is concrete and gray . The HIV isolation unit is painted shocking pink . In each I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1990 I spent four days in the HIV isolation unit . The women stay there all the time . No church , no work , and all meals are brought to them . It reminded me of a 1950s bomb shelter . Only this time the holocaust is inside . My first day in the unit was Thanksgiving . The prayer before dinner was long . Each woman took turns giving thanks . Every relative had to be mentioned by name . That made them present in the unit . When all the women had prayed , we stood among hundreds of children , husbands , aunts , uncles , cousins , friends , boyfriends , girlfriends , whole congregations of home churches , store clerks , Jesus , Mary , and the Holy Ghost . It began to feel festive . I asked to take a picture ( Thanksgiving Dinner in the HIV Isolation Unit , right ) . They did n't want their faces to show ; most of the women had n't told their families they were HIV-positive . They asked if they could cover their faces . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked up and saw that they had covered each other 's faces . Each hand , an angel 's wing , brushes against a face . The scene looked like the Last Supper with members of the last family . The feeling inside is not bad . The women have painted the walls . Curtains are hung . Beds are always tidy . Mavis , 27 , was the first prisoner to be diagnosed as HIV-positive . This is how the prison first dealt with HIV inmates : she was put on death row for a year . Alone . She never turned on the lights the entire year . The guards were afraid of her and would not take out her garbage . One morning she awoke to find her legs covered with maggots . When she was moved to a private room to visit with her family , the prison was locked down . She was draped in plastic and led down the halls with everyone watching her . It was only after the HIV population reached higher numbers that the isolation unit was set up . Cissy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result in dementia . Her six-year-old son was in the hospital in Ohio with full-blown AIDS . Cissy 's sentence would end three weeks from the time I entered the unit . She had not seen her son , who was said to be dying , for four years . One night Cissy was talking on the phone . She threw it down and screamed . We all knew the boy was dead . No , she said . The governor had given her a pardon for the remainder of her sentence . She left within days and managed to see her son before he died . The women quickly got used to me , and everyone got involved with their own ideas . One woman wanted me to photograph her tattoos ( Tattoo , page 41 ) . Some were her own handiwork : she had been put in segregation and spent the lonely days decorating herself . The handmade ink lines looked like lace drawn on a freckled canvas . Another inmate , Sharon , wanted me to photograph her arms . I had noticed them all week . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All of the women I talked to had suffered some sort of abuse . I rubbed Sharon 's arms one morning ; she looked them over and smiled at me . " These arms are worth a million dollars . I have put a million dollars ' worth of drugs into these arms " ( Million Dollar Arms , page 40 ) . The smile she gave me was one of regret . A smile with no answer to the question of why . Most of the women were n't sad or bitter . I heard regrets , blame , and circumstances . But mostly I heard the cry of the poor . It is not loud . It is low and constant . A stomach rumbling . The engine of an old car trying to start . A hymn . The psychiatric cells are painted green . There is one window in each cell . The inmates are backlit , their hair haloed in the light . One day I spoke to Jackie , an old-timer , in prison most of her life . Her eyes saw only in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sending home , with a drawing she had done of herself . It looked like Jesus . On the card was written " Home of Mine " ( page 42 ) . A few days after I took her picture , she was transferred to a mental institution . A week later she was found dead . Her body was returned to her family . In July 1992 I went in for a week . This time I wanted to photograph in the other sections of Tutwiler . The prison yard is like an elementary school playground . The swings are missing , but the grass is worn down from playing ball . Women huddle together in little groups like schoolgirls sharing secrets . But it does n't sound like a school yard . No games , no laughter , and no running . One day I walked out into the yard with my camera and tripod , feeling intimidated . I was invading private free time . Within minutes , I was encircled by women shouting " Me first ! " and " Can I have one taken all by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) got so tickled when I took her picture . Her laughter was that kind you get in church when serious praying is going on . Unstoppable , deep-down-in-the-gut giggles . Later she told me that it was her first picture in ten years that was n't a mug shot . Fast Black ( right ) is one of the first women I photographed in the yard . Her beauty and elegance are so bright , it is hard to look away . She is confident and well aware of her status . Photographing the women has made them feel good . These forgotten , tucked-away mothers , grandmothers , wives , sisters , lovers , and daughters need some proof that they are not invisible . A picture to mail home . A picture that screams " Do n't forget ! " Melissa Springer is a photographer based in Birmingham , Alabama . <p>
