Section : PERSONAL FINANCE Accounting is often the last thing small business owners think about , when in fact it should be the first . <p> The difficulty of successfully running a business is borne out by statistics showing that half of all start-up businesses will fold within five years . <p> Notably , the number of black-owned companies , which increased by 37.3% throughout the ' 80s , grew more rapidly than the U.S. population as a whole . And sales and receipts from black-owned firms grew even faster , more than doubling during that time . Unfortunately , . black-owned firms fail at a higher rate ( 57.7% ) than companies owned by any other ethnic group . Majority-owned businesses fail at a rate of 49.7% . <p> The reasons for business failure are myriad : poor marketing , undercapitalization and the lack of managerial skills  --  namely the inability to keep accurate and current financial records . <p> Too often , careful accounting is the last thing small business owners think about , when in fact it should be the first . Yes , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  making payroll , acquiring products and selling goods . But business owners put themselves at a competitive disadvantage when they are not accounting-oriented from the very beginning . <p> Many small companies fail to hire an accountant right away , says Wayne O. Leevy , managing partner in the Philadelphia office of Mitchell/Titus &; Co . " You do n't want to be in a situation where even the business structure ( S Corporation , partnership or proprietorship ) is not beneficial to the owners . " <p> Leevy believes every business should start out with three basic advisers : banker , accountant and insurance agent . Before one even starts a business , a visit to an accountant is advised . This way , if nothing else , the businessperson understands the financial reporting responsibilities . An accountant will be helpful in formulating the business plan . <p> There is some fear of accountants , mostly in terms of cost . But getting it right the first time costs less than making up for mistakes the second time around . Besides , there are accounting firms that specialize in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit . <p> After about a year in business , Miami-based Apricot Office Supplies and Stationery Inc. found Watson &; Co. , an accounting firm that also was just starting out . This situation was ideal " because the accountants on staff were formerly CPAs at many of the major accounting firms , " says Apricot 's CEO Basil Bernard . " Since we were one of their first customers , we got top-class advice and recordkeeping at lower rates . " <p> As a business owner who is just starting out , you need to review all the books yourself , says Bernard . " Keeping track of when the bills come in and when they get paid is part common sense . But after a while , you have to concentrate on just running the business . " Getting Your Act Together <p> Accounting is fairly consistent across all business types . Every company needs to maintain a basic recording system , including a bank account that is used for all money transactions . <p> There are five things every business owner should do when dealing with a bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Calif. , CPA who teaches a free course entitled " Recordkeeping for Small Business Owners " at the Entrepreneurial Institute in Los Angeles . They are : Maintain separate business and personal checking accounts . Do n't have an automatic teller machine ( ATM ) card on the business account . Write checks instead of paying for items with cash . They serve as an accurate form of recordkeeping . Reconcile bank accounts monthly and make sure that all errors are corrected . Record all money that is dispersed . <p> " Many small businesspeople have a problem just understanding what they need to use the bank account for , " says Ralph J. Grant , a partner in Oakland , Calif. - based Grant &; Smith . Grant adds that businesspeople tend to spend cash . Or they do not deposit all money received . They also tend to write checks for expenditures. " it is the basics that people do n't get . " <p> One mistake that a lot of small businesses make is to include their sales tax as part of their bank accounts , notes Bernard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're in dire straits to pay the IRS because they thought they had $1,000 in the account when they actually have $900 . " <p> Elliott adds a caveat . If a business owner writes 15 to 20 checks a month , he or she can probably maintain the company 's recordkeeping on ledger books bought from the local office supply store . But if the business is writing 30 checks a month , " the volume is getting more complicated , and the small businessperson is going to need to see an accountant more than once a year , " says Elliott . <p> Outside of balancing a bank account , another basic necessity is to keep files of all important documents . These would include invoices , receipts and contracts . " The filing system can be a problem , " says Grant , especially when documents are not filed systematically or timely . " Putting a rubber band around a bunch of receipts and putting them in a box is not an ideal file . " <p> Computerization is making it easier for small businesses to keep track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Apricot keeps track of some 17,000 products  --  from copiers to pencils  --  via a computer network and inventory software . <p> Using accounting software is just one step . " A software package is helpful , but it 's not sufficient enough in and of itself to avoid using an accountant , " says Joseph Mancuso , president of the Center for Entrepreneurial Management in New York . <p> Good software does n't solve problems , warns Mancuso . Using a computer to keep accurate records may save time and money , by making it easier on a consultant , who wo n't have to rummage through poorly kept records . <p> " We 're meticulous with our recordkeeping , " says Apricot 's Bernard , whose wife , Marlene , is the operations manager and handles the 6-year-old company 's books . Last year , the company did a little over $2 million in sales . <p> CPA Elliott says small businesses should have checklists . Every week , a business should review accounts receivables and take action on slow payers ; review accounts payable ; keep current on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay up to date on payroll . <p> On a monthly basis , a business should scrutinize daily and weekly journals , post numbers to a general ledger ; create a profit-and-loss statement ; reconcile bank accounts ; balance petty cash accounts ; date accounts receivables to see what payments are late ; and perform inventory control to reduce stock that moves slowly and increase items that move quickly . <p> While all of this looks daunting , it really is n't . Aside from that , " accountants are n't miracle workers , " says Bernard . " if you give them garbage , you 'll get garbage back .
