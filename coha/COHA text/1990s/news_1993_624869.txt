<p> DENVER  --  If the Astros fade away in the NL West race this season , something that seems more possible each day , they might mark down June 12 as a date to remember . <p> Ahead of the Colorado Rockies by seven runs in the third inning with Doug Drabek on the mound , the Astros lost 14-11 Saturday night before a crowd of 60,864 at Mile High Stadium . In the stadium was Astros owner Drayton McLane Jr. , watching his first road game of the season . <p> This was hardly the kind of performance that will impress the boss . <p> The Rockies got 14 runs on 19 hits in their final five innings against Drabek and four relievers , who provided very little of that . Drabek , who had suffered from the flu during the week , was racked for nine hits and seven runs in five innings . <p> Closer Doug Jones , who failed to hold a 9-8 lead in the seventh , gave up five consecutive hits and five runs to start the eighth , when the Rockies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their brief history . <p> Fitting that it came against the Astros , who can not beat the best teams in the league or the worst . Colorado is 4-1 against the Astros . The Rockies ' record against the other NL West teams is 2-16 . The Astros are 1-7 against first-place San Francisco and Philadelphia and fell 6 1/2 games behind the Giants . <p> In all , the Rockies had a franchise-high 20 hits . Dante Bichette and Charlie Hayes each went 4-for-5 . Someone named J. Owens , a backup catcher , went 3-for-3 with three RBIs , his first in the majors . <p> " " We 'd better buckle down and turn it around somehow , " said manager Art Howe . " " Once they got it going , we could n't shut it down , no matter who we threw out there . Offensively , we did everything we could do . We just could n't stop them . " Astros catcher Eddie Taubensee 's fourth hit of the game drove in two runs in the ninth inning to put both teams in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> This was a game the Astros should have won going away . <p> Instead , they went away from Mile High Stadium with the sickening feeling that comes when a team starts a gradual slide from contention . Losing to the worst team in baseball after having a seven-run lead with your ace on the mound can have that effect . <p> " " It 's time for us to pick each other up and pat each other on the back , " said right fielder Eric Anthony . " " Good teams do that . We 'll have to do it right now , stop what 's going on . " <p> The Astros continued their nothing-is-easy style of play against the Rockies . Not even a 7-0 lead by the middle of the third inning with Drabek on the mound made for a sure thing . <p> By the fourth , the Rockies had climbed to within 7-4 . By the sixth , when Drabek was knocked out , the Astros ' lead was a scant 9-8 . By the seventh , with Jones already on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who retired nine of the first 11 batters he faced , suddenly could n't get anyone out . The final 15 batters he faced collected eight hits and two walks as seven runs scored . In the fourth , six straight Rockies reached base , four scored and  --  just like that  --  a potential laugher had become serious . <p> " " I got that big lead and then got inconsistent , " said Drabek . " " I was leaving balls in the hitting zone , and they were hitting them . I just did n't do a very good job of pitching tonight . " <p> The Astros built their lead against Rockies starter Andy Ashby , the worst pitcher on the worst staff in baseball . Ashby brought in a 6.94 ERA in 15 games . In his last five starts , he had allowed 48 hits and 30 runs in 22 innings . <p> The third inning was expansion baseball at its worst . Though the Rockies infielders had not made an error in the last 70 innings , they committed three in a seven-batter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blame , of course . Craig Biggio led off with his 11th homer . Remarkably , Biggio , their leadoff hitter , took over the club lead in homers with his second in two nights , third on the road trip and seventh since May 23 . <p> After a walk to Steve Finley , first baseman Andres Galarraga dropped a throw from third baseman Hayes , turning a routine out into an error . More would follow . <p> One out later , Ken Caminiti 's two-run double gave the Astros a 5-0 lead . A single by Andujar Cedeno made it 6-0 and knocked out Ashby , who certainly can not be long for even the Rockies ' rotation . <p> Reliever Scott Fredrickson came in and got what looked like an inning-ending double play . Instead , second baseman Eric Young made one wild throw and Hayes made another to home plate after retrieving the ball . The end result was another run that gave Drabek a 7-0 lead . <p> Ready for a ho-hum win ? Not so fast . Drabek had allowed only one hit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourth . The avalanche was about to begin . <p> Galarraga hit his eighth homer . A double by Hayes and single by Jerald Clark made it 7-3 . A walk and single by Daryl Boston , who snapped an 0-for-22 slump , loaded the bases . <p> Only a good play by Cedeno at short , who turned a potential single into a force out at third , saved more damage . The four-run fourth did , however , get the Rockies back in the game . <p> Taubensee 's second RBI single of the game , this one off lefthander Gary Wayne , increased the lead to 8-4 in the fifth . But the Rockies did n't let up against Drabek , getting the run back . <p> Through five innings , the Astros had an 8-5 lead . The teams had combined for 14 hits and 13 runs . There had been four errors  - -  all by the Rockies  --  and three wild pitches . For good measure ( or bad ) , there also were six walks and a balk . <p> Gonzalez 's single off Wayne made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk and a double to Boston to make it 9-6 and was relieved by Xavier Hernandez in the bottom of the inning . And Hernandez could n't stop the bleeding . <p> A squib single by Owens made it 9-7 . A single under the glove of Jose Uribe , who entered at shortstop as part of a double switch , made it 9-8 . But Hernandez got Galarraga to hit into a double play and the Astros clung ever so gingerly to a one-run lead . <p> Even that disappeared in the seventh . With two outs and nobody on , Howe lifted Hernandez for Al Osuna , who gave up a single to Nelson Liriano before an error on Uribe . On came Jones , who gave up a two-strike single to Owens that tied the game and left the Astros on the verge of their biggest embarrassment of the season . <p> " " I thought we finally were going to get him ( Drabek ) a nice , easy win , " said Howe . " " But when you give up 14 runs in five innings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , easy for everyone else in the league , has been next to impossible for the Astros . If they ca n't turn it around today , they can point to this weekend as the point when things started to come undone .
