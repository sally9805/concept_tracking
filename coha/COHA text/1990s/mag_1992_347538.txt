Instead the report detailed violence and torture within the A.N.C . itself . The inquiry was ordered by A.N.C . president Nelson Mandela to settle allegations by former detainees of atrocities committed against them by the A.N.C . ' s security department in its detention camps . Conceding that the abuses had violated the A.N.C . ' s own code of conduct , Mandela promised the report would be considered " as a matter of grave urgency . " <P> While the A.N.C . was admitting its abuse of power , South African President F.W. de Klerk was pushing a bill through Parliament that would allow unelected persons to be appointed to the Cabinet , opening the way for blacks in the government for the first time . But De Klerk had less success with a law giving amnesty for undetailed politically motivated crimes . The bill was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bill through his President 's council , circumventing Parliament . But that , said the a.n.c. , would only demonstrate his desperation to cover up the crimes of apartheid .
