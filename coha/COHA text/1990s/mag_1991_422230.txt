Section : WALKER 'S WORLD Try a dose of inspiration from physicians who prescribe walking and practice what they preach <p> WHEN YOU GO TO BUY A car , it 's nice to know that your salesman personally owns the kind of car he sells . After all , it hardly instills confidence in you when your local Chevy dealer is seen cruising around town in a Toyota . Likewise , when you go to a doctor , his advice always seems to carry a little more weight when he follows it himself . Be honest . How easy is it for you to take your doctor 's advice to start exercising seriously when he 's got the paunch of a junior sumo wrestler ? <p> Luckily , the heydays of overweight , cigarette-smoking , Twinkie-eating M.D. 's are over . More than ever , health practitioners are practicing what they prescribe . And more than ever they 're prescribing walking . <p> We went in search of doctors who make it a point to prescribe walking to their patients because they do it themselves and have firsthand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter of fact , the following stories seemed especially inspirational to us because these people are clinical professionals and know good results when they see them . So if you 've been all excuses and no footwork lately , read on and see if these stories are n't just the medicine you need to get moving . THE FAMILY DOCTOR <p> Neil Block , M.D. , of Orangeburg , New York , is 39 years old and has been a family physician for nine years . He walks 40 to 60 minutes , three to four times a week , at a speedy 12-minute-per-mile pace . <p> His walks take him around the neighborhood , a nearby lake or in the local mall . His favorite times are before lunch or dinner . But sometimes he walks before bedtime . <p> " It 's just not always true that exercising before going to bed disturbs your sleep pattern , " he says . " Some people can and some ca n't . I once had a hypertensive patient whose only free time was in the late evening . Because he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medication instead . Within four months of seeing me , he was off medication . Why ? I recommended that he start walking again , even if it was late ! If your doctor says you can exercise , go ahead and see for yourself if you can handle evening workouts . " <p> Dr. Block began walking to ease moderate back pain and to keep his weight in check . He knows its value as a preventive strategy against coronary-artery disease . And he loves getting a good night 's sleep . <p> " I not only sleep very well after I 've walked , but I 'm also able to fall asleep faster . As a result , I feel more energetic the next day . " <p> Dr. Block tells almost all his patients to walk . He 's seen many improvements take place in people 's lives with moderate exercise . Like an emphysema patient who can now walk to stores and the library  --  who formerly had to be carried in a car . " You ca n't grow new air sacs , but you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong . You can make your chest into a better bellows by walking . " <p> Sometimes Dr. Block walks with patients around the lake , and in winter they head for the mall or to a local spa to use a treadmill . <p> " I am very persuasive with my patients , " he says . " Walking is part of a healthy lifestyle . My card says ' Family Practice  --  Lifestyle Changes . ' Correct habits create health . Walking creates health . " DIETITIAN <p> Nadine Braunstein is a registered dietitian in Boston . She 's really learned to incorporate walking into her lifestyle . When possible 's very reinforcing when we walk together . My clients seem to get a better understanding of just how important walking is . It helps to motivate them . I even show them how to do stretches . <p> " Walking meetings are especially effective for people who have eating disorders . They really start to relax and open up when we walk and talk together . " <p> Ms. Braunstein walks with clients about three times a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does errands or anytime it 's convenient . " I try to make it part of my normal routine , " she says . " I walk to my aerobics classes . Rather than chat on the phone with friends , we prefer to meet and go for a walk together . " <p> Not having a car for four years when she got out of college helped create that walking lifestyle . " Then I walked because I had to . Now I walk because I want to , " she says . <p> Braunstein never considered herself an athlete . " In high school I was always the last person chosen for a team . I had a weight problem back then , but not anymore . Walking is the perfect exercise for me . " SPECIALIST <p> Robert Lang , M.D. , is the medical director of the Osteoporosis Diagnostic and Treatment Centers in New Haven and Bridgeport , Connecticut . He walks three to five miles a day . On weekends he walks in the morning ; during the week , after dinner . " I make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health is one of my highest priorities . " <p> Dr. Lang is a former runner with a need for something gentler on the knees . Also , walking allows him to spend more time with his wife . Ten years ago , Dr. Lang was facing probable back surgery . " I had a ruptured disk , asthma , colitis , " he says . " I was overweight and underexercised . That potential back surgery really kept me motivated to stay with walking . Today I 'm trim , and all the other problems are a thing of the past . I eat mostly grains and vegetables , and I plan to walk as often as I can . " <p> Specializing in osteoporosis for 20 years , he sees people with fractures and other complications . If it 's appropriate ( and it usually is ) , he recommends stretching and walking to them . <p> " People are finally beginning to think about prevention , " he says . " More and more women are starting to come to me saying , ' How can I prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can increase their bone density through proper nutrition and exercise . Also , we now know that osteoporosis is a stress-related disease . You ca n't absorb calcium properly if you 're under stress . So walking helps both as a weight-bearing exercise and as a stress reducer . " <p> Dr. Lang recommends that his patients walk for 20 minutes five or six days a week , as their condition permits . " The ones who 've already had lots of problems are more compliant . They know what they 're avoiding by exercising . It 's so simple . No health clubs , no equipment . Some stretching and off you go . " SURGEON <p> F. Hampton Roy , M.D. , is an eye surgeon at the Arkansas Cataract Center , Little Rock . He 's been walking for exercise since 1974 . His schedule now is eight miles , three days a week . How does he do it ? <p> " I wanted it to be practical , " says Dr. Roy . " It 's eight miles to my office . I walk there in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Dr. Roy 's walks help keep him healthy and calm . " I feel at peace after my walks , " he says . " I do n't use tapes . I go the same route every day . I do n't carry my beeper . I have an agenda of things to think about . It 's like a meditation time for me . Two of the days that I walk , I do eye surgery , " Dr. Roy says . " I leave the house at 5:00 a.m. , get to the office at 6:45 or so and go to the operating room till 11:30 or 12:00 . Walking before surgery helps me stay more relaxed . <p> " We see people whose general health is not good . I frequently recommend walking to them , because it reduces stress and can have a positive effect on circulation . <p> " I have had many patients improve their overall health by walking . Some patients think walking is just too simple , and that 's a shame . They do n't understand the benefits of regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prescription , I still encourage them to walk . Walking asks that patients take some responsibility for their own health . My patients need to be educated to that idea . " A NEW PERSPECTIVE ON WALKING <p> All these practitioners would probably agree that many people need to look at exercise in a different light . As they age they may begin to look at exercise as some type of physical therapy that they can apply if they have the time or the motivation . But is it reasonable to expect that your body can stay healthy without exercise , without something like a daily walk ? A lot of research seems to indicate that the answer is no . Exercise is n't optional . <p> As Prevention Editor Mark Bricklin remarked in a speech before the Commonwealth Club of California , " Do n't think of walking as a physical or emotional therapy . Think of it as a basic human need , like food , sleep , companionship and love . " <p> By Maggie Spilner <p> NATURALSPORT GRAND-PRIX FINALS !
