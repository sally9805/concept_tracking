<p> A war has broken out here over the future of Iowa 's pork industry , the largest single component of a state economy dominated by agriculture . <p> Big corporate hog producers are invading the state , constructing huge facilities here and in other Iowa towns that yield with assembly-line efficiency growing amounts of leaner pork that health-conscious consumers prize . Iowa must adapt to these changes , they argue , or witness the slow decline of the state 's most important economic activity . <p> But critics contend the new hog factories are destroying the quality of their lives with intolerable odors and the threat of ground water contamination . And alongside the environmental issue , there is growing anxiety that the large producers eventually will cripple the traditional backbone of Iowa agriculture , the family farm . It is not just the air and water that are threatened , critics argue , but a way of life . <p> " The real issue in the minds of most people in the Midwest is the structure of the industry , that it 's more important to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dean of the College of Agriculture at Iowa State University . <p> The controversy prompted the Des Moines Register to commission a statewide public opinion poll in August that found 53 percent of Iowans think state laws should not encourage large hog operations . Not surprisingly , the strongest opposition was in rural Iowa . <p> Gov . Terry E. Branstad ( R ) has established a task force headed by Topel to study the environmental issues in the dispute while a separate body appointed by state legislators is doing the same . When the legislature convenes in January , there is certain to be a flurry of measures introduced to restrict the growth of the large hog farms . <p> In anticipation , the pork industry has formed the Iowa Pork Alliance with former governor Robert Ray ( R ) as its honorary chairman and chief spokesman in television commercials that remind Iowans of the industry 's importance to the economy . <p> Hogs are big business here  --  pork from production to processing is the state 's biggest industry . Iowa accounts for 25 percent of the nation 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carolina . The number of hog producers is continuing to decline while total production has increased to more than 25 million hogs a year . At any given time , Iowa has far more pigs ( about 14 million at last count ) than people ( 2.7 million ) . <p> But the industry is undergoing a transformation nationally that is having an enormous impact here . It was large , corporate producers who moved North Carolina into second place in the hog derby this year , overtaking Illinois , and they are now expanding to other states as well , including Iowa . <p> Much the same thing happened in the poultry industry 40 years ago . In 1958 , Topel recalled , Iowa was the nation 's leading poultry producer . But Iowans , with their almost mythical view of the family farm , resisted an influx of corporate poultry operators and the state was soon overtaken by Arkansas and other localities  --  Maryland and Virginia among them . <p> Pork is far more important to Iowa than the poultry industry ever was . According to a survey by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ark. , which already dominates the poultry industry , also has become the nation 's fourth-largest pork producer with operations in five states . Iowa is not among them . <p> " The fact is that Iowa is losing its grip on the industry , " said Chad Hagen , director of nutrition and finishing operations for Iowa Select Farms here . " The industry is starting to leave the state . " <p> Iowa Select Farms is one of the biggest of the new breed of hog producers . Founded two years ago by Jeff Hansen , 36 , a third-generation farmer from Iowa Falls , the company is working about 12,000 sows at four locations . Each sow will produce more than 20 pigs a year , well above the state average of 14 . After a three-week stay at company-owned nurseries near the sow facilities , young hogs are shipped to " finishing facilities " like the 10 barns that Iowa Select owns near here and 40 others where other farmers feed the hogs under contract with the firm . <p> It is this production system , coupled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is revolutionizing the pork industry . On the typical family hog farm raising 100 to 300 sows , the farmer does it all at one location , which increases the risk of disease . In some cases , the animals may rummage in the outdoors or be confined in drafty , old barns , which during Iowa 's harsh winters means weight gain comprises more fat and less of the lean pork that consumers are demanding . Iowa Select 's hogs never leave their climate-controlled , steel barns except for transfers between locations , including their final destination after six months at a packing plant . <p> All of this takes a lot of money , which the corporate producers can afford to invest . But Hagen , 38 , who grew up on a southern Minnesota family hog farm that eventually failed , argues that small producers who have kept up with changes in the industry can continue to prosper next to the corporate behemoths . " We 're not going to drive them off the farm , " he said . In the meantime , Hagen added , Iowa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficient small producers will not survive , Hagen concedes . " It 's not Joe Smith , car dealer , who 's going broke ; it 's Joe Smith , family farmer , " he said . " That 's what makes it so emotional . " <p> One recent night activists like Becky Cole , whose home is within a mile of the Select Farms site , and Ann Pellegreno , a local writer , gathered in a community lodge in nearby Story City to voice their complaints about what Pellegreno calls " the hog factory " up the road . " You can not leave your windows open at night for fear your whole house will be full of it , " Cole , 45 , said of the odor . <p> " We know what hog manure smells like , but this is like a sewer , " added Jesse Overland , 75 , a retired farmer . <p> Pellegreno 's objections go beyond odor . " We want Iowa farmland farmed by Iowa farmers , " she said . " We do n't like what we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Iowa family farmer is the one who brought Iowa to first in pork production . " <p> There are fewer and fewer family farms to protect . Between 1954 and 1992 , the number of hog farms in the state declined from 152,386 to 34,058 , according to the U.S. Census of Agriculture . Compounding the dwindling numbers is a demographic fact of life in rural America  --  the population is aging while the number of young people who are willing and able to assume the debt and uncertainty of farming is declining . <p> The average age of Iowa hog producers is about 55 . Many of these farmers are raising hogs in aging facilities with outdated equipment that will require thousands of dollars in new investments if they are to compete with the high-tech corporate operators . <p> " If you are 55 to 60 , what would you do if no family member is interested in farming ? " Topel said . " Would you borrow money ? That 's what many Iowa farmers have to decide in the next five years . " <p> Typical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dick Bengtson , 63 . He still raises corn and soybeans near here , but he got out of hog farming several years ago after the last of his six children left the family farm . <p> " I guess they kind of saw the handwriting on the wall , " he said of his children 's decision to opt for a non-farm way of life . " If you are going to farm in the future , you 've got to be big . " <p> As the battle approaches in the state legislature , many rural Iowans appear fearful but almost resigned to the changes sweeping over their state 's key industry . <p> Arden Tweeten , 64 , a grain farmer in Woolstock , has formed the Organization for the Protection of the Environment to fight the big producers . He argues that their concentration of so many hogs on such relatively small amounts of land will inevitably lead to ground water contamination from manure runoff . He also worries that the corporate operations are " going to drive out people like my son and other farmers who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledged as he considered the problem : " We probably ca n't change it . Maybe it 's a trend of the times . What we 're trying to do is to get them to build the facilities so the community can live with them . " <p> Topel said eventually the large producers could account for 20 percent of Iowa 's total hog production , with the rest in the hands of more traditional family farms . But that will depend in part on how the small producers react to the new challenge . <p> " When we meet with people , we emphasize that you can have both but you ca n't operate like you did 20 years ago , " he said .
