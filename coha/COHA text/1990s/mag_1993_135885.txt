The Hurley family of Jersey City has been an advertisement for basketball and family values . Twenty years ago Bob , then a young coach at St. Anthony 's High , would set his son Bobby 's crib at courtside while he put his players through their paces . Later Bobby and his younger brother , Danny , starred for their dad , helping bring national recognition to a school that does n't even have a gymnasium . The boys ' mother , Chris , has always been in the middle of the basketball stew , cheerleading , counseling , refereeing , organizing and , these days , banking . " The checks go right home to my mother , " Bobby , a rookie making close to $3 million a year with the Sacramento Kings , said not long ago . // But good families suffer misfortune , too , and the Hurleys got a double dose last week . On Friday a reportedly troubled Danny , a starting point guard for Seton Hall , abruptly left the team . His departure was not explained  --  coach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not quit but " asked for some time off "  --  but it was not inexplicable . Danny , who was averaging only 3.5 points , possesses neither Bobby 's quickness nor his tenacity and feel for the game . He had been frustrated by the booing he sometimes received at the Meadowlands , Seton Hall 's home arena , saying at one point last season , " I ca n't take it anymore . I enjoy playing road games a hundred times more . " Insiders said that the burden of trying to live up to his brother 's accomplishments had begun to eat away at him . // Early Monday morning the Hurleys received even more jolting news . Almost an hour after the Kings lost 112-102 to the Los Angeles Clippers in Sacramento 's Arco Arena , Bobby was thrown from his light truck in a two-vehicle collision . Later in the morning Bobby 's condition at the University of California-Davis Medical Center in Sacramento had been upgraded from critical to serious . However , his doctors said his injuries were life threatening . Hurley 's most serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during eight hours of surgery . Bobby also suffered two collapsed lungs , broken ribs , a compression fracture in the middle of his back and ligament damage to one of his knees . // As it happened , for perhaps the first time in his life Bobby was having as difficult a time on the basketball court as Danny . A six-foot point guard severely restrained by gravity , Bobby would have had a difficult adjustment to the NBA even without the pressure of a six-year , $16.2 million salary , the inflated expectations of the lowly Kings ( who had made him the seventh pick of the 1993 draft ) and his role as spokesman for a new line of sneakers . He was averaging 7.1 points and 6.1 assists and was only two of 16 from three-point range . On many occasions he had looked like the same sad-eyed kid who during a memorably bad 1990 NCAA championship game performance against UNLV  --  he finished with two points and five turnovers in a 103-73 Duke loss  --  left the court because he became physically ill . Though he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been at the Meadowlands , neither had the King faithful been bending at the waist to give Bobby the we-are-not-worthy bow , as Duke 's Cameron Crazies did last February when his number 11 jersey was retired . // Back in Jersey City , Bob and Chris saw most of Bobby 's rookie frustrations on the satellite dish in their working-class brick row house . At about 1 a.m. on Monday they were awakened by two calls , one from Bobby 's girlfriend , Ana Quinones , the other from King coach Garry St. Jean , informing them that their son was in critical condition . According to police Bobby 's truck had been rammed on the driver 's side , near the front , by a station wagon being operated without headlights at a speed of between 50 and 60 mph . The driver of the wagon , Daniel Wieland , 37 , was in fair condition with a fractured leg . // The collision occurred as Bobby made a left turn at a stop sign , about a mile from the arena . The impact sent his truck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheel and part of the axle . Bobby was thrown through the door on the driver 's side and found in a drainage canal next to a field . He had been flung 40 feet . Police said the alcohol-blood levels were zero for both drivers . // According to police-Hurley had not been wearing a seat belt . " This his condition is remarkable , considering he was ejected from the vehicle , " said Richard Marder , an orthopedic surgeon and the Kings ' team doctor . // After news of the accident spread , Sacramento general manager Jerry Reynolds rushed to the hospital , as did Quinones and a handful of fans and teammates , including fellow rookie Mike Peplowski , who had come upon the accident scene and accompanied Bobby to the hospital . They were joined by the retired bishop of Sacramento , Father Francis A. Quinn , who , aware that Bobby had gone to a school called St. Anthony 's , showed up still in pajamas . Many of them were there Monday morning when Bob and Chris arrived to see their son , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was too soon to tell if Hurley could return to basketball . // The same can be said for Danny . Back in Jersey City he and Bobby shared a bedroom , and Bob Sr. once referred to them as soul mates . However , no one except Danny will ever know how hard it is to live in the shadow of a classic overachiever like Bobby , a four-year Duke starter , a two-time NCAA champion and college basketball 's alltime assist leader . // Nine days before the accident the brothers had been together in a typical Hurley basketball convergence . Danny watched Bobby play against the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden in the afternoon , and Bobby watched Danny play against St. John 's in the Garden that night . " This is a sweet week for me , " Bobby had written a few days earlier in the journal that appears in the Sacramento Bee . " I ca n't wait to get home . " On the last day of the Kings ' eastern swing  --  the same day Danny left the Seton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Bobby rooters in Philadelphia who watched the Kings win 109-103. // Weeks earlier a bus trip to that game had been announced in the Jersey City paper , The Jersey Journal , with the notation : " Please call Chris Hurley . " // One can only hope that there will be other Hurley bus trips and , for both sons , other games .
