During last month 's Paris shows for ready-to-wear fall clothing , director Robert Altman appeared with stars like Sophia Loren and Julia Roberts to shoot scenes for his new film , Pret-a-Porter ( Ready-to-Wear ) . At first the fashion community welcomed him  --  what a chance to show off ! What free advertising ! But a chill quickly set in . Banning the movie crew from his show , Chanel designer Karl Lagerfeld said , " I 'm afraid Robert Altman will make fashion look like a nightmarish cartoon . " Evidently Lagerfeld has not noticed that he and his colleagues have achieved that all by themselves . The depressing news of the fall collections just shown in Paris , Milan and New York is that the nightmare is far from over . <P> An epidemic of cynicism passing for wit has overtaken fashion as designers work harder at being funny than at crafting beautiful clothes . There has always been a theatrical side to fashion , a love of the extreme . But lately the over-the-top gesture is usurping the real thing . A decent goal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but styles in the past few seasons have often made a grotesque distortion of the natural silhouette . Interruption in the form of extravagant collars , peplums and other superfluous add-ons to skirts has replaced any graceful flow . Having peaked several years ago , multiple layering is back , even bulkier and more intrusive than in its last incarnation . All the elements that make a great dress  --  materials , tailoring , imagination  --  seem to have been degraded . <P> When the venerable house of Chanel shows a black fur hat the size and shape of Mickey Mouse 's ears , as it did this spring , something is wrong . Lagerfeld 's other japes included fuzzy fake-fur skirts shaped unmistakably like muffs that barely covered the buttocks . He has made the classic Chanel suit look tartier by the year , a crude parody of itself . At this point it would be preferable  --  and more courageous  --  to retire it altogether ; versions of the design go back to the ' 20s , so the suit may have run its course . Lagerfeld has also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accessories and jacket backs . <P> Jean-Paul Gaultier first made a corset-like bustier for Madonna four years ago , and it was a good joke . Now further variations of underwear as outerwear have overtaken the runways . So have other tired gambits , which can only encourage a woman to stay out of the stores and wear what she already has in the closet . The metallic look is suffering from fatigue , but it 's still in favor . And nobody looks good in disheveled fake fur , now everywhere . The effect is to present a woman as an unclipped poodle who just swam a stream and had a good , vigorous shake .
