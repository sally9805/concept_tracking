<p> The directors of " Bugsy " and " JFK " enjoyed a feeling of vindication yesterday as their movies racked up 10 and eight Oscar nominations , respectively , for the 64th annual Academy Awards . Barbra Streisand had a bittersweet celebration , snubbed in the Best Director category even though her " Prince of Tides " scored seven nominations , including Best Picture . <p> " Bugsy " director Barry Levinson described his film 's first-place finish as the culmination of " an uphill battle against a lot of negative vibes . " Other gangster movies did n't do well last year , he noted , and audiences were n't flocking to see another effort in that genre . Added James Toback , who was nominated for his " Bugsy " screenplay : " I was hoping to get enough votes to give the movie a transfusion . Otherwise it would have just died . " <p> Warren Beatty , nominated for his role as the notorious gangster Benjamin Siegel , said he was " surprised we got the audience we did . ... I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you get to like him at all , gets killed off in the end ? You know going in that you 're not making ' Raiders of the Lost Ark . ' " <p> Oliver Stone , whose " JFK " was denounced as a distorted political polemic in many quarters , said : " The people voted , in a way . The people came to the movies in large quantities ; that 's a vindication in itself . " <p> Like " Bugsy , " " JFK " could use a box office boost , though " The Prince of Tides " is still holding in the Top 10 . All three films were nominated for Best Picture , along with the psycho-thriller " The Silence of the Lambs " and the animated Disney romance " Beauty and the Beast . " A slight , if not staggering surprise , " B &B"; is the first animated feature ever nominated in this category . " It 's a historic day for us animator folk , " said producer Don Hahn , who got up at 5:30 a.m. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little coffee . " <p> Disney Chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg was also ecstatic about the nomination , one of six in all for the film . Just getting the nomination was a triumph , he said in a voice hoarse from accepting congratulations . <p> There were other history-making nominations . The academy recognized , for the first time , a black director , John Singleton . His Best Director nomination for " Boyz N the Hood " also makes him , at 24 , the youngest filmmaker ever to be nominated in the category . Singleton also was nominated for Best Original Screenplay for his first film , a coming-of-age story set in a tough Los Angeles neighborhood . He wrote " Boyz " as his final 1990 project at the University of Southern California 's undergraduate Filmic Writing Program , and the picture was made for a mere $ 6 million . <p> " The Silence of the Lambs ' " producer Ken Utt , a self-described North Carolina pea picker , was " absolutely tickled to death " with the film 's seven nominations . " The movie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Utt , who sends his thanks to all the G-men who helped make the film a success . " If we win or not , it 's still terrific . " <p> Meanwhile , some in Hollywood were not crowing but carping . <p> In a statement , Mark Canton , chairman of Columbia Pictures , called it " truly shocking that Barbra Streisand was overlooked as a Best Director nominee for ' The Prince of Tides . ' We think this is Barbra 's movie , and that she deserves recognition for the absolutely vital role she played in every aspect of making the film . " ( Her male lead , Nick Nolte , was nominated , as expected . ) <p> The fact that she received a Best Director tap for " Prince " from the Director 's Guild " makes this oversight ... particularly hard to accept , " wrote Canton , who went to Columbia after the picture was filmed . ( Previously he was at Warner Bros. , which passed on " Prince . " ) <p> But some in Hollywood said the temperamental Streisand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rival studio said , " People try to make you believe it 's a thing about women . It 's about her . It 's about being Barbra Streisand . " <p> Streisand 's directorial work on 1983 's " Yentl " also was snubbed , though the film won for Best Original Song Score or Adaptation . <p> Ridley Scott was nominated for his direction of the distaff road picture " Thelma &; Louise , " whose leading ladies Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon were nominated for Best Actress , along with Jodie Foster ( " The Silence of the Lambs " ) , Laura Dern ( " Rambling Rose " ) and Bette Midler ( " For the Boys " ) . <p> Midler , who also won a Golden Globe for her role as a brassy USO entertainer , sent a fax : " I always knew my fellow actors had exquisite taste . But seriously , I 'm absolutely knocked out . " Word is that Academy members felt sorry for Midler , who has been distraught over the titanic failure of " Boys . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work as " Bugsy 's " slinky moll went unrecognized . " I told Jim Toback the Academy might blame her for Bugsy 's death , " said Levinson , who has been around long enough now to understand these things . Beatty was disappointed for his leading lady : " I was surprised , because the picture worked because of her performance . " <p> Nolte 's Oscar nomination , for his role as the repressed coach of " The Prince of Tides , " was his first . He has already received a Golden Globe and a Los Angeles Film Critics ' award . He is expected to win the statuette over his fellow nominees  --  Robin Williams ( " The Fisher King " ) , Robert De Niro ( " Cape Fear " ) , Anthony Hopkins ( " The Silence of the Lambs " ) and Beatty . <p> One notable omission from the Best Actor list was " JFK " star Kevin Costner . Oliver Stone expressed disappointment : " Considering what this movie has been through , it is really wonderful to have your peers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who did a powerful job of anchoring this movie in an underestimated way , but I am very , very happy for Tommy Lee Jones , for whom it has been a long time coming . " <p> Jones was nominated for Best Supporting Actor for his role of Clay Shaw , one of the conspirators in " JFK . " His competition in the category includes Harvey Keitel and Ben Kingsley of " Bugsy , " Michael Lerner of " Barton Fink " and Jack Palance of " City Slickers . " Palance , who has n't been nominated since his heyday in the ' 50s , will probably nab the prize for a lifetime 's achievement . <p> Diane Ladd , nominated last year for " Wild at Heart , " is in the running again for Best Supporting Actress for her role as the sensible matriarch in " Rambling Rose . " A relentless self-promoter , she faces feisty competition from Juliette Lewis , the teenage prey in " Cape Fear " ; Kate Nelligan , the mother in " The Prince of Tides " ; Mercedes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and Jessica Tandy , the storytelling granny in " Fried Green Tomatoes . " The race is wide open . <p> " Bugsy " likely has the inside track now for Best Picture , though pre-nomination conventional wisdom had favored " Prince of Tides . " Now people say the academy will not give its top honor to a a picture about a serial killer who dresses in human skin , or a much-maligned political polemic ... but then , what do they know . <p> AND THE NOMINEES ARE ... <p> PICTURE : " Beauty and the Beast , " " Bugsy , " " JFK , " " The Prince of Tides , " " The Silence of the Lambs .
