I was born in Boston on October 24 , 1926 , and writing about a subject as to which personal perspective means so much , I find it incumbent to give some account of my own religion as it was exercised from that date forward . I will begin with a bit of family history . // My father 's grandfather was a Protestant . He must have been Presbyterian , for he came from Scotland , but nothing was ever said in family memory of his specific denomination , because when he married my great-grandmother he became a Catholic , as was she . Over five centuries , all Protestants have had Catholic ancestors , and many Catholics have had Protestant ancestors , making the Christian community as a whole more of a family than is often acknowledged . In this case , the extra seriousness of the adult convert had a surprising result : the couple 's two sons became priests of the diocese of Worcester . Three of the four daughters remained unmarried  --  " the girls in Springfield , " as they were called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only my grandmother married and perpetuated the line . // On my mother 's side there were only Catholics and , as far as I know , no ecclesiastical connections . Growing up in Concord , Massachusetts , she had a faithful friend and wise counselor in her pastor , Matthew or Mattie Flaherty ; and Father Flaherty , as he was alliteratively known , remained until his death a family friend , closer geographically and empathically than the somewhat remote and reserved uncles in Worcester . // My parents were married in 1925 in St. Mary 's in Brookline , where my mother had moved . Monsignor Splaine , the pastor , presided , as canon law provided . I often heard the story . " The uncles are all right , " he said , i.e. , the two priests from Worcester could sit on the altar , " but Mattie will have to stay to home , " i.e. , he was not to intrude into the monsignor 's domain , a conclusion dictated by church politics and a sense of territoriality . To outsiders the Catholic Church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parish was the operative unit of everyday life , the religious orders provided variety , and there were intense internal battles . // To isolate my religious education from the rest of my experience is to compose an artifact , arbitrary but for its relevance to the themes of this book . Specifically religious instruction began with my mother , who taught me to pray . She herself prayed regularly and , basing herself on experience , believed in the power of prayer . Her religious views were wide in the respect she accorded other faiths  --  she had been educated by similarly broad-minded nuns and priests at Trinity College in Washington  --  and she had no use for a bigotry that denied the sincerity , the goodness , and the ultimate salvation of those not of her persuasion . She had a number of close friendships with Protestants , formed chiefly in her Concord schooldays . She had more Catholic friends , including two members of the Congregation of Notre Dame de Namur , one ex-nun of that order , and one ex-postulant ; those who had left the religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mother valued their prayers and their love . // My father should also be described as a religious man , although one less confident of eliciting the responses of God . His mind was critical , and he examined theological doctrines as well as priestly pronouncements from the pulpit critically . Wholly committed to Catholicism  --  what else was there ? he thought  --  he meditated a good deal on its paradoxes and problems . As he and I grew older , he took delight in theological debate . I remember keenly his assaults on the teaching that then passed as orthodox , and had for over a millennium , that an ideal state would repress by force any heretical deviation from the Church ; incredulity and scorn characterized his reaction to the doctrine . At a later date I recall his tormenting Richard McBrien , then teaching theology at Boston College , with the question , " What is the difference between begotten ' and made ' in the statement of the Creed that the Son was begotten not made ' ? " And at a later date I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffered on the cross if he was conscious that he was God as well as man . At the same time as he grew older his devotion to Lourdes , where he and my mother went as volunteers , grew . He was willing to believe that miracles had occurred there ; it was the concreteness of the proofs that caught his eye and mind . And he translated from the French a long biography of Bernadette Soubirous. // In this household , attendance at Sunday mass was a matter of course , never questioned , never neglected ; and similarly attendance on all holy days of obligation . After my father 's mother 's death we usually went to mass on her anniversary ; other ordinary days we did not . On Good Friday , from the age of about eleven , I would go to the Three Hours with my mother ; the sermon sequence on those occasions is the only long exposure to preaching that I experienced . // There were sermons  --  very short by Protestant standards , too long by ours  --  given usually , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thing , not the preaching . The latter was rarely eloquent and sometimes incoherent ; delivery ranged from mediocre to bad . I can not recall social issues or party politics ever being discussed . Sin was a topic , sex in general was referred to , materialism was often denounced . A literal-minded paraphrasing of the gospel of the day was standard . Memory does call from its depths several Jesuits and one or two Redemptorists who spoke with fire while preaching retreats . // An event that took place as much as three or four times a year was a letter , read from the pulpit , opening with the salutation , " To the clergy and faithful of the archdiocese of Boston , health and benediction ! " and concluding with the signature , " William Cardinal O'Connell , archbishop of Boston . " The cardinal lived in an Italianate palazzo on Commonwealth Avenue , which was pointed out to me as a child from a distance . The letters were how he was chiefly present to the parishes . He , or his ghostwriters , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to match the portliness of the cardinal himself . It was in observing the cardinal 's relationship to civic affairs that I gained my first sense of the difference between the Church and governmental authorities and the interaction between them . // William Henry O'Connell was born in Lowell , Massachusetts , in 1859 and lived until 1944 . Educated at Boston College and the North American College in Rome , of which he was later rector , he had been appointed coadjutor with right of succession in 1906 and had become the archbishop the next year ; he was promoted to the cardinalate in 1911 by Pius X ; and he continued as cardinal-archbishop until his death . Coming into office in 1906 at the age of forty-seven , a man of energy , ambition , and political adroitness , he personified the Catholic Church to the world in Boston . He was resisted by stubborn pastors and nuns . He was bereft of his Roman patrons with the death of Pius X and the eclipse of Pius X 's secretary of state , Merry del Val . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsuccessful from them ) of the secret marriage of his priest-nephew , whom he had improvidently made archdiocesan chancellor . None of these setbacks and disasters were topics for the press of the day , nor matters of gossip among the faithful he addressed by letter , nor exploited by other religious leaders outside his flock . Untroubled by defeat and unharassed by the media , he maintained the image of a strong , steady bulwark of Rome and sound morality . // Morality was his stock in trade , a stock that appealed as much to the majority of his Catholic audience as it did to many inheritors of the Puritan ethic . Distinct as they were in origin , education , imagination , methods , beliefs , and aspirations  --  so distinct that they make an incongruous pairing  --  O'Connell and Theodore Parker , Boston 's moral mentor of the 1850s , were linked by their focus on the moral side of religion . In chapter five , Parker 's free exercise of religion to influence the morals of the community is set out at length . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declared in an hour-long address at the Cathedral of the Holy Cross , marking in 1908 the centenary of Boston as a diocese of the Catholic Church . " The march to our duty here , not merely to ourselves , but to our surroundings , must proceed . God wills it . " God was still marching as in the 1850s , or directing the march ; moral progress and duty , the Parkerian watchwords of sixty years earlier , were still battle cries ; but a different trumpeter blew the trumpet . // O'Connell chose the issues on which he would commit himself and calibrated the degree of his commitment , with some care . Honesty in public office was one theme , superficially safe but practically fraught with danger if made particular and applied to individuals . Without pronouncement from the pulpit or circular letter to the parishes , he let be known his disapproval of James Michael Curley , the most prominent of rascals in Boston politics . In 1932 , the cardinal 's lawyer , Frederick Mansfield , defeated Curley for mayor of Boston and promptly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case the kind of corruption that Curley had been suspected of engaging in on a wide scale ; Curley was forced to disgorge his bribe . Yet Curley was irrepressible , and he went on to be governor : the cardinal was far from omnipotent. // A subsequent election year the cardinal observed in public , " The walls are raised against honest men in civic life . " On Tuesday , November 2 , 1937 , All Souls ' Day and Election Day in Boston , Curley was again on the ballot for mayor , opposed by a young newcomer , Maurice J. Tobin . Above its masthead that morning the Boston Post quoted the cardinal 's words about the walls raised against honesty and followed them with the newspaper 's own advice : " You can break down those walls by voting for an honest , clean , competent young man , Maurice J. Tobin today . He will redeem the city . " As was later remarked , " only the most careful reader " would have noticed where the quotation from O'Connell stopped . The cardinal took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resounding defeat is attributed , at least in part , to the Post 's proclamation . The method was more indirect than one that Parker would have used but the effect was one he would have applauded : a dishonest officeholder was denied reelection . // I was eleven at the time of this campaign and would lie if I said I recalled the Post headline ; but I do remember the cardinal 's general hostility to the old mayor . My parents shared the former 's deep antipathy to corrupt politicians , and as a rule of thumb in a state where Catholics were the largest bloc of voters , it was generally believed that a Catholic candidate for statewide office , running against a Protestant , would prevail , unless his honesty and competence fell signally below his opponent 's ; then , respect for governmental integrity would normally trump the fellow feeling of a once-oppressed minority that now could exercise political power . // Geographic , economic , ethnic , and political overlaps existed . The Catholics as immigrants or the children of immigrants tended to be urban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were farmers , or the suburbs and were doctors , lawyers , or real estate brokers ; conversely , there were poor Protestants , occasionally referred to in political jargon as " swamp Yankees . " The largest body of Catholics was of Irish descent ; but Italian , Portuguese , Polish , and French immigrants had also brought Catholicism with them , and there was a small number of converts . The majority were Democrats , but the Republicans had wooed the Italians and the rising Irish . There were odd pockets such as Quincy where John Quincy Adams 's grandson Thomas as a Democrat had turned the local Irish into Republicans . The stereotypical Catholic was urban , poor , Irish , and Democratic , with all factors reinforcing one another . Reality was more complex . Affected by , and affecting , all these forces , religion itself came in various shades , from the quiet fervor of the daily mass-goer to the disinterest of the fallen-aways. // To have combined all these disparate factors into a solid political bloc capable of action on a wide range of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Party on the model of the Center Party in Germany could not have been formed , if it had been wanted . And it was not wanted  --  not by the politicians , not by the church leaders . // Religion , nonetheless , remained a factor to be taken into account by politicians , analysts , and ordinary voters in Massachusetts elections . For one thing , in the 1930s it was still used as an index to ethnic identity . The William James family , to give a literary example , were of Irish descent but in this country had never been Catholic ; neither William nor Henry were looked on as Irish ; it startled me recently to hear the critic Denis Donoghue describe Henry as " Ireland 's second greatest novelist . " For another , the residue of political discrimination based on religion was just disappearing . It was a century since Catholics had been barred by law from public office . In the cities the Catholics had become dominant ; but it had taken a long time for any Catholic to achieve statewide office . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1914 , and he had gone on to become the first Catholic senator in 1922 . No Catholic sat on the Supreme Judicial Court until Walsh appointed James Bernard Carroll in 1915 ; there were none on the federal bench in Boston until George Sweeney in 1936 . If voters did take religion into account , this pattern of exclusion , not a clerical conspiracy , was a cause . Once all traces of discrimination disappeared  --  say by the 1950s  --  the cohesiveness of religion declined markedly . // O'Connell himself was conspicuous and explicit in saying that the Church endorsed no party . He had a friendly relation with only one president , William Howard Taft . He did nothing to forward the election of Al Smith , the first Catholic presidential candidate , for whom Massachusetts voted overwhelmingly . His relations with Franklin Delano Roosevelt , for whom Massachusetts was equally strong , were cool . He was suspected by militant Catholic Democrats of being a Republican . But he gave no public sign . // To return to his public stand on issues he saw as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to raise money for the state . The lottery bill , sponsored by Curley , was supposedly assured of passage . Opposition by newspapers and by Protestant church groups was unable to stop its inevitable success . The day before the final vote in the House , the cardinal publicly condemned the idea : lotteries were " a tremendous source of corruption and demoralization . " The next day the bill was defeated 187 to 40 . There is little question that the cardinal 's voice was decisive . // Besides corruption and the lottery , a third battle I was aware of as a boy  --  even more aware of because it brought sexuality into public discussion  --  was over birth control . In the 1870s , at the urging of the Protestant reformer Anthony Comstock , devices for preventing conception had been federally banned from the mails . Massachusetts had followed suit by forbidding their sale in the commonwealth . In 1941 a move to repeal the law was started in the legislature . Through his lawyer , Mansfield , O'Connell indicated his opposition . The sponsors , noting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tactics and introduced repeal by way of referendum to be voted on by the electorate at large . In November 1942. the issue was on the ballot  --  a moral issue if ever there was one , in Cardinal O'Connell 's eyes . Yet the subject of sex was not one he would speak on personally , nor did he care to describe contraception . Instead , the archdiocesan newspaper , The Pilot , thundered against " this unholy , unpatriotic , loathsome thing . " Voters were told not to permit " a practice which God Almighty has forbidden . " Pastors were encouraged to enroll voters and themselves to speak out in general terms against the initiative . I still have a clear memory of riding by car from Boston to Worcester in October 1942 , seeing the highway at various strategic places carrying billboards with the stark and simple message : BIRTH CONTROL IS AGAINST GOD 'S LAW . VOTE NO ON PROPOSITION TWO . I could n't vote , but I could ask questions , and I did ask why . The answer  --  the orthodox one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is it wrong to cut your fingernails , then ? " I asked . The analogy was far from perfect but was enough to make me think that the message could be wrong . // The cardinal did not lose that time on that one . But as he could effect nothing by force , and as such old-fashioned ecclesiastical methods as interdicts were out of style , he could succeed only if his views tapped a fund of moral sentiment already present in his audience . He occasionally lost , not only in his battles with Curley . At the explicit request of Cardinal Gasparri , Pius XI 's secretary of state , he wrote Governor Fuller asking clemency for Sacco and Vanzetti and was rebuffed . Following his own sense of propriety , he rebuked ( by category , not name , the same method used in his treatment of Curley ) the demagogic Detroit priest Charles Coughlin : " Almost hysterical addresses by ecclesiastics " were out of place in political discourse . Catholic Boston remained Coughlinist in sympathy . Even where the welfare of churchly charities was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitutional convention in 1917 considered a ban on state aid to sectarian institutions , including schools and hospitals . The proposal went exactly contrary to the old Protestant constitution 's aid to the clergy and to Harvard . The former had been ended in 1833 , and Harvard had not received appropriated funds since the 1840s ; but other Protestant agencies had been subsidized . Sentiment to end state aid seemed to coincide with fear that Catholic entities would benefit . So at least O'Connell thought , declaring publicly : " even before we have a chance to speak , the door is slammed in our face . " Despite the cardinal 's admonitions , the amendment was supported by Boston Catholic politicians such as Martin Lomasney , the boss of the West End , and John McCormack , the future congressman and Speaker of the House ; the convention adopted it ; and the voters approved it overwhelmingly . // As Lomasney , McCormack , and Curley illustrated , the Catholic politicians were not all in the cardinal 's camp . Even the one political figure he regarded as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . O'Connell 's reserve was in sharp contrast to Parker 's interventions with Senator Charles Sumner , and O'Connell 's maneuvering against Curley bears little comparison with Parker 's denunciation of Senator Daniel Webster . In general , O'Connell can be fitted into one Tocquevillian insight  --  religion embodied in him operated as the foremost of American political institutions because it played no party game but sought to advance what its advocate saw as common morality . // Growing up in this environment where Catholicism embodied moral energy  --  an energy that reinforced that of my parents  --  I did not take much interest in the dogmatic disputes of earlier centuries , and the implications of modern biblical criticism had not been absorbed by the Catholic mainstream . The Bible came in the regular readings of the gospels at mass , where the biblical text became part of the liturgy and enjoyed the liturgy 's sense of being outside time ; it was not history . My first recollection of the Bible outside this confining liturgical context is of reading at about age nine a set of " Bible stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacrifice of his son I found a terrifying tale . Earlier , say when I was about seven , my mother had told me the story of Adam , Eve , and the snake , and I had asked , " In what language did the snake talk ? "  --  a scientific rather than skeptical question . My first flash of real doubt occurred at Christmas when I was eleven or twelve : the whole story of Bethlehem struck me as improbable because of the detail . It was the same sensation I was to have later reading Paradise Lost : Milton 's thick embroidery made the whole business fantasy . The accounts provided by Matthew and Luke , now styled " the Infancy Narratives , " were to be analyzed in Raymond Brown 's The Birth of the Messiah as largely midrashim , stories composed to convey a theological insight . But Brown 's book came half a century later . Such freedom from literalism in reading the New Testament was uncontemplated in my education . In the case of Christmas I suppressed my thoughts . Religion in relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education was completed at the Cenacle  --  first by kind sisters ( I did not encounter the surly nuns of legend ) , then by a brilliant young priest , John Wright , later a cardinal and the lost hope of the American liberals ( to be specific , he did not go to bat for them on the subject of contraception and similar issues ) . Besides the parish in Brookline of St. Lawrence , named for a saint renowned for being grilled , there was the Jesuit church of St. Ignatius , the chapel of Boston College ; the Passionist monastery of St. Gabriel in Brighton ; and the Franciscan friary in Brookline . As in Chaucer 's day , the Franciscans were favorites as confessors . The religious range within Catholicism was rich enough to accommodate a variety of inclinations , moods , needs , and intellectual interests . // The Protestant clergy was unknown to me , but the Protestant approach was familiar . Public school in Brookline opened class daily with a prayer  --  the Our Father and the Twenty-third Psalm . The Our Father was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the power and the glory . " As the Catholic form was the first prayer I knew , I was aware of the difference , and soon  --  I am not sure how soon  --  learned the reason for it and would be silent when the apocryphal addition was prayed . No teacher commented . Nor did any student or parent object to the prayers . The John D. Runkle School  --  later jocularly called " the Jewish Groton "  --  had then a mixed **26;176;TOOLONG clientele . // After four years at Runkle I attended the Rivers Country Day School for eight . Here the headmaster , Clarence Allen , began each week with a school assembly , at which he prayed and Protestant hymns were sung . There was a vestigial sense about this short weekly service , less frequent than our public school prayers , a faint remainder of the robust religious rites of High Church boarding schools . It was a tincture of religion . Nonetheless , I enjoyed the hymns , and some of their stirring stanzas still echo in my brain . I had of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them , so far as I could tell , particularly religious or interested in religion . As usual , an exception to such a generalization comes to mind : my Rivers classmate , Arthur Chute McGill , who later became a professor at Harvard Divinity School . But at Rivers I thought of Arthur as my chief academic rival , doubly formidable because his uncle , Austin Chute , was our Latin teacher . Protestants outnumbered Catholics on the faculty and in the student body , but religious discrimination was not known . // One final note on the Protestant heritage , a note moving from the explicitly religious to cultural history , but of relevance to the theme of this book : in the study of history and in general conversation the Salem witch trials were sometimes referred to , perhaps partly because witches were a topic for merriment at Halloween and partly because we would visit our Shea relatives in Salem , the site of the trials . But no one ever mentioned that in the nineteenth century Unitarians had dispossessed Congregationalists ; that in the eighteenth century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congregationalists had beaten Baptists and killed Quakers . Nineteenth-century New Englanders had tried to keep alive the memory of the persecution of the Quakers . Nathaniel Hawthorne ; descendant of one persecutor , memorialized the horror of it in 1832 in " The Gentle Boy , " an early tale as haunting and guilt-ridden as vintage Hawthorne . John Greenleaf Whittier , himself a Quaker , put to verse the ordeal of the Southwick children . Brooks Adams , John Adams 's great-grandson , in a book polemically entitled The Emancipation of Massachusetts , ascribed to " the Quaker martyrs " " our own perfect liberty of thought and speech . " These efforts to preserve the cautionary legacy were in vain . That part of the Protestant past was swallowed up by a picture of Protestant amity and tolerance , a united Protestant front . // Because of the war , I left Rivers early , in January 1944 , to follow my father 's footsteps to Harvard . No alternative was considered by me or my parents ; not even the hint of a Catholic college was heard from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1944 I plunged into the study of the New England Transcendentalists with F. O. Matthiessen as mentor . Emerson 's Divinity School Address of 1836 made an immediate impression . But how far that seemed from the moribund Divinity School of the Harvard of my day ! In similar ways religious themes ran through many of the courses I then took in English , although the religious as such was not isolated from the cultural and not often emphasized . Matthiessen was an exception , and I think of him reading " Ash Wednesday " as though trying to understand and empathize with T. S. Eliot 's religious preoccupation . Eliot , at all events , stood as the best of American poets and was indubitably religious . // The finest of teachers outside the English department was Joseph Schumpeter , the former finance minister of Austria . ( Another ex. was Heinrich Mining , the Center Party leader and former German chancellor whom Hitler had pushed aside ; I met him in Lowell House but did not know him well enough to learn from him ) . Schumpeter was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Socialism from him . He thought that as an economic system socialism could work . I asked him why anyone would want it if it was not in the interest of their class . He answered , " Some men pursue women , some religion , some hunting . " In his view socialism was a species of religion and was as arbitrarily and as personally chosen . He himself was reported to prefer the pursuit of women ; but we gossiped remarkably little about our professors . // My tutor was Jack Bate , then known to me as Assistant Professor W. Jackson Bate . With him I read Boswell on Dr. Johnson and was immediately captured by the great moralist . Encouraged by Bate , I embarked on a senior thesis comparing Johnson and Harvard 's humanist , Irving Babbitt ; my theme was the place of " absolute values " in the work of a critic , and I compared Johnson 's Christian beliefs favorably with Babbitt 's more tentative foundations . Harry Levin took an interest in this thesis , too , and I benefited from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philosophy , but on my own read The Unity of Philosophical Experience , the William James lectures given at Harvard by Etienne Gilson , a marvel of synopsis and simplification . I read some Newman , some Maritain , and was above all affected by a philosophical novel , George Santayana 's The Last Puritan . Set in part in Boston , with a stifling Puritan legacy contrasted with a vital Catholic current and both set off against pagan unbelief , the work exhibited Santayana 's clear grasp of the alternatives ; the next year I was to visit him in Rome . // With wartime acceleration , I graduated at the end of the summer of 1946 , just as the war ended , and I had a sense that my college education had been too short and that I should continue it . Thanks to my parents ' generosity , I did so at St. John 's College , Cambridge University . In Europe I saw for the first time what a Christian culture had created , from universities like Cambridge to cathedrals like Siena 's . For a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for tourists , but still sacred places . I visited Lourdes , no great cathedral city , but a place where the palpable miracle was the faith of pilgrims , spiritually exalted whether they were bettered physically or not . I visited Rome and , through Cardinal Spellman and his friend Count Galeazzi , met Pius XII . Our conversation was not memorable , but my impression of the pope 's intelligence remains . I visited the ancient church of San Clemente , built on a shrine to Mithras , and in its bowels encountered a Roman bust of Cardinal O'Connell , who had paid for the restoration . With Santayana I spoke at length , as also with Eliot in his office at Faber &amp; Faber ; I was struck by the photograph of Pius XII he had on his London desk . // The European experience cumulatively confirmed what I already felt in my bones , that Catholicism was the largest intellectual force in my life , yet I knew so little about it . I had never studied it as a subject . My religious education , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school level . It seemed to me absurd to place such confidence in what I had examined so little . I took the advice of the chairman of the Harvard English department , George Sherburn . After consultation with his colleagues he recommended either the Pontifical Institute of Medieval Studies at Toronto University or the Catholic University of America in Washington . Toronto looked like a cold place , Washington one that presented political vistas as well as academic ones . I chose Washington . // My plan was to obtain a doctorate in philosophy , but first it was necessary to know enough philosophy to enter the Graduate School of Philosophy . The first year I pursued a private tutorial with Vincent Smith , one of the few persons I have known who had a pure philosophical mind , that is , who had internalized philosophical concepts as though they actually contained insights into reality . It was a pleasure to read and debate Thomas Aquinas with him . At the same time I studied Church History with Alfred Rush , Scripture with Edward Arbez , Apologetics with Edmund Benard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid for his work . The other three were priests and insisted that their tutorial efforts could not be compensated . I became friends with Arbez , an exile from France after the suppression of Modernism and an excellent Scripture scholar , too cautious one would say today , but fully aware of all modern methods of investigating the ancient texts . Benard was only a dozen years my senior , an expert on Newman , a pure Gallic intelligence from the diocese of Springfield , Massachusetts . With him and his Paulist colleague Eugene Burke I became a dinner companion , golfing companion , and traveling companion . Our debates were unending . // Of these debates the most relevant here ( I see I have strayed into matters not strictly germane but perhaps they are excusable as context ) was over the relation of religion to governmental power . In June 1948 the Catholic Theological Society met in Chicago . The society was only three years old . It was about to elect Burke its president . " Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graduate of Boston College and professor of theology at the Jesuit seminary at Woodstock for the past eleven years , presented a seventy-page paper entitled " Governmental Repression of Heresy , " a subject which he accurately identified as " the neuralgic point on a contemporary controversy . " He contended that it was not the duty of a good Catholic state to repress heresy even when it was practicable to do so . // All the modern theological text writers were against him  --  the Dominican Louis Bender ; the curialist Alfredo Ottaviani ; a variety of French , German , Italian , and Spanish Jesuits . In the United States the leading authority on " Catholic principles of politics , " Monsignor John A. Ryan "  --  Right Reverend New Dealer , " the liberal theological supporter of Franklin Delano Roosevelt  --  had studied the papal encyclical Mirari vos and taken specific note of its condemnation of " the doctrine of liberty of conscience and separation of Church and State . " As recently as 1941 Ryan had published this pronouncement : " If there is only one true religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in life for States as well as individuals , then the public profession , protection and promotion of this religion , and the legal prohibition of all direct assaults upon it , becomes one of the most obvious and fundamental duties of the State . " From this principle Ryan drew the conclusion that in an ideal state the Catholic Church would be established and heresy would be repressed . // The unanimity of the theologians was no accident . They were united because they followed what Gregory XVI had taught in Mirari vos , what Pius IX , following Gregory XVI , had taught in Quanta cura , what Leo XIII in the wake of his predecessors had proclaimed in Immortale Dei . In Mirari vos Gregory XVI had responded to the efforts of Felicite de Lamennais to make the Church a champion of religious liberty . The pope assailed " indifferentism , " described as the doctrine that anyone could obtain eternal salvation , whatever his beliefs , provided that he lived a decent moral life . " From this most foul font of indifferentism , " Gregory XVI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or , rather , madness , that freedom of conscience must be affirmed and defended for everyone . " In Quanta cura Pius IX repeated Gregory XVI 's attack on " the madness that freedom of conscience and of worship is the proper right of every human being and ought to be proclaimed by law and maintained in every rightly-constituted society . " These teachings were dated respectively on the Feast of the Assumption , 1832 , and the Feast of the Immaculate Conception , 1864 , giving a Marian cachet to what were sent as encyclical letters to all the bishops of the Catholic Church . Their teaching was endorsed again in 1885 by Leo XIII in Immortale Dei , an encyclical explicitly focused upon " the Christian constitution of States . " // These pronouncements , as a reading of the next chapter will confirm , were consistent with Catholic teaching since St. Augustine on the coercion of heretics . They were , however , notably one-sided in ignoring Catholic teaching since Lactantius on the rights of conscience and the Catholic teaching incorporated in St. Thomas Aquinas on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former Camaldolese monk , and Pius IX , a disillusioned liberal , spoke with excited anxiety and anger as they contemplated the social ruin they thought freedom of conscience and freedom of opinion had brought to France and the Papal States . Read outside the broader context of Christian teaching , the encyclicals stood like boulders barring recognition of the universal freedom of conscience . // Encyclicals are known from their opening words . Mirari vos ( You have wondered ) and Quanta cura ( With what great care ) resonated in my ears . I had wondered . The Church , with great care , had apparently answered . Small wonder that the Redemptorist Francis Connell , then Catholic America 's best known moral theologian , announced at Chicago after hearing Murray , " I , for one , shall continue to uphold the traditional view . " The furthest that orthodox theologians would go in glossing the papal position was to advocate a theory , daring when first conceived , that there was a thesis and an hypothesis . The thesis was that a Catholic state had a duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some circumstances , more harm than good might be done by a state doing its duty . In these hypothetical circumstances , religious toleration became the duty . In the United States , for example , it was generally agreed that the circumstances of the hypothetical held . Catholics could and should accept and extend religious freedom ; but in principle , religious repression was the state 's responsibility . Naturally , this view that in ideal circumstances the Catholics would repress all other beliefs caused uneasiness . The unrest was skillfully played on by Protestant polemicists like Paul Blanshard . Critics of this character were guilty of being more Catholic than the pope  --  of taking the authoritative texts more literally than they were taken in the Catholic Church in America or Rome ; but the critics ' distrust was genuine and the doctrine they exploited had once been operative . // What Murray did in defense and development of his idea was to cultivate an understanding of the difference between state and society ; to critique the church-state theory of St. Robert Bellarmine ; to invoke ideas on " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fourteenth-century theologian Jean Quidort ( Sleeping John ) ; and to suggest that the nineteenth-century encyclicals be read in context as polemics against a rationalism , a naturalism , and a Latin anticlericalism very different from the philosophy behind the American separation of church and state . He appealed as well to European history : " Political experience has taught us that the worst way to cope with dissidence is by legal suppression of it . Experience too has , I think , taught the Church that any attempt to establish or maintain religious unity by governmental coercion of dissenters does more harm than good to the Church . " // Murray was answered not by experience but by appeal to authoritative doctrine . His scholarly articles , his tentative attempts to establish historical contexts , were replied to by firm insistence on the black letter of the papal texts . At Catholic University , Murray 's fierce opponent was Joseph Fenton , a diocesan priest from Springfield , Massachusetts , and Benard and Burke 's colleague on the theological faculty . " Butch " Fenton , a bear of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holy Office in Rome and to delate Benard and Burke as well if they were in Murray 's camp . // I entered debate with my two friends , taking Fenton 's position , as I had with my father , and teasing them for their sole authority , Sleeping John . I did so with a double motive . On the one hand , I thought Fenton had all history on his side , so that there was intellectual integrity in sticking to his position . On the other hand , I thought that if Fenton was right , the Church must be wrong to have such a position . And remember that my general posture was that of an investigator of the foundation of faith . Could I believe in a Church so firmly attached to a doctrine my own father thought was ridiculous ? // Finally tiring of my endless citation of papal pronouncements against religious freedom , Benard and Burke suggested I travel the short distance to Woodstock , Maryland and confront Murray himself . It was arranged . We spent the afternoon together . Murray stated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " The papal encyclicals must be seen in context . They spoke against the background of an anticlerical politics . They did not speak for all time . " I saw what he meant ; but I did not see how this background fully explained Gregory XVI 's vehement denunciation in Mirari vos of the ideas of Felicite de Lamennais . Lamennais was not only the foremost apologist of the Church in France ; he was , in contrast to the Gallican tradition , outspokenly propapal . In the early 1830s his paper L'Avenir had taught that the future lay with democracy and the Church . I did not understand how Murray 's global explanation of the papal condemnation fitted his case . I felt the attraction of Murray 's position without being persuaded of it . I put the question aside as not a practical one : after all , every Catholic accepted American democracy and liberty of religion today . But in the back of my mind I was aware that this practical comfort implicated a much larger question , the relation of history to the teaching of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again and again . // Meanwhile I found in the Graduate School of Philosophy the academic context in which to pursue my examination of the claims and credentials of the Catholic Church . My master 's thesis was on Alfred Loisy . Loisy , a French priest and biblical scholar , had found it impossible to reconcile the results of modern biblical scholarship with traditional presentations of the Gospel . In L'Evangile et l'Eglise he ventured on a theory of the development of Church teaching that explained a dogmatic change as a response to changing human needs . His views were rejected by Pius X and condemned in the encyclical Pascendi where his approach , stigmatized as Modernism , was characterized as " the synthesis of all the heresies . " It was such a synthesis because it provided for indefinite , ecclesiastically uncontrolled development of doctrine . I could see , I could feel the attraction of Loisy 's position . Was it not what John Courtney Murray was arguing in explaining the change on church and state ? But I also could see the strength of the papal position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did revelation have ? Was there no principle of stability ? // I determined to look at the questions in terms of the philosophical postulates , explicit or implicit , in Loisy 's work . My essay did not take enough account of the biblical data that had stimulated Loisy 's solution , nor enough account of the theological dimensions ; it did link Loisy to a chain of European subjectivism into which his speculations fitted ; but my work was more an exercise than an enterprise wholly engaging me . It was different with my doctoral dissertation , into which I immediately plunged . The topic was the scholastic analysis of usury , that is , the way the Catholic theologians and canonists had presented the Church 's prohibition of profit on a loan . The subject looked dusty to the outside observer . To me it had a triple appeal : its matter was moral , specifically , the demands of justice ; the reasoning of the scholastic writers , while nominally philosophical , was very often legal , and already I was contemplating law school , to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I was studying was the evolution of a moral doctrine . That evolution challenged the Church 's claim of constancy in its teaching .
