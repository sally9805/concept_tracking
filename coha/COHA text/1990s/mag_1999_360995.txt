Got Zippergate burnout ? Then read  --  in fact , buy  --  this brisk , witty , cheerfully dour screed by Shearer , the radio host ( Le Show ) , protean voice ( The Simpsons ) and hidden national treasure of political common sense . Analyzing the hatred some people have for Clinton , Shearer ladles blame and caustic wit on the President , his G.O.P. posse and the moralizing TV newsies with their " hideously bad acting . " It 's a smart challenge to lazy thinking . Along with another acerb little volume , Gore Vidal 's The American Presidency , it can be taken as an ideal chaser to the recent binge of Monicaholism . Hemlock , anyone ? <P>  --  By Richard Corliss
