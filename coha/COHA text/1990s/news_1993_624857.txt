<p> WASHINGTON  --  Why leave balkanization to the Balkans ? <p> With none of the gunfire but hardly less fervor than in the former Yugoslavia , disaffected pieces of states in America are clamoring to break away . <p> More taxes , fewer services and , some believe , cultural differences fed by racial and ethnic prejudice are prompting talk in more and more states about splitting up . <p> Such movements have come and gone throughout the nation 's history , but the latest round of domestic geopolitical unrest has a new touch of urgency , if not reality . Advocates profess not to be daunted by the formidable roadblocks to rearranging the national map  --  including procedural , financial and political hurdles . <p> The latest itch comes in California , where a legislative committee last week sent forward a bill calling for a 1994 referendum on carving the Golden State into three pieces . <p> " " California is clinically depressed and totally dysfunctional " in its present configuration , argued the measure 's sponsor , Assemblyman Stan Statham , a Republican from relatively bucolic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the mean streets of Los Angeles . <p> The only way to ensure better government , he contends , is to provide new , separate governments  --  plural . <p> Statham 's move follows similar rumblings in New York , Florida , Michigan , Illinois , Kansas , Kentucky and other states , including , of course , Texas . <p> Two years ago , Republican Rep. David Swinford of Dumas introduced a bill to spin off the Panhandle as a separate state . At heart , Swinford conceded recently , the measure was a protest , to highlight the contention that his constituents send $ 26 in taxes to Austin for every $ 1 worth of state services they get back . <p> Legislators chuckled over the proposal and went back to whatever else they were doing , Swinford recalled . " " It died a slow and painful death . " <p> But his bill represented a feeling that echoes around the country . Separatists from a section of western Illinois , arguing they were bereft of political power and perks , dubbed their region " " Forgottonia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least in a present-day context . <p> " " If you were drawing a map of political cultures or regional cultures , you would n't use state boundary lines , " observed Stanley Brunn , a University of Kentucky geographer who follows break-away movements . <p> But the state lines are there , and rarely have been changed . <p> Only three times have states been carved directly out of other states : Kentucky ( 1792 ) and West Virginia ( 1863 ) from Virginia and Maine ( 1820 ) from Massachusetts . <p> " " There 's absolutely nothing in the whole realm of geography that 's harder to change than a political boundary , " said Peirce Lewis of Pennsylvania State University . " " Cast your mind back over the last century . There is no major war that was n't fought initially over a political boundary . " <p> In California alone , there have been more than two dozen attempts at fission , beginning even before the state 's admission to the union in 1850 . In 1859 , the legislature asked residents of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new state . You bet , replied the scattered rancheros , who were uninterested in helping to finance the cosmopolitan leanings of then-dominant San Francisco . <p> But , as historian Kevin Starr points out , the Civil War was approaching , and Congress , which under the Constitution must approve new admissions , never acted on the proposal . The new state was to have been called Colorado , which was recycled for a later entrant ( 1876 ) . <p> Some suggest that , because of the 1845 agreement taking the Republic of Texas into the United States , the Legislature could divide the current state into as many as five new states without congressional assent . <p> Congressional sign-off on any of the current moves toward break-away states is problematic . Political considerations might weigh heavily . The move to grant statehood or even just congressional voting rights to the District of Columbia is opposed by Republicans because the entire new delegation  --  two senators and a House member  --  would almost certainly be Democrats . <p> The partisan cast of three new Californias is not a given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be fickle . The election of a Republican as mayor of heavily Democratic Los Angeles last week is but one example of independence that gives political operatives the willies when working in the nation 's most populous state . <p> The current move toward division in California attracts attention because it is often in the vanguard of political movements , including the tax-limitation amendment of 1978 , oft-imitated Proposition 13 . <p> " " People look to California as a harbinger of this kind of thing , " observed geographer Brunn . " " California is a pacesetter . " <p> " " That 's true , " said Lewis , who has lived in the state off and on during his career . " " But California is also the scene for maximum silliness . " <p> Assemblyman Statham contends he is serious , but others detect a bit of mischief designed to play to constituents who have already expressed a strong sentiment for leaving the southern part of the state behind . Last year , in a non-binding referendum , 27 Northern California counties voted to go it alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , was rejected in some populous bay-area counties , including San Francisco . <p> Statham 's proposal is serious enough that he includes guarantees to soothe fears that would accompany a split . Foremost is protection of the existing water rights and contracts , which keep the arid Los Angeles basin and bone-dry Central Valley awash in snowmelt from the north . <p> Also guaranteed in each of the three new states would be current per-pupil school spending , in-state tuition at all public colleges , current professional licenses and public retirement funds . <p> Statham 's bill faces not only a full debate in the Assembly but an uncertain future in the Senate and , should it finally pass , in the office of Gov . Pete Wilson , a Republican who might allow a popular vote on the measure but is opposed to splitting the state . <p> " " All my bill does is look for public opinion , " Statham said . " " I 'm going to the people because that is the only way this will be taken seriously . " <p> So far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the answer to their gripes about the state 's declining conditions . <p> Polls show the proposed California split a big loser . <p> California split <p> A California state assemblyman , supported by a straw poll in which 27 of 31 counties polled opted for dividing the state , has proposed a three-way split . Under the proposal , California would be split into three states , roughly equal in area but with far different populations and projected state budgets . <p> NORTH CALIFORNIA <p> Population : 2.3 million . <p> Budget : $ 3.6 billion . <p> Counties : Alpine , Amador , Butte , Calaveras , Colusa , Del Norte , El Dorado , Glenn , Humboldt , Lake , Lassen , Marin , Mendocino , Modoc , Napa , Nevada , Placer , Plumas , Shasta , Sierra , Siskiyou , Sonoma , Sutter , Tehama , Trinity , Tuolumne , Yolo , Yuba . <p> CENTRAL CALIFORNIA <p> Population : 1000 million . <p> Budget : $ 15 billion . <p> Counties : Alameda , Contra Costa , Fresno , Inyo , Kern , Kings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sacramento , San Benito , San Francisco , San Joaquin , San Luis Obisbo , San Mateo , Santa Clara , Santa Cruz , Solano , Stanislaus , Tulare . <p> SOUTH CALIFORNIA <p> Population : 18 million . <p> Budget : $ 27 billion . <p> Counties : Imperial , Los Angeles , Orange , Riverside , San Diego , San Bernadino , Santa Barbara , Ventura.
