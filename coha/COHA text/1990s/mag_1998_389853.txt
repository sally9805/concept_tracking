New dietary ammo against diabetes ? <p> Non-insulin-dependent diabetes is epidemic in the United States . The potentially deadly disorder afflicts some 16 million people in this country , accounting for 95 percent of all diabetes . The number of people with non-insulin-dependent diabetes is 50 percent greater today than it was just a decade ago . Cardiovascular complications account for half of all deaths among people with this type of diabetes , commonly called type 2 , and the disorder is the leading cause of kidney failure , adult blindness , and amputations in the United States . Nationally , medical expenditures associated with treating type 2 diabetes and its complications are about $92 billion per year . <p> The disease arises when people lose all or part of their sensitivity to insulin , the hormone that normally signals cells to move glucose from the blood into energy-hungry tissues . Because spikes in blood-glucose concentrations can damage the circulatory system and other organs , the long-term health of people With full-blown type 2 diabetes depends upon how tightly they can control their blood sugar concentrations . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regularly , losing weight , and choosing certain foods . <p> People considered to be prediabetic because they have faltering blood sugar control also fare better in the long run if they follow the same lifestyle guidelines . <p> Restricting intake of sugar and starches is one way that people can maintain moderate blood sugar concentrations . Their diet should include primarily fibrous whole grains that release glucose slowly into the bloodstream ( SN : 4/8/00 , p. 236 ) . That 's a tough challenge in today 's fast-food world , dominated by refined , highly processed foods . <p> However , an assortment of new nutrition data may come as unexpectedly sweet news . Researchers are uncovering mechanisms by which a range of dietary agents  --  including coffee , wine , and cinnamon  --  appear to restore some of the body 's responsiveness to insulin and control of blood sugar . Such changes seem to be transitory , however , so these foods offer no cure for diabetes . But dietary scientists now suggest that regular intake of these foods might slow the disease 's onset and reduce its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antidiabetic effects of coffee . The March 10 Journal of the American Medical Association carries the latest epidemiological evidence  --  two European studies showing that people who drink 6 to 10 cups of coffee , primarily caffeinated , per day tend to develop type 2 diabetes at lower rates than individuals do who drink 2 or fewer cups a day . <p> For several years , scientists have been asking what constituent of java works to control blood sugar . Gradually , chlorogenic acids , a relatively minor family of chemicals in coffee beans , have emerged as prime candidates . <p> Much attention focused on caffeine , which has turned out to have a detrimental effect . Terry E. Graham of the University of Guelph in Ontario and his coworkers recently tested tie effect of pure caffeine , caffeinated coffee , and decaf on blood sugar in lean and obese people with and without type 2 diabetes . The amount of caffeine in a mug or two of strong coffee was sufficient to disrupt control of blood sugar for several hours in any of those 67 individuals , says Graham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out soon in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition . <p> Giving the volunteers caffeine in plain water followed an hour later by a slug of sugar water induced the highest blood sugar concentrations . The same amount of caffeine delivered in 2 cups of coffee before the sugar jolt raised blood sugar concentrations about 75 percent as much as the pure caffeine did . However , when the researchers gave people two cups of decaffeinated coffee and then the sugar , their blood sugar concentrations were even lower than when they drank plain water before the sugar . <p> That result suggests that the decaf  --  and , therefore , some coffee component other than caffeine  --  has an antidiabetic effect , says Graham . <p> Last year , Linda M. Morgan and her colleagues at the University of Surrey in England tested nine healthy volunteers . Each made three morning visits to Morgan 's lab after fasting overnight . In the lab , they each downed 25 grains of sugar in 2 cups of a beverage . On one morning , they took the sugar in regular coffee ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in water . After each sugary drink , they submitted to tests of how much ingested glucose entered their blood during the next 3 hours . <p> Both coffee types enabled the volunteers to control blood glucose significantly better than they did after drinking the glucose-containing water , the scientists reported in the October 2003 American Journal of Clinical Nutrition . Once in the blood , however , glucose that was drunk with caffeinated coffee tended to stay there , as it would in a person with diabetes . The finding is consistent with other studies showing that caffeine can impair insulin 's responsiveness to blood sugar . <p> By keeping the concentrations of chlorogenic acids the same in the decaf and caffeinated coffees , the researchers made sure that those compounds were n't the source of the effect . Earlier studies by the group had shown that low concentrations of chlorogenic acids naturally present in apples attenuated the release of glucose into the blood after volunteers ate the fruit . <p> Michael N. Clifford , the research team 's food chemist , hypothesizes that chlorogenic acids , which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reduce the efficiency of molecular-scale pumps that move glucose across the walls of cells lining the digestive tract . These acids would thereby tend to keep sugar in the gut and out of the bloodstream , reducing the chances of the high spikes of blood sugar that exacerbate diabetes . <p> Jane Shearer of Vanderbilt University in Nashville and her colleagues have studied the effects of pure chlorogenic acids , isolated from decaf , on enzymes that regulate the liver s release of glucose . Ordinarily , between meals , the liver sends glucose into the blood to keep it available to tissues . In people with diabetes , the liver inappropriately sends out glucose even after a meal has already boosted blood concentrations of the sugar , <p> The researchers showed in rats that chlorogenic acids disrupt the liver enzymes ' action , bogging down glucose 's release into the blood . This helps prevent blood sugar spikes after meals , the researchers reported in the November 2003 Journal of Nutrition . <p> TEA TOO ? A few studies have hinted that teas  --  with their bounty of antioxidants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latest such trial , Lucy S. Hwang of National Taiwan University in Taipei measured green tea 's effect on insulin action in rats with experimentally induced diabetes . <p> Hwang 's team substituted room-temperature tea for drinking water for half of the animals . After 12 weeks , tea-drinking rodents exhibited improved insulin sensitivity and lower blood-glucose concentrations during the 2 hours after each meal , the researchers reported in the Feb. 1 Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry . <p> In related test-tube studies , the group measured how well fat cells from these animals absorb glucose , an action that in the body would lower blood sugar concentrations . The cells from diabetic rats drinking green tea absorbed more than twice as much of the sugar as did cells from similar animals drinking plain water  --  indicating , the researchers say , that the tea had indeed improved the fat cells ' insulin sensitivity . <p> Hwang 's group has now tested other types of tea . All true teas are made from leaves from the same species of plant . Greet tea is unfermented , whereas black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like the green tea in the original test , semifermented pouchong tea " significantly increased glucose uptake " by fat ells taken from diabetic animals that drank it , Hwang told Science News . However , fully fermented black tea  --  the favorite of most Western tea drinkers  --  did n't affect glucose absorption . <p> Since different teas contain different polyphenols that might underlie the fat-cell response , Hwang 's team tested the antidiabetic effects of several polyphenols from the best-performing teas . The most effective turned out to be epigallocatechin gallate , an agent known to have anticancer properties ( SN : 7/23/94 , p. 61 ) . In her lab tests , the compound has " insulinlike activity , " Hwang says . <p> Hwang 's team has traced the green tea 's antidiabetic attributes to other mechanisms as well . In rats , green tea increased the number of insulin receptors on cells and the blood concentration of a protein  --  GLUT-IV  --  that helps move glucose out of the blood and into cells . Moreover , Hwang notes , the tea activated insulin-receptor kinase , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initiate activity . <p> SPICE IT DOWN Scientists at the Agriculture Department 's Beltsville ( Md . ) Human Nutrition Research Center have been studying how chromium , which is found in black pepper and some other foods , also boosts the activity of insulin-receptor kinase and related enzymes . Experiments beginning almost a half-century ago showed that chromium supplements can restore blood sugar control to some people and animals with diabetes . The question has been why that is and what might represent effective doses of chromium . <p> Recent studies have shown that the element chemically alters the cell-surface receptors to which insulin attaches , explains Beltsville chemist Richard A , Anderson . Without chromium , insulin ca n't dock at the receptors and shepherd glucose from the blood into energy-hungry cells . <p> When the hormone 's job is done , another enzyme switches off the insulin receptor . Chromium also inhibits the shut-off enzyme 's action , Anderson says . The element offers dual benefits . <p> Unfortunately , Anderson observes , the modern diet of highly processed foods is low in chromium . What 's more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chromium . <p> The formulation of currently available chromium supplements does n't permit the body to absorb the element efficiently , Anderson says . However , his team has just received a patent for a new formulation , called chromium histidine , that in human trials results in absorption of about 50 percent more chromium than conventional supplements do , he says . <p> It was during tests of the new chromium supplement that Anderson and his colleagues stumbled onto an entirely different antidiabetes substance in , of all things , apple pie . During the early stages of one study , the researchers were attempting to disrupt some volunteers ' blood sugar control by feeding them a low chromium diet that included pie . Surprisingly , these volunteers ' blood sugar remained under control . Subsequent test-tube studies showed that cinnamon in the pie was boosting insulin activity , as chromium does , and thus controlling blood glucose . The spice turned out to be the " best thing we ever tested " for that purpose , Anderson says . <p> Anderson and his colleagues recently studied 60 people with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ containing either cinnamon or wheat flour . The 30 people getting daily doses of l , 3 , or 6 grams of cinnamon for 40 days experienced an 18 to 29 percent drop in blood glucose , compared with their values at the beginning of the study . A gram of cinnamon is about one-half a teaspoon , says Anderson . Volunteers getting wheat flour for 40 days showed no such benefit . <p> Cinnamon also improved Study participants ' blood-cholesterol and triglycerides concentrations , Anderson 's team reported in the December 2003 Diabetes Care . <p> Subsequently , the scientists found that cinnamons active ingredients are polyphenol polymers with insulinlike action . Anderson 's team described those experiments in the Jan. 14 Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry . <p> Cloves , bay leaves , and other spices show enzymatic effects similar to those of cinnamon , Anderson has found , though none approaches cinnamons potency . <p> WINE SURPRISE If spices and coffee can help control blood sugar , why not wine ? After all , studies have suggested that the alcohol and polyphenols that the beverage contains reduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SN : 7/24/99 , p. 52 ) . These chemicals might act by increasing cells ' insulin sensitivity , reasoned wine biochemist Pierre-Louis Teissdre of the University of Montpellier in France . <p> Teissdre 's team separated wine 's antioxidant polyphenols from its alcohol . Diabetic mice fed one or the other type of ingredient showed complementary benefits , the scientists reported in the Feb. 15 Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry . <p> For 6 weeks , animals consumed alcohol , polyphenols , both , or neither . The maximum dose was the equivalent , taking body weight into account , of the amount that a person imbibes in three glasses of wine per day . Diabetic animals getting both alcohol and polyphenols controlled their blood sugar after a meal about as well as normal mice did . Mice getting alcohol did n't do quite as well but still had better blood sugar control than did animals getting either the polyphenols only or neither wine ingredient . <p> The wine components also affected the retarded growth associated with severe diabetes , which prevents cells from accessing the fuel they need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting both types of wine ingredients or only alcohol grew larger than did the animals receiving polyphenols only or no wine component . <p> When receiving both types of wine ingredients , " animals that had been diabetic became nondiabetic , " at least temporarily , says Teissdre . His team envisions developing wines that could be marketed as medicinal beverages  --  with extra polyphenols for preventing heart disease and fighting diabetes . <p> CAUTION ADVISED It 's still too early to know the medical significance of all these tantalizing new findings , observes endocrinologist Nathaniel Clark of the American Diabetes Association in Alexandria , Va . Some may not hold up in long-term dietary tests in people . Even if they do , he notes , it would be " a tragedy " for people to think that supplementing their diets with coffee , tea , spices , or alcohol could take the place of moderate weight loss , regular physical activity , and restricted carbohydrate intake . <p> Moreover , Clark cautions , certain of these dietary adjustments should n't be adopted without advice from a physician . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee  --  the amount showing an antidiabetes effect in the recent European studies  --  might prove too much for people with certain heart problems . <p> And though the diabetes association currently accepts that a daily serving or two of alcohol can fit into the diet of people with the disease , Clark warns that " the risk of overconsumption of alcohol remains , regardless of any potential benefit . " <p> The bottom line , he says , is that people with diabetes should consider any of the potential new menu changes as an addition to existing dietary , weight-control , and exercise strategies  --  not as a means to avoid them . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : WHAT A KICK  --  Though caffeine makes blood sugar concentrations spike , certain trace ingredients in coffee ameliorate that effect . And one study has found that decaf lowers blood sugar . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : CINNAMON ' N SUGAR  --  The same kind of cinnamon that goes into an apple pie can boost insulin activity and blood-glucose control , studies show . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wine offer antidiabetic effects  --  at least in mice . <p> By Janet Raloff <p>
