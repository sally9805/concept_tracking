ON A RECENT Friday evening , E. Nancy O'Liddy , a member of St. Edward 's Catholic Church in Bowie , Maryland , rushed from her job near Capitol Hill back to this suburb to give her 71year-old mother a bath . " Mom 's had eight strokes . Caring for Mom has taken over the life of our family , " she said . " Tonight 's my night to take care of her . We have to feed her , wash her hair-help her with her finances . " O'Liddy is one of the more than 25 million Americans who care for chronically ill or disabled family members . On January 3 the White House unveiled proposals to be included in the fiscal year 2000 budget that would create a $1,000-a-year tax credit to help families cover the cost of home-based care for elderly parents , disabled spouses or children . Beyond the economic toll caregiving can exact on families , it also-as religious communities are increasingly realizing-can exact an emotional and spiritual price . And they are seeking ways to respond . In midNovember , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. John 's Episcopal Church in Washington , D.C. , honored the work of caregivers with prayers and special music . " I . . . encountered the issue when I was 12 years old , when my father became terminally ill with leukemia . My mother worked hard to care for him at home .... Today , the situation of my mother , who is 92 years old , is never far from my mind . I am her eldest daughter . . . so she feels particularly reliant on me , " Rosalynn Carter told the U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging at a hearing on caregiving issues late last year . " One of my colleagues has said there are only four kinds of people in the world : those who have been caregivers ; those who currently are caregivers ; those who will be caregivers ; and those who will need caregivers . That 's how universal this issue is , " Carter said . " Caregiving can be a 24-hour responsibility , " said Suzanne Mintz , president of the National Family Caregivers Association based in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as professional experience . During the service at St. John 's , she thanked her husband , Steven , who has multiple sclerosis , for supporting her work on behalf of caregivers . Faith communities , large and small , are becoming aware of how much they can do to support caregivers , Mintz said . " Size is n't the issue here . Compassion is . " From South Carolina to Nevada , congregations are beginning to help caregivers throughout the year . Shirley Whitcome is a member of the caregivers support group of 600member First United Methodist Church in Carson City , Nevada . She 's the caregiver for her 94-year-old mother-in-law . " She 's legally blind and her hearing 's poor , " Whitcome said . " I shop for her . Take her to the doctor . She 's getting dementia . " Her support group , Whitcome said , is enormously helpful . " Everything that 's said is confidential , " she noted . " We talk about things you would n't talk about with your children . You do n't want to burden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a caregivers resource guide expected to be available this month . Kay McClure , a registered nurse , is the health minister of 3,000-member First Presbyterian Church in Spartanburg , South Carolina . A year ago the church started a monthly support group for caregivers . The group members ask " really big questions with no easy answers , " McClure said . " Sometimes people are angry at God . Some feel doubts about their faith . Often they do n't know what to pray for . They ask , should you pray for your loved ones to be healed ? Or because there 's been so much suffering for them to die ? " In addition to prayers and support groups , congregations are supporting caregivers in practical ways . At St. John Vianney Catholic Church , a 16,000-member Houston parish , for example , two teams of volunteers provide respite care to family members caring for loved ones who are ill . " The volunteers stay with ill members so that their caregivers can do errands , go out for lunch or spend time with themselves , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They 'll talk with the patients or help feed them . " Judaism highly values " the dignity of the elderly " and has a high commitment to supporting families , said Rita Keenan , a social worker with the Council for Jewish Elderly in Chicago . " Our monthly support group for caretakers of people with Alzheimer 's is a safe place to talk about scary issues that many do n't want to hear about . " Caregiving raises difficult issues for religious people , according to C. Roy Woodruff , executive director of the American Association of Pastoral Counselors . " They want to honor their mother or father , for example , " he said . " But they feel guilty if they 're angry at God for having to care for their parents . The anger and guilt can become overwhelming . " But despite their anger and guilt many caregivers keep their faith . " I do n't know why I still have my faith , but I do , " O'Liddy said . " I know God 's there for me and will only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Antiabortion methods under legal scrutiny A Web site that targets doctors who perform abortions is the subject of a trial that opened January 7 in Oregon . Meanwhile , a Florida abortion clinic owner has sued two online services , claiming that they provided antiabortion activists with personal information about visitors to her facility . The trial in Portland , Oregon , centers on a Web site called " The Nuremberg Files : Visualize Abortionists on Trial " and whether it is a threat to physicians or a protected form of free speech . The trial is the result of a suit by the Portland Planned Parenthood chapter , a Portland clinic and five doctors who are seeking $200 million in damages from Advocates for Life Ministries , the American Coalition of Life Activists and other individuals who disseminate information about the Web site and distribute fliers and wanted posters criticizing abortion providers . Monica Miller of Milwaukee , the leader of Citizens for a Pro-Life Society and a former defendant , said the plaintiffs " want to suppress pro-life speech " that groups like hers use to " expose the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Web site and posters could incite violence that is banned by the 1994 Freedom of Access to Clinics law . " Sites like Nuremberg are a threat to doctors because the antiabortion movement in the United States follows up . . . with violence , " argued Bonnie Jones , an attorney for the New York-based Center for Reproductive Law and Policy . " These are not words in isolation . They are typically followed up with murder . " On the Web site , the names of four doctors and two clinic workers who have been killed since 1993 are crossed off . One of those names is Barnett Slepian , a doctor in Amherst , New York , who provided abortions and was murdered by a sniper in his kitchen on October 23 . The Florida suit , filed recently in Orlando , names CompuServe and TML Information Services , which antiabortion activists allegedly used to get names and addresses from license plate numbers of cars driven to the clinic . The lawsuit seeks an injunction to stop the activities of abortion opponents who observe the Aware Woman Center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Melbourne , Florida . " Heaven knows we 've been intimidated many , many times , " said Patricia Baird Windle , the clinic 's owner . Visitors to the facility have received letters from antiabortion opponents . In one case , the activists learned the identity of a clinic visitor , trailed her to a hospital and also followed her in a department store , the suit states . The lead defendant in the suit , antiabortion activist Meredith Raney , declined comment . A CompuServe spokeswoman said she was not aware of the lawsuit and could n't comment on it . A lawyer for the clinic said Compuserve has stopped providing the sought-after information , and TML Information Services no longer permits Raney to use its services . - RPS Cuba policy wins tepid Protestant support The Clinton administration 's easing of economic and travel restrictions on Cuba has won the qualified support of American Protestants who participate in ministry and policy advocacy involving the Caribbean island nation , but they have criticized the new policy for failing to lift the 37-year-old U.S. economic embargo against Cuba . Approved on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to send payments of up to $1,200 a year to Cuban families , instead of just individuals ; increase charter passenger flights to and from Cuba ; permit food and agricultural supplies to be sold to Cuban nongovernmental groups ; and institute direct mail service . The National Council of Churches , while welcoming Clinton 's policy change , took the president to task for not taking up the suggestion of Senator John Warner ( R. , Va. ) , which calls for the creation of a bipartisan commission that would engage in a wholesale review of U.S. Cuba policy . " We do not feel that these measures are sufficient to resolve the conflict that has divided the two nations over the last 40 years , " and in rejecting Warner 's recommendation for a bipartisan commission , the U.S. " has missed an historic opportunity " to review a policy " that has been demonstrated to be ineffective for the past 37 years , " Joan Brown Campbell , NCC general secretary , told Clinton in a letter . " This proposal is supported not only by both parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States , of which the church is a part , " she said . Thom White Wolf Fassett , a member of the Americans for Humanitarian Trade with Cuba Advisory Council , called the Clinton administration 's actions " commendable " but unlikely to provide the necessary steps toward ending the embargo . " It 's a preliminary step , timid at best , in responding to the needs of the people of Cuba , " said Fassett , who is also general secretary of the United Methodist Board of Church and Society . The United Methodist Church , the nation 's second largest Protestant denomination , is on record calling for an end to the U.S. embargo against Cuba . Michael Rivas , a Cuban-American and a deputy general secretary of the United Methodist Board of Global Ministries , agreed that " anything that in any way contributes to easing some of the problems has to be welcome . " But noting the church 's opposition to the embargo , Rivas said , " By that standard , this action is superficial . " - RNS Family members seek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an alleged doomsday cult , are trying various means , including going to court and holding vigils , in an effort to make contact with family members in the group and woo them away from what some believe is a cult that may be headed for a millennium-oriented act of self-destruction . In England , meanwhile , police have warned Israeli diplomats of a possible attack by members of the Denverbased group . The cult 's leader , Monte Kim Miller , is believed to be hiding in England . On January 8,14 members of the group were deported from Israel and returned to Denver . In an effort to speak to their loved ones , relatives held a vigil at the Denver hotel where the cult members were staying . " All they want is to talk to their loved ones and to tell them they love them , " said Sherry Clark , speaking on behalf of the relatives . Clark 's daughter is a member of the group but was not among those deported . Jennifer Cooper , the daughter of sect member John Cooper , went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the estate of her father . She said she believes her father has given at least $1.5 million to Miller and the cult . On January 7 , Boulder District Judge Carol Glowinsky granted the petition . The elder Cooper did not appear in court to contest the ruling . Cooper 's daughter said she hoped the action " will bring him back home and make him think about something besides that cult . " In her petition , Jennifer Cooper said she thinks her father has been " brainwashed " by Miller , a native of Burlington , Colorado , who formed the Concerned Christians group in the late 1980s . In London the Jewish Telegraph Agency reported that Israel and Britain have been sharing information in an effort to track the movements of cult members . Some of Miller 's disciples are believed to have accompanied him to Britain , while others are thought to be in Mexico and Greece . About 70 members of the group disappeared from Denver last fall . - RNS German churches call for debt cancellation Protestant and Roman Catholic churches in Germany have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries ' debts . In a statement , " Foreign Debt : An Ethical Challenge , " the Council of the Evangelical Church in Germany ( EKD ) and the Catholic Bishops ' Conference also proposed conditions that need to be fulfilled if the foreign debts are to be deferred or canceled . The German religious leaders argued that forcing poor countries to adopt so-called structural adjustment measures-reshaping their economies to finance their debt burden at the expense of social spending on health and education-is not an answer to the debt problem . Instead , debt relief must be aimed at fostering social and ecological improvements , the reduction of illiteracy rates and improvement in the education and health systems . Constitutional and democratic reforms , reduction of corruption , slowing the flight of capital out of poor countries and restricting military spending are other criteria the religious leaders said should be used in assessing debt reduction proposals . " Debt-free countries which do not conduct any internal reforms will not have any credit rating on the international capital markets , " the paper said . The joint statement recalled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which debts were to be forgiven and land returned to its original owners every 49 years . - RNS Briefly noted The Yearbook of American and Canadian Churches , a popular resource prepared annually by the National Council of Churches , will be supplemented by a CD-ROM and Web-based products during the next three years . A $635,000 redevelopment grant from the Lilly Endowment , an Indianapolis-based foundation , has made the advances possible . " The new CD-ROMs will , for the first time , assemble all of the 67 years of church membership and finance data in a single place , " said yearbook editor Eileen W. Lindner . The 1999 edition of the yearbook , which is published by Abingdon Press in Nashville , Tennessee , is scheduled to be available February 1 .

Six evangelical Christian organizations are pooling their resources in an effort to identify every evangelical church in the world . The " Church in Habitat " project , coordinated at Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary in Wake Forest , North Carolina , is a combination of new computer technology and traditional personal contact . The other partners are the Jesus Film Project , Campus Crusade for Christ , Wycliffe Bible Translators , DAWN ( Discipling a Whole Nation ) and the International Mission Board of the Southern Baptist Convention . The six groups are combining their efforts to " find out where the churches are located , so we can find out where new churches need to be planted , " said Ed Pruitt , project administrator .
