" Ern-esssss-teeeeeen ! " <P> Bill Bradley has lost his wife . He calls her name while charging toward the church across the street from his childhood home in Crystal City , Mo. , but Ernestine Schlant has vanished . She is trapped somewhere behind the electronic thicket  --  a mad bristling of boom mikes and long lenses , tape recorders and power packs , TV cameras shouldered by guys who look like defensive linemen gone to seed , all of them barreling hell-bent for Bradley . <P> Welcome to the official walking tour of Bradley 's old hometown , where this morning he announced ( again ) what everyone already knew : that he is trying to snatch the Democratic nomination from Al Gore . Bradley should have called this the speed-walking tour . The lapsed Senator is really working those long , NBA-tested legs , partly because he feels good  --  his kickoff speech went well , close to 100 media types are covering him , and the latest polls put him just a few points behind Gore in New Hampshire  --  and partly because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants to lead us to the banks of the Mississippi before then . " I want you all to see the riv-er the way I see the riv-er , " he says , letting the word roll out slowly , a promise of ineffable revelations to come . Events such as this , designed to show off a candidate 's small-town heart , tend to feel like Hollywood location shoots  --  superimposed on a place . Bradley wants to prove he has a real connection to this one . But first he has to find his wife . " Ernestine ! " <P> With her pixieish smile intact , Ernestine manages to dart out of the thicket and rejoin her husband . Now he can play tour guide  --  a mordant commentator who wants us to know he finds this ritual , like so many other campaign rituals , faintly ridiculous . " All right , well , this is the church , " he says . " These trees are tulip trees . And as you can see , it 's one of those great stone churches . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffered from calcified arthritis of the spine , used to " sit and look out at this churchyard , and it gave him a sense of peace , because it was always green , and it was always peaceful , and it was , um , a wonderful place . " He pauses for a beat . " O.K. , that 's the church . Now we 'll see the bank . " <P> And he 's off , power walking across the churchyard with the cameramen jousting and stumbling behind . After a brief stop at the bank , he leads us to the edge of a vast , weed-choked parcel that for 100 years was home to a plate glass factory , Crystal City 's economic raison d'etre . The plant 's 1990 closing sapped the town 's strength , so another politician might use the moment to rail against Corporations That Turn Their Backs on Our Communities . Bradley looks for poetry instead . The missing landmark " tells me life has unknown terms and change is all around us , " he says , " and some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
