Fifty years from now , will anyone be singing those fabulous songs from the Gulf War ? Oh , that 's right , there were n't any . And we 'd guess that few families gather round the piano to sing of the invasions of Grenada and Panama . Vietnam is pretty much an angry face-off between Staff Sergeant Barry Sadler ( The Ballad of the Green Berets ) and Country Joe &; the Fish ( I-Feel-Like-I'm-Fixin ' - to- Die Rag ) . The Korean War has a memorial now , but still no memorable songs . It 's as if , after World War II , Americans decided that internationally sanctioned slaughter was no longer something to sing about . <P> Ah , but WWII ! The Good War . The war . The bigger , better sequel to the War to End All Wars . With a unified national will to defeat the Axis , and Broadway , Hollywood and Tin Pan Alley operating at full throttle , every G.I. could hit the beach with a song in his backpack . Terrific songs , many of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look good on the bandbox stage of Manhattan 's Blue Angel Supper Club in a larkish but poignant revue called Swingtime Canteen , directed by Kenneth Elliott . <P> It 's London , 1944 . Marian Ames , the ever-so-gracefully-aging screen queen , is fronting an all-girl band to entertain the Eighth Air Force with tunes that spotlight some of the era 's premier lyricists . They play Frank Loesser 's Love Is n't Born , It 's Made ; Johnny Burke 's Thank Your Lucky Stars and Stripes and His Rocking Horse Ran Away ; Don Raye 's Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy , Rhumboogie and Beat Me , Daddy , Eight to the Bar . As in any creative assembly , there are spells of emotional fireworks . But the ladies play and sing handsomely , even during an air raid , and especially when remembering their beaux back home . <P> Driven by the top musical salesmanship of perky Marcy McGuigan , tomboyish Debra Barsha , sassy Jackie Sanders and little-girl-lost Emily Loesser ( Frank 's daughter ) , this band echoes Sweet Sue and Her Society Syncopators , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like It Hot . Appropriately , Charles Busch , the off-Broadway drag star who co-authored Swingtime 's mint-thin book ( with Linda Thorsen Bond and William Repicci ) , is now playing Marian . <P> As a singer , Busch is a dynamite actress . To the task he brings a heroic vibrato and a trouper 's frozen wide-screen smile . Imagine Tallulah Bankhead working the low notes and Shirley Temple the high ones on the Johnny Mercer-Harold Arlen Ac-cent-tchu-ate the Positive , and you have an idea of the suave campery at which Busch excels . <P> But Swingtime Canteen is not an excuse for a drag show . It is an evocative balancing act of music and comedy , parody and sentiment . The girls strut their tight harmonies with an Andrews Sisters medley  --  12 songs !  --  that 's a wowser . And they escalate into feeling with I 'll Be Seeing You . This gorgeous rendition works as a reminder of what the boys were fighting for , and what any struggle  --  war in the ' 40s , AIDS in the ' 90s  --  means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet , frail hope .
