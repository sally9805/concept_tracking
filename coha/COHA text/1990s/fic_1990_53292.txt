In 1858 the slave called Lize was hung in Louisville , Georgia , for the murder of her master 's son . I was twelve that day , and now I 'm ninety , but I still see her bare feet , scratched and dusty from being dragged down the road . Those feet dangle among leaves so green they writhe like flames . I stand in the garden . The perfume of gardenias makes me dizzy enough to faint . <p> From where I hang , I see a woman thrown from a ship because her child don ' come . She screams too loud and long . The others lift her over the rail , let her fall . They all touch her . They all say : I 'm not the one . I see the mother of my mother , standing naked on a beach . The men look her over , burn a mark on her thigh . She squats in a cage for fifteen days . Flies land on her face . She don ' swat them away . I see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got less room than he got in the grave . They panic , break their own ankles , smother in their own waste . They jump if they get the chance . Black sea swallow a black man . Nobody stop to find him . On the distant shore I see a runaway stripped of his own skin like a rabbit , torn limb from limb . To teach the others . I see Abe 's head . I crawl on my hands and knees , look for his ears . But Walkerman takes them . Did you see how long a man bleeds ? Did you see how his head festers in the heat , no way to clean those wounds though I wash him morning and night . <p> Mama died of a five-day fever we could n't break with wet towels and ice baths . She left her baby squalling with hunger . That 's why Father brought Lize to the house , to keep Seth alive . My brother , four months old , still wrinkled and nearly hairless , was going to have a full-grown woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abided seeing Lize close to her boy . Father owned more than thirty Negroes , but Mama kept an Irish girl , Martha Parnell , to brush her hair and make her bed , to wipe the vomit off the floor during the weeks when her belly first began to swell , to rock the baby during the days when she lay dying . Mama would n't have no nigger woman upstairs , touching her child , fondling the silver-handled mirror on her dresser or cleaning the long , light hairs out of her comb . She said they were dirty , first of all , and they had appetites dangerous to men ; she did n't want Seth getting used to the smell of them . Only Beulah , the cook , two hundred twenty pounds and fifty-seven years old , was allowed to stay in the house while Mama was living . And Beulah was allowed to care for me , to wash the blood from my scraped knees when I fell in the yard , to lay cool rags on my head when my temperature flared , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chills . <p> Every day Mama sat for hours listening to me read from the Bible , making me repeat a verse a dozen times until every pause was perfect and every consonant clipped . She smiled and closed her eyes , her patience endless : Again Selina . But she could n't bear my small wounds or mild afflictions . She had no tolerance for suffering ; my whimpering drove her from the room and made her call for Beulah to come with her root cures . And I was not permitted to hold the precious mirror or brush my mama 's hair either . She said I was too rough , too clumsy  --  seven years bad luck  --  I brushed too fast , only Martha Parnell did it right : Yes , Martha , that feels nice . I hid in the shadows of the doorway . Yes , litre that , good girl Martha , just another hundred strokes . Mama 's honey hair caught the light , shot back a thousand sparks of gold fire . Martha said , " My mum told me the angels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press the silken strands to her mouth and nose , forgetting Mama could see her in the mirror . " Stop that , " Mama said , " I do n't have time for such silliness . " Martha raised the brush , gripped it like the stick she 'd used to beat the stray dog in the yard , but she brought it down gently , brushing again  --  a hundred strokes , just like Mama said  --  before she coiled that angel hair into two thick braids and pinned them tight , high on Mama 's head . <p> Martha could n't make Seth take the bottle after Mama died . She was a spinster at twenty , a girl who never ripened , her hips narrow as a boy 's and bone-hard , her breasts already shriveled before they 'd blossomed . Her body offered no comfort to man or child . Father cursed the sight of her , abused her for the foolish way she cooed at the baby , making him cry harder till he was too hoarse to wail and only squeaked . She dipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fooled . Only Beulah could soothe him , holding him on the great pillow of her lap , quieting him with hands so fat and smooth she seemed to have no bones . She gave him a bit of cloth soaked with sugar water . He suckled and slept . Still , my father 's only son was starving ; that 's what drove him down to the slaves ' quarters , looking for Lize . <p> The man come to the shack . He say , my boy 's hungry . He pulls my dress apart at the neck , looks at my breasts like I 'm some cow . He say , looks like you got plenty to spare . <p> Secretly I was glad to hear my father rail at Martha Parnell , calling her a worthless dried-up bit-of-ground , threatening to send her scrawny ass back to Ireland if she did n't find some way to make herself useful . At my mother 's funeral , she tugged on my braids and hissed in my ear , " Looks like you 're no better'n me now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one but the devil to keep her safe from her daddy . Do n't I know . Eight of us . Mama and the ninth dead and me the oldest . Just you watch yourself , little girl , and lock your door at night . " My lack of understanding made her laugh out loud . People turned to stare . When Father caught my eye , my face burned , blood rising in my cheeks as if I 'd just been slapped . <p> Martha 's only pleasure was bringing sorrow to others . Her lies cost Abe his ears . Mama was nearing her sixth month when it happened . She yelled when a door slammed too hard , fretted when the heat got too heavy  --  she was a walking misery , despising her own bloated body , its strange new weight , its hard curves . When Martha claimed Abe cuffed her jaw and shoved her down , Mama 's judgment was swift and cruel . He was going to be an example . " Ca n't let these boys get above themselves , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always calling Abe , telling him to fetch her some water , fetch her some eggs . One day she 'd say , " Help me move this rockin ' chair , Abe . " And the next day she 'd make him move it back to where it had always been . She ran her fingers through her dry , colorless hair ; she batted her stubby eyelashes and never thanked him . <p> I knew she led him into the grove , looking for mushrooms , she said ; but as soon as the trees hid them , she grabbed his wrist and pushed her face against his , mouth wet and open for the kiss he would not give . Scorned gentleman , proper husband of another woman , he knocked the girl to the ground and fled . <p> Spitting blood from her bitten lip , Martha came complaining to Mama . False and fearful , she whispered she was lucky to have her virtue intact . " Just think what he might'a done if I had n't kicked him and run . " <p> No one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all my father . Still , the orders were given . Three other slaves held Abe down in the barn , and old Walkerman , Father 's overseer , took a knife to Abe 's head . His howls filled the yard . The green twilight pulsed with the throb of his veins . I sat on the porch , racked by dry sobs . Mama said , " Quit that fussing . It 's for your own good . If he thinks he can get away with slapping Martha , maybe he 'll go after me next  --  or you . Slaves must be obedient to their masters on earth , with fear and trembling , just as we are obedient to the Lord , " she said . " I want you to find that passage and memorize it for tomorrow 's lesson . " <p> Father gave me a swat to the back of the head . He said , " What would people think if they heard you cryin ' over some nigger boy , Selina ? " <p> In the barn , a man lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the veranda , Father kissed Mother 's radiant hair , sat down beside her , and laid his hand on her belly . " My son , " he said . <p> " I ca n't make that promise , " Mama told him . <p> That night I stood at my window and saw my father run towards the grove , a bundle in his arms . His high , black boots caught the moonlight , flashed in the dark . I followed him deep in the trees . Limbs snagged my hair ; shrubs tore at my dress . I saw the girl-child , naked on the ground , saw him raise the shovel , heard the dull crack , metal on bone , a pumpkin cleaved open to spill the seed . My father dug a shallow grave for my sister . She was small enough to hold in his two broad hands , but he let her drop , unwanted runt , the shoat that wall starve because it 's weaker than the rest , so you kill it and call yourself merciful . <p> When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I too prayed my mother 's child would be a son . <p> I saw Abe chopping cotton in the fields , his skin so black it blazed blue at noonday . For weeks he wore a bandage around his head , and I pretended his ears were growing back , that when he unwrapped himself in the evening , he could feel the first nubs , and soon , very soon , the whorls would bloom to full size , firm in the curves and fleshy at the lobes , perfect ears . I touched them in my sleep , peeled away the crust of dried blood , pressed my lips to the fine lines of his scars until they disappeared . I clambered to the edge of sleep to wake hot and tangled in my sheets , my hair damp with sweat , my chest pounding . Yes , I was the one he hit ; yes I was the one who told . <p> After Lize came , my brother ate day and night . He shrieked if she set him down . She could n't go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him on one hip . If she tried to talk to Beulah while she nursed , he 'd start to whine and then to wail . He needed every inch of her and every breath . Mama had n't had enough milk for him . After months of hunger , he was determined never to want for anything again . He seemed to know his power already , four-month-old master , king , little man . Green-eyed Lize , flesh-full from cheek to thigh , gave him her body and did not complain . <p> Lize , I do not believe you loathed my brother . You showed a certain kindness towards him , and fed him well . Soon he grew fat . His fine white hair fell out in patches and the hair that grew in its place was coarse and dark , glossy as my father 's hair . <p> Sounds new to me rose out of the night air . Whippoorwills repeated their own name , a sleepless dirge ; the wings of insects clicked and buzzed , a swarm in the yard , hissing in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distant stamping , a thunderous herd of wild horses . <p> Abe call at my window . I say , go away . I say , having no ears ai n't bad enough ? You want to die too ? But he keep callin ' so I go down . He tell me , the boy don ' eat . He say , won ' ' take no milk-wet finger . Your own baby go ' n die , Lize , and you lettin ' some white man 's child suck you dry . He cryin ' there in the bushes like some fool . I say , what you want me to do ? I say , that white boy shake the house with his screamin ' if I go . Your baby get one good meal ' fore we all dead . <p> Later there were other sounds . One night , before I learned to hide , before I learned to pull the blankets over my head and press my palms against my ears , I heard a muffled cry in the kitchen and crept down the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me up on the table . He slap me when I yell . One smack break my nose . Nobody notice bruises on a black-skinned woman , that 's what he think . He say , why fight ? I never knew no nigger woman who did n't like a white man better'n her own kind . I close my eyes . He don ' take too long . <p> I stood mute , though I saw her skirt bunched up around her waist , and my father 's pants dropped to his knees . His black boots were dull and brutal in the dim light , but the pale globes of his buttocks made him ridiculous , a child caught pissing in the woods , his tender flesh exposed . <p> I remembered my mother 's caution , her voice in my skull : A nigger woman 's appetites are dangerous to men . And I believed because she spoke to me so rarely . God is light . In Him there is no darkness . Still I was afraid , hearing Martha Parnell whisper : Nothing but a motherless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe from her daddy . The son of Noah saw his father drunk and naked and did not turn away . So Ham was cursed , forced to be a slave of slaves to his brothers  --  because his brothers were good , because his brothers walked backwards to their father and covered his nakedness without looking . Read it again , Mama said , slowly Selina , open your vowels . <p> The morning I woke with blood on my sheets , I wept half the day , until Beulah came to me , held my hand between her two soft hands , and explained the life of a woman to me . Later she laughed with Lize in the kitchen , shaking over the joke of me , mouth wide , pink tongue clicking : Silly white girl , cryin ' over a bit of blood , and then , the terrible words again : Motherless child don ' know nothin ' . <p> Fool or not , I stole a knife from the kitchen , hid it under my pillow , slept with one eye open . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my father cuss . No one was laughing now . I scuttled down to the bottom of my bed and buried myself beneath the heavy blankets . I almost wished to smother , to have him find me there in the morning and repent . <p> Abe came to me that hot night . I was blue-veined and pale . In the grove , I knelt beside him and touched his dark back , making his muscles mine . I laid my hands on his chest , drained him until my skin was black and he turned white and woman in my hands . <p> They bury my boy ' fore I know . I go down to the shack . Don ' wake nobody . Don ' want to see the husband all weepy-eye , ear-place bloody I know ' cause he pick the scabs when he not thinking . I find the heap of ground . I dig in the loose dirt . Don ' take me long , he not bury deep . I hold my baby next to my naked breast . Eat , I say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of his nose and ears , pull a clot from his mouth . He smell bad and I cry and cry but I don ' make no sound . I say , God , you ai n't nothin ' but a dark horse stamping on my soul . <p> My brother 's tiny coffin had flowers enough to drown him : gardenias and orchids , lilies so white I was afraid to stare , afraid my gaze would stain them . The gravestone was twice the size of Seth , its four carved names too great a burden for a six-month-old boy to bear . <p> When they come lookin ' for me , I don ' tell no lies . I say , I smothered him between my own breasts . He beat and beat at me with those tiny fists , but I hold him tight till he go limp in my arms . I hold him tight , then I put him in his basket , rock him all night . <p> Lize , I condemned you for the murder of my brother , execrated you for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You were dangerous to men in ways my mother never dreamed . What fellowship has Fight with darkness ? Devil in a woman 's shape , you kept me pure , but I thought you deserved to hang , unnatural woman , I 'll say it plain : death for death , justice simple and swift . <p> I never risked my father 's curse , never spoke of the ring of bruises on your wrists the day you died or the scratches on my father 's face , though I knew well what these signs meant . <p> At dusk , Abe cut her down , lifted her in his powerful arms as if she weighed no more than a child . Beulah followed , her face a map of sorrow , rivers of blood in the lines of her cheeks , broad forehead a desert to march , bodies laid out in the sun , mountains to rot behind her eyes . <p> In the shack , the women washed the body in silence , no sound but the wringing of rags and drip of water . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were beautiful and clean , toes dark as polished stones . They dressed her in white , wrapped her hair in gauze , folded her hands across her chest . <p> At nightfall the keening of women rose from the shack . Their moans raised Lize up to the arms of God and he took her , begged her for forgiveness  --  poor , betrayed murderer . <p> The cicadas screamed in the heat of the day , the buzz of their wings a wild cry . A constant , rising hum and hiss swelled in waves , a torrent surging through the endless days of summer . In the morning I 'd find their shells belly up on the steps , a horde that had tried to invade the house each night , and each night failed . <p> The cotton fields steamed . All day the Negroes chopped , backs stooped , knees bent . All day they coughed , choking on cotton dust . When they stood to clear their lungs , Walkerman cracked his whip , crippled them with a shout . Even the women with bellies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and they had to be carried to the shade . Walkerman waved salts under their noses . If they woke , he put them back to chopping until they fell again . <p> My father festered , grew foul with self-pity . The best part of him , the beloved son , was dead . The sound of his boots on the porch scattered us like mice , sent us all skittering to separate corners of the house . At night , he paced the hallway , and I tossed , gripping the knife whenever his shadow darkened the line of light at the bottom of my closed door . <p> Martha Parnell still owed Father five years for her passage to America , but in August he sold her time to Walkerman for a single dollar . In the first month she lost three teeth to his fists , paying at last for Abe 's ears . By the fifth month she was swollen up like a spider , her great load teetering on spindly legs . As soon as one child stopped suckling , another began to grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started and Walkerman and my father went off to fight . <p> Walkerman never did come home . Even his body disappeared , was buried with a dozen others in a common grave or left to rot on the road , bloated and black with worms . Martha was free but had no money and nowhere to go . She stayed long enough to see my father 's fields scorched , long enough to see the fine house fill with dust and start to crumble . One day she told me she was going to find Walkerman . I imagined she felt some misguided sense of devotion and wanted the father of her children to have a Christian burial . But I was mistaken . " Have to be sure the bastard 's really dead , " she told me . <p> My father lost his legs and his mind in that war . I nursed him for ten years , saw his nakedness daily and could not turn away as the good sons of Noah had . His chest shrank , his eyes fell back in his skull , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only his hands were spared . Huge and gnarled , they flailed at the air , cuffed me when I came too near , clutched me in his fits of grief . When he wept , he did not call to Seth or my mother . No , he mourned only for his own legs , kept asking where they were , as if I might know , as if I had hidden them . <p> Though I knew he could not stand , sometimes I saw him at my bedroom door . His boots gleamed . " Touch me , " he wheezed , " I 'm cold . " <p> To save what little money I could for train fare to Chicago , I buried him in a four-foot box and marked his grave with a wooden cross . The big man fit in a boy 's coffin , and I believed I had nothing left to fear . <p> I fled the South to take a job as a teacher at a Catholic school . Father would have detested me for this : tasting their bread , drinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my mouth . My constant sins were the lies I told , pretending to be Catholic . Mornings I woke at five to pray . At each station of the cross I murmured : Hail Mary , full of grace . The Lord is with thee . Blessed art thou among women . And blessed is the fruit of thy womb , Jesus . <p> In the chill of those lightless winter mornings , I almost believed in this God who could change himself to human flesh and die for me . But alone , in my room , the prayers that rose in my heart called out to another god . There were no crosses , only the leafless trees beyond my window . <p> All these years I have lived in one room , cramped and dim , a place I chose because it did not burden me with spaces to fill . There were no hallways to swarm with drunken soldiers , no parlors to become hospital rooms for the one-armed men , no banisters to polish , no crystal to explode against the wall when my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass with frenzied hands , no scent of gardenia in the spring to make me sick with memory . <p> Still , there was room enough for my father , withered in my daydreams , spitting gruel back in my face when I tried to feed him , but tall and thick through the chest at night , stamping with impatience , his boots loud as hooves on bare wood . There was room for my brother , his puling cries when he was hungry , and then , his unbearable silence . And there was always room for you , Lize . For seventy-eight years I have watched you hang . <p> My brother and I were the last of my father 's line . Your blood spilled on the ground and flowed like a river to the sea . Ours dried in my veins . You died for my silence . Untouched by a man , unloved by a child , I never mourned the slow death of my body , but now I see this is your just revenge . <p> All day she sways in the wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roams the streets . Her bare feet leave no mark in snow . I have seen her often and prayed she would not know me . Tonight I duck into an alley . Garbage is piled high ; the shadows are alive , crawling with rats . Lize follows . She has no age , but I am a fleshless woman , bones in a bag of skin . Murderer , she whispers . I am too frail to flee . I see you watchin ' your daddy and me . She pins me to the wall . You don ' say nothin ' . Her knee jabs my brittle pelvis ; the bones of my back feel as if they 'll snap . You kill me , and my child too . She holds my arms outstretched . I dangle in her grasp , toes barely touching the ground , legs weak as clay pocked by rain . You take A he 's ears , she says , I ca n't find them . <p> " No , Walkerman tacked them to his wall , " I say . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " No , that was Martha . " <p> Whitewoman , you all look the same to me . You all kill us with desire . <p> I crumple to my knees , alone in the alley . " I never touched him , " I say , " only in a dream . " The wind whistles down the canyon of brick , repeating Lize 's last word . I sob between two garbage cans . The smell is sweet and foul , gardenias rotting in the heat , but I am cold , so cold . <p> I curl into a ball , tight as a fist , small as an ear . The snow is falling . Rats sniff my ankles and scurry away . I am not even food enough for them . Voices hover . Hands stroke my face , hands softer than my mother 's hands , fingers tender as Beulah 's  --  Mother never touched me that way . Soon enough the voice is human . The hands shake my shoulder , call me back from the dead . <p> " Honey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your way ? " The woman 's dark face is close to mine , her breath warm with whiskey . " Let Ruthie help you , honey , " she says . " Tell Ruthie where you live . " <p> At first I am afraid , Lize . I think it is you in disguise , come back fat as Beulah to torture me again . But no , this woman knows nothing of my crimes . She is condescending and kind . In her eyes , I am harmless , my white skin too withered to despise . She helps me find my way home , half carries me up the stairs , sets me in my chair by the window , and covers my legs with a blanket . She asks if she can heat some soup , but I say , " No , please go . " <p> From where I hang , 1 see all the brown-skinned children . You think your death can save them ? Your father 's blood runs dark in the veins of my children . Your father ' s blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your father 's blood destroys us all again and again . <p> " Forgive me , " I whisper . The fog of my breath turns to frost on the windowpane . Chill has turned to fever . I can not kneel or stand , so I sit at my window and wait . <p> Listen Lize , I am a dessicated shell of a woman , a cicada you could crush with one step . Put your weight on me , and be done with it . I am old enough and prepared to die . <p> She does not answer . Her eyes are always open , bulged and blind ' . She never looks at me . At dusk , Abe comes and cuts her down . I follow her all night , calling her name down unlit alleys . I hear her breath when she stops to rest . But she is a cruel god , she who becomes flesh only to be crucified again and again . At dawn , I am still alive . At dawn , Walkerman ties a noose . Everywhere the silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is black and shiny as wet skin . Soon the men will drag Lize down the road , haul her up , and let her fall . I will see her wrists tied , her blouse torn ; I will see her bruised and battered feet . And I will sit , just as I do now , mute witness to her endless death . <p> <p> By MELANIE RAE THON <p>
