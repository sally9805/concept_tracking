<p> Post readers vent views on federal budget imbroglio <p> If we had a few statesmen in Congress , I am sure they would start by eliminating all of the obsolete commissions and useless departments that have been set up to reward political supporters with jobs , put limits on the obscene raises and perks Congress has voted themselves . Make a time limit on the perks and security given the past presidents , after all they are just unemployed politicians . Cut the staffs of Congress and get rid of the nonproducers in all departments , make the so-called Presidential Libraries self-supporting . It would go a long way toward balancing the budget . <p> OREN W. RICKER <p> Westminster <p> The recent actions of our Republican trust in Congress makes me think of a well-intentioned parent performing a well-intentioned duty when he tells his child , " You 're not eating right . Your health is my concern . Unless and until you agree to eat what I offer , that which I know is best , you will eat nothing . " <p> JESSE G. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fast one on us . The temporary shutdown of the federal government is the result of their most recent tactic of holding the nation hostage in a bid to force passage into law of numerous controversial initiatives . The Congress , unwilling to compromise on these sometimes radical measures , knows the president would veto most of them if they were submitted to him separately . Instead , they are trying to force these measures into law by attaching them to the stop-gap funding and debt-ceiling bills , as well as seven budget bills . Thus , if the president wants the government to be open for business , he has to swallow some pretty objectionable stuff . <p> The stakes are very high . Attached to these various bills are riders that would begin the process of selling national parks and other fragile public lands ; provide new subsidies to the largest agricorporations ; provide subsidies to the mining industry ; gut protection of wetlands ; gut protections of clean water and clean air ; and lift prohibitions on cancer-causing chemicals in certain foods . In addition , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the environment and public health . If the American people want these measures , so be it . But let these special-interest initiatives stand on their own in the full light of public scrutiny and debate , not in the shadows of vast appropriations bills . <p> EVAN A. EVANS <p> Boulder <p> The Republican litany continues to be " the failure of ' liberal ' Democratic policies of the last 30 years . " <p> Fact : For the last 31 years 1965-95 , a Republican administration has been in charge for 20 years , and a Democratic administration has been in charge for 11 years . <p> Think about it . Seems pretty clear what has been amiss . <p> WALTER FRULAND <p> Lakewood <p> I am writing to explain and clarify the president 's plan to save Medicare . It is as follows : <p> TOM RUSSELL <p> Sedgwick <p> William Howard Taft , president ( from 1909-1913 ) was quoted as saying " Politics make me sick . " <p> It would appear " politics is making a lot of people sick . " The power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third party seem viable . <p> MAYMIE ROLFS <p> Lakewood <p> I agree with Al Knight that the press should be more balanced in reporting , but where was he when the Republicans were getting all the favorable press over their revolutionary " contract " ? <p> Judging from his stance on the budget battle and other issues he has commented on , " balanced reporting " means advancing a conservative Republican view . Supporting a conservative Republican viewpoint is quite legitimate , but he should n't be hypocritical in doing so . <p> RON COOKE <p> Denver <p> What 's wrong with this picture ? Our national budget includes 44 percent for military , 13 percent poverty programs , 9 percent social programs . While haggling is going on within Congress about increasing the monthly Medicare recipient 's payments , cutting welfare and monies for the National Parks etc. , the Pentagon gets more than the department asked for . <p> In 1960 personal income tax provided about 52 percent of government revenue , while corporate taxes were at 27 percent . Now personal taxes are at about 62 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this what the American people want ? A bloated military ? Ordinary citizens shouldering more of the burden of running the government while huge corporations get off with tax credits and the like ? <p> JANET AMBLER CARTER <p> Denver <p> Let me get this straight . Mr. Gingrich prompted the budget veto because he did n't get to sit where he wanted on Air Force One ? My husband and I would n't tolerate that type of immaturity from our own son , and he 's only 10 . If Gingrich is willing to use the American public to exact revenge for the bruising of his overinflated ego , then he has no business being House speaker or representing us at all . <p> LORI FLANERY <p> Thornton <p> She said it . I did n't , but it occurred to me and many others . Cynthia Tucker , a columnist who appears in your pages frequently , in a recent television round table , pointed out that with only essential federal employees going to work , some people will wonder why our taxes are paying for so many employees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look for the role of the federal government ought to be the Constitution . A reading of it ( it is very brief ) points to federal authority to coin money , declare war , raise the armed forces , regulate commerce among the states , provide for a postal system and a number of traditional functions with which no one seems to argue . Nowhere will you be able to find in that document articles authorizing the support of education , the protection of the environment , the dispensing of welfare checks , provision of health benefits for either the indigent or elderly nor any of the hundreds of additional functions that the federal government has , over the years , taken unto itself . These would presumably come under the 10th amendment and be " reserved to the states respectively or to the people . " <p> No one is so naive as to think the present Congress will undo all of this , but the few small steps in that direction that members have taken , the few that they have proposed , and their avowed effort to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hang in there . <p> EUGENE L. GROSSMAN <p> Englewood <p> Sometimes I 'm embarrassed to be a Republican . The timidness of Republican leaders in regard to welfare reform and tax cuts amazes me . <p> Democrats whine " welfare for the wealthy " when they are approached with a tax break . And Republicans are letting them get away with it ! <p> There is a big difference between a tax cut and welfare . A tax break is an incentive for productivity , and welfare is an incentive for nonproductivity . Is that simple enough ? <p> You can not compare government 's letting the people keep more of what they earn by providing a product or service with charity . <p> But Democrats usually make the phony comparison , and Republicans do n't seem to care . Well , I care . If timid Republican leaders need a bumper-sticker response , my suggestion is " Reward productivity , Stupid . " <p> STEVE SCHWEITZBERGER <p> Denver <p> We all know that the Medicare program needs a good housecleaning . But , Sen. Dole and Rep. Gingrich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the " culprits " - doctors and hospitals ? They have been ripping off Medicare for years , and I know this from personal experience . Most seniors do not want a handout ; they want just what is deserved after years of paying taxes . <p> Sen. Dole and Rep. Gingrich , if you were true patriots and cared about the United States , your approach to the many problems would be to work with our president and try and iron them out , as decent , elected public officials would do . <p> If I sound disrespectful and angry , it is because I am ! I have nothing but contempt for arrogant , overbearing individuals who abuse their power and blatantly show their attitude , which obviously is : " To hell with the masses ; they are n't worth a second thought . " <p> The Dole-Gingrich " gang " would like all poor , old people to fade away . I have news for them - we are tough , and hopefully in the next election will show our strength . <p> BETTY COLSON <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his political gain " should be what the headlines read . He has been planning for this government shutdown for sometime now , and there was nothing the Republicans could do to stop it . He refused many times to talk with them and now has the audacity to say this shutdown was n't necessary . <p> Why else would the Democrats have been running the ads saying that he cares for the elderly and the young , and he 's going to stand up to the " Big Bad Congress " ? <p> Let me repeat what the press does n't seem to understand : There are no cuts in social benefits ; there is a 6 percent increase ! Clinton uncourageously is letting the Republicans make the hard decisions he is unwilling to make . Then Clinton turns around and says that their increase is not enough ! There is an old saying : " It takes a carpenter to build a barn , and any jackass can kick one down . " <p> JAY R. WREN <p> Littleton <p> Robert Friedland discusses role in Summitville mine <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Summitville indictment , The Denver Post continues an established pattern of irresponsible journalism . The fundamentals of journalistic integrity demand a retraction of several statements in your article , as well as the inflammatory and sensational headline on page 22 which reads : " Summitville Owner Leaves State and EPA Holding Bag on Cleanup . " I was never the " owner " of Summitville , which has a 100-year history of numerous owners , and I have hardly left anyone " holding the bag . " The true facts are these : <p> Again , I was never the owner of either the Summitville mine or Galactic Resources , Inc . Until I severed all connections with the company in 1990 , I owned a minority-share holding interest in Galactic Resources Ltd . There were several shareholders who owned a much larger stake , which is a fact your paper has never cared to mention . <p> You state that Summitville General Manager Samye N. Buckner " was Friedland 's top person in Colorado " and " is working in Asia on another Friedland mining project . " I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where Buchner now works . <p> I have hardly left anyone " holding the bag " with respect to the Summitville cleanup . I was supportive of efforts being organized by the mining industry to clean up this mine site in a responsible and cost-effective way before the site was listed on the National Priorities List by EPA . I have long been willing to make a voluntary contribution to such an effort , even though I have no legal responsibility to do so . This may no longer be possible because of EPA involvement at the site . The EPA-sponsored project - at a reported cost of $ 120 million or more - is an unnecessarily expensive effort that continues to be subjected to intense criticism from objective citizen groups , technical experts and members of Congress . <p> I hope you see fit to publish this letter to correct the record . Unfortunately , the history of your sensationalist approach on Summitville has left your readership " holding the bag . " ROBERT M. FRIEDLAND <p> Vancouver , B.C.
