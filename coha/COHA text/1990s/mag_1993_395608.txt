Spotlights , camera , action ! One of the electrifying highlights of the New York collections was under way : the fall showing by Tracy Reese for Magaschoni at the prestigious Parsons School of Design . Her ever-so-wearable working clothes in rust-toned leathers , knits and wools  --  embellished with the most romantic embroidery and ruffles  --  were strutted down the runway on the likes of hot mannequins Tyra , Veronica Webb , Kimora and Lorraine Pascale ( to name a few ) with soft new attitude ! And one thing was clear from the enthusiastic response her freshly tailored style ( priced from $70 to $500 , retail ) received : A collection with clout had been unveiled , signaling an important change for us on the fashion scene . At 29 , with three major ( and we do mean major ) showings under her belt , Reese , a sister who hails from Motown Detroit , takes her place among New York 's young " designing darlings . " It 's a spot that suits her well . Inside the elegant beige-on-beige showroom that houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who 's based in Hong Kong , where the clothing is manufactured ) , the soft-spoken Reese is funkily clad in all black  --  peg-leg jeans and her own double-breasted fitted crepe blazer with two-tiered ruffled trim and penny loafers . Buyers from Neiman Marcus and high-profile specialty stores ( Magaschoni 's core clients ) are lining the tables  --  penning orders that will add up to between $3 million and $5 million in the annual sales that Reese 's label now generates for the company . When Reese joined the company three years ago , however , her duties consisted of merely designing an existing ( " and boring " ) bridge collection . " It was definitely not my style , but I knew this was the kind of company that could provide me with major backing for my own label , " explains Reese . She could n't have been more right . Not surprisingly , her seven-year journey into the spotlight has been fraught with fashion lessons learned the hard way  --  by running her own self-titled contemporary-sportswear firm from 1987 to 1989 , started with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ founded the company after working as a designer 's assistant at Arlequin  --  her first job fresh out of Parsons with her design degree . Sadly , Tracy Reese Designs suffered from the all-too-common malaise striking many smaller Seventh Avenue firms of " too many orders and not enough capital to handle them . " Teary-eyed but still determined to design clothes " with passion , " Reese closed her doors and moved on as designer of the Perry Ellis Portfolio line . A few months later , however , the division closed . Reese rebounded and quickly hooked up with noted sportswear designer Gordon Henderson , working as a consultant for three months before joining Magaschoni . She muses , " Gordon is like my big brother . He taught me so much about succeeding in this business . " Reese 's " passion for fashion " began back home in Detroit when she was merely a talented 10-year-old living with her modern-dance teacher mom , managerial dad and two sisters . " Mom and I would have sewing contests to see who finished their outfit first . The loser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although I generally won , I still spent every dime I had buying fabric . " But , she says , it was n't until her days at Cass Technical High School , where she was encouraged to apply for a scholarship , which she won , to Parsons that she saw designing clothes as a business . " That 's when I knew I wanted to be involved in every aspect of this business , not just stuck in some back room sketching and draping for days ! " <p>
