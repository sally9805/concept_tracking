<p> WHEN one re-examines the World War II propaganda films today , two distinct groups emerge : Those that still have dramatic , persuasive powers , and those that have dated horribly . <p> Frank Capra 's six-part " Why We Fight " series , produced for the government to indoctrinate the American soldier to a global conflict , is a prime example of writing , editing and music that still carries a powerful dramatic effect . Lena Riefenstahl 's " Triumph of the Will , " a 1935 documentation of Hitler 's hypnotic hold on the German people , is another effective piece of propaganda that manipulates the viewer . <p> As for those films that have n't withstood the test of time , and that today reflect passe thinking and racist attitudes that now seem unconscionable , the modern mind can be frequently boggled . <p> Film curator Jack Stevenson has compiled five such entertaining-disturbing short subjects for the Roxie Cinema . " Strange and Bizarre War Propaganda Films ! " will be screened at the 16th Street theater on Friday and Saturday . <p> Stevenson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Francisco , is a collector of propaganda and educational motivation films . He points out that these wartime propaganda movies now can be labeled " racist and crude , " but there was a time when " the people of this nation were caught up in the fervor of war . They had loved ones fighting and dying , and it was the mentality of the times to believe what your government told you . " <p> The most subtly disturbing of Stevenson 's choices is " Japanese Relocation , " a 1942 short subject produced by the U.S. government to justify what it had done to the Japanese population of America shortly after Pearl Harbor . You could almost look upon this " coverup " as the act of a government with a guilty conscience applying salve to psychic wounds . <p> Today we know the truth about those early months in 1942 : American paranoia and fear of fifth-column saboteurs led to Japanese American families ' being uprooted and unwillingly shipped to bleak desert camps , their property and belongings confiscated . Locked away in their arid compounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japanese Americans wasted away during those war years . <p> " JAPANESE Relocation " depicts a different " reality " : We 're told by Milton S. Eisenhower , director of the War Relocation Authority , that " we were protecting ourselves without violating the principal of Christian decency . " The Japanese Americans , we are further informed by a pleasantly voiced narrator , went peacefully to the internment camps , willingly and loyally sacrificing everything they had " for the sake of the war effort . " <p> These camps are photographed from aesthetic angles that make them appear to be clean and orderly , and the benevolent narrator tells us the Japanese Americans receive " healthful , nourishing food " as they live out meaningful , productive lives , mainly by planting gardens and orchards of rubber trees . All the scenes of the Japanese internees show smiling or tranquil faces , and there is the suggestion from their posturing that they are taking pride in their " sacrifice . " <p> If " Japanese Relocation " is subtle in its substitution of a happy lie for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1945 ) is full of bitterness and anger , uncompromising in its warning to U.S. occupational troops to look out for a population of Nazi-indoctrinated Germans that is devious and dangerous . <p> Produced under the auspices of the Army 's Special Services by Frank Capra 's 834th Photographic Signal Detachment , and designed as part of Capra 's " Know Your Enemy , Know Your Ally " series , this film contains one major irony : It was scripted by Ted Geisel , who wrote the wonderful " Dr. Seuss " children 's stories . Here Geisel reveals a dark , hateful side as he attacks the Germans with an unforgiving torrent of vitriol . <p> Narrated by Joseph Cotten , " Your Job in Germany " was designed to be seen by those soldiers newly assigned to postwar Germany . It was meant to stir up hatred and suspicions . Heavy emphasis was placed on the strict " no fraternization with the enemy " rule that dominated in those days . No matter how innocuous looking these dancing , beer-drinking Bavarian revelers might appear on the surface , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of everything German ! . . . Do n't relax because the war is over . Take every caution . The German lust for conquest is not dead . It 's gone underground . " <p> Geisel also was instrumental in writing and directing " Our Job in Japan " ( 1946 ) , another blatant example of misleading propaganda at its most venomous . This final short subject made by Capra 's documentary unit was narrated by actor Arthur Kennedy and is full of unsubstantiated claims . <p> It describes the Japanese as a violent race of people who have been raised to believe that they are sacred , destined to crush less powerful nations and rule the world . <p> According to Geisel 's inflammatory script , the Japanese brain is totally different from the brains of western civilization . He tells us that we must dissect that brain . We must cut away the cancerous growths and try to lead these misguided people back on a righteous track . <p> This material was considered so vile and misleading by General Douglas MacArthur , in command of the occupation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and demanded that the film be banned in Japan . <p> In contrast to these poisonous pieces is " Japanese Zero " ( 1943 ) , which almost plays like a campy comedy . It 's certain to evoke some laughs when Ronald Reagan pops on the screen as Saunders , a hotshot albeit fledgling P-38 fighter pilot , eager to serve his country by blasting Japanese aircraft from the skies over the Pacific . <p> A short that was intended by the Army Air Force as a training aid , and not an entertainment for the general public , " Japanese Zero " portrays Reagan as one eager fly boy , who refuses to listen to his commanding officer 's warnings that some of the new pilots are accidentally shooting down their own planes . Saunders better be sure to identify aircraft before he sets his .50-caliber machine-guns chattering . <p> So what does Reagan do on his first mission ? He almost blasts one of his own P-38s out of the sky . Back at his jungle base , Reagan is chewed out and told to go back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Naturally , Saunders gets the chance to redeem himself . <p> To conclude his propaganda package , Stevenson has selected an example of anti-Communist diatribe that he believes is predicated totally on the paranoia that afflicted this country during the hottest days of the Cold War . " Red Nightmare " ( 1962 ) was produced at Warner Bros. by studio chief Jack L. Warner , whom Stevenson says was " a rabid anti-Communist who believed there was a Communist under his bed at night . " Exactly why this film was made remains unclear ; perhaps it was simply a patriotic effort designed to be coupled with full-length Warner features . <p> Warner used many of his TV contract players working on the lot at the time : Jack Kelly , Peter Breck , Robert Conrad and Peter Brown . You know you 're in for a radical time when Jack Webb ( another anti-Communist fanatic ) steps out onto a quiet suburban street to warn us that some day we might wake up and find our society taken over by Russian forces . <p> A parable unfolds in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved in and everyone in his family has been indoctrinated to Communist ways . ( He 's been sleeping through it all . ) Military troops patrol the streets , neighbors report anyone who speaks even a potential word of treason , and Kelly , who walks through all this dumbfounded , is finally taken to the U.S. version of Moscow 's Lubianka Prison and tortured by sadistic guards . <p> When he finally awakens from his Red nightmare , Kelly is a changed man , no longer taking his routine life for granted , and treating his family with new understanding . What this domestic object lesson has to do with communism remains something of a mystery . <p> If all this sounds familiar , recall that in 1946 Arch Oboler made a movie called " Strange Holiday , " in which a businessman returns to his small town after a vacation to find it taken over by a sinister foreign government . " Red Nightmare " has the same plot , updated to include the Communist scare .
