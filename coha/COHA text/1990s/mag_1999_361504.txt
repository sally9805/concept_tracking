I do n't ask a lot from food . It should taste good and be reasonably good for me . But more and more these days we 're encouraged to view the grocery store as a medicine chest . There are tofu and yams for hot flashes . Ginseng tea for energy . Stewed tomatoes to prevent prostate cancer . So when I heard about Benecol and Take Control , the new margarines that are supposed to lower cholesterol levels in the blood , I did n't exactly smack my lips in anticipation . Still , I figured , given how much heart disease there is in the U.S. , they deserved a look . <P> Both spreads come with pretty good scientific credentials . The key ingredient in Benecol , which was approved last week by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration , comes from a compound that occurs naturally in pine trees . Take Control , which got the green light in April , uses an extract made from soybean oil . Randomized , controlled trials show that folks with mildly elevated cholesterol levels ( between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tablespoons of Benecol a day decreased their level of LDL , the " bad cholesterol , " about 14% . The manufacturers of Take Control , on the other hand , designed their product so that it would lower LDL levels 10% . Neither spread affects the level of HDL , or " good cholesterol . " Which product would work better for you , if it works at all , depends a lot on your own biochemistry . <P> Both Benecol and Take Control make it harder for the intestines to absorb cholesterol . ( About half of the cholesterol in the gut comes from your diet ; the other half gets produced by your body . ) There is evidence that the active ingredients can pull some vitamin A precursors out of circulation  --  although researchers did not consider the reduction significant . <P> So how do the spreads taste ? In a highly unscientific study , my colleague Janice Horowitz and I sampled both products . Without telling Janice which was which , I spread Benecol , Take Control and regular margarine on three pieces of whole wheat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Overall , we found all three tasted pretty much alike , although Janice described a " funny mouth feel " after eating the cholesterol-fighting spreads . I found Benecol marginally less tasty . <P> Neither product is calorie free : both contain mostly polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats . So if you eat too much , you 'll be sure to gain weight , which can raise your cholesterol levels all by itself . Nor will the spreads do you any good if you spend all your waking hours in front of a television or computer screen . <P> The biggest catch is that you have to eat three servings a day for the rest of your life . When test subjects stopped using the spreads , their cholesterol levels crept back up within a week . It 's sort of like taking medicine  --  medicine that costs as much as $5 for a week 's supply . <P> Let 's face it : even though these designer margarines appear to be safe now , who knows what we 'll learn after hundreds of millions of people have eaten them ?
