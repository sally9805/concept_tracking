There is something soul-destroying about the German Ladenschlussgesetz  --  a trade-union-inspired law that closes all the shops most of the time  --  and , right across the land , weekends in Germany are a mind-numbing experience . <P>  --  Len Deighton , Spy Line <P> You do n't have to be a secret agent to buy something in West Germany , but it may help . The federal republic can be a consumer 's nightmare , a land of seemingly permanently closed department stores , supermarkets and haberdasheries , where goods lie tantalizingly out of reach behind brightly lit show windows . Call it Shopping Hell . <P> For this , thank the Ladenschlussgesetz . Basically , shop hours are 8 a.m. to 6:30 p.m . Monday through Friday , and 7 a.m. to 2 p.m . Saturday . On the first Saturday of every month  --  " langer Samstag , " or long Saturday  --  they may stay open all day , although they do n't have to . Sundays , almost everything is closed . In East Germany the hours are more liberal but , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past . <P> Passed in 1956 at the behest of the powerful West German trade unions , the closing law has resisted almost every effort to liberalize it . Last year Bonn managed to push through an optional extension of business hours on most Thursday nights , to 8:30 p.m . For weeks afterward , people went around saying it would cost Helmut Kohl the next national election  --  and , who knows , they may be right . <P> Effectively , the law means that those who have to work must cram their shopping into a few frantic hours in the evenings or on Saturday mornings . Planning a weekend dinner party ? Best to have the menu set by Thursday night . That way you can spend the next day going from butcher to baker to candlestick maker , purchasing the ingredients . ( Germans still prefer to shop the old- fashioned way , buying a few things at a time at a multitude of stores . ) But do n't forget the Mittagspause , the lunch break that most mom-and-pop stores dutifully observe . <P> Remember holidays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Twelfth Night , Ascension , Pentecost , Easter , May Day and All Saints ' Day , predominantly Catholic Bavaria , for example , celebrates Maria Himmelfahrt ( Assumption ) , Fronleichnam ( Corpus Christi ) and , in a bow to ecumenism , the Protestants ' Buss-und Bettag ( Day of Prayer and Repentance ) . All this and June 17 ( German Unity Day ) too . <P> If by chance you are lucky enough to find a store that is open , other skills come into play . Grocery checkouts involve a race against time : the checker shovels your purchases toward you while you try to stuff them into a bag . Do n't forget your market basket either , else you 'll have to buy a plastic bag  --  or several , since each sack only holds approximately 2.3 items . Meanwhile , the people in line behind you start to grumble and push . <P> True , there is some recourse . Grocery stores at some major train stations are open evenings and Sundays , and increasingly , gas stations have tacked on convenience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , charmingly , take Saturday night off . Two other exceptions : pastry shops and florists are allowed to stay open on Sundays . You can always eat cake . Or maybe flowers .
