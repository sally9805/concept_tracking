Vinny Testaverde 's transformation from a tentative and unreliable player to a confident Cool Hand Luke of a quarterback was made complete on New Year 's Eve . He had passed every on-field test in his five months with the New York Jets , leading the Big Apple 's stepchild franchise to its first division title since the AFL-NFL merger and a bye in the first round of the playoffs . On Dec. 31 , in a meeting room at the team 's practice facility on the Hofstra campus , Testaverde was about to earn another set of high marks . " Vinny has something he 'd like to say to you guys , " Jets coach Bill Parcells told his players , and then Testaverde stepped to the podium . // " You all know about the dangers of drinking and driving , " Testaverde said , " and I want to talk to you about not making a mistake on New Year 's Eve . I 've got a videotape here to show you about a guy who made one mistake  --  just one small mistake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had fame . And he made a mistake he 'll have to live with for the rest of his life . Roll the tape . " // The room went dark . On the video screen was a life-sized image of Parcells , holding a bag of tortilla chips and warbling in a commercial you must have seen dozens of times by now : " Groovin ' ... on a Sunday afternoon .... " // From the side of the room , before the place exploded in laughter , Testaverde heard Parcells say , " You son of a bitch ! " // Even Phil Simms and Lawrence Taylor never tweaked the commandant that deftly , particularly at playoff time . But that 's a sign of just how comfortable  --  and courageous  --  Testaverde has become under Parcells . With great assistance from running back Curtis Martin and wideout Keyshawn Johnson , who combined for 331 yards and four touchdowns , V-V-V-Vinny and the Jets rewarded some of the most loyal fans on the planet on Sunday with a 34-24 AFC divisional playoff victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Jets started the week as 10-point underdogs to the Super Bowl champion Denver Broncos in the AFC Championship Game , but remember this : In the 1990 playoffs , Parcells 's New York Giants were long shots against the San Francisco 49ers in the NFC title game and against the Buffalo Bills in Super Bowl XXV . The Giants beat the Niners by two and the Bills by one . " We 're not even thinking of the Super Bowl , " said Martin , who handled the ball on 42 of the Jets ' 77 plays from scrimmage . " We 'll approach it like Denver 's our Super Bowl . " // Odd as it may sound , the Jets have a chance to win in Denver because they have a mature and consistent Testaverde on their side . The same Testaverde who , in 1988 with the Tampa Bay Bucs , threw 35 interceptions , the second-most in an NFL season ? The same Testaverde who , in his 62 starts over the five years previous to this one , led the Cleveland Browns and the Baltimore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Testaverde , now 35 , is a changed man . It 's detectable not only in the passing prowess he displayed while becoming the AFC 's highest-rated quarterback this season , but also in the self-confidence you can see when  --  unlike the old Testaverde  --  he looks you straight in the eye across the table . His father , Al , credits Vinny 's turnaround to a season under Parcells . " He respects Bill and looks at him like he 's looking at God , " says Al . " He gets confidence from having so much faith in what the Jets are doing . " // " One tiling I 'm confident of now , " Vinny says , " is that I know I can play this game as well as anyone . I do n't worry about anything except what 's happening to me right now . I 'm not sure who said it , but I 'm sort of living by this motto : Preoccupation with the past or the future is the mental enemy of competitive excellence in the present . " // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to like ? " Parcells says of his quarterback  --  is best illustrated by two plays during the regular season . // Vinny the leader . During a 10-10 game at Kansas City on Nov. 1 , the Chiefs ' corners were clinging to Johnson in tight coverage . The play the Jets were running called for him , lined up in the left slot , to run a short slant over the middle in front of the defensive back  --  " across the defender 's face , " in Jets terminology . " I made a mistake , " Johnson recalls . " I was so frustrated with their coverage that I went behind the guy and figured Vinny would see me and hit me . But he was n't expecting that , and he threw an interception . When I got to the sideline , he lit into me . ' Damn it , Key ! What the hell are you doing ! You ca n't be making mistakes like that in a game like this ! ' He was right . " // Adds Testaverde , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about me or that it looked like I threw a dumb interception . It 's about the team and the fact that in a tight game , that could have cost us a win . " The Jets won 20-17. // Vinny the clutch player . With four minutes to play in a game the Jets led 17-14 on Oct. 19 at Foxboro , New York faced second-and-seven at the Patriots ' 43 . The logical strategy would have been to feed the ball to Martin , hopefully pick up two first downs and get out of town with a win . " But Coach had faith in Vinny and went for the jugular , " says wideout Dedric Ward . Parcells wanted a bomb down the right sideline to Ward , who had drawn man-to-man coverage from cornerback Chris Canty . When he got to the line , Testaverde gave Ward a look . " A twinkle , sort of , " Ward says . " I ca n't describe it , but when I get it , I know I better run a great route . " Testaverde took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perfect , " says Ward . " Only I could have caught it . " The Jets won 24-14. // Since taking the starting job from Glenn Foley in that New England game , Testaverde has thrown 24 touchdown passes and only seven interceptions in 386 attempts , and the Jets are 11-1 . Still , in the media and from around the league come endless reminders about his dismal past . In November , Ravens owner Art Modell told a reporter to be cautious of Testaverde 's gaudy numbers . " I would hold judgment until the end of the season , " Modell said . // Fast-forward to the Jets ' first drive against the Jaguars . Shaky coming off the bye and two weeks of good old-fashioned Big Apple hype ? Not Testaverde . He hit Martin on a backside screen for 17 yards on the first play , then found Johnson on a seven-yard out pattern . After three runs by Martin carried New York to the Jacksonville 35 , Testaverde fired a 14-yard strike to running back Dave Meggett . The next play called for Johnson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the safety 's face , but behind him . That late-week adjustment was made because the Jets believed  --  correctly , as it turned out  --  that Jaguars strong safety Donovin Darius would follow the only other receiver sent out on the play , tight end Kyle Brady , who ran a nine-yard route . " I ran that post all the time at USC , " said Johnson . " I dreamed of running that post here . The safety cheated up , and Vinny put it right on me , like he 's done all year . " // That touchdown catch was the first of several big plays by Johnson , who had nine receptions for 121 yards and ran twice for 28 yards and a score . In a fitting end , Johnson , inserted on defense because of his great hands and leaping ability , intercepted Mark Brunell 's Hail Mary with nine seconds left . // So the Jets move on , following the Italian from Long Island . Al and Josie Testaverde 's five grown kids all live on the island . Every Tuesday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple 's two kids , seven-year-old Alicia and two-year-old Vincent Jr. , feast on Josie 's veal parmigiana and other specialties . Life has come full circle , and just in time for Al , who has had a heart attack and has been advised by doctors not to watch his son 's games . He views the tapes only after he knows the score and Vinny 's numbers . Those rules will change on the last Sunday of January , Al hopes . He says he 'll go to the Super Bowl if the Jets are in it . // " One wrong tick and it 's over , " Al says . " But I wo n't miss that game . If they have to bury me , bury me at the Super Bowl . " // The Jets are tantalizingly close to their first Super Bowl since Joe Namath engineered the biggest upset in pro football history 30 years ago . On Sunday there was something eerily familiar about the quarterback leaving the field as dusk settled on the Meadowlands . Dressed in the same style of uniform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this season ) , Testaverde jogged through the media and security masses , head bowed , right index finger high in the air . It 's just a coincidence that the Super Bowl is in Miami this year , as it was in 1969 , is n't it ?
