<p> Even if prayers for rain are answered this year , significant portions of California 's giant agricultural industry will wither and die during the next 20 years . <p> That 's the tough , unblinking conclusion of analysts at Moody 's Investors Service , who recently assigned a " negative credit risk " to the state 's farm sector and rural communities that depend on it for their lifeblood . <p> The rest of the country knows California as the nation 's " salad bowl and fruit basket . " The lush , seemingly endless green fields of the Central Valley and other farm districts produce 11 percent of the nation 's total cash farm receipts on just 3 percent of the nation 's agricultural land . And they pump $ 18 billion a year into the state 's economy , not counting the " multiplier " effects on other sectors of industry . <p> But crops need water , and water supplies are dwindling , drought or no drought . Relentless population growth and increased environmental demands to protect aquatic species are daily increasing competition for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the dismay of farmers who use 80 percent of the state 's available water . <p> As a new report from Moody 's observes , the federal Central Valley Project Improvement Act in 1992 dedicated 800,000 acre-feet of water  --  enough to flood 800,000 acres of land under one foot of water  --  to the Delta to protect the endangered Delta smelt and winter-run salmon . The State Water Resources Control Board is scheduled to adopt environmental standards by year-end that may further restrict exports of water from the Delta to farms and cities in the Central Valley and Southern California . And the city of Los Angeles recently gave up its claims to water from Mono Lake as the result of environmental lawsuits , making the metropolis look to other sources . <p> The state Department of Water Resources projects that even with average rainfall , there could be a state shortage of 2.2 million to 4.2 million acre-feet of water by 2020 , given rising population growth and urban and industrial demand . A drought would boost that deficit to between 5.8 million and 7.8 million acre-feet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmland will be taken out of production . To close the gap , the state would likely have to retire even more farmland and adopt tougher conservation measures . But there are limits to conservation ; after years of drought , most people already use water far more frugally than they once did . <p> Farmers whose allocations of water from state and federal projects were reduced during the drought have been pumping like mad from the ground to keep their fields green , but the result in many areas , such as Kern County , is overdrafting of aquifers and problems with groundwater quality . Over time , the cost of pumping itself becomes prohibitive . <p> Farmers also could shift from certain low-value crops that use lots of water , such as alfalfa , to higher-value crops such as nuts , fruits and some vegetables whose water needs are stingier . But not all farmland has the right soil or climate for such a switch . <p> And with profit margins already slim on many farms , it is n't feasible for growers to pay much for new facilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need . <p> The result is that farm values in parts of the Central Valley are already plummeting from highs reached in the late 1980s . Land on the west side of the San Joaquin Valley that sold for $ 3,000 an acre five years ago may be worth less than $ 1,000 an acre today . <p> For many towns and rural counties , that means a stiff loss of tax revenue . And for communities that supply farm workers , farm machinery , fertilizer and all other goods to growers , the water shortage threatens their livelihood forever . <p> California farmers are not giving up without a fight ; those who stand to lose their way of life are understandably bitter . " We are concerned that current public policy does n't seem to recognize the ( importance of ) our ability to produce food , fiber and flowers , " said Mary-Ann Warmerdam , speaking for the California Farm Bureau Federation . <p> But political forces are stacked against them . It 's hard to imagine alfalfa farmers overcoming the interests of major industries such as computers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a serious water shortage , according to a 1991 study by Spectrum Economics in San Francisco . <p> As Rodney Smith , an economist at Claremont McKenna College and co-editor of Water Intelligence Monthly , puts it , " In the end , water will be reallocated in California from agricultural to municipal and environmental purposes . The critical question is how . " <p> Most other economists , as well as many environmental organizations and legislators , believe the fairest and most efficient way would be to let farmers and rural water districts sell their water rights at a market price to those who need it more . " Voluntary transfers , with willing buyers and willing sellers , are preferable " to political water grabs , agreed the farm bureau 's Warmerdam . <p> The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California has been a leader in this regard , buying from the Palo Verde Irrigation District , the Imperial Irrigation District and , most recently , from the dairy farm of state Assemblyman Rusty Areias , D-Salinas , near Los Banos . <p> Water marketing also got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emergency by creating a state water bank , which has purchased hundreds of thousands of acre-feet of water from farmers who fallowed their land or switched to groundwater . Water prices in the range of $ 100 to $ 200 per acre-foot give many farmers a 100 percent profit on their water while supplying urban users at far less cost than reclamation schemes . <p> Greater use of markets to allocate water may help California 's water flow more freely to thirsty customers who are willing to pay top dollar . But the implication of Moody 's study is that Californians will have to see lush green farms , and some communities that surround them , return to their original condition as deserts . <p> DEBT CRISIS REVISITED ? <p> A new World Bank study lists 32 countries that qualify as financial basket cases  --  or , in officialese , " severely indebted low-income countries . " Most are in Africa , including Somalia and Rwanda . Spending at least twice the value of their exports each year on principal and interest , they must finance a good portion of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Most people think that aside from these extreme cases , the " debt crisis " of the 1980s is history . Not so , say Michael Dooley and Kenneth Kletzer of the University of California at Santa Cruz and Eduardo Fernandez-Arias of the World Bank . Authors of a recent study of finances in the developing world , they conclude that lower world interest rates , not internal fiscal or economic reforms , were chiefly responsible for bailing out big debtor nations such as Brazil that once teetered on the edge of bankruptcy . <p> The implication , they say , is that the debt crisis is only sleeping , not dead . Since these countries , such as Argentina , Brazil and Venezuela , remain serious credit risks , new loans and investment to them would slow if interest rates rose , and they would " probably again experience debt servicing difficulties . " <p> With interest rates around the world soaring this year , " the pace of capital inflows has slowed dramatically " to the Third World , said Dooley , putting development plans at risk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show that developing countries imported capital at an annual rate of $ 98 billion in the fourth quarter of last year , when rates were low . But as rates have climbed , their borrowing shrank to an annual rate of only $ 59 billion by the second quarter of this year .
