<p> WITH the Wall Street money machine suddenly in turmoil , New Yorkers might increasingly see their economic salvation in unfashionable places like Varick Street . Made up largely of older brick industrial buildings just three or four subway stops from the world 's financial center , the area is a key part of the city 's $3 billion printing industry . <p> Yet there is growing apprehension among Varick Street printers . As rents soar in surrounding areas , many of them fear they will soon be forced to find new homes farther from their clients in Manhattan 's flourishing media , arts , business-services and financial industries . <p> " Fewer and fewer people feel they can remain in Manhattan , said Stuart Leventhal , executive vice president of Empire Graphics on Varick Street , the sole New York City manufacturer on last year 's Inc. magazine list of the nation 's 500 fastest-growing private companies . " There 's a feeling that the real estate interests do n't want printers and related businesses around . " <p> These fears have been compounded by recent announcements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the real estate arm of Trinity Church , that many leases with printers will not be renewed . In the trade publication Printing News , Steve Heyman , director of commercial leasing at Trinity Real Estate , suggested that Trinity wanted to move out companies it considered too noisy , too dirty and too smelly . <p> Mr. Heyman said in a subsequent interview that some printers , particularly those using the latest desktop technology , could remain in the district because they did not offend more conventional office clients . In the last decade , he added , many printers have failed to make payments , moved out or closed up shop . By retrofitting the buildings for office tenants , he said , Trinity can gain a more stable client base and charge rents that are two or three times those now paid by printers . <p> Varick Street is emblematic of the continuing struggle to preserve economic diversity in a city increasingly dominated by one sector  --  financial services . Although New York has long served as the nation 's financial capital , recent studies show that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has reached new , perhaps alarming , levels . <p> In the bull market of the 1980 's , according to a recent report by H. Carl McCall , the New York State Comptroller , Wall Street accounted for 23 percent of the city 's income growth . In the bull market of this decade , the financial sector has contributed 56 percent of the earnings increase . <p> As the Wall Street expansions of the 1960 's did , the recent boom has energized the city 's economy . But it has driven up real estate costs for industrial companies as developers and landlords try to lure more upscale tenants . A recent survey of manufacturers by the New York Industrial Retention Network found that more than half the manufacturers in Brooklyn , Queens , the Bronx and Staten Island thought real estate costs had increased significantly in the last year ; in Manhattan , 77 percent of the manufacturers agreed . <p> SUCH real estate pressures , said Fred Levine , chairman of the Industrial Technology Assistance Corporation and president of Marcus &; Wiesen , a garment maker in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs from 1992 to 1997 . Even successful executives like Mr. Leventhal blame the administration of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani for pursuing zoning policies and subsidies that favor housing , offices and high-profile retailers at the expense of small manufacturers . <p> But Joseph B. Rose , chairman of the City Planning Commission , disputed the notion that City Hall is biased against manufacturers . He said regulatory changes and tax cuts had helped create more than 4,000 mostly small-scale manufacturing companies , which he saw as representative of the future of New York 's industrial economy . <p> " Our goal is to do nothing that displaces viable manufacturing districts , but you ca n't solve every problem , " he said . " We ca n't tell a landlord what he can do with a commercial lease . " He added that many of the lower-level jobs lost in manufacturing could be made up by the retail and tourism sectors . And the media , computer and business-services companies now found in the space abandoned by printers and blue-collar industries also diversify and enrich the economy , he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is part of a process that began four decades ago . <p> After World War II , New York City was one of the world 's most diverse industrial economies , with roughly a million workers . Its factories made everything from steel pipe and machine parts to furniture , books , brochures , light fixtures and apparel . <p> Fernand Braudel , the late French historian , noted that these small businesses , most employing less than 30 people and often clustered by industry in areas like Varick Street , offered customers almost instant delivery of specialty goods in ways that would be impossible for more remote suppliers in less diverse economies . He and others contended that these sectors helped cushion boom-and-bust cycles . <p> But by the 1960 's , New York 's industrial sector really began to shrink , as companies fled the city 's high taxes and land costs . Today , manufacturing employment is roughly 260,000 , a quarter of the level of the immediate post-war period . And in the last quarter-century , the deterioration has accelerated ; in apparel , the largest New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a third as many as in the mid-70 's . <p> Some people , including Robert Fitch , an urban economist at New York University , say the shrinkage has contributed to the city 's growing income inequality which , according to a recent study by the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities , a research center in Washington , is now the widest in the nation . Although not as high-paying as jobs in securities , media and other elite sectors , New York 's dwindling manufacturing jobs pay more than $39,000 a year , on average  --  20 percent more than hotel work and nearly twice as much as retail jobs . <p> OF course , New York is not the only city that has seen a precipitous fall in industrial employment . Between 1978 and 1997 , manufacturing jobs in the nation basically stagnated at roughly 16 million . But in urban centers , the number of such jobs fell from 4.1 million , to 1.6 million , according to the Industrial Technology Institute , a research center in Ann Arbor , Mich . <p> But in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Los Angeles , industrial employment has been growing . Houston , for example , has added a total of roughly 20,000 industrial jobs the last three years . Although much of the growth is connected to the petrochemical and refining industries , the city has also seen gains in food processing , machine tools and transportation equipment . <p> Bill Gilmer , an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Houston , traces this resurgence , which followed precipitous declines in the 1980 's oil bust , to two important factors : the development of highly concentrated expertise in the energy sector and an immigration trend that has provided motivated labor and entrepreneurial zeal . Houston 's success can also be traced to its relatively low taxes , low real estate costs and business-friendly attitude . <p> Los Angeles , though , seems more relevant to New York . Los Angeles County , the region 's urban core , also has relatively high taxes and real estate costs . But after a sharp decline in manufacturing jobs at the end of the cold war , it has rebounded , becoming the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added roughly 30,000 industrial jobs since 1995 . <p> Interestingly , Los Angeles 's current manufacturing economy parallels the old New York model of small , highly diverse companies . It has seen job growth in food processing , metals , bicycle parts , furniture and aerospace . But perhaps most significant has been the growth in the apparel and textile sectors , which have added more than 15,000 jobs since 1995 . <p> While some people trace the growth of Los Angeles manufacturing to its big pool of low-wage workers , including many illegal aliens , similar conditions exist in many other cities , including New York . More important may be the development of dense networks of supplier firms , designers and a wealth of aggressive entrepreneurs , including many immigrants from Asia , Latin America , the Middle East and North Africa . <p> Nowhere is this more pronounced than in downtown Los Angeles . Once largely filled with unoccupied , dilapidated factories and warehouses , the area has seen industrial vacancy rates drop to the low single digits . <p> To Orly Dehan , president of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppliers and other essential services that makes downtown Los Angeles such an appealing industrial area . Designers , factories and factors  --  the financial middlemen between manufacturers and retailers  --  are within a 10-minute walk or drive of one another , explained Mr. Dehan , who came to Los Angeles via Montreal and Morocco in the early 1980 's . <p> " When I go to New York , " he said , " you can sell in Manhattan , but the factories are in Pennsylvania . " <p> PROXIMITY is precisely why companies like Empire Graphics  --  which employs 60 people , mostly members of minorities  --  prefer to stay in places like Varick Street . Like other bastions of New York manufacturing , including custom furniture and food processing , printers thrive on close interaction with customers , suppliers and , perhaps most important , with one another . Indeed , despite real estate prices that are often at least 50 percent higher than in the outer boroughs , most of the city 's fastest-growing industrial companies continue to cluster in Manhattan or in places like Long Island City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All this may seem out of place in an era of instantaneous global communication , but such face-to-face links are still important . <p> " Our customers do n't want to spend money and time to check the work we 're doing for them , " Mr. Leventhal said . " They want to be able to walk , get in the cab or subway to check the proofs . When push comes to shove , the ability to be local and close  --  to see what 's going on  --  is more important than being in the global village . That 's why we 're still here . "
