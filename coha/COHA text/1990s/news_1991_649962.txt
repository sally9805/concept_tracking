##@x <p> The Economist of London reports on the United States with more care and insight than any other foreign journal  --  or most American papers . When it analyzes a large subject , it speaks with the sympathy of a friend but the detachment of a realist . <p> In the current issue The Economist has an extended article on blacks in America . It summarizes its conclusions in this statement : <p> " America is riding high on a wave of post-Gulf confidence , but one part of the country is still missing out : the poverty-ridden ghettos where millions of black Americans live . George Bush can not afford to ignore them . " <p> During the Persian Gulf war , some of us wondered aloud why it was that the United States could bring so much energy and commitment to war and so little , comparatively , to domestic problems . A President who had fumbled or avoided challenges at home was utterly decisive in the gulf conflict . An inert public became engaged . <p> Such comment was dismissed on the political right as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not so easy thus to dismiss The Economist , a magazine with a conservative outlook that expressed few doubts about the war . <p> The survey of black America begins with some statistics . They are familiar but still chilling . <p> The unemployment rate for blacks last year was 10.5 percent , twice that of whites . The leading cause of death among young black men in America is murder . By the official definition of poverty , 43 percent of black children are born poor . Two-thirds of black babies are born to unmarried mothers . <p> There is also a great black success story . In the last 30 years a black middle class has developed , growing from a tenth to more than a third of the black population . <p> The Economist does not explore how that happened , but it was undoubtedly the result at least in part of the removal of racial barriers . Blacks are welcome now in law firms and banks and other places where they were hardly ever seen before . <p> But while a middle class has grown , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale . About a third of all blacks live below the poverty line , a proportion unchanged for 20 years . An underclass made up in considerable part of blacks lives in decayed areas of America 's inner cities . <p> One feature of ghetto life has grown strikingly worse in the last generation . The old Harlem had among its residents lawyers and businessmen and other leading figures : role models for the young and poor . Now they have virtually all left for desegregated middle-class neighborhoods . <p> That point was first made to me by Roger Wilkins , who contrasted growing up among authentic leaders as he did with the hopelessness and crime that are pervasive today . The Economist quotes William Julius Wilson of the University of Chicago to the same effect . <p> Poor inner-city neighborhoods , Professor Wilson says , now lack even the basic social models of responsibility and work . There are few jobs available , and vogue ideas such as enterprise zones seem to have little lasting effect . <p> The ghettos are a world apart , its young people growing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they deeply affect that mainstream , the quality of urban life , the economics of our cities and states . We are all in the same country . <p> Liberal and conservative Americans , white and black , probably agree more than they realize now on how to approach the daunting problems of the ghetto . Most would put more emphasis on jobs and job training and work incentives . Most would reject the ideas of black separatism . Most would do more for the health of poor children , and for their education in ways that work , like Head Start . <p> Why , then , is there no national commitment to fight the ills of the ghetto and the underclass ? It can not just be a shortage of money ; we found money for the gulf war . It can not be that wars have more definite objectives and neater endings ; we are finding out in Iraq what a delusion that is . <p> No , the reason we do so little about our greatest domestic problem is a lack of political will : of courage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friend abroad . Here is the way the Economist article ends : <p> " The slums in America 's great cities are shameful . They are a damning indictment of the richest country in the world . The problems that fester in them are not peripheral ; they constitute America 's main domestic challenge today . . . . <p> " George Bush could now cash in on the country 's post-war confidenceby launching another war on the black home-front . America can not afford to let down its blacks for much longer .

He wants to watch Cars but the DVD player is broken . " I stifled a laugh . <p> " You 're hilarious .

NO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Jake rocked forward again thanks to Li'l Mikey 's short and fat toddler legs .

" <p> We heard rustling and Li'l Mikey silently chewed for a moment , until we heard what sounded like marbles dropping on the ground as all of his M&amp;Ms dropped to the floor . <p> " WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA ! " <p> " Can I start screaming , too ? " Jake asked me pathetically . <p> I opened my carry- on , pulled out four Tylenols and a Gatorade , and handed them to Jake , who wordlessly gulped it all down .

" Wrong , " he said , his eyes still shut . " This is God punishing us for sneering at the parents whose kid was screaming in the restaurant last night . It 's like Dante 's Inferno , except with annoying children and mothers instead of hornets and wasps . " <p> " Oh , please . They absolutely deserved to get kicked out of the restaurant . I mean , it 's somewhat difficult to enjoy a fifty- dollar steak when Junior next to me is screaming ' Fie truck ! Fie truck ! ' " <p> " I agree .

Jake did n't seem to appreciate it . <p> He also did not appreciate when I laughed so hard I choked on my birth control pill . <p> " You think this is hilarious , but I 'm the one who has to give a presentation on Logitech 's new software application to about fifty executives tomorrow , " he whispered as he fiddled with his wedding band . <p> I smiled at him . " Maybe you should bring Mikey as your secret weapon . " <p> " What , like , ' If you do n't buy our product , I 'll give the kid a Jolt cola and turn him loose in your employee break room ' ?

I ca n't <p> wait to read the next entry , " she said , then gave a small wave and disappeared into the mass of people in the terminal . <p> " She was sweet , " I said to Jake . <p> " Yep . Thanks again for writing about my accident . " <p> " No problem . " <p> " Which way 's baggage claim ? " <p> " I think to the left . " I pointed .

Sam wo n't hesitate to use her Tiffany heart bracelet as a weapon if pissed off . " <p> In the car after we collected our bags , Sam began to rant . " Holy shit !

She threw it into the backseat , narrowly missing Jake 's right temple . " So what the eff took you so long ? I had to go around the airport forever and this ginormously obese policeman kept blowing his whistle thingy at me . " <p> " Sorry . We were at baggage claim for a while . The airline lost one of our bags . " <p> Oh , but Rosemary and her baby sure got their bags promptly . <p> Jake leaned forward from the backseat and whispered , " What does ' emo ' mean ? " " How should I know ? I do n't speak teenager , " I hissed at him . Sam 's blue eyes narrowed as she sized me up . " Did you guys get fatter over the weekend or something ? You look all puffy .

It 's called sarcasm , ever heard of it ? " <p> Assuming her question was rhetorical , I glanced back at Jake with a slightly amused smile .

Oh , whoops , " she said as she swerved away from a parked car . <p> " Pay attention , OK ? I do n't want to die in a massive pileup . Besides , I think this hangover is enough to kill me . " <p> She opened her mouth to retort , but the Blackeyed Peas ' " Do n't Phunk With My Heart " started blaring in the backseat and she reached behind her to grab her phone while cruising through a red light and nearly ramming into an open car door . <p> Jake handed her the phone and the last thing I heard before I drifted off was " Yeah , yeah , yeah . Totally . So fugly . " <p> I jolted awake when we reached my parents ' house and Sam flattened the newspaper in the driveway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , and jerked her head , her palette earrings swishing back and forth . <p> My parents were inside , putting away groceries . Sam immediately went upstairs to her room to lie down from the extreme effort it took to drive us home . <p> " Welcome home ! " my mom shouted , her head halfway in the fridge . <p> " Hey ! There they are ! The two Vegas whales ! " my dad said , slapping Jake on the back . <p> " Oh , right . We 're up two hundred bucks . I 'd hardly call us whales , " I said . <p> " You two want a beer ? " my dad asked . <p> " No way . I 've had enough beer for a while , " Jake said , pointedly grabbing a bottle of water from the fridge as my mom closed it . <p> " We 're so hungover , " I moaned , and laid my head down on the kitchen island . <p> " Three Tylenols , flat soda with lots of ice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the dog . You know this stuff . Did n't I teach you anything ? " My mom thrust a two- liter bottle of Coke in front of me . <p> " Mom , this hangover is impervious to the effects of caffeine or sugar . It 's like I 'm dying . " <p> " What the hell did you expect to feel like after coming home from Vegas ? " <p> " Like shit . She 's just whining , " Jake said . <p> " Has your sinus infection gotten any better ? " my mom asked . <p> " The horse- pill antibiotics cleared it right up . Now , instead of my head exploding from sinus pressure , it 's throbbing due to the virtual bottle of vodka I drank last night . " <p> " That one , my dear , is your own fault . No sympathy here . And stop complaining , you 're not the one who has to get up at the crack of dawn tomorrow to make a six a.m. flight , " my mom said while trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fridge . <p> " Flying out ?

I 'll be gone all week so your father has to wrangle Sam himself . I know he has a couple of late meetings so keep your phone on in case she needs to get ahold of you . " <p> " When are you going to realize she 's seventeen and not six ? " <p> " When I stop watching my oldest daughter 's cat while she 's getting drunk in Vegas over the weekend . " <p> " Funny . Hey , guess what ? A fan recognized me at the airport , " I said . <p> " That 's so great , honey ! Your last blog entry was hysterical . Very funny . How 's the car , Jake ?

" <p> " Let 's go , " my dad said , and they walked into the other room to commandeer the big- screen television and watch what ever game was referenced . <p> " Staying for dinner ? " <p> " Of course . Free meals taste the best . What are we having ? " <p> " Pepperoni , sausage , and cheese . " <p> " Is Mark coming ? " <p> " No . He 's staying in the city . It 's one of his roommates ' birthdays . " She paused . " At least , I think that 's what he said . I think it 's just an excuse to go out on a Sunday night . " " Mom , when you 're twenty- two you do n't need an excuse . The <p> fact you 're legally allowed to drink in bars still has some luster . " " Just as long as he does n't end up in the gutter somewhere . " " Clearly you have n't heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to eat pizza an hour later , I watched as Sam picked at the cheese on her plate , not daring to touch the crust for fear of osmotically ingesting a carb . She felt me watching her and snapped her head in my direction and narrowed her eyes . " Do you know your cat is gay ? " <p> " What ? " I said . Jake choked a little on his pizza . <p> " Your . Cat . Gay . Did you know ? " <p> " What is she talking about ? " I turned to my parents . <p> My father had an amused smile on his face . <p> " What ? " I asked him . <p> " Oh . Nothing . I have no idea what she 's talking about , " he said . <p> " Mom ? " <p> " Well , let 's just say Butterscotch is very interested in women 's fashion . " " Huh ? " " We came home from dinner the other night and  --  " " No ! Let me tell the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and your totally weird cat was all bored while you were in Vegas and we were stuck watching him . Did you know he is so fat and afraid of everything ? " Sam said . <p> " Point ? " <p> " Jeez , relax , psycho . I was n't done yet . Way to interrupt me . Anyway , he went into everyone 's rooms while we were gone and brought stuff downstairs and left it on the kitchen floor . Like presents or something . He brought down your old ugly frilly prom dress , mom 's gross black underwear , and my thongs . Mom and Dad came home with the Andersons and tried to explain why there was lingerie and weird crap all over the kitchen . " She took a swig of her water and sat back in her chair , arms crossed . <p> " Seriously ? " I said , and looked back and forth . " Unfortunately , " my dad said . " It was pretty difficult trying to blame all of that on the cat . " " Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andersons any time soon . They left pretty quickly , " my mom said . <p> " I 'm so sorry , he 's never done  --  , " I started to say . <p> " Do n't worry about it . Like I said , maybe he 's just interested in fashion , " my mom said . <p> " Why could n't you have a cat that was interested in normal fashion , like Citizen Jeans or something , rather than ugly nineties prom dresses and lingerie ? Your cat is a freak show . " <p> As if on cue , we heard the unmistakable sound of Butterscotch howling . We all froze and looked at each other , cautious smiles on our faces . We waited , silent and still , as the howling got louder . I took a sharp breath in and my mom elbowed me to be quiet . Butterscotch rounded the corner into the kitchen , dragging Sam 's hot pink , sparkly feather boa from Halloween behind him . <p> We jumped up and cheered and Sam let out a snort . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that cat has serious problems . He is so freaking annoying . Are n't you like totally embarrassed to be associated with him ? " she said , turning to me . <p> " Not really . I 've been associated with you for seventeen years . I 'll get used to it . " <p> " You 're such a loser . Just like your cat , " she said , and stomped off , wrenching the boa from Butterscotch , who looked confused that his latest present was n't gratefully accepted . <p> I turned to Jake , who looked positively thrilled . <p> " This . Is . So . Awesome . That cat can stay , " he said . <p> 1:00 A.M. <p> Finally , back at our apartment , gay cat and all , I opened my computer and checked my blog 's comments . I yelled to Jake in the bedroom , " Wifey1025 offered to drive you to work tomorrow if your car is n't fixed yet . " <p> " Thanks . Tell her I prefer to get hacked into little pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will do , " I told him as I walked into the bedroom . I jumped into our fluffy marshmallow bed and snuggled underneath the comforter . " How great does it feel to get in bed ? " I asked him , my face buried in a pillow . <p> " Pretty damn good , " he said , and stretched his arms over his head . <p> " I know , but Jake ? " I poked him in his ribs . <p> " Yeah ? " <p> " I 'm kinda hungry again , " I said , and smiled at him . <p> " Jesus , we just ate a few hours ago . " He flipped on the television . <p> " I know , but it 's the hangover . I 've gone from extreme nausea to ravenous hunger pains . My body is finally ready to accept food . There 's all that leftover pizza my mom gave us . " <p> " OK , fine , " he said as he casually turned off the television . He slowly sat up in bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he yelled as he scrambled out of bed and nearly trucked over Butterscotch lying in the doorjamb . <p> " NOT COOL ! " I yelled as I chased after him . <p> He got to the kitchen first and yanked out the pizza box so forcefully the leftover slices slid out onto the floor . <p> " Nice going , " I laughed . <p> He looked at me and shrugged . " Ten- second rule ? " <p> We both paused and smirked at each other before diving onto the floor and trying to salvage the slices not covered in cat hair . We leaned against the kitchen cabinets and silently munched on the cold pizza . <p> " Leftover pizza is nothing short of amazing , " I mumbled as I wiped pizza sauce off my mouth . <p> " I 'll show you amazing . " Jake smiled wickedly at me as he took the pizza crust from my hand . <p> " Kitchen floor ? I do n't think so . When 's the last time we actually cleaned this thing ? Actually , have we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to grab the crust back . <p> " Probably not . Who cares ? Let 's have fun . " <p> " Well . . . what the hell , " I said , and allowed him to pull me closer . <p> We did n't get back to bed until almost two in the morning . I 'm sure I 'll be exhausted tomorrow and find cat hair and dust in some very interesting places , but as Jake said , " Who cares ? " We have n't even been married a year  --  we 're still newlyweds . We can have sex on the kitchen floor until the crack of dawn while eating leftovers , right ? By my calculations we only have a few more years to do things like that , so we might as well take advantage . <p> Excerpted from A Bump in the Road by Maureen Lipinski .
