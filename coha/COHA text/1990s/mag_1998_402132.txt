New U.S. guidelines identify 29 million more Americans as tempting fate with their weight // Extra pounds are nothing to make light of . Just ask the 29 million Americans who became overweight overnight last June , when the government revised medical guidelines . " It is a problem-we 're the fattest nation in the world , " says the author of the guidelines , Dr. Xavier Pi-Sunyer , 64 , chairman of the National Heart , Lung and Blood Institute task force of the National Institutes of Health . The new guidelines use a ratio of weight to height to determine a person 's Body Mass Index ( BMI ) - divide your weight in pounds by your height in inches squared , then multiply by 704.5 . Under the old guidelines , a BMI of 27.8 or higher for men and 27.3 or higher for women indicated a weight problem . The new rules lower the cutoff to 25 for both sexes . Why the change ? After consulting health experts and reviewing exhaustive studies , " the task force found that there is a higher risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explains Pi-Sunyer , citing as an example the increased likelihood that an overweight person has of developing diabetes . Still , not everyone is convinced . Judith S. Stern , professor of nutrition at the University of California at Davis and a member of the American Obesity Association , says that health risks are n't serious until one reaches a BMI of 27 and that the new charts fail to take into consideration muscle mass , which is heavy but not unhealthy . Personally , Pi-Sunyer , a six-foot Manhattan resident who is married ( to Penelope , a social worker ) and the father of three grown children , weighs in at 168 pounds and keeps his BMI at about 23 by going light on snacks and exercising daily . He even walks 28 blocks to and from his office . " That 's a 40-minute total walk , and walking is a good source of energy expenditure , " he says . PiSunyer spoke to PEOPLE contributor Frances Hong about the obesity guidelines . Photograph " It 's not a crisis but an epidemic , " says Dr. Xavier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York City ) of obesity in America . // What should someone do if he or she has a high BMI ? Those between 25 and 30 BMI should avoid gaining any more weight , and try to keep closer to 25 . If the BMI is 30 or higher , the patient needs to try to lose 10 percent of his or her present weightand not through a crash diet , which can be very hard on one 's body . The safe amount of time that it takes to lose that 10 percent is six months , or no more than 4 pounds a month . What are the potential health problems of being overweight ? Part of the problem is that Americans do n't always associate obesity with health problems . But obesity can cause gall bladder problems , pulmonary osteoarthritis , heart disease , diabetes , hypertension and certain kinds of cancer . We 're moving people into the obese class of 30-plus BMI at an astounding rate of 1 percent a year . How can doctors help ? Being overweight is no different from having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patients that obesity is a risk factor for disease and convince them to get more exercise and eat less . People can add a significant number of years to their lives if their BMI remains under 25 . But critics say BMI fails to take muscle weight into consideration . Yes , they say that people over 25 BMI are not " overfat " but " overmuscular . " But athletic people who are very muscular represent a small percentage of the population . They also train and see their physicians regularly . But the huge majority of Americans are sedentary , and normally they gain half a pound to 1 pound each year from age 20 to age 60 . How much fatter is the average American now than , say , 20 or 40 years ago ? In a 1962 health examination survey by the government , for the 30-plus BMI group , 10 percent of men and 15 percent of women were obese . Compare that with 1994 , when almost 20 percent of men and 25 percent of women hit that mark . Photograph Arnold Schwarzenegger 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Olympic form , skier Picabo Street is borderline hefty at 25.1 . Though sometimes cited for pudginess , Kate Winslet boasts a mere 2t BMI. // Why do Americans have weight problems ? Forty percent of the problem of obesity is genetic and 60 percent is environment . The environment comes with the availability and palatability of food-it 's tasty and cheap . Generally we eat too much , and the portions are too large . Also , we eat all the time . We 're a snacking nation . If you go around the world , you 'll see that a lot of nations do n't eat between meals , have less fast food available and often treat meals as a social affair . Are there healthy snacks ? Apples , pears and oranges are good and provide vitamin A and carotene ; potato sticks , pretzels and carrots are also good . Actually it is wrong to talk about good foods versus bad foods . Cheese , for example , is a good food and has a lot of calcium , which you need . Most foods , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just need to cut back on portions . A little chocolate wo n't hurt you , but a pound of chocolate in one day is certainly bad . Is dieting enough ? No . Americans are incredibly sedentary . We drive everywhere ; we take the escalators , not the stairs ; we have beautiful lawns , but we hire someone else to mow them . Today , 2 percent of Americans are farmers and the rest sit behind desks all day long . I recommend 30 to 40 minutes a day of walking or exercise . The very minimum that people at any age should do is walk . How does the US. population compare with others ? Traditionally , most of the Asian nations are much leaner-Indonesia , Thailand , India , China and Japan , to name a few . They tend to have lowfat diets that are high in carbohydrates , particularly rice . Their populations also tend to be more active . For instance , they do n't drive everywhere . They walk or take bicycles . But even there , there has been some change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afford more food , sometimes cars and even televisions . So prosperity can be a mixed blessing ? True . Some of the fatter nations are among the most wealthy , like Austria , Germany , Australia and the United Kingdom . Do other countries rely on the same guidelines we do ? Absolutely . In fact , we 've come into compliance with the rest of the world . Essentially all the countries have adopted the World Health Organization guidelines . Is it safe to use drugs to lose weight ? I 'm not for or against any kind of weight-loss programs or diets . Refer to the Food and Drug Administration-they 're the ones who approve certain drugs for safe weight loss . But even then , you should remember that there is no drug on the market that has been tested for use longer than a year . Is there such a thing as a dangerously low BMI ? Below 18.5 is abnormal . This is common with anorexic patients or smokers and can present problems such as lowered resistance to infectious agents , which can lead to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In controlling your own BMI , do you have any weaknesses ? Nuts . I like peanuts , almonds , cashews . Yes , they are indeed high in fat content , but I control myself . I eat just a few at a time . // A Weighty Issue Revisited " This is for all the fat girls ! " shouted The Practices Camryn Manheim , BMI 38 , at the Emmys. // <p>
