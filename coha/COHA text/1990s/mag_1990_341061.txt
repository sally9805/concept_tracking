When James Nachtwey graduated from Dartmouth in 1970 , he did n't have a career mapped out . So he traveled around the world . Perhaps because the bloodshed in Vietnam was at its height , he became fascinated with war . He taught himself photography and spent hours staring at scenes of conflict in art books and at exhibitions . " Those pictures had the greatest emotional impact on me , " Nachtwey recalls . " It seemed to me the most worthwhile thing one could do with a camera . " <P> In 1980 Nachtwey quit his job as a photographer for a New Mexico newspaper and went to Northern Ireland . Since then he has photographed 15 wars and civil conflicts , winning numerous prizes for his work . That 's why he was the natural choice to accompany senior correspondent Alessandra Stanley on a four-nation journey for this week 's story on child warriors . <P> Nachtwey has never become jaded by war , which helps explain why his photographs are so powerful . " You 're never the same , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awareness of something very dark and cruel that you have to carry with you always . You pay a price , you carry the weight , you lose sleep . " To convey that sensibility to others , Nachtwey published a remarkable volume of photographs last year called Deeds of War . It was dedicated to all those who have " helped a stranger and asked for nothing in return . " <P> Journalists often depend on the goodwill of strangers . On assignment , Stanley and Nachtwey learned that Pakistani police were preventing foreigners from crossing the border into Afghanistan . Nachtwey began to grow a beard and donned guerrilla garb in order to pass through in a truck with a group of mujahedin . Stanley crawled into a burlap bag and hid among sacks filled with wheat . " On the one hand , I was scared , " she recalls . " On the other hand , I felt absurd . " On the way back , Stanley rode openly with the rebels , but dressed in a burka , a head-to-toe Muslim garment . All went smoothly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inches from our costumed journalists for a half-hour trip that seemed like an eternity . " He did n't suspect a thing , " says Nachtwey . " Otherwise we would have gone to jail . "
