MAUREEN BRILLA INVENTS IMAGINARY SPACES AS SHE CREATES HER MINIATURE OIL PAINTINGS <p> At first glance the paintings of Maureen Brilla may seem to be cheerful miniatures depicting sunlit rooms filled with brightly colored patterns . But first impressions can be misleading . Far more than just paintings of interiors , these are symbolic works as rich in imagination and concept as they are in detail . <p> So meticulous are the details in Brilla 's work , many people believe that she executes them using a magnifying glass , a device she has never employed . The paintings are tiny , most of them no more than , " x 10 " . But there is a world contained in each  --  a foreboding world of people and animals inhabiting mysterious spaces ) of surreal dreams and deceptively luminous nightmares . <p> The small scale of Brilla 's current work is a result of her search for a way to imbue her paintings with a sense intimacy , making their viewing a more contemplative experience . " I want them viewed one-on-one , " she says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get their own ideas from them . They 're not for viewing by masses of people all at once . " <p> Through her painstaking technique , Brilla attains a sense of accomplishment that she says she finds nowhere else in her life . " It has a lot to do with the American work ethic , " she says , "  --  the idea that you should put your all into everything you do . My personal idea of art is that it should offer something beyond mundane experience . I would like the process to reflect the dignity that can be found through hard work . " <p> Brilla believes that the control necessary to work so minutely takes the same sort of energy as creating large , painterly works because of the restraint involved in working in such a small scale . But she remarks , " I 'm not like my paintings at all . I 'm nervous and energetic . The paintings are the other side of me . It takes a lot of work to keep myself still . By doing the paintings , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an assistant professor of art at Nazareth College in Rochester , New York , has sold virtually every painting she has done in the past seven years . Her yearly output consists of only six to eight oil paintings and about fifteen watercolors . Brilla 's work is handled by the Oxford Gallery in Rochester . Her most recent exhibition was held last November at the Loft Gallery in Chicago . <p> On the wall of her apartment near Rochester 's lilac-rich Highland Park are posters of paintings by artists ranging from Vermeer to Grandma Moses . In cages are the subjects of some of her paintings  --  a blue-headed parrot and two cockatiels . And roaming the apartment are three cats . As in her paintings , Brilla packs a lot into a small space ; her studio occupies a few square feet in the corner of the living room . <p> Brilla was born in Berlin , Wisconsin , in 1954 . Her first formal art lessons were taken at the Art Institute of Chicago while she was a student at a convent school in that city . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her MA degree from the University of Indiana at Bloomington . While a student she painted with loose , more expressive brush strokes on canvases ranging up to 12 " x 15 " . <p> Brilla counts among her influences works by fifteenth-century Flemish painters Jan van Eyck , Rogier van der Weyden , and Robert Campin . In the paintings of Vermeer she admires the luminosity and sense of mystery surrounding common people involved in everyday tasks . But she also draws on the austerity of the Bauhaus ideals of balance , symmetry , and pure design . In terms of composition , she is inspired by the later works of Mondrian . <p> Brilla 's process invariably contains many steps , both conceptual and technical . When she began her painting The Sinking Feeling of Security Lost , she knew only that she wanted to paint a visual contradiction by placing a landscape in an interior . As her first stage in the demonstration shows , she originally planned to allow the viewer to see the entire landscape . But the result looked too illustrative to her and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's intimacy . So she decided to reveal only a segment of the landscape . <p> It was at that point that the image sparked a realization : Brilla wanted the painting to be about the dichotomy between the secure feeling of being inside and the often threatening feeling of being out in the world . A view of the naturally surreal area above the clouds , which is an unfamiliar , dreamlike territory , would serve to intensify the feeling of insecurity . <p> Typically , Brilla 's works change conceptually during the process of painting . Brilla believes in following spontaneous , intuitive ideas wherever they lead . She often works on more than one painting at a time so that ideas that come to her as she is working can best be incorporated into a work ; in this way , she avoids confusing the paintings ' content with inharmonious elements . " The painting talks to me , " she says . " It tells me what it needs . I 'm not afraid to wipe out two months ' worth of work in order to change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become more a craft than an art . " <p> When Brilla painted a doorway in Sinking Feeling of Security Lost , she was struck by a sensation of being in a sanctuary and the work took on a spiritual quality for her . She began to look for objects and colors that were reminiscent of her own religious experiences and came up with a heavy oak table , a mirror , and an arch-shaped window . At this point , the work was still open to changes . Brilla decided to transform the rectangular table into a round one so that it would reinforce the idea of infinity : a round shape has no beginning or end . Then she began to think of objects she could put in the mirror to denote trust . She thought of a friend whose pet bird allowed him to carry it around by its foot . She considered this to be extremely trusting of the bird , so she included her friend 's hand holding the bird in this manner as a somewhat personal symbol . Then she decided to place a fishbowl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feeling of uncertainty about the painting 's implied space , not to mention the bird 's fate . <p> Brilla does not use canvas . She paints on pieces of quarter-inch-thick , untempered Masonite , using pine one-by-twos attached with carpenter 's glue for backing to prevent warpage . She first sands off any small bumps on the Masonite to make it even but maintains a slightly toothy texture . She then applies a coat of full-strength rabbitskin glue , just as painters did in the Renaissance . She uses a sponge brush to paint on about twenty coats of gesso ( mixed in standard proportions ) , sanding between each layer until the surface is smooth . Because it takes about a week to complete a panel , she makes five at once , all the while working on another painting . <p> Before creating her preliminary drawing , Brilla finds the center of the panel so that she can place figures or objects in their appropriate positions according to their importance . She draws on the board with graphite , taking care not to press too hard and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but these never contain the complete image . <p> Brilla begins to paint her basic forms with oil paint thinned with turpentine , painting and repainting up to two dozen times . After the paint has begun to build up , she uses a mixture of one-third damar varnish , one-third stand oil , and one-third high-quality turpentine as her medium . To one quart of this medium , she adds ten drops of cobalt dryer . This mixture is added to her paint until she is ready to do her final sanding , at which point she switches to Winsor &; Newton 's opal medium . <p> As she progresses , Brilla paints more opaque coats . Before any final details are rendered , however , she sands the completely dry surface with superfine sandpaper , backing the paper with her fingers instead of a sanding block . She does this to eliminate traces of previous compositional changes that might be reflected when light hits the painting . She does not want thick , impasto brush strokes to show . It takes her an additional three weeks to finish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details . In the final stages , Brilla often uses transparent oil paint . For instance , she may glaze over pink and white flowers with a transparent purple hue . When finished , she applies a matte varnish . <p> Brilla uses only Winsor &; Newton Series 12 miniature sable brushes ( 000 to 2 ) . She says they 're the only ones she can count on not to lose their hair and not to splay . Because a brush lasts through only one painting , she spends about $800 per year for brushes . <p> Brilla 's references include wallpaper-pattern books , interior-design magazines , and real and imagined objects . The interiors in her works and the light sources that illuminate them are basically imagined . " I think of light as the presence of something more powerful than we are , " she says . I always think that there is something happening in a painting beyond what you see within its frame  --  as there is. in a larger sense , in existence . She never uses an artificial light source such as a light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her oil paintings ; they are done from still-life setups or from direct observation from nature . She uses 140-pound Arches hot-pressed paper and Schmincke and Winsor &; Newton watercolors . First , she makes a barely discernible graphite drawing consisting of rough geometric shapes that represent compositional elements . In terms of color , she responds intuitively to the scene or objects before building layer after layer over the course of about fifteen hours . Her watercolors serve a different function from her oils . " They teach me composition , " she says , "  --  how to paint positive and negative shapes . And they remind me about how color functions in nature . " <p> Brilla 's symbolism is both personal and universal . A recent painting about a past relationship that she has finally come to terms with depicts a mirror hanging above a black , marble table on which sit a bowl of grapes and two lemons in shot glasses . In the mirror can be seen a room with covered furniture . The most disquieting touches are two strangely incongruous shapes , also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoes ( their feet stick out from beneath the covering ) , we can see that they are female figures . The title of this work is Sour Grapes . <p> In another , more light-hearted work , a stream-of-consciousness painting entitled When Pigs Have Wings and Kites Do n't Fly , Brilla included anything that happened to enter her mind while she was painting . The piece is about happenstance itself and is purely visual ; it is devoid of underlying symbolism . In it viewers will find a room with a pig in a basket being held aloft by balloons a foot or so above the floor . Near it , on the floor , is a plate with an ice cream cone on it , and on a yellow table on one side , propped up on a sort of candy dish on a stem is a quarter of a watermelon . Outside the window is a cliff dropping off into a quarry . A stuffed bird ( a kite ) sits in an alcove on the back wall . <p> Amore personal painting , An Unrequited Love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying , " It 's like talking to a brick wall . " In this case , the landscape contains a brick wall with a chair facing it . On the chair is a bird , a red-footed booby in its mating stance , which is known as sky-pointing . <p> Finally , another painting , entitled The Anteroom , was prompted by the words of a dying friend who told Brilla that there really is a " light " ( an afterlife ) . In this work , spaces can be seen leading off along halfway with light et the end . Of the three little girls in the painting , the final one , seen only in silhouette , seems , judging by the shadow she casts on the floor , to have been transformed into an angel An incredibly detailed peacock symbolizing paradise in the afterlife occupies the front of the composition . This work , like her others , displays those qualities that make each of Brilla 's paintings a truly intimate and mysterious world . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Opposite page : Sour Grapes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Oxford Gallery , Rochester , New York . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Opposite page , top left : The Bath , 1987 , oil , 10 x 8 .
