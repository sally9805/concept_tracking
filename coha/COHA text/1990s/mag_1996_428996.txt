SEVERAL YEARS AGO I managed to acquire a 6-inch Newtonian reflector for a song . Not wanting to spend a lot for a mount either , I decided to build my own German equatorial from plumbing parts . I chose 2inch pipe fittings for reasonable rigidity and fashioned a tripod out of 2-by-4s . This telescope has a very good mirror , and soon I wanted to take pictures with it . The pipe mount was rugged and easy to use , but at first the idea of adding motors seemed downright silly . With shafts that screwed in and out as they turned , how could I attach a drive gear ? The pipe surfaces were n't perfectly round , let alone machined to any specific diameter . Then I got the idea for a sector-andribbon drive . A steel ribbon could pull tangentially along the rim of a circular sector on the polar shaft . With a nut joined to the ribbon 's other end and a motor to turn a screw engaging this nut , I could achieve extremely uniform rotation at the sector 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hard surface even wood . What appealed to me most was that this type of drive could be made with almost no machining . After some back-of-the-envelope calculations , I decided to use a 1/4-20 screw and 1/2-r.p.m. motor . To turn the telescope at one revolution per sidereal day , this combination requires a sector with a radius of 5.71 inches . A trip to the local lumber shop yielded a 1-by-12 board of red oak , a very hard wood . First I scribed my circular arc on this wood and cut out the shape roughly with a jigsaw . Not having a router , I placed a router bit in a hand drill , clamped the drill in a vise , and swept the sector past the router bit . During this operation the sector was simply nailed through its center to define the pivot point . Small amounts of material were trimmed off until the correct radius was reached . Finally I enlarged the central opening with a hole saw on a friend 's drill press . Extreme precision was not essential , as I planned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so it could be adjusted for trueness and separation . Because the pipe mount had no shaft passing through a housing , the drive had to go on the upper ( north ) side of the polar axis along with the telescope itself . The sector rotates in a plane parallel to a larger board that carries the motor , screw , and traveling nut . Special guides were needed for routing the ribbon to present it properly to the traveling nut and screw . I planned the locations of all these parts in advance with the help of a 1-to-1 scale model on matte board . If a ribbon is going to pass over turning wheels , they must be very accurately made and mounted . Static guides are more forgiving , as they need only let the ribbon move freely . My experience suggested that metal would slide very smoothly on guides fashioned from a polyethylene cutting board . So I joined two thicknesses of poly , cut out a disk with a hole saw , and turned it to a pulley shape with the drill . Sawing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two ribbon guides . Photograph Thomas Wright of Oak Park , Illinois , proves that you do n't need a machine shop to build a rugged , motor-driven mount for deep-sky photography . His ingredients were some off-the-shelf pipe fittings , hand tools , minimal cash outlay , and ingenuity . Wright supplied all the photographs for this article . // The ribbon is the take-up spring from a 12-foot Stanley tape measure . It is smooth , thin , and 1/2 inch wide . I selected the end that was less tightly coiled . This ribbon glides against poly with very little friction and can bend into tight curves as needed . The drive screw is a 1/4 - 20 threaded rod from my local hardware store . These rods are usually quite straight , with threads accurate to better than 0.0001 inch because they are rolled between dies in manufacture . One end was turned down to the diameter of the motor coupling , and the other was turned to a conical point so it could sit in a cup of polyethylene for a thrust bearing . For these operations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I needed was a , inch brass bushing to constrain the free end of the screw while I worked on it with a file . Incidentally , in How to Make A Telescope ( Willmann-Bell , 1984 ) Jean Texereau also describes a ribbon-and-sector drive . He suggests a fancier thrust bearing , made by turning a cavity in the end of the screw . A small steel ball , set in this cavity , bears against another screw on the other side . The latter can serve as a slow-motion control during star tracking . But to make this cavity would require a real lathe rather than a makeshift one . Photograph One end of the author 's tape-measure ribbon is permanently attached to the wooden sector on the polar shaft at upper left . Two polyethylene guides ( white semicircles ) redirect this ribbon so it can be pulled by a motor-driven screw . A clever feature of the author 's drive is the guitar-string cable that takes up slack in the ribbon . One end is tied to the sector and the other to the traveling nut . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cable through the sheath , exposing more of the cable 's other end at the sector . // After shaping the ends of the drive screw I lapped its threads by applying fine valve-grinding compound and running the nut backward and forward while turning the screw with a reversible drill . For the motor coupling , I cut a piece of 3/8-inch plain rod and had a friend bore it to the correct diameter . The ribbon must be coupled to the nut so the screw is n't tugging it off center . So I made a long box that carries the nut at one end and joins to the ribbon at the other ( see the illustrations on the facing page ) . There is a cutout in which this box nestles to prevent it from twisting . With tension on the ribbon the nut stays firmly in its socket . While Texereau suggests using a small counterweight to pull on the ribbon and provide tension , I opted for a sheathed cable instead . As shown in the diagram , one end of the cable is fastened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This cable " closes the loop , " maintaining tension when the telescope is slewed . This way the ribbon is never at risk of bunching or kinking . At first I tried a bicycle brake cable , but it produced a large periodic error about every 2 seconds . The cause was the individual strands of the twisted cable bumping across the end of the sheath . So I replaced the stranded cable with a nickel-plated steel guitar string 0.020 inch thick . Quite strong , it eliminated the 2-second error completely . My first attempt at an end bearing for the screw was a bushing and collar , but these also became a source of error . The motor end of the screw is now supported by the motor alone . No bearing is needed , as there are no significant loads on this end of the screw . It is a good idea to have a cutoff switch in the path of the screw , so the drive wo n't self-destruct if one forgets and leaves it running too long . My switch is mounted on a short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly after it stops . This allows the nut to be lifted out of its socket and spun back . I do n't have to wait until the screw has traveled its full distance to reset it . I 've found this drive quite easy to use . Because the pipe nipple that acts as a polar shaft has two threaded ends , one is always coupled to the sector and the other is free , allowing unhindered movement . There seems to be very little backlash in the drive . I do n't have to wait more than a few seconds ( if at all ) for it to engage after repositioning the scope . The first photographic tests of the drive error , like that at upper left , showed a very smooth periodic error with a duration of two minutes and a deviation of +/-15 arcseconds . By spinning the drive screw I could see that it was crooked at the motor-shaft coupling by almost 1/8 inch . After this problem was corrected , the error was just +/-8 arcseconds . Yet this experience shows how forgiving of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the worm of a typical gear drive had a runout of 1/8 inch ! ) I should add a few brief words about the mount itself The first component at the bottom is a 2-inch flange bolted to the tripod head . Into this is threaded a short extension to elevate the head away from the tripod for clearance . A 45deg elbow defines the polar axis , as this is fairly close to my latitude .

A pipe tee serves as a declination housing and another 3-inch nipple as the declination shaft , whose upper end is connected through a flange to the telescope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a length of pipe to carry the counterweight . In a mount like this , all moving pipe threads should be lapped with valvegrinding compound . I found that black lithium grease , intended for injection into grease fittings , allows smooth movement with no starting friction . On the whole , the mount responds well to hand slewing , with only modest overshooting or backlash . The nipples serving as polar and declination shafts turn freely on the threads at either end . The declination tangent arm turns with the telescope , so it does not interfere with repositioning the telescope . This arm clamps to the pipe with set screws , so it can flex up or down slightly as needed when the cradle screws in or out on its threads . To avoid resetting the declination control very often , I made provision for very long travel . I had to attach the nut to the tangent arm carefully to keep it from binding as it moves along . A single screw attaches this nut to an aluminum bar that lets the nut swivel . Also , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the declination shaft because it is constrained between two similar aluminum bars on the slow-motion arm . All three bars are standard 3/4-by-1/8-inch aluminum stock from a hardware store , with a thin sheet of plexiglass covering them to keep the middle one in place . From start to finish this project cost only $200 , including oak for the tripod and a $60 motor . The result is a complete mount with a dual-axis drive  --  quite a suitable rig for deep-sky work . But I have encountered an interesting problem during polar alignment . If I align the mount on celestial north very carefully by star drift , then swing the telescope to a different part of the sky , the alignment is off again ! Apparently the threads at either end of the polar shaft are n't parallel . It is also possible that because pipe threads are tapered , the elevation of the polar axis changes as I swing across the sky . That is , the fittings unscrew toward east , and increased play allows the moving parts to sag . Even so the drive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on page 83 . Planning and building this mount have been pleasurable experiences for me - I now know the pride of manufacture . So if you have the time , and ca n't justify spending $1,000 or more for a commercial mount , just build one like mine ! THOMAS WRIGHT 233 S. Cuyler Ave . Oak Park , IL 60302 tuw@mcs.com Photograph The declination drive is a tangent-arm assembly made from pieces of a polyethylene kitchen cutting board . Even the nut was cut and tapped from this material . The nut is a tight fit on the 1/4-20 screw , so a tensioning spring was not needed . The ends of the screw ride in small bronze flange bearings , with doubled nuts serving as collars . // For anyone living near latitude 45deg , ordinary pipe fittings can make a serviceable equatorial mount . The author used what are called 2-inch fittings , so the polar and declination shafts actually have outside diameters of 2 3/8 inches .
