1 <p> We got up at dawn , ignored the yolky sun , loaded our navyblue Austin with suitcases , and then drove straight to the coast , stopping only on the verge of Sarajevo , so I could pee . I sang communist songs the entire journey : songs about mournful mothers looking through graves for their dead sons ; songs about the revolution , steaming and steely , like a locomotive ; songs about striking miners burying their dead comrades . By the time we got to the coast , I had almost lost my voice . <p> 2 <p> We waited for the ship on a long stone pier , which burnt the soles of my feet as soon as I took off my sandals . The air was sweltering , saturated with sea-ozone , exhaustion , and the smell of coconut sun-lotion , coming from the German tourists , already red and shellacked , lined up for a photo at the end of the pier . We saw the thin stocking of smoke on the horizon-thread , then the ship itself , getting bigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had a round straw hat with all the seven dwarfs painted on it . It threw a short , dappled shadow over my face . I had to raise my head to look at the grown-ups . Otherwise , I would look at their gnarled knees , the spreading sweat-stains on their shirts and sagging wrinkles of fat on their thighs . One of the Germans , an old , bony man , got down on his knees and then puked over the pier edge . The vomit hit the surface and then dispersed in different directions , like children running away to hide from the seeker . Under the wave-throbbing ochre and maroon island of vomit , a school of aluminum fish gathered and nibbled it peevishly . <p> 3 <p> The ship was decrepit , with peeling steel stairs and thin leaves of rust that could cut your fingers on the handrails . The staircase wound upwards like a twisted towel . " Welcome , " said an unshaven man , in a T-shirt picturing a boat with a smoke-snake wobbling on the waves and , above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of eyes . We sat on the upper board and the ship leapt over humble waves , panting and belching . We passed a line of little islands , akin to car wrecks by the road , and I would ask my parents , " Is this Mljet ? " and they would say , " No . " From behind one of the islands , shaven by a wild fire , a gust of waylaying wind attacked us , snatched the straw hat off my head and tossed it into the sea . I watched the hat teetering away , my hair pressed against my skull , like a helmet , and I understood that I would never , ever see it again . I wished to go back in time and hold on to my hat before the surreptitious whirlwind would hit me in the face again . The ship sped away from the hat , and the hat was transformed into a distant beige stain on the snot-green sea . I began crying and sobbed myself to sleep . When I woke up , the ship was docked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Julius impressed a stern , moist kiss on my cheek  --  the corner of his mouth touched the corner of my mouth , leaving a dot of spit above my lip . But his lips were soft , like slugs , as if there was nothing behind to support them . As we walked away from the pier , he told us that he forgot his teeth at home , and then , so as to prove that he was telling us the truth , he grinned at me , showing me his pink gums with cinnabar scars . He reeked of pine cologne , but a whiff redolent of rot and decay escaped his insides and penetrated the cologne cloud . I hid my face into my mother 's skirt . I heard his snorting chuckle . " Can we please go back home ! " I cried . <p> 5 <p> We walked up a sinuous road exuding heat . Uncle Julius 's sandais clattered in a tranquilizing rhythm and I felt sleepy . There was a dense , verdureless thicket alongside the road . Uncle Julius told us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mljet that people used to walk in tall rubber boots all the time , even at home , and snake bites were as common as mosquito bites . Everybody used to know how to slice off the bitten piece of flesh in a split second , before the venom could spread . Snakes killed chickens and dogs . Once , he said , a snake was attracted by the scent of milk , so it curled up on a sleeping baby . And then someone heard of the mongoose , how it kills snakes with joy , and they sent a man to Africa and he brought a brood of mongooses and they let them loose on the island . There were so many snakes that it was like a paradise for them . You could walk for miles and hear nothing but the hissing of snakes and the shrieks of mongooses and the bustle and rustle in the thicket . But then mongooses killed all the snakes and bred so much that the island became too small for them . Chickens started disappearing , cats also , there were rumors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that were the result of paradisiacal inbreeding . Now they were trying to figure out how to get rid of mongooses . " So that 's how it is , " he said , " it 's all one pest and then stopped and took a pebble out of his left sandal . He showed the puny , gray pebble to us , as if holding unquestionable evidence that he was right . <p> 6 <p> He opened the gate and we walked through a small , orderly garden with stout tomato stalks , like sentries , alongside the path . His wife stood in the courtyard , her face like a loaf of bread with a small tubby potato in the middle , arms akimbo , her calves full of bruises and blood vessels on the verge of bursting , ankles swollen . She was barefoot , her big toes were crooked , taking a sudden turn , as if backing away in disgust from each other . She enveloped my head with her palms , twisted my head upwards , and then put her mouth over my mouth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hastily wiped off with my shoulder . Aunt Lyudmila was her name . <p> 7 <p> I clambered , dragging a bag full of plastic beach toys , after my sprightly parents , up a concrete staircase on the side of the house , with sharp stair edges and pots of unconcerned flowers , like servants with candles , on the banister side . <p> 8 <p> The room was fragrant with lavender , mosquito-spray poison , and dean , freshly ironed bedsheets . There was an aerial picture of a winding island ( Mljet , it said in the lower right corner ) and a picture of Comrade Tito , smiling , black-and-white , on the opposite wall . Below the window , the floor was dotted with mosquitoes  --  with a large green-glittering fly or a bee here and there  --  still stricken by the surprise . When I moved towards them , the wisp caused by my motion made them ripple away from me , as if retreating , wary of another surprise . <p> 9 <p> I lay on the bed , listening to the billowing-curtain flaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two oblong lakes , touching each other , at the top end of the picture-island , and on one of those lakes there was an island . <p> 10 <p> I woke up and the night was rife with the cicada hum , perpetual , as if it were the hum of the island engine . They were all sitting outside , around the table underneath the shroud of vine twisting up the lattice . There was a long-necked carafe , full of black wine , in the center of the table , like an axis . Uncle Julius was talking and they all laughed . He would bulge his eyes , lean forward , he would thrust his fist forward , then open it , and the hand would have the index finger pointed at the space between my mother and his wife , and then the hand would retract back into the fist , but the finger would reappear , tapping its tip against the table , ' as if telegraphing a message . He would then stop talking and withdraw back into the starting position , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 <p> Uncle Julius spoke : " We brought beekeeping to Bosnia . Before the Ukrainians came , the natives kept their bees in mud-and-straw hives and when they wanted the honey they would just kill them all with sulfur . My grandfather had fifty beehives three years after coming to Bosnia . Before he died , he was sick for a long time . And the day he died , he asked to be taken to the bees and they took him there . He sat by the hives for hours , and wept and wept , and wept out a sea of tears , and then they put him back into his bed and an hour later he died . " " What did he die of ? " Aunt Lyudmila asked . <p> " Dysentery . People used to die of that all the time . They 'd just shit themselves to death . " <p> 12 <p> I went down the stairs and declared my thirst . Aunt Lyudmila walked over to the dark corner on my right-hand side , turned on the light ablaze , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lid . She took off the lid and grabbed a tin cup and shoved her arm into the square . I went to the water tank ( for that 's what it really was ) and peeked over . I saw a white slug , as big as my father 's thumb , on the opposite wall . I could not tell whether it was moving upwards or it was just frozen by our sudden presence . The dew on its back twinkled , it looked like a severed tongue . I glanced at Aunt Lyudmila , but she did n't seem to have noticed anything . She offered me the cup , but I shook my head and refused to drink the water , which , besides , appeared turbid . <p> So they brought me a slice of cold watermelon and I drowsily masticated it . " Look at yourself , " Uncle Julius said . " You do n't want to drink the water ! What would you do if you were so thirsty that you were nearly crazy and having one thought only-water , water !  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Nine , " my mother said . <p> 13 <p> Uncle Julius told us that when he was in the Arkhangelsk camp , Stalin and his parliament devised a law that said if you were repeatedly late for school or missed several days with no excuse , you would get six months to three years in a camp . So , suddenly , in 1943 , the camp was full of children , only a little bit older than me  --  twelve , fifteen years old . They did n't know what to do in the camp , so the criminals took the nicest looking to their quarters and fed them and , you know ( no , I did n't ) , abused them . So they were there . They died like flies , because it was cold , and they lost their warm clothing , they did n't know how to preserve or protect the scarce food and water they were allotted . Only the ones that had protectors were able to survive . And there was a boy named Vanyka : gaunt , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filching food from the weaker ones , by lending himself to different protectors and bribing guards . Once  --  I think he drank some vodka with the criminals  --  he started shouting : " Thank you , Vozhd , for my happy childhood ! " From the top of his lungs : " Thank you , Stalin , for my happy childhood ? And they beat him with gun butts and took him away . <p> 14 <p> " Do n't torture the boy with these stories . He wo n't be able to sleep ever again . " " No , let him hear , he should know . " <p> 15 <p> Then they sent Uncle Julius to a different camp , and then to another one , and he did n't even know how much time or how many camps he passed through , and he found himself in Siberia . One spring , his job was to dig big graves in the thawing ground , take the dead to the grave on a large cart , and then stuff them into the grave . Fifty per grave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the top of the graveload to get more space and meet the plan . He had big , big boots . One day they told him that there was a dead man in solitary confinement , so he pushed his cart there and put the corpse on the cart , and as he was pushing , the corpse moaned : " Let me die ! Let me die ! " I was so scared I almost died , I fell down , and he kept moaning : " Let me die ! I do n't want to live ! " So I pushed the cart behind the barrack and I leaned over him . He was emaciated and had no teeth and one of his ears was missing , but he had blue , blue eyes . It was Vanyka ! He looked much older , oh my God ! So I gave him a piece of bread that I had saved for the bad days and told him that I remembered him and this is what he told me . <p> 16 <p> They took him away and mauled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Then they moved him to another camp and he had problems there all the time , because he would speak out again , despite his better judgment . He knew how to steal from the weaker and there were still men who liked him . He won acclaim when he killed a marked person , some Jew , after losing a card game . He killed more . He did bad , bad things and learned how to survive , but he could never keep his snout shut . So they sent him to the island where they kept the worst of the worst . The nearest guard was on the shore fifty kilometers away . They let the inmates rob and kill each other like mad dogs . Once a month the guards would come in , leave the food , and count the corpses and graves and go back to their barracks by the sea . So one day Vanyka and two others killed some other inmates , took their food and clothes , and set out on foot towards the shore . It was a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every day  --  so they thought they could walk over the frozen strait , if they avoided the guards . But they got lost and ran out of food and Vanyka and one of the other two agreed by exchanging glances to kill the third one . And they did and they ate his flesh , and they walked and walked and walked . Then Vanyka killed the other one and ate him . But the guards with dogs tracked him down and caught him and he ended up in solitary confinement here and he did n't know how long he had been there . All he wanted was to die and he 'd smash his head against the walls and he 'd try to choke himself with his tongue . He refused to eat , but they 'd force him , if only to make him live longer and suffer more . " Let me die ? he cried and cried . <p> 17 <p> Uncle Julius was reticent and no one dared to say anything . But I asked : " So what happened to him ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a motion with his hand , as if thrusting me aside , out of his sight . <p> 18 <p> I woke up and did n't know where I was or who I was , but then I saw the photo of Mljet and I recognized it . I got up , out of my non-being , and stepped into the inchoate day . It was purblindingly bright , but I could hear the din of the distant beach : bashful whisper of waves , echoes of sourceless music , warbling of boat motors , shrieks of children , syncopated splashing of oars . Bees levitated over the staircase flowers and I passed them cautiously . There was breakfast on the table in the net-like shadow of the vines : a plate with smoldering , soggy eggs , a cup with a stream of steam rushing upwards , and seven slices of bread , on a mirroring steel tray , leaning on each other like fallen dominoes . There was no one around , apart from shadows stretching on the courtyard stone pavement . I sat down and stirred my white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it kept revolving on its back , slower and slower , until it came to a reluctant stop . <p> 19 <p> After breakfast , we would go down a dirt path resembling a long burrow in the shrub . I 'd carry my blue and white Nivea inflatable ball and sometimes I would inadvertently drop it and it would bounce , ahead of us , in slow motion . I 'd hear bustle in the thicket  --  a snake , perhaps . But then there would be more bustle and I 'd imagine a mongoose killing the snake , the whole bloody battle , the writhing snake entangled with the mongoose trying to bite off its head , just the way I saw on TV , on Survival . I 'd wait for ' my parents , for I did n't know what sort of feeling a fierce mongoose would have towards a curious boy  --  would it , perhaps , want to bite his head off ? . <p> 20 <p> We 'd get to the gravel beach , near the dam dividing the two lakes . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before I would be allowed to swim . On the left , there would usually be an old man , his skin puckered here and there , a spy novel over his face , white hair meekly bristling on his chest , his belly nearly imperceptibly ascending and descending , with a large metallic-green fly on the brim of his navel . On our right , two symmetrical old men , with straw hats , in baggy trunks , would play chess in serene silence , with their doughy breasts overlooking the board . There were three children a little farther away . They would sit on the towel , gathered around a woman , probably their mother , who would distribute tomatoes and slices of bread with a layer of sallow spread on them . The children would all simultaneously bite into their slices and their tomatoes , and then chew vigorously . The tomato slime would drip down their chins , they would be seemingly unperturbed , but when they were done eating , the mother would wipe their recalcitrant faces with a stained white rag . <p> 21 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swim and I 'd totter over the painful gravel and enter the shallows . I would see throbbing jellyfish floating by . The rocks at the bottom were covered with slimy , slippery lichen . I 'd hesitantly dive and the shock of coldness would make me feel present in my own body  --  I 'd be clearly aware of my ends , I 'd be aware that my skin was the border between the world and me . Then I 'd stand up , the quivering lake up to my nipples , and I 'd wave to my parents and they 'd shout : " Five more minutes ! " <p> 22 <p> Sometimes I 'd see fish in pellucid water , gliding along the bottom . Once I saw a school of fish that looked like miniature swordfish , with silver bellies and pointed needle noses . They were all moving as one and then they stopped before me , and hundreds of little wide-open eyes stared at me in dreadful surprise . Then I blinked and they flitted away . <p> 23 <p> We walked up the path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shade and , now and then , there would be a thin gilded beam , which managed to break through the shrub and olive trees , like a spear , sticking out of the ground . Cicadas were revving and the warmth of the ground enhanced the fragrance of dry pine needles on the path . I entered the stretch of the path that had been in the shadow of the tall pines for a while , and the sudden coolness made me conscious of how hot my shoulders felt . I pressed my thumb firmly against my shoulder and , when I lifted it , a pallid blot appeared , then it slowly shrunk , back into the ruddiness . <p> 24 <p> There was a man holding a German shepherd on a leash , much of which was coiled around his hand . The shepherd was attempting to jump at a mongoose backed against a short ruin of a stone wall . As the dog 's jaw snapped a breath away from the mongoose 's snout , the man would pull the dog back . The mongoose 's hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , appearing dangerous , but I knew it was just madly scared . The eyes had a red glow , akin to the glow that people who glanced at the flashlight have on bad color photos . The dog was growling and barking and I saw the pink and brown gums and the bloodthirst saliva running down the sides of the jaw . Then the man let the dog go and there was , for just a moment , hissing and wheezing , growling and shrieking . The man pulled the dog back and the mongoose lay on its back , showing its teeth in a useless scowl , the paws spread , as if showing it was harmless now , and the eyes were wide open , the irises stretched to the edge of the pupils , flabbergasted . There was a hole in its chest  --  the dog seemed to have bitten off a part of it-and I saw the heart , like a tiny tomato , pulsating , as if hiccuping , slower and slower , with slightly longer moments between the throbs , and it simply stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My sandals were full of pine needles and I would have to stop to take them out . Thousands of fireflies floated in the shrubs , lighting and vanishing , as if they were hidden fairy photographers with flashlights , taking our snapshots . " Are you hungry ? " my mother asked . <p> 26 <p> We would sit under the cloak of vines , with a rotund jar of limpid honey and a plate of pickles . Uncle Julius would dip a pickle into the honey and several bees would peel themselves off the jar and hover above the table . I would dip my finger and try to get it to my lips before the thinning thread of honey would drip on my naked thighs , but I would never make it . <p> Sometimes , around lunchtime , Uncle Julius would take me to his apiary . He would put on a white overall and a white hat with a veil falling down on his chest , so he looked like a bride . He would light a torn rag and order me to hold it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to be absolutely silent and not to move and not to blink . I 'd peek from behind his back , my hand with the smoldering rag protruded . He would take the lid off a beehive , carefully , as if he were afraid of awakening the island , and the buzz would rise like a cloud of dust and hover around us . He would scrape off the wax between the frames and then take them out , one by one , and show them to me . I 'd see the molasses of bees fidgeting . " They work all the time , " he 'd whisper . " They never stop . " I 'd be frightened by the possibility of being stung , even though he told me that the bees would not attack me if I pretended not to exist . <p> The fear would swell , and the more I 'd think about it , the more unbearable the unease would be . Eventually , I 'd break down and run back to the house , get on the stairs , from where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the slow , wise motions of his apt hands . I 'd watch him , as if he were projected on a screen of olive trees and isles of beehives , then he 'd turn to me and I could discern a peculiar , tranquil smile behind the veil . <p> 27 <p> Mother and Father were sitting at the stern , with their feet in tepid bilge water , Uncle Julius was rowing , and I was sitting at the prow , my feet dangling overboard . The surface of the lake would ascend with an inconspicuous wave and my feet would delve into the coolness of menthol-green water . With the adagio of oars , creaking and splashing , we glissaded towards the lake island . There was a dun-colored stone building , with small drawn-in windows , and an array of crooked olive trees in front of it . Uncle Julius steered the scow toward a puny desolate pier . I slipped stepping out , but Uncle Julius grabbed my hand and I hung for a moment over the throbbing lake with a sodden loaf of bread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the surface , like an ice floe . <p> 28 <p> " These lakes , " Uncle Julius said , " used to be a pirate haven in the sixteenth century . They 'd hoard the loot and bring hostages here and kill them and torture them  --  in this very building  --  if they did n't get the ransom . They say that this place is still haunted by the ghosts of three children they hung on meat hooks because their parents did n't pay the ransom . Then this was a nunnery and some people used to believe that even the nuns were not nuns but witches . Then it was a German prison . And now , mind you , it 's a hotel , but there are hardly any tourists ever . " <p> 29 <p> We walked into the sonorous chill of a large stone-walled hall . There was a reception desk , but nobody behind it , and a smiling Tito picture over the numbered cubbyhole shelf . Then we walked through a long tunnel and then through a low door , so everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in a cubicle-like windowless room ( " This used to be a nun cell , " Uncle Julius whispered ) , then we entered the eatery ( they had to bend their knees and bow their heads , as if genuflecting , again ) with long wooden tables and , on them , two parallel rows of plates and utensils . We sat there waiting for the waiter . There was a popsicle-yellow lizard , as big as a new pencil , on the stone wall behind Uncle Julius 's back . It looked at us with an unblinking marble ' eye , apparently perplexed , and then it scurried upwards , towards an obscure window . <p> 30 <p> This was what Uncle Julius told us : <p> " When I was a young student in Moscow , in the thirties , I saw the oldest man in the world . I was in a biology class , it was in a gigantic amphitheater , hundreds of rows , thousands of students . They brought in an old man who could n't walk , so two comrades carried him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet were dangling between them , but he was all curled up like a baby . They said he was a hundred and fifty-eight years old and somewhere from the Caucasus . They put him sideways on the desk and he started crying like a baby , so they gave him a stuffed toy  --  a cat , I think , but I ca n't be certain , because I was sitting all the way up in one of the last aisles . I was looking at him as if through the wrong side of a telescope . And the teacher told us that the old man cried all the time , ate only liquid foods , and could n't bear being separated from his favorite toy . The teacher said that he slept a lot , did n't know his name , and had no memories . He could say only a couple of words , like water , poo-poo , and such . I figured out then that life is a circle , you get back right where you started if you get to be a hundred and fifty-eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own tail , all is for naught . We live and live , and in the end we 're just like this boy "  --  he pointed at me  --  " knowing nothing , remembering nothing . You might as well stop living now , my son . You might just as well stop , for nothing will change . " <p> 31 <p> When I woke up , after a night of unsettling dreams , the suitcases were agape and my parents were packing them with wrinkled underwear and shirts . Uncle Julius came up with a jar of honey as big as my head and gave it to my father . He looked at the photo of Mljet and then put the tip of his finger at the point in the upper right corner , near the twin lakes , which looked like gazing eyes . " We are here , " he said . <p> 32 <p> The sun had not risen yet from behind the hill , so there were no shadows and everything looked muffled , as if under a sheet of fine gauze . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and moist . We passed a man carrying a cluster of dead fish , with the hooks in their carmine gills . He said " Good morning ! " and smiled . <p> We waited at the pier . A shabby boat , with paint falling off and Pirate written in pale letters on the bow , was heading , coughing , towards the open sea . A man with an anchor tattooed on his right arm was standing at the rudder . He had a torn red and black flannel shirt , black soccer shorts , and no shoes his feet bloated and filthy . He was looking straight ahead towards the ferry that was coming into the harbor . The ferry slowed down to the point of hesitant floating , and then it dropped down its entrance door , like a castle bridge , with a harsh peal . It was a different ship than the ship we had come on , but the same man with the hobbling-boat shirt said " Welcome ! " again , and smiled , as if recognizing us . <p> We passed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bread , dropped behind a gigantic ship . On one of the islands , and we passed it close-by , there was a herd of goats . They looked at us mildly confounded , and then , one by one , lost interest and returned to grazing . An man with a camera , probably a German tourist , took a picture of the goats , and then gave the camera to his speckle-faced , blue-eyed son . The boy pointed the camera towards the sun , but the man jokingly admonished him , turning him , and the camera , towards us , while we grinned at him , helpless . <p> 33 <p> It took us only four hours to get home from the coast and I slept all the time , oblivious to the heat , until we reached Sarajevo . When we got home , the shriveled plants and flowers were in the midst of the setting-sun orange spill . All the plants had withered , because the neighbor who was supposed to water them died of a sudden heart attack . The cat , having not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nearly mad with hunger .
