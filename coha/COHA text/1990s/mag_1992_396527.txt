As Wayne 's World continues to party on at the box office ( grossing more than $46 million in its first three weeks ) , the public-access TV shows so lovingly spoofed by spaced-out teen host Wayne Campbell and his nerdy sidekick Garth Algar ( Mike Myers and Dana Carvey , above ) are alive and , well , weirdly thriving on hundreds of local cable outlets around the country . Some of these programs are crude Wayne wannabes ; others look uncannily like clones  --  right down to the suburban plywood basements in which they are taped . Though nearly all operate on sub-basement budgets , they are sustained by the sheer manic enthusiasm of their hosts : UFO fanatics , country and western buffs , aspiring stand-up comics and down-and-dirty talk show hosts . " I do n't think these people are crazy . They just have a great desire to get in the public eye , " says Minneapolis producer Bo Kaprall . " Everyone wants to be a star . " In the past two years , Kaprall has screened 1,800 public-access shows  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which he excerpts on Access America , his weekly series ( Thursdays at 9:30 P.M. ET ) on cable 's Comedy Central network . " Public access , " insists Kaprall , " is totally a mirror image of America . " Actually it looks more like a funhouse mirror , judging by the no-waaaaay-out specimens collected here : CABLE CUISINE , ARLINGTON , MASS . Over a sizzling ( and none too sanitary ) pan of shrimp scampi , host David Sammarco , 30  --  better known as Chef Rambo  --  rates the babe-osity of Married ... with Children 's teenage metalhead Christina Applegate . Flexing his pecs and sharpening his cleaver , the stocky , long-haired Sammarco ( a caterer in his other , daytime , life ) says in a Rockyesque accent : " Thumbs up to the daughter . " Schwing ! Set in the Arlington High School home-economics kitchen , the show mixes macho cuisine ( big-time ground pepper ) with rambling asides on the battle of the sexes . " Yo , ladies , what 's the gig with these guys on 90210 ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chopping " scunions " ( scallions ) . " They have no bodies . A little mousse in their hair and you all go crazy . Please explain . " It 's not hard to explain Chef Rambo 's appeal . " He 's not hoity-toity , " says his producer , Rob Hawley . " People can identify with him . " Yo , like who does n't eat out of the frying pan ? Or stick their fingers in the tomato sauce ? Or chug water out of a gallon jug ? LARZ FROM MARS , FAIRFAX COUNTY , VA . Hosted by former cab driver Larry " Larz " LaComa , 30 , this talk-variety show features wacky regulars like Frosty the Snowman ( he 's plastic ) and Marge the mannequin ( a mere torso ) along with stream-of-consciousness banter , jangling acoustic guitar performances and segments such as Let 's Bitch About It and Success Through Procrastination . Clad in a ' ' 60s tie-dyed shirt ( as are Frosty and Marge ) , LaComa holds court , Carson-style , at a makeshift desk . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no matter how bad we are , we ca n't get canceled , " he crows . How bad can they get ? Well , how about Larz 's current contest for best videotape footage of a nose picker ? Party on . THE AUNT GAIL SHOW , NEW YORK CITY In this soap opera spoof , Barbie dolls , manipulated and voiced by two New York University film school graduates , half-brothers Paul Silverzweig , 21 ( left ) , and Jon Sapinosa , 20 , act out the roles of Aunt Gail , a wealthy urbanite , and her freeloading extended family . When the three-season-old serial ( actually a show within a show called Mrs. Mouth that 's taped , Wayne-style , in Paul 's parents ' Broomall , Pa. , basement ) recently asked if Aunt Gail should cut , perm or dye her hair , fans formed a Barbie queue on the call-in lines . Their verdict : Cut it and dye it a bright red . SISTER PAULA , PORTLAND , OREG . Those lips , those eyes , that bullfrog voice ! " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " booms Sister Paula , who , at 53 and 6 ' ' 1-1/2 " , is built like a linebacker . " It was in 1950 , as a 12-year-old innately effeminate boy ( named Larry Nielsen ) that I was born again . " But it was n't until four years ago , encouraged by a Pentecostal cable televangelist named Naomi Harvey , that Paula launched her own TV ministry . Some clergymen " have been appalled , " admits Harvey , " but after a few listened and talked to Paula , they have been open and accepting . " Sister Paula has been quite open with her viewers : " I have my mother 's features and my father 's fixtures , " she quips . Indeed , blessed with a sense of humor as well as a calling to the pulpit , Paula describes herself as " Tammy Faye with a 5 o'clock shadow . " SHIRLEY U.

I had always wanted to do a show about Shirley 's beauty tips , so I used that . " The tossed oatmeal covered her face and doubled as a beauty mask . She has also rollerbladed around in bathrobe and slippers with a baby doll strapped to her side , offering tips on how to look more attractive to your husband ( " Wrap a towel around your head and clip an earring it " ) . And when she wanted a free sushi meal , Shirley shrewdly got her favorite Japanese chef to go on the show , Shirley , you digest . MYSTERIES FROM BEYOND THE OTHER DOMINION , LOS ANGELES With his thick eyeglasses , scraggly beard and skinny frame , he looks like a perfect parody of the frog-dissecting high school science teacher .

DINO &; ROCCO 'S BACK ALLEY , LOS ANGELES Call them Wayne and Garth 's evil twins . With their brain-dead skits , Dino ( Dave DiNatale , 31 , right ) and Rocco ( Todd Colby Pliss , 26 ) have managed to offend nearly every minority . Sometimes they cross the line from tasteless to hateful . " If you did n't bash a gay guy today , do it tomorrow , " craked DiNatale on one episode , after which Century Cable threatened to drop the show ; it has n't , despite pressure from gay activists . DiNatale and Pliss also pretend to comb through celebrities ' garbage cans and make their guests sit on a toiler seat . " We 're the bad boys of puke access , " they boast .
