You have probably never heard of Robert A. Bonifas , but you may be seeing a lot of him in the next few months . Bonifas , the owner of an Aurora , Ill. , burglar-alarm company , is the star of a 30-sec. spot that the HMO industry is considering rolling out across the U.S. this summer to keep Congress from imposing new regulations on them in a burst of election-year populism . " We work hard to make people safer , and we work hard to offer our employees health insurance , " Bonifas says in rich Middle American earnestness . " Higher health-insurance costs may not be a big deal to some politicians , but to our employees and their families , it 's a very big deal . " The camera scans Bonifas and his office of contented , healthy workers , toiling away as a message on the screen warns that Washington could leave 2 million people like them without health insurance . " When politicians play doctor , " a voice concludes , " real people can get hurt . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens when government tries to do too much , and almost lost his presidency over it . When that disaster propelled the Republicans into control of Congress for the first time in 40 years , they tried to go too far in the other direction , with a proposal to cut Medicare-spending growth so they could raise money for tax cuts . That forced the 1995 government shutdown that put Clinton back on top of the game . Thus it would be understandable if neither party ever wanted to go near the issue again . <P> But in this season of contentment , the calculation in Washington is that managed care , and its shortcomings , may be the only issue compelling enough to get voters to look up from their barbecue grills . Just back from his trip to China , Clinton plans this week to step up his road campaign for the measure he calls a Patients ' Bill of Rights , which would offer a wide new array of protections to the more than 150 million Americans in managed care . House Republican leaders , though late to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's in many respects . What remains to be seen is whether politicians are serious about passing a law or would just as happily settle for a campaign slogan . <P> That there is a new opportunity for action is largely due to an irony that Hillary Clinton would surely appreciate : much of what people feared from her massive and intrusive health plan has actually come to pass without it . Americans gave the private sector a chance to come up with an answer , and it turned out to be not so different from the one government was accused of offering four years ago : a big , complicated bureaucracy . While most Americans with health insurance say they 're satisfied with their coverage , 35% of those surveyed in a TIME/CNN poll complained about the growing hassle involved with their coverage , and a wide majority expressed support for such reform proposals as the right to choose one 's own doctor ( 79% ) and the right to appeal HMO decisions to a neutral third party ( 70% ) .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
