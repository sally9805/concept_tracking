WELL , WHAT DID YOU EXPECT to find in the Abbey Road vaults  --  Al Capone ? The hype preceding last week 's debut of Free as a Bird , the Beatles ' first new single since The Long and Winding Road in 1970 , was so intense that anything short of the world premiere of Beethoven 's 10th would have been anticlimactic . The clock on the Sunday edition of abc 's Beatles Anthology did n't help : Two minutes to Free as a Bird ... one minute ... 15 seconds ... as if it were a countdown to a very special Dick Clark 's Rockin ' New Year 's Eve . Coming at the end of two hours of good music and great vibes , this souped-up , no-muffler megaproduction of John Lennon 's wispy little air made the surviving Beatles sound  --  and their longtime fans feel  --  very old indeed . <P> In the original 1977 demo tape , widely available on bootleg cassette , Lennon prefaces the tune by announcing , in the terse gutturals of a Brooklyn gangster , " Free . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absent in the new version , abounds on the two-CD album The Beatles Anthology ( Apple/Capitol )  --  60 tracks of the group 's compositions , cover recordings , outtakes , TV skits and reminiscences . <P> As the Sunday ABC show expertly evoked the Beatles ' burgeoning popularity from 1958 to 1964 , so this album produces all the evidence anyone will ever need of their growth during those years as musicians , singers and composers . Lennon , Paul McCartney and George Harrison began the way a million other children of early rock ' n ' roll did : by singing rough copies of their idols ' numbers into clumsy tape recorders in their parents ' rec rooms . Six years and two crucial recruits ( Ringo Starr and producer George Martin ) later , voila  --  meet the Beatles . <P> The big news on this album is the emergence of seven early , previously unreleased songs by Lennon , McCartney and Harrison in various collaborative permutations . But before anyone starts the countdown clock , be warned that there are no unpanned nuggets here . The five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vague signposts to the musical trails the lads would later blaze . The first , In Spite of All the Danger , is a Paul-and-George ballad with John singing lead , the others singing doo-wop with a perversely rockabilly twist , and an anonymous pal banging out triplets on a piano . They imitate the Everly Brothers ' tight harmonies on Hello Little Girl , Maurice Williams on Like Dreamers Do . <P> The most entertaining cuts show the Beatles ' early gift for parody . You 'll Be Mine , a Lennon-McCartney jape from 1960 , suggests a Five Satins love song as it might have been tortured by a fourth-rate crooner in a Blackpool pub . John offers a basso-preposteroso spoken verse : " My darlin ' ... I looked into your eyes , and I could see a National Health eyeball ... " The band brought the same proto-camp tone to covers of Three Cool Cats and Sheik of Araby , on a failed audition tape for Decca Records on New Year 's Day , 1962 . Raw and cheeky , the Beatles sound at best like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either .
