I took the subway downtown recently to the great lofts of New York City 's Silicon Alley to make a condolence call . The infant Stim , a Website that was born here in May amid a tide of ain't-the-Net-great hype , had just succumbed , carried off by a corrective wave of antihype . I figured I 'd pay my respects to the survivors . <P> I found Mikki Halpin , Stim 's erstwhile editor , sitting among a double row of mauve , mostly vacant cubicles . Stim ( named after William Gibson 's imaginary " digital drug " ) was typical of the flood of ' zines that launched last year . It was silly and fun and new , and it took the kinds of risks you do n't take if you 've already found a market . In the weeks preceding the Democratic National Convention , for instance , Stim 's political commentator was forbidden to read or listen to press accounts of the presidential race ; he had to write his stuff cold . Then when the Dick Morris scandal broke , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prostitute . " We wondered if maybe hookers were untapped sources of political gossip , " says Halpin . For the " security issue , " one of Stim 's contributors wanted to put on a bulletproof Kevlar vest and let a friend shoot him in the chest . ( The experiment was scotched when the shooter chickened out . ) <P> Stim was a bold bid by Prodigy , the dowdy online service started by IBM and Sears , to break into the hot , youth-oriented Web-content business . Some $2 million was budgeted for the first year , paying the salaries of a dozen staff members . But when the first million was gone , with readership scant and no real revenue in sight , Prodigy decided to cut its losses . The company has given Halpin Stim 's name and the computer that housed it . A neighboring firm has donated some office space . But with nothing to pay its contributors , Halpin &; Co. must resurrect the ' zine on little more than good wishes . As she says , " Operations such as processing invoices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no money . " <P> Stim 's tale is typical , if you 're to believe the Wall Street Journal , which , coincidentally , ran a front-page story the day Stim hit the skids pointing out that too many Web publishers were competing for too few ad dollars . Consequently , lots of them began quitting . The cowards . <P> Here 's my prediction : no Web publisher will make money this year or even , maybe , the next few . This is an infant medium ; it needs time to find its way . A print magazine can take five years and many millions of dollars before turning a profit , and that 's in a proven market where people actually pay for content . We need courage if we 're going to create something wonderful . The New Yorker nearly died in 1925 , the year it was born . Indeed , it did die for one day , before its patron reconsidered . The magazine at the time had a paltry circulation of 2,700  --  perhaps , as James Thurber once pointed out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not saying Stim could ever have grown into the New Yorker . Or maybe I am . The point is , we will probably never know . <P> You can read the Netly News daily on the World Wide Web at
