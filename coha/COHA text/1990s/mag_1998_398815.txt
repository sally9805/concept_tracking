Why bonds and income stocks may beat the blue chips // IN 1998 , YOU CAN RELY ON BONDS TO PERFORM THEIR TRADItional role as your portfolio 's calming influence . Consider the evidence : During Halloween week in October , when stock prices were zigzagging like a bunch of panicky teens fleeing a monster on Elm Street , the price of the benchmark 30-year U.S. Treasury bond moved little and finished the week about where it started . In contrast , stocks tanked more than 7% on their worst trading day of the week . Better yet , any swing that bond investors feel in 1998 is likely to be in their favor . Reason : With inflation subdued , the Federal Reserve is expected to leave interest rates alone or even to lower them . Thus 30-year Treasury yields could fall about a quarter of a percentage point to 5.75% , according to Michael Sivy , MONEY 's chief investment strategist . Some forecasters see an even bigger drop , to around 5.5% . Such a decline could produce total returns-interest or dividends plus price appreciation-on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are likely to earn on the average blue-chip stock . Furthermore , top safe yields run as high as 8.3% . Such a steady-and potentially profitable-outlook for bonds makes them an ideal investment to help you achieve your financial goals . Take for example Michael Kleeman , 48 , and his wife Veronica Napoles , 46 , of Larkspur , Calif. , shown opposite . The couple keep 44% of their $150,000 bond portfolio in a high-quality intermediate-term corporate bond fund , 20% in a convertible fund , 13% apiece in municipal and global bond funds and 10% in a high-yield bond fund . The portfolio returned an average of 11% over the 12 months through Nov. 1 , vs. about 9% for the Lehman Bros. bond index . Result : The couple are on target for paying their 10-year-old son 's college bills starting in 2006 . " Our bondholdings provide lower risk and predictable income , " says Kleeman . Whether you 're adding to a well-established portfolio or just beginning to invest , the 10-year Treasury is next year 's best bond to own . It recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9.6% total return for the year , assuming rates drop by half a point . In comparison , bonds with longer maturities pay higher yields-but not enough to justify the additional risk of losing principal if rates rise . Photograph Michael Kleeman and Veronica Napoles ' $150,000 bond portfolio keeps their investment risk low and provides steady income . // Your worst bond buy in ' 98 is a high-yield issue , better known as a junk bond . Junk recently yielded an average of 8.5%-just 2.5 percentage points more than Treasuries . " With this spread , you are not being paid enough for the extra default risk , " says analyst James Floyd of Leuthold Weeden Research in Minneapolis . If you are n't satisfied with the returns on bonds , without undue risk you can reach for yields of 7.8% to 8.3%-and , in some cases , total returns of 15% or more-by investing in preferred stocks , electric utilities and real estate investment trusts . The pros we consulted recommend eight such investments below . Preferred stocks So named because they have preference over common stock in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . First and most important , preferreds offer specified , bondlike yields . Next , the issuers are graded for financial security by such well-known judges as Moody 's and Standard &; Poor 's ; in general , a BBB- rating or higher is an acceptable risk . Finally , the issues are callable , which means that the company can redeem them at a predetermined date . Thus you 're assured of collecting the dividend only until the call date ; after that , if rates drop , the issue is likely to be redeemed and you will have to reinvest your proceeds at the prevailing lower rate . Three top preferreds are described below . ( Note : The percentage that follows the name of the stock is its stated yield ; the second percentage is the yield at the current price . ) Amerco 8.5% ( ticker symbol : AO A ; recently traded on the New York Stock Exchange at $25.50 ; 8.3% yield ; grade : BBB- ; earliest call : December 2000 ) . A favorite of Richard Lehmann , publisher of Income Securities Advisor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was issued by $1.7 billion Amerco , best known as U-Haul 's parent . But the company also owns real estate and insurance companies . Analysts believe that Amerco 's financial strength-reflected in its projected 17% annual earnings growth over the next five yearsmeans the company will have no problem paying its preferred dividends . Lehman Bros. 8.3% ( LEQ ; NYSE , $25.50 ; 8.1% ; BBB+ ; February 2001 ) . Richard Young , editor of Richard C. Young 's Intelligence Report ( $199 a year ; 800-777-5005 ) , likes this $15.4 billion securities underwriter , and no wonder : As of November 1997 , its annual earnings were running an estimated 35% ahead of last year 's . Moreover , Lehman 's BBB+ rating assures analysts that the company can continue to pay its preferred dividends even if hard times hit Wall Street . Cadbury Schweppes 8.625% ( CSD A ; NYSE , $26.75 ; 8.1% ; A- ; April 2002 ) . With $7 billion in annual revenues and a balance sheet recently strengthened by the $1 billion sale of some of its bottling plants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is another Richard Young pick . Even with an 8.1% yield , you get a relatively high rating of A- . Electric utilities // The yields on the following eight stocks will top the interest you can earn on most bonds in ' 98 , without exposing you to unnecessary risk . // For three years , most utility stocks have been depressed because of uncertainty over whether state regulators would approve key mergers and rate hikes . Recently , however , regulators have begun to rule in utilities ' favor , thus unleashing the potential for gratifying doubledigit returns . Unlike a decade ago , though , when you could differentiate between utilities based mainly on financial strength , you now have to select financially strong companies that also have solid growth prospects in a deregulated environment-and avoid those with high production costs or territories with tough competition . Here are three top selections : Atlantic Energy ( ATE ; NYSE , $19.25 ; 8% ) . The long-awaited merger of Atlantic City 's $1 billion utility with $1 billion Delmarva Power in Wilmington , Del. is virtually certain in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Connectiv , will supply power to a highgrowth area that includes southern New Jersey and parts of Delaware , as well as Atlantic City The impending merger has soothed analysts ' worries that Atlantic might be compelled to cut its dividend to boost its retained earnings and , hence , its stock price . Instead , analysts like David Schanzer of brokerage Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia expect the merger to protect the payout by strengthening the utility 's finances . Editor Gregory Weiss of the newsletter Investment Quality Trends ( $275 for one year ; 619-459-3818 ) , predicts the stock will rise to $23 in 1998 for a 28% total return . Central &; South West ( CSR ; NYSE , $21.25 ; 8.1% ) . For the past three years , the stock of this $51 billion provider of electricity and natural gas in Arkansas , Louisiana , Oklahoma and Texas languished as the company tried to squeeze a rate increase out of Texas regulators . C &SW; lost the battle recently-but analysts were pleased nonetheless because the state commission did not reduce rates as much as Wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it an excellent pick for income investors , says editor Michael Burke of the newsletter Investors Intelligence ( $184 a year ; 914632-0422 ) . CIBC Oppenheimer analyst Jonathan Raleigh sees C &SW's; stock climbing to $24 next year for a 21% total return . Peco Energy ( PE ; NYSE , $22.75 ; 7.9% ) . Regulators are expected to approve a settlement between consumer groups and $4.5 billion Peco , formerly Philadelphia Electric , which will let the utility boost rates to recover $4 billion of its investment in nuclear power plants . Mark Luftig , co-manager of the $140 million Strong American Utilities Fund , believes the stock could reach $27 over the next 12 months for a 27% total return . Real estate investment trusts The stocks of these companies , which invest in apartment complexes , office buildings and other properties , have boomed for two years as bargain hunters bid up the prices . But REITs have begun to cool as their shares have become more expensive . Thus in ' 98 , the average REIT will likely track the Dow 's estimated 9% return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the industry 's 5.8 % average and also offer potential capital gains . Analysts recommend these two first-rate trusts : Associated Estates Realty ( AEC ; NYSE , $22.25 ; 8.3% ) . Because its properties are in relatively slow-growth areas , cash-flow gains will slacken at this $94.4 million Cleveland REIT , which owns apartment buildings in Indiana , Kentucky , Michigan , Ohio and Pennsylvania . But Baltimore analysts Catherine Creswell of brokerage BT Alex . Brown and Rod Petrick of Legg Mason still favor the REIT . Reason : Lack of competition will allow it to hold rents steady . In the meantime , as interest rates fall , Petrick sees Associated 's stock rising to $25 over the next 12 months for a 21% total return . Health &; Retirement Properties ( HRP ; NYSE , $19 ; 7.8% ) . This $208 million REIT is the owner of 110 nursing homes and 26 assisted-living facilities , which serve elderly clients who can mostly take care of themselves but need help with some activities , such as housework . The REIT recently bought 29 office buildings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agencies . Analysts Robert Thornburg of brokerage D.A . Davidson in Great Falls , Mont . and Helen O'Donnell of PaineWebber in New York City have confidence in the staying power of the REIT 's yield . In addition , O'Donnell believes falling interest rates could help the stock reach $20 in 1998 for a 15% total return . In short , whether you choose a REIT or one of the other dividend-buoyed investments we 've described , they clearly are your best bet to beat the market in the bumpy year ahead . <p>
