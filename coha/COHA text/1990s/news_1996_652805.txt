<p> SOMETIME LAST WINTER THE drumbeat began sounding in Hollywood for an unknown actor named Matthew McConaughey . The 5 foot 11 inch , curly-haired , unfailingly polite Texan had just completed filming " A Time to Kill , " an adaptation of the John Grisham novel . Suddenly the word was out all over town : the fellow who had been discovered in a hotel bar in Austin , Tex. , was going to be a star . A big star . By the time he returned to Los Angeles after shooting was completed in Mississippi , Mr. McConaughey was overwhelmed with calls from agents , directors , writers and studio executives who had seen the movie trailer . He fled . <p> " I went off to Peru for 16 days , hiked through the jungle , " he said , seated barefoot on a narrow deck overlooking the Pacific Ocean in his ramshackle beach rental in Malibu . " The best decision in the world . After a while I started to respect and appreciate what I had just done . So when I came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predict with certainty whether Matthew McConaughey ( pronounced ma-CON-a-hey ) , 26 , will turn into Tom Cruise or just one more talented actor like David Caruso who tried  --  and failed  --  to become a movie star . Only last year Julia Ormond was hyped on magazine covers as an emerging movie star , but her role in " Sabrina " disappointed critics and audiences alike . <p> Yet based on his appearance as a good natured Tucson , Ariz. , policeman in the small comedy " Boys on the Side , " a role he got in his first Hollywood audition , and his nabbing of the plum part of Jake Brigance , a white lawyer defending a black man in the big-budget " Time to Kill , " Mr. McConaughey has convinced Hollywood executives that he is not only attractive and talented but also has that extra dimension  --  charisma , mystery and sex appeal  --  that makes for movie stars . <p> For the film , which opens on Wednesday , Mr. McConaughey was selected after Kevin Costner , Brad Pitt , Ralph Fiennes , Bill Paxton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered . Brigance , an upper-class Southerner , is called upon to defend a Mississippi factory worker ( Samuel L. Jackson ) , who killed two racist thugs in a rage after they had raped his 10-year-old daughter . The novel , which was adapted by Akiva Goldsman , was inspired by a case that Mr. Grisham , who lives in Mississippi , witnessed as a young lawyer . <p> Actually , so fast has Mr. McConaughey 's star risen that he was not even given top billing in " A Time to Kill . " That honor went to Sandra Bullock , who plays Brigance 's potential love interest , an ambitious Boston-born law student at the University of Mississippi . <p> Also making appearances are Donald Sutherland , as a grizzled veteran lawyer and mentor to Brigance , Ashley Judd as Brigance 's wife and Kevin Spacey as a smug prosecutor . Although Mr. Jackson , who got second billing , is at the center of the film , Mr. McConaughey clearly dominates ; for a young actor , it 's pretty heady . <p> Mr. McConaughey 's price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Time to Kill , " to at least $2 million . He has already rejected several action films and romantic comedies and is set to star with Jodie Foster in " Contact , " a thriller based on Carl Sagan 's book about an astronomer who comes in contact with extraterrestrials . Robert Zemeckis , who directed " Forrest Gump , " is making the film . <p> The actor has jumped from being one of a handful of young male stars on the April cover of Vanity Fair ( along with Leonardo DiCaprio , Benicio Del Toro ) to being the sole person pictured on the magazine 's current issue . He is also the subject of articles in Premiere , Entertainment Weekly , Harper 's Bazaar and Interview . It 's a publicity overkill that just may turn readers off as the actor inevitably repeats the same anecdotes about the making of his still unformed career . <p> Joel Schumacher , the director of " A Time to Kill , " first noticed Mr. McConaughey three years ago in " Dazed and Confused , " an offbeat 1993 comedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teen-agers . Mr. Schumacher invited the actor into the editing room of " Batman Forever , " which he also directed , with the purpose of casting him in a small role in " A Time to Kill . " But the more they talked , the more Mr. Schumacher became convinced that Mr. McConaughey could play Brigance . <p> Mr. Schumacher later called Lorenzo Di Bonaventura , president of worldwide theatrical production for Warner Brothers , who had worked on " Boys on the Side . " The two agreed on a screen test for the actor , who flew in from Texas where filming was taking place for John Sayles 's " Lone Star , " in which he appears as a town sheriff . Mr. McConaughey did two scenes , and the next day the results were shown to Mr. Grisham , who had casting approval , and to Warner Brothers executives , who were plainly reluctant about offering an unknown a top role in an almost $50 million film . <p> Mr. Schumacher was dazzled . <p> " He jumped off the screen , " the director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-confidence and sense of humor . He 's fresh but certainly not the boy next door because there 's a dangerousness to that good-old-boy quality . I do n't think you 'd let your daughter go out with Matthew . " <p> The actor 's on-screen presence is as striking as his looks . <p> " He 's a true leading man , " said Mr. Schumacher . " He has incredible features . His nose , his eyes , his lips , his body , his body language . " <p> Mr. Grisham was equally enthusiastic . " I watched the tape several times with my wife , Renee , " he said , " and I called Joel up and said , ' I love this guy . ' " <p> A bit nervously , Warner Brothers executives agreed to cast the actor , convinced that the Grisham name coupled with the weight of the rest of the cast , would lure audiences . " The camera loves him , " said Mr. Di Bonaventura . Test screenings of the movie have shown that women over 30 are especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Mr. Schumacher accorded Mr. McConaughey star treatment in the film , shooting the young actor in a way that underlined his best features , and offering plenty of close-ups . <p> " The one actor that keeps coming to mind is Paul Newman , " said Mr. Di Bonaventura . <p> The comparison pleases Mr. McConaughey , who idolizes Mr. Newman . In his home the other day , a prowling black Labrador retriever named Miss Hud , after the Newman film , nestled at the actor 's bare foot . The actor was wearing cut-off jeans and an open shirt , he had n't shaved in a few days , and his manner was engaging and confident . On the deck , an American flag fluttered beside the flags of Texas and California . The two-bedroom house is sparsely furnished , a bachelor 's pad , with dozens of scripts lined up neatly on the staircase . He shares the house with his business partner , Todd ( Gus ) Gustawes , a buddy from the University of Texas . <p> HE CONFERS frequently about his business affairs with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He often talks on the phone to Ms. Bullock , who has become a friend and adviser . Mr. McConaughey also keeps a journal of private thoughts . And every morning and evening he reads from Og Mandino 's " Greatest Salesman in the World , " a set of inspirational contemplations . <p> The book was voted the " most popular inspirational paperback " at Easter , 1983 , in a poll by the American Booksellers Association . In this month 's Vanity Fair , Sandra Bullock says she 's reading the book , too , and reveals that Mr. McConaughey gave her a copy on the set . <p> " God has helped a lot , honestly , " he said . " My relationship with Him is up at the top right now . We were raised to believe in God , always have . And there have been so many coincidences , so many great things happening to me in the last three years , I 'm not arguing at all , you know . " <p> " For the last three years I could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have not had to deal with the liars , the cheaters , the heathens . No one has tried to mess me up . I 've met some wonderful people . Now I notice everyone I talk to has an agenda . There 's nothing wrong with an agenda , but maybe I 'm getting a little more careful . " <p> Born in the city of Uvalde , Tex. , Mr. McConaughey grew up in Longview , near Dallas , in a middle-class family . His mother , Kay , does volunteer work with abused women ; his father , Jim , sold oil pipes and oil couplings , the same business that the actor 's two older brothers , Pat and Michael ( whom everyone calls Rooster ) , are engaged in . His father died of heart problems several years ago at the age of 63 , an event the actor discusses with sorrow and humor . <p> " He woke up one Monday morning , made love to my mother and as soon as he finished he died , " said Mr. McConaughey , chuckling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's how I 'm going to go , and he did . " Mr. McConaughey grinned . " It 's true . I love that story . " <p> After high school , Mr. McConaughey spent a year in Australia as an exchange student , then enrolled at the University of Texas , in Austin , where he toyed with the idea of becoming a lawyer but started taking film courses . Shortly before his senior year , in 1991 , Mr. McConaughey and a girlfriend went to the bar at the Hyatt Regency in Austin , where the bartender , told him that a casting director at the end of the bar was working on a film . <p> Mr. McConaughey introduced himself to Don Phillips , the producer and casting director , . ( The answer was no . ) <p> Mr. Phillips asked him to read for Mr. Linklater , who is now a close friend . " I wanted Matthew to read for this one part , a kind of sleazy character , an older guy who sticks around high school and picks up girls , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of transformed into that guy . He went from being this good-looking guy to this kind of stoned , swaggering dude . I said , ' You 're it ! ' He looked too good , of course , so we had to add a mustache and a tattoo . " <p> Mr. Linklater said the actor was so ideal for the role that scenes were added specifically for him . " He has this great chameleon quality , " said the director . " Even then you knew he was a leading man . He walked into a room , he controlled it . He had that air about him . " <p> After the film was completed , Mr. McConaughey completed his senior year at school and made a short film about the world of low riders called " Chicano Chariots . " Another chance audition led to the lead in " The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre . " After that he packed up and drove his U-Haul to Los Angeles in August 1993 . On his fifth day in Los Angeles , he was signed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Creative Artists Agency ) . He landed the male lead in Herbert Ross 's " Boys on the Side , " playing Drew Barrymore 's sweet-natured policeman lover . He also appears in a Bill Murray comedy , " Larger Than Life , " due in October . <p> What alarms him now , Mr. McConaughey said , is the inevitable lack of privacy . He is looking for guidance from the actors like Mr. Newman who seem to be able to handle fame . <p> " Everyone loves a bit of mystery , " he said . " It 's like going after a woman . There 's got to be a bit of a chase , there 's got to be some mystery . That makes it special , does n't it ? "
