<p> CHICAGO  --  At the start of the season , no one saw it coming . <p> Sure , the San Francisco Giants had added Barry Bonds to Will Clark and Matt Williams and they had a pitching staff that figured to get better . <p> But could anyone see the Giants running away with the NL West the way they are ? <p> " " We 're all looking rather sad when you compare us to the Giants , " Astros general manager Bill Wood said . " " If they put halves together , and the rest of us put halves together , it 's going to be one of the biggest runaways in history . " <p> The fact that the Atlanta Braves have stumbled makes the Giants ' relentless march even harder to take . <p> " " It 's just our misfortune that somebody in the division has put it together while we 're struggling , " Wood said . " " Atlanta has struggled this year , too . If this had been either one of the last two seasons , people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity to be right there with them . Instead , everybody 's looking up at the front-runner . " <p> Wood believes it is important that the Astros look inward to their own play and not at the Giants . <p> " " We have to be careful to not get dragged into a comparison of our club solely against what the Giants have done , " Wood said . <p> " " I 'm concerned about how we were compared to last year , what we can do to get better . Improvement in the second half is important . <p> We all believe that if we had a good second half , 48 or 50 wins , that something positive might happen . <p> " " Who knows , if we have the dynamite second half , say 52 wins , you never know what might happen . But I ca n't base everything that I do in the second half on the Giants . We 're worried really about the Houston ballclub . The players have to worry about the game they 're playing . <p> " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose . We 've had six opportunities head to head and we have n't done anything about it . We have to face facts . " The simple fact is this : Unless the Giants go into a terrible losing streak  --  like 10 or 12 in a row  --  between now and Aug. 1 , the race in the NL West is over . <p> One year after the Milwaukee Brewers finished second in the AL East in Phil Garner 's first season as manager , they have the worst record in the American League . The loss of Paul Molitor and Chris Bosio as free agents , a disappointing season from Bill Wegman and an injury to Pat Listach have the Brewers in the AL East basement . <p> How much of the blame goes to Garner ? " " Zero , " Brewers owner Bud Selig said . Garner 's contract runs through the 1994 season and the ex-Astro says he has no worries about job security . <p> " " It 's not a factor to me , and it never will be , " Garner said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would never be a concern of mine . If my firing were imminent , it would not affect the way I run the team . " <p> From Ray Ratto of the San Francisco Examiner : " " Separated at birth : A dead flounder left in a heater vent for a month and Jose Canseco 's karma . " <p> When Joe McIlvaine took over control of the New York Mets last week , he took a shot at the San Diego ownership . McIlvaine quit as Padres general manager last month when he tired of ownership 's desire to cut costs . <p> " " ( Mets owners ) Fred ( Wilpon ) and Nelson ( Doubleday ) talk about winning all the time , " McIlvaine said . " " In San Diego , that was n't always the first thing ownership talked about . " <p> McIlvaine was part of the Mets ' front-office staff that was intact when Lenny Dykstra was traded to Philadelphia . Dykstra sounded as if he had not forgotten . <p> " " He ( McIlvaine ) was part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole thing over there is a disgrace now . " <p> Could someone explain how Atlanta 's John Smoltz made the All-Star team with an 8-7 record and 3.21 earned run average ? <p> Braves manager Bobby Cox selected the pitchers for the team , but at some point , the National League should have stepped in and overridden Cox . <p> Worse , Cox said Greg Maddux , who is 7-8 , deserved to be an All-Star . <p> " " He has eight losses , but we 've scored nine runs in those eight losses , " Cox said . " " He pitches Sunday ( today ) . That 's the reason we did n't take him . " <p> Left off the All-Star staff was Cubs reliever Randy Myers , who has 27 saves in 29 chances when the team was selected . Fellow reliever Paul Assenmacher , who once played for the Braves , said : " " He ( Cox ) might have been a little biased in some aspects . You 're talking about someone ( Myers ) with two blown saves . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too ? " <p> Of the 57 players chosen for the All-Star team , 37 of them had bonuses . Minnesota 's Kirby Puckett received $ 100,000 , the largest bonus . Probably because his contract already is about the size of some countries ' budgets , San Francisco 's Barry Bonds did not have an All-Star bonus . <p> Neither did Darryl Kile of the Astros , who could not have envisioned a trip to the All-Star Game when he was negotiating his contract last winter . <p> Cincinnati 's Tom Browning still ca n't see anything wrong with his little side trip to a rooftop overlooking Wrigley Field last week during a Reds-Cubs game to a rooftop overlooking Wrigley Field . <p> " " I did n't do anything but give people a moment in the baseball season that they can remember and laugh at , " said Browning . <p> Reds manager Davey Johnson is not laughing . <p> " " That was an embarrassment to me , " Johnson said . " " It looks like I do n't have control . " <p> There was speculation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance , for just that reason  --  that he was trying to show up Johnson and gain some sort of upper hand on the manager . <p> Browning brushed off that suggestion . <p> " " The reason I did it was for the guys on the bench only , " Browning said . " " I was certainly not trying to show up anybody . <p> Believe me , there have been other opportunities when I could have . " <p> Browning was fined $ 500 , with the money going to a childrens hospital in Cincinnati . He is lucky he did n't pull this stunt on a manager like Lou Piniella , who ran the Reds last season . Browning and his upper-stratosphere ERA would have been released before he got off the rooftop . <p> Chris Jones , who was with the Astros briefly and unproductively last season , has become one of the bright spots for the Colorado Rockies . Cubs hitting coach Billy Williams believes Jones could blossom into a top-notch player . <p> " " He 's going to be a good one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He runs good . It 's up to him . He has the ability , certainly . " <p> Jones ' gung-ho style of play endears him to coaches . He runs hard , dives for balls and never gives up . <p> " " He 's a breath of fresh air in the ' 90s , " Colorado first-base coach Jerry Royster said . " " You do n't see many guys approaching the game like he does . " <p> The Philadelphia Phillies , to a man , ca n't wait for the All-Star break . They played that ridiculous doubleheader on July 2 that did n't end until nearly 5 a.m.because of numerous rain delays , then played a 20-inning game against Los Angeles last Wednesday that ended at 1:45 a.m <p> " " Somebody must think we make too much money , and they 're trying to make us earn it , " said Phillies first baseman John Kruk . <p> The day after the 20-inning game against the Dodgers , the Phillies ' bullpen was in a shambles . Starter Danny Jackson was told he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what kind of stuff he had that night . Jackson had nothing . He gave up 15 hits and 11 runs to San Francisco in 4 2/3 innings . After the game , he stood in the middle of the clubhouse , looked a group of reporters straight in the eye and said : " " That was pretty damn ugly , was n't it ?
