Section : Cover Story The awful acts of the past 100 years forced America to look at itself in the mirror <p> We are at once disgusted and fascinated by crime . First , we avert our eyes . Then we reach for the newspapers with their grisly headlines and stare for hours at our televisions as the accused villains go on trial . Every decade , it seems , produces a " crime of the century . " As E. L. Doctorow noted in Ragtime , headline writers way back in 1906 had already anointed the murder of renowned architect Stanford White the " Crime of the Century , " even though there were still 94 more years to go . <p> We cling to each detail of these dramas . The tantalizing tidbits  --  the color of the sultry murder victim 's nightgown , whether it was a foggy night or cruelly hot  --  make the unimaginable imaginable . " We want anything that would take us out of the boredom of everyday life , " says Colin Wilson , a bestselling British crime writer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unspeakable acts were committed , to convince ourselves that we 're immune from the same wretched fate  --  or perhaps to reassure ourselves that we 're incapable of such heinous behavior . Ann Rule is a popular true-crime writer who worked alongside Ted Bundy at Seattle 's Crisis Clinic before he went on his infamous killing spree . " Some people will put their heads in the sand , " Rule says , " while others want to look evil right in the eye , as if the more they know , the safer they will be . " <p> It is the unknowable face of evil , perhaps , that so compels . A deranged stalker  --  charismatic , deceptively attractive  --  kills a string of young women , all with long , dark hair . A workaday laborer targets young boys , burying their bodies one next to the other under his house . Why ? <p> As time goes by . Criminal acts tell us much about the times in which they were committed , the mores of the day illuminated by their violation . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says historian Roger Lane , author of Murder in America , " all of them are telling us something specifically about our society at that point in time . " Gary LaFree , a University of New Mexico criminology professor , attributes a crime surge in the first three decades of the 20th century to unemployment and labor unrest , Prohibition , and a questioning of middle-class values during the 1920s . But after World War II , crime dropped . The family structure was stable  --  TV 's Ozzie and Harriet were the model in the 1950s . The U.S. economy was strong . So was respect for the law . " We had just won a war with important ethical and moral overtones , " says LaFree . " There was trust in the government and political system . " <p> For a time , the violation of that trust captured the criminal imagination . Then society 's pillars began to crumble . Divorces increased ; families unraveled . Race riots and protests against the war in Vietnam broke out across the nation . Crime stayed high during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosperity reduced crime in the 1990s to the lowest level since World War II . <p> And in the new millennium ? " Oklahoma City , I 'm afraid , is the future , " says Lane . " At the end of this American century and the beginning of the next , all the world 's grievances center on Uncle Sam . " Sadly , there will be many more " crimes of the century . " THE 1900S When Harry shot Stanford <p> By 1906 , the Victorian era was over , but it was still a strait-laced time . Even so , people could n't get enough of a juicy sex story , especially one about the rich and famous . Stanford White was the country 's leading architect , a celebrated visionary and man about town . White designed splendid homes and grand buildings . But he was also a cad who had affairs with young showgirls and threw wild bashes with women popping out of huge pies . <p> On June 25 , White was shot three times by Pittsburgh railroad scion Harry Thaw in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roof of Madison Square Garden , which White had designed . " You deserve this , " Thaw cried angrily , after pulling the trigger . " You have ruined my wife . " Some 20 years younger than White , Thaw was insanely jealous of the 54-year-old architect . Five years earlier , White had seduced Evelyn Nesbit , the comely chorus girl Thaw eventually wed . In seducing the fetching 16-year-old , White had her pose half-naked in a kimono and slipped her a glass of spiked champagne in a mirrored room in his apartment . <p> Thaw 's revenge , then , was justified , at least in his mind . But he was no Prince Charming . A notorious playboy , he was known for whipping girls in a room he rented in a brothel . He whipped Nesbit , too , before they were married . The details tumbled out at the trial , the public 's thirst unslaked by the endless stream of tawdriness . Thaw , meanwhile , seemed unconcerned , passing the days in his Tombs prison cell munching squab and sipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a field day . At the trial , Thaw 's lawyer , Delphin Delmas , told the jury his client suffered from " dementia Americana , " a form of insanity " that persuades an American that whoever violates the sanctity of his home or the purity of his wife or daughter has forfeited the protection of the laws of this state . " The trial ended with a hung jury . A year later , Delmas tried another tack , saying Thaw was just plain crazy . The second jury bought it , finding Thaw not guilty by reason of insanity . The onetime playboy was shipped off to an asylum , but he escaped a few years later , fled to Canada , and was finally returned to New York to face conspiracy charges for the escape . After two trials , he was acquitted , and a jury pronounced him sane in July 1915 . Harry Thaw was a free man . He died in 1947 . Twenty years later , facing her own death , Evelyn Nesbit made a pronouncement . Stanford White , she said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The ballad of Joe Hill <p> Things could n't have been better  --  for the rich . The economy was roaring . Corporations were fat and happy . But workers felt left out of the good time . Soon they began striking . Corporate chieftains responded swiftly . Company goons and , often , cops weighed in with fists and clubs . <p> Enter Joe Hill . A member of the Industrial Workers of the World , Hill had drifted from job to job , garnering a small measure of fame as an IWW songwriter . Around 10 p.m. on Jan. 10 , 1914 , two men strolled into the Salt Lake City grocery of John G. Morrison and fatally shot him and his son . Three days later , Hill was arrested . The prosecution 's case was thin , based on Hill 's having been treated by a doctor for a gunshot wound shortly after the killings . Hill insisted he was innocent . He had been shot , he said , during a spat over a woman . The explanation did n't wash : A jury convicted Hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was never clear that his union membership played a role in his conviction , but the IWW turned Hill into a martyr for the cause . Messages of support poured in from around the world . Even President Woodrow Wilson asked that Hill be spared  --  to no avail . On Nov. 19 , 1915 , Joe Hill was shot in the heart by a five-man firing squad . Just before his execution , Hill wrote to union leader Big Bill Haywood : " Do n't waste any time mourning  --  organize ! " <p> Haywood knew a thing or two about organizing  --  and about trouble . In 1907 , he was tried for allegedly having ordered the assassination of former Idaho Gov . Frank Steunenberg , who was despised by labor for having called in federal troops to quell union violence . Steunenberg was blown to bits by a bomb . Haywood was acquitted of the crime after his lawyer , Clarence Darrow , delivered an 11-hour closing argument that left some in the courtroom weeping . <p> In the end , though , it was the itinerant songwriter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembered . In 1925 , a young poet named Alfred Hayes wrote the ballad , " I Dreamed I Saw Joe Hill Last Night . " It became a classic , popularized by Joan Baez and Pete Seeger . THE 1920S St. Valentine 's Day Massacre <p> On the morning of Feb. 14 , 1929 , neighbors heard loud blasts coming from a garage at 2122 N. Clark Street in Chicago . They thought it was construction drilling . When Highball , the German shepherd inside the garage , barked mournfully , a neighbor went to investigate . " The place is full of dead men ! " the man cried . Thus was discovered what forever after would be known as the St. Valentine 's Day Massacre . <p> The garage was the headquarters of George " Bugs " Moran . It was there , during Prohibition , that the gangster received crates of illegal hooch , doling it out to speak-easies around the Windy City . Moran was n't in the garage when the bullets started to fly , but afterward , when he was asked who had ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that ! " <p> By then , Al Capone had eliminated almost all his rivals , except his archenemy Moran . The feud between the two was mortal . Moran once tried to knock off Capone by slipping prussic acid into his soup . <p> It was personal , but it was also about money  --  big money . Prohibition began on Jan. 16 , 1920 . Banning booze , it was believed , would cure all the country 's social ills . Many Americans did n't see it that way , and they turned to sipping bathtub gin and frequenting speak-easies . People hid liquor in hip flasks , fake books , and hollow canes , and beneath babies in carriages . Some 200,000 speak-easies sprouted across the nation , requiring huge bootleg operations . <p> That 's where Capone came in . A sixth-grade dropout who once beat up his teacher , he became the nation 's most notorious gangster , with an army of maybe a thousand henchmen . Nicknamed " Scarface " after his left cheek was slashed in a fight over a girl , Capone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> He was n't kidding . On that fateful Valentine 's Day , author Jay Robert Nash says , Capone 's men , some dressed as cops , staged a bogus police raid on Bugs Moran 's garage . " I 'm gon na send Moran a Valentine he will never forget , " Capone reportedly vowed . And he did . There were seven men in the garage at 10:30 that morning . Capone 's boys lined them up against a wall . Evidently thinking the " police " were about to search them , the men complied . Capone 's soldiers opened up with submachine guns . <p> Until then , the country romanticized gangsters . The massacre on Clark Street changed that . People were shocked by the brutality . President Herbert Hoover wanted Capone behind bars . It took a few years , but the feds finally nailed him  --  not for bootlegging or murder but on a tax beef . Scarface wound up doing 11 years . THE 1930S The Lindbergh baby <p> On March 1 , 1932 , Charles Lindbergh Jr. , the beloved 20-month-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as usual , at 7:30 p.m . But when a nurse checked on the blond , curly-haired boy at 10 p.m. , his crib was empty , the window to his second-floor bedroom open . Police found a ransom note on the sill . Whoever took the child wanted $50,000 to bring him back . <p> The kidnapping took place during a bleak time . The country was broke . People peddled apples in the streets . Bread lines sprang up . So hated were the banks that stickup men like John Dillinger were admired . There was no sympathy for a greedy kidnapper , though . What kind of person would steal away in the night with a baby ? <p> Charles Lindbergh paid the $50,000 ransom , the money delivered in marked bills . In return he received a note : The baby was on a boat near Martha 's Vineyard . That was a lie . On May 12 , the baby 's body was found in the woods less than 5 miles from the Lindbergh house . He had a fractured skull and a hole in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boy died the night he was kidnapped . <p> It would take time  --  more than two years  --  but eventually the marked bills turned up . Detectives arrested a Bronx carpenter , Bruno Richard Hauptmann , in September 1934 . When they searched the German immigrant 's modest house , they found thousands of dollars in the marked bills . After a circuslike trial , Hauptmann was found guilty . On April 3 , 1936 , he was sent to the electric chair at the state prison in Trenton , N.J. , and was executed . THE 1940S The Rosenberg spy case <p> Well before Joe McCarthy , but after Winston Churchill christened the Cold War , America was aflame with talk of spies . The Soviet Union was gobbling up Europe . Moscow and Washington were on pins and needles . In the summer of 1949 , the Soviets detonated their first atomic bomb . A year later , communist North Korea stormed into South Korea . America , once again , was at war . <p> And then the Rosenbergs were arrested . Julius was an engineer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York City with his brother-in-law , David Greenglass ; Ethel cared for their two sons , 3 and 7 . The Rosenbergs were tripped up by others ' arrests , but their chief accuser was Greenglass , a small-fish spy who worked on the American atomic bomb project at Los Alamos and fingered his relatives to save himself . Greenglass claimed Julius Rosenberg , a Communist , had recruited him to gather atomic secrets . <p> The FBI arrested Julius in July 1950 ; Ethel was arrested a month later . Their trial began on March 6 , 1951 . The Rosenbergs insisted they were innocent  --  although government documents declassified in 1995 would confirm Julius was indeed a Soviet spy . In the end , both were found guilty and sentenced to death , a severe punishment for espionage , especially since the Soviet Union had been a wartime ally . The Rosenbergs were Jewish , and there was speculation that the presiding judge and a prosecutor , also both Jewish , went overboard to prove Jews were as patriotic and anti-Communist as the rest of the country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nation split between those pleading for their lives and those desperate to see the Rosenbergs die for treason . Many believed the sentence was particularly harsh for Ethel , against whom there was scant evidence . There were demonstrations right up until the moment that the Rosenbergs were executed at Sing Sing Prison on June 19 , 1953 . She was 37 ; he was 35 . Greenglass got 15 years in prison . THE 1950S The lynching of Emmett Till <p> In the hot summer of 1955 , Emmett Till , a 14-year-old black boy from Chicago , went to visit relatives near the tiny town of Money , Miss . Before he left Chicago , his mother kissed him goodbye and warned him to be careful . The South was n't Chicago , she said . On the evening of August 24 , friends urged him to talk to a white woman in a small grocery store . Carolyn Bryant said the boy grabbed her hand and said , " How about a date , baby ? " and gave her a wolf whistle . Others said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roy Bryant considered it an affront to his wife . A few nights later , he and his half brother , J. W. Milam , kidnapped Till from his relatives ' sharecropper home . The two men savagely beat him , shot him behind his ear , and then threw him in the Tallahatchie River . The boy 's body was found several days later with his feet and legs sticking out of the water and a 150-pound cotton gin fan tied around his neck with a piece of barbed wire . A Mississippi sheriff said it appeared that Till 's head had been struck with an ax because " it went too deep to be anything else . " The two men were charged with the slaying . <p> These were bitter times in the South . There were threats , bombings , and killings to pressure blacks to move north . But it was also a time of important social change . In 1954 , the Supreme Court decided Brown v. Board of Education , outlawing segregation in public schools . In December 1955 , Rosa Parks , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her bus seat to a white man in Montgomery , Ala. , prompting the town 's black leaders , including a young preacher named Martin Luther King Jr. , to organize a bus boycott . <p> " The Till case galvanized the country , " says Georgia Rep. John Lewis , a civil rights pioneer beaten by state troopers in Selma , Ala. , during a 1965 march . " A lot of us young black students in the South later on , we were n't sitting in just for ourselves  --  we were sitting in for Emmett Till . We went on Freedom Rides for Emmett Till . " <p> After deliberating for only one hour and seven minutes , the all-white , all-male jury acquitted Bryant and Milam , stunning the rest of the world . After their acquittal , the pair sold their story to Look magazine for $4,000 . Milam recalled saying : " Chicago boy , I 'm tired of ' em sending your kind down here to stir up trouble . Goddamn you , I 'm going to make an example of you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled the church where Till 's body was placed on view . Another 15,000 to 50,000 reportedly had filed past his coffin the night before at a funeral home . His mother had overruled undertakers and insisted on an open casket so others could " see what they did to my boy . " THE 1960S Charles Manson , psycho killer <p> A decade that began by promising to carry on the calm prosperity of the 1950s instead became a caldron of violence and turmoil . The culture was shattered by gunfire with the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy , Martin Luther King Jr. , and Sen. Robert F. Kennedy . At the same time , body bags from Vietnam were piling up from a war that was tearing the nation apart . As deadly race riots charred cities across the country and antiwar protests became increasingly violent , people began to worry that America was spinning out of control . Then came a crime that seemed to confirm those fears by bringing together so many of the social pathologies of the moment . In her book about the era @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many people I know in Los Angeles believe that the Sixties ended abruptly on Aug. 9 , 1969 . . . and in a sense that is true . " That was the day a housekeeper reported for work at film director Roman Polanski 's home in the Hollywood hills and found five bodies , slashed and bloodied . Slain were Polanski 's young wife , actress Sharon Tate , 8 1/2 months pregnant ; her friends , Abigail Folger , the heiress of the Folger coffee fortune , and her playboy boyfriend , Voytek Frykowski ; Jay Sebring , a well-known hairstylist who lived in Hollywood 's fast lane ; and Steve Parent , a young man in the wrong place at the wrong time . They had been beaten and stabbed dozens of times . The word " PIG " was scrawled in blood on the front door . The next night , Leno LaBianca , the owner of a grocery chain , and his wife , Rosemary , were found beaten and stabbed in their home east of Beverly Hills . Again , mysterious words in blood : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " HEALTER SKELTER . " <p> Police still had no suspects two months later when a woman in a Los Angeles jail boasted to a cellmate about her " family 's " murderous ways . It pointed cops to a man in custody for car theft : Charles Manson . <p> Manson was the illegitimate son of a 16-year-old girl . He bounced around from relatives to foster homes to reform schools , robbing at gunpoint by age 13 . He married twice , divorced twice , and had at least two children . By the time he was released from a federal prison in Washington State in 1967 for forging government checks , he had spent 17 of his 32 years in institutions . He moved to the counterculture capital , San Francisco 's Haight-Ashbury district , where he began recruiting his " family " of mostly young women from well-off but troubled families . The wild-eyed Manson used sex to control his flock , who followed him like sheep . Eventually , he took his " family " to live on an old movie set in the mountains north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murders emerged : to leave the impression that blacks had committed them , thus igniting a race war that Manson believed would destroy the country , paving the way for his " family " to take over . He took his cues from what he believed were hidden messages in Beatles ' songs , notably " Helter Skelter . " <p> After a nine-month trial , Manson and three of his acolytes were convicted ; a fifth would be convicted later . All were sentenced to death , but their sentences were commuted to life in prison after the California Supreme Court tossed out capital punishment in 1972 . Vincent Bugliosi , who prosecuted the Manson case , says it still resonates because it 's so " incredibly far out . . . . If this were fiction you would throw it away after 10 pages . " Yet the truth is inescapable . As Bugliosi admits : " Manson has become a metaphor for evil . " THE 1970S A killer called ' Son of Sam ' <p> He was a stocky , cherubic-faced postal clerk who seemed like just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York City for more than a year , killing six young people and wounding seven with a .44-caliber Charter Arms Bulldog revolver . When police finally arrested him on Aug. 10 , 1977 , David Berkowitz was unfazed . " Well , you 've got me , " he shrugged . And with that , the " Son of Sam " siege that had petrified normally jaded New Yorkers was over . <p> Berkowitz was the epitome of a phenomenon that became all too familiar in the edgy , uneasy ' 70s : serial killers . Besides the 24-year-old Berkowitz , there was Ted Bundy , the suave and handsome onetime law student from Washington State , who crisscrossed the country charming , then murdering an estimated 36 to more than 100 young women , including several in a Chi Omega sorority in Florida . There was John Wayne Gacy , the burly contractor who performed as a clown at children 's parties and sexually abused , then killed 33 young men and boys , burying most of them in the crawlspace under his tidy , yellow brick house in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in California , who turned out to be two cousins , Angelo Buono and Kenneth Bianchi , who lured women into their cars by pretending to be undercover cops  --  and then strangled at least 10 of them . <p> Berkowitz struck randomly at night or in the predawn hours , transforming traditionally indifferent New Yorkers into a city of 8 million panic-stricken people . Teens gave up favorite lovers ' lane spots . Some women cut their hair , wore hats to hide it , or routinely wore it up , because he seemed to favor women with long , brown hair . " He was a fat , lumpy , little boy , and he shot young women in their cars when they were n't looking , " says Newsday columnist Jimmy Breslin , who covered the story for the Daily News . <p> Detectives finally caught Berkowitz after tracing a ticket on a cream-colored Ford Galaxy sedan parked illegally at a fire hydrant near his last shooting in Brooklyn to his Yonkers apartment building . When they found the car outside Berkowitz 's suburban flat , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sack and a letter with printing similar to other writings from the mysterious killer , who had identified himself as the Son of Sam . Berkowitz told police that he received " commands " from a man named Sam who lived 6,000 years ago and spoke to him through a dog . Police believed that Berkowitz was obsessed with a neighbor named Sam , who had a dog . After pleading guilty , Berkowitz was sentenced to 25 years to life in prison for each of the six slayings. 1980S Jeffrey Dahmer , cannibal <p> He was a former chocolate factory worker with a fetish for flesh . In his putrid , one-bedroom apartment in Milwaukee , he saved painted skulls and severed heads , including one stashed in the fridge next to a box of baking soda . He had a kettle and a freezer of body parts . He stored torsos in a vat of acid . He drilled holes in his victims ' heads and had sex with dead bodies . He chewed on body parts , once using Crisco and meat tenderizer on a biceps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeffrey Dahmer , alone in his poisoned world , was monstrous , repulsive , depraved . But the most frightening thing about Dahmer is what he was not : insane . He was objectively judged to be sane . He did what he did with his wits intact . " He was a man who made a decision that he would satisfy himself , " says E. Michael McCann , the Milwaukee district attorney who put Dahmer away in 1992 . " He liked sex with dead bodies . It was the ultimate in self-indulgence . " <p> In an interview with NBC 's Dateline in March 1994 , Dahmer said lust drove him to lure his victims , most of them black and gay , from bars , bus stops , and shopping malls , to his apartment , where he drugged , strangled , and dismembered them . " Once it happened the first time , it just seemed like it had control of my life from there on in , " he said . " The killing was just a means to an end . That was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's why I tried to create living zombies with . . . acid and the drill . " <p> His killing spree started in 1978 with an 18-year-old hitchhiker whom Dahmer met and brought home for a few beers . Dahmer , who had just graduated from high school , battered him with a barbell , cut up the body , and scattered the crushed bones behind his parents ' house . By the time he was arrested on July 22 , 1991 , after a man he had handcuffed escaped from his apartment and flagged down a police car , Dahmer had killed 17 men and boys . He confessed , saying simply , " I carried it too far , that 's for sure . " <p> The only issue at his 1992 trial was whether to accept his plea that he was criminally insane  --  and therefore not responsible for his revolting actions . Dr. Park Dietz , a respected California forensic psychiatrist , determined that he was not insane . " Dahmer was quiet , introverted , and performed his job pretty well until he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could n't keep up with his nighttime dastardly deeds , " says prosecutor McCann . <p> Dahmer was serving 16 consecutive life terms when inmates beat him to death in a prison bathroom in November 1994 . Two years later , a businessman offered more than $400,000 to buy his implements  --  the refrigerator , the vats , the drills , the saws  --  to prevent a public auction . They were secretly buried . THE 1990S The O. J. Simpson case <p> It was a foggy June night in 1994 when Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman were slashed to death outside her Brentwood , Calif. , condo . There were no witnesses , but many clues : bloody shoe prints and glove , a knit cap . When police later noticed cuts on the left hand of Nicole 's estranged husband , O. J. Simpson , it started a chain of events that 's still reverberating . <p> It turned out that a trail of blood drops leading away from the bodies appeared to match the mighty former football player 's blood type . Detective Mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the bloody glove at Simpson 's posh Brentwood mansion . DNA experts testified that there was blood from the victims at Simpson 's house and in the white Ford Bronco in which he had led police on a surreal televised freeway chase after the murders . And prosecutors showed he had a history of slapping his wife around . <p> The 1990s have seen terrorism in the United States  --  at the World Trade Center and at the federal office building in Oklahoma City . It has also been a time when angry , alienated boys opened fire on classmates in Columbine High and other schools . But it was the Simpson case  --  a tangled tale of money , power , celebrity , race , domestic abuse , media madness  --  that captured America 's perverse fascination with the famous . It started as a macabre parlor game that , thanks to cameras in the courtroom , everyone could play . But as the case evolved , it became a racially tinged referendum on the American justice system . <p> " What made it unusual was O.J. , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote a book about the case . " The murder was very garden-variety . " The football star turned Hertz pitchman hired a colorful cadre of high-priced legal talent dubbed the " Dream Team . " The televised 13-month trial , presided over by Superior Court Judge Lance Ito , was the most widely watched criminal proceeding in history . Simpson 's lawyers accused the police of bungling the investigation . Forensic experts pointed to sloppiness that could have compromised blood samples ; the bloody glove did n't seem to fit ; Fuhrman was a disastrous witness . <p> The jury deliberated for only a few hours before acquitting Simpson . A civil jury later disagreed , finding Simpson liable for both deaths and ordering him to cough up $33.5 million in damages . He sold his mansion , lost his Heisman trophy , and now lives not far from the murder scene with his and Nicole 's two children . Did he get away with murder ? That 's the question of the century . THE NEXT CENTURY Millennial madness ? <p> It 's hard to say where things are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steadily , but the experts believe it 's best to hold off popping the champagne for now . They worry that the reasons for the drop could shift the other way . Will the economy remain strong ? Is there another deadly menace on the horizon , like crack during the 1980s ? Might crime surge because of the massive welfare overhaul ? <p> In looking back at the past 100 years , one thing stands out : Man 's capacity for cruelty seems fairly constant . In fact , some experts note that the extraordinarily brutal crimes  --  such as Charles Manson 's blood bath , Son of Sam and his spinoffs  --  appear to have increased since World War II . " The crimes that scare us most  --  those by strangers  --  are on the rise : serial killings and mass killings , " says historian Roger Lane .
