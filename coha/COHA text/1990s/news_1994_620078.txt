<p> Cricket players are a kind lot . With baseball season officially over , they could use this opportunity to gloat , to shout to the world that their sport  --  inherently linked to baseball in spirit and form  --  is free of egomania and salary problems , that cricket is still being played with wild abandon ( well , maybe not wild  --  maybe joyous is more like it ) around the Bay Area every weekend . <p> But gloat not , these cricket players . Not only are they gentlemanly , they 're a little on the staid side . Passive , even  --  which sort of reflects their sport . <p> " The spotlight is something we 'd like to take advantage of , " says Mike Miller , who runs the Marin Cricket Club . " As usual , though , cricket is a little slow to do things . " <p> Which is why this most English of games may never catch on in the United States  --  certainly not the way it has in former British colonies . In countries like India @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 6 play cricket all day in parks and streets and tiny alleyways . The sport is televised as often as possible , and newspaper accounts of important international matches are biblical ( " India Falls to Pakistan ! ! " ) in tone and reverence . <p> In the United States , cricket is nothing  --  which as any knowledgeable cricketer will tell you is painfully ironic . It turns out that the first international cricket match ever played was between Canada and ( you guessed it ) the United States . The year : 1844 . In fact , the United States was once a beacon of cricketness . In the late 1700s and early 1800s , Americans were cricket crazy . Reportedly , cricket was this country 's first organized sport . A fun historical fact : During the Constitutional Convention , when Thomas Jefferson and his colleagues were debating whether America should have a presidency , someone yelled , " Well , even cricket clubs have presidents ! " <p> Cricketers do n't claim credit for establishing the U.S. presidency , but they could  --  probably yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it seems , to play cricket and leave the showboating and grandstanding to others . <p> Deion Sanders ? John McEnroe ? Wo n't find players like that in cricket . <p> To play this sport , certainly to watch it , one needs the patience of a poet . <p> " Some people say that cricket is like walking chess , " says Jim Cattlin , customer-relations manager for Qantas Airways in San Francisco , and a prominent member of the Australian Consulate 's cricket squad . <p> FIVE-DAY MATCHES <p> Although one-day cricket matches have become increasingly common , international matches often last five days ( the players get to go home for dinner and to sleep ) . Bay Area cricketers usually play one-day matches that go from late morning to early evening . <p> " I do n't think cricket will catch on like baseball here , " says T.R. Ramesh , who learned the game while growing up in India , and who plays in San Jose , where he works as a design engineer . " The length of the game is ( problematic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sit through a game . . . . People even complain about an NFL game going on for 3 1/2 hours , and that 's probably one inning in cricket ! " <p> To break up the monotony , cricket features regular tea breaks . Yes  --  tea breaks . This is an English game , after all . <p> " It 's funny that people find this amusing , " says Richard Williams , an Australian who also works for Qantas Airways . " You bring sandwiches , scones , stuff like that . Then you have tea on the boil . " <p> DIFFERENCES ABOUND <p> There are other fundamental differences between cricket and baseball  --  as was made clear during a Saturday match between the British Consulate and the Australian Consulate at Piper Park in Larkspur ( the place to play cricket  --  part of it is reserved just for cricket , and the views of the Marin hills are priceless ) . <p> For example : <p> * Gloves : There are n't any in cricket . Players have to rough it when they catch a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can go as fast as 100 miles per hour . Ouch . The only person allowed to wear a glove is the catcher ( or " wicket keeper " as he is known ) . " There are a lot of injuries ( in cricket ) , " says Ramesh . " Broken fingers , dislocations . " Yet cricket players would never wear gloves . It 's a machismo thing . " Oh , no , " says Allen Weedy , who plays for the Golden Gate Cricket Club . " It would n't be cricket anymore . Whenever people talk about baseball , we say , ' we do n't need gloves to field . ' " <p> * Terminology : Lots of almost surreal names and terms in cricket , like bowler ( what cricketers calls their pitchers ) and wicket ( the trio of sticks behind the batter  --  a sort of home plate ) and over ( the number of pitches thrown at a batter  --  usually six ) . The most absurd : Silly Mid On . It 's the name of the fielder closest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that the fielder " has to be crazy and silly " to play so close to the batter . <p> * The Ball : Cricket balls are red and hard , about the size and weight of a baseball . The biggest difference : In cricket , only one ball is used during a game , which means that as the game progresses the ball loses some of its elasticity . Bowlers say that old balls do n't move as fast , and are thus easier to hit . Spit balls , by the way , are illegal in cricket , just as they are in baseball . But just like in baseball , bowlers will resort to it . Sand paper , too . " S  --  happens , " jokes Cattlin . <p> * Pitching Strategy : The goal is to get the batter out , of course . The most skillful way is to hit the wicket with the ball , knocking down the bales ( small pieces of wood perched atop the wickets ) . Not easy . During the Australia-vs. - Britain game at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blooper pitch high in the air that the batter , sort of Casey-and-the-bat- like , flailed at and missed . <p> SPIN IS THE THING <p> Blooper pitches are rare , though . In cricket , the spin 's the thing . Cricket bowlers use different grips and arm/wrist movements that produce weird , almost centrifugal spins . Bowlers run up to the pitching line long-jump-like to get momentum before tossing the ball . And they fire the ball to the ground near the batter so that it spins viciously past or toward him . ( In cricket , it 's OK to use the ground on a pitch . In fact it 's more common than not . It 's also OK to hit the batter . Seriously . That 's why batsmen wear padding . And , says Ramesh laughing , " the batsman never will charge the bowler . " ) <p> Here 's the rub : it 's hard to get a batter out , because batters get to decide whether to run on a hit ball . It 's called batter 's choice . During an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground balls directly to fielders before deciding to run on a well-hit ball that gets past everyone . <p> That 's why during a five-day international test match , some batters will bat all day . During one- day matches , it 's not uncommon for some batters to bat two hours . <p> * Runs : They score lots of them in cricket . Lots . A half-hour into the Britain-vs. - Austrailia match at Piper , Australia ( clearly the better team ) scored 60 runs . You score a run every time a batter runs successfully to the opposite batting mark . A cricket home run counts as six . A ball hit past the boundary line scores four . And get this : in cricket , batters can hit the ball in any direction . Behind them is perfectly fine . A hit that looks like a foul tip is often the cricket equivalent of a grand slam . <p> * Uniforms : Pearl-white uniforms are all but required wear . In casual games , players can wear shorts , but for the most part it 's white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now feature multicolored uniforms  --  even corporate logos on uniforms  --  but all-white is still preferred . ) Jean Wong , president of the Southern California Cricket Association , relates this story about Erroll Flynn , who was a rabid cricket player in the days when Hollywood was run by actors who loved cricket : " He once appeared for a match in some type of Hollywood get-up , and Sir Aubrey Smith ( the team captain ) promptly sent him home , saying , ' You ca n't play in this game . ' " <p> SEASONS COINCIDE <p> The cricket season , by the way , is the same as baseball . April through October . Sometimes the sports intersect . A few years ago , a cricket exhibition was played before a Giants game at Candlestick Park , to celebrate Aussie-American day . Before that , Pakistan  --  which has been world champion a number of years  --  played an exhibition at the Los Angeles Coliseum that drew about 10,000 fans . <p> Weedy and others think cricket could fill a vacuum . " I 'm sure if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest level , they 'd be excited , " says Weedy . " And I like baseball , but I definitely find cricket more exciting . . . For example , there 's no such thing as a foul ball in cricket . That slows baseball down . " <p> Cricket has mushroomed in popularity in the Bay Area , perhaps because there are many more expatriates from other countries who now live here . " I 've been here 25 years , " says Weedy . " When I got here , there were eight teams and one division ( in the Northern California Cricket Association ) . Now there are 18 teams and two divisions . " <p> There is also a Pub League for players who do n't quite have the skill  --  or the desire  --  to play competitively . <p> Still , because cricket is played in tucked-away spots like Piper Park , the sport is an undiscovered gem . There are only about 12 cricket fields in the Bay Area , but they 'll be awash in players as the Northern California Cricket Association playoffs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clubs will next month celebrate the 150th anniversary of the U.S.- vs. - Canada match . <p> For at least a little while in the United States , cricket will be king again . <p> WHERE TO WATCH CRICKET <p> * The three best venues to watch cricket are Piper Park in Larkspur , home ground for the Marin Cricket Club ( games Saturday and Sunday ) ; Lamoine Park in El Sobrante , home ground for the Golden Gate Cricket Club ( games Sunday ) ; and Williamson Adult Educational Center Park in Santa Clara , home of the Santa Clara Cricket Club ( games Saturday and Sunday ) <p> * The Northern California Cricket Association playoffs begin Sunday , September 25 , and last four weeks . <p> * The 150th anniversary of the first international cricket match , between the United States and Canada , will be celebrated in the Bay Area either October 8 or 9 at one of the three venues above , with a match between British Columbia and a representative team from the NCCA . <p> * For more information on cricket , contact Sanjay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 510-754-4543.
