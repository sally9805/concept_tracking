One of our last car trips , near the end of my father 's life as a man , we stopped by a river , and we took a walk to its banks , where we sat in the shade of an old oak tree . After a couple of minutes my father took off his shoes and his socks and placed his feet in the clear-running water , and he looked at them there . Then he closed his eyes and smiled . I had n't seen him smile like that in a while . Suddenly he took a deep breath and said , " This reminds me . " And then he stopped , and thought some more . Things came slow for him then if they ever came at all , and I guessed he was thinking of some joke to tell , because he always had some joke to tell . Or he might tell me a story that would celebrate his adventurous and heroic life . And I wondered , What does this remind him of ? Does it remind him of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar ? The boy who was knee-high to a grasshopper ? Did it remind him of the dinosaur egg he found one day , then lost , or the country he once ruled for the better part of a week ? " This reminds me , " he said , " of when I was a boy . " I looked at this old man , my old man with his old white feet in this clear-running stream , these moments among the very last in his life , and I thought of him suddenly , and simply , as a boy , a child , a youth , with his whole life ahead of him , much as mine was ahead of me . I 'd never done that before . And these images -- the now and then of my father -- converged , and at that moment he turned into a weird creature , wild , concurrently young and old , dying and newborn . My father became a myth . I The Day He Was Born He was born during the driest summer in forty years . The sun baked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no water for miles . Food was scarce , too . No corn or tomatoes or even squash that summer , all of it withered beneath the hazy white sky . Everything died , seemed like : chickens first , then cats , then pigs , and then dogs . Went into the stew , though , the lot , bones and all . One man went crazy , ate rocks , and died . It took ten men to carry him to his grave he was so heavy , ten more to dig it , it was so dry . Looking east people said , Remember that rolling river ? Looking west , Remember Talbert 's Pond ? The day he was born began as just another day . The sun rose , peered down on the little wooden house where a wife , her belly as big as the country , scrambled up the last egg they had for her husband 's breakfast . The husband was already out in the field , turning the dust with his plow round the black and twisted roots of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he came in for his egg he wiped the sweat from his brow with a ragged blue bandanna . Then he wrung the sweat from it and let it drip into an old tin cup . For something to drink , later on . The day he was born the wife 's heart stopped , briefly , and she died . Then she came back to life . She 'd seen her self suspended above herself . She saw her son , too -- said he glowed . When her self rejoined with herself she said she felt a warmth there . Said , " Soon . He 'll be here soon . " She was right . The day he was born someone spotted a cloud over thataway , with something of a darkness to it . People gathered to watch . One , two , two times two , suddenly fifty people and more , all looking skyward , at this rather small cloud moving close to their parched and frazzled home place . The husband came out to look , too . And there it was : a cloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that whole town not cloud-watching was the wife . She had fallen to the floor , breathless with pain . So breathless she could n't scream . She thought she was screaming -- she had her mouth open that way -- but nothing was coming out . Of her mouth . Elsewhere , though , she was busy . With him . He was coming . And where was her husband ? Out looking at a cloud . That was some cloud , too . Not small at all , really , a respectable cloud , looming large and gray over all the dried-up acres . The husband took off his hat and squinted , taking a step down off the porch for a better look . The cloud brought a little wind with it , too . It felt good . A little wind brushing gently across their faces felt good . And then the husband heard thunder -- boom ! or so he thought . But what he heard was his wife kicking over a table with her legs . Sure sounded like thunder , though . That 's what it sounded like . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Husband ! " his wife screamed then at the top of her lungs . But it was too late . Husband was too far gone and could n't hear . He could n't hear a thing . The day he was born all the people of the town gathered in the field outside his house , watching the cloud . Small at first , then merely respectable , the cloud soon turned huge , whale-size at least , churning strikes of white light within it and suddenly breaking and burning the tops of pine trees and worrying some of the taller men out there ; watching , they slouched , and waited . The day he was born things changed . Husband became Father , Wife became Mom . The day Edward Bloom was born , it rained . In Which He Speaks to Animals My father had a way with animals , everybody said so . When he was a boy , raccoons ate out of his hand . Birds perched on his shoulder as he helped his own father in the field . One night , a bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? He knew the animals ' special language . He had that quality . Cows and horses took a peculiar liking to him as well . Followed him around et cetera . Rubbed their big brown noses against his shoulder and snorted , as if to say something specially to him . A chicken once sat in my father 's lap and laid an egg there -- a little brown one . Never seen anything like it , nobody had . The Year It Snowed in Alabama It never snowed in Alabama and yet it snowed the winter my father was nine . It came down in successive white sheets , hardening as it fell , eventually covering the landscape in pure ice , impossible to dig out of . Caught below the snowy tempest you were doomed ; above it , you merely had time to consider your doom . Edward was a strong , quiet boy with a mind of his own , but not one to talk back to his father when a chore needed doing , a fence mended , a stray heifer lured back home . As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next morning , Edward and his father first built snowmen and snow towns and various other constructions , realizing only later that day the immensity and danger of the unabating snowfall . But it 's said that my father 's snowman was a full sixteen feet tall . In order to reach that height , he had engineered a device made out of pine branches and pulleys , with which he was able to move up and down at will . The snowman 's eyes were made out of old wagon wheels , abandoned for years ; its nose was the top of a grain silo ; and its mouth -- in a half-smile , as if the snowman were thinking of something warm and humorous -- was the bark cut from the side of an oak tree . His mother was inside cooking . Smoke rose from the chimney in streams of gray and white , curling into the sky . She heard a distant picking and scraping outside the door , but was too busy to pay it much mind . Did n't even look up when her husband and son came in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We 've got ourselves a situation , " her husband said . " Well , " she said , " tell me about it . " Meanwhile , the Snow continued to fall and the door they 'd just dug through to was nearly blocked again . His father took the shovel and cleared a passage again . Edward watched -- Father shovel , snow fall , Father shovel , snow fall -- until the roof of the cabin itself started creaking . His mother found that a snowdrift had formed in their bedroom . They reckoned it was time they got out . But where to ? All the living world was ice now , pure white and frozen . His mother packed up the food she 'd been cooking and gathered together some blankets . They spent that night in the trees . The next morning was a Monday . The snow stopped , the sun rose . The temperature hovered below zero . Mother said , " About time you got off to school , is n't it Edward ? " " I guess it is , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of boy he was . After breakfast he climbed down from the tree and walked the six miles to the little schoolhouse . Saw a man frozen in a block of ice on the way there . About froze himself , too -- did n't , though . He made it . He was a couple of minutes early , in fact . And there was his schoolmaster , sitting on a wood pile , reading . All he could see of the schoolhouse was the weather vane , the rest of it buried beneath the weekend 's snowfall . " Morning , Edward , " he said . " Morning , " Edward said . And then he remembered : he 'd forgotten his homework . Went back home to get it . True story . His Great Promise They say he never forgot a name or a face or your favorite color , and that by his twelfth year he knew everybody in his home town by the sound their shoes made when they walked . They say he grew so tall so quickly that for a time -- months ? the better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed because the calcification of his bones could not keep up with his height 's ambition , so that when he tried to stand he was like a dangling vine and would fall to the floor in a heap . Edward Bloom used his time wisely , reading . He read almost every book there was in Ashland . A thousand books -- some say ten thousand . History , Art , Philosophy . Horatio Alger . It did n't matter . He read them all . Even the telephone book . They say that eventually he knew more than anybody , even Mr. Pinkwater , the librarian . He was a big fish , even then .
