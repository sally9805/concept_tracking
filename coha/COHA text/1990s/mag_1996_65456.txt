A Couple of weeks ago New Jersey Devils goaltender Martin Brodeur noticed slumping Devils right wing St ? phane Richer moping around , grim as a tax audit , so brodeur made him a deal : He would pay Richer $100 for every goal he scored , if Richer would give Brodeur $100 for every game Brodeur won . After Richer 's hat trick in a 6-4 victory over the Tampa Bay lightning on March 26 , Brodeur , the winning goalie , found himself $200 in the hole . // Richer , the sullen sniper on hockey 's most buttoned-down team , agreed to settle for a dress shirt instead of cash , but Brodeur returned from prowling the stores the next afternoon empty-handed . " That was tough , " Brodeur says of shopping for Richer . " It 's like buying a present for your wife . " // The Devils : You ca n't dress them up , and you might not even be able to take them out . To the big playoff dance , that is . Instead of fine-tuning for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their asphyxiating trap  --  the defending Stanley Cup champions find themselves in a frenzied game of musical chairs as one of four teams chasing the final three Eastern Conference playoff slots . The top sight teams in each conference qualify for the postseason , and through Sunday the Devils ( 34-29-12 ) were eighth , but only one point out of ninth . When the music stops at the end of the regular season on April 14 , New Jersey could become the first team since the 1970 Montreal Canadiens to miss the playoffs the year after winning the Stanley Cup . " That 's not the kind of thing you want to go down in history for , " says Devils right wing Bill Guerin. // Their recent record suggests New Jersey will be spared that ignominy . Indeed , all the vital signs point to playoff success : As of Sunday the Devils had lost only four of their past 17 games , were an impressive 7-0-12 in overtime this season , were ranked second to the powerful Detroit Red Wings in goals-against average , had the best record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had the second-best road record in the NHL ( 9-4-6 ) since Jan. 1 . // " You ca n't count them out in the playoffs , " Pittsburgh Penguins center Ron Francis says . " Having won the Cup before , they know what it takes to do it . They 're better prepared to handle all the mental things that crop up . They also have great goal-tending and defense . They 're dangerous . " // But the numbers from the Devils ' 10-week surge may be illusory , masking an inconsistency that still plagues them . Last Thursday , New Jersey allowed the Blues to hold a kiddies ' skating party in a 4-4 tie , permitting St. Louis 31 shots in the first two periods and 10 terrific scoring chances ( resulting in one goal ) in the second . The Blues ' four goals all came from the slot , the sector the rugged Devils defense is supposed to sweep . New Jersey players have been uttering all the right locker room quotes about their desperation , but they played the first 40 minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The next day in Pittsburgh , coach Jacques Lemaire only hinted at his frustration , fearful any careless public words might upset some players . You just hope his feet are more callused than his team . On the way out of the Civic Arena after practice , Lemaire expressed himself more freely , kicking a metal dolly . // After sipping champagne from hockey 's chalice , any team can get a whopping Stanley Cup hangover . The complacent feeling mingles with the resolve of opponents who want to knock you down a peg , and the next thing you 're doing is reaching for the excuses along with the Tylenol . The champion Canadiens had just such a hangover in 1994 , losing to the Boston Bruins in the first playoff round . The New York Rangers had it in 1995 when they staggered to the last playoff spot and were whipped by the Philadelphia Flyers in the second round . The Devils could be where their despised New York neighbors were a year ago . If they do make the playoffs , how much will they have left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Blues goalie Grant Fuhr 's consecutive-start record , but Brodeur has started 37 straight games and played in 70 of 75 this season . Many of them have been cliff-hangers : Thirty-seven Devils games have been decided by no more than one goal . " The way things have gone , " New Jersey assistant coach Chris Nilan says , ' it 's like we 've been playing playoff games since the All-Star break . " // The pressure has created tension is Lemaire has taken away and given ice time in bursts , a punishment-reward system that has raised hackles and some eyebrows . He benched Guerin , a first-line right wing , for the second half of the victory over the Lightning . Three weeks ago , in a 3-0 loss to the Florida Panthers that ended a 10-game unbeaten run , he sat Richer for the entire third period . Lemaire explained that he had n't liked the way Richer had warmed up before the game . Of course Lemaire meant that Richer had n't awakened in the two periods after a desultory warmup , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strawberries . // Lemaire , a Hall of Fame center who won eight Stanley Cup rings with the Montreal Canadiens , is no Queeg . But he is n't exactly running McHale 's Navy , either . In a memorable locker room oration earlier this season , Lemaire told the Devils he was n't there to be a friend or a father figure but to be a guide to a second Stanley Cup . There is no warm and fuzzy in Lemaire 's cold game of ice hockey . // " If you fail to complete one pass , you can get into Jacques 's bad books , " defenseman Ken Daneyko says . " That 's happened to a lot of guys because we 've been inconsistent . You play 22 minutes one night , think you 've been solid , and the next game , you play 10 minutes because you 're up against a different team and Jacques sees a different situation . You ca n't argue with him . I 've tried "  --  Daneyko laughs  --  " but he 's pushed all the right buttons since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This is n't the military , but almost , " Brodeur says . " For Jacques , everyone has to be the same . " // The troops almost all went AWOL right before the All-Star break when Lemaire scheduled practice the day after a disappointing loss to the Bruins . The players had thought they would have the day off for a head start on their hiatus , and veteran center Neal Broten , who had plans to go to Florida with his family , announced he was skipping practice . There was widespread sentiment that the team should boycott the practice in solidarity . Sanity prevailed , but as Guerin says , " All the guys were behind Brotsie who was lined $3,500 and did not dress for one game . It blew over in a couple of days , but it was great the way the guys stuck together . The whole thing did n't hurt us at all . " // Maybe it helped . Or maybe the five days off gave the Devils a different perspective . Certainly New Jersey returned from the break a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further transform in the next two months . The Devils ' inept offense was becoming even more of a hallmark than their neutral-zone trap , so on Feb. 26 Lamoriello made a trade with the Calgary Flames for offensive defenseman Phil Housley , and two weeks later he sent two draft picks to the Toronto Maple Leafs for former 50-goal left wing Dave Andreychuk . Housley , 32 , is the anti-Devil , a gifted but undisciplined defenseman who loves to lug the puck and gamble . However , except for one egregious error  --  leaving the puck outside Brodeur 's crease in the tie with St. Louis  --  he has smothered his impulses and fit in well . Housley will be an unrestricted free agent after the season and will test the market , but the 32-year-old Andreychuk , who at week 's end had three goals in eight games for New Jersey , represents a commitment by the team . The Devils will pay him $7.2 million over the next three seasons . // Lamoriello found another offensive fix  --  one that was smaller and cheaper  --  in 21-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recalled from the Albany River Rats of the American Hockey League last month and scored five goals in his first 12 games , including a breakaway against the Lightning . " I call him the human highlight film , " says teammate Randy McKay , who must be watching on a 12-inch screen . The yappy , combative Sullivan is listed at 5 ' 9 " but is actually a mere 5 ' 7 " . He was cut from a bantam team in Timmons , Ont. , at age 15 because he was too small . Despite his game-winner in Tampa , Sullivan played only sparingly against the Blues and was scratched in a 2-1 loss to Pittsburgh last Saturday in favor of another small but effective rookie , 5 ' 11 " , 183-pound Petr Sykora. // When he came to the Devils , Lemaire took the traditional 1-2-2 forechecking scheme and refined it into a dynamic , counterattacking system for his big , fast but not overwhelmingly skilled players . The problem is , the makeup of his squad has changed . " You have to remember , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says of a team whose forwards averaged nine pounds more per man than Detroit 's in last season 's Stanley Cup finals . " Claude Lemieux the Conn Smythe Trophy winner as Stanley Cup MVP who was traded last October in a three-team deal for 5 ' 11 " , 184-pound Steve Thomas is gone , and he was 6 ' 2 " , 215 . We 've got Sully and Sykora . Our big guys like Mike Peluso and Bobby Holik have had injuries . Maybe Thomas will be even better than Lemieux in the playoffs , but you have to wait and see . Who knows ? " // For a Stanley Cup champion , it is a weird mantra . But really , who does know ? In the one-game-at-a-time Eastern Conference , only the Flyers seem to be peaking at the right time . The Rangers have been slumping . Pittsburgh has defensive deficiencies . There is no ? berteam . A spot in the Cup finals is there for the taking if New Jersey makes the playoffs . And that looks promising , considering the Devils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are against nonplayoff teams . // " I do n't believe in the philosophy of flicking a switch , but I 've seen it happen  --  to us , last year , " New Jersey captain Scott Stevens says . " We were fifth in the conference , and then we go up to Boston to start the playoffs , and we have this unbelievable practice . Crisp . All the passes on the sticks . Afterward I said to our coaches , ' Is this our team ? ' " // Lemaire , for one , does n't need any further spark to motivate him . He was on the 1970 Canadien team that despite earning 92 points during a 76-game schedule , missed the playoffs . More than a quarter of a century later , it is still too painful for him to discuss . // His players , however , are talking with confidence . " I would n't want to play us , " says Daneyko . " We 're built for the playoffs . We 're tough to beat in a long series . " Unfortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prove that .
