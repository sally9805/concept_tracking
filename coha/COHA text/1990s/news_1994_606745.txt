<p> A terror bombing on a crowded commuter bus tore through the commercial center of Tel Aviv at the height of this morning 's rush hour , killing at least 20 people and prompting Israel to seal its borders with the Gaza Strip and West Bank . <p> The explosion , an apparent suicide attack by a passenger , mangled the bus , damaged another passing in the opposite direction and shattered shop fronts near Dizengoff Square on Tel Aviv 's main shopping boulevard at 9 a.m. ( 3 a.m . EDT ) . Police said at least 48 people were wounded , some maimed or seriously burned . <p> Rescue and burial teams worked for hours to collect the casualties in a grisly scene of blood and destruction . The red-and-white No. 5 bus , which wound a route from the central terminal through downtown Tel Aviv , was little more than a blackened skeleton . The other bus , which absorbed some of the blast , stood immobilized , its windshield shattered . <p> The attack was the third claimed by the Islamic Resistance Movement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the heaviest in violence between Israelis and Palestinians since February , when a Jewish extremist killed 29 Arab worshipers at the Tomb of the Patriarchs mosque in the Israeli-occupied West Bank town of Hebron . <p> Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin , who rushed home from a visit to Britain after the bombing , vowed harsher measures against Hamas suspects and their families and again demanded a similar crackdown by Yasser Arafat 's limited self-rule authority in Gaza and the West Bank town of Jericho . <p> Arafat , who has put his leadership on the line to continue the peace process with Israel and is struggling with rejectionists in Hamas , denounced the attack , which coincided with the return of Israeli and Palestinian negotiators to talks on self-rule in the West Bank . Israel Defense Forces Radio reported that Arafat tried to place a condolence call to Israeli President Ezer Weizman but that Weizman refused to come to the phone . <p> Rabin stood firm against domestic critics of continuing peace talks with Arafat . After opposition leaders demanded a halt to the talks and permanent Israeli dominion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ television appearance to call for clearer partition between Israelis and Palestinians . <p> " Israel today wants separation , not a temporary closure of borders , but a different way of life , " he said from his office at Tel Aviv 's Defense Ministry . " What will be the future  --  separation or a continued blurring of the lines ? He who wants to swallow 2 million Arabs into Israel , that will be giving Hamas the maximum support . " <p> About 28,000 residents of Gaza cross into Israel daily to work at construction and agricultural jobs . Rabin said Israelis should reduce their dependency on cheap Palestinian labor , and he portrayed the self-rule talks as a way to create territorial lines that neither side would cross . He appeared to be saying , in effect , that Palestinians should not live and work among Israelis , nor Israelis among Palestinians . <p> Arafat , in an apparent reference to Iran 's role keeping Middle East tension alive , said : " Pushing forward with the peace process and implementing the rest of the agreement is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are getting their support , their training and financing from well-known outside parties , " the Associated Press reported . <p> In Washington , President Clinton , who is scheduled to visit Israel next week , called the bombing " an outrage against the conscience of the world . " <p> It was unclear tonight whether domestic backlash over today 's attack , which follows a machine-gun assault on a Jerusalem pedestrian mall and the abduction and killing of a 19-year-old Israeli soldier , will limit Rabin 's room to maneuver . <p> In the heat of their anger , many Israelis interviewed today expressed frustration with the fruits of peace and Rabin 's strategy for securing citizens against attack . <p> " Look , I voted for Labor , but I 'm a little sorry about it , " said Dmitri Karamazen , 20 , a soldier who hovered protectively over his unconscious girlfriend , Stanislava Shmakin , after she was brought from the bombing site to Tel Aviv 's Sourasky Hospital . " They 're not showing their strength ; they 're not using their force the way they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prime minister Yitzhak Shamir did n't do enough for peace , but during his time we did n't have incidents like this . " <p> Opposition leaders  --  who rallied around Rabin last week as the nation waited to learn the fate of Cpl . Nachshon Waxman , the abducted soldier who was ultimately slain  --  blamed Rabin today for the bombing attack in harsh and personal terms . <p> " I told him not to lift the closure of Gaza last week because it would result in a catastrophe , " Likud leader Binyamin Netanyahu said in an interview on Dizengoff Street , where he strode grimly through the carnage . " It has just resulted in a catastrophe . There is no difference between Hamas and the PLO ; they both want a Palestinian state as a prelude to our destruction . " <p> Neither Netanyahu nor official government accounts identified the person who carried out the bombing or his place of residence . But Netanyahu , and to some extent Rabin , have charged that Gaza is the nerve center of Hamas and its military operatives . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to murder the peace , " said Alon Tsabari , 29 , who helped pull some of the injured to safety . " They are trying to murder Jews . They have been doing it for more than 100 years . " <p> In claims of responsibility telephoned to radio stations and broadcast from loudspeakers atop Gaza 's Palestine Mosque , Hamas boasted that it had learned the art of making car bombs as a result of the deportation of some of its key members to southern Lebanon in 1992 . A Hamas leaflet said the man who built the bomb was Yehiya Ayash , from the West Bank town of Rafat , who has been wanted by Israeli authorities for two years . <p> " If you go to the street in Gaza and look at the faces of the people , you will find smiles , " said Fayed Abu Shamala , a local Hamas leader . <p> Some Israeli officials warned of vengeance to come . Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said Israel will " not hesitate to find those responsible for this terrible action . " Weizman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country will have to take " extraordinary action " to locate the roots of Islamic extremist groups and " rip them to pieces . " <p> Rabin , too , spoke of cracking down on Hamas , and he asked for the easing of legal restraints on Israeli security forces in dealing with terror suspects . Noting that the Shin Bet intelligence service had captured and interrogated the driver of the car in which Waxman was abducted , Rabin spoke dismissively of a 1987 commission report calling for a ban on torture of suspects but permitting " moderate physical and psychological pressure . " <p> " If we 'd been so careful to follow the Landau Commission , we would never have found out where Waxman was being held , " Rabin said . Waxman 's captors shot him to death as Israeli commandos raided their hideout in Bir Nabalah in the West Bank . <p> Rabin said he would seek legislation to permit greater latitude in interrogations and wider use of collective punishment  --  particularly demolition of homes of relatives and associates of Israel 's attackers . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own lives , but also their family 's homes , " he said . <p> Human Rights Watch , a U.S.-based group , said tonight that it is " gravely concerned " that Rabin 's proposals could " cause a severe deterioration in the human rights situation in the occupied lands . " <p> But perhaps the most striking theme in the government 's response was that of national separation . Lt. Gen. Ehud Barak , the army chief of staff and a close Rabin ally , told Israeli television it is perhaps time to " reexamine the entire set of our relations with the Palestinians , which allow daily tens of thousands of Palestinians to come to and from Israel to work . Clearly if there are no Palestinians who work in Israel , it will be more difficult " for terrorists to infiltrate .
