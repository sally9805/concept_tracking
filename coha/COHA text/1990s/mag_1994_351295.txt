The night before David Boren officially declared last week that he will leave the Senate to preside over the University of Oklahoma , he got a congratulatory call from President Clinton . The President was " really happy " for Boren , he said . But Clinton 's feelings were probably much more complicated than that . While the President will be sending off an often rebellious Democratic colleague who opposed him on last year 's budget bill , Boren could be replaced by an even more consistent foe : a Republican . Coming just eight weeks after Senate majority leader George Mitchell announced that he will not seek another term , Boren 's decision is the latest in a string of congressional retirements that are likely to spell trouble for Clinton in the midterm congressional elections in November . Boren is the sixth Democratic Senator to retire voluntarily this year . <P> Hours before Clinton called Boren , five of the President 's senior political advisers  --  armed with charts , maps and polling data  --  trundled into the Oval Office to illustrate the extent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election , compared with 13 in the G.O.P. , the Democrats ' 56-to-44 majority is in grave danger . With the sudden loss of proven vote getters such as Mitchell and Boren , the Democratic sure-bet states of Maine and Oklahoma are thrown into the toss-up column . As a result , political strategists can envision an outcome that could leave Democrats with nominal but not effective control of the Senate . <P> In the House , where Democrats hold a 256-to-176 edge over the G.O.P. , the outlook is better for the Administration , but not by much . History is not on the side of the Democrats . Only once in this century , when F.D.R. was in the White House , has a Democratic President managed to pick up seats in the House during a midterm election . <P> To minimize the losses , Clinton plans to hit the fund-raising trail , where an appearance by the President can generate $1 million or more in local campaign donations . Clinton will be especially active in states where Republicans have recruited strong senatorial candidates . Among them : Pennsylvania @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conduct her own tour , as will Al Gore , who is already stumping for Democrats once a week . <P> Even with a Democratic-controlled Congress , Clinton learned in the first 100 days that it takes only 41 unified Senate Republicans to slam the brakes on popular legislation . And they can usually count on a few renegade Southern Democrats to join them . The G.O.P. sank Clinton 's $16.3 billion economic- stimulus plan last year , routinely stalled or blocked high-profile nominees and delayed passage of bills like the Family and Medical Leave Act , the Brady handgun-control bill and a measure to ease voter registration . <P> Wielding the power of filibuster , Senate Republicans have on 47 occasions since 1992 forced Senate majority leader Mitchell to round up a daunting 60 votes , necessarily including a number of opposition Republicans , to shut off debate . At stake now is Clinton 's legislative agenda for the second half of his presidency . What the White House realizes , and hopes to avoid , is that such a stalemate could sour Clinton 's own re-election prospects in 1996. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
