Section : BOOKS , ARTS &; MANNERS <p> <p> Only a few know , and none will confirm . Newly welded HarperCollins bought three books from erstwhile Tory MP Jeffrey Archer for somewhere between one dollar and twenty million ; it 's a deal with the air of an out-of-court liability settlement  --  the principals agreeing not to discuss the terms of the stipulation . Talk around town  --  all of it speculative  --  is somber . Sure , HarperCollins is " well positioned , " but if it paid that tinny wordsmith twenty big ones for throe books ... well , it 's the end of civilization . ( Worse than the money for some is the fact that Mr. Archer was agentless . ) And just a few days before , Dell made a pact with another Brit , Ken ( Eye of the Needle ) Follett , paying $12.3 million for two novels . Rule Britannia ! <p> But in the Archer bargain is also the air of author-orchestrated publicity . Talk about the money began with him , when he told Publishers Weekly he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . When asked how much he subsequently got from HarperCollins , the Jos Canseco of scribbling said , " I 'm not allowed to answer that , but it certainly did n't go below " the unnamed publisher 's bid . <p> HarperCollins is mum , which usually indicates big bucks will change hands . It 's hard to figure the HarperCollins math , though . Say five hundred thousand hardcover copies plus two million paperback copies of each book sold , times $25 ( $5 for the paperback ) , times a 15 per cent royalty . Mr. Archer 's actual earnings on the various editions sold in the U.S. and Canada would , on those calculations , be just over $10 million . Not bad . Unless HarperCollins really did pay $20 million . in which case the " over-guarantee " still approaches $10 million . And I promise you the sales figures I 'm using are extremely optimistic , given that Mr. Archer , whose best-known previous novel was Kane &; Abel , has yet to achieve such numbers . And one of the new books will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except in the story-friendly genres of science fiction and horror . And although Harper Collins has the contractual right m publish " throughout the world , " there 's one big exception : the author 's own Britain . <p> But wait . I 'm not telling the whole story . For one thing , author royalties are only one of the financial realities of book publishing , and it 's possible far a book to fail to earn bask in actual royalty income the amount advanced to the author , yet still be profitable for the publisher . And there is the matter of " other sales "  --  from foreign publishing and from " performance rights , " all of which ( and this is rare in book deals ) HarperCollins controls . And let 's assume that Rupert Murdoch had his hand in the deal . His Nears Corporation owns HarperCollins , lots of newspapers , and the Fox film and broadcasting companies . Tom Wolfe once remarked that in the future the novel will be known as a " cordless mini-series , " and perhaps Mr. Murdoch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , believes Mr. Archer is perfect for the screen , and also thinks his work will travel well in translation ( or with subtitles ) in a dozen major markets around the globe . Is your calculator turned on ? Shut it off . Neither I nor anyone else outside the Murdoch orbit has the foggiest notion how to crunch numbers in such a scenario . Authors can get big options from film companies . and if you speculate that from the three books might come half a dozen screen projects , you can throw another . say , $5 million into the pot ; from the foreign publicizing another few million , but that would still leave a shortfall of a few million , so how did HarperCollins get there from here ? <p> Again , speculation about the size of the deal began with Mr. Archer . Eddie Bell , the man at HarperCollins who made the deal , delicately says of his new author , " I do n't know where he got the $20-million figure from , although he 's a great showman . " Thrift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminded me ( after refusing to discuss the details ) that unless you know how the accounting on a deal is done ( know , for instance , over how much time the author 's advance will be paid out ) , you know nothing . ( On the subject of Mr. Archer 's public comments about the money , Mr. Shinker said , " Jeffrey is teasing people . That 's the way he is . " ) <p> The first of the two novels . As the Crow Flies , will be published about a year from now . It is set , appropriately , in England , the U.S. , and Australia . A global novel for a global market . If HarperCollins/News Corporation orchestrates it all in an unprecedented way , if all the international , subsidiary , and dramatic dominoes fall neatly in sequence , Mr. Archer 's earnings could well be extraordinary . What am I saying ? They already are . <p> By Brad Miner <p>                   @ @
