Here 's everything you need to know about this versatile grain // If you still think of rice as white , bland and boring , you probably have n't checked out your supermarket 's rice section in a while . The quality and variety may just shock you . Beyond white , which is available in many types and flavors , you 'll find others in a kaleidoscope of earthy hues-amber , red , gold and blackplus an assortment of shapes and sizes . Grown on almost every continent , rice is the staff of life for more than half the world 's population , yet for some reason , it has never been an integral part of the American meal . Our consumption is increasing , however , especially as we embrace international cuisines like Thai , Japanese and Latin , which feature the grain . Adding rice to our national diet not only reaps flavor benefits , but nutritional ones as well . As the rest of the world has known for centuries , rice , in all its variations , is deliciously versatile and can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whole-grain rice does n't contain a significant amount of protein , but its amino acid profile is excellent and the protein it does have is high-quality and readily accessible to the body . This rice is also rich in fiber and B vitamins and contains substantial amounts of vitamin E , phosphorus , potassium and iron . Refined or not , all rice is low in sodium and fat and gluten-free , making it easily digestible and a good option for anyone allergic to wheat . There are thousands of varieties of rice grown worldwide , yet only a few different kinds are sold commercially . To set the record straight , all rice starts out brown . The grain is harvested in its hull , a tough , inedible covering ; removing it reveals whole brown kernels . Refinement is the process by which the kernels are stripped of their husk , bran and germ to achieve a pristine and polished whiteness-leaving only the endosperm and very little else in the way of nutrition . Refined rice is sometimes enriched after the fact with vitamins and minerals , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original grain , so enriched rice is lower in protein , vitamin E , magnesium , potassium and phosphorous . Parboiled or converted rice , developed centuries ago in Asia , fares a bit better health-wise . Before hulling , the grains are steamed under pressure , which forces vitamins and minerals near the outside of the kernels into the center , saving much of the nutritional value . Regardless of color , all rice is classified into one of three categories determined by its length relative to width , and its texture after cooking . Long-grain rice is three to five times longer than it is wide . A starch called amylose keeps the cooked grains from clinging together and creates the characteristic fluffy texture . Because of this quality , long-grain varieties are ideal for pilafs , stir-fries and salads . Short-grain rice contains a high proportion of amylopectin starch , which gives the stubby , round kernels a sticky consistency . Medium-grain rice , about twice as long as it is wide , has a fairly equal share of amylose and amylopectin . The grains , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Medium- and short-grain varieties are perfect for loaves , patties , vegetable stuffings and puddings . STORAGE AND PREPARATION When shopping for rice , buy from a store with a high volume that is more likely to have a rapid turnover and opt for organic ( cultivated without pesticides or chemicals ) whenever possible . Store raw rice in its unopened package in a cool , dry place . Once opened , transfer rice to an airtight container . The natural oils in unrefined varieties make them more susceptible to spoilage than white rice . Brown rice keeps two to three months at room temperature ; refrigerate or freeze it for longer storage . There is no reason to rinse domestically grown rice ( check packaging to find out ) , unless a recipe specifies to do so . Imported varieties or rice bought from bulk bins , however , benefit from rinsing to remove dust and grit . Rinse rice under cool running water until the water runs clear or soak it in a bowl with enough water to cover , stirring the rice and changing the water until it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colander . ( Never rinse enriched white rice , or you 'll wash off the added nutrients , which are applied in solution . ) MAKING PERFECT RICE Bad experiences with lumpy , gluey rice may have turned you off to anything but instant rice that you boil in a bag . But the following tips will take the guesswork out of cooking rice . The best cooking technique is a matter of opinion , and there are as many favored methods as there are varieties of the grain . Simmering or " steaming " is probably the most common . Combine rice with about twice as much water and a pinch of salt in a saucepan , bring to a boil , cover tightly and turn the heat as low as possible . Simmer white rice for 15 minutes , brown for 40 . Remove the pan from the heat and let it stand , still covered , for at least 10 minutes . The liquid should be completely absorbed and the grains tender . Soaking rice for several hours beforehand will reduce the cooking time . Toasting rice in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enhance its naturally nutty flavor . You can also boil rice in a large volume of water ( as you would pasta ) and drain it in a colander or steam it over boiling water until tender . If you already have a moderate ( 350degF. ) oven on , try baking your rice : Combine 2 cups of boiling water , 1 cup of rice and a pinch of salt in an ovenproof pan and cover tightly . Bake about 1 hour for brown rice ; 25 to 35 minutes for refined . Pressure-cooking ( recommended for short- and medium-grain varieties ) is another possibility . The general rule of thumb is 1% cups of water for each cup of rice , and 45 minutes of cooking . If you eat a lot of rice , automatic rice cookers are a good alternative . Resembling slow cookers , they fit inside a container with an electric heating element on the bottom . All you do is put the specified amounts of rice and water ( they often call for less water ) into the machine , cover and turn it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stays at a constant temperature until all the water is absorbed , then it shuts off or switches to a very low setting to keep the rice warm . Be sure to follow the instructions for your particular cooker . A glossary of rice varieties follows . In addition to these , you may come across packaged blends of two or more types .
