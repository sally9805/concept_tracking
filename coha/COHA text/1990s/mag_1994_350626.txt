In the jungle called Hollywood , there are two tribes . One is the brown-eyed honey drippers , the other the blue-eyed truth tellers . The honey drippers address their valet parkers as darling , glad-hand everyone who brunches at Patrick 's , and make movies they hope the whole world will pay to see . The truth tellers take risks and make trouble . They sign up for roles in eccentric movies and turn down parts in surefire hits . They go their own way , never fretting if others do n't follow . <P> In Hollywood the honey drippers are legion . As for the blue-eyed truth tellers  --  those strange , spiky creatures who might be avoided and ought to be cherished  --  they could all be called Debra Winger . <P> Truth teller is perhaps the kindest name that the industry would think to call the actress , whose strong will has often butted against Hollywood 's tender backside . She was outspoken in her early plush years , when potent turns in Urban Cowboy , An Officer and a Gentleman and Terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivering  --  young actress . She wore her wild streak in public : sex , drugs , locking horns with directors and co-stars . She turned down meaty roles in several popular films ( including Broadcast News ) and walked off another ( A League of Their Own ) . Her star waned with brash parts in The Sheltering Sky and Everybody Wins . She made amber waves in Nebraska while trysting with Governor Bob Kerrey , before and after her two- year marriage to actor Timothy Hutton . <P> Winger is unlikely to change , now that she is a full-time mother with a revived career  --  earning critical kudos for her role as poet Joy Gresham in Shadowlands and a Golden Globe nomination for the aptly named A Dangerous Woman . " I really do n't care , " Winger sighs , in her champagne-and-cigarettes voice , when the subject of her reputation is broached . " I 'd rather have the freedom to say what I want . Sometimes I wish I were more graceful , but , hey , I 'm not  --  though I 'm working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in people who are deemed difficult . Usually difficulty is just another word for friction , and friction creates heat . I think friction is a good thing . " <P> Fortunately , Richard Attenborough came to the same conclusion . In casting Shadowlands , the director was looking for " an actress who in her own personality had some of the feisty , slightly abrasive elements of Joy Gresham . I knew of Debra 's ' difficult ' reputation  --  of being quite a girl , as we say at home . So I said , ' I do n't mind if you slap me around the head  --  if at the end of the day what appears on the screen is what we all want . ' And of course what happened was that she absolutely came up with the goods . " <P> She had never lost them . At 38 , Winger is no longer Hollywood 's prime smart cutie . But this dangerous woman is still a beautiful one , with the searchlight intelligence radiating from her blue eyes and the seeming spontaneity , even surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her pretty gifts have matured . She mixes the old guts and softness more daringly now , and the lock she has on her characters is stronger than The Club .
