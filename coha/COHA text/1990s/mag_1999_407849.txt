When firming your rear , less is more . // When it comes to training your lower body . it 's tempting to stick with time-efficient multimuscle exercises - like leg presses , lunges and squats - to work your quads , glutes and hamstrings . But for a really good boost ( to your butt . especially ) you need to add in a few super-targeted moves done with resistance to effectively train the muscle group . The key to efficiency is to perform these exercises with the right amount of weight and proper form . says Janis Saffell , owner of Fitness Express International , a fitness-consulting company based in Miami . It 's important to take extra time to isolate and train the glutes because , for most of us , they are n't challenged enough during everyday activity . When training this area , people often use improper form , which leads to the quads. abs or lower back doing most of the work , leaving nothing for the glutes and hamstrings , she says . To prevent this , Saffell has designed three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but each has a slightly different focus . Both the standing leg extension and prone hip extension are done with legs straight and focus more on the buttocks and upper fibers of the hamstrings . The incline hamstring curl targets the hamstrings more while the buttocks isometrically contract and help to stabilize the pelvis against the bench . When you do these exercises , do n't rush the movement . " If you do it too fast , you 're using momentum , not your muscles , " Saffell says . She suggests you work through the full range of motion and do as many reps as you can without sacrificing form and alignment . If you can finish your reps without challenging your muscles , add more weight . 1 . STANDING HIP EXTENSION Set an incline bench at a 45-degree angle .

The order in which you do the exercises in this workout is n't crucial . " If you 're also doing quadriceps , you can do either one first ; just make sure to do a good warmup , " she says . Stair climbing and bike riding are ideal : They warm up the entire lower body for the isolation work to come . " And stretch when you 're done working out , especially the hamstrings , " she says .
