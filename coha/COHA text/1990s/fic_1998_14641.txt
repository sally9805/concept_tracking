Scene Tooth of Asmodeus : At one of the GIRLS ' parents ' summer place . The last party of summer , just before Labor Day . People are having a good time .

The one juggling stops , does cartwheels ; the one doing cartwheels stops , starts to dance the Hokey Locus ; the one doing the Hokey Locus stops , begins to juggle the bright red balls . and so on . They freeze . Pause . Slightly off-key , they sing . ) O , Pity is not enough.The executioner awaitshis rope of gold . O , Pity is not enough .

Blue Streak 's the nearest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diner on Route Six , the Lazy Eyeball . HOPE Still I like it , though the air smells smells , like , not quite right . BUGGINS Not quite right ? HOPE As if , it were you know , like BUGGINS ? HOPE Too something . Too full of prismatical gases . Strange . BUGGINS ? HOPE Siccative , I mean . Like the Siberian wallflower . ( The other laughs . ) BUGGINS Supergobosnoptious , sirrah ! ( They trade high fives , laugh . ) A bunch of the GIRLS bend over to look at something on the ground . Something fascinating . One gingerly touches it with the toe of her shoe . One pokes at it with a crooked stick . They talk it over with each other , randomly . ) What is it ? Is it alive ? Look at the tail ! Look at the gimlet eyes ! Is it the rat 's tail ? Ha , ha , ha ! ( Repeat x 3. ) p. 4 DINAH Why do they just stand there , glowering ? FORREST My word , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unbelievable malice . DINAH Off the pie chart . That 's because Hope 's a darling , does n't complain about violin lessons , and can do cube roots in her head .

FORREST Go and dandle Hope , Buggins . She 'll cheer you up . BUGGINS Drat . ( She goes over to sweet , buttery smooth HOPE , in her pillar of light . CHAZ BOIARDO GUTHRIE enters , the sole boy present , and an old amour of LISSA . He wears black and does the Random Cakewalk , coolest of the cool. ) p. 5 LISA Behold the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silences both with a wave of her arm . Pause . They lift her veil , revealing her radiant whiteness . She smiles . ) LISA The reptile* contains his others , his eithers and epithets . His neithers and no ones . ELYSSA The reptile's* mighty roar cracks open the fabric of the heavens . LISA The reptile answers to the name " Reptile " because although his given name is Chaz Boiardo Guthrie , his true name* is Reptile . BOTH Reptile of the tribe of Reptile . ELYSSA Reptile* of the clan of Reptile . ( High fives all around . As CHAZ proceeds , a shadow falls behind him like a cape . His trapezoidal obscuration . The GIRLS freeze , one by one as they are touched by his shadow 's lady slipper . It is a cape . Then , one by one , and after each is touched , they go out simply and slowly . ) CHAZ BOIARDO GUTHRIE ( Very quietly ) Lissa , Lissa . Listen , Lissa . You have to listen to me . Really , I mean it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why . The wonder is all around us and is , is deep within us and deep within our boxes.The wonder wonders at our whys and wherefores . The wonder has no patience for these questions , paltry matters of dubiousness . For not only is the wonder a thing that fills all boxes , and all possible hats ; the wonder is itself a box that can not be filled . Ever , not ever.Lissa , Lissa . Listen , Lissa . You have to listen to me , because I love you more than anything you know . I love you more than my family , my nation or my god . Compared with you my god is a boring botch . An idol . A graven image . A fraud . Yes.If I knew how to do it , I would frame the ultimate question on your behalf , Lissa , Because you are the answer to that question . Just as you are what the true wonder most wonders at , deep within wonder 's hidden place , here , in Domely Park and there , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flatland off the Inkjet River where you study topology , River and Rivets , the meaning of Exodus 3:16 , transubstantiation , Ferrier-Golfe Systems , Vitruvian scrolls , tree and branch platters , and wickiups under the careful guidance of Madame Tomba and the Headmistress whose name ( But he is stopped by a raspberry from LISA , the last of the GIRLS to retire . Only now do we see , along with CHAZ , that HOPE has spontaneously combusted . All that remains of her is a small pile of char , and her smoking shoes. ) where did they all go ? Where did they go ? Where ? ( Pause . ) Lissa ? Lisa ? Elyssa ? ( Bends over to pick up one smoldering shoe. ) @x Scene The Cloven Hoof : The GIRLS in the schoolyard at Saint Lulu 's , smoking and thinking . All are intensely busy with the arcane game of introspection and the inner life . A TEACHER appears . MADAME TOMBA Three minutes , girls . ( Pause . ) FAY I saw what you did to Hope. * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , low . LISA Do n't look at me. * ( Pointing to ELYSSA . ) She did it . ELYSSA She did it . Do n't give me the stink-eye . ( They glare at each other . Pause . All turn to LISSA who smiles wickedly ; yes , she did it . ) DORRIT I think that boy Chaz is cute . ( All look at her. ) in a plebian sort of way . LISA I think he was actually a rabbit . ELYSSA I think he was actually a skunk . ( Pause . Thoughtful consideration . ) LISSA I think he has crossed over into the land beyond television . p. 8 BUGGINS That 's impossible ! LISA ? FAY But , but there is no place beyond television . ( All stare at clueless FAY . ) ELYSSA Skunk . LISA Rabbit . ELYSSA Skrunk . LISA Skrabbit . ELYSSA Skrunkabbit . LISA ( Horribly hissed and trilled . ) Skrrrbt . LISSA When I go away , I shall go terribly terribly far away . So far I shall leave no trace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes that far . That far is beyond heaven and and LISSA The Bad Place ? Ha . BUGGINS No . A place beyond that . FAY There is no place beyond that . LISSA Yes there is . ( All become solemn and thoughtful . Pause . It becomes completely still for a time . TEACHER reappears . ) MADAME TOMBA You have one minute , girls . ( She goes . The GIRLS move about ever so slightly , as they regroup . Finish their cigarettes , and look up at the sky . In unison , they stub the butts . ) In precisely one minute , blackout @x Scene The Rat 's Tail : The GIRLS in class . They listen as MADAME TOMBA lectures to them on certain important topics from history . MADAME TOMBA The lesson for today is a momentous one , for it concerns the whys and wherefores of Going Away . And the question of how these questions implicate us us all ( But the GIRLS are shuffling their feet . Pause . They cease their shuffling under the hard gaze of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue of templetation , disobedience , and crime.Not to mention the fate of those brave , but foolish , women who have gone , so to speak , away . Gone away , and in so doing , gone astray . ( Leaning forward . ) Are we clear on that ? Are we very clear ? I want to make very sure we are very clear as to the nature of the topic under discussion . Good . DORRIT I thought we were supposed to prepare on Pandora . MADAME TOMBA Yes , Dorrit , that is correct . FAY And Hypatia of Alexandria and the Empress Irene . MADAME TOMBA That is correct , Fay . You have evidently gotten it right . Now before we tackle the topic of these persenalities directly , perhaps we ought to to address the question of a general theory of going away . Now , has anyone prepared ah upon the subject of these three women in the context of leave taking ? ( Pause . Everyone looks at ELYSSA. ) p. 11 ELYSSA ( Calmly and quietly . ) The way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men and women of today as a kind of going away . And it does so on a much grander scale than most of us imagine . For it is possible to live in a period without being of it . What I mean is that the modern mind is exceptional even in the modern age.For instance , to how many of us are the conceptions on which the life of our time is based  --  evidence , sequence , causality  --  strange and unintelligible . These people , those who have gone away , without actually leaving , live fragmentary and , as it were , piecemeal existences , in a directly connected world . A world of cause and connection . MADAME TOMBA Come to the point , Elyssa . ELYSSA In her time , Hypatia proved the riddle of living connectedly in an unconnected , and therefore fragmentary , world . ( Pause . ) MADAME TOMBA Elyssa , that will be all . Fay , what do you have to report on the topic ? FAY Hypatia , daughter of the Alexandrian philosopher and mathematician Theon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so extraordinarily beautiful she was forced to give her public lectures concealed behind a screen . ( General tittering. ) p. 12 MADAME TOMBA Please , Fay , go on . FAY ( Deeply embarrassed ) I can not go on . MADAME TOMBA What about you , Lissa ? LISSA Neither can I. MADAME TOMBA You can not ? Why not ? ( A cold and disobedient pause . ) LISSA Just that I can not . I have to get out of here . ( She gets up and goes . An awkward pause . ) MADAME TOMBA Lisa . Could you finish for her ? LISA I prepared Pandora and Irene , not Hypatia . BUGGINS I prepared Hypatia and Pandora and Irene . MADAME TOMBA Very good , Buggins , but I did not ask you , did I ? BUGGINS No not exactly but I thought MADAME TOMBA Saint Absentia Profunda , the guardian of this institution , does not care a fig what you think , Buggins . What our saint desires of you is perfect obedience , is that clear ? BUGGINS Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could cover Irene . p. 13 DORRIT I know Irene deserved to be a saint even though she deposed and caused to be blinded her own son , Constantine the Sixth , grandson of Constantine " Whose Name Is Shit . " In this way  --  MADAME TOMBA Very good , Dorrit . Lisa , could you perhaps explain why Irene deserves to be a saint even in despite of her ferocious crimes . LISA By her act she put an end to the Iconoclast Controversy , MADAME TOMBA And ? LISA By her act she restored to power those who would venerate and preserve the icons . MADAME TOMBA And ? LISA The worship of icons is part of the rat 's tail that must be preserved . MADAME TOMBA I beg your pardon . ( Pause . A chilly one . ) LISA You have my pardon . MADAME TOMBA And what is this " rat 's tail " you are referring to ? ELYSSA The worship of icons is part of the problem I mentioned before . It is a medieval thing , and in so far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitutes an exemplary instance of the sham of living a life within an age without being part of that age . p. 14 LISA It constitutes one of the seven bad things . ( Pause . ) MADAME TOMBA One of the seven bad things . Specifically , what seven bad things are you referring to ? LISA The seven bad things are the left over contents of Pandora 's box . MADAME TOMBA In what sense are they left over ? LISA After all the known and knowable evils have escaped , have flapped and flittered away . MADAME TOMBA These yet remain ? LISA That is the hypothesis , Celia . ( An icy pause . ) MADAME TOMBA Whose hypothesis ? ELYSSA AND LISA Ours . MADAME TOMBA I see . And who is " we " ? ELYSSA AND LISA Us . ( Things are scary . ) BUGGINS Hey ! * What 's going on ? FAY I know what happened to Hypatia . The mob of Peter the Reader accosted her , alone , on the street . They tore off her garments , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torn limb from limb , and what was left was burned , burned like trash . All this was at the order of Cyril , who was the archbishop of Alexandria . But he was really smart , and no one ever punished him . That was Hypatia 's going away . p. 15 MADAME TOMBA And so , Fay , what is it to go away ? ELYSSA ( Quietly . ) To go away is to experience , or cause to suffer , a break in the continuum . MADAME TOMBA What continuum are you referring to ? ( Pause . Turning violently to LISA . ) You are never , ever to refer to me as " Celia " again . LISA ( Under her breath . ) Okay . Okay . FAY I do n't understand why everyone is , like , talking this way . Talking this way is , like , really confusing . MADAME TOMBA ( Coming apart ) Then perhaps someone should plug your ears , Fay . Does someone possess a piece of chewing gum or sticky wax to seal Fay 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 'd be hard to waste a stick on a silly drip like Fay . ( General tittering . Pause . The GIRLS notice MADAME TOMBA is quietly weeping . ) MADAME TOMBA I do n't know . I do n't know . ( Pause . ) I just do n't recognize myself . And I just feel so god damn well superfluous . I just ca n't seem to get around the fact . ( But LISSA returns in a strange slither . She is wearing slippers of a brilliant scarlet . ) Bump to black. @x Scene Desiccated Chicken Wing : Outside , on another recess . All the GIRLS , smoking and thinking . BUGGINS I do n't get it . I was prepared to cover Irene . I was prepared to cover Hypatia . I was prepared to cover Pandora . No one asks me a blessed thing . I do n't get it . ( Pause . ) LISA No one asked you , Buggins , because you are always prepared to cover anyone and anything and that is a fact known to everyone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LISA does something with her fingers . All the rest follow her motions with evident interest . She makes a spider . She makes another bug . The spider goes on the hunt . The other bug , being stupid , suspects nothing The spider considers how best to achieve her aim . The spider thinks deeply , deeply and mathematically . The stupid bug continues happily being a stupid bug , unaware of danger . LISSA begins doing the spider web with her feet . All the other GIRLS attempt to follow LISSA 'S lead . LISSA 'S hands do the spider and the stupid bug ; but her feet do the web . All the others follow the best they can , some better than others . The poor bug is trapped . Only now horribly aware of its fate : it will be eaten. ) p. 17 LISSA It will be eaten . ALL It will be torn limb from limb , and eaten . ELYSSA The horrible stupid bug will be torn apart and eaten . ( All stop in astonishment . She sings , alone and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground is gray ; and I say : hey , okay ! and I say : hey , it is okay.Because night is not a toilet.Joy is not a day.Dance , dance or be beatenby wild oats or by what 's wheaten . ALL Oaf , loaf ; oaf , loaf ; for up in thesky ELYSSA is the Desiccated Chicken Wing , whose song has gone away , whose song has gone away . ALL Oaf , loaf ; oaf , loaf ; oaf , loaf . ELYSSA Oh , yes ; oh , yes . The chicken'swing is terribly , terribly driedbecause the silly thing has died . ELYSSA and gone away to the strangest place , swank Vadoo , where , you know who , Chaz Boiardo Guthrie , slithers p. 18 ALL slither , slither , *slither ELYSSA AND LISSA slithers , and does the Happy Snake . ( Pause . All do the Happy Snake . All do a strange thing with only fingers and toes ; nobody knows what it is . Everything stops . Silence . ) ELYSSA Nothing new shall be put into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with hatred. ) @x Scene The Fork Malicious : Within the office of THE HEAD-MISTRESS . Extraordinary shadows , as if from beyond the grave . She is dressing down MADAME TOMBA . ) THE HEADMISTRESS Your actions have jeopardized everything we work for . MADAME TOMBA I know it . I know it . I do n't know what to do . The girls apparently have concocted a dream world they call " Vadu , " from whence they draw terrific energy . I know it is a delusion but the energy they now command is terrible , terrible . I fear they had something to do with poor Hope 's disappearance . THE HEADMISTRESS And Lisa is the ringleader ? MADAME TOMBA Not at all clear . She appears to be , but they are all so intensely evilish it is difficult on these occasions even to tell them apart . THE HEADMISTRESS Somewhere , Celia , we 've lost the idea of childhood . MADAME TOMBA That is precisely what I keep thinking , only . Perhaps their malice has some root cause in a dynamic or something-elseian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HEADMISTRESS That would amount to a violation of the Hardy-Weinberg principle ; not to mention a rare and rabbity instance of the ablative heresy of the defrocked one you know who Do we dare pronounce the name ? No . Those who have gone away are the Gone Away in every respect . No part of them lingers in the box , as it were . p. 20 MADAME TOMBA That reminds me . Odd you should mention it . And they talk of Pandora in a way I found ( or find , rather ) distinctly disturbing . They talk about what was left . THE HEADMISTRESS How do you mean ? MADAME TOMBA They talk about what was left in Pandora 's box , after the more commonplace evils had made their escape . THE HEADMISTRESS How did you learn this , Celia ? MADAME TOMBA Because I have overheard them when they did not suspect I was present . THE HEADMISTRESS Like Absentia Profunda ? MADAME TOMBA Precisely . And their other models are Hypatia , who was murdered for her crimes by a Christian mob under instructions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hypotenuse . THE HEADMISTRESS Yes , yes . That 's a popular conjecture . Among certain sets . MADAME TOMBA And the ninth-century Byzantine empress , Irene , who deposed her own son Constantine , and caused him to be made to go away , to go away in order to thwart the Iconoclasts . THE HEADMISTRESS A fine role model for a contemporary young woman , if you ask me . Though church history has never been exactly my long suit . Nothing wrong with that , in my view . p. 21 MADAME TOMBA No , no . They have twisted the meaning of these events . They have twisted them horribly so that their interpretation suggests a social and philosophical meaning that is that is monstrous and bold . One , furthermore , that defies all convention . THE HEADMISTRESS I 've heard enough . MADAME TOMBA Ask Dorrit . Ask Fay . Ask Buggins , for Pete 's sake . THE HEADMISTRESS Please . Stop whining . MADAME TOMBA Ask anyone . This is criminal . You must punish them . You must . THE HEADMISTRESS But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TOMBA What about Hope ? THE HEADMISTRESS What about her ? What is the insinuation ? MADAME TOMBA She was murdered . THE HEADMISTRESS A disappearance . Case closed . ( Pause . ) What nonsense . MADAME TOMBA She burnt up . In a flash . All that remained of her were her poor , little shoes , smoking . And the horrible reek . THE HEADMISTRESS Spontaneous combustion is not a suitable hypothesis in this connection , Celia. p. 22 MADAME TOMBA You are killing the messenger then ? THE HEADMISTRESS And what precisely is the message ? Call it whatever you like . You may go . ( MADAME TOMBA buries her face in her hands , in total despair . ) First , I would like to speak . Successively , with the three girls you mentioned . In proper succession . Then we will decide on a course of action.Oh , Celia , dear . Please stop crying . I was only trying to scare you , to drive a little sense into that pretty head . My foolish little puppy . Bridge scene : A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arranged artistically , and dressed beautifully .

( All go , but LISSA . ) THE HEADMISTRESS Hello , Lissa . LISSA Hello , Madam Headmistress . THE HEADMISTRESS How are you , Lissa . LISSA Doing very nicely , thank you . THE HEADMISTRESS So tell me. p. 23 LISSA Tell you what ? THE HEADMISTRESS You know . LISSA Not really . THE HEADMISTRESS Do you want to be made to go away ? LISSA Had n't really thought much about it . THE HEADMISTRESS Well you 'd better . LISSA Why ? THE HEADMISTRESS Because unless we can straighten a few things out that 's where you 'll be going , young lady . LISSA " that 's where you 'll be going , young lady . " ( Pause . THE HEADMISTRESS Cracks her knuckles ; LISSA cracks her knuckles alse ; smiles at THE HEADMISTRESS . ) THE HEADMISTRESS You know we had a name for girls like you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was " wiseacre . " LISSA We have a name for you : The Fork Malicious . ( Pause . ) The Fork Malicious . THE HEADMISTRESS Do you have any idea how just how really rude , tactless , and inconsiderate you are ? LISSA Tomba has fallen . Who , or what , is next ? p. 24 THE HEADMISTRESS Do you want to be made to go away ? LISSA I do n't give a rat 's tail , really . If you want to know the truth . THE HEADMISTRESS Who is Vadoo ? ( Wild laughter from LISSA . ) LISSA It 's next door , and you do n't even see it . ( Blackout . When lights come back up , LISA is seated where LISSA had been . On the floor , the latter 's smoking shoes . ) THE HEADMISTRESS Lisa , what are you three up to ? LISA Up to up to up to going going gone . THE HEADMISTRESS We have removed Madame Tomba . She shall be replaced by the much sterner Madame Circumflex , an expert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LISA You are The Fork Malicious and there is nothing obscurer . Because  --  THE HEADMISTRESS What are you saying ? What is this nonsense ? ELYSSA AND LISSA ( Off . ) Because whatever you do will be done over again deep in the darkness at Vadu . And be made right , quite right , deep in the darkness at Vadoo. p. 25 THE HEADMISTRESS Do n't mock me . The authority I represent and embody is a legitimate authority . LISA You have no idea what danger you 're in . THE HEADMISTRESS Is that a threat ? LISA The truth is the truth , whether or not it contains a threat . ( Pause . ) THE HEADMISTRESS Hope is a good girl . We are worried about her . What have you done with her ? Chaz is a good boy . His family says he now suffers from an unaccountable delirium . They say he is subject to rapid fits of torsion and gyration . Have you done this ? How have you done this ? ( Pause . ) LISA Headmistress , madam , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you went away for a while . Yes , if you went away for quite a spell . THE HEADMISTRESS Lisa , you are being perverse . LISA I am not being perverse ; I am being the reverse of perverse ; only my terseness is such that it turn off the top of your tap . Drip , drip , drip , oh ( Pause . All three EVIL SISTERS are heard . They sing . ) Far away in the state of Palominolies , like a carpet , velvet Vadoo.All things that grin , they grin thereas they turn their back on you , Headmistress , and folks like you.You will never ever understand Vadu. p. 26 LISA You will never go awaywithout returning where you stand , forever ampersand . In between , in between , faith and doubt , ALL In between faith and doubt , In between life and death , In between in and out.In between , In between , In between , Vadoo you will never understand .

( Wild laughter from LISA . She Goes Away , poof ! Pause . ELYSSA appears where LISA had been . ELYSSA mouths the words spoken offstage by her Evil Sisters . ) LISSA AND LISA Vadoo is very near , but you are so blockheaded , so counterfactually impaired you shall never , never , never , never perceive it . THE HEADMISTRESS What do you mean by " it " ? ALL THREE Skip it . THE HEADMISTRESS What do you mean by " skip it " ? ELYSSA Skip that too . p. 27 THE HEADMISTRESS Are you talking about a call , a summons ? An erasure ? An extinction ? ELYSSA Vadoo . A much better place . Perhaps a little chilly , though , on those frosty winter nights . Velvety Vadoo . THE HEADMISTRESS I am worried , Elyssa , about you . ELYSSA No , my dear Headmistress , I am worried about you . The Q in you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solid granite . She speaks slowly , quietly , as if to a foreigner , or to a person of limited intelligence . ) THE HEADMISTRESS Do you know , Elyssa , what suffering and agony there are in the world ? Do you know what awful shocks and blows there are in life ? Can you imagine the lies and deceit which undergird all human vainglory and wishful thinking ? Can you picture the torments of those less fortunate than you ? Do n't you have anything to say to those wise and mighty ones who have prepared a place of presence for you , here at this school in the golden lady slipper of Palomino County ? ELYSSA No . Not really . THE HEADMISTRESS And why , pray tell , why not ? ELYSSA Because all that does not matter once we have gone away . p. 28 THE HEADMISTRESS And where do you imagine going away from ? ELYSSA From the here and now .

Because you must come with me . You must come with me quickly , before we are discovered . BUGGINS What are you TALKING ABOUT ? Vadu is a place we made up . Lissa and Elyssa and Lisa , and me . THE VADEMECUM OF VADOO No , no , no . Vadoo is really . Just past the town of Blue Streak , over the viaduct and past the diner on Route Six , The Lazy Eyeball . Vadoo extends past the Old and Lost Rivers of Tenebrae , only only some people do not see the place . Some people are foolish and think if they do not see a place it is not there . ( BUGGINS turns out to us as she wonders at this . ) No , no , no . Some people do not honor the first things . Such as the first woman to run a marathon in less than two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York in 1979 ; the first fire department to be composed entirely of women ( Asheville , New York ) in 1943 ; the first planetarium , or Orrerry , imported to this country in 1732 ; the first orphanage established in New York in 1654 ; the first child born of European parents in the New World , called Snorro , in the year 1007 . Because people who do not honor the first things are incapable of perceiving what is there when it is here . And so , I tell you : ( Pause . ) I am called The Black Tulip and I am the Vademecum of Vadu . I am the Vademecum of Vadoo , and I am one of the seven angels who enter and serve before the Glory of the Lord . ( Stunned , she bows before him . ) Come . Come with me . You must come quickly . p. 34 BUGGINS But I ca n't just run off . THE VADEMECUM OF VADOO In Vadoo , you will find your friends . Here there is nothing for you . Desperate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clueless sister who steals your lipstick , ( This is news to BUGGINS. ) the idiocy of higher education looming . In Vadu we have a very fine time . ( Vadoovian music and dancing girls appear . Screens , incense , and a strange but seductive music . They do the Jamaican Car Service . They do the Flea Circus . They do the Hokey Locus . ) We have a fine old time indeed . Not like here . BUGGINS I do n't know what to say . THE VADEMECUM OF VADOO And there is work to be done . Like your friends , both Madame Tomba , the one who has fallen , and the Headmistress have been dematerialized and electronically reassembled beyond the mystic borders of Vadoo . We need your help . We need it desperately . And then there is the question of Hope . BUGGINS Hope ? What do you mean ? THE VADEMECUM OF VADOO Your wicked nemesis , Hope Fleming , who you thought had been destroyed ; yes , Hope , Hope has been reborn in Vadoo ; bright , beaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golden beneficence. p. 35 BUGGINS Hope ! Why that tricky little bitch . THE VADEMECUM OF VADOO You must help us destroy her . BUGGINS Okay . I 'm going . ( She gets up and follows his flickering phantom as it drifts off into the woods like smoke . Night noises resume and ELYSSA snaps out of it . Surprised , she looks about . Pause . ) ELYSSA Buggins , Buggins . ( But she is gone . We see a figure approach . It is ELYSSA 's MOTHER . ) ELYSSA Rats . ELYSSA 'S MOTHER So what are you two doing out here , It 's getting chilly . Where 's Buggins ? ELYSSA She was just here . Maybe she went back to the house . Is Cosby on yet ? ELYSSA 'S MOTHER Have you finished your homework ? ELYSSA No , Mom . Guess I 'm still a little upset . ELYSSA 'S MOTHER By the nasty incident at school ? ( She nods . ) Well I would n't worry about it . ( Pause . ) There 's bound to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I would n't talk about it to too many people . At least until you have your session with the school 's crisis counselors. p. 36 ELYSSA Was n't planning on it . ( Pause . ) ELYSSA 'S MOTHER What a beautiful night . I 'm going back . Do n't stay out here too late , Elyssa . Ten thirty 's your bed time . ELYSSA Yes , ma'am . ( ELYSSA 's MOTHER gets up to go . Looks down . ) ELYSSA 'S MOTHER What 's this ? ( It is THE VADEMECUM 's bizarre hat . ) ELYSSA Beats me . ELYSSA 'S MOTHER Did you make this ? ELYSSA Mother , please . ELYSSA 'S MOTHER Well , do you want this ? ( Looking it over . ) Looks like it 's from the school play . ELYSSA Mother , please , I have no idea . People from as far as the Parable River over in Fairfax , from nearly as far as East Continuum come here to wander in solitude , enjoying Mother Nature . Probably some tinkers left it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ELYSSA I do n't know . ( A strange pause . ) ELYSSA 'S MOTHER Guess I 'll go scare up Buggins. p. 37 ELYSSA Probably back at the house . Spoiled little brat . ELYSSA 'S MOTHER Hate the sin , not the sinner . ELYSSA The sinner is the sin . ELYSSA 'S MOTHER That 's a rather dark thought , young lady . ELYSSA She went back to the house . Probabilistically . ELYSSA 'S MOTHER Well , okay . We 'll see . Do n't stay out here too long , you hear ? ELYSSA Okay , okay . ELYSSA 'S MOTHER Kids these days . ( She strolls back towards the house . Pause . ELYSSA is alone . She sings . ) ELYSSA I am a random pant leglooking for the moon . Alas , alas , there is no roomin my mighty pant legfor the bride and groom.Pant leg , bird 's egg , Scanderbeg.Three legs , four legs , eight legs , nine . ( We hear a twig snap . ) Hey , who 's there ? Buggins , is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ELYSSA is scared . ) SHAPE What are you ? I know you are a god , but what god I do not know . p. 38 ELYSSA  --  SHAPE Tell me what god and what you are doing in these woods . Great Pan is dead . Great Pan is dead , whose woods these are . Tell me , ELYSSA I I ( She stutters . Tries to become very small . The shape alters its position . Pause . ) SHAPE Who I am , you ask and since you ask I will tell you . ELYSSA Please go away , and leave me alone . SHAPE Listen to me before you judge . Please listen . That 's all I ask . ( Pause . ) ELYSSA Okay . But SHAPE I am the President of the United States and I am very , very ill . ( Suspicious , ELYSSA whirls about , the SHAPE 's upper torso and face are hidden in the shadows . ) ELYSSA Hey , what is this ? SHAPE I said : I am the President of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sings : ) Willow , willow , willow , brillo , Oh ( Clears his throat . She sees it 's CHAZ. ) p. 39 ELYSSA Chaz . CHAZ BOIARDO GUTHRIE How 'd you guess ? ELYSSA Real difficult . CHAZ BOIARDO GUTHRIE Hey , where 's Buggins ? ELYSSA Do n't know . We were sitting here talking and she , like , was n't here anymore . I think I dozed off and she wandered off back to the house . You should n't scare people like that . CHAZ BOIARDO GUTHRIE I just wanted to wish you two a good night . ELYSSA  --   --  CHAZ BOIARDO GUTHRIE I heard something strange happened at your school today . ELYSSA I do n't really want to talk about it , Chaz . ( Pause . ) Please , go . Just go . ( Pause . ) CHAZ BOIARDO GUTHRIE Okay , I 'll go . ( Pause . Takes his time . ) I 'm almost gone . Going , going Good night , Lisa. * Good night . ELYSSA Go , please . ( Poof . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure . When she is certain he has removed himself from her presence she returns to where she was , looking out at us in the peace of the night . She looks at the moon . ) I know my evil sisters will be with me always and forever . Along with the contents of Pandora box : The Tooth of Asmodeus , The Cloven Hoof , The Rat 's Tail , The Desiccated Chicken Wing , The Fork Malicious , and the Black Tulip . ( Her EVIL SISTERS appear as she speaks , each with a Japanese lantern . They kneel on either side and all sing a final song . Behind them the others reappear and do the Mighty Turtle . They do the Hungry Vacuum Cleaner . The GIRLS sing. ) p. 40 EVIL SISTERS Oh , my beloved executioner , I have for you the golden rope.I have found it , I have found it , coiled neatly ELYSSA coiled neatly beneath the Ding-Dongtree , LISSA where that dope , ALL ( Speaking ) Chaz Boiardo Guthrie ELYSSA had hidden it , near the , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my song ALL All this could happen , only in Vadoo , only in Vadu . ( Softly , as lights dim . ) All this could happen ; all this could happen ; all this could happen . Blackout . End of play .
