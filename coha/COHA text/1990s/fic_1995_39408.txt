It has occurred to Ms. Mimi Adler , whom I like a lot , to wonder whether people reflexively think of their lives as stories because from birth to death they are exposed to so many narratives of every sort , or whether , contrariwise , our notion of what a " story " is , in every age and culture , reflects an innately dramatistic sense of life : a feature of the biological evolution of he human brain and of human consciousness , which appears to be essentially of a scenario-making character . <p> Ms. Adler 's question may strike the reader of these lines as idle , academic , inconsequential  --  and it 's certainly no grabber of an opening for a work of fiction , a bona fide short story . As I pen these words on my new friend 's behalf , is not Bosnia bleeding , have not Rwandans been slaughtering one another wholesale , are not 154 pounds of deadly weapons-grade plutonium still missing from a Japanese nuclear reactor , and does not Haiti 's immemorial misery more less drag on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round the planet ? In the face of so much wretchedness and gravity , what justification have Mimi and I for entertaining such chicken-or-egg questions as whether people 's lives or their stories have , so to speak , ontological primacy ? <p> That question , believe me , we take as seriously as we take the question that it questions . M 's coming on to fifty , my wife 's age , although you 'd never guess it by looking at either of those trim , athletic , handsome , and energetic women . Like Mrs. Narrator , Ms. Adler is a morally serious citizen and a dedicated teacher of young people . I myself am a dozen years older , Mimi 's husband 's a touch older yet , and you 'd guess that at once if you saw us with our spouses , although both Robert and I are in good shape for our age  --  anyhow , were , up to the time of this story . If less intense than our mates in the moral-political sphere , we , too , are unfrivolous professionals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from whose acquaintance with current theories of consciousness Mimi will have picked up what she knows about the biological evolution of our brains and their propensity for spinning scenarios in order to sort out the data continuously flooding all our senses : in short , our experience of life . Rob can not , however , speak to his wife 's late perplexity on this which-causes-which question , as he 's down in D.C. just now consulting for the National Institutes of Health . Yours truly , as aforenoted , makes up short stories  --  not for a living , as there 's no living in it , but for the serious pleasures of dreaming up characters like Mimi and Rob and situations like the one I 'm about to put them in ; of working out plots and forms and themes and images and actions and voices ( in a word , stories ) , and of finding the language wherewith to get those stories told . If that 's not seriousness enough , I also teach part-time in a good American university , coaching graduate-student apprentices in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's how I came to know M.A. ( so her initials just now suggest to me ) , whose husband , I here decide , I already knew slightly as an extra-departmental colleague . Our university 's M.A. story-making program is age-blind , you see , as well as gender-blind , ethnic-identity-blind , prior-degree-blind  --  blind to everything other than talent , accomplishment , and promise . When we 've sorted through the pile of applidations to select the dozen or so most likely-seeming , we 're pleased , of course , if they turn out to be a multi-culturally mixed bag of women and men , gays and straights , youngs and less youngs , ets and ceteras ; but as long as they 're the most evidently talented , accomplished , and promising of the lot , we do n't finally care ( so we tell ourselves ) if our dazzling dozen turn out to be uniformly middle-aged gay white lapsed-Mormon doctors of philosophy from Saskatchewan . The group five years ago numbered only one of those among the usual **33;61;TOOLONG smorgasbord , which happened also to include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew from reviewing the application files ) were poignant but playful " postmodern " spinoffs from notable scientific or philosophical propositions : Zeno 's paradoxes , Schrodinger 's wave-function equations , whatever . They wanted revision and polishing , to be sure , like the stories of everybody else in the program , toward closing those crucial last millimeters between gifted apprentice and truly professional work ; otherwise their authors would be applying to magazine editors instead of to us . The woman 's smile , however , needed no coaching at all : it was a brilliant , knowing , persistent , disconcerting smile that said , among other things , " We understand the subtext here , do n't we ? " and that would have been all the more unsettling if she had n't directed it at just about everyone to whom she spoke or listened . <p> My habit on opening day is to go around the seminar room asking each new hand in turn to tell , by way of introduction , what name you go by , where you hail from , by what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past training and experience in the yarning trade , what you have in mind to do in your season here , whatever else it pleaseth you to mention of an identificatory nature . When Ms. Adler 's turn came ( she sat , as she would invariably through that academic year , at the opposite end of the long seminar table from me , dressed in the oversized university sweatshirt and black running tights in which she routinely jogged the five miles from campus to her house after class ) , she beamed that mighty smile the length of the room , declared matter-of-factly , " Mi chiamo Mimi , " and then went on in her rich contralto speaking voice to give us her resume in an ad-lib paraphrase of that famous soprano aria from La Boheme . Most got the joke ; some did n't . From that subtextual smile of hers I could almost imagine that she had somehow guessed that Puccini , like tennis and sailing and the stories of Italo Calvino , had been among the touchstones of her new coach 's courtship and marriage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the woman proved at least an average apprentice fictioneer , a first-rate critic of her comrades ' efforts ( she really did see subtexts , sometimes significant ones , lurking between their lines ) , and perhaps the most generally liked of that year 's seminarians . Our cordial association continued , less closely , thereafter : the two couples at mixed-doubles tennis and certain university social events , Mimi and I at readings by visiting writers or tout court over occasional faculty-club lunches . As happens in more cases than not , her fiction , alas , for all its bright promise , got nowhere ; she had reached the distressingly familiar stage of doing nothing correctably wrong in her art , really , but of doing nothing on the other hand so remarkably well as to distinguish her productions from the thousands of others that every magazine and book editor remains deluged with . Fortunately for her ( now ex- ) coach , if not for herself , the critic in her was too exquisitely aware of this state of affairs to make its articulation incumbent upon me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except cross fingers and soldier on until her muse smiled , if the bitch ever relented . M 's own smile , at that , told me she was already onto some subtext between forkfuls of Caesar salad , but it was not one that I was privy to until early in the current semester , when over another such touch-base lunch she announced that her personal Boheme had reached Act Two 's closing curtain : in this restaging , no echt-nineteenth-century tuberculosis for the soprano , bur echt-late-twentieth AIDS for the tenor . <p> Rob ? AIDS ? No . <p> " Rob , AIDS. yes . " Her splendid mahogany eyes filled right up . " HIV-positive , anyhow , with AIDS to follow as doth the night ... the day ... " <p> That " day " trailed into suspension points and tears . When , in time , the tale got itself told ( in the faculty-club parking lot , whereto we retreated : for self-collection ) , it was of her steadfast , good-shape-for-his-age husband 's feeling lately so under the weather that even as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officially early in our institution ) , he underwent a physical exam more thorough than his routine annual checkups and thus learned the fatal news . <p> " So where 'd it come from ? " she said , sparing me the discomfort of asking . No extracurricular sexual contacts , her husband swore , since back in the hyperpermissive sixties , and his wife ( who at his urging had had herself tested and been shown HIV-negative ) saw no reason to question his fidelity . No needles except those in his doctor 's medical lab and Rob 's own cognitive-research facilities , where a certain amount of animal experimentation was carried on . Workers in such labs are not routinely tested for HIV ; given the standard sterile precautions of any well-run laboratory , however , the chances of accidental virus transmission in those venues must be near zero . Some while back he 'd had prostate surgery in the university hospital ; Mimi , who regarded hospitals as dangerous anyhow , believed that place and occasion the likeliest suspect  --  although the patient had had no blood transfusions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the land . Investigation was continuing . Through it all , my friend reported , her husband was being a brick , but Mimi herself and their two grown children were devastated , not only , in M 's case , by the prospect of losing to that revolting malady her best friend and life mate and the anticipated balance of their years together  --  as many as twenty , had luck been theirs , after which she had resolved to terminate promptly , with Seconal , her expected widowhood  --  but for at least two other reasons as well , which may strike the reader as unseemly , although I confess that I myself found them not difficult to sympathize with : <p> * The dreadful turn of events had the incidental effect of relegating Mimi Adler to a supporting role , as she saw it , in her own life story . More accurately ( for I protested this idea at once , as had Robert , and as even more vehemently did my wife , when I recounted the tale to her ) , it forced a radical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Gifted Middle School Teacher blossoming into Gifted Fiction Writer ( a scenario ever less tenable in any case ) , she had been recast as GMST obliged to become Heroic ( or not-so-heroic ) Nurse of Lovable and Competent but Otherwise Unremarkable Scientist . <p> These latter adjectives surprised me ; I can not dispute them , but had no idea that Mimi saw Rob so . Granted , she was distraught ; all the same , I sensed a subtext . Moreover , As aforementioned , she had become all but convinced that although she was not without literary talent , her gift was , finally , an amateur 's flair , not a true vocation ( I 'm afraid I agree , but I 'm not about to tell her so , and only in time will we know for sure ) , and so she would not have that enviable life preserver to help float her through her present pass and impending bereavement . She would be obliged to survive , if she chose to , on the strength of having been an okay mother , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife , a dedicated nurse of her husband 's terminality , and a more or less stoic widow perhaps devoted to worthy causes , unless she decided to go the Hemlock Society route and to hell with it . She 'd had more in mind , frankly , she told me ( my attention , for all my sympathy , was not undistracted by the subtext of that " **28;142;TOOLONG " ) : how was she to come to terms with mere above-averagehood , especially in the face of this miserable new plot twist , when all her life she had aspired to excel , to live transcendently ? <p> It was these reflections and their accompanying guilt , she declared  --  turning on that singular smile now while making free with the pocket tissue pack that I 'd proffered en route to the parking lot  --  that had led her to thinking in this new way about people 's lives as stories , et cetera , and thence to the question that this story opens with her pondering , quite as she might have opened one of her own . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions under the circumstances ( " Maybe she is , " my wife will allow ) ; if so , so be it . She just thought her erstwhile coach might be amused . <p> I forgive you that " amused , " I told her then and retell her now  --  and I trust the reader to grant that M 's introductory question was n't entirely frivolous after all . It 's going to have to wait for an answer , however , while the narrative camera cuts to a certain silver-alloy coin that fell out of my pants pocket onto the winter-dormant lawn of the faculty club as Mimi and I short-cut to the parking lot to avoid public display of her emotion and I fetched out in her behalf that little Kleenex pack . A Canadian twenty-five-cent piece , that coin was , picked up casually in Toronto some while earlier when I happened to be author-touring up that way , and not yet recycled into some Baltimore parking meter ( although to my eye all North American quarters are of identical dimension , soft-drink machines know the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ II D. G. REGINA in classic starboard profile ; on the other a bull moose portside ditto , haloed by CANADA 1984 and bearing in his mighty antler rack the declared value 25 CENTS . On both faces a circle of raised dots just inside the milled edge , to complicate counterfeiting . The I character did n't notice his loss and never will : nor did my stressed-out lunch companion . The I narrator of this stories-of-our-lives story , on the other hand , not only observed but caused the coin 's fall from right trouser pocket to campus grass , to the end of informing or reminding the reader , by association , of a certain schoolroom narrative exercise , called " L'histoire d'un sou , " that used to be assigned in the French lycees . Imagine and recount the adventures of a common coin , that exercise demanded , as it circulates from hand to hand through one 's society : perhaps from mint to bank and anon to some aristocratic lady 's purse , thence serially to the pocket of that lady 's pilfering chambermaid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young prostitute whose services that shopkeeper occasionally hires , to that prostitute 's illegitmate but much-prized five-year-old son , Rodolfe ; ( by the aristocratic lady 's philandering husband , as it happens ) , to that lad 's bullying seven-year-old alleymate , Victor , who snatches and runs off with it , to the gutter of the cobbled Montmartre street into which Victor darts and fearless little Rodolfe pursues him just in time to be struck by the aristocratic husband 's carriage , and thence , tossed away by the conscience-stricken Victor , down the storm drain of that street into the sewers of Paris , where it goes unnoticed by Jean Valjean , in flight from the detective Javert , but not by that keen-eyed latter , who , though not an otherwise superstitious fellow , pauses for two seconds to pick it up lest tout lejour he have bad luck and thereby , ironiquement , affords Valjean the opportunity to elude him at least for another chapter . In analogous wise , this particular Canadian quarter in its ten-year tour of duty had passed through 240 hands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a range from ten seconds ( given as change in what must have been the only gay bar in Saskatoon , Saskatchewan , in 1986 , to a lapsed-Mormon Ph.D . candidate from Moose Jaw , and by him promptly passed to the friend with whom he was splitting the tab ) to three years ( in the **27;172;TOOLONG ashtray of the Florida apartment of a Bahamian real-estate speculator whose travels took her to Canada occasionally but not often ) , before being given to me , again as change , in the delightful **27;201;TOOLONG Movenpick Marche in downtown Toronto , where that lady happened to have shopped and lunched on the same day that my wife and I happened to shop and dine there in mid-book tour . Now , on a Maryland February afternoon , it lies nearly vertical against blades of hybrid lawn grass on a seldom-crossed sward of faculty-club turf , and there it could remain " forever , " perhaps mashed into the soil , come spring , by the riding mowers of campus groundskeepers and gradually thatched and sedimente over , the narrative camera locked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camera upon the Empire State Building in his 1964 film Empire ; or perhaps accidentally excavated a year or a century hence by a crew relandscaping the area or digging footers for an extension of the building and examined by the **27;230;TOOLONG finder for lucky numbers to use in playing the state lottery , thence on with its story . <p> In fact ( so to speak ) , however , it gets noticed no more than an hour later by another colleague of mine , whom I 've never met personally but know to be an art historian with a minor , as it were , in conchology , from which hobby he has acquired the half-conscious habit of keeping a beachcomber 's eye out even in the city . An unorthodox fellow in several respects , Associate Professor Walter Ellison believes that paths should be laid where people walk , literally and figuratively , rather than constraining folks ' walking to already-laid paths , and so he makes it his pedestrian practice , especially on campus , to take the most direct or otherwise convenient route to his destination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a sort of service to the university 's landscape planners . Shortcutting like Mimi and me-the-character to the parking lot that she and I have already exited in our separate cars ( M to go on with the grimly plot-turned story whereof she is the reluctant , ineluctable protagonist , I with the exfoliation of this , whereof I am teller-in-chief but wherein I have only a walk-on , drive-off role ) , young Professor Ellison espies " my " coin in the grass and , recalling the folk-rhyme advisory , bends over as if to pick it up but in fact merely to inspect it before perversely letting it lie in order to defy , on principle , proverbial wisdom . Although Walt 's only thirty-five and is in good physical condition from playing indoor tennis twice or thrice weekly at a suburban club , the muse of irony sees fit at this point cruelly to inflict upon him what will turn out to be a lifelong intermittent spinal-disk problem in consequence of that simple movement . Some fluke of leverage , one supposes ; in any case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coin and car he hobbles in a sweat and at one moment nearly faints . It 's all he can do to ease himself into his vintage bean-green Volvo wagon and drive home . By the time he reaches his Mount Washington neighborhood , his lumbar area has so seized up that he groans involuntarily at every major movement from driveway to lavatory ( where he helps himself to a tablet of Valium ) to living-room rug , a second-hand Heriz on whose central medallion he lies supine for the next two hours , until Barbara comes home from her new job in the reference department of the Enoch Pratt Free Library . She 's alarmed . He explains . She commiserates , and doses her recently anxious self with the Valium long ago prescribed for Walter 's wry neck by the same physician who , as it irrelevantly happens , diagnosed Rob Adler 's AIDS ( the drug , anyhow expired , will prove less effective in and for her case than as a simple muscle relaxant in her husband 's ) . The couple then settle into a pained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both Valiumed , in lieu of their customary glass of California chardonnay they sip with their trail-mix hors d'oeuvres a very weak solution of jug chablis and club soda , once Walt has gotten himself propped against the couch-front . Even raising the wineglass in ironic toast to the muse of irony  --  for they 're scheduled to vacation next week at the Club Medit in Cancin , their first such holiday , where they 've been looking forward to tennis , snorkeling , beachcombing , and touring the nearby Mayan ruins-makes him ouch . <p> " So what was your most interesting call today ? " he asks her as usual , though it 's not usually in so clenched a voice . Barbara works the Pratt 's **29;259;TOOLONG desk  --  " doing kids ' homework for them , " she complains , for indeed they 'll call to say , ? " I 'm writing this paper for eighth grade ? Can you tell me about Spain ? " <p> " Nothing terrific . Some lady wanted Erwin Schrodinger 's equation for quantum-mechanical wave functions , and I tracked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read it to her . I mean , it 's not like saying : ' E equals , mc squared , ' you know ? The thing 's humongous and full of hierooglyphics . Then some guy needed the name and date of that Warhol flick where the camera stays fixed forever on the Empire State Building  --  " <p> " Empire . Sixty-eight or - nine ? Aiyi ! " <p> " Poor thing . Sixty-four . " As to Cancun , they incline two days later to go on with the trip , although a statement from Walter 's doctor would entitle them to a refund of their prepayment . Thanks in part to a fresh prescription , the back pain has eased somewhat each day ; need the break  --  especially Barb , who finds life more stressful lately than does her inner-directed mate . They 'll be able at least to read and sunbathe and eat and drink and perhaps visit the Tulum ruins down-coast from Cancun  --  maybe even snorkel the reefs , carefully , on calm days . <p> Do they go ? Go they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by nature , whose notion of holiday has historically been either wall-to-wall museum touring or serious amateur conchology , merely hopes that their first real vacation-vacation wo n't be spoiled and that his pulled muscle or pinched nerve or slipped disk wo n't prove to be an ongoing or recurring disability ( alas , it will ) . He has come to depend on vigorous physical exercise , like sustained mental work , as a safety valve in his life with Barbara  --  a non-athlete and a bit of a complainer lately . She hopes the same , of course , for her sake as well as his ; notwithstanding his inner and outer strengths , her husband 's a real baby , in her opinion , on the rare occasions when anything 's physically amiss with him , whereas she , at any given moment in her life story , will likely be bearing up pretty stoically , without medication , under half a dozen assorted minor ailments . Perhaps that discontent is why , only three weeks into her job at the Pratt and just a week before this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself to go to bed with an attractive and rather famous senior departmental colleague of her husband 's : an unmarried programmatic flirt who Walter himself suspects is either gay or asexual but who turned out  --  in the remarkable episode that followed one of the fellow 's periodic consultancy visits to the Pratt 's fine-arts collection , his coincidental path-crossing with Barbara as both were leaving the building at the end of her workday , his offering her a lift home in his bronze-gold Lexus to save her cab fare ( Barb 's little Honda was being serviced ) , and his all but daring her , en route , to stop in for a look at the rather grand condo he recently bought in a spiffy new high-rise overlooking the university  --  to be a decidedly more energetic and imaginative lover , on first and second go at least , than her husband of seven years . Now she is , if not quite guilt-stricken , at least guilt-nagged , all the more because , with poor Walt hors de combat , on the day before their Club Med @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ostensibly to tell him that she had really admired his new place , and that of the two bedroom-drapery fabrics about which he 'd asked her opinion , she definitely recommended the darker , " stronger " one with the seashell motif . " I value your input , Barbara , " he had replied in his only slightly accented but heavily testosteronic baritone . No mention , however , of his having enjoyed , as had she , their surprising roll in his high-rise hay ; no insinuating suggestion that perhaps she would like to have a look at the seashell drapes when they were made and hung . Mortification , to have cheated on her husband with , of all people , the acting chair of his department , and to have been by him judged , perhaps , no good in bed ! It makes her want to climb all over her ailing seatmate now in contrite reaffirmation of their marriage bond  --  but apart from the unseemliness of such behavior , the long charter flight has made Walt 's back at least temporarily even sorer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expanse of Yucatan , her head begins to throb in a way that she can almost imagine signals migraine . She removes the prescription sunglasses that , for one reason or another , she has lately taken to wearing indoors as well as out , and massages the bridge of her nose . The ache neither disappears nor , thank heaven , comes on more strongly . <p> After they 've checked in , along with a festive busload of other new arrivals , been assigned their simple but comfortable quarters , and at Barbara 's suggestion pushed the twin beds together to make one large one ( she has to do most of the pushing ) , she asks , " Could we maybe sack out for a while before we explore the place ? " Walt is disinclined at first  --  he did n't come to Yucatan to nap through this **31;290;TOOLONG vacation  --  but then he sees that napping is not what she has in mind , and although he 'd rather reconnoiter the resort 's impressive . spread and hit the beach , he tries to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get on top , " he tells her . <p> She smiles behind her dark glasses . " That can be arranged . " Moreover , when they 're almost undressed , she surprises him by suggesting that they remove each other 's underpants with their teeth . <p> " Hot damn , " her husband responds , assuming she 's joking , and with his hands whisks off first his own briefs and then hers . In fact , however , she was quite serious : in her session with Franco , he not only had insisted that Barbara bestride him with her sunglasses in place ( " So barbaric , " he had teased ) but had proposed , as they subsequently redressed , that next time they undress each other with their teeth . It was her amused excitement at that prospect that had prompted her follow-up phone call : a disappointment , but surely for the best . <p> " Take those damn glosses off , " Walt now mock-colds her when she bestrides him  --  just as she was about to reach back and down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Franco ... <p> " Is n't it sexier like this ? " Smiling , he reaches up and removes the offending item . " I like to see who it is I 'm making love with , okay ? " He folds the ear-pieces and sets the sunglasses on a nightstand . Feeling her headache rethreaten , Barbara declares , " It 's just the same old wife as always , " and hobbyhorses him straight to ejaculation so that she can dismount , dose herself with aspirin , and get those glasses back on . " Rain check , " she tells him when he makes to reciprocate orally . <p> But as she unfolds the eyeglasses ( before even washing up ) , one hinge screw works loose and drops out , and the earpiece comes off in her hand . <p> " Oh , God . We 've got to find it ! " Naked on all fours she goes , searching the rugless quarry-tile floor in vain for the tiny screw . <p> " What am I going to do ? " She 's borderline frantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her startled husband reasonably supposes that all eyeglass-hinge screws are alike , unless some are metric and some not ; they can buy the cheapest pait of overpriced non-prescription shades in the club 's boutique and use one of its screws to replace hers . <p> " It 'll never work ! " She sits Turk-fashion on the bare tiles , head in hands . " What am I going to do with my life ? " Surprised at her near hysteria , Walt does his best to calm her  --  " Jesus , Barb ! "  --  although experience has taught him that his efforts in this line are as liable to aggravate as to soothe . <p> The headache comes on : in fact , her first full-fledged migraine . To bed she retreats , not for sport this time . Seeing their vacation week on the verge of going down the drain , Walt half ruefully , half resentfully goes to check out the boutique as proposed , acquiescing , however , to his wife 's insistence that he buy nothing in the way of sunglasses until she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reckless with their money . He finds , of course , sun glasses aplenty for sale there  --  muchos pesos per pair , but so what , compared with the cost of this trip ? If the parts prove incompatible , perhaps he can use a screw from his own eyeglasses to repair his wife 's and then jury-rig his with a paper clip scrounged from the establishment 's business office . He strolls the hibiscus-and bougainvillearich grounds , noting bitterly that their luckier plane-and-bus mates are already enjoying the magnificent beach and the splendid Mexican Caribbean out there  --  its reefs abounding , no doubt , in jim-dandy shells . <p> Back at their room he finds a note on the dresser : Sorry to 've come unhinged ( ! ) Gone to infirmary . Do n't follow ; will be okay . Will look for you on beach . Love you . <p> His resentment melts , leaving only pity and affection ; he knows he 's not the easiest person in the world to live with either , and he does n't for a moment doubt the bond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their beach bag with towels , sun lotions , his snorkeling mask , a plastic shell-identification card , and a book on Mayan artifacts , and advises his wife , on the back of her note to him , to look for him and/or he bag on the narrow stretch of beach just in front of their unit . <p> To reach that stretch properly , one is meant to follow a paved and landscaped walk for several hundred yards toward the club 's central buildings , to the pool area and main beach access , and then backtrack along the strand itself , which is separated from the landscaped grounds by a low fence atop a five-foot embankment . Walt , however , takes the direct route , picking up a white plastic lounge chair as he crosses the lawn . That chair 's one-piece molded curves-designed for nested stacking and for reclining in average though nonadjustable comfort  --  remind him of recumbent stone figures of the Mayan god Chacmool , ubiquitous in the region . Full-size replicas stand at the sort 's entrance , and miniatures are for sale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hefts the chair over the fence and slides it down the bank , and then climbs over and down after it with their beach bag . He has the strip to himself . " Chacmool " he positions where Barbara is most likely to notice it from their second-floor balcony , and he sets the bag in plain view on the chair 's belly , so to speak  --  just as , if he remembers correctly , sacrificial victims were once positioned on the original . Then he wets his mask lens with saliva against fogging and , at last , enters the welcoming sea . <p> The water is warm , clear , and beautiful , with a moderate current from upshore , where the main beach is . Without swim fins ( he means to borrow a pair from the snorkeling shack after Barb settles down ) it takes a bit of effort to hover in place ; he can more easily ride downstream on the current and walk back . He does that for a hundred yards or so , admiring the clean sand bottom , the mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top shell or other mollusk , which he inspects and identifies but refrains on principle from collecting . No Barbara in sight when he returns to Chacmool . Deciding that the beach bag is reasonably safe , he walks in the other direction  --  farther this time , perhaps a quarter mile  --  to the edge of the main bathing area , in order to snorkel the current home . <p> His wife 's surprising question  --  " What am I going to do with my life ? "  --  haunts him as he oats . He knows himself to be an anti-dramatic , even a plodding , soul , at least in contrast to her higher-strung sensibility ; he can not imagine putting that question to himself , for example , in the absence of objective crisis , such as disablement so crippling that he could n't work , or the loss of his wife to accident or disease ( divorce does n't occur to him ; over the course of their marriage he has been tempted no more to infidelity than to illegal drugs , nor has he ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes regrets , even keenly , their not having children , especially when he 's with his young nieces and nephews , but he finally shrugs at his infertility , as at his not being wealthy or movie-star handsome , and gets on with it . What is he going to do with his life ? He 's going to snorkel this stretch of sea floor ; read up on the Mayans or beachcomb or both ; go to dinner this evening ; perhaps try tennis manana , if his back permits ( the swimming seems to help it ) ; and then tour the Tulum ruins , where he particularly looks forward to viewing the astronomically calibrated temples of Marriage and Birth ... <p> A nonmarine something on the bottom catches his eye , rolling lazily with the current over a sandy patch between coral rocks ten feet under : a pair of sunglasses , of all things , in design rather like Barbara 's , though with hot-pink frames rather than black . Amused ( and careful of his back ) , he dives and retrieves them , noting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moves freely . If the lenses were prescription-ground , he would turn the glasses in at the reception desk ; as they 're not  --  just an ordinary pair of ladies ' shades , perhaps knocked off some bikini 'd young miss up-beach an hour or two ago as she frolicked with her boyfriend in the gentle surf  --  he 'll cannibalize them in Barb 's behalf , and reassemble and return them if the experiment fails . Truly , although he can understand his mate 's despairing question in a hypothetical way , at gut level he finds it virtually incomprehensible . <p> There she is , he sees now , in the downshore distance : a fetchingly bikini 'd and sun-visored miss herself , stretched out on Senor Chacmool with the bag beside her and reading a book . That last he takes for a hopeful sign , as is her apparently making shift with her one-stemmed sunglasses instead of throwing up her hands . He tucks his treasure into the crotch of his swimsuit and happily strokes herward . <p> Shading her eyes with one hand , Barbara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his forehead ( her own forehead , though less ax-edged than before , still feels like a seismic fault about to let go ) . He reaches down into the front of his swimsuit as if to expose himself . <p> " Hubby to the rescue ! " <p> " Where 'd you get those ? " <p> " Frutas de mar , and more where these came from . " Pattering on , he rummages through the beach bag . " Want to check for yourself ? How 's your head these days , by the way ? " <p> " A wreck . But it 'll pass . " <p> " All passes , " he intones , fishing out the Swiss Army knife that he carries with him everywhere ; " art alone endures . John Ruskin ? Omar Khayyim ? Art Garfunkel ? " He has expected to have to use the point of the knife 's smaller cutting blade to unscrew the hinge , but finds to his gratified surprise that while the main screwdriver/cap-lifter blade is , as he anticipated , too broad and thick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's a finer , narrower screwdriver tip that he 'd never particularly noticed , evidently designed for just such employment . " Ah , those Swiss , " he natters happily . " I hope our army never has to cross knives with their army . Voila ! " He displays the minuscule part in the palm of his hand . " We lose this one , we 've still got a spare . The patient , please . " <p> " The earpiece is up in our room . " <p> No matter , he replies ; he can anyhow test the threads . Better yet , they 'll start a new fashion . In less than a minute he has installed a hot-pink left-side earpiece in place of the absent black one . " If the screw fits , wear it , " he proposes . Or he can restore the original next time they 're in their room ; or she can go pink both port and starboard ; or they can mix and match each time she takes her shades off to bestride him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , presenting her with the odd-looking but perfectly serviceable specs . " On with the story ? " <p> To his dismay , he sees she 's weeping and shaking her head . For a moment he fears he 's done something amiss  --  but now she takes in both her hands not the sunglasses but his hand , and covers it with tears and kisses , sobbing the most soul-wrenched , soul-wrenching sobs that he has ever in his innocent life heard the human animal give forth , although in truth it is capable of much greater . <p> The loser of those serendipitously found sunglasses , Mme. Jacqueline Masson , of Lyons , France , is , as happens , neither young nor currently bikini 'd nor a miss , nor was she frolicking with a boyfriend in the surf at time of loss , although she has been and done all of the above in years gone by . A veteran member of Club Mediterranee , at age fifty she has vacationed in some two dozen of that organization 's resorts over as many winters . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her husband inclined to the literally Mediterranean clubs or , of the Caribbean ones , those in departments of France  --  namely , Martinique and Guadeloupe . Moreover , it is her first vacation trip as a widow , in the company of women friends from Lyons instead of her dear Bertrand , a physician in that city who succumbed to leukemia just about this time last year . Three days into this experiment , she supposes it 's going neither well nor badly . Her two friends , somewhat younger ( one recently divorced , the other " on holiday " from spouse and children ) , have been consistently animated , even festive  --  in part , no doubt , to keep her own spirits up . They have flirted harmlessly with the handsome young Gentils Organisateurs who manage the sports and other activities ; they 've tasked together at the rowdy American teenagers and the resort 's cuisine , which is generally inferior to that of the clubs they 're used to and is directed , they 're convinced , at less discriminating Yankee and Canadian appetites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tennis and have even tried windsurfing . In amused defiance of Mexican law ( nobody seems really to care ) they have declared a certain stretch of beach at the far end of the resort topless , and have been gratified to see half a dozen other women guests of various ages and nationalities follow their bare-breasted lead . Solange , the divorce , today even proposed escalation to total nudity ; proud of her still-sleek derrire , she wears bikini bottoms with only the tiniest of triangles in front and a mere string up the cleft behind  --  but even that , she has reminded them , is more than they would be cumbering themselves with at Guadeloupe 's Caravelle or Martinique 's Buccaneer Creek . <p> " Vive la France , " Edith agreed , and although her body at forty-six is holding up less well than Jacqueline 's at fifty , not to mention Solange 's at forty , she took the lead in going bottomless on the spot  --  which happened to be hip-deep in the gentle surf . <p> " Pour la patrie ! " Solange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over herhead like a banner . <p> " Libert egalite , sororite , " lacqueline affirmed , and bent to follow suit just as a somewhat larger wave pushed her off balance . Hobbled at the ankles by her dropped bikini , she tumbled with a little whoop and was unable simultaneously to slip her feet out of the garment and to hold her sunglasses in place . When she regained her footing , the swimsuit bottom was in hand , the glasses were gone , and all three women were laughing merrily . <p> " La , la ! " Solange pointed at a hot-pink flash on the sand-stirred bottom , and redoubtable Edith dived for it , but the : undertow of the approach next wave swept the glasses out of sight . Their loser shrugged : Tant pis . She would be stopping at the boutique anyhow before dinner , for postcards , would buy another pair . A trifle . <p> But in fact the little loss provokes an inward sigh : she bought those particular sunglasses in Agadir , Morocco , five or six years back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few days at the old original Club Med there , and they subsequently became her unofficial beach-holiday specs . Her marriage , she supposes , was f exqraordinarily satisfying , but it was at least ordinarily so ; she misses it and her also ; ways-too-busy husband terribly ( his terminal illness was the most time they 'd spent together since ; their honeymoon ) . Her grown son , the image of his father , rather bores her , and his wife she can scarcely abide . As for her women friends , bless them , they were , altogether more enjoyable as supplementary companions than they are as the principal ones that , faute de mieux , they have become for her ; Solange is quite naturally more involved with her current lover back home , Edith with both her husband and her current lover back home , than either is with her . The naked trio now wades ashore , animatedly disagreeing en route to their towel-spread lounge chairs as to whether the several American and two an members of their unacknowledged topless sorority will presently join @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the resort 's perimeter ( who has plainly observed but so far chosen to ignore their rule-flouting ) will feel moved to nip this escalation in the bud , so to speak . <p> Jacqueline Masson supposes that she 'll become accustomed to the horrid emptiness of her present life and gradually fill it with other interests . Just now , however , she is so bored with its pointlessly ongoing story that she wishes she could simply close and toss it like a tiresome book  --  the way that sexy American girl , at the moment the women pass , tosses her paperback onto the sand beside the molded-plastic beach chair in which she has been lolling like Venus on the half shell , pulls her Oakland A 's baseball cap down over her face , and rests her head on her upraised arms , lifting her perfect breasts as if to make them declare , " Here we are , guys ; resist us if you can . " <p> That as if is not Mme. Masson 's : she takes only the most perfunctory woman-to-woman notice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her companions , exits this narrative to deal with her unenviable own ( while , just offshore , the moderate undercurrent tumbles like a vagrant subtext a certain pair of hot-pink sunglasses along the sandy sea floor , leisurely under the moored Mistral sailboards and Laser sailboats ; among the feet of bathers at the central swimming area , marked with floats to warn off water-skiers and windsurfers ; thence downbeach toward where another rule-flouter has dragged a lounge chair over the low-fenced bank from the landscaped lawn of the guest compounds down that way ) . No : those salivary tropes are courtesy of William Allen Wentworth III , American teenager for the four months remaining till his twentieth birthday , for whom the spectacle of three middle-aged French or French-Canadian ( anyhow , French-speaking ) women wading merrily naked from the gentle surf merely makes delectable the Playboy-centerfoldworthy blonde in orange bakini pants and Oakland A 's cap , off whom he has scarcely been able to take his eyes for the past three quarters of an hour . Praise God for sunglasses , which permit one shamelessly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretending to draft a letter to one 's parents , back in Cincinnati , Ohio , explaining why , after a prolonged soul-search , one has decided to drop out of the University of Virginia in one 's sophomore year in order  --  after a bit of R &R; south of the border on the of one 's " college " inheritance from Grandpa Bill  --  to pursue what one is all but certain now is one 's true calling : the management not of Wentworth Office Systems , Inc. , the half-century-old family firm , but of sound-and-light effects for heavy-metal rock concerts . Although he shares the lanky build and troubled facial complexion : of those rowdy Yank youngsters tut-tutted by Mme. Masson , likewise their unseasoned mien and their currently de rigueur uniform of clunky black basketball shoes ( unlaced ) , long baggy shorts , oversized T-shirt , and backward ball cap , Bill Three is a polite and rather shy boy , actually , indifferently successful with girls , more at ease with the unambiguous signal lamps , switches , and meters of an electronic console @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has had his eye increasingly on Ms. February ( so he ca n't help thinking of the awesome blonde in the Oakland A 's cap ) since her arrival yesterday  --  Bill himself is three days into his unauthorized vacation  --  and has spent most of today virtually stalking her , so taken is he with her physical beauty and , more and more , with the way she handles herself . Among his impressions : <p> * As " American " as she looks ( to William the Third , this adjective still reflexively connotes white-Anglo derivation , although he certainly knows better and gets along quite agreeably with his peers of other ethnicity ) , her name has an exotic , sort of Middle Eastern sound in his ears , at least as it 's pronounced by the Chef du Village and other GOs with whom he has seen her speaking animatedly from time to time , both in English and in French : Jedee , Zhedi , something like that . <p> * Like himself , she 's unaccompanied . She has doubtless been assigned a roommate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one day to the next ) , but she prefers to move about on her own . He has observed her , more gregarious and athletic than himself , playing power volleyball on the beach ( she sets up a mean spike ) , dancing energetically at the disco , and laughing and chatting with the GOs and her fellow GMs ( Gentils Membres ) in the buffet-style main restaurant . Nevertheless , she appears to be essentially content with her own company : Bill takes it as a mark of their shared independent-spiritedness that while most of their coevals lounge sociably about at poolside between activities , Zhedi , like him , prefers the uncrowded far end of the beach . As enchanting as is her meticulous sun-lotioning of that perfect body , as yet untanned , in his opinion she is not displaying herself to encourage approach ; she 's simply taking the sun , reading and communing with herself between sessions of physical and social activity . He admires that , and also the unaffected friendliness of her conversation awhile ago with the similarly topless and not at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown-nippled jugs the young man classifies as more coffee-almond-fudge than vanilla ; Ms. Feb evidently does n't regard other attractive females ipso facto as rivals . Bill 's sense of her , moreovere 'll readily grant that here his imagination is running free  --  is that she herself goes topless- not out of exhibitionism ( like that older , French trio ) but simply for the pleasures of nonrestraint and , perhaps , unaggressive nonconformity . <p> * She has , withal , has Ms. Zhedi/Jedee/Whatever , an air of unassuming self-possession and general maturity for her age that young B Three ( as his Virginia musician friends call him ) finds almost as impressive as her lovely face and magnificent near-nude body ; her refreshing absence of affectation both encourages and intimidates him . He guesses she 's a year or two older than he is , and feels that differential as acutely as he used to back in high school days . Could she possibly find him interesting ? Just possibly , he decides : in a freshman-year computer-science class at UVA he was befriended by a girl less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who actually asked him out before he could ask her ; they had " related " with an ease and reciprocal interest unprecedented in his experience , and might well have gotten it on as a couple if he had n't still been honorably carrying a torch for Karen Baker , his high school girlfriend ( who turned out to be already involved with another guy , at her own university , in Vermont ) . <p> At exactly this juncture in our narrative , Chance presents William Allen Wentworth III with a chance indeed to test this possibility . As the three topless-and now bottomless !  --  French-speaking ladies emerged laughing from the surf and strolled past Zhedi en route to their beach chairs , she casually dropped her paperback onto the sand beside her , lay back in her own chair , pulled her ball cap down over her face , and tucked her hands behind her head , with the aforenoted salivary effect on the observer . A breeze now ruffles the leaves of that book and blows a loose page free of it , almost directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the half-drafted letter of explanation to his parents , piles out of his lounge chair , and makes a diving interception before the precious leaf can flutter past him down the beach and maybe into the water . <p> Gatcha ! he exults to himself . He brushes sand from his shorts , restraightens his cap ( Cincinnati Reds , a different league altogether from Oakland 's ; they might discuss that ) , carefully uncrumples the shortstopped paper , and considers how best to head for first base . Neither Ms. F. nor the Italian/Latino woman nor the Frenchies appear to have noticed his flurry of action . His impulse is straightforwardly to return the book page  --  " Excuse me , ma'am ; this is yours , I think '  --  and , depending on her reaction , take it from there . That 's how his buddy Fred Sims , drummer and backup singer with Cold Fusion , back in Charlottesville , and cocksman extraordinaire , would do it : " If she does n't cover her tits when you say hello , " Fred would advise him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the other hand , it might make better sense to wait until she puts her top back on before approaching her : " Did n't want to bother you while you were catching the rays , " et cetera ( wink , wink ) . He bets she 'd appreciate his thoughtfulness . <p> To gather his nerve and consider his options , he returns to his chair , smooths the page out on his clipboard , and scans it ; some idea of what she 's reading might give him a good opener . Although B Three himself reads next to nothing , as a rule , except from video-display terminals , and did poorly in his college literature courses ( which anyhow had more to do with ethnic and gender politics than with art ) , and although he takes for granted that what is n't electronic is n't relevant , except maybe historically , he has from time to time enjoyed specimens of science fiction and " cyberpunk " ; maybe he and she can discuss that . From his monitoring of Zhedi/Jedee , he ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither his life experience nor his imagination affords him much sense of the range of possibilities , either in literature or in the reading proclivities of young women . <p> Out of context , at least , neither side of pp. 123-124 ( so the leaf is numbered on its upper outboard corners ) makes much sense to its present reader . A more knowledgeable and perceptive eye than B Three 's might register that since the leaf 's recto ( 123 ) happens to conclude one chapter of or selection from the overall text , and the verso ( 124 ) therefore to begin another , the title of the book itself-which would normally appear as a running head on the left-hand , even-numbered page  --  is missing ; and further , that inasmuch as no author 's name appears under the ( unnumbered ) title of the item commencing on 124 , the unnamed book must consist of articles , stories , or whatever by a single ( unnamed ) hand rather than by various authors . Neither a novel page on the one hand , then ( if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page on the other . What Bill registers is simply that the three lines constituting page 123 ( under the running subhead Stories of Our Lives ) read less like fiction than like Bill ca n't say what . " rolls it lightly seaward , " the page begins in mid-sentence , ending some paragraph from the page before . The next paragraph , a pair of rhetorical fragments , reads " Rwanda , Haiti , Bosnia , Kurdistan . The doomed Marsh Arabs . " And the one after that , " The web of the world . " <p> Over his head . <p> Page 124 is more promising , perhaps because it opens a missing text rather than closing one . " Any line at all can start a story , " it begins ( under the title " Once Upon a Time " ) ; to which proposition some girl , it seems , replies , " Oh ? " ; to which reply the guy ( " Sheila 's new lover , " he 's called a few lines later ) responds , in effect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' et cetera , and hang it between quotes as a line of dialogue , and what you get is something like ' Any line at all , ' Sheila 's new lover declared to her on the balcony of her parents ' condo in Perdido Key , Florida , where the couple had run off together for a long autumn weekend and were currently lounging naked in mid-October morning sunlight , ' can start a story , ' and off we go . " <p> Cool , Bill agrees , impressed ; but then , he 's disposed to be impressed by anything associated with Ms. Zhedi-Feb over yonder , who has risen yet a notch higher in his estimation . Brains , too ! <p> " Bonjour , Zhayrdee ! " he hears called now in a rich baritone ( he had n't noticed the r sound in her name before , actually overriding the d ) , and there 's stocky , sun-browned , black-curled Marcel , the much-muscled and high-spirited Chef du Village , in his round-lensed , wire-rimmed specs , his shell necklace , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prefer to boxer trunks , not to mention knee-length " jams . " <p> " Bonjour , Marcel , " Ms. Feb replies smoothly , once she has lifted her cap to see who 's saluting her . Just as smoothly , as Mar-sayl hunkers beside her chair to exchange pleasantries ( he patrols the beach twice daily , Bill has observed , socializing with the GMs ) , she fetches from behind her back the orange bra of her swimsuit and unhurriedly dons it . Bye-bye , sweet Hagen-Dazzlers . <p> " You weel be on ze red team in tomorrow 's games , okay ? " Marcel amiably proposes , and displays a handful of the colored-yarn wristbands used to distinguish the competing teams in the club 's weekly " Olympics . " <p> " S'il vous plait , " Zhayrdee replies in pert and perfectly accented French  --  so it sounds to B Three , at least . Then she adds , in her pure network American , " Wherever I 'm needed . " <p> " Red team , " Marcel affirms . " We meet at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Entendu . " She obligingly extends her right wrist for banding , and with her left hand adjusts her hair while the Chef du Village ties on the red yarn . The pair then chat awhile further in French , less jocularly ( she even shows him what she 's reading , and Marcel makes Gallic exclamations of approval ) , before bidding each other a cordial au revoir . <p> The heart of William Allen Wentworth III is stirred by an emotion complex and potentially dangerous to his self-esteem . He understands not a word of the pair 's conversation , nor would he have if it had been in any language other than his own . For perhaps the first time , it occurs to him that it would be desirable  --  that it would be , in very truth , more cool  --  if such were not the case ; if he could converse easily , animatedly , and seriously with people of backgrounds other than his . It is not , finally , difficult for him to acknowledge that a fellow like himself does n't stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not simply because she 's almost movie-star gorgeous but because she is ( evidently ) knowledgeable , sophisticated , and serious as well as " fun-loving "  --  in every way superior to anyone he has ever dated or been at all close to , the Virginia computer-science girl included . It is quite another matter , however , for him to see in another light , as now he dimly begins to , how " a fellow like himself " must appear to the likes of Zhayrdee and Marcel . When and if that light becomes clearer , he may chasteningly understand that real cool consists in impressive competencies together with firm principles and a degree of worldliness  --  that is to say , in capability , character , and polish  --  rather than in any particular costume and attitude ; that to the excellent likes of Zhayrdee , nothing could be less cool than to be cool by his and Fred Sims 's standards ; that , in fact , he probably appears to her ridiculous : a clown , a creep . <p> " Red ream ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tour of the beach . <p> " Nah , I guess not . " <p> " You do n't want to play ? Is just for fun , okay ? " <p> What a dork he thinks I am , thinks wretched Bill , who lamely smiles and says again , " Guess not , thanks . " <p> " So , " the Chef du Village says with a shrug , already scanning down the line . " Maybe you change your mind later , okay ? " To the Italian or Latino woman he now calls , " Red team ? " She flashes teasingly at him her blue wrist yarn and calls something back in what sounds to Bill like Italian but might as well be Greek . Marcel replies animatedly in the same tongue and goes to hunker beside her lounge chair ; the woman does n't even bother to cover her chocolate-kiss breasts . <p> Zhaydee , Bill glumly observes , has gone back to her book . <p> For reasons that he is barely equipped to analyze , W.A.W. III will not much enjoy the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cincinnati a version of his dropout letter and return to Charlottesville just in time to join Cold Fusion for an extended gig in Chapel Hill and another in Durham before the band disbands over a feud between drummer and bassist on the one hand and lead guitarist and female vocalist-tambourinist on the other . Thereafter he 'll make his way across the United States of America and back with Fred Sims , picking up random work here and there for a couple of years and eventually mending fences with his indulgent parents . In his mid-twenties he 'll enter the family business after all , marry and sire children upon some clone of Karen Baker , and devote the decent balance of his life to his family and to Wentworth Office Systems , Inc.  --  which enterprise , however , will not prosper under his uninspired stewardship . In years to come he 'll remember his abortive road tour with Cold Fusion as being , in its way , the most satisfying episode in his entire listless life story . Although his recollection of it decades hence will include his bolting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recall his uncharacteristic stalking and ogling of young Ms. Geraldine " Gerri " Fraser , of Palo Alto , California  --  with whom , really , he has next to nothing in common beyond WASP ethnicity and U.S. citizenship . He slumps back into his beach chair , crumples into a ball the sibylline page that was to have been their link , sidearms it onto the sand , pulls his Cincinnati Reds cap over his face , and for a considerable while stares wide-eyed and soul-troubled at its convergent seams and evenly spaced ventilation grommets . <p> Ms. Fraser  --  B.S. Stanford . summa cum laude and currently a second-year student at the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions  --  may happen to have the face and figure of Playboy 's centerfold of the month , but from kindergarten to the present she has undeviatingly aspired to follow in the professional footsteps of her mother and father , an endocrinologist and an **25;323;TOOLONG respectively . An accomplished all-round athlete and a serious amateur cellist , she has yet to choose her medical specialty ; at age twelve it was pediatrics , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward a Ph.D . in medicine rather than a straight M.D. ; on the other hand , her strong social conscience urges her toward clinical practice . The book to which she has returned is Medicins sans frontieres , about the international volunteer physicians ' organization thus named , devoted to heroic relief work in Somalia and similarly catastrophized venues ; Gerri hopes to serve in that capacity for a year or two after her residency and before embarking on a career of medical research , private practice , or some combination of the two . Although she has lost her bookmark ( a page that her current , Baltimore boyfriend , a graduate-student apprentice poet at the university 's Homewood campus , obligingly ripped from some postmodernist story collection that he happened to be perusing when Gerri casually asked him , as the pair were reading in bed , for something with which to mark her place while they made love ) , she knows quite well where she is , in the Medicins book and generally . <p> Has she even noticed the oddly dressed young fellow with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she checked in to the resort , at her parents ' urging , for a bit of respite from her workaholism ?

They all know that Derek will outgrow such affectations ; meanwhile , he takes their teasing good-humoredly . <p> That Mexican security guard , the lineaments of whose impassive face are directly descended from those that inspired the Mayan sculptors of dread Chacmool ... <p> That topless young Bolognesa , a stewardess for Alitalia who aspires to be a travel agent in Rome , or perhaps in Milan ... <p> The embryo , its existence unknown to both of its parents , busily and quietly multiplying its cells in Barbara Ellison 's uterus <p> Gerri Fraser 's ex-lover back in Palo Alto , whose ball cap she keeps as a souvenir of that pleasant life episode , although she has switched allegiance to the Orioles and to her new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Franco the senior art historian , just now masturbating pensively before the draperied window of his condominium overlooking the university 's lacrosse field , where the women 's varsity squad is working out .

That balled-up book page on the Club Med beach , slowly unballing itself now by the force of its own resiliency , like a time-lapse movie of a sprouting mushroom , until another breeze catches it and rolls it lightly seaward . <p> Rwanda , Haiti , Bosnia , Kurdistan . The doomed Marsh Arabs . <p> The web of the world . <p>
