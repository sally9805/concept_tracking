Prologue // The Voices // A letter to Margaret Sanger : // Englishtown , N.J. // January 5 , 1925 // Dear Mrs. Sanger // I received your pamplet on family limitation .... I am 30 years old have been married 14 years and have 11 children the oldest 13 and the youngest one year . I have kidney and heart disease , and every one of my children is defictived and we are very poor . Now Mrs. Sanger can you please help me . I have miss a few weeks and I do nt know how to bring myself around . I am so worred and I have cryed my self sick and if I do nt come around I know I will go like my poor sister she went insane and died . My Doctor said I will surely go insane if I keep this up but I cant help it and the doctor wont do anything for me . Oh Mrs. Sanger if I could tell you all the terrible things that I have been through with my babys and children you would know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Please help me just this once and I will be all right . Oh please I beg you . Please no one will ever know and I will be so happy and I will do anything in this world for you and your good work . Please please just this time . Doctors are men and have not had a baby so they have no pitty for a poor sick Mother . You are a Mother and you know so please pitty me and help me . Please Please . Sincerly yours // J.M. // p.s . Please tell me how to get the pessary rubber womb cap . Not even the Doctors here know about them that is what thay tell me. // Chapter One // The Conception // Victory has a hundred fathers , // but defeat is an orphan . //  --  Count Galeazzo Ciano , diary , September 9 , 1942 // At a neighborhood supermarket in the university town where I live , now and then I see a man shuffling through the checkout line , smallish , bald , stooped with age but spry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ item or two , scarcely enough for a single meal . His dark brown suit jacket does n't match his darker pants , and a pair of solemn eyes dart this way and that , stirred by some restless hunger . I wonder , looking around the huge store , if a single shopper among the young collegians and profs and townies has any sense of how this almost invisible ninety-two-year-old has touched their lives intimately and has helped redirect moral beliefs and sexual practices in most of the nations of the world . Since Russell E. Marker lives alone and avoids cultivation of friends , remarkably few townsfolk know who he is or what he has done . At the mention of his name , those who know something of him are likely to look distantly into their memories and say , " Marker . Is n't he the one they call the Father of the Pill ? " // Indeed many do , but they are not quite right . Fifty summers ago , Marker , a chemist who never earned a Ph.D . and whose name is scarcely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creaky overnight bus to where a small bridge spanned a lethargic river in a tropical wilderness of Mexico . From that desiccated soil he dug out cartloads of stinking thick roots and hauled them away until he had piled fifty tons of the grimy brush behind a potter 's shed he had rented to use as a crude lab . Then , during weeks of sweltering , lonely drudgery , Marker extracted from those roots a syrupy potion . That substance led , along a roundabout path , to one of the life-changing inventions of the century . Without his discovery and his toil , the birth control pill as we know it could not have been created . // Russell Marker did not invent the Pill . He has repeatedly tried to make that clear , but his denial refuses to take root among people who talk of him . Again and again he has said that prevention of pregnancy as a goal never crossed his mind . His quest was simpler : a low-cost elixir in a new family of medicines called steroids . As in many of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of creating anything like a social revolution , discovered something on a path to something else , which provided someone else with a clue to something else , each goal along the way smaller , far less ambitious than the final breakthrough . // Nor did a pill to prevent pregnancy enter the thoughts of another ambitious scientist , young Carl Djerassi , who soon deciphered a puzzle that became the next essential step on the way to chemical birth control . But although some loosely label him too the " Father of the Pill , " Djerassi , like Marker , has said again and again that he did not dream of contraception as a goal of his work . // Nor did it occur to one Frank B. Colton of a Chicago drug company who solved the same puzzle as Djerassi in an almost identical way at the almost identical time . // * * * // The contraceptive pill was born unplanned  --  at least by the scientists most widely named as its parents  --  and it has lived a life full of surprise . Of many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more remarkable than any other : To identify this extraordinary drug among all the thousands of potions , powders , capsules , caplets , tablets , and nostrums for sale at any pharmacy anywhere , all you need to do is spell the word pill with a capital P . // Over the past thirty years , the Pill has been swallowed as a daily routine by more humans than perhaps any other prescribed medication in the world . Its takers have counted in the scores of millions , and they have now downed the Pill by the hundreds of billions . Yet its eager consumers are , in general , quite well . Most take it neither to cure an illness nor to guard against one . The Pill has been called " the first medicine ever destined for a purely social , rather than a therapeutic , purpose . " // The short , paradoxical , twist-and-turn history of the Pill is never more elusive and fickle than when we try to answer the most ironic question of its existence : Who brought the thing into the world ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first decade of the Pill 's life , the surest answers were sounded by voices of religion : The Pill was conceived by the devil to sow wickedness . // By its second decade , the Pill , having become swiftly and hugely profitable , broke out with a marked rash of medical side effects , inviting a new explanation of its existence : The Pill was a plot authored by greedy drug companies with the compliance of submissive doctors . That reading , however , does not sit well with a retrospective look at the facts . When drug companies were first presented with the prospect of a contraceptive pill , scarcely without exception they could n't run from it fast enough . Furthermore , the men who ran those drug houses ( yes , virtually all men ) could not believe that many women would choose to swallow chemicals to prevent babies . But one company , then another , did dare market the Pill , and they were soon happy to discover how to reduce its active chemicals so that earlier side effects largely disappeared . // And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aroused perhaps the most surprising resistance of all . Many daughters of the post-1960 women 's revolution , which is almost exactly as old as the Pill itself , began demanding to know why it must be the woman who is called upon to swallow exotic concoctions and take medical risks . Those wonderful men of science who so ardently committed themselves to seeking a chemical " liberation " of women , why have they not troubled themselves to invent a pill for men ? // Good questions , not yet satisfactorily answered , but they too harbor a factually incorrect assumption . The vision of a contraceptive pill was not men 's in general or any individual man 's , although at least five men of science have been publicly designated " the Father of the Pill . " // Even the " father " who could stake the strongest claim of deliberate paternity , a man named Gregory Pincus , did n't think of inventing a birth control pill until the arresting scheme was proposed to him by two women who had a clear vision of exactly what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plunked down hard cash for producing it . // Those two women " stand by themselves as the indisputable mothers of the pill , " in the words of Loretta McLaughlin , the biographer of a fifth frequently named " father , " Harvard gynecologist John Rock . " From the moment they came on stage in the saga of its development , they took command of the scene . They did no less than commission the eminent male scientists who were to be the principals in its emergence , to make or find them an oral contraceptive . The women made it plain that what they wanted was a pill  --  like an aspirin  --  that would be cheap , plentiful , and easy to use . Moreover , the women virtually directed the men to be quick about it . " // Of those two women , one had devoted a long life to transforming her personal cause into a public crusade ; the other cherished and guarded her obscurity . // Margaret Sanger at the age of thirty-four coined a radical and inflammatory expression  --  birth control  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1950 , after turning seventy-one , Sanger , still in full battle dress , joined forces with seventy-five-year-old Katharine McCormick , and together they set out to enlist science in their bold quest for a contraceptive that could be swallowed . Within a decade after commissioning that minute technology , it was physically produced , field-tested for effectiveness and safety , and approved by government . Thereafter it changed how human beings behave . // Millions today embrace the Pill as a salvation , while other millions shun it as sinful or a time bomb of dormant cancers . As a new century approaches , the tiny Pill persists in driving wedges between major religions , schools of medical opinion , factions of feminists . The Pill has brought the Roman Catholic Church into its most threatening confrontation with science since Galileo and its hierarchy into its most embarrassing defeat . Many attribute to the Pill more than to anything else the sexual revolution of the 1960s , although that judgment is far from secure . Perhaps more than any other influence , the Pill helped prepare the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have surrounded abortion , battles that clearly will continue to flare for many years . // As it was intended to do , the Pill has disconnected fear of pregnancy from the pursuit of sexual pleasure . But , intended or not , it has done far more . The Pill has led each of us , women and men alike and in a most personal sense , into a new era of potential mastery over our bodies and ourselves . As the first systemic contraceptive , it altered the routine functioning of the healthy human body . It opened the gateway to what I shall call the Era of BioIntervention , which is already taking us beyond reregulation of the human reproductive system . It is taking us beyond medicine into an eventual ability to modify  --  genetically  --  other body functions as well as our physical form itself . Perhaps the story of science 's accomplishment in creating the Pill , and of some of its social repercussions , may help us better understand the ramifications of what we are poised on the rim of being able to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby from a mother who provides the womb while another furnishes the egg . We rapidly progress toward dispensing with fathers  --  seeming to need only their sperm deposited in plastic vials . Now that we can ascertain the sex of a baby before its birth , how far ahead lies the advance choice of its sex ? Will humans want to  --  and be able to  --  resist that gift of science ? And how soon will our new ability to splice and rearrange our genes  --  in a sense , the reinvention of ourselves as a species  --  offer us exotic choices , thus inviting social , religious , and ethical trials , conflicts , and crises that we can not yet comprehend ? // The moment of conception of the Pill is most often pinpointed as early 1951 at a dinner in New York arranged by Margaret Sanger . Her guests were an ally in the birth control movement since the 1920s , gynecologist Abraham Stone , and Dr. Gregory Pincus of Shrewsbury , Massachusetts , a research scientist of minor notoriety . Pincus , the world 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mammalian egg , had once managed the fertilization in a test tube of the eggs of a rabbit , and the eggs started dividing as they would in a uterus . His friends called the process " Pincogenesis . " No one succeeded in reproducing the experiment independently , a standard requirement for proof of a claim in science . ( Pincus acquired even more sinister fame  --  as " America 's Count Frankenstein "  --  when a typographical error in a newspaper report of the rabbit experiment omitted a vital word : " Dr. Pincus said emphatically that he is not planning to carry it on to find out whether human babies can be made by test tube methods . " ) Pincus had since started and now directed a small , struggling , private research laboratory grandly titled the Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology . // In the common way of history , nobody at the dinner was fully aware of the importance of what they were doing . Nobody connected with the event noted it in a journal or diary or transmitted word of it in any known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the fateful meeting took place , although there is general agreement among those who have tried to track it down that it was in January or February . Nor does anyone know just where it was . Previous writings have placed the meeting in Margaret Sanger 's New York apartment . The problem with that is that in 1951 she had no New York apartment . Perhaps it was at the Waldorf-Astoria , where Sanger usually stayed when she visited New York from her home in Tucson , Arizona , or perhaps at the Carlyle Hotel , where she sometimes occupied an apartment kept by her son 's wealthy mother-in-law . // The meeting , wherever it was , seems to have been spurred by a letter Sanger had received a few weeks earlier from Katharine McCormick , the daughter-in-law of Cyrus McCormick , inventor of the mechanical reaper . Mrs. McCormick was , in the words of the Harvard gynecologist John Rock , " as rich as Croesus . She had a vast fortune . Her lawyer told me she could n't even spend the interest on her interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built hospitals . And she was hepped on birth control . So , inevitably , Mrs. Sanger got in touch with her . " // Actually , it was McCormick who got in touch with Sanger . Their paths had crossed casually over the years , but in October 1950 McCormick wrote earnestly to Sanger to address " two questions that are much with me these days : A ) Where you think the greatest need of financial support is today for the National Birth Control Movement , and B ) What the present prospects are for further birth control research , and by research I mean contraceptive research . " // No dawdler , Sanger fired back a reply that might disconcert a good many who revere her : " I consider that the world and almost our civilization for the next twenty-five years , is going to depend upon a simple , cheap , safe contraceptive to be used in poverty stricken slums , jungles and among the most ignorant people . I believe that now , immediately there should be national sterilization for certain dysgenic types of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out were the government not feeding them . " // Sanger suggested a start-up research fund of twenty-five thousand dollars " definitely to be applied for contraceptive control . " She said it should be divided among five or six universities " in this country , in England or in Germany . " ( Germany so soon after World War II ? Because of that country 's experience in sterilizing undesirables ? Sanger would soon be persuaded to drop sterilization of " dysgenic types " from her pronouncements. ) // In conversation with her dinner guests , Sanger chose her moment to look directly at Pincus and pose the question of the evening : What would it take to enlist science in finding the perfect answer to contraception ? // His reply , while forever unrecorded , clearly encouraged her . Before long , Sanger and her friend Katharine McCormick were visiting Pincus in his laboratory in a redbrick box of a building on a winding , tree-shaded avenue of Shrewsbury , a suburb of Worcester . // They made a contrasting trio . Pincus 's dense bush of graying hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the menacing scientist 's , played against his gentle and observant look of sympathy , a private brooding that bespoke his Russian-Jewish forebears . Except for those luminous dark eyes , he wore a remote , almost haughty air . Pincus was described by a young French scientist who met the famous endocrinologist during a Paris conference , ? tienne- ? mile Baulieu , who would one day develop an abortion pill called RU 486 , recalls : " We all crowded into the hall for a look .... Pincus merely nodded his Einsteinian head . His thick , bushy eyebrows bunched in a frown . He was not tall , but he stood ramrod straight , hardly noticing anyone around him . After a few perfunctory handshakes , he was gone . // Had Pincus not already met Sanger and McCormick separately , he might easily have mistaken one for the other , as a colleague did , taking the one who stood almost six feet tall with the military shoulders , swooping-brim hat , and ankle-length matron 's skirt to be Sanger , the embattled lifelong radical . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothing had frozen almost a half-century earlier , in 1904 , the year she had married . Pincus was aware that at about the time of that marriage she had become one of the first women to earn a degree in biology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , although she never used her training professionally . Standing beside her , the visitor with the elegance and restrained aura of wealth was the one who had molded herself from poverty , indeed from shame . Margaret Sanger was slight , scarcely five feet tall , with a striking crown of auburn hair that permitted confessions of gray , a cautious gaze through wide-apart gray eyes , and a subdued voice that drew her audience close . " But woe be to him , " once warned Mabel Dodge , an early birth control ally and hostess of a famous New York salon , " who was misled by this calm exterior into ignoring the tremendous fighting spirit , the self-generating energy and the relentless drive that lay beneath it . " // Could Pincus and his coworkers , the women asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical barrier between sperm and ovum  --  that would be safe and be available soon ? // What , Pincus inquired , did they mean by soon ? // One sees McCormick deferring to Sanger : The next few years . // Pincus hedged : Yes , probably , he could do it , but nobody could guarantee it . // Could he come close to guaranteeing it if he were assured of adequate money for laboratory staff , for supplies , for gathering and reinvestigating every scrap of relevant information from the scientific literature ? // Known for his file-cabinet mind and index-card memory  --  and by his coworkers for reading mystery novels at the rate of almost one a night  --  Pincus silently riffled through possibilities , then speculated aloud that the perfect answer to Sanger 's " perfect " contraceptive probably lay in clever use of a hormone . The trouble was , he knew some of the formidable obstacles blocking that path to the perfect . If it was intended to be used by many women , where was a large supply of the hormone to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could afford ? And how was a woman to take it ? // That , pressed Sanger , was what she was hoping Pincus might become interested in finding out . // Mrs. McCormick unabashedly pointed out that she was prepared to pay for finding it out  --  soon . // The suggestion had a tantalizing providential undertone . In 1951 Pincus 's most absorbing mission was to keep his Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology financially afloat . // That was a very severe word , guarantee , Pincus responded . But yes , he thought so . // Would he commit himself and his foundation to it if he got the money ? // Pincus replied : Yes , he would . // Then a barrage of discomforting questions : What would it cost ? When would he get started ? When would he deliver ? // Science , resisted Pincus , does not work that way . // Mrs. McCormick 's life had taught her that most human undertakings do work that way . She pressed for an estimate . // According to a recollection years later by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the top of my head , I 'd say one hundred twenty-five thousand dollars to start . " // Mrs. McCormick drew a checkbook from her purse . Writing a draft for forty thousand dollars , she explained , " This is the end of the fiscal year . I 'll talk to my financial man , and you 'll get the rest . " // He did , and before many years , Mrs. McCormick 's investment expanded to two million dollars .
