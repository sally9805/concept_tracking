" FOR THREE YEARS , I 've had a feeling that if Chuck had n't been on that plane , it would n't have been bombed , " says Beulah McKee , 75 . Her bitterness has still not subsided . But seated in the parlor of her house in Trafford , Pennsylvania , the house where her son was born 43 years ago , she struggles to speak serenely . " I know that 's not what our President wants me to say , " she admits . <P> George Bush 's letter of condolence , written almost four months after the shattered remains of Pan Am Flight 103 fell on Lockerbie , Scotland , on Dec. 21 , 1988 , expressed the usual " my heart goes out to you " sorrow . " No action by this government can restore the loss you have suffered , " he concluded . But deep inside , Mrs. McKee suspects it was a government action gone horribly awry that indirectly led to her only son 's death . " I 've never been satisfied at ( all by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . <P> Today , as the U.S. spearheads the U.N.-sanctioned embargo against Libya for not handing over two suspects in the bombing , Mrs. McKee wonders if Chuck 's background contains the secret of why this plane was targeted . If her suspicions are correct , Washington may not be telling the entire story . Major Charles Dennis McKee , called " Tiny " by his Army intelligence friends , was a burly giant and a superstar in just about every kind of commando training offered to American military personnel . He completed the rugged Airborne and Ranger schools , graduated first in his class from the Special Forces qualification course , and served with the Green Berets . In Beirut he was identified merely as a military attache assigned to the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) . But his hulking physique did n't fit such a low- profile diplomatic post . Friends there remember him as a " walking arsenal " of guns and knives . His real assignment reportedly was to work with the CIA in reconnoitering the American hostages in Lebanon and then , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . <P> McKee 's thick , 37-page Army dossier contains so many blacked-out words that it 's hard to glean the danger he faced . Surviving the censor 's ink was his title , " Team Chief . " Under " Evaluation , " it was written that he " performs constantly in the highest-stress environment with clear operational judgment and demeanor . . . Especially strong in accomplishing the mission with minimal guidance and supervision . . . Continues to perform one of the most hazardous and demanding jobs in the Army . " <P> For Beulah McKee the mystery deepened six months after Chuck 's death , when she received a letter from another U.S. agent in Beirut . It was signed " John Carpenter , " a name the Pentagon says it ca n't further identify . Although the letter claimed that Chuck 's presence on the Pan Am plane was unrelated to the bombing , Carpenter 's message only stirred her suspicions . " I can not comment on Chuck 's work , " he wrote , " because his work lives on . God willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will learn the true story of his heroism and courage . "
