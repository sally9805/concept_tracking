In a small classroom on the MIT Sloan School of Management campus in Cambridge , Mass. , about 15 graduate business school students gather for a workshop on job interviews . The lesson is like any other for a group of job seekers , but the attendees look nothing like what you might expect . They all are women . Business schools have traditionally been white and male . Even today , women represent only about 30 percent of M.B.A . enrollment . Blacks , Hispanics , and American Indians make up fewer than 10 percent of students in the top 30 business schools , while they are about 28 percent of the U.S. population . But business schools are working hard to make their classrooms reflect the real world . Companies " are trying to build the most diverse workforce , " says Elissa Ellis-Sangster , executive director of the Fort Foundation , a collaboration of major corporations , top business schools , and the Graduate Management Admission Council . Schools have followed suit , reaching out to potential students who may never have before considered an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and racial imbalance present themselves early in the application process . Simply put , women and underrepresented minorities do not apply in the numbers their counterparts do . As a result , diversity and parity efforts rely heavily on outreach . In 2001 , the Fort Foundation was formed to address the lack of progress toward gender equity in business schools . Law and medical schools were quickly approaching parity , but business programs remained disproportionately male . Admissions officers were losing smart women not to competitor schools but to other disciplines . Since then , Fort and its member schools have talked to thousands of women to explain the value of the M.B.A . " We market not just the schools , " says " Fort holds conferences in big cities to answer questions about financing , work-life balance , career opportunities , and the commitment necessary to earn an M.B.A . Women also have benefited from a decade-old admissions trend at business schools : increasingly younger students . In the mid-90s , enrollees averaged about seven years of work experience , but that number is falling . By seeking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college , graduate programs can recruit more women when they are more open to a significant life change . Tackling the dearth of minorities may seem similar to the battle to reach gender parity , but the challenges are vastly different . Black women are relatively well represented in business schools , says Barbara Thomas , president and CEO of the National Black MBA Association . But , much like in the rest of academia , black men are often left behind . Part of the solution is to recruit young . The National Black MBA Association has begun outreach efforts in high school . Thomas would start even younger . High school is " really not early enough , " she says . " After the age of 9 , if you have not gotten into the mind of the child , you probably have lost them . " The National Society of Hispanic MBAs and American Indian Business Leaders offer resources and opportunities for their members . There is also the Consortium for Graduate Study in Management , a corporate and academic alliance dedicated to advancing underrepresented minorities in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ application , and hosts a special first-year orientation . Meanwhile , individual schools have taken matters into their own hands , banding together to recruit from historically black colleges or hosting elaborate " diversity day " events to welcome new or potential students . Lastly , there are two selling points that speak clearly to both women and minorities : money and flexibility . Schools have found that recruiting women and minorities means being prepared to answer more questions about tuition , housing , and loans . In addition , many programs have expanded their part-time and online offerings . The efforts of these schools have not gone unrewarded . Last year , first-year enrollment at New York University 's Stern School of Business was 41 percent female , and MIT has seen its class go from 28 percent female in 2000 to 35 percent just eight years later . The number of local chapters of the National Black MBA Association grew more than 50 percent in five years , and , according to Thomas , the late 1990s were a time of " drastic changes " in the social fabric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a historic presidential election , another round of drastic changes does n't sound so improbable . **** Smart Choices You asked for flexibility and accessibility , and you got both . The number of part-time programs ( evenings and weekends ) has expanded ; so have opportunities in distance learning and executive M.B.A . ' s . Ca n't afford to take two years without a paycheck ? These flexible programs may be the solution . Insider Tip Your coursework is important , but B-school is all about networking . Make connections , and do n't hesitate to join clubs or sports teams . Schools cater to almost every group and interest ( check out Berkeley ' s Rugby Club , Texas ' s Entrepreneur Society , or Northwestern ' s Chinese Business Club ) . Freestyle motocross not available ? Use that entrepreneurial spirit to start an organization yourself . Getting In Essays . Admissions officers are obsessed with " fit . " They want you to match well with their community . Your essays are the best opportunity to prove that you belong at a school . Study up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show who you really are -- not who you think the admissions officers want . Recommendations . Pick your recommenders carefully . Someone who knows you well is better than someone with a fancy title . Ask your recommender early , and take the time to sit down and remind him or her of all your accomplishments . Nontraditional . Most M.B.A . candidates come from finance , consulting , and engineering backgrounds . But what if you 're an English major who has spent the past five years working as an actress ? No problem . Business schools eagerly seek out " poets , " or applicants with nontraditional backgrounds . The key is to prove your proficiency with numbers . Nail the quantitative section of the GMAT , and , if you can , take a statistics or business accounting class before you apply . And get an A.
