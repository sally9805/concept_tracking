She received many significant literary prizes , including the Kawabata Yasunari Literary Prize in 1976 , and the Asahi Prize for arts and culture in 1983 . Her " Mizu " ( Water ) , translated here , was first published in the Gunzo magazine in 1962 , and collected in Onna no Yado ( The House of Women , 1963 ) . As a left-wing activist most of her life , she was one of modern Japan 's most remarkable characters , and a genuine pioneer of women 's liberation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very poor working-class family , but started her writing career in Tokyo , where she met several famous authors , including Akutagawa Ryonosuke , who encouraged her to write . She published poetry in the review Roba ( Donkey ) in 1927 . Her first published story was " Kyarameri Kojo kara " ( From a Caramel Factory , 1928 ) , based on personal experience of women 's working conditions . Around this time , she became involved in the Proletarian Literature Movement . In 1932 , she joined the Japan Communist Party , at that time a banned organization , and was imprisoned for two months in 1935 for her political activities . On her release , she wrote an account of her experiences in " Karen " ( Vermilion , 1936 ) . In 1941 and 1942 , she visited Korea , China and Southeast Asia with other writers .

In front of her rose the steel barrier of a train , in which passengers had already taken seats , awaiting departure time . It was just after noon , and a gentle spring sun was shining in the sky , but the narrow space in which she had taken refuge remained plunged in shadow cast by the train . Wearing a green woolen sweater and a gray skirt , she was weeping , her head lowered , clasping tightly her canvas bag that was placed on her knees . She was well aware that from the train window just above her head people were watching her with a curious air , but that did not stop her from sobbing , and there was no other place for her to move to . So she just stayed where she was , continually wiping her eyes with a gauze handkerchief , so that they could see only her hair , whose long since unpermed locks were combed up into a chignon . She was young ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no makeup , one could guess that she had no time to care about her own appearance because of hard labor . Her tears made her look all the more helpless and pitiful . It was indeed a sad sight to see her crouched there on the station platform , sobbing her heart out on that fine spring day .... A crowd of travelers was waiting in dusty disorder for the train that would depart from the other side of the platform . The railway workers , booth , near the end of the platform , stood apart from the throng , but from time to time people passed noisily running in front of Ikuyo , who went on squatting there . The young girl , lost in the agitation all around her , would then clutch her bag in a convulsive grip that betrayed a desire to find some sort of support in her confusion . Resigned as she was to the solitude in which her sorrow confined her among all the surrounding agitation , Ikuyo appeared completely unconscious of any need to seek for help , and , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her heart of hearts by calling upon the memory of her mother . Yesterday morning , she had received a telegram at the inn in Kanda Ogawacho , in Tokyo , where she worked as a kitchen maid . When the telegram had arrived , she was busy washing up the dishes from the breakfast left by a group of 50 or so guests . She read the text : MOTHER DYING . COME HOME AT ONCE , and her face took on a sudden anguished expression in which her pupils seemed to dilate . At once she went to see her employer and told him : " I 've just received this .... " The man first of all gave her a severe , suspicious look , for his habit of keeping a strict eye on his numerous workers had become like second nature to him . But he was forced to acknowledge the truth of the evidence she had given him and to realize that she was not trying to cheat him . Nevertheless , he did not abandon his unfeeling attitude , all the time trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indifference to the misfortunes of others . In this way he made clear his one true worry , which was to have her leave him , at the height of the tourist season , minus a helper . So he said : " You 'd better wait until the next telegram . If your mother is really dying , I do n't see what good it would do if you were to leave for Toyama right now . You 'd never reach there in time ! " " Yes , sir , " she meekly answered before going to continue the work without end that awaited her in the kitchens . It had been in winter , two years ago , when she had left her village in Toyama to come and work at the inn . The owner was from the same district as herself and had taken her into service , providing her with food and lodging . " It 's a pity you have to limp like that ! " he had told her , looking her over from head to foot , with an air of deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ikuyo 's response had been accompanied only by a meek smile . She did in fact have one leg slightly shorter than the other . Indeed , that was the reason why she had been rejected by the local spinning mill where she had hoped to find employment . So she had to consider herself lucky to have found this job , which allowed her to make sufficient money , even just as a simple servant , to send to her mother and at the same time to put by some small savings . Ikuyo put money aside in the hope of later being able to pay for her mother , who looked so old it seemed incredible she could be the same age as the wife of the innkeeper , to enjoy a little break at a hot spring . Ikuyo also remembered that at a time when she was still at school her elder sister , who worked in a spinning mill at a nearby town , had once sent money that allowed their mother to stay at a hot spring . Their mother had gone off , taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When she had returned only four or five days later she had looked so rejuvenated they could hardly recognize her ! She now stood upright , though she had had the habit of keeping her back bent even when she was inside the house . Ikuyo had always known her mother with that bent-double stance , owing less to her age than to the life she had led . But now her mother had returned with rosy cheeks and a clear complexion . After that , her mother would often refer to memories of those few happy days . She would always bring them up in conversation . After the stay in that hot spring she said that her life would be lengthened by three years . She would never forget the play performed by an itinerant troupe , which she had seen for two nights in the big room of the inn where she was staying . Perhaps it was what she was thinking of secretly when she was alone , bent over her needlework . Ikuyo thought so , when she was doing her homework beside her mother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say : " You see , I was able to go to the hot spring thanks to the money sent me by your sister . " Then Ikuyo would promise herself that when she , too , was of an age to go to work , she would put by money from her wages so as to be able to offer her , in her turn , another stay at that hot spring . <p> Ikuyo had been five years old when her father died . Her elder brother was 13 and her sister 10 . As she was the youngest , she still slept with her mother , and in her sleep she sometimes happened to reach out-it had become a habit with her-for her mother 's breast , so warm and soft to the touch . One night , several months after her father 's death , Ikuyo , feeling her mother get into the futon beside her , had put her hand out to touch her breast under her nightwear . Then a sudden gesture of refusal had fully woken her from sleep . She had opened her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another try . " No . No , I tell you ! " The tone was without appeal . Her body shuddering all over , her mother had repulsed her hand with a gesture so brutal that Ikuyo , taken by surprise , had burst into tears . " What are you crying for like that ? " her mother had asked her , in the same angry tone . At any rate , Ikuyo was hardly old enough to understand what a delicate situation her mother was in now . On yet another evening , she was awakened bv a feeling that her mother was crying . " Ma ! " she had called , very softly , and the weeping had stopped . As she had received no answer , her hand had groped through the darkness to touch her mother 's face , and her hand had at once become wet with tears . At that moment , Ikuyo had clearly understood that her mother 's distress was caused by the sufferings she had had to endure since her husband 's passing . But perhaps it was rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future ? In later years , when she became adult , Ikuyo would still often recall that scene ... Ikuyo 's shorter leg inspired in her mother a feeling of pity , and sometimes she even went as far as to ask forgiveness for it , as if she held herself responsible . She would tell how one day-Ikuyo was then two years old-she had carried her in her arms all the way to the hospital in Toyama , for the baby had had a raging fever that had persisted already for several days . " You stayed there a full month , " she told her daughter , " and the doctor told me you were lucky to leave the hospital alive . You should not mind so much that this leg is a little shorter than the other ! " On another occasion , as she was walking home from school through the rice fields , a gang of boys had shouted after her : " Gammy leg ! Gammy leg ! " Her mother , who happened to be passing by , heard what they had shouted and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so embarrassed that she ran away . As she ran , she hobbled painfully along , her left shoulder dropping at each step with the left foot . Ikuyo was certainly not a very lively character , but she had a docile demeanor , and managed her infirmity in such a way that as she labored in the kitchen from morning to night no one noticed her lameness . It seemed as if she had stored up all her courage deep in her heart , and showed it only in the obedience or the vigor she put into her work . Thus she had succeeded , after more than a year of devoted service , in convincing the chef and her boss himself of the seriousness of her work , and she had felt pleased when she was praised , since she had expected that it was quite difficult for her to get along in Tokyo-particularly for her . " That young lass will make an excellent housewife one day ! " said the chef whom she had overheard talking about her with the other maids . Not knowing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued , with knowing smiles , by making remarks about her lame leg with a cruel frankness , despite the scraps of compliments he threw in . Ikuyo had bitten her lips , then her eyes had brimmed with tears . For she could only feel that those words were a sort of violation of the secret place in which she had hidden the painful consciousness of her physical defect . At first , her boss had hired her only out of pure charity , but it had soon become apparent that in doing so he had made an excellent bargain , without having expected such a turn of events . When Ikuyo had begun to cherish , from that time on , the idea that she might be able to bring her mother from the country so as to show her Tokyo , it had in fact been her boss who , in a generous impulse of the moment , had suggested the project and had even offered to lodge her mother . So , when the telegram had arrived , Ikuyo had imagined that she would have no difficulty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her employer would not fail to commiserate with her in her misfortune . But how differently things had turned out .... She had then begun to understand what an unbridgeable distance separated her from him , and when , late that night , she had finally been able to go to bed , she found herself all alone with her sorrow . MOTHER DEAD . ARE YOU COMING HOME ? asked the following telegram , delivered the next morning . Her legs gave way beneath her , and Ikuyo collapsed on the kitchen floor with a faint cry : " Oh , Ma ! " uttered in a breathless , almost strangled voice . Abandoning there and then the work she had started that morning , she had packed , sobbing all the time , her savings book and her personal effects . Then , without awaiting the return of her boss , who had gone to the fish market , she had said goodbye to his wife before hastening off to the station at Ueno . As she was leaving , the wife , giving as an excuse her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going so far as to add : " Well , if your mother 's dead , you know , running away back home wo n't bring her to life again ! " Ikuyo heard those words with an impassive face , revealing nothing of her inner reactions . Clasping her canvas bag , she had left the inn by the kitchen back door , but when she set off along the street she was limping even more markedly than usual . Coming to the full awareness that her mother had died , Ikuyo realized for the first time the depth of the attachment that had bound them together . The death of her mother signified for her the disappearance of the one person in the world with whom she could feel at ease and with whom she was able to forget her infirmity . If indeed , as her mother claimed , Ikuyo 's malformation had been inflicted upon her as a result of actions they had performed in a previous existence , they agreed they must both share the responsibility for the original fault . Ikuyo would also wonder if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mother 's guilt . Knowing only too well the burden of suffering borne daily by her mother , Ikuyo refrained from ever discussing the matter with her . Nonetheless , she was the one person before whom Ikuyo did not have to put on a display of courage-a part she had to perform even before her brother and sister . So now the moment of her mother 's death had arrived . Ikuyo thought how she would have longed to run to her bedside and share her tears . She tried to imagine her lying dead , but still could not envisage her except as someone asleep on her thin cotton futon . No , she could not be anywhere else , thought Ikuyo . Now she felt herself deeply moved by a strong sense of pity for her mother , something she had never experienced until now . " Poor Ma ! " she sighed . It seemed so obvious to her that , whatever happened henceforth , her mother was forever reduced to a state of utter helplessness . Then , as this sense of pity flowed back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wave of sorrow that made all the more unbearable the remorse she felt at having been so weak-willed , the day before , when she took the first telegram to her employer : It gave her the impression that she had , through her surrender , dragged her mother down in her own defeat . Soon she would be all alone , which meant from now on she would be alone bearing the burden of her infirmity . The confusion reigning on the platform , with each person swept away in his own direction , seemed to ignore the presence of Ikuyo , who , for her part , remained indifferent to what was going on around her . She had to wait one more hour before the train she had to take would enter the station . The carriages in front of which she was sitting crouched down were now about to depart . The bell rang out . Ikuyo took her bag and stood up . Complexion almost diaphanous with weeping , her little face had lost all trace of color , and beneath her lowered lids her narrowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she walked in the opposite direction to that taken by the train that was beginning to move off , and her shoulders echoed , in their slow swaying , the movement of her steps . Finally she was giving herself completely to the gaze of the people observing her from the windows of the train . Not far from the railway workers " booth , there was a standpipe from the tap of which water was flowing down . A station employee had come to fill his kettle from it , then , turning about with his full vessel , had set off with hurried steps leaving the tap running . After that , many people had passed by it , but no one had taken the trouble to turn it off . Ikuyo , carrying her own sorrow , approached it . As she had raised her head , the tears overflowing her eyelids made runnels down her cheeks . As she passed by , she turned off the tap , and the water which had noisily been splashing suddenly stopped running . Ikuyo did not seem to have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a purely mechanical way . Meanwhile , the train was gathering rumbling speed , and when the line was left free , the city could be seen . Ikuyo returned to her former place and crouched down again , continuing to sob . Across the space left open by the departed train , the sun of springtime was now shining .
