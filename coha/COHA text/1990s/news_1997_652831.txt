<p> Shoes off , head bowed nearly to the keyboard , David Helfgott winds his way back and forth through the phrases of a Chopin prelude , singing , sighing , making buzzing noises with his mouth , talking to himself . <p> " Keep playing , keep playing , " he murmurs , his eyes half closed . " You 're playing nice now . Gentle . Gentle . La la la la . Just play every note and you 'll be fine . Smile , smile , smile . Image is everything . Image is everything . At least you 're playing well . If you 're playing well , you can survive now , so what 's this fear of the future ? Zhhhhhhh . " <p> Transported by the music , he lifts a free hand to conduct himself and smiles . <p> This is a recording session , and the auditorium of the Joan Sutherland Performing Arts Center is empty , but Mr. Helfgott , 49 , is hardly alone . The darkened seats are populated by his ghosts , and he plays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , referring to his late father , the man whose obsessive love and cruelty were inescapable elements of his upbringing . " Papachka thought it should be different . Well , they like your playing . They like your playing . This is the point , the point , the point , if there is a point . " <p> In recent weeks , Mr. Helfgott 's troubled past has returned in force to transform his life . A biographical movie about him , " Shine , " is a critical hit on Sunday , Geoffrey Rush , who portrays the pianist as an adult , won the Golden Globe Award for best actor , and suddenly Mr. Helfgott is at the center of attention . He seems to love it . <p> He is here in the darkened auditorium , recording tracks for a second compact disk of his music , and as soon as he stops playing , he is surrounded by his manager , his piano coach , his wife and a television crew that is preparing a report in advance of an American tour beginning in March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains in motion , shuffling rapidly from one person to another like a fly bouncing from one lighted windowpane to another , hugging , kissing , chattering as he goes . <p> " Awesome , awesome , America is awesome , " he murmurs . " You 'll be fine . You 'll be fine . The worry 's the killer ; the worry 's the big killer , is n't it . O. J. 's a killer . Do n't worry . Do n't worry . " <p> Mr. Helfgott 's wife and protector , Gillian , called his new popularity " a victory over the past " and said it seemed to have lifted some of the burden of pain from his shoulders . <p> " Genius and madness , " she said , describing a theme of the movie and of her husband 's life . " Someone once called David a genius and he replied , ' Yes , but it does n't come cheaply . ' " <p> " Shine , " directed by Scott Hicks and released by Fine Line , has been embraced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obsession and the crushing of a psyche . As a result , Mr. Helfgott 's concerts in Australia have become sellouts , and a recording of his music has climbed high on both classical and pop music charts in the United States and Britain . <p> He will soon embark on a 10-month tour of the United States , Canada , Europe and Asia . His schedule is still being completed , but he has concerts set for Symphony Hall in Boston on March 4 , Avery Fisher Hall in New York on March 18 and the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles on March 25 and 27 . When tickets to Mr. Helfgott 's first New York concert sold out in three days , he added a second concert at Avery Fisher on April 8 . <p> The film is a remarkably faithful recounting of Mr. Helfgott 's life : his childhood of musical accomplishment and parental torment ; his decade in mental institutions , away from music , and his halting return to the piano , first in a wine bar in his hometown of Perth , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Helfgott by Mr. Rush , an Australian actor who is also a pianist  --  and who spent just five days with him  --  is uncannily accurate , with all its hyperkinetic warmth and self-aware humor . <p> " It 's the greatest movie ever made , " Mr. Helfgott exclaimed , delighted with the portrayal . <p> The crucial trauma of Mr. Helfgott 's youth seems to have occurred when his father , Peter , blocked an invitation from the violinist Isaac Stern for the boy to study music in the United States . When the teen-age David did leave at last to study at the Royal College of Music in London , his father disowned him . <p> Months later , after a successful performance of his father 's favorite piece , the demanding Piano Concerto No. 3 by Rachmaninoff , Mr. Helfgott suffered a mental breakdown that sent him into institutions . Doctors gave him electroshock therapy and for years forbade him to play the piano . <p> Mrs. Helfgott said she had a tape of her husband playing when he first returned to the instrument . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . <p> At the piano for the recording session , Mr. Helfgott dipped gingerly into that sadness , touching on it quickly and skittering away as he practiced , over and over again , Chopin 's " Raindrop " prelude . <p> " I 'm lucky to be alive , lucky to be alive , " he said as his fingers moved over the keyboard . " I 've been through hell , been through hell , keep smiling , keep smiling , keep smiling . You have to remember I came from hell , I 'm going to heaven . Dad 's in heaven , but he 's proud . " <p> What was his father like ? <p> " Well , my daddy was different from any other man in the world , " Mr. Helfgott said . " Dad ca n't help it , Dad ca n't help it . He was demanding , but the point was , keep to the point , keep to the point , I should say that Dad was very demanding and cruel , cruel , cruel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Mr. Helfgott begins to come to terms with the memory of his father and settles into a loving relationship with his wife , an astrologer 15 years his senior . Just as improbably , this story has another happy sequel , as he seems to be thriving on the publicity and fascination with his life that the film has produced . <p> In her book about their relationship , " Love You to Bits and Pieces , " now being released by Penguin in the United States , Mrs. Helfgott describes her husband 's life in what he calls the " heaven " of their rural home in Promised Land , two hours northwest of Sydney , where she said he plays the piano at least six hours a day . <p> His pleasures away from the piano include swimming in their large pool , and traffic jams , which , to the amusement of his wife and friends , he adores . <p> " I love traffic , I love traffic , " he said the other day as Mrs. Helfgott drove him to the recording session in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very important , and it should n't be ignored , " he said . " You have to be alert because there 's a pattern in the traffic and it helps you to concentrate and to relax . It 's very important to enjoy the journey . " <p> Mr. Helfgott remains on a medication called Seranace for a psychological disorder that doctors have found difficult to name . " He is not schizophrenic or manic-depressive , " Mrs. Helfgott said . " He is never depressed . He 's just a delightful eccentric . " <p> She said his dosage had been kept deliberately low to avoid muffling his creativity . " If we gave him more , he could be easier to live with in certain ways , but you could turn him into a ghost of himself . " <p> To polish his playing and help keep him focused at the piano , Mr. Helfgott now meets regularly with a piano coach , Mikhail Solovei , who heads the department of piano at the Melba Conservatorium in Melbourne and lectures on piano at Monash University . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Mr. Solovei , who spent years as a concert pianist in Russia . " After the movie , everyone wants to hear him , everyone wants to see him . It 's something enormous . " <p> The intimate mood of the movie seems to have created a sense of personal involvement in his audiences , Mrs. Helfgott said . <p> " Some people like to sit in the front row , and if they can catch some of what he says , they get quite excited , " she said . " They feel as if they are sharing his inner thoughts , which of course they are . " <p> One listener recalled with delight a concert at which Mr. Helfgott paused briefly as he played , muttered , " Here comes a hard part , " and plunged ahead . <p> For all his obvious pain and fragility , it is another rare quality that draws people to him : his childlike warmth and affection . <p> " Sometimes you want to eat him , he 's so cuddly , " Mrs. Helfgott said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Mr. Solovei agreed . " He is absolutely lovable , though very fragile , that 's true , " the teacher said . " His problem is that he reacts to everything , whatever he sees , whatever he feels . He has to hug everyone . He has to comment on everything . Sometimes he likes to hug the piano and kiss the piano . " <p> He added : " I would say he is a happy character . Maybe not all the way down : maybe some way down is the tragedy . Sometimes for no reason , sometimes he can start crying . But it goes away very quickly . The happiness is not a fake . He really has this very charming personality . " <p> At the piano , Mr. Helfgott 's efforts at concentration are palpable and , sitting forward in their seats , his audiences join him in his struggle to stay focused . <p> " He mostly hears what he wants to hear , not always what is there , " Mr. Solovei said . " His playing is mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs a little more control so that he produces what he is hearing in his head . " <p> Or , as Mrs. Helfgott puts it : " Sometimes you 've got to be a bit firm with him . Otherwise he just mucks about . " <p> Mr. Helfgott and Mr. Solovei are sitting side by side on the piano bench preparing for the final piece in today 's recording session , Liszt 's Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2 . Mr. Helfgott has one arm around his teacher , and he is leaning his head on Mr. Solovei 's shoulder . <p> " Remember to pedal , David ; do n't be lazy , " the teacher says . " See ? Pedal and pedal . Two in a row . " <p> " I 'll try , I 'll try , " Mr. Helfgott says . " Pedal , pedal . I love pedal . " He begins to play , buzzing to himself . <p> " David , David , do n't fake the left hand ! Play ! " Mr. Solovei urges . <p> " Ksss , ksss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David , " Mr. Solovei says . " Pedal . " <p> " Ksss , ksss , ksss . " <p> " Enjoy it more , " Mr. Solovei cries as the music takes flight . " Smile ! Smile ! " <p> " Must be aware , got to be aware , " Mr. Helfgott says , well into the music now . " I know why . Just smile , just smile . Never mind , never mind . I 'm pretty good sometimes . I 'm pretty good sometimes . I 'll play it if it kills me . Just keep smiling , just keep smiling . Better keep playing . Better keep playing . "
