<p> PHILADELPHIA - He was just a boy of 5 , and so his request shocked and alarmed his mother . <p> " He wanted to see and touch her breasts , " says Elizabeth H. Dermond , 37 , recalling an incident involving a friend and the friend 's young son . " Her first question was , ' Do you think there is something going on in his preschool program ? ' That 's how much paranoia there is about children and sex . " <p> Dermond , a registered nurse , and the widowed mother of sons , 8 and 12 , reassured her friend that the child 's interest was probably healthy , and not , as the distraught mother feared , an indication that the boy had been sexually abused . A recent study , the largest of its kind to examine normal sexual behaviors in young children , seems to support Dermond 's conclusion . <p> The findings of the three-year study of 1,000 ethnically diverse children , ages 2 to 12 , corroborate the results of several earlier surveys that young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the younger the child , the more prevalent the behavior . <p> The study also offers validation to many parents who have observed their children engaged in exhibitionism , self-stimulation , bedroom peeking and attempts to touch or view the private parts of adults , and concluded that there was nothing unusual or unhealthy about such activities . <p> " I tended to think it was very logical , " said Dermond , whose late husband was a doctor . " Children comparing ( genitals ) does n't concern me , because I think they see it the way they see comparing height . Their interest in breasts is very normal , too , because children do n't have breasts and tend to be curious about anything alien to them . " <p> Dermond said she would be troubled by any behavior in children that was clearly inappropriate for their age , that seemed to " mimic adult sexual activity " or that lacked innate innocence . And her concerns would be justified , said William N. Friedrich , a child psychologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester , Minn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who conducted the new study , published in the April issue of the journal Pediatrics , said extreme sexual precociousness is still one of the best indicators that a child has been abused . But he said parents should learn to know the difference between conduct that reflects a troubled psyche and behavior that indicates typical , early childhood development . <p> " A 5-year-old who touches himself while he watches a favorite TV show and is sitting in his favorite chair is making an association between pleasurable feelings . That 's normal , " said Friedrich . " An 11-year-old who touches himself on the school bus or in other inappropriate settings , and he does n't care who sees him , that 's an indication of a problem . " <p> Friedrich said the results of his current study , which involved interviews with mothers of young children from Minnesota and California , back up conclusions reached in a survey he conducted five years ago and seem to agree with early psychological research dating to Sigmund Freud , who theorized that sexual fantasy in early childhood is crucial to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems conclusive that very young children , those under 5 , tend to see sexual behavior as just another form of exploratory stimulation . The behavior declines dramatically after age 5 , when children enter what Freud described as a " latency period , " a time of intense intellectual and emotional development leading up to resurgent sexual feelings at age 11 for girls and age 12 for boys . <p> The new research attempted to pin down normal sexual behaviors by screening out subjects who might have been sexually abused and by examining a larger , more diverse population , said Friedrich . Of the mothers surveyed , 30 percent were non-white and 25 percent were economically disadvantaged , the researcher said . <p> Regardless of their race , ethnicity or socioeconomic backgrounds , all parents are prone to profound , sometimes irrational fears about their children 's sexual development , said Norma Lefkowitz , a psychologist , therapist and director of the Family Therapy Center of the Family Institute of Philadelphia . <p> " A lot of parents , " she said , " have no idea what normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often panic at the first sign of sexual behavior , said Lefkowitz , who advises parents to read up on child development and seek counseling from a pediatrician or psychotherapist if they remain confused about their child 's behavior , or if they suspect abuse . Parents should also talk to each other , share a mutual understanding about what kind of behaviors they might see in their children , and reach agreement about how they will react or not react . <p> " Play-act it , " Lefkowitz said , " with one adult as the child and the other as the parent . Then reverse it . It 's very important that parents be very comfortable about the behavior . " <p> And very important , too , that anyone responsible for caring for the child outside the home be aware of how her parents deal with her sexual behavior , said Lefkowitz . <p> " Kids know there are different rules at different places , " Lefkowitz , said . " But if a caregiver says to your child , ' You ca n't let anybody see your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell them what you do at home and how you would like them to react . " <p> Every home is different , and how parents view sexual behavior by their young children invariably reflects their own values , said James Coplan , medical director for outpatient services at the Children 's Seashore House at Children 's Hospital of Philadelphia . <p> Coplan said the current debate over co-sleeping - allowing children to share their parents ' bed - exemplifies the complex and highly varied emotional and intellectual responses that intimate behavior among the very young evokes in adults . <p> Coplan said parents who are worried about the potential impact of co-sleeping or any other close personal contact with their children must learn to avoid seeing a child 's need for physical intimacy as a manifestation of adult-style sexuality . <p> " Take a deep breath , look at your own reactions , and then put the kid 's behavior in context , " Coplan said . " You have to take it out in the light of day . Were there any taboo thoughts that their behavior excited in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper context and understand why the kid 's behavior disturbs them . " <p> Adults may be put off , confused or frightened by child sexual activity , but the children themselves know better , said Lefkowitz , noting that " until we ( adults ) label something as bad , children are innocent . Kids like their backs scratched , they like their hair played with , because it feels good . Well , their erogenous zones have even more nerve endings , and so why would n't they get good feelings from those areas ? " <p> Apparently , American parents are n't the only ones perplexed by child sexual development . <p> In the new film Ma Vie en Rose ( " My Life in Pink " ) , French director Alain Berliner - in his heartfelt and unusual story about a little girl growing up in the body of a boy - underscores the shame and distaste that many adults feel toward the sexual awakening of children . The child 's feelings , including his attraction to his male classmate , seem natural and entirely normal - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Ronald and Roseanne Clark are the parents of five children ranging in age from 6 months to 8 years . The Haddonfield , N.J. , couple have n't seen much sexual behavior from their four daughters and one son , but agreed years ago not to overreact if they ever did . Their reason ? They did n't want their children to develop an exaggerated view of the importance of sex . <p> " We do n't make a big thing out of it , so they wo n't make a big thing out of it when they 're older , " said Ronald Clark , 41 , an orthodontist . <p> Clark said that when his daughters were younger they routinely saw their mother naked in the bathroom and that he has no objections to his 2-year-old son seeing him nude . But he has avoided letting any of the girls , even the youngest ones , see him undressed , and he said that " once they reach 8 or 10 none of the kids needs to be seeing the opposite sex naked . " <p> At Beth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son and daughter " ran around naked all the time " when they were toddlers . They are young adults now and a bit embarrassed about their earlier behavior , but their mother took it in stride , even when the kids ' conduct made some adults uncomfortable . <p> " My daughter used to like to run around with no top on , " said Jones , 44 . " I had a neighbor tell me that little girls do n't wear one-piece bathing suits . I said , ' Why not ? ' My daughter was 4 or 5 , at the time . " <p> Around the same age , both of her children became fascinated by their mother 's breasts , Jones said . <p> " They both wanted to know why their nipples were little and mine were large , " recounted Jones . " I finally stopped going around nude in front of them when they were 7 . " <p> CC Brown , life skills consultant for the Child Abuse Prevention Effort in Philadelphia , said young children are naturally curious about adult bodies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bedroom or bathroom . <p> " Between the ages of 2 and 7 , they are very curious about gender differences , they are curious about penises and vaginas , " said Brown . <p> Even so , parents should note any behavior that appears extreme or that seems to suggest that the child has " information they should not have , " said Brown . <p> " Mildly touching themselves , masturbating themselves , is usually normal , " said Brown . " But if they want to masturbate someone else , or touch them in a way that seems like more than curiosity , then you should ask , where did they get that information ? Children are very egotistical . They care about what they can do for themselves . " <p> But even a child who seems unusually interested in specific romantic or sexual behavior is not necessarily playing out some unthinkable abuse , said Brown . Popular culture is so rife with erotic images that children may get a big dose of advanced sexual information from an afternoon soap opera , a movie on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half-naked Calvin Klein model . <p> Brown said parents who suspect that their child has been sexually victimized should rule out other possibilities first , by " looking around and finding out if there are ways for the child to get that information . You should lock your bedroom door when the child is 3 , and monitor what they watch on TV so that you do n't become confused about whether it 's sexual abuse or something else . " <p> And , if you feel compelled to talk to your child about potential abuse , " never name names , " said Brown . " Children want to please , and so they are likely to answer yes to any name you mention . "
