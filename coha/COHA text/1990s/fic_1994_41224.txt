WHEN SPRING ROLLED AROUND for the second time , the farm work was like a holiday to me , and I threw myself into it with manic good cheer , welcoming the chance to live like a normal person again . Instead of lagging behind and grousing about my aches and pains , I surged along at top speed , daring myself to stick with it , reveling in my own exertions . I was still puny for my age , but I was older and stronger , and even though it was impossible , I did all I could to keep up with Master Yehudi himself . I was out to prove something , I suppose , to stun him into respecting me , to be noticed . This was a new way of fighting back , and every time the master told me to slow down , to ease off and not push so hard ( " It 's not an Olympic sport , " he would say , " we 're not out here competing for medals , kid " ) , I felt as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were gradually regaining possession of my soul . <p> My pinky joint had healed by then . What had once been a bloody mess of tissue and bone had smoothed over into an odd , nail-less stump . I enjoyed looking at it now and running my thumb over the scar , touching that bit of me that was gone forever . I must have done it fifty or a hundred times a day , and every time I did , I would sound out the words Saint Louis in my head . I was struggling to hold on to my past , but by then the words had become just words , a ritual exercise in remembrance . They summoned forth no pictures , took me on no journeys back to where I had been . After eighteen months in Kansas , Saint Louis had been turned into a phantom city for me , and a little more of it was vanishing every day . <p> One afternoon that spring the weather became inordinately hot , boiling up to midsummer levels . The four of us were working out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for greater comfort , I saw that he was wearing something around his neck : a leather thong with a small , transparent globe hanging from it like a jewel or an ornament . When I approached him to have a better look ( merely curious , with no ulterior motive ) , I saw that it was my missing pinky joint , encased in the pendant along with some kind of clear liquid . The master must have noticed my surprise , for he glanced down at his chest with an expression of alarm  --  as if he thought a spider might be crawling there . When he saw what it was , he took hold of the globe in his fingers and held it out to me , smiling with satisfaction . " A pretty little widget , eh Walt ? " he said . <p> " I do n't know about pretty , " I said , " but it looks awful familiar to me . " <p> " It should . It used to belong to you . For the first ten years of your life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " It still is . Just because it 's detached from my body , that do n't make it any less mine than before . " <p> " It 's pickled in formaldehyde . Preserved like some dead fetus in a jar . It does n't belong to you now , it belongs to science . " <p> " Yeah , then what 's it doing around your neck ? If it belongs to science , why not donate it to the wax museum ? " <p> " Because it has special meaning for me , sport . I wear it to remind myself of the debt I owe you . Like a hangman 's noose . This thing is the albatross of my conscience , and I ca n't let it fall into a stranger 's hands . " <p> " What about my hands , then ? Fair is fair , and I want my joint back . If anyone wears that necklace , it 's got to be me . " <p> " I 'll make a bargain with you . If you let me hold on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as yours . That 's a promise . It 's got your name on it , and once I get you off the ground , you can have it back . " <p> " For keeps ? " <p> " For keeps . Of course for keeps . " <p> " And how long is this ' little longer ' going to be ? " <p> " Not long . You 're already standing on the brink . " <p> " The only brink I 'm standing on is the brink of perdition . And if that ' s where I am , that 's where you are , too . Ai n't that so , master ? " <p> " You catch on fast , son . United we stand , divided we fall . You for me and me for you , and where we stop nobody knows . " <p> This was the second time I had been given encouraging news about my progress . First from Mother Sioux , and now from the master himself . I wo n't deny that I felt flattered , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see that I was one jot closer to success . After that sweltering afternoon in May , we went through a period of epic heat , the hottest summer in living memory . The ground was a caldron , and every time you walked on it , you felt as if the soles would melt right off your shoes . We prayed for rain at supper every evening , and for three months not a single drop fell from the sky . The air became so parched , so delirious in its desiccation , you could track the buzzing of a horsefly from a hundred yards away . Everything seemed to itch , to rasp like thistle rubbing against barbed wire , and the stench from the outhouse was so bad it singed the hairs in your nostrils . The corn wilted , drooped , and died ; the lettuce bolted to grotesque , gargantuan heights , standing in the garden like mutant towers . By mid-August , you could drop a pebble down the well and count to six before you heard the water plink . No green beans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the year before . We subsisted on eggs and mush and smoked ham , and while there was enough to see us through the summer , our diminishing stores boded ill for the months that lay ahead . " Tighten your belts , children , " the master would say to us at supper , " tighten your belts and chew until you ca n't taste it anymore . If we do n't stretch out what we have , it 's going to be a long , hungry winter . " <p> For all the woes that assailed us during the drought , I was happy , much happier than would have seemed possible . I had weathered the most gruesome parts of my initiation , and what stood before me now were the stages of mental struggle , the showdown between myself and myself . Master Yehudi was hardly an obstacle anymore . He would issue his commands and then disappear from my mind , leading me into places of such inwardness that I no longer remembered who I was . The physical stages had been a war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he had never withdrawn from my sight , standing over me as he studied my reactions , watching my face for each microscopic shudder of pain . All that was finished now . He had become a gentle , munificent guide , talking in the soft voice of a seducer as he lured me into accepting one bizarre task after another . He had me go into the barn and count every blade of straw in the horse 's stall . He had me stand on one leg for an entire night , then stand on the other leg for the whole of the next night . He tied me to a post in the midday sun and ordered me to repeat his name ten thousand times . He imposed a vow of silence on me , and for twenty-four days I did not speak to anyone , did not utter a sound even when I was alone . He had me roll my body across the yard , he had me hop , he had me jump through hoops . He taught me how to cry at will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cry at the same time . He made me teach myself how to juggle , and once I could juggle three stones , he made me juggle four . He blindfolded me for a week , then he plugged my ears for a week , then he bound my arms and legs together for a week and made me crawl on my belly like a worm . <p> The weather broke in early September . Downpours , lightning and thunder , high winds , a tornado that barely missed carrying away the house . Water levels rose again , but otherwise we were no better off than we had been . The crops had failed , and with nothing to add to our long-term supplies , prospects for the future were bleak , touch and go at best . The master reported that farmers all over the region had been similarly devastated , and the mood in town was turning ugly . Prices were down , credit was scarce , and talk of bank foreclosures was in the air . When pocketbooks are empty , the master said , brains fill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all I care , " he continued , " but after a while they 're going to look for someone to blame their troubles on , and when that happens , the four of us had better duck . " Throughout that strange autumn of storms and drenchings , Master Yehudi seemed distracted with worry , as if he were contemplating some unnameable disaster , a thing so black he dared not even mention it to us . After coddling me all summer , urging me on through the rigors of my spiritual exercises , he suddenly seemed to have lost interest in me . His absences became more frequent , once or twice he stumbled in with what smelled like liquor on his breath , and he had all but abandoned his study sessions with Aesop . A new sadness had crept into his eyes , a look of wistfulness and foreboding . Much of this is dim to me now , but I remember that during the brief moments when he graced me with his company , he acted with surprising warmth . One incident stands out from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked into the house with a newspaper under his arm and a big grin on his face . " I have good news for you , " he said to me , sitting down and spreading out the paper on the kitchen table . " Your team won . I hope that makes you glad , because it says here it 's been thirty-eight years since they came out on top . " <p> " My team ? " I said . <p> " The Saint Louis Cardinals . That 's your team , is n't it ? " <p> " You bet it is . I 'm with those Redbirds till the end of time . " <p> " Well , they 've just won the World Series . According to what 's printed here , the seventh game was the most breathless , riveting contest of the century . " <p> That was how I learned my boys had become the 1926 champions . Master Yehudi read me the account of the dramatic seventh inning , when Grover Cleveland Alexander came in to strike out Tony Lazzeri with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought he was making it up . The last I 'd heard , Alexander was top dog on the Phillie staff , and Lazzeri was a name that meant nothing to me . It sounded like a pile of foreign noodles smothered in garlic sauce , but then the master informed me that he was a rookie and that Grover had been traded to the Cards in mid-season . He 'd hurled nine innings just the day before , shutting down the Yanks to knot the Series at three games apiece , and here was Rogers Hornsby calling him in from the bullpen to snuff out a rally with the whole ball of wax on the line . And the old guy sauntered in , drunk as a skunk from last night 's bender , and mowed down the young New York hotshot . If not for a couple of inches , it would have been another story . On the pitch before the third strike , Lazzeri drove one into the left field seats , a sure grand slam that hooked foul at the last second . It was enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your drawers . Alexander hung in there through the eighth and ninth to nail down the win , and to top it off , the game and the Series ended when Babe Ruth , the one and only Sultan of Swat , was thrown out trying to steal second base . There had never been anything like it . It was the maddest , most infernal game in history , and my Redbirds were the champs , the best team in the world . <p> That was a watershed for me , a landmark event of my young life , but otherwise the fall was a somber stretch , a long interlude of boredom and quiet . After a while , I got so antsy that I even asked Aesop if he would n't mind teaching me how to read . He was more than willing , but he had to clear it with Master Yehudi first , and when the master gave his approval , I confess that I was a little hurt . He had always said how he wanted to keep me stupid  --  how it was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now he had blithely gone ahead and reversed himself without any explanation . For a time I thought it meant he had given up on me , and disappointment festered in my heart , a hangdog sorrow that dragged down all my bright dreams and turned them to dust . What had I done wrong , I asked myself , and why had he deserted me when I most needed him ? <p> So I learned the letters and numbers with Aesop 's help , and once I got started , they came so quickly that I wondered what all the fuss had been about . If I was n't going to fly , at least I could convince the master that I was n't a dolt , but so little effort was involved , it soon felt like a hollow victory . Spirits around the house picked up for a while in November when our food shortage was suddenly eliminated . Without telling anyone where he 'd found the money to do such a thing , the master had secretly arranged for a delivery of canned goods . It felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the blue . A truck arrived at our door one morning and two burly men began unloading cartons from the back . There were hundreds of boxes , and each box contained two dozen cans of food : vegetables of every variety , meats and broths , puddings , preserved apricots and peaches , an outflow of unimaginable abundance . It took the men over an hour to haul the shipment into the house , and the whole time the master just stood there with his arms folded across his chest , grinning like a crafty old owl . Aesop and I both gawked , and after a while he called us over to him and put a hand on each of our shoulders . " It ca n't hold a candle to Mother Sioux 's cooking , " he said , " but it 's a damn sight better than mush , eh boys ? When the chips are down , just remember who to count on . No matter how dark our troubles might be , I 'll always find a way to pull us through . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . Our larder was full again , and we no longer stood up from meals craving more , no longer moaned about our gurgling bellies . You 'd think this turnaround would have earned our undying gratitude , but the fact was that we quickly learned to take it for granted . Within ten days , it seemed perfectly normal that we should be eating well , and by the end of the month it was hard to remember the days when we had n't . That 's how it is with want . As long as you lack something , you yearn for it without cease . If only I could have that one thing , you tell yourself , all my problems would be solved . But once you get it , once the object of your desires is thrust into your hands , it begins to lose its charm . Other wants assert themselves , other desires make themselves felt , and bit by bit you discover that you 're right back where you started . So it was with my reading lessons ; so it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had thought those things would make a difference , but in the end they were no more than shadows , substitute longings for the one thing I really wanted  --  which was precisely the thing I could n't have . I needed the master to love me again . That 's what the story of those months came down to . I hungered for the master 's affections , and no amount of food was ever going to satisfy me . After two years , I had learned that everything I was flowed directly from him . He had made me in his own image , and now he was n't there for me anymore . For reasons I could n't understand , I felt I had lost him forever . <p> It never occurred to me to think of Mrs. Witherspoon . Not even when Mother Sioux dropped a hint one night about the master 's " widow lady " in Wichita did I put six and three together . I was backward in that regard , an eleven-year-old know-it-all who did n't understand the first thing that went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all carnal , intermittent spasms of wayward lust , and when Aesop talked to me about planting his boners in a nice warm quim ( he had just turned seventeen ) , I immediately thought of the whores I 'd known in Saint Louis , the blowsy , wisecracking dolls who strutted up and down the alleys at two in the morning , peddling their bodies for cold , hard cash . I did n't know dirt about grown-up love or marriage or any of the so-called lofty sentiments . The only married couple I 'd seen was Uncle Slim and Aunt Peg , and that was such a brutal combination , such a frenzy of spitting , cursing , and clamor , it probably makes sense that I was so ignorant . When the master went away , I figured he was playing poker somewhere or belting back a bottle of rotgut in a Cibola speakeasy . It never dawned on me that he was in Wichita courting a high-class lady like Marion Witherspoon  --  and gradually getting his heart broken in the process . I had actually laid eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and feverish at the time that I could scarcely remember her . She was a hallucination , a figment born in the throes of death , and even though her face flashed through me every now and then , I did not credit her as real . If anything , I thought she was my mother  --  but then I would grow scared , appalled that I did n't know who she was , that I could n't recognize my own mother 's ghost . <p> It took a couple of near disasters to set me straight . In early December , Aesop cut his finger opening a can of cling peaches . It seemed like nothing at first , a simple scratch that would heal in no time , but instead of scabbing over as it should have , it swelled up into a frightful bloat of pus and rawness , and by the third day poor Aesop was languishing in bed with a high fever . It was fortunate that Master Yehudi was home then , for in addition to his other talents , he had a fair knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s room the next morning to see how the patient was doing , he walked out two minutes later shaking his head and blinking back a rush of tears . " There 's no time to waste , " he said to me . " Gangrene has set in , and unless we get rid of that finger now , it 's liable to spread through his hand and up into his arm . Run outside and tell Mother Sioux to drop what she 's doing and put on two pots of water to boil . I 'll go down to the kitchen and sharpen the knives . We have to operate within the hour . " <p> I did what I was told , and once I 'd rounded up Mother Sioux from the barnyard , I went back into the house , climbed the stairs to the second floor , and parked myself beside my friend . Aesop looked dreadful . The lustrous black of his skin had turned to a chalky , mottled gray , and I could hear the phlegm rattling in his chest as his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hang on , buddy , " I said . " There 's no need to fret . The master 's going to fix you up . Before you know it , you 'll be downstairs at the ivories again , twiddling out one of your goofy rags . " <p> " Walt ? " he said . " Is that you , Walt ? " He opened his bloodshot eyes and looked in the direction of my voice , but his pupils were so glazed over I was n't sure if he could see me . <p> " Of course it 's me , " I answered . " Who else do you think would be sitting here at a time like this ? " <p> " He ' s going to cut off my finger , Walt . I 'll be deformed for life , and no girl is ever going to want me . " <p> " You 're already deformed for life , and that has n't stopped you from hankering for twat , has it ? He ai n't going to cut off your dick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your left hand at that . As long as your willy 's still attached , you can bang the broads till kingdom come . " <p> " I do n't want to lose my finger , " he cried . " If I lose my finger , it means there 's no justice . It means that God has turned his back on me . " <p> " I ai n't got but nine and a half fingers myself , and it do n't bother me hardly at all . Once you lose yours , we 'll be just like twins . Bona-fide members of the Nine Finger Club , brothers till the day we drop  --  just like the master always said . " <p> I did what I could to reassure him , but once the operation began , I was shunted to the side and forgotten . I stood in the doorway with my hands over my face , peeking through the cracks every now and then as the master and Mother Sioux did their work . There was no ether or anesthetic , and Aesop howled and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never slackened from start to finish . Sorry as I felt for him , those howls nearly undid me . They were inhuman , and the terror they expressed was so deep and so prolonged , it was all I could do not to begin screaming myself . Master Yehudi went about his business with the calm of a trained doctor , but the howls got to Mother Sioux just as badly as they got to me . That was the last thing I was expecting from her . I had always thought that Indians hid their feelings , that they were braver and more stoical than white folks , but the truth was that Mother S. was unhinged , and as the blood continued to spurt and Aesop 's pain continued to mount , she gasped and whimpered as if the knife was tearing into her own flesh . Master Yehudi told her to get a grip on herself . She apologized , but fifteen seconds later she started sobbing again . She was a pitiful nurse , and after a while her tearful interruptions so distracted the master that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We need a fresh bucket of boiling water , " he said . " Snap to it , woman . On the double . " It was just an excuse to get rid of her , and as she rushed past me into the hall , she buried her face in her hands and wept on blindly to the top of the stairs . I had a clear view of everything that happened after that : the way her foot snagged on the first step , the way her knee buckled as she tried to right her balance , and then the headlong fall down the stairs  --  the thumping , tumbling career of her huge bulk crashing to the bottom . She landed with a thud that shook the entire house . An instant later she let out a shriek , then grabbed hold of her left leg and started writhing around on the floor . " You dumb old bitch , " she said to herself . " You dumb old floozy bitch , now look what you done . You fell down the stairs and broke your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks , the house was as gloomy as a hospital . There were two invalids to be taken care of , and the master and I spent our days rushing up and down the stairs , serving them their meals and emptying their potties and doing everything short of wiping their bedridden asses . Aesop was in a funk of self-pity and dejection , Mother Sioux rained down curses on herself from morning to night , and what with the animals to be looked after in the barn and the rooms to be cleaned and the beds to be made and the dishes to be washed and the stove to be fed , there was n't so much as a minute left over for the master and me to do our work . Christmas was approaching , the time when I was supposed to be off the ground , and I was still as subject to the laws of gravity as I had ever been . It was my darkest moment in over a year . I 'd been turned into a regular citizen who did his chores and knew how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any longer , I 'd probably wind up taking elocution lessons and joining the Boy Scouts . <p> One morning , I woke up a little earlier than usual . I checked in on Aesop and Mother Sioux , saw that they were both still asleep , and tiptoed down the stairs , intending to surprise the master with my predawn levee . Ordinarily , he would have been down in the kitchen at that hour , cooking breakfast and preparing to start the day . But there were no smells of coffee wafting up from the stove , no sounds of bacon crackling in the pan , and sure enough , when I entered the room it turned out to be empty . He 's in the barn , I told myself , gathering eggs or milking one of the cows , but then I realized that the stove had not been lit . Starting the fire was the first order of business on winter mornings , and the temperature downstairs was frigid , cold enough for me to send forth a burst of vapor every time I exhaled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy is fagged out and wanted to catch up on his beauty sleep . That would certainly put a new twist on things , would n't it ? For me to be the one to rouse him from bed instead of vice versa . So I went back upstairs and knocked on his bedroom door , and when there was no response after several tries , I opened the door and gingerly stepped across the threshold . Master Yehudi was nowhere to be found . Not only was he not in his bed , but the bed itself was neatly made and bore no signs of having been slept in that night . He 's run out on us , I said to myself . He 's upped and skedaddled , and that 's the last we 'll ever see of him . <p> For the next hour , my mind was a free-for-all of desperate thoughts . I spun from sorrow to anger , from belligerence to laughter , from snarling grief to vile self-mockery . The universe had gone up in smoke , and I was left to dwell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of betrayal . <p> Mother Sioux and Aesop slept on in their beds , oblivious to my rantings and my tears . Somehow or other ( I ca n't remember how I got there ) , I was down in the kitchen again , lying on my stomach with my face pressed against the floor , rubbing my nose into the filthy wooden planks . There were no more tears to be gotten out of me  --  only a dry , choked heaving , an aftermath of hiccups and scorched , airless breaths . Presently I grew still , almost tranquil , and bit by bit a sense of calm spread through me , radiating out among my muscles and oozing toward the tips of my fingers and toes . There were no more thoughts in my head , no more feelings in my heart . I was weightless inside my own body , floating on a placid wave of nothingness , utterly detached and indifferent to the world around me . And that 's when it happened for the first time  --  without warning , without the least notion that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt my body rise off the floor . The movement was so natural , so exquisite in its gentleness , it was n't until I opened my eyes that I understood my limbs were touching only air . I was not far off the ground  --  no more than an inch or two , but I hung there without effort , suspended like the moon in the night sky , motionless and aloft , conscious only of the air fluttering in and out of my lungs . I ca n't say how long I hovered like that , but at a certain moment , with the same slowness and gentleness as before , I eased back to the ground . Everything had been drained out of me by then , and my eyes were already shut . Without so much as a single thought about what had just taken place , I fell into a deep , dreamless sleep , sinking like a dead man to the bottom of the world . <p> I woke to the sound of voices , the shuffling of shoes against the bare wood floor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly into the blackness of Master Yehudi 's left trouser leg . " Greetings , kid , " he said , nudging me with his foot . " Forty winks on the cold kitchen floor . Not the best place for a nap if you want to stay healthy . " <p> I tried to sit up , but my body felt so dull and turgid , it took all my strength just to lift myself onto one elbow . My head was a trembling mass of cobwebs , and no matter how hard I rubbed and blinked my eyes , I could n't get them to focus properly . <p> " What 's the trouble , Walt ? " the master continued . " You have n't been walking in your sleep , have you ? " <p> " No , sir . Nothing like that . " <p> " Then why so glum ? You look like you 've been to a funeral . " <p> An immense sadness swept through me when he said that , and I suddenly felt myself on the verge of tears . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his leg with both arms and pressing my cheek against his shin . " Oh , master , I thought you 'd left me . I thought you 'd left me and were never coming back . " <p> The moment those words left my lips , I understood that I was wrong . It was n't the master who had caused this feeling of vulnerability and despair , it was the thing I 'd done just prior to falling asleep . It all came back in a vivid , nauseating rush : the moments I had spent off the ground , the certainty that I had done what most certainly I could not have done . I had actually levitated , and rather than fill me with ecstasy or gladness , this breakthrough overpowered me with dread , a horror at the thought of who I had become . I did n't know myself anymore . I was inhabited by something that was n't me , and that thing was so terrible , so alien in its newness , I could n't bring myself to talk about it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come pouring out of me , and once I started , I was n't sure I 'd ever be able to stop . <p> " Dear boy , " the master said , " my dear , sweet boy . " He lowered himself to the ground and gathered me into his arms , patting my back and hugging me close to him as I went on weeping . Then , after a pause , I heard him speak again  --  but he was no longer addressing his words to me . For the first time since regaining consciousness , I understood that another person was present in the room . <p> " He 's the bravest lad who ever was , " the master said . " He 's worked so hard , he 's worn himself out . A body can bear just so much , and I 'm afraid the poor little fellow 's all done in . " <p> That was when I finally looked up . I lifted my head off Master Yehudi 's lap , cast my eyes about for a moment , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doorway . She was wearing a crimson overcoat , I remember , and a black fur hat . Her cheeks were still flushed from the winter cold , and the instant our eyes met , she broke into a smile . <p> " Hello , Walt , " she said . <p> " And hello to you , ma'am , " I said , doing the best I could to cover up my embarrassment . <p> " Meet your fairy godmother , " the master said . " Mrs. Witherspoon has come to rescue us , and she 'll be staying in the house for a little while . Until things get back to normal . " <p> " You 're the lady from Wichita , ai n't you ? " I said , realizing why her face looked so familiar to me . <p> " That 's right , " she said . " And you 're the little boy who lost his way in the storm . " <p> " That was a long time ago , " I said , extricating myself from the master 's arms and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember much about it . " <p> " No , " she said , " you probably do n't . But I do . " <p> " Not only is Mrs. Witherspoon a friend of the family , " the master said , " she 's our number one champion and business partner . Just so you know the score , Walt . I want you to bear that in mind while she 's here with us . The food that feeds you , the clothes that clothe you , the fire that warms you  --  all that comes courtesy of Mrs. Witherspoon , and it would be a sad day if you ever forgot it . " <p> " Do n't worry , " I said , suddenly feeling some spring in my soul again . " I ai n't no slob . When a handsome lady enters my house , I know how a gentleman is supposed to act . " <p> Without missing a beat , I turned my eyes in Mrs. Witherspoon 's direction , and with all the poise and bravura I could muster , flashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ womankind . To her credit , Mrs. Witherspoon neither blushed nor stammered . Giving as good as she got , she let out a brief laugh , and then , as cool and collected as an old bawd , tossed back a playful wink at me . It was a moment I still cherish , and the instant it happened , I knew that we were going to be friends . <p> I had no idea what the master 's arrangement with her was , and at the time I did n't give the matter much thought . What concerned me was that Mrs. Witherspoon was there and that her presence relieved me of my job as nursemaid and bottle washer . She took things in hand that first morning , and for the next three weeks the household ran as smoothly as a new pair of roller skates . To be honest , I did n't think she would be capable of it , at least not when Z saw her in that fancy coat and those expensive gloves . She looked like a woman who was used to having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough in a fragile sort of way , her skin was too pale for my taste and there was too little meat on her bones . It took me some time to adjust to her , since she did n't fit into any of the female categories I was familiar with . She was n't a flapper or a hussy , she was n't a meek little housewifey blob , she was n't a schoolmarm or a virgin battle-ax  --  but somehow a bit of all of them , which meant that you could never quite pin her down or predict what person she was going to be next . The only thing that seemed clear to me was that the master was in love with her . He always grew very still and soft-spoken when she was around , and more than once I caught him staring at her with a far-off look in his eyes when her head was turned the other way . Since they slept together in the same room every night and I heard the bed creak and bounce with a certain regularity , I took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . What I did n't know was that she had already turned him down in marriage three times  --  but even if I had known , I doubt it would have made much difference . I had other things on my mind just then , and they were a hell of a lot more important to me than the ups and downs of the master 's love life . <p> I kept to myself as much as possible during those weeks , hiding out in my room as I explored the mysteries and terrors of my new gift . I did everything I could to tame it , to come to terms with it , to study its exact dimensions and accept it as a fundamental part of myself . That was the struggle : not just to master my gift , but to absorb its gruesome and shattering implications . It had marked me with a special destiny , and I would be set apart from others for the rest of my life . Imagine waking up one morning to discover that you have a new face , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of the mirror before you got used to it , before you could begin to feel comfortable with yourself again . Day after day , I would lock myself in my room , stretch out on the floor , and wish my body into the air . I practiced so much that it was n't long before I could levitate at will , lifting myself off the ground in a matter of seconds . After a couple of weeks , I discovered that it was n't necessary to lie down on the floor . If I put myself in the proper trance , I was able to do it standing up , to float a good six inches into the air from a vertical position . Three days after that , I learned that I could do it with my eyes open . I could actually look down and see my feet rising off the floor , and still the spell would not be broken . <p> Meanwhile , the life of the others swirled around me . Aesop 's bandages came off , Mother Sioux was fitted with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mrs. Witherspoon shook the bedsprings every night , filling the house with their groans . With so much hubbub to contend with , it was n't always easy to come up with an excuse for shutting myself in my room . A couple of times , I felt certain that the master saw straight through me , that he understood my duplicity and was lenient only because he wanted me out of his hair . At any other moment , I would have been consumed with jealousy to be shunned like that , to know that he preferred the company of a woman to my own sterling , inimitable presence . Now that I was airborne , however , Master Yehudi was beginning to lose his godlike properties for me , and I no longer felt under the sway of his influence . I saw him as a man , a man no better or worse than other men , and if he wanted to spend his time cavorting with a skinny wench from Wichita , that was his affair . He had his affairs and I had mine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now on . I had taught myself how to fly , after all , or at least something that resembled flying , and I assumed that meant I was my own man now , that I was beholden to no one but myself . As it turned out , I had merely advanced to the next stage of my development . Devious and cunning as ever , the master was still far ahead of me , and I had a long road to travel before I became the hotshot I thought I was . <p> Aesop drooped in his nine-fingered state , a listless shadow of his former self , and though I spent as much time with him as I could , I was too busy with my experiments to give him the kind of attention he needed . He kept asking me why I spent so many hours alone in my room , and one morning ( it must have been the fifteenth or sixteenth of December ) I let forth with a small lie to help assuage his doubts about me . I did n't want him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the circumstances it seemed better to fib than to say nothing . <p> " It 's in the nature of a surprise , " said . " If you promise not to breathe a word about it , I 'll give you a hint . " <p> Aesop eyed me with suspicion . " You 're up to another one of your tricks , are n't you ? " <p> " No tricks , I swear . What I 'm telling you is on the level , the whole gob straight from the horse 's mouth . " <p> " You do n't have to hem and haw , Walt . If you have something to say , just come out and say it . " <p> " I will . But first you 've got to promise . " <p> " This had better be good . I do n't like giving my word for no reason , you know . " <p> " Oh , it 's good all right , you can trust me on that . " <p> " Well , " he said , beginning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother ? " <p> " Raise your right hand and swear you 'll never tell . Swear on your mother 's grave . Swear on the whites of your eyeballs . Swear on the pussy of every whore in Niggertown . " <p> Aesop sighed , grabbed hold of his balls with his left hand  --  which was how the two of us swore to sacred oaths  --  and lifted his right hand into the air . " I promise , " he said , and then he repeated the things I 'd told him to say . <p> " Well , " I said , improvising as I went along , " it 's like this . Christmas is coming up next week , and what with Mrs. Witherspoon in the house and all , I 've heard talk about a celebration on the twenty-fifth . Turkey and pudding , presents , maybe even a fir tree with baubles and popcorn on it . If this shindig comes off like I think it will , I do n't want to be caught with my pants down . You know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a present if you ca n't give one in return . So that 's what I 've been up to in my room all these days . I 'm working on a present , concocting the biggest and best surprise my poor little brain can think of . I 'll be unveiling it to you in just a few days , big brother , and I hope to hell you are n't disappointed . " <p> Everything I said about the Christmas party was true . I 'd overheard the master and his lady talking about it one night through the walls , but until then it had n't occurred to me to give anyone a present . Now that I 'd planted the idea in my head , I saw it as a golden opportunity , the chance I 'd been waiting for all along . If there was a Christmas dinner ( and that same night the master announced there would be ) , I would use the occasion to show off my new talent . That would be my present to them . I would stand up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be known to the world . <p> I spent the next week and a half in a cold sweat . It was one thing to perform my stunts in private , but how could I be sure I would n't fall on my face when I walked out in front of them ? If I did n't come through , I 'd be turned into a laughingstock , the butt of every joke for the next twenty-seven years . So began the longest , most tormented day of my life . From whatever angle you chose to look at it , the Yuletide bash was a triumph , a veritable banquet of laughter and gaiety , but I did n't enjoy myself one bit . I could barely chew the turkey for fear of choking on it , and the mashed turnips tasted like a mixture of library paste and mud . <p> By the time we moved into the parlor to sing songs and exchange presents , I was ready to pass out . Mrs. Witherspoon started off by giving me a blue sweater with red reindeer stitched across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handknit argyle socks , and then the master gave me a spanking new white baseball . Finally , Aesop gave me the portrait of Sir Walter Raleigh , which he had cut out of the book and mounted in a sleek ebony frame . They were all generous gifts , but each time I unwrapped one , I could do no more than mumble a grim , inaudible thanks . Each present meant that I was drawing closer to the moment of truth , and each one sapped a little more of the spirit out of me . I sank down into my chair , and by the time I 'd opened the last one , I had all but resolved to cancel the demonstration . I was n't prepared , I told myself , I still needed more practice , and once I started in with those arguments , I had no trouble talking myself out of it . Then , just when I 'd managed to glue my ass to the chair forever , Aesop piped in with his two cents and the ceiling fell on top of me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said in all innocence , thinking I was a man of my word . " He 's got something up his sleeve , and I ca n't wait for him to spring it on us . " <p> " That 's right , " the master said , turning to me with one of his piercing , all-knowing looks . " Young Mr. Rawley has yet to be heard from . " <p> I was on the spot . I did n't have another present , and if I stalled any longer , they 'd see me for the selfish ingrate I really was . So I stood up from my chair , my knees knocking together , and said in a scratchy little churchmouse voice : " Here goes , ladies and gentlemen . If it do n't work , you ca n't say it 's from want of trying . " <p> The four of them were looking at me with such curiosity , such a raptness of puzzlement and attention , that I shut my eyes to block them out . I took a long slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loose , slack-jointed way I 'd worked on for so many hours , and went into my trance . I began to rise almost immediately , lifting off the ground in a smooth and gradual ascent , and when I reached a height of six or seven inches  --  the maximum I was capable of in those early months  --  I opened my eyes and looked out at my audience . Aesop and the two women were gaping in wonder , their three mouths formed into identical little o 's . The master was smiling , however , smiling as tears rolled down his cheeks , and even as I hovered before him , I saw that he was already reaching for the leather strap behind his collar . By the time I floated down again , he had slipped the necklace over his head and was holding it out to me in his extended palm . No one said a word . I started walking toward him , crossing the room with my eyes fixed on his eyes , not daring to look anywhere else . When I came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my finger joint from him and then fell to my knees , burying my face in his lap . I held on like that for close to a minute , and when I finally found the courage to stand up again , I ran from the room , rushing to the kitchen and out into the cold night air-gasping for breath , gasping for life under the immensity of the winter stars . <p>
