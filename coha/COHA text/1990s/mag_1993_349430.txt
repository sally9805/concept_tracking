Q. If you were the director of the CIA , what priorities would you set for the next decade ? <P> A. What I would require of my intelligence service would be a real liaison with major existing intelligence services on shared targets . That would include terrorism and nuclear weapons , all these loose cannons we 've got sloshing around in Ukraine . If some crazed national movement got hold of nuclear weapons , then I think there should be a joint effort among intelligence agencies that should be pooled by the United Nations . <P> Q. Wo n't countries be reluctant to share intelligence data with one another through the U.N. ? <P> A. Those are barriers which somehow or another have to be dismantled . Those ( are our cold war manners . Of course , all intelligence services like to retain their mystique . The first thing the Americans do if they get a wonderful report from the Israelis is edit it , retitle it , put all sorts of stamps all over it and shove it upstairs . This is another reason , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same source can fund a whole lot of seemingly separate intelligence documents . Let 's say , the Israelis prepare a document which they 're prepared to give to an American liaison . They 're also prepared to give another version of this same intelligence to the French . The French receive it and immediately signal some of it for economic gain to the Syrians . Then the National Security Agency comes in , intercepts France to Damascus , and there you get corroboration of the intelligence which has already come through from the same source . It 's the proof cooked three different ways , but has actually come from the same source . <P> Q. Intelligence gathering by human spies is now coming back into vogue . Would n't that be far more effective than satellites in a place like Somalia ? <P> A. That would be great , but you 've really got to buy somebody who is there . You 've got to deal through intermediaries you know . You 're going through a whole ladder of contacts  --  you end up sending a gold vase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never see the gold vase again  --  you never get any intelligence . It requires a street wisdom suddenly in a particular area which is terribly hard for an intelligence service to produce when the President suddenly says , " Get me that damned warlord . " <P> Q. One of the great intelligence debacles of the cold war was the overestimation of the Soviet Union 's capabilities . How did that happen ? <P> A. I think it was a failure of intelligence and , in a curious way , a failure of common sense . The overkill of coverage was so immense that they literally started counting the cows twice , that when you have huge amounts of data coming in , it 's very easy to lose count as simply as that . But the failure of common sense is absolutely weird in its stupidity . Any good journalist who 'd been living in Moscow in the later years of Brezhnev would know that nothing worked anymore . The knight was dying inside his armor , and somehow that human perception never made itself felt in intelligence analyses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causes spies not to see the bigger picture ?
