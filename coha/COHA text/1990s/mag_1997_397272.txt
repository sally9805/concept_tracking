The One You 'll be Motivated to Use <p> This time of the year in many places snow , ice , freezing rain , and harsh winds that bore into your bones make the hardest part of outdoor exercise finding the motivation to open the door . Then , an exercise machine indoors is an attractive alternative or cross-training tool . But what to choose ? You can scan the advertisements in health and fitness magazines and read claims of great fat-burning characteristics that make the pounds melt off . Buyer beware . Most of these claims are without foundation , and the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) recently fired a warning shot by pressuring one of the leading equipment manufacturers to cease making claims it could not support  --  and this , a company that makes excellent products . <p> The weight-loss claims are largely myths . The primary reasons to exercise are to gain cardiovascular benefits that reduce your risks of high blood pressure , diabetes , heart disease , and some cancers ; to slow the decline in muscle strength that comes with years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in good shape . Exercise is not the primary tool for weight loss , but it is the primary way to avoid regaining weight lost by a proper diet ( see " Exercise Is Not A Major Player In Weight Loss , " CR , December 1995 ) . <p> That said , which machines give you the best physiological gains ? <p> How Do Machines Rank ? The studies on exercise equipment show inconsistent , seemingly contradictory results , depending on the clinical protocols used . <p> For example , Philip Clifford , P.E.D. , and colleagues at the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee reported the following finding : " The treadmill is the optimal indoor exercise machine for enhancing energy expenditure when perceived exertion is used to establish exercise intensity . " In this study , women and men spent four weeks learning the perceived exertion technique ( which relates how they felt physically to different levels of exertion , judged by heart rates ) , and becoming accustomed to different machines . Then these researchers tested a treadmill , stationary bike , cross-country skiing machine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , somewhat hard , and hard levels of exertion . Heart rates were higher for the treadmill and stair stepper . Blood lactates  --  a measure of exercise intensity  --  were higher for the stair stepper and rowing machine , and oxygen uptakes highest on the treadmill . <p> In another study , men and women trained on either stationary bikes , treadmills , stair steppers , or cross-country ski machines for 12 weeks at an imposed 84% of maximal heart rate . All the exercisers lost six or seven pounds , and increased their maximal oxygen uptake ( a measure of aerobic fitness ) by about four milliliters per kilogram of body weight per minute . In this case , there were no significant differences between groups using the different machines , according to John Porcari , P.E.D. , and colleagues at the University of Wisconsin , La Crosse . Since the subjects all worked out at exactly the same intensity ( heart rate ) on each machine , this result sounds logical . <p> Yet when the same researchers allowed subjects to work out at whatever intensity they chose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and burned more calories per session on the cross-country ski machines . Again , this would make sense , since this is weight-bearing exercise and you use more muscle groups on these machines than on the others . <p> Ten weeks of training on upper-body and on lower-body resistance machines produced the same aerobic benefits as a walking and jogging program , with all exercise modes at the same intensity , judged by oxygen uptake , in a study led by Joel Hourmard , Ph.D. , at East Carolina University in Greenville , N.C. <p> In a study at the University of Tsukuba in Japan comparing stationary bikes and bench steppers , previously trained women achieved 11% higher oxygen uptakes and 4% higher heart rates on the bench steppers . On a machine built to combine a stair stepper and a treadmill , exercisers achieved the same heart rates and oxygen uptakes at lower speeds than a regular treadmill , and with less impact than on a regular stair stepper , according to Robert Otto , Ph.D. , and colleagues at Adelphi University in Garden City , New York . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and women worked out at 60% of maximal aerobic capacity on either a stair climber , slideboard , or stationary bike . The bikers achieved higher heart rates , exercise blood pressure , and oxygen uptake compared to the stair climbers , who outperformed the slideboarders . <p> Finally , at the University of Idaho in Moscow , untrained people who worked out on slideboards , treadmills , or stationary bikes achieved equivalent cardiovascular conditioning , judged by maximal oxygen uptake . <p> Thus , you can see from these results that there is no clearly superior exercise machine . You can achieve different results using different experimental design . There is one thing that all the studies have in common : they show that all exercise machines give physiological benefits . The choice becomes a matter of personal preference . Individuals vary widely in response to choice of exercise . Something that excites one person will bore the next person . People will seldom keep up an activity that they do not enjoy , so you really need to discover what works best for you . <p> Characteristics of Machines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditioning . You can also improve leg-muscle strength running fast on an inclined treadmill in short bursts . Treadmills can usually be inclined up to 10 or 11 Degrees . You can find a few that go up to 25 Degrees , which is beyond the point most people can keep good running form . There are treadmills with variable-speed programs which let you choose one of several interval routines . These are short , fast spells , alternating with slow recovery periods . Some treadmills let you enter you own interval routines . <p> Inexpensive treadmills tend to have narrow treads and lower power motors . For walking this may not matter . If you want to run , you 're advised to buy a treadmill costing more than $1,000 for the extra power . For a selection of variable programs , typically you 'll spend about $2,000 , and top of the line machines may be up to $4,000 or more . <p> Stationary bikes also give cardiovascular conditioning through leg power , but with lower impact than running , which tends to reduce injury risk . For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking and running , because your body weight is supported . Machines with variable resistance flywheels cost $400 to $800 . Bikes with moving handlebars increase the quality of the conditioning , and improve arm muscle tone , too . These cost up to $2,000 with intervals programs built in . Top-of-the-line exercise bikes have an air-brake wheel for resistance , and these cost even more then the flywheel models . <p> Standard stair steppers use air or fluid-filled cylinders for resistance . They do n't feel the same as climbing a flight of stairs . Instead , you 'll feel as though you 're on a bike standing on the pedals , off the saddle . They may cost $300 to $600 . Computer-controlled steppers have interval programs , and resistance provided by electrical or electromagnetic brakes . These cost $1,500 to $3,000 . <p> Cross-country ski machines simulate the kick-and-glide movements of cross-country skiing . They use a flywheel and belt mechanism , and a cord and pulley mechanism for the upper-body motion . Dependent machines have linked footpads ; one foot slides forward while the other automatically slides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gives a less effective workout . Machines with independent leg moves are more like skiing , give you a better workout , but take longer to get used to . Basic-design machines cost around $500 ; fancier machines can cost $8,000 and up . <p> Simple hydraulic rowing machines cost $200 to $350 . They are low impact and work out all your major muscle groups . If you like rowing on water , you may prefer the more realistic feel of resistance provided by a belt rotating over a wheel . Best of all is a machine with an air-brake wheel , and the top-of-the-line models cost up to $3,000 . <p> Slideboards are a smooth polymer-finished sliding board on a rubber base mat . They provide a pair of shoe covers , and your feet and legs mimic the gliding movements of a speed skater . Several studies have shown you can achieve cardiovascular workouts on a slideboard that are just as good as those on a machine , but they cost only from $80 . <p> There are multi-weight stations that let you perform resistance exercises . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pushing or pulling on a handle attached to pulleys or levers . Weight-strap machines provide resistance by straps between a lever arm and the machine 's frame . You can increase resistance by adding more straps , weight-plates , or both . Both types of machine cost from $1,000 . <p> More sophisticated resistance machines provide resistance with either hydraulic fluid-filled cylinders , or pneumatic air-filled cylinders . Simple machines that allow a few exercises begin at about $1,500 . More versatile machines cost more , and you can readily spend several thousand dollars for a home gym system . <p> Simpler resistance exercises can be performed with much cheaper flexible cords , or rods hooked on a cable , which you can set up at convenient locations in your home . <p> If machines are not for you , consider home workouts using free weights . Versatile dumbbells use variable weight plates , bought separately . Dumbbells are relatively safe , especially if you work only one side of your body at a time . Use many repetitions with light weights for muscle endurance , and eight to 12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also an option , but you risk favoring your dominant side , whereas with dumbbells you can work both sides to the same strength . Also , there is a safety factor . You should not use heavy weights on a barbell without the presence of a trained spotter , who knows how to save an accident . <p> You can work out your upper body , back , stomach , and some leg muscles with dumbbells or a barbell , but for more versatility ankle or wrist weights are useful . They come either with fixed weights of 21/2 or five pounds , or variable weights up to 20 pounds . <p> Do Your Homework . Some machines are expensive , take up significant space , and you do n't want to buy anything you will grow tired of and abandon after a few months . An excellent way to begin is to buy a year 's membership to a health club with certified instructors . Then arrange to try to use all the machines you think may suit your needs , and see how you like them . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Complete Home Fitness Handbook ( Human Kinetics , Champaign , IL , 1996 , pp. 250 , $14.95 ) , edited by Edmund R. Burke , Ph.D. , associate professor and director of the Exercise Science Program at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs , is a comprehensive account of the advantages and disadvantages of home exercise equipment . <p> The FTC has three brochures designed to help you make cost-effective exercise equipment choices , and avoid expensive pitfalls . " Pump Fiction " discusses : What are your goals ? Will you really use the equipment ? Can exercise help you to spot reduce ? Can you see through outrageous claims ? Have you checked the fine print ? Can you try the equipment before you buy ? Finally , have you shopped around ? <p> " Avoiding the Muscle Hustle " reminds you : Look for equipment that gives a total workout ; remember , no exercise machine or device can burn fat from a particular part of your body ; be skeptical of outrageous claims ; think twice about dramatic endorsements or before-and-after pictures from satisfied customers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product . The third brochure tests your " Exercise IQ " and then discusses the answers to the quiz . <p> You can obtain free copies of the brochures from The Federal Trade Commission , Consumer Response Center , 6th Street &; Pennsylvania Avenue , N.W. , Washington , D.C. , 20580 . You can also find them at ConsumerLine , located on the web at www.ftc.gov . <p> When you feel ready to begin shopping for the type of machine you 've enjoyed at the club , look at all the models . When you see something that interests you , try it long enough to see if you are comfortable with it . As exercise equipment sales have grown , there are now stores that specialize in used equipment . You can save a great deal of money here , but be sure to check what kind of warranty comes with a used machine . And again , try before you buy . <p> All the physiology lab comparisons do n't mean a thing unless you find a way to work out that motivates you to do it regularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercise data , you still need to find out what is your favorite way to work out . And the only way to make that discovery is to try a variety of ways . <p> ILLUSTRATIONS <p> By Trevor Smith <p> <p> Mr. Smith , a retired research scientist , is Editor of " Running and FitNews , " and a senior writer for Men 's Workout , and Exercise &; Health magazines .
