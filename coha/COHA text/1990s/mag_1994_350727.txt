" THREE STRIKES AND YOU 'RE OUT ! " FEW EXPRESSIONS OF ANTICRIME muscularity sound so satisfying , which is why , after embracing the idea in last week 's State of the Union address , Bill Clinton was rewarded with his longest standing ovation ( 22 seconds ) . Here , the President said , is a solution that 's both " tough and smart . " <P> Why is a self-proclaimed " policy wonk " like Clinton , a man who enjoys nothing better than noodling the ramifications of governmental remedies , so charmed by the kind of kindergarten criminology some of the current " three strikes " proposals represent ? Part of the reason is that little serious thinking took place . " The President was moved by the Polly Klaas case , " says White House domestic-policy assistant Bruce Reed . " He 'd dealt with crime at the grass roots in Arkansas , but after meeting with the murdered girl 's father in December he realized again that we have to do more to keep people like that off the streets . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole thing was poll driven . Even after ( ( Clinton ) ) met with Mr. Klaas , he did n't speak about three strikes until the polls said crime is our latest No. 1 issue . " To sate Clinton 's self-indulgence  --  and conform with the polls  --  the White House concluded ( surprise ) that " three strikes , " in Reed 's words , " is a defensible proposition . " <P> But smart ? " Hardly , " says Joe Biden , the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman no one has ever accused of being soft on crime . " Three strikes is the wacko " product of other Senators eager to outdo their colleagues on the toughness scale . <P> Under either of the two " three strikes " schemes the Senate has already passed ( the House has yet to act ) , a violent felon could be sent to prison for life without the possibility of parole if he committed a third , federal crime following two previous state convictions . As currently written , three strikes could work like this : a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . The same criminal stiff-arms a store clerk while swiping a coat ; strike two . Twenty years later ( there are no intervals in either proposal ) , the same person punches a federal official , or assaults someone in a national park ; strike three . The U.S. Sentencing Commission estimates that at most , only 690 federal prisoners a year would be in for life if " three strikes " were law . " With several million felonies a year , that 's not going to have a major impact on violent crime , " says Biden , who knows that the true danger of feel-good bromides like " three strikes " is that they create the illusion of problem solving . <P> But what exactly does Clinton favor ? Does he really want to sweep up the purse snatchers and coat thieves ? No one knows for sure . A few hours before last Tuesday 's speech , Vice President Gore said , " We 'll let Congress decide . " Minutes later , presidential counselor David Gergen admitted , " We do n't even know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day after Clinton 's address , White House press secretary Dee Dee Meyers echoed Gore and Gergen ; she did n't know what was on the table , only that the White House was n't going to get involved . " Actually , " insists Reed , disagreeing with Gore and Meyers , " we want to work with Congress to narrow it so we get only the really bad guys . "
