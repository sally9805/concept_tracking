All That Stroll New Orleans at dawn , and you 'll know why they call it the " Big Easy . " <p> It 's a typical morning in the theater called New Orleans . As the large cast assembles , the sunrise over the bank bathes St. Louis Cathedral in a golden spot . <p> There 's Ruthie , the Duck Lady now duckless and too old to roller-skate-taking a break on a bench in Jackson Square . <p> The Wizard pushes his wishing well toward Royal Street . <p> Painters roll their carts into the Square and begin hanging their artwork on the fence . <p> The wail of a jazz sax wafts in the air as Rasheed entertains early risers at Cafe du Monde ; competing for airwaves , a massive tanker moves upriver , bleating like a lost lamb looking for its mother . <p> As pedestrians dodge the drips from overhanging balconies lush with freshly watered plants , shop owners hose down their banquettes , cleaning away last night 's excesses . <p> A gangling , white-faced mime takes up his position on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hungry . " <p> Glaring ' malevolently through long gray locks and speaking in tongues , the Bead Lady promenades with a silver hard hat on her head . Last week 's chapeau was a red motorcycle helmet . <p> The curtain is up ; the show has begun ; and it 's only 8:30 . <p> If you 're an early morning stroller , it 's fun to deduce which of the passers-by have just gotten up and which ones were out all night . ( The man in tails is an easy guess . ) Day people and night people wo n't meet again until late afternoon when foot traffic trickles into neighborhood bars and Quarterites are either winding down or gearing up . <p> The endless parade of both conscious and unconscious eccentricities provides a fascinating feast for people watching , and the city 's old French Quarter makes the perfect backdrop . Curious customs and behavior derived from the many cultures that New Orleans adopted over the centuries flavor the days and nights . What would be regarded as strange and bizarre behavior in another city is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but cherished . Even tourists get into the act , dropping their inhibitions like so many unwieldy packages . <p> The pace is Southern slow , but the pulse is quick . That rare sense of the unexpected lies in wait around every corner . Stories hover in every bar and behind every walled courtyard . The city 's architecture , its party atmosphere , even its misty , sultry air evoke rich imaginings . Even the foods sound sensual : mirliton , cushaw , garlics , Creole tomatoes , okra , grits , chicory and roux , gumbo and etouffee . No wonder countless literary greats have embraced the hedonistic old river city as either a sometime sweetheart or a lifetime muse . <p> New Orleans ' principal allure is a way of life found only in foreign lands if at all , mostly exemplified in that old part of the city that simply can not be duplicated anywhere else . While other areas , notably the mansion-filled Garden District , are quite worthy , full of quirky charm and genteel ambiance , the real heartbeat of New Orleans is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By now the act has evolved into a 13-block constancy of good music , good food ; and good times . <p> No longer dominated by the tacky T-shirt shops and sleazy strip joints found in the first six blocks of Bourbon Street , the Quarter has a new focus along riverside DeCatur Street . Rivers of tourists stream by a fetching assortment of entertainments stretching past the new Aquarium of the Americas , specifically designed to swell the city 's coffers with family-style tourism . Other attractions along the levee are on the drawing board , prompting enthusiastic predictions of a rosy future funded by tourism . <p> At the same time , residents wonder if the fragile , crumbling old Quarter can comfortably absorb the expected overflow of bodies , automobiles , and tour buses . What the French Quarter will become in ten years time is anybody 's guess . <p> When I first moved into the Quarter , my intention to follow in the footsteps of all those famous writers , I staked my claim on one of the little tables half on the banquette and half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner of St. Louis and Chartres ( pronounce it Charters , please ) . Because I lived upstairs in a garret apartment , I did n't have far to go . <p> At this musty old literary hangout , classical music blares forth ( purists grieved when the old gramophone with scratched records was retired some ten years ago ) , and witty , intellectual repartee seems to be going on at every table . Rather than the philosophy of Sartre or Camus , probably customers are only chatting about trivialities , or debating the relative merits of an in-house muffuletta  --  a huge , heavenly Italian sandwich  --  as opposed to one from Central Grocery ( a subject good for at least a half-hour 's discourse ) . But you have your fantasies and I have mine . <p> Eventually , my Napoleon House habit gave way to the habit of eating regularly . Writing on a computer in an office , while not as picturesque , was more efficient and hence more productive than sitting in a beat-up bar writing in a beat-up notebook . Likewise , my romantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summers . Now I live in a pricey apartment with central air , two balconies , and a swimming pool . <p> Lately , with my old notebook rescued from premature burial on a sagging bookshelf , I began returning to the " Nap House . " It is exactly as before , just as though I had never left , except for more tourists to usurp my table . Classics still play , table service is still ostentatiously slow , and passing buggy drivers still spiel out tales of the failed conspiracy to spirit away the imprisoned Napoleon to " Nouvelle Orleans , " where he would reside in this very house . <p> I 'm not sure but what the tables have turned , so to speak . Could it be that sitting in a beat-up bar writing in a beat-up notebook , while less efficient , is more productive than writing on a computer in an office ? I 'll find that out soon enough . In the meantime , this place still offers the French Quarter experience distilled to its essence  --  and is likely to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this are cherished and cared for , I 'll be here . <p> Often now I sit and watch the expanding world of the Quarter amble by the Napoleon House , grazing my way through a muffuletta washed down with Dixie Beer and desultorily trying to identify Mozart or Hayden . At such times , the past hovers so tangibly I can almost feel its breath . <p> Then I always remember the words a man named Charles Dudley Warner wrote back in 1887. maybe sitting in the same ancient bar : " I suppose we are all wrongly made up and have a fallen nature ; else why is it that the most thrifty and neat and orderly city only wins our approval , and perhaps gratifies us intellectually , and such a thriftless , battered and stained , and lazy old place as the French quarter of New Orleans takes our hearts ?

While excellent restaurants are scattered all over town . large concentrations of the best are located in and near the French Quarter and the CBD . <p> Because parking is always a problem , shoe leather is the favorite form of transportation , but part of the fun is getting , around by carriage , streetcar , and riverboat . Carriages wait at Jackson Square ; streetcars rattle up scenic St. Charles Avenue and along the riverfront ; riverboats leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day and evening , churning up and down the river with their calliopes tooting madly as though auditioning for antebellum extravaganzas . <p> For an overview , consider a bus tour . Both New Orleans Tours and Gray Line of New Orleans have tour desks at major hotels and ticket offices along the riverfront . They offer city tours , boat cruises , and golf packages , as well as tours of nearby swamps , Cajun country , and River Road plantations . <p> Sponsoring on-site entertainment and weekend celebrations in adjacent Woldenberg Riverfront Park , the new Aquarium of the Americas is exceeding all projected attendance figures as it lures thousands into its cool . fishy interior . Nearby , the French Market is always lively with weekend shows and flea markets plus a 24-hour farmer 's market . <p> In Jackson Square street performers entertain constantly , and the Presbytere offers exceptional art and history exhibits .
