After Philip Schein , the CEO of U.S. Bioscience , told Wall Street analysts last November that regulatory approval for the firm 's new cancer-therapy drug was imminent , there was a stampede to buy the company 's stock . By Jan. 7 , Bioscience 's share price hit an all-time high of 85 , before a 2-for-1 split at mid-month . But on Jan. 31 came a shocker : a Food and Drug Administration panel decided not to recommend approval of the new drug , known as Ethyol . <P> That sent the stock into a free fall . It plunged 46% at the next session and never recovered . The shares are now trading at around 11 . But not all of Bioscience 's shareholders got pummeled . Schein and five vice presidents managed to bail out just in time . In the period before the FDA 's bombshell , they unloaded 1.2 million shares at prices ranging from 38 to 77 1/2 . <P> Mere coincidence ? Good luck ? Or , as corporate insiders who occupied decision-making positions and called the shots , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bioscience executives refuse to say . But in a class action , a group of angry shareholders accuse the officers of cashing in on private information . The investors charge that the Bioscience insiders knew Ethyol would be rejected by the FDA as too untested , and that they deliberately misled the public about the prospects for the drug in order to sell their stock at inflated prices . <P> The Bioscience case represents the latest form of alleged insider trading that is troubling Wall Street . Instead of stock tipsters and takeover artists , though , the new cases involve high-ranking executives whose jobs give them access to privileged information about their business . And unlike the scandals of the 1980s  --  or the charges brought last week by the Securities and Exchange Commission against investors Martin Revson and Edward Downe Jr . and others accused of making at least $13 million on inside information  --  most of the trades by corporate officers are technically legal and carried out with the full knowledge of the SEC . But a recent spate of dubious transactions by corporate higher-ups has investors crying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ N.Y. , securities attorney : " Shareholders are being blindsided by corporate insiders because the SEC is turning a blind eye and letting them run wild with impunity . " <P> Like outside investors , corporate insiders are barred by securities laws from trading on information , such as earnings results and product announcements , before it is publicly released . To guard against abuses , top officers are subject to special regulation . They must , for example , report each of their trades to the SEC by the 10th of the following month . And they are subject to stiff fines and penalties for late filings.
