Shadows . Nuns sing Ave Maria Stella , a Benedictine chant , or some other medieval chant , perhaps without words , sung by one woman . It is quiet and beautiful . A thick carpet is unfolded , and set down . On each side of the carpet , facing each other , are set two wooden Gothic chairs . Light falls on the rug , shafts of light on the two chairs . Above them , a stained glass rose window appears . Enter Gerberga , Abbess of Gandersheim . She is a regal figure , in a white medieval cowl , with a surplice of scarlet over her black robes . With her is Brother William , a monk in a plain robe , whose hood hides his face . Gerberga walks with Brother William to one of the chairs and indicates that he may sit there . Then she moves , slowly , formally , to the other chair . They both sit . The Nuns stop singing . GERBERGA Most dearly beloved Brother William . Of all the nuns in this convent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bishop might consider questionable . She is a writer . She composes devotional poems , all of them above reproach . But she is also writing a play , based on pagan Roman models , and I can see how your Bishop , since he has heard of it , may be alarmed . Let us see if there is anything to be alarmed about . Will you hear our Sister describe her work ? ( Brother William nods . ) Sister . ( Enter Hrosvitha . She is composed but she is thrilled by this event . She stands above the rug , at its center , and speaks to Brother William. ) p. 3 HROSVITHA My play is called Abraham . It is written to be performed by the Sisters of the Convent , with music composed for it here . I will gladly tell you its story . It is very beautiful , since I wrote it for God and his glory , and I know that you will like it . ( She smiles , excited by her tale . ) Abraham is a hermit . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lights change . They bathe her in a warm storytale glow , and light the rug brightly . ) When she is a child , Mary 's parents die . Abraham adopts her . He builds a little cell for her , near his own , where he watches over her , hears her prayers and instructs her in divine law . ( Enter Mary , dressed in white and seen only by Hrosvitha . She kneels . ) Under his care , Mary becomes beautiful and devout . Abraham hears her prayers and her hymns every day , and thanks God for the happiness she gives him , for he wants her to enter a convent and become the bride of Christ . ( Enter Abraham , in a hermit 's robe , holding a cross . Over his back hang a cloak and a large-brimmed hat . He also is only seen by Hrosvitha . He kneels . ) " I am happy , " says Mary . " My Guardian Abraham means  --  " MARY  --  means everything to me . I love to worship and study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am happy , " says Abraham . " My niece Mary means  --  " p. 4 ABRAHAM  --  everything to me . I love to worship and study and pray and be near her . MARY I will always do whatever he says . ABRAHAM I will send her to God , in heaven . ( Mary turns her back . ) HROSVITHA One day , when Mary is seventeen years old , Abraham has a vision . ( Abraham moves in front of Hrosvitha , throws his arm in front of his eyes and kneels . ) ABRAHAM Ah ! ( Hrosvitha stands behind him , seeing his vision with him . ) HROSVITHA A huge , dragon-like monster , with a horrifying stench  --  ABRAHAM  --  rushes violently toward me ! He wants to eat a little dove I have tied to my wrist . ( He acts it out . ) He knocks me over , seizes my little bird in his jaws and devours it ! HROSVITHA Then he vanishes , in smoke ! ABRAHAM When I open my eyes , I am blind . I throw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhausted , I fall asleep . ( He does . ) HROSVITHA And he dreams he sees the beast again . But now , it is lying at his feet , no longer terrible or frightening . Just a huge , sleeping animal . p. 5 ABRAHAM And the dove is flying to heaven , safe and free ! I awake , weeping , and I can see again ! HROSVITHA He wonders what the vision means ! ABRAHAM Oh , the most awful uneasiness takes hold of me . Thinking of the monster asleep , and the dove free , I remember Mary , my little niece , my pupil . For three days , I have n't heard her praying or singing . HROSVITHA He goes to her cell ! He knocks at her window ! ( Abraham moves to an imaginary cell . ) ABRAHAM Mary ? My child ? Mary ? Why wo n't you answer me ? Mary ? HROSVITHA She 's gone ! ABRAHAM Mary ! ( He paces back and forth in anguish . ) What wolf has stolen my Mary ? What devil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a monk 's robe ? HROSVITHA He came to her with prayers and sugared words ! He made the girl fall in love with him ! ABRAHAM Mary , in love ? HROSVITHA He seduced her and he abandoned her ! When Mary realized what she had done , she tore her hair , dug her nails into her face and ran away ! p. 6 ABRAHAM Oh , Mary ! HROSVITHA She is gone , Abraham . ABRAHAM Where ? HROSVITHA Into the world . She has fallen . ABRAHAM Fallen ? How ? HROSVITHA It hurts me to tell you this . ABRAHAM Please ! HROSVITHA She lives in an inn , where she sells herself to strange men . ABRAHAM Strange men ? My Mary ? HROSVITHA It comes naturally to whores . There is nothing you can do . ABRAHAM There is ! I can go to that place ! HROSVITHA They wo n't let you in ! ABRAHAM If I pay them , they will ! As a lover they will let me in ! HROSVITHA That will break your vows ! ( He hands her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vows ! ( Abraham holds up a wide-brimmed hat that has been hanging from his shoulders , and spreads his cloak around his hermit 's robe . ) With my face hidden by this hat , and my robe by this cloak , I will go to that place and bring her back to me , and to God ! ( He turns away. ) p. 7 HROSVITHA Mary ! Come at once . You have a visitor . ( Mary turns around . She sweeps a colorful and sensuous shawl over her white dress . She moves down to the carpet . Abraham turns and comes onto the carpet . Hrosvitha , holding the cross , stands above and between them . ) MARY You wanted me ? ABRAHAM That 's right . I 've paid for you and for some women to sing for us . What 's your name ? MARY Mary . ABRAHAM Give me your hand , Mary . MARY Take off the hat , Mister . ABRAHAM Later . MARY You can keep it on in bed for all I care . ( Mary meets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand . ) ABRAHAM Mary ! MARY Oh ! ( Holding hands , they turn from each other . ) ABRAHAM My Mary ! HROSVITHA His hand is strong ! MARY What 's happening to me ? HROSVITHA He feels like silk ! ABRAHAM AND MARY Ah ! p. 8 HROSVITHA They remember happiness . ABRAHAM ( To himself . ) Talk to her ! Say something ! HROSVITHA He tries to play the lecher ! ABRAHAM So , what are we waiting for ? HROSVITHA She the whore ! MARY Nothing ! ( She turns away and weeps . ) ABRAHAM Now what 's the matter ? I want to go to bed with you , not watch you cry ! MARY I 'm all right now . A little thing moved me , very silly . Come on , my friend . Let 's go . ABRAHAM Where 's the bedroom ? MARY This way , Mister . ( Leading Abraham by the hand , Mary takes him in a circle . ) HROSVITHA She takes him by the hand ! They pass through a dark hallway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary leads Abraham to the center of the rug . ) MARY So lie down . ABRAHAM All right . ( He lies down on the carpet . ) HROSVITHA Music ! ( The slow and beautiful chant is heard again. ) p. 9 MARY Is that the music you want to hear ? ABRAHAM Yes . MARY While we make love , Mister ? ABRAHAM Yes . MARY No accounting for tastes . Well , you ready ? ABRAHAM Yes . ( Mary moves toward him , smiling . ) MARY Now I get to take off that hat ! ( Mary takes off his hat , and kisses him , eyes closed . Abraham does not move . Mary opens her eyes . She sees the face she is kissing . ) Oh ! ABRAHAM Mary ! It 's me ! I 'm here ! ( Mary throws herself down , away from him , head in her arms . ) MARY Oh ! Oh ! ABRAHAM Do n't you know me ? MARY God ! ABRAHAM The man who loved you ! Who wanted to marry you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ABRAHAM I bought you , remember ? You 're mine ! MARY Ah ! ( Mary curls up on the carpet , knees drawn up , arms over her head , crying. ) p. 10 ABRAHAM Who was he ? MARY Oh ! ABRAHAM Who did this to you ? A devil ? MARY No , a man ! ABRAHAM Why could n't you trust me ? MARY Oh ! ABRAHAM If you 'd told me , I would have prayed for you ! I would have done penance for you ! MARY Oh , stop ! ABRAHAM No one but Christ lived without sin ! We all sin ! We fall ! But we can repent , and rise again ! Mary ? MARY Go away ! ABRAHAM I love you ! MARY NO ! ! ABRAHAM What else but love could make me leave my cell , and break my vows ? What else but love could make me , a hermit of God , come to this dreadful place and act like a lascivious fool ? Mary , look at me ! MARY I ca n't ! ABRAHAM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Or I will take your sins upon me ! Anything ! I 've been a dead man without you ! ! ( The Nuns stop singing . Mary raises her head , and looks at Abraham . ) MARY I ca n't say no to you . I ca n't disobey you , or hurt you . ( She goes to his embrace , her head on his chest. ) p. 11 ABRAHAM Mary ! MARY I will come back to you ! I want to ! ( Abraham holds her in his arms . ) ABRAHAM I can see the window of your cell . That blessed place , where I come to see you every day . You smile at me and listen to me . MARY I pray and sing ! HROSVITHA She will do it all again ! ( Abraham stands , picks up his hat . Mary casts off her shawl . ) ABRAHAM I will take you to a convent , to be the bride of Christ . MARY Yes ! I want to go there ! Take me ! ( Hrosvitha steps between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Son of God , and to His Mother the Queen of Heaven , who will never abandon those they love ! Amen ! ABRAHAM AND MARY Amen ! ( Abraham takes the cross . Exit Abraham and Mary . The lights change again , back to what they were when Hrosvitha began her story . ) HROSVITHA That is the end of my play . There will be music and the Sisters playing the parts will leave the stage . GERBERGA So . Brother William ? ( No response . Gerberga gets up , walks about , thinking . ) I will admit , it 's not quite clear . A sinner , Mary , is returned to God . But how ? Under the persuasion of a holy man , who is a father to her , but who certainly does , like any other man , seduce her . This could suggest that women are seduced not only into sin and degradation but into sanctity and convents . And not just by holy men either , but by God , the greatest of Fathers . By Jesus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I can see how a Bishop would be upset . ( Gerberga looks at Brother William . No response . Gerberga goes and sits in her chair again . ) Brother William ? ( No response . ) Brother William ? Are you asleep , sir ? p. 12 BROTHER WILLIAM I am not asleep ! ( Brother William throws back his cowl , revealing his face . ) I have looked and I have listened . And I too am upset , but not about the play . HROSVITHA I am so relieved . My little play only echoes God 's great love ! BROTHER WILLIAM Your little play is hysterical female nonsense ! No one in their right mind could care about anything so ridiculous ! HROSVITHA Oh ! BROTHER WILLIAM But what is n't ridiculous , and what I have waited patiently to talk about , Gerberga of Gandersheim , is that music ! GERBERGA Music ? HROSVITHA Ave Maria Stella ? BROTHER WILLIAM A hymn to the Virgin , composed by you , which you will sing not only here , but outside your convent walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WILLIAM Your Bishop knows what you are doing . GERBERGA Brother William , do not speak to me like this . BROTHER WILLIAM He does n't like it ! GERBERGA Brother William , I beg you . p. 13 BROTHER WILLIAM Secure in your wealthy convent of Canoness Nuns , you think you are a law unto yourselves ! Your Bishop is deeply offended , and by you ! GERBERGA And I , by him . Gandersheim is a free Abbey , given me by my King and my Pope . Who do you think you are talking to ? BROTHER WILLIAM To a fool ! GERBERGA Why am I a fool ? BROTHER WILLIAM That music ! GERBERGA What about that music ? BROTHER WILLIAM It is blasphemous ! HROSVITHA Oh ! GERBERGA It is what ? BROTHER WILLIAM You compose your own chants . You play them on the harp , the psalterium and the trumpet ! Women , tooting trumpets to the glory of God ? It is obscene and it is grotesque ! In the words of the blessed Saint Paul : " Let the women keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep silent ? Because we sing better here , write better here , LIVE better here , than you morose ugly men , with your dismal chants and your eternal hankering for domination and revenge ? ( Brother William gets up . ) BROTHER WILLIAM You insolent and insubordinate nun ! You will write no more Ave Marias ! p. 14 GERBERGA ( Gets up . ) I will go to the King ! BROTHER WILLIAM And he will strip you of your authority ! GERBERGA I will write to the Pope ! HROSVITHA Please , stop ! BROTHER WILLIAM And he will empty all of Gandersheim ! Music in Church is for MEN and BOYS , as God 's Holy Scripture plainly decrees ! WOMEN ! WE sing the chants ! It is OUR voices and not YOURS that will be heard in the vaults of heaven ! WOMEN ! ! BE SILENT ! ! ( Exit Brother William . ) GERBERGA A mad monk . Really . ( Hrosvitha falls to her knees , weeping . ) HROSVITHA What have I done ? GERBERGA Nothing . HROSVITHA But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bishop , we would live like soldiers , not like sisters . Depend on me . I will not abandon you . Continue your work ! ( Hrosvitha kisses the hem of Gerberga 's robe . ) As for this play , well . It ca n't be performed now . We will bind it , and put it in the Library . If the future should wonder what we did here , it will find your plays here . You are surely the first Sister , and perhaps the first woman , ever to write a play . And I am the arrogant Nun who preserved it . Yes , I like that idea very much . ( Pause . Gerberga starts out . ) Of course , I do have a few criticisms . Some of that language is very harsh . Smooth it out . And Abraham ca n't say out loud that he wants a woman . Change that . He just goes to get her , that 's all . And that kissing . Do something about all that kissing ! Ugh ! ( Exit Gerberga. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the carpet , in frustration . ) OH ! ! ( She weeps . Lights change . Enter Abraham and Mary . They stand awkwardly watching her , looking at each other . ) OHHHHH ! ( They sit with her on the carpet . ) ABRAHAM What 's the matter ? MARY Why are you crying ? HROSVITHA Oh , be quiet ! MARY She does n't like us anymore . ABRAHAM Praise to the Son of God and the Queen of Heaven , who never abandon those they love . MARY Goodbye , stupid Abraham . ABRAHAM Goodbye , crazy Mary . ABRAHAM AND MARY Not very nice ! HROSVITHA Of course I love you ! I danced and sang when you came to life ! You know that ! ABRAHAM Then what 's wrong ! ( Pause . ) HROSVITHA That horrible monk called you nonsense . My mother in Christ says you must n't kiss . They do n't know who you are ! And neither do I ! ABRAHAM We are yours . MARY Just as you are God 's . He made you . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HROSVITHA ( Thinking it out . ) I do n't know . I tried to write about love  --  MARY How love brings us to God ! HROSVITHA What did you say ? ABRAHAM AND MARY How love brings us to God . HROSVITHA Maybe that 's what 's wrong . God is not always so simple , and love is not always so  --  beautiful . Go back ! ABRAHAM Where ? HROSVITHA I do n't know ! Father in Heaven ! Help me ! Abraham ! A huge , dragon-like monster ! ( Mary moves aside , kneels and prays . Abraham and Hrosvitha take up their positions at that moment in her play . ) ABRAHAM  --  rushes violently toward me ! He wants to eat a little dove I have tied to my wrist . He knocks me over , seizes my little bird in his jaws , and devours it ! HROSVITHA Then he vanishes , in smoke ! ABRAHAM When I open my eyes , I am blind . I throw myself into prayer , for two days . Then , exhausted , I fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . But now  --  ( Hrosvitha stares at Abraham. ) just a huge , sleeping animal . p. 17 ABRAHAM And the dove is flying to heaven , safe and free . ( Hrosvitha steps back . Abraham goes to Mary . ) Mary ? ( Mary is praying . ) Mary ! MARY Ah , Father Abraham ! I am praying . ABRAHAM You may interrupt your prayers . Come with me . MARY Where are we going ? ABRAHAM On a journey ? MARY Where ? ABRAHAM To another country . ( He puts on his hat and cloak , which disguise him . ) MARY Why are you doing that ? ABRAHAM So no one will see who I am . MARY But why ? ABRAHAM Hush . Trust in me . ( He takes her by the hand and they go into the brothel . He seats her on the carpet , and leaves her . Hrosvitha continues to rediscover her story . ) HROSVITHA He takes her to the brothel ! He pays a great deal of money to keep her there , for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shawl . Abraham moves away . ) She lives in the brothel . At first she still prays , but then she just waits , for his visits . ( Abraham goes to Mary . ) She is always glad to see him . ( Abraham creeps up behind her , puts his hand on over her eyes. ) p. 18 MARY Father Abraham ! ABRAHAM My darling Mary ! MARY It has been such a long time ! ABRAHAM Have you missed me ? MARY You know I have ! ABRAHAM Mary ! HROSVITHA Whorehouse ! Music ! Kiss ! ( The Nuns sing once more . Abraham and Mary throw themselves into each other 's arms , embrace wildly , and fall down on the carpet , kissing avidly . ) ABRAHAM AND MARY Ah ! Ah ! ( With his cloak lying over them , crying out in sexual pleasure , they make vigorous love . ) HROSVITHA Better ! ( There is a great of graphic pumping and heaving under the cloak , completed by a satisfying mutual orgasm , loudly proclaimed . ) The Beast devours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mary uncouple , and fall heavily away from each other , gasping until they get their breath . Then they look back at each other in amazement and fall back into each other 's arms . ) ABRAHAM Oh , God ! MARY How wonderful ! ABRAHAM I love you ! p. 19 MARY I love you ! ( Mary and Abraham lie exhausted together , in passionate contentment . ) HROSVITHA And lies there , a huge sleeping animal . ABRAHAM ( Groaning . ) Ahhh . MARY ( Groaning . ) Ohhhhh . HROSVITHA While the dove , safe and free , flies to heaven . MARY Ahhhh ! ABRAHAM Ohhhh ! ( Pause . The Nuns stop singing . ) Mary ? MARY Yes , my darling ? ABRAHAM I was a dead man without you . MARY ( Smiling . ) I remember . ABRAHAM I did not know what love was . MARY Neither did I. ABRAHAM It is the most wonderful thing in the world . ( Pause . ) But  --  ( He sighs . ) MARY But what ? ABRAHAM I may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Why not ? p. 20 ABRAHAM ( Shrugs . ) Money . MARY Money ? ABRAHAM To pay for you . Did n't you wonder where I got it ? MARY Sometimes . ABRAHAM I steal it . From churches , who let me in to pray . From fools , who trust holy men . An Abbot found me out . He wo n't condemn me , if we stop now . MARY And if we do n't ? ABRAHAM I leave the Church . Take you , and go live  --  in the world . MARY Oh . ABRAHAM Man and wife , like other people . ( Mary sits up , frowning . ) Would you like that ? MARY I 'm not sure . ABRAHAM To tell you the truth , as much as I adore you , I rather like living around men . The discipline , the prayers . Marriage and babies and listening to women , I do n't know . MARY Well , to tell you the truth , as much as I adore you , I like living with women . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know . ABRAHAM I guess it 's settled . MARY I guess it is. p. 21 ABRAHAM We have to decide what to do with you . MARY Do n't leave me here ! ABRAHAM I thought you liked it here . MARY They 'd put me in the bull pen . ABRAHAM Bull pen ? MARY Men standing in line . Ten , sometimes twenty an hour ! ABRAHAM Where do you want to go then ? HROSVITHA There is only one place . MARY Where women are . If not a whorehouse , a convent . HROSVITHA Of course . MARY Can you arrange it ? HROSVITHA I can . MARY Thank you , Abraham . ABRAHAM You 're welcome , Mary . ( They look fondly at each other . ) I will miss you . MARY I will miss you , too . ( Abraham reaches out to her . ) ABRAHAM I will pray for you . ( Mary takes his hand . ) MARY And I will pray for you . ( Hrosvitha moves between them , a hand on each shoulder. ) p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will live with women . ( To Abraham . ) You will become an Abbot . And I ? I will write more plays .
