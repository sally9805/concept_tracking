" The Auschwitz Circus , " in addition to being the inspiration for Kent Bash 's excellent cover and the catalyst for this issue , is also Matthew Wells ' first short fiction sale . The story began life as a one-act play , and was performed as part of an evening of ten-minute one-acts by various writers at A Theatre Company in New York City . <p> Matthew has made his living for the last twenty years acting and writing plays . His produced plays are too numerous to mention , but they include God 's Country , which was performed Off-Off Broadway in 1990 , The Goose Girl , done in Los Angeles at the Theatre of N. O. T.E , and Wildest Dreams , produced by Lightning Strikes at the Madison Avenue Theatre in New York . <p> It is 1938 . In a little church cemetery in Leonding , Adolf Hitler , one year away from invading Poland , is standing over the grave of his mother and father . He is thinking of his mother 's death , only a few days before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since . He is already planning to change the celebration of Christmas to a celebration of mother- hood , to change even the name of the holiday from Weihenacht to Mutternacht , from Holy Night to Mother Night . He barely notices the young woman in slacks who is also standing by a grave in the cemetery , but as she tums and looks at him , he does notice the look of joy and triumph in her face , just before she shoots him three times in the head . <p> " She 's obsessed with him , " says Nora 's husband Louis . <p> " Hitler , " says Phyllis . She looks at her brother and laughs nervously , which is the only way that she knows how to laugh . <p> Louis nods . " There 's this place . This museum in the Village . The PMS ? " <p> Phyllis screws up her face . " That 's the one , what , full of exhibits that never happened , right ?  --  the old Kennedy Museum ? " <p> Louis nods again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I already go to a place dedicated to things that never happened ; it 's called the inside of my head . And you know me  --  why go anywhere else when I can get it at home for free . " <p> " Well , Nora goes to the PMS . " <p> " Nora has no imagination . " <p> " She goes there all the time . " <p> " How often is all the time ? " <p> " Two , three times a week . Right after work . Sometimes on the weekends . On the second floor , it 's called the Alternate Reality floor , they have these , I do n't know , they 're like game rooms . She goes to this one room . The Hitler Room . Because in the Hitler Room , you get to kill Hitler . Before he becomes Hitler . You get to change the course of history . " <p> November 9th , 1923 , and Adolf Hitler is driving like a madman in a red Fiat to the Lake Staffel country home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his left shoulder , which has been dislocated and fractured by the weight of the man who fell on it not an hour ago , the man he linked arms with just before the police opened fire on them all in front of the Odeonsplatz in Munich . For the next two days he will hide in the Hanfstaengl attic under a couple of blankets and threaten to commit suicide , until finally he tums himself in to the Bavarian police on the 11th of November . He will be sentenced to five years in prison ; he will serve less than nine months . <p> Hitler glances nervously in his rear view mirror . He half expects to see the motor cars of the police screaming into view behind him as he drives south . What he sees instead is the eyes of the young woman who has been hiding in the back seat , the young woman who is even now swooping forward and looping a length of piano wire around his neck and saying over and over again in English : " Die , you son of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she ? " asks Phyllis . <p> " Does she what ? " <p> " Change the course of history ? <p> Louis looks at the ceiling . " I do n't know . I do n't think so . " <p> " Why not ? " <p> " Because she keeps going back . " <p> It is 1907 . Hitler has just been rejected by the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna . The two required drawings that accompany his portfolio , one on the expulsion of Adam and Eve from Paradise and one on any incident connected with the legend of Noah 's Ark , have been rejected because they have , in the words of one examiner , " too few heads . " Nora pictures the future dictator of Germany fuming wandering the streets of Vienna , imagining pyramids of heads , mountains of heads , oceans of heads , all of them Jewish . Instead , she finds him talking with a Mend in an outdoor cafe , complaining about the professors at the Art Academy , expressing worry about his mother , who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table . " Excuse me , " she says in flawless German , " but are you Adolf Hitler ? " <p> The serious young man stares up at her . " Ja . . . " <p> " I have something for you , " she says , and reaches into her purse . Before his friend can stop her , she buries a knife into Hitler 's belly and begins to carve . <p> " She keeps going back , " says Louis . " And I do n't know why . " <p> Phyllis looks at her brother like he 's missing the obvious . " Maybe she likes it , " she says , because she knows through experience that the only reason why people do anything more than once is because they like it . Even the things they say they hate  --  if they do it more than once , then deep down , they really like it . " I mean , " says Phyllis , " given the chance , would n't you do what she 's doing ? I mean I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't change anything " says Louis . " How could she think it would change anything ? " <p> Phyllis knows from the way her brother has asked the question that he is n't looking for an answer , he 's just trying to understand his wife ; but she tries to give him an answer anyway . She thinks for a moment about killing Adolf Hitler before he comes to power in Germany ; thinks about how she would do it . A gun ? A knife ? Explosives ? And she realizes that she does n't know the first thing about where to find Hitler before , say , 1939 ; or what he looks like . So how does Nora know that ? <p> " Maybe it does n't change just anything " Phyllis says slowly . " Maybe it just changes Nora . " And that , she realizes , that , she can understand . <p> " Oh it 's changed her , all right , " says Louis . <p> " He thinks I 'm crazy , " says Nora . <p> Im shaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes with the territory . " Nora shrugs . " Well , maybe not actually crazy . I mean the weird thing is that he does n't argue with the principle behind what I 'm doing . He just does n't think it 's right for me . Sort of like saying , I do n't have anything against smoking  --  just as long as you do n't do it . " <p> " So he 's contradicting himself . " <p> " Oh yeah . It 's typical . " <p> " Maybe if you showed him what the Hitler Room was like ? " <p> " I 've tried . I mean he 's only ever been in the Museum once . And he got himself thrown out . " <p> " Thrown out ? Why ? " <p> " Well , we were in one of the Kennedy exhibits , the Grassy Knoll ? - where you get to be a part of everything , and take pictures ? " <p> " You actually got tickets to that ? " It 's the single most popular room in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack the Ripper and the Little Big Horn . <p> " I bought the tickets a year in advance . For his birthday . I mean he 's a Kennedy nut , he 's into all the theories , and I figured , well this is great  --  he gets to be there , he gets to see it for himself  --  he 'll love it . Well , let me tell you . . . " <p> " What happened ? " <p> " The minute he saw the motorcade , the minute it rounded the comer in front of the Book Depository , he was running out into the street yelling stop , stop , there 's a guy with a gun , there 's a guy with a rifle . And the motorcade screeches to a halt , and Louis is pointing all over the place , and the next thing you know there 's Secret Service everywhere , and they 've got two gunmen in the book depository , one guy behind us on the grassy knoll , and one guy under a manhole cover in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He mined it for everybody . " <p> Nora sighs . " He said later , how can you go and just watch ? And I said , that 's the point . Watching is the point . And he says , oh yeah ? Do you just go back and watch Hitler ? Which is apples and oranges , and I tell him this , and he 's shaking his head saying no , no , no , no , the point is , if you can go back , you do n't just watch . You do something . " <p> I know what he means . I 've killed Hitler . I 've been a member of the PMS since the Seventies , when the Hitler Room was my home away from home . I 've killed Hitler hundreds of times . And it was never enough . Because it 's not about the one who gave the orders , and it 's not about the ones who pulled the trigger , and it 's not even about the people who died . It 's about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people in Krakow who watched the Germans take my grandmother away . Who just sat there , and did nothing , like it was some kind of performanee ; like they were only the audience . It was n't just the Germans who killed her  --  it was the people who did nothing . And I never realized that , until I went looking for my grandmother . And found the Auschwitz Circus . <p> Nora asks : " How old was she ? " <p> " Thirty , " I say . <p> " My grandparents were in their forties . " <p> There is a moment when we just sit there on the museum bench , the granddaughters of women who died when they were younger than we are now . <p> I try to picture the scene . A black-and-white street in Krakow . A building . Soldiers at the door . <p> " What are you doing ? " <p> " Victoria Berkovits ? " <p> " What do you want ? " <p> Maybe they tell her she is to be relocated . Maybe they tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We just have a few questions to ask you , Fraulein . " Questions about your father the Rabbi . Questions about your sister , your daughter . " Just a formality , Fraulein . " <p> They drag her into the street . I try to picture the crowd . Black-and-white people . Silent . Staring . Saying to themselves : " That 's Victoria . That 's my friend Victoria . I know her . And she knows me . " And they rum away . Knowing what is happening to her , and convincing themselves that , whatever is happening to her ( and they have no idea what it is ) , it is only what she deserves . <p> And what is my grandmother thinking about ? Every time I picture it , I get a different answer . Sometimes , she is thinking of her daughter . My mother . Who is with her sister . My aunt . On her way to America . Sometimes she is thinking of my grandfather , two years dead as she is dragged down the steps of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is thinking about her neighbors . Her friends . All of them peering at her behind closed windows , behind raised blinds . Peering and doing nothing . Saying nothing . As she is forced into the back of a truck . Does she go quietly ? Does she yell and scream ? Does she say what I would have said ? <p> Nora says : " Treblinka . " <p> I say : " Auschwitz . " <p> The way we say it is like two strangers shaking hands . <p> Christmas Eve , 1918 . The War To End All Wars has ended , and Adolf Hitler lies half blind and seething in a military hospital in Pasewalk outside Berlin . He is raging against the November criminals , the November traitors who have betrayed the Motherland . He can see their faces even without the use of his eyes . They are all Jewish . They are all laughing at him , laughing at his rotten teeth and his Iron Cross . And he knows that the reason they are laughing at him is because they are afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regains his sight , he will dedicate himself to ridding the world of every last one of them , a deed the rest of the world will surely allow him to perform , because it is their secret desire , the one they are not strong enough or honest enough to express in tull view of the world , as he is . Yes , he thinks , the Jews , he thinks , and he begins to mutter to himself the words of a speech that he could give , a speech that will rouse all of Germany to his side , from the lowliest peasant to the smiling nurse by his bedside who is even now leaning down over him with a pillow in her hands , a pillow that slowly smothers him , a pillow as soft and white as the snow on the cemetery where his mother is buried . <p> " Will you stop ? " says Louis . <p> " Stop what ? " <p> Louis gestures . " This , " he says . <p> Nora starts to say , " This what ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She sighs . Pick your fights , she says to herself . You 've finally convinced him to come with you to the Museum , so that has to be the absolute last thing you start fighting about . At least today . <p> They are in the PMS Cafe , in the Garden Room . The PMS Cafe has been a Village fixture since it opened its doors in 1967 and instantly became one of the flagship cabarets in the rise of Off-Broadway theater , producing a number of lost and unwritten plays like Sheridan 's Gallantry , Shakespeare 's Love 's Labour 's Won , and Marlowe 's The Maid 's Holiday , the posters for which are hanging behind Louis and Nora 's table . <p> Louis gestures again . " Why are you doing this ? " <p> " Because it 's the only thing I can do . " <p> " Nora , it does n't change anything . " <p> " Of course it does . It changes everything . " <p> " Will it bring anybody back to life ? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louis snorts . But he pays the check , and lets Nora lead him into the Museum . <p> The PMS is not an easy place to find . It 's on the corner of West Tenth and West Fourth , which in any other city but New York would be impossible . <p> Under its original name of the Camelot Hotel , the museum was founded in 1964 and privately funded by anonymous donations from the Kennedy family , who wanted it to be a living shrine to lost innocence , unrealized potential , and the bright future that was forever lost in Dallas in 1963 . As a result , nobody ever called it the Camelot Hotel ; everybody referred to it as the Kennedy Museum , or the Kennedy Place , the name by which it is still known among the older denizens of the Village . <p> By the end of the Sixties , the ivy-covered walls of the museum contained the most comprehensive collection in the world of exhibits , photographs , and records of things that never did happen , never could happen , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance  --  as you enter , on your left , opposite the doorway to The PMS Cafe , you will see the very popular Point Of No Return Exhibit . Here you 'll find President Bill Clinton actually saying , " No ; sorry , " to a half-naked woman . Here also is Nixon burning the Watergate tapes on the White House lawn ; George Armstrong Custer yelling : " Run away , run away ; " and , of course , John F. Kennedy saying : " Fuck it , I 'm sleeping in today . " <p> In 1984 , as part of its 20th Anniversary celebration , the museum went through extensive remodeling and officially changed its name to The Post Modem Salon and began marketing itself under the motto : " Three floors . No reality . " ( Actually it has four floors  --  three floors and a mezzanine  --  but the mezzanine is impossible to find . ) <p> And as part of the remodeling , the entire second floor was redesigned to become the heart , of the new museum . Alternate Reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Floor , " says the guide . He points to his right . " Over the doorway , at the head of the stairs ?  --  that 's a picture of John Lennon 's fiftieth birthday party . " As usual , this announcement gets a couple of low moans . " Third guy on the left , that 's Jimi Hendrix . " <p> More moans . Louis shakes his head . Nora holds his arm . <p> " There are , " says the guide , " over fifty rooms on the second floor . Each dedicated to a different theme . For instance , over here is the Off-White House . This is where you 'll find President George Armstrong Custer ; President Aaron Burrs President Michael Dukakis . And my personal favorite , President George S. Patton . " <p> Louis is standing under a dark television set . " What 's this ? " he asks . <p> " Ah , " says the guide . " That 's the Malcolm X American Express commercial . " He switches on the television with a remote control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ X , in a dark suit , with a graying beard , sitting alone in a plush banquette . <p> " Do you know me ? " he asks . " Back in the Sixties , I called the Kennedy assassination just another case of chickens coming home to roost . But these days , when I eat my chicken at Lutece , I use the American Express card . Because when I pick up a check , I do it by any means necessary . " <p> A deep announcer 's voice : " Cardmember since 1968 . " <p> The television clicks off . <p> " And this , " says the guide , " is the very popular Hitler Room . " <p> It is December , 1907 . There is snow on the ground . Hitler 's mother is being buried in a small cemetery in Leonding . Nora points out the future leader of Germany , and hides behind Louis as she takes a gun out from under her sweater . <p> Louis looks around , worried . " Nora . There are people watching . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything ; they 're Germans . " She hands Louis the gun . " Here . Go ahead . You do it . " <p> " What ? " <p> " Go ahead  --  kill him . " <p> Louis looks around nervously . The priest is saying something in German . Everyone is standing with their heads down . Nora is whispering egging him on . He shushes her . People start staring at them . Especially Hitler , anger in his eyes . <p> The anger makes it easier . Louis looks into Hitler 's eyes and sees a black chimney of smoke boiling up into a gray sky and without thinking he shoots Hitler twice in the chest , then twice in the stomach , then he walks over to the writhing body and puts the fifth bullet between Hitler 's eyes . <p> As Nora predicts , the people around them just watch . <p> " Jesus , " says Louis . He wipes the sweat from his eyes ; he feels like he has just spent an hour in a steam room . " Jesus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says . <p> " You want a rush , " says Nora , " you should try killing him at the Nuremberg Rally . " <p> Louis looks at her like a little boy who has just been handed a new toy . " Can I ? " <p> Nora smiles . <p> Over the next few weeks , Louis does nothing but kill Hitler . <p> " It 's not enough , " he says . <p> He branches out . He kills everyone in the German High Command . He kills their parents , their lovers , their children , their wives . <p> " It 's still not enough . " <p> He shoots the generals . He murders the soldiers . He hangs the lager Kommandants . Hoss . Kramer : Baer . Goth . Weiss . Ziereis . Stangl . He butchers the executives at I.G. Farben who set up their own work camp as part of Auschwitz . Durrfeld . Tesch . Ter Meet . Schmitz . Eisfeld . <p> And it still is n't enough . <p> " Why is n't it enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not just them , " says Louis . " It 's everybody . Everybody who stood around and did nothing . " <p> A smile grows on Nora 's face . " You really believe that ? " <p> " Yes . I do . " <p> Nora 's smile gets bigger . It is the smile of a little girl who knows a secret , and knows its power . " Then I have something you have to see , " she says . " Then I have something to show you . " <p> In the back of the Second Floor , last room on the right , is the Auschwitz Circus . <p> The first thing you see is a set of pictures . Pictures taken by Roman Vishniacin the Forties . Pictures of old people . Pictures of crowded ghettoes . <p> And what happens in these pictures , what happens in the room , is that people are taken out of their homes in broad daylight , in front of their neighbors , in front of their friends . Taken out of their homes , past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and piled into hot , sweaty , overcrowded boxcars with no food and no water . From homes all over Europe , these people are sent hundreds of miles away to a distant railroad station , in conditions of unspeakable degradation . <p> And when they arrive at this railroad station , which gets between ten and fifteen train loads a day , they are unloaded and pushed into line and driven past a chamber orchestra playing Rossini overtures , they 're pushed and shoved by guards with dogs and guns down the Himmelstrasse , a long dark tunnel with barbed wire on the walls and ceiling , they 're yelled at and barked at and kicked all the way into a huge big top , where the guards throw off their coats and become clowns , the children are given candy , the old men are given food ; and the Auschwitz Circus does three shows a day . <p> And all the people lucky enough to get in , they have a number stamped on their left arm , so they can leave and come back for free whenever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later . <p> The door is never closed , The gates are always open . The show never ends . <p> The Auschwitz Circus . <p> Louis watches the soldiers as they clear the streets of people . " You mean there are no concentration camps ? " <p> In the background , the soldiers herd them away . <p> " No . " Nora smiles . " No , there are . Thousands of them . All across the continent . " <p> Herd them all away , the silent racists , the willfully blind . <p> " But in the world of the Auschwitz Circus , all the death camps have been built for the people who do nothing . " <p> The ones who heard and did n't care . The ones who knew and let it happen . The ones who saw and smiled inside . <p> " They 're the ones who go to the gas chamber . The ones who look the other way , and do nothing . " <p> In the background , the soldiers lead them all to darkness . The guilty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of America . <p> And Nora and Louis smile , and look , and do nothing . <p> * * * <p> When I think of Louis , I think of what he said to his wife in the Dallas Room . He said to her , " How can you go and just watch ? The point is , if you can go back , you do n't just watch . You do something . " <p> I think of Louis a lot . And I think of what he 's doing now . I never met Louis . But I 've seen him . I see him all the time . He 's the one on the Second Floor with the camera in his hand , the one taking pictures of the soldiers of the Auschwitz Circus as they march the accomplices of abomination to a fate that no one deserves , not even the guilty . <p> Nora ? I still see Nora , now and then . We say hello but we do not talk , not the way we used to , the way we used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still as angry as the day I met her , still hates as passionately , with a pure white flame . I wonder how she does it . The fire of anger is a righteous fire , but you ca n't just light it and expect it to live forever . Time , like a steady rain , drizzles it to death , washes it away until nothing is left but the cold comfort of forgiveness . It 's a fire , after all . You have to feed it to keep it burning . And sometimes I think Nora is keeping hers alive by feeding it the one thing she ca n't afford to lose . Her life . <p> I do n't have time for that anymore . When I go to the PMS , I always go to the Second Floor , but it 's where I go to think . It 's where I go to reflect . And it 's where I go to see my grandmother . <p> " Victoria ? " <p> She comes out of the dark , she comes out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> She sits next to me . Hugging me . Smelling of flowers . <p> " And who is this ? " she says to the little boy beside me . <p> " This is Zachary , " I say . " Zachary , " I say , " this is your great-grandmother . " <p> " Hello , Zachary , " she says , and gives him a little kiss on the forehead . " This is for you , " she says , and hands him a big red balloon . She looks up at me . " He 's beautiful , " she whispers . <p> " Balloon , " says Zachary . <p> There are tears in my eyes . When I wipe them away , my grandmother has Zachary cradled in her arms . " If you like balloons , " she says to Zachary , " you 're going to love the clowns . " <p> And she reaches out to take my hand as we head down the hall to the Auschwitz Circus . <p> <p> By Matthew Wells <p>    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
