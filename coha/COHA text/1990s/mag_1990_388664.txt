Section : JAWS XII <p> In 1986 Roger Eddy , a gentleman farmer , novelist , and former state senator , was preparing to be the Republican challenger to U.S. Senator Christopher J. Dodd ( D. , Conn . ) . Accordingly , Eddy traveled to Washington to pay court to Connecticut 's other senator , Lowell P. Weicker Jr . <p> Weicker was amiable , cordial , expansive , and encouraging . Eddy , surprised by the performance , quickly decided to capture it for posterity . Planting himself on a nearby stair , Eddy jotted down a sketch of Weicker 's free-flowing monologue . Some time later Eddy used those notes to reconstruct the scene in a newspaper essay , capturing perfectly the genius and the folly of the man many Connecticut Republicans love to loathe . <p> " Let me tell you this , " Weicker began . " I have already informed the press that I plan to act as your statewide chairman . And now I am telling you that I plan to campaign up and down and across the entire state on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you , and I hope you know what that means . Because when Lowell Weicker goes all out for somebody , he goes all out . <p> " And let me tell you something else . You are going to win . <p> " I know what some of these so-called experts have been telling you around Washington  --  how you do n't have a chance and all that baloney . Because I 'm telling you that you are going to win . <p> " And why are you going to win ? Because I 'm going to campaign for you-that 's why . <p> " But you 've got to run a perfect campaign . And I know about perfect campaigns . I know more about running perfect campaigns than anyone in Connecticut . Hell , I know more about running perfect campaigns than anyone in America . I have run three perfect campaigns . I 've never been connected with a campaign that has n't been perfect . <p> " Let me tell you something . Just let me tell you something that a lot of people do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Lowell Weicker shooting from the hip . Right ? Well , I never shoot from the hip . Everything I do is planned down to the last detail . Every word I say is planned and timed to perfection . Every gesture I make is planned . I have never shot from the hip in my life .... <p> " And let me say this once more . You have Lowell Weicker 's total and complete support . I am behind you , my friend , 100 per cent . " <p> A few weeks after this unconditional statement Weicker was asked by reporters for the New London Day to assess Eddy 's chances , Weicker responded that anyone who supposed Eddy capable of defeating Dodd " ought to have his head examined . " <p> Weicker 's words were planned , and his gesture was deliberate . He was not shooting from the hip . And Dodd defeated Eddy by a 2 to I margin . Scrambling to the Top <p> A big fish in Connecticut 's small Republican pond , Weicker discovered early that the most effective way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guppies . <p> Starting from his plush home base of Greenwich , Weicker set out to confront the world . He served Greenwich as first selectman from 1962 to 1968 , and by all accounts was a capable administrator . Meanwhile , he represented the town in the state House of Representatives . <p> In 1968 he sought election to Congress as a conservative from Connecticut 's 4th District . The Democratic incumbent , Don Irwin , had annoyed conservatives by supporting President Lyndon Johnson 's Great Society and had alienated liberals by supporting Johnson 's prosecution of the Vietnam War . <p> Running as a " law and order " candidate , Weicker pummeled Irwin from the right , calling him " the permissive politician " and accusing him of opposing or failing to vote on legislation against draft-card burning and federal aid to student rioters . <p> As Election Day drew near , Weicker 's strategists saw that an independent candidate , Morris Earl , running on an antiwar platform , was gaining support . To prevent a split vote that might have secured a plurality for Irwin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) unleashed his " October surprise " he endorsed an immediate halt to U.S. bombing in Southeast Asia . Then , to smooth the feathers of his hawkish supporters , he invited California Governor Ronald Reagan to campaign for him , and won the election with 53 per cent of the vote . <p> In 1970 the Connecticut Republican Party tapped him to run for the U.S. Senate seat held by Thomas J. Dodd . Dodd was vulnerable , because of his continued support of our Vietnam involvement ( now under President Nixon ) , and because he had been censured by the Senate in 1967 for misappropriating campaign money . The Democrats were divided , eventually nominating an antiwar candidate , the Reverend Joseph Duffey , who had led Eugene McCarthy 's presidential campaign in Connecticut in 1968 ; Dodd stayed in the race as an independent . <p> In a debate among the three candidates , Weicker , seizing on an ironic jest Duffey had made during the 1968 campaign , called the latter a " one-man bomb and orgy squad . " Then he turned scornfully toward Dodd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " is belied by his censure . " <p> The Nixon Administration , which had clandestinely used money from a slush fund to support Weicker 's campaign , chortled from afar as he was elected with 42 per cent of the vote . <p> This Senate campaign taught Weicker the value of mobility . A politician who traveled light , unencumbered by ideological ballast , could go far in an environment in which more substantial politicians like Dodd sank . <p> It was Watergate that made Lowell Weicker a national champion of political rectitude . At a hearing of the Senate Watergate committee on June 28 , 1973 , Weicker proclaimed : " Republicans do not cover up do not threaten , do not commit illegal acts . And God knows , Republicans do n't view their fellow Americans as enemies to be harassed , but rather , I can assure you , Republicans look upon every American as a human being to be loved and won . " <p> When Ronald Reagan defeated Jimmy Carter for the Presidency in 1980 , the loving senior senator from Connecticut hunkered down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The worst thing that happened to us here in Connecticut , " Weicker said in 1982 , " was when we cast our votes for Ronald Reagan rather than Jimmy Carter . " <p> Connecticut Republicans did not feel that way , and they began to suspect that their senior senator had become in effect a liberal Democrat . Indeed , in 1983 Weicker was one of only five Senate Republicans to vote for the repeal of income-tax indexing and the 10 per cent tax cut . In May of that year he joined six Republican mutineers to oppose funding and deployment of the MX missile . In 1985 he joined five other Republicans in voting against the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Deficit Reduction Act . And in July of that year he was one of two Republican senators to support a successful filibuster against the line-item veto . <p> There was more : <p>  --  When even leading Democrats like Ted Kennedy supported the air strike against Libya 's Muammar Qaddafi , Weicker protested that the U.S. action " was no different than what Qaddafi had done " in masterminding the terrorist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after 125,000 tired , wretched , and poor people had fled Cuba for Miami , Weicker praised Fidel Castro for having delivered " a quality of life to those people that they have never known before . By Caribbean and South American standards , it 's Park Avenue . " When the Reagan Administration later proposed to broad cast a little truth to Cuba , Weicker led a filibuster against Radio Marti and later delayed funding for the Voice of America , Radio Liberty , and Radio Free Europe . <p>  --  Weicker 's ADA rating climbed sharply , from 30 per cent in 1971 to 90 per cent in the mid Eighties . <p> During all of this Weicker had discouraged rebellion at home by patiently explaining that for a Republican to succeed in the current political climate he had to tack to the left , since Connecticut 's voters were mostly Democrats and unaffiliated . Indeed , when Prescott Bush Jr . ( George 's brother ) challenged him in 1982 , Weicker produced polls showing that while Bush could beat him in a Republican primary , Bush could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Republican convention accepted his reasoning , Bush withdrew from the race , and the Democratic challenger , Representative Toby Moffett , found it impossible to pierce Weicker 's armor-plated left side , the only side Moffett attacked . So Weicker went back to Washington , wondering why the folks back home could n't understand that Republicans could not win statewide office in Connecticut running as principled Republicans . <p> The blowhard whom Roger Eddy visited in Washington in 1986 was the only Republican who had won statewide office in twenty years . And , having installed his former aide , Thomas d'Amore , as state Republican chairman , Weicker was now in a position to keep any other Connecticut Republican from reaching a position of eminence . But Weicker seemed to sense that the party was close to rebelling . <p> So at the Republican state convention that year , Weicker 's people pressed for ( and won ) a change in party rules to allow unaffiliated voters to vote in Republican primaries for major nominations . The rule change seemed designed mainly to prevent the Republican Party from ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The winner of the Republican primary for governor that year was state Representative Julie Belaga of Westport , whom Weicker had supported enthusiastically for the nomination . Alas , just as the general-election campaign began , the senator was disabled by a pinched nerve . He recovered only enough to praise the Democratic incumbent , William A. O'Neill , for having done a good job . Seemingly with Weicker 's approval , Governor O'Neill overwhelmed Representative Belaga . <p> But in 1988 Weicker found himself opposed by a Democrat who was a student of Connecticut politics : state Attorney General Joseph Lieberman . While this Democrat was as liberal as the others Weicker had vanquished , he was prepared to launch an enveloping attack  --  from the left , from the center , and , crucially , from Weicker 's long-exposed right side . <p> Lieberman attacked Weicker for his macho socializing with Fidel Castro and his apologizing for Communist Cuba . He criticized Weicker for opposing the U.S. military intervention in Grenada . <p> Then Lieberman bored in on Weicker 's record of performing the job he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missed Senate votes because he was off giving paid speeches to special-interest groups , collecting substantial fees from military contractors , corporations , and groups like the State of Israel Bonds Committee . One of the special interests that paid Weicker for speaking engagements was the Fertilizer Institute . Many Republicans thought this connection was especially appropriate , since Weicker had once called himself " the turd in the Republican punchbowl . " <p> Then BuckPac opened for business . This group , organized by William F. Buckley Jr . and his family , pledged to " liberate Connecticut , and Congress , from Lowell Weicker . " BuckPac gave Weicker fits , and it may have been a crucial factor in the campaign by legitimizing conservative and Republican support for Lieberman , who won by the slim margin of ten thousand votes out of nearly 1.4 million cast . <p> Weicker was slow to concede , but when he did , he was gracious . He said he had promised himself long ago that when the time came for him to leave the Senate , his exit would be dignified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unbowed , Weicker was departing the political stage forever . The New Sphinx <p> Well , not quite forever . After Governor O'Neill announced his retirement , Weicker bounded back upon the political stage in March as an independent candidate for governor , having realized that he had probably lost his hold on the Republican Party . <p> The early polls showed Weicker with an overwhelming lead , with about 40 per cent support . The likely Republican nominee , U.S. Representative John G. Rowland , is in second place with 14 per cent . The leading Democratic candidate , U.S. Representative Bruce Morrison , trails with 9 per cent . <p> Weicker 's lead seems to have numbed his formerly irrepressible tongue . Having once been willing to volunteer an opinion on everything , Weicker now can hardly be forced to disclose an opinion on anything . <p> Even the friendly press is showing signs of skepticism . When Weicker said that he would unveil his tax policy two months after his inauguration , one newspaper proposed postponing the election that long to give him time to tell the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . <p> Occasionally an energetic reporter will ask him a serious question : for example , will he support an increasingly popular movement to abolish Connecticut 's binding-arbitration system , which deprives municipal governments of the power to control their biggest expenses , the cost of public employees ? <p> Weicker will not stand still for such questions . He will not be bound . <p> But by November , the voters may have decided that they are not bound to cast their votes for Roger Eddy 's staunch supporter . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) <p> By Don Pesci <p> <p> Mr. Pesci , of the Manchester ( Connecticut ) Journal Inquirer , has been described by Mr. Weicker as " my favorite conservative political columnist .
