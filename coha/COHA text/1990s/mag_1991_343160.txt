In an interview with ' s Dean Fischer and another magazine correspondent in Riyadh last Friday , General Norman Schwarzkopf reviewed the allied campaign , including the surprise flanking movement of 150,000 troops into western Iraq . Highlights : <P> Colin Powell and I understood very early on that a strategic bombing campaign in and of itself had never ever won a war and had never forced $ anybody to do anything if they wanted to sit it out . I do n't think we ever believed exclusively that that would be it . So therefore we had already started talking about a ground campaign . <P> In one of my very first briefings with the President , we discussed ejecting Iraq from Kuwait . I gave the President terrible advice because I told him that in order to do the job , I needed about five times more force than I ended up getting , and that it would probably take about seven or eight months longer than it actually took to do the job . By the middle of October , we had a completely robust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a gnat 's eyelash . We went back to Washington to brief the President , and we were told , " Oh , by the way , brief the ground plan at the same time . " The ground campaign left everybody saying " umm , gee , uh , " because my assessment as commander was you ca n't get there from here . So then the decision was made to send over the remainder of the forces . <P> If you go back and look at the battle of El Alamein , where Montgomery defeated Rommel , one of the things the British did extremely well was a deception operation that caused the Germans to think that the main attack was going to come someplace else . I remembered that . Way back in August we had launched the amphibious-landing deception plan . So when I saw the way he had stuck all of his forces in this one bag down there , I started thinking . I was worried about the barrier they were building ( ( in southern Iraq ) ) and the troops they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for our troops to go in there and get hung up on the wire and have chemicals dumped on them . Every morning I had that map in my office . I was watching that obstacle system , and it was right across the tri-border area , and it was getting thicker and thicker and heavier and heavier , but it was n't going any further out to the west . So I remembered the fact that in desert warfare you can deceive your enemy as to the point of the main attack , and I said that 's it , that 's the key . <P> Let me tell you why we succeeded . Superb equipment . When you stop and consider that our tanks and armor traveled 200 miles in a period of two days , O.K. , I was confident that we could travel those great distances before the enemy could react . I am sure that at one point somebody said , What about this great big open flank over there ? , and the Iraqi generals or Saddam Hussein said , Hey , nobody could drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaking down and their equipment going to hell . They 'll never make it .
