<p> Seventh-grade summer camp was the last straw for Abbie Prentiss . " The food was so gross , " recalls the high school junior , that she decided to become a vegetarian . <p> At home , red meat was the first to go . Seafood and chicken followed . ( During a chicken dissection class the year before , " I found out what I was really eating , " Abbie says . ) Abbie 's mom , Candyce , gave up trying to get her daughter to eat chicken . <p> When it comes to the carnivorous lifestyle , more teens may be putting their steak knives away . According to a recent survey by Teenage Research Unlimited , 40 percent of teenage girls agree that being a vegetarian is " in . " ( Only 16 percent of boys agreed . ) <p> So , are they just picky eaters , or are they trying to be ' politically correct ' ? <p> " Parents sometimes see this as rebellion , " says Sally Clinton , founder of the nonprofit Vegetarian Education Network . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people can do - drugs , gangs . Being a vegetarian is a positive one . " <p> Dakota Prosch , an intern at the Network 's magazine , " How On Earth ! " adds , " Vegetarianism seems to be one sustainable answer for a lot that 's going on . Different movements have all led to this compassionate lifestyle - civil rights , feminism , animal rights - they all have to do with respect for life . " <p> And where are kids getting all these ideas ? The higher profile of animal-rights groups and the volume of information on healthy eating are factors . <p> C. J. Valenziano of the National Cattlemen 's Beef Association thinks Americans are confused by the conflicting messages about diet . People are just starting to understand that one type of food does n't necessarily have a dramatic impact on your health , Ms. Valenziano says . <p> Lest barbequing dads fear abandonment by their kids at the family cookout , note that acknowledging a trend is one thing , following it is another . In a 1995 Roper poll conducted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 17-year-old girls said they never eat meat , the same percentage as two surveys of British children and double the percentage of boys who abstain . <p> While 11 percent is nowhere near the 40 percent of girls who note the popularity of vegetarianism , the numbers are still significant because they are nearly double the number of adults who are self-described vegetarians . <p> " Girls are allowed to be more sensitive , to be in touch with their feelings , and to feel the plight of animals , " Ms. Clinton says . " Then there are other stereotypes : Guys think eating meat makes you macho . " Also an issue is girls ' preoccupation with their looks due to exaggeratedly thin women portrayed in the media . Such images may influence youngsters to opt for lower-calorie diets . <p> Among adults , women outnumber male vegetarians by only a couple of percentage points . Studies estimate that between 5 and 7 percent of all Americans call themselves vegetarian , but only about 1 percent abstain from any meat , fish , or fowl . Even fewer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dairy products and sometimes honey . <p> And USDA figures say Americans ' per capita consumption of meats , poultry , and seafood has long been rising . Even as beef sales declined in the late 1980s and early 1990s , ( sales are now on the upswing ) , Americans seem to be replacing the beef in their diets with other animal foods . <p> So while many more adults as well as teens may be comfortable calling themselves vegetarians , they are n't necessarily strict about their practice . That 's also what makes them so hard to count . Trend spotters see a mainstreaming of the concept . <p> " It 's a whole different world out there , " says Jennie Collura of The North American Vegetarian Society . " The reaction now is , ' Oh , I understand who you are and what you do . ' It used to be , ' You 're a what ? ' " <p> Analysis of consumer food diaries leads Harry Balzer of NPD Group , a marketing research firm , to this conclusion : Attitudes change more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are eating less meat , but it 's not always true and the motivations not so pure . " It 's not a dedication to avoiding meat , but a dedication to eating easier meals , " Mr. Balzer says . " It 's all about convenience . " He explains the popularity of such foods as pastas and pizza as more beneficial to the American wallet than its diet . " It sounds much better to say we 're vegetarian , than to say we 're cheap and lazy . " <p> Paradoxically , the meal makers in a multi-diet household can be anything but lazy . But it need n't mean that much extra time in the kitchen . In some families , the veggie kids routinely fix their own meals . Yet other young vegetarians have influenced their families enough that their parents and siblings adopt more of their ways . <p> " My parents are totally behind me , " says Tracy-Anne Fowler , a self-described " health nut . " While keeping her section of the family refrigerator , Tracy-Anne says her parents plan to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Candyce Prentiss says , " It 's mostly just planning ahead . " She saves leftover baked potatoes for her daughter and combines them with part of the family dinner . <p> While Mrs. Prentiss praises her daughter 's willingness to try new things , she admits to wishing she 'd help with cooking .
