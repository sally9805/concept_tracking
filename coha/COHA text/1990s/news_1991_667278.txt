<p> Rosie O'Neill 's greatest trial has just begun : the waiting game . <p> On the surface , things could n't be - well , rosier - for CBS ' well- received drama The Trials of Rosie O'Neill . A week ago , Sharon Gless won a Golden Globe for her title role of a 40-ish public defender whose grit at work is played against low self-esteem , as Rosie slowly regains her emotional footing after her husband leaves her for a younger woman . <p> And tonight 's change-of-pace episode ( 10 EST/PST ) is a high-profile lark reuniting Gless with her formidable Cagney &; Lacey co-star Tyne Daly - between them , they won six Emmys as the popular buddy cops . <p> But " this is a critical phase in the life of our show , " says Rosie 's prone-to-pessimism executive producer Barney Rosenzweig , who walked a ratings tightrope on Cagney through much of the ' 80s . When CBS failed to exercise its option for four final episodes , forcing Rosie to wrap its first season this weekend after it finishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Rosenzweig . <p> He understands the financial reasons behind CBS ' decision . After taking a bath on the World Series and now further strained by the expense of war coverage , the network is saving money where it can . <p> And the prime Monday time period , where Rosie has done fairly well but loses a substantial share of audience from Designing Women , is likely to be used to test midseason hopefuls such as the returning comedy-drama Northern Exposure . <p> All Rosenzweig really wants is an early renewal for next season so he can work ahead of the game - an impossibility last fall , when they " hit the ground running " after Connie Chung nixed her weekly series commitment and CBS needed a replacement quick . <p> " We delivered our show in a timely fashion as well as could be expected when they were in difficulty ... and I feel the need to be pampered a little bit , " says Rosenzweig . <p> Gless , 47 , says she does n't take the early shutdown personally , but echoes her boss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companion - by saying , " If they want our work to be able to build , to have some sort of emotional arc , we need that early pickup . " <p> She calls the Golden Globe a " pleasantly stunning surprise , " but adds , " If they wait around for the Emmy nominations to renew us , it 'll be too late . " <p> The mood was much lighter a few weeks ago during filming of tonight 's high- school reunion episode , much of it at a plush downtown L.A. hotel . Earlier in the day , Gless and Daly had filmed a " jane " scene - insiders ' shorthand for those moments in the ladies-room " john " that were a signature of so many Cagney episodes . <p> " We were fighting about something that happened in high school , so we had to get very adolescent to pull this scene off , " says Gless . " It was fun . " Daly , who sports a red wig in what Rosenzweig describes as " a flamboyant caricature of Tyne , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only took us a minute to get back in action . " <p> One bystander is clearly impressed . Musician Carole King ( Tapestry ) , who wrote the series ' theme , has a role in the episode and sings the song . She compares acting opposite these stars with the charge she got when Eric Clapton accepted her invitation to play on her recent City Streets album . <p> Seems like old times to Gless : cracking jokes in the makeup trailer , hanging out late to work on the next day 's scenes . " We settled into our comfortable habits , " she says . <p> But there 's a difference . This time , Daly 's just a featured guest , however prominent . And she gets to go home midday this day . Gless stays on ; as usual , she 's in every scene . <p> " I know , I know , " laughs Gless in her self-deprecating rasp between takes , when asked about her daunting workload . " People come up behind me wondering when I 'm going to drop . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she do this ? ' But I enjoy it . The adrenaline gets going . " <p> She says it 's no chore because she loves her work and the family that is her crew . But that 's not the only affection that accounts for her composure through the 14-hour grind . <p> Gless remembers Daly 's reaction when told her friend was taking on a new show : " She knew I was in good hands . " <p> Her romantic relationship with Rosenzweig , 53 , began after Cagney ended its run in 1988 , a time when Gless was exhausted and resolute against series work . " I had a lot of intentions when I finished the series . The two years I took off were enormously beneficial . <p> " I was my priority , " she says . Then she repeats it . <p> During this reprieve , she admitted herself to the Hazelden Foundation 's drug-and-alcohol rehabilitation center in Minnesota , a subject she says " gets too personal " to talk about . She also weathered a scare when a female fan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rifle while Gless was away . She has put that behind her , too . <p> Through all this , Rosenzweig was an anchor . He understands women , Gless says , although she chuckles when she recalls his doubts about " this thing of having a personal relationship with your producer . " Rosenzweig says he " predicted a lot of gloom and doom . I went so far at one point as to say , ' You know , this could be the end of our relationship if we do this . ' But Sharon is first of all a very ebullient person who believes in the power of positive thinking . And it has worked remarkably well . " <p> " We 're learning compassion and patience with one another , and I must say I 'm amazed , " says Gless , half-joking . " I 'm behaving myself . I do n't go in and throw scripts on his desk and say , ' You must be kidding . ' I phrase things a little differently than I used to when I was Cagney . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> One of the reasons Rosenzweig created Rosie for Gless is " because no one picked up the mantle after Cagney &; Lacey went off . No one went off and tried to make the kind of show we did about women . That bothered me . And then a lot of papers came out at the end of 1989 , looking back over the decade , and a lot of important journalists did n't mention our show , and I was offended . " <p> An avid feminist who hopes to digest Gloria Steinem 's new Ms. magazine for inspiration during hiatus , Rosenzweig declares women " the most interesting species . My best friends are women . ... It 's fascinating that they are a majority in our society but in so many ways are treated like a minority . <p> " Their attitudes about things like war and the economy are so much more refreshing and interesting and insightful than most guys ' . " <p> Rosie is also quite personal for Gless , who 's partly responsible for suggesting the frank therapy scenes that open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the psychiatrist . You see the back of his head , and hear his gruff voice . <p> " I happen to believe in therapy , " says Gless . " It 's important for any woman going through the life changes that Rosie is , to talk to somebody . If you assume nothing is happening inside you , you 're wrong . You 're in denial . " <p> When she talks of Rosie , you sense there 's more than a little of Gless being discussed . And she says her mail from women indicates she has hit a nerve . <p> For now , though , they must wait , hoping CBS will let them know before May that they 'll be back , so they can make a good show better , to chart Rosie 's path with more care . <p> " We need to know her better and how to have more fun with her , " says Rosenzweig . " I want to bring the child back in Rosie , " says Gless , who 's expected to hit the road by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struck by the irony of Rosie 's last line in the season 's final episode : " I did n't think I 'd be able to do it . " <p> " That sums up the whole year , " says Gless . " People kept wondering can she do it , can she carry a show every week , and I did it . " She corrects herself . " We did it .
