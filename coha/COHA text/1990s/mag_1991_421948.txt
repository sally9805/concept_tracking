Section : PERSONAL FINANCES Today 's 20- to 29-year-olds have had some bum luck . But that 's still no excuse for their ignorance of money basics . It 's time to grow up . Here 's how . <p> Whoever said that youth is wasted on the young has n't been hanging out with people in their twenties lately . Jobs are scarce ; two-thirds of the undergraduate class of ' 91 left campus without full-time employment , according to Challenger Gray &; Christmas , a Chicago outplacement firm . For many of the nation 's 40 million twentysomethings , home ownership is unattainable . Only 36% of households headed by 25- to 29-year-olds own homes , down from 44% in 1973 . This pragmatic , often pessimistic bunch rarely thinks about " having it all . " They 're too worried about not getting even a piece of it . The median family income of households headed by people under 30 was $24,470 in 1989 ; in 1973 it was $28,053 , in 1989 dollars , according to Andrew Sum , an economics professor at Northeastern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marketing firm Yankelovich Clancy Shulman : " This is the first generation that believes they will not live as well as their parents do . " <p> Often , the parents of these 20- to 29-year-olds are being squeezed financially in order to assist their kids . Nowadays , twentysomethings  --  largely baby busters  --  are asking their folks for everything from cash handouts to their old rooms back at home . Some 28% of men and women in their twenties now live with their parents . Accountant Masha Hleap , 27 , of Atlanta and her four-year-old son have been living rent-free with her mother and stepfather since her marriage broke up in 1988 ( see the box on page 58 ) . Says Hleap : " I could n't manage to save at all without their help . " <p> Certainly , many twentysomethings have brought on some of their own money problems . In an exclusive MONEY poll of 500 men and women in their twenties , conducted by the Gallup Organization , only a third said they pay off their credit-card bills in full each month . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of more than $1,000 on their cards . ( More poll results appear across the bottom of these pages . ) <p> In many ways , however , Americans in their twenties are victims of bad timing . They grew up hearing their parents talk about skyrocketing home values and the raging bull market of the ' 80s , but most were too young to join the party . Just when the group entered the work force , Congress boosted payroll tax rates so that the Social Security fund would be big enough to pay benefits to current retirees . Meanwhile , college tuition bills have spiraled upward  --  the average yearly cost of a private college is now $13,544  --  so it 's little surprise that 15% of people in their twenties with student loans owe more than $10,000 on them . <p> Nonetheless , many of this generation 's financial problems are caused by ignorance . In our poll , 39% of those admitting they were n't good at managing their money said the main reason was that they did n't know enough about finances . So if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's time to learn the right moves . " Taking control in your twenties helps assure you of emerging financially independent in your forties and fifties , " says Adriane Berg , author of Your Wealth-building Years : Financial Planning for 18- to 38-Year-Olds ( Newmarket Press , $11.95 ) . Fortunately , you may qualify for all kinds of goodies now , from the full $2,000 deduction for Individual Retirement Accounts to special cut-rate mortgages . Here are strategies recommended by top financial advisers to deal with your biggest money concerns : SAVING AND INVESTING <p> You may feel that you 've got plenty of time before you need to start saving . As one 26-year-old New York City woman put it : " I wo n't put money in an IRA . It has the word retirement in it . " But getting an early start can pay off big . Set aside $1,000 a year  --  $19 a week  --  from ages 20 to 29 and without investing a penny more , your account will be worth $210,645 at age 60 , assuming a 9% return . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 years , you 'll have only $142,441 by age 60 . <p> First priority , though , is setting up an accessible emergency fund  --  equal to three to six months ' living expenses-in a bank money-market account or a money-market mutual fund , now yielding about 5.4% . If your gross income is $30,000 and you typically spend $2,000 a month , this task will take 2 1/2 to five years , provided you save $200 a month . <p> Once this fund is in place , you can branch out . When you 're in your twenties , it 's wise to start putting some money into growth-stock mutual funds  --  investment pools that buy shares of companies whose earnings are likely to increase . Short on cash to invest ? Not a problem . More than 100 stock funds accept minimum investments of $500 or less ( for names and phone numbers of top-performing funds , see the MONEY fund rankings starting on page 138 ) . <p> Do n't be put off by the name : an Individual Retirement Account is actually one of the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a $2,000 tax deduction  --  a write-off unavailable to many older Americans with higher earnings . ( You ca n't claim the IRA deduction if you 're covered by a company pension plan and earn more than $35,000 ; or for married couples , $50,000 . ) Paul Westbrook , a financial planner from Watchung , N.J. , recommends investing your IRA in a no-load growth-oriented mutual fund such as Neuberger &; Berman Partners Fund ( up an average of 15.2% annually in the past 10 years ; 800-877-9700 ) or Vanguard Index Trust 500 ( up 15.6% a year ; 800-662-7477 ) . <p> Company savings plans , which let you put a portion of your pay in stock or fixed-income funds sponsored by your employer , are another smart way to save for the future . Earnings in these plans compound tax deferred until withdrawn , too . The best are 401(k) plans . Contributions , which are automatically deducted from your paycheck , reduce your taxable income . What 's more , employers typically match 50% of an employee 's contributions . The maximum annual investment , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set lower limits . One-quarter of the MONEY poll respondents whose firms offer 401(k)s said that they do n't take advantage of the plans because they " do n't want to lock their money up . " Actually , though , most of the plans allow you to borrow from your 401(k) to purchase a first house or to pay for graduate school . DEBT <p> Most college graduate these days with two items : a diploma and a credit card . " It 's so hard saying no when you get a letter that lets you automatically qualify for all this credit , " says Sherri Miles , 24 , of Hillsboro , Ore . ( for more about Miles , see page 55 ) . Debt , where is thy sting ? Try an average credit-card interest rate of 19% . <p> Getting off credit can be a struggle . Meanwhile , switch to an issuer with a low interest rate . Simmons First National in Arkansas ( 501-54t-1087 ) has been charging 10.5% on its variable-rate cards . For a list of 34 other cards with low rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pkwy. , Herndon , Va . 22070 . <p> If you are paying off more than one of the federal college loans known as Supplemental Loans for Students ( SLS )  --  recent interest rate : 11.49%  --  you may be able to slice your borrowing costs . The Student Loan Marketing Association , or Sallie Mae , now offers 9% SLS consolidation loans through a program known as the Smart Loan Account . For details , call Sallie Mae at 800-524-9100 . HOUSING <p> The biggest problem for would-be homeowners in their twenties is amassing the down payment . Lenders now typically require that borrowers put down 10% to 20% of a house 's price ; that 's a hefty $8,110 to $16,220 for the $81,100 median-priced home purchased by first-time buyers . Saving that kind of bankroll takes enormous discipline , as Amy Hagan , 23 , and her husband David , 24 , can attest . The couple  --  she 's director of medical records at an Atlanta hospital , and he 's a high school chemistry teacher  --  spent nine months squirreling away $16,000 of their $58,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a house . They closed on a three-bedroom Victorian in April . " We 've kept a college type of lifestyle , " says David . " We do n't have a TV or VCR , and our Ford Escort is nine years old . " <p> If your lifestyle is not so spartan , try one of the growing number of programs that allow first-time buyers to make smaller down payments . The Federal National Mortgage Association , or Fannie Mae , now sponsors a so-called 3/2 option available through local lenders . Under Fanhie Mac 's plan , you need make only a 5% clown payment  --  at least 3% must be your own cash , but 2% can be a gift from a relative . Your income can not exceed 115% of the median income in the community where the home is located . <p> Nearly every state housing agency also grants first-time buyers mortgages with rates that are one or two percentage points below the market rate . For example , the State of New York Mortgage Agency offers buyers with incomes below $54,500 , who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate of 8.3% , vs. the national average of 9.6% . To find out if you can get in on such a program , call the housing agency located in your state capital . INSURANCE <p> Since insurance is confusing for people of all ages , it 's no shock that many twentysomethings are making big mistakes with their coverage  --  or , rather , the lack of it . For example , 22% of them , like Jeff Provissiero of Fort Lauderdale ( see the photo caption opposite ) , have no health insurance . If you do n't have a health insurance policy , ask your parents if theirs can cover you . Policies normally cut off coverage when children reach 19 , but you can usually get an extension until age 23 if you are a full-time student . If you are between jobs or fresh out of college , you might consider a short-term comprehensive health insurance policy . For example , a 20- to 29-year-old male in Minnesota can get a Blue Cross/Blue Shield four-month comprehensive major-medical policy for $101 . <p> Life insurance may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you have no children . That 's because this type of insurance is meant primarily for replacing a lost source of income in the family . If you have a child , however , adequate coverage is essential . Term insurance is the least expensive type of policy when you are in your twenties ; $200,000 worth of term coverage costs about $180 a year . <p> Twentysomethings get clobbered on auto insurance . Today 's 20- to 29-year-old single males , for example , pay 50% higher premiums than older drivers do , on average . But shopping around can really pay off . When the Delaware insurance commissioner asked 20 insurers doing business in the state what they would charge an unmarried male under 24 for minimal coverage , the answers ranged from $581 to $2,898 . <p> Strikingly , most of the poll respondents who rent said they do n't own tenants insurance . Yet this type of policy is fairly cheap . You can get $25,000 of coverage for $75 to $225 a year , depending or ) where you live . And in 114 states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Insurance Program ( 800-638-8780 ) . The cost is just $126 a year for the maximum $10,000 coverage . This is money well spent : protecting your assets is as important as accumulating them . JEFF PROVISSIERO <p> This carefree young man from Fort Lauderdale had better watch his step . Unemployed since being laid off from his job as a stockbroker for Thomas James Associates last September , Provissiero , 26 , has no health insurance . " I literally had n't thought of it until my dad recently brought it up , " he says . " But health insurance just is n't a realistic expense until I get a job . " He figures a decent policy would cost about $150 a month . Meantime , his emergency savings fund is $10,000 and dwindling . Jim Fell , an administrator with the Florida insurance Department , says Provissiero is making a mistake going without the insurance . He suggests Provissiero look into buying short-term health coverage until he lands work . Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Florida , for instance , would charge him only $34 a month for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost before coverage kicks in . Or he could join a local health maintenance organization , a team of doctors offering medical care on a prepaid basis . Two possibilities : the Family Health Plan , which costs $80 a month plus $5 per office visit , and CAC Ramsay , charging $70 monthly . AMERICANS AND THEIR MONEY $ <p> How well are Americans in their twenties managing their finances ? Not fabulously . Here are some of the most intriguing results from an exclusive MONEY poll of the twentysomethings generation : TABLE <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Who needs health insurance ? <p> ILLUSTRATION <p> BY BETH KOBLINER <p> SHERRI MILES <p> When she was a sophomore in college five years ago , Miles , now 24 , got her first credit card , a Visa . That 's when her debt troubles began . After quickly racking up charges for vacations , clothing and cash advances , she exceeded her $500 credit limit , and the issuer told her to send back the card . She refused and kept the card anyway . " It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recalls Miles , who lives in Hillsboro , Ore . Now a $36,000-a-year occupational therapist , Miles is still dancing with debt . She has had trouble making the minimum monthly payments on her seven credit cards and owes $14,700 on a car loan , plus $19,900 in student loans . In June , her fiance , Dale Hert , took out a $10,000 home-equity loan and used some of the cash to pay off $2,355 of Miles ' credit-card bills . MONEY consulted Keith House , a vice president at Consumer Credit Counseling Service of Oregon , to find out what Miles should do . He urges her to destroy all her credit cards and not reapply for any until she pays off the car loan and what she owes on the home-equity loan . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Struggling with debt <p> WILLIAM DOLPHIN AND REBECCA WHITEMAN <p> Like many other Young married couples with babies , William , 28 , and Rebecca , 24 , would love to own their own home . But in San Francisco 's Haight . Ashbury district , where they now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ) in a one-bedroom rented apartment for $650 a month , the median house price is a towering $520,000 . Costly medical complications from Wen 's birth have prevented them from saving any money , and Whiteman has no income  --  she 's getting a master 's degree at San Francisco State . Dolphin earns $33,000 as an associate editor of a trade magazine . " Right now , I 'd say we have slim to no chance of buying a house , " he says . Ann Terranova , a financial planner with Lieberman Associates in nearby Larkspur , Calif. , disagrees , although she thinks the couple must wait for Whiteman 's return to work in ' 93 . " They 'll need two paychecks to afford the mortgage payments , " she says . Terranova advises the couple to start saving $400 a month in a money , market fund . And when they are ready , they might look at condos , which tend to be cheaper than houses . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Longing for a house <p> AS THIS FAMILY KNOWS , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1988 , Elena and Zev Eidelman , 55 and 57 , were hoping to sell their five-bedroom home with swimming pool in Atlanta and retire to Miami . But then Masha Hleap , Elena 's 25-year-old daughter from her first marriage , asked if she and her baby boy Arie could move back into the house . Recently divorced , Hleap was n't awarded alimony or child support , and her $32,000-a-year pay as a Price Waterhouse accountant did n't go far enough to cover Arie 's preschool and the $400 monthly rent . " I needed a backup , " she recalls . So Hleap joined the growing number of 20- to 29-year-olds living with their parents . " It was difficult at first , " Elena admits . " But we did it so Masha could get back on her feet . " <p> Hleap is still living there , contributing $200 a month toward household expenses , but she and Arie will move out in October when she marries Howard Davis , an engineer . That 's when the Eidelmans will put their home on the market again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Masha ( right ) returned to the nest with her son Arie . <p>
