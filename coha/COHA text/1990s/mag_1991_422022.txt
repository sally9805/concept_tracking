A whole " heap o ' livin ' " takes place amidst a field of these common flowers . <p> Wildflowers of many hues still grace our New York roadsides . But as summer ebbs and hints of autumn appear , yellow becomes the dominant color  --  the bright yellow of golden-rods . There is more than beautiful color in the goldenrod story however  --  much more . <p> Goldenrods , like other green plants , have that magic ability to manufacture carbohydrates  --  the calorie-rich substances that are the bane of weight-watchers . Even before the plants bloom , beetles and caterpillars have chewed on the leaves to obtain the calories they need for energy and the nutrients needed for growth . <p> Insects such as aphids ( plant lice ) that possess sharp beaks pierce the tender growing tips of the goldenrods and suck their juices . They are among the easiest insects to observe since they will not flee at your close approach . Often you will notice ants walking among and over aphids as they protect them from predators such as ladybugs or daddy-longlegs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aphids give off as a waste product . <p> When goldenrods approach full bloom , the curtain goes up on a variety of plant and insect interactions that are easy to observe . As you inspect the bright yellow blooms watch for slow moving insects that eat the pollen . Pollen is rich in the proteins that are essential for growth . Interestingly , several pollen eaters are important agricultural pests : the corn root beetle larvae which eats corn roots , the spotted cucumber beetle too often seen on flowers of cacumbers , squash , pumpkins and melons , and the locust borer larvae which make tunnels in locust trees . The common , non-belligerent polistes wasp is another insect to look for . Watch the honey bee visitors carefully and you are sure to find one with filled pollen baskets on its hind legs . It uses the pollen to make " bee bread " which is food for its larvae . <p> Nectar is a goldenrod gift eagerly sought by a host of insects . As you investigate the highest goldenrod blossoms , you may notice the large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns out that goldenrods ( and their close relatives the asters ) provide the last big source of nectar as the summer wanes . Incidentally , dark honey is usually goldenrod honey . Bumble bees , solitary bees and associated wasps also partake of this sweet bounty . Because it is available in late summer when most other wildflowers have gone to seed , goldenrod nectar is an important energy source for that favorite among butterflies  --  the monarch . <p> A variety of predators stalk insect prey among goldenrod blooms . My favorite is the ambush bug . This nondescript , misshapen blob of a creature is smaller then a Japanese beetle , but what it lacks in size and good looks is more than compensated for in patience and power . Hidden away among the flowers looking for all the world like a discolored bloom , it waits in ambush for one of the pollen eaters or nectar sippers to come within reach of its powerful forelegs . A lightning thrust , a sudden injection of proteolytic enzyme from the bugs " beak " and it 's all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give their body juices to this marvelously adapted predator . You will need to search carefully for this one . <p> Much easier to detect is the ladybug . Look for it and its weird looking larvae up among plant tips where aphids are busy sucking goldenrod sap . These beetles that are so efficient at destroying aphids are sold in commercial quantities to gardeners . It is also a good place to search for the gauzy-winged golden-eyed lacewing . <p> Beady-eyed eight-legged creature  --  spiders  --  will be easy to find . One kind , the crab spider , is aptly named as it moves sideways across the flowers . Like the ambush bug , it hides among the blossom heads and suddenly grabs its victim since it does not make the typical spider web . Crab spiders seem to be able to change color . Usually you will find yellow ones on goldenrods and white ones on daisies but if a white individual lands on a goldenrod , it will become yellow in a few days . <p> Small creatures are not the only inhabitants of goldenrods . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are approximately 100 species of goldenrods in the United States . The plants are most abundant in the Northeast , but very few vertebrates eat them . Ruffed grouse , cottontails , beaver and meadow voles eat insignificant quantities of foliage while sparrows and chickadees occasionally eat the seeds . On the other hand , horses turned into a thriving field of goldenrods will soon consume most of them . <p> Goldenrods do provide cover for an assortment of birds : quail , pheasants , sparrows  --  and mammals : shrews , mice and rabbits . More than one surprised hunter has jumped a deer that sought cover in a patch of goldenrod . <p> One of our favorite song birds , the goldfinch , has a breeding cycle nicely coordinated with the growth period of goldenrods . In New York State , this bird does not start to breed until July  --  just when the goldenrod stems are tall enough and strong enough to support a nest . I have found several active nests as late as the first week in September . <p> One group of goldenrod inhabitants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing months . These are the gall-makers  --  that assemblageof flies and moths that cause odd-looking swellings on the flowers , leaves and stems . By far the most conspicious goldenrod gall is the roundish stem swelling found only on the Canada and on the tall goldenrod species . How does it get there ? After mating in May , the female moth or fly deposits an egg on the growing tissue of the plant . When the larva hatches out , it secretes a liquid which , though miniscule in quantity , upsets the genetics of that part of the stem so profoundly that a characteristic swelling results with the gall maker safely ensconced inside . <p> By midsummer tha ball galls , as they are called , are easy to spot . If one of these galls is cut open in September you might discover the large , cream-colored maggot that caused the growth . That maggot , by the way , will spend the winter in the gall protected from the weather , but many fall victim to a hungry downy woodpecker . <p> Have you noticed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is no accident . Goldenrods actually prevent the growth of woody vegetation through a remarkable means  --  chemical warfare . It has been revealed that goldenrods release chemicals that not only inhibit the sprouting of woody plant seeds , but which also restrain the growth of any woody vegetation that does manage to invade goldenrod fields . I know of pastures in the Catskills that were abandoned decades ago , but are still essentially goldenrod fields . <p> We know how important habitat diversity is for wild creatures . We know , also , how difficult it is to hold back the succession that reduces habitat diversity . Yet there are the goldenrods , quietly and efficiently keeping areas open . Without brush hooks . Without fire . But with natural herbicides . <p> How can anyone be so enthusiastic about goldenrods ? Are n't they among the leading hayfever irritants ? No ! <p> In order for any plant 's pollen to irritate an allergic person , that pollen must be blown by the wind . Now medical researchers have established that pollen from flowering plants like roses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pollen is designed to be transported by insects , not by the wind . It is true that a person could get sensitized deliberately walking through a field of blooming goldenrods . One could also get sensitized to corn by walking through a cornfield bloom . I got sensitized as a youth by playing in a blooming rye field . One could also get sensitized if one lived downwind from a large goldenrod field . But these are the exceptions rather than the rule . In 95 out of 100 cases , the allergy specialists report , late summer allergy sufferers are vicitms of ragweed , a plant whose pollen is wind-borne only . <p> Unfortunately for us goldenrod enthusiasts , ragweed is inconspicuous and extremely prolific . One plant can expel one million pollen grains in a single day . On the other hand , goldenrod raises its brilliant yellow blooms against the sky for all to see . Since it keeps bad company , it is condemned by circumstantial evidence . So instead of damning it , let 's enjoy our goldenrod for the colorful , fascinating creation it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of goldenrod Goldenrods release chemicals that inhibit seed germination and suppress the growth of woody plants . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Late summer goldfinch nests in goldenrods are not uncommon . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Goldenrod fields are favorite haunts of honeybees . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : ( Top ) A southbound monarch butterfly pauses to sip goldenrod nectar . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : ( Above ) Striped goldenrod beetles <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Golden gall balls <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : These gall balls are caused by the larvae of peacock flies . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : ( Below ) A crab spider lies in wait . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : ( Bottom ) The ambush bug is expert in preying on goldenrod visitors . <p> by Richard B.

ISBN 978 1 84742 7 <p> L : OBJECTIVES The campaign End Child Poverty has in recent weeks highlighted the enduring high levels of child poverty in the UK and the consequences that this has in terms of social exclusion . Tackling the effects of social exclusion has been at the heart of the current government 's social and welfare policies over the past decade . <p> However in reality it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for well over 150 years . Policy makers and politicians have vigorously debated the role of the state in addressing this issue but there has been a broad consensus that poverty and the life-limiting opportunities associated with it have a major impact on family life in general and more specifically on the outcomes and experience of children and their parents . <p> Within this discussion has been a recognition that there are some neighbourhoods in which not only significantly greater numbers of socially excluded families live but also that these neighbourhoods themselves can exacerbate those difficulties . The government has attempted to address this at a cross-departmental level , realising that both the causes of social exclusion and any potential solutions are not only elusive but complex and often involve a number of inter-related factors . Despite the prominence this issue has had , the processes which lead to families experiencing social exclusion  --  and indeed the degree to which it impacts on different aspects of their lives  --  are not sufficiently understood . <p> Anne Power 's book is based on some of the findings of a large-scale longitudinal research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding the dynamics between individual families ' lives and the neighbourhoods in which they live . The study was funded by the Economic and Social Research Council and the Nuffield Foundation and supported by the Centre for the Analysis of Social Exclusion at the LSE . <p> This study sought to address three central questions : <p> * Do neighbourhood conditions of themselves make it difficult for families to bring up children in cities ? * Do informal social links that families create provide protection , security , friendship , trust and mutual support in an atmosphere of rapid social change ? * How can the wider city meet family and community needs in poor areas , given the central role of families in the city as a whole ? L : METHODOLOGY The research was based on 60,000 answers to 300 questions put to 200 families over the course of five interviews that took place with each family between 1998 and 2004 . Half of the families lived in east London while the other half lived in urban areas in northern England . Care was taken to select families that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half in work and nearly half coming from a minority ethnic background . <p> The questions covered issues within the family such as relationships between members of the immediate family , but also looked at the wider family and neighbourhood relations . Issues such as policing , regeneration , race relations , housing and child care were explored . <p> At each meeting there was an attempt to measure changes both in families and in environmental factors . The researchers asked families about their perceptions of the negative and positive aspects of their community and whether they were happy living in their neighbourhood . They wanted to ascertain whether families were planning , and/or felt able , to move . <p> This publication focuses on the stories of 24 of the 200 families . Each of the six chapters focuses on four families , giving a detailed account of their circumstances and of their views through the extensive use of quotes . The result is a rich source of information and insights that contain many valuable lessons for practitioners working with children and families in these neighbourhoods . <p> L : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not attempt to offer glib or simplistic answers to complex problems . What is very striking is the overall and very powerful message from the 24 case studies that poverty and the wider processes of social exclusion have a profound and multi-dimensional impact on family life . <p> Bringing up children in a disadvantaged neighbourhood is a real struggle for many families . Not only are many parents attempting to raise children with few material resources including inadequate incomes and housing , but also they are doing so in a pressurised environment from which they often have to protect their children . <p> Many older people , the research argues , respond to these stressors in their areas by staying in and avoiding social contact . Families do not have that option . Enabling a child to integrate through either school or play is an important part of parenting . At a time when there is much publicity about violent crime , including gang and gun-related crime , this study highlights the stress of the more mundane , lower level pressures that come from living in a materially and economically degraded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a balance . There is a recognition that while disadvantaged neighbourhoods can be a source of threat and danger , they should certainly not be demonised . Many of the 24 families reflect the views of the wider sample of 200 families that identify their neighbourhood as a major source of resilience in their lives . Services and individual practitioners need to recognise this ambivalence , as community networks can be an important source of support . <p> Another message that emerged from this study is that very often the populations of these neighbourhoods are unstable in the sense that those who are able to move out often do . This can lead to levels of insecurity and in some cases hostility toward newcomers . A particularly powerful chapter focuses on the experiences of families who have recently moved into these neighbourhoods . <p> The authors expected to identify significant cultural and social differences between the families in London and the north of England . Interestingly , however , while some of the London communities had a higher turnover of population , the overall experiences of families in both cohorts were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulty of parenting in disadvantaged neighbourhoods , but argues that these neighbourhoods are crucial for the health of cities . All too often the media simply depict them as sources of social problems . These neighbourhoods , however , provide the low waged workers on whom city economies are dependent . Power argues that in order for neighbourhoods to function well they need families who are " cells in the body " of these areas . Effective family support therefore has a social and economic value beyond merely assisting individual families with difficulties in their lives . <p> L : LINKS AND RESOURCES ?
