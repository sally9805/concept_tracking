With the change of season comes the promise of renewal and the chance to see the world in a whole new light . // LAST FALL WAS ONE OF THE DRIest on record in the West . Arrowleaf crackled underfoot like rice paper , temperatures that should have hovered close to freezing hit 60 every day , and meadowlarks were still warbling in November . It did n't feel like biggame season , and I did n't feel like hunting ; but deer and elk represent sustenance as much as sport to my wife and me , and the weather patterns that caused the drought showed no signs of abating . Two , perhaps three , times a week I would course the mountainsides that rise above our cabin and return sweaty , discouraged , and emptyhanded . The sighting of so much as a doe was cause for celebration ; the woods seemed barren , boring , and without promise . Then , one mid-November night it snowed . It was not a heavy fall , but upon awakening that morning , there was palpable change in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for the first time that season felt the electricity of anticipation . When I struck the woods there was a new snap to my step . I crossed my first trail at sunrise , and a half hour later I had four muley does and fawns in my sights . They were feeding beneath a big Douglas fir on a south-facing slope , and they never saw me . I left them and went over the ridge , striking the trail of a good-sized herd a mile away . When I caught up with the deer , they were bedded down at the head of a black coulee . A doe jumped up , and led eight does and fawns by me . They passed one by one through a gap in the timber like sheep jumping a fence . A forkhorn brought up the rear , and I considered taking him , but declined . I wanted a heavier animal . As noon approached , my legs began to tire . I turned homeward , working downslope on a gentle incline that led me over a series of terraces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two other skinheads who never knew I was there and killed a four-pointer where the forest met the canyon floor . On that one day I had seen more deer than during the previous three weeks of hard hunting . The temptation is to owe their sudden appearance to migration , but the snow depths were insufficient to create the kinds of conditions in the high country that would force game into the lowlands . The deer had actually been around all season long ; it just took a little snow for me to see them . There are both physiological and psychological reasons why this happens . Most important is the effect the first snow of the year has upon a deer 's perception of critical zones . Most deer develop a sixth sense regarding how close they will allow a human to approach before becoming evasive . This critical zone amounts to a circle of terrain and its diameter varies with the kind of cover they inhabit-the thicker the vegetation , the tighter the circle . Critical zones are largely determined by a visual limit called the forest curtain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see into the forest . It is not a wall , but more like a veil , a gauzy haze of brush and trees . At the inner limit of the curtain you can see objects clearly . At its outer limit everything is obscured . However , between those two points , a sharp eye can usually pick out the ill-defined form of a deer . Perhaps taught by the actions of older deer , or by signals of human recognition-hunters or hikers staring , pointing , yelling , making excited motions , or shooting-deer learn at what point within that curtain is safe to watch a walking hunter without being seen . Snow , because it reflects flat light into the darkest woodland corners , and because of the contrast it provides , moves the forest curtain back . But deer do n't realize that at first-remember , the animals have spent six to eight snow-free months with the woods on their side , warned by sounds and scents and hidden in dappled shadow patterns-and as a result , they stay put and are easier to spot . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system : it muffles and absorbs the sound and shock of footfalls , helps cover and diffuse human scent , and silhouettes the deer 's telltale outline . All in all , the first snow of autumn brings a dramatic change in a deer 's environment that the animal is unprepared to cope with and that makes it much easier to hunt . ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PREY/ predator relationship , snow has a positive effect on hunters and their habits . Perhaps the visual change wrought by a blanket of white suggests to our subconscious that the slate has been wiped clean . Perhaps it is the invigorating effect of cold , crisp air . Whatever the reason , the sight of fresh snow seems to call up a new reserve of human energy and resolve . You are more eager , more confident , and , as a result , you hunt harder . Tracks play a part , too . Not so much because they lead directly to game , but because a fresh track is incontrovertible evidence that a deer passed that way recently and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up psychologically . It keens your senses and forces all of them to focus upon one thing-serious hunting-and that edge often accounts for the difference between success and failure . I remember one particular fallback when I was a guide and outfitter-when the weather conditions were similar to those I experienced last year . Indian summer lingered like a curse , and except for the flurry of activity that always occurs on opening day , the meatpole behind camp held neither elk nor deer week after week . Many times watching a football or baseball game , I have sensed a lack of spirit on the part of the losing team . It is not an identifiable fault or flaw , just a kind of negative aura that hangs over the heads of the players and the way they execute their parts . An equivalent dark cloud hung over my clients every day we went up into the mountains , an overbearing sense of " the game is already lost . " THEN ONE MORNING WE AWAKened to 3 inches of snow that had flurried in during the night . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that day . The scattering clouds were tinted pink by the first rays of the rising sun and they wreathed the distant peaks like cotton candy . Snow clung to every branch and bough so lightly that it seemed a sharp breath would blow it all away . Suddenly it was a whole new ball game . Like a key play that sparks a rally , you could feel a change at the breakfast table . Conversation was more animated , everyone ate with more gusto , and where clients had lingered over their coffee befoRe , they now left the table to get suited up immediately . The presence of tracks urged them deeper into the timber that day . They complained less about being winded and tired . They went the extra yard , and that afternoon we shot a fine muley buck , then a spike elk the next morning , and the rest of the week went well . Although a fresh snowfall is a powerful ally , hunters do need to adapt to some of the changes it brings about . It 's always a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a virtual necessity when there 's new snow . Clinging to boughs , branches , and the trunks of fallen trees , cottony snow combines with the forest tones to create the illusion of an animalthe right balance and shape of white , brown , gray , or buff that suggests things like the white throat patch on a whitetail or muley , or the butt of an elk . With a pair of binoculars , these illusions can be sorted out quickly . Before I got that figured out , I spent a lot of time stalking stumps or , more embarrassing , watched the object I had positively identified as a blowdown get up and run away . Wool pants , recommended hunting apparel because they are quiet , are a must when hunting in snow . Every other material forms ice around the cuffs , which then whiff and wheeze as you walk , warning every creature within earshot . Wool stays supple and soft . Lastly , I have found that game learns to adjust quickly to the changes brought about by the first snow : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the critical zones to encompass the new forest curtain . Hunting the same area with no competition , I figure I have four days before the deer move farther back into the brush . In heavily hunted areas , I 've seen them do it the second day . When that happens , if I have the gift of time , I hang up my rifle until a truly severe storm blows in from the North , with all the physical stresses attendant to knee-deep snow and bitter cold . That kind of a snow changes game habits once again , and in other ways . But that is yet another story . <p>                     @x The colorful tents crowding the clearing where I stood would n't have looked out of place at a carnival or Renaissance fair . It would be an interesting irony : a Renaissance fair  --  a " rebirth " fair  --  here at the University of Tennessee 's Body Farm , the one place in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they decay . <p> The tents  --  white , red , green , yellow , blue  --  jostled for space at the Anthropology Research Facility . Decades earlier , an FBI agent had dubbed the UT facility " the Body Farm " after seeing the corpses scattered throughout the three wooded acres . The nickname had stuck , and now it was even inspiring a spin-off nickname : a former UT graduate student was now setting up a similar research facility in San Marcos , Texas . Even before her first research cadaver hit the ground , the Texas facility was being called " the Body Ranch . " <p> Several of the tents huddled together were supported by inflatable frames , the rest by spidery arcs of geometric tubing  --  Quonset huts , twenty-first-century style . Normally there were no tents here ; normally the brightest splash of color , apart from the grass and the leaves on the trees , was a large blue tarp draped over our corrugated-metal equipment shed and its small , fenced-in concrete pad . The tents  --  whose festive colors belied the barren winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erected just twenty-four hours earlier , and twenty-four hours from now they would be gone again . Despite the carnival look , the tents were a stage for the acting out of a nightmare scenario , one of the darkest events imaginable : an act of nuclear terrorism . <p> A nude male body lay faceup on a gurney within the largest of the tents , his puckered skin gone gray and moldy from three weeks in the cooler at the morgue at the University of Tennessee Medical Center , visible just above the Body Farm 's wooden fence and barren treeline . Fourteen other bodies  --  selected and stored over the preceding month  --  were locked in a semi-tractor-trailer parked just outside the fence . The fifteen bodies were stand-ins for what could be hundreds or thousands or even  --  God forbid  --  tens of thousands of victims if nuclear terrorists managed to inflict wholesale death in a U.S. city somewhere , someday . <p> Five people surrounded the gurney . Their faces and even their genders were masked by goggles , respirators , and baggy biohazard suits whose white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black rubber gloves and boots . One of the white-garbed figures held a boxy beige instrument in one hand , and in the other , a metal wand that was connected to the box . As the wand swept a few inches above the head , then the chest and abdomen , and then each arm , the box emitted occasional clicks . As the wand neared the left knee , though , the clicks became rapid , then merged into a continuous buzz . Having spent my childhood shivering through the Cold War  --  practicing " duck and cover " during civil defense drills , as if my wooden school desk could shield me from a Soviet hydrogen bomb  --  I was well acquainted with the urgent clicking of a Geiger counter . <p> As the wand hovered , the other four people leaned in to inspect the knee . One took photographs ; two others began spraying the body with a soapy-looking liquid and scrubbing the skin , paying particular attention to the knee . As they scrubbed , one of them removed a small orange disk , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the team leader . A tiny , safely encapsulated speck of radioactive strontium  --  enough to trigger the Geiger counter , but not enough to pose any hazard  --  simulated contamination on the corpse . Once the scrubbing was complete , the technician with the Geiger counter checked the knee once more . This time the instrument ticked lazily , signaling normal background radiation . At a sign from the team leader , the body was wheeled out of the tent and returned to the trailer that held the other fourteen corpses , which had already undergone similar screening and decontamination procedures . <p> One by one , the Tyvek-suited figures rinsed off beneath what had to be the world 's coldest shower : a spray of soapy water mixed with alcohol , a last-minute addition necessitated by the day 's subfreezing temperatures . The team 's contamination , like that of the bodies , was simulated , but the goal was to make the training as realistic as possible , despite the added challenges provided by the bitter cold . Only after the shower did the goggles and respirators come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lovelady , emerged from one of the white suits , followed shortly by Art Bohanan , the resident fingerprint expert at the Knoxville Police Department . The team leader was Hank Strickland , a health physicist , one who specialized in radiation and radiation safety . Hank worked at a facility in Oak Ridge called REAC/TS  --  the Radiation Emergency Assistance Center and Training Site  --  that sent medical response teams to help treat victims of radiation accidents anywhere in the world . But Hank , like Miranda and Art , was here today as a volunteer team member of DMORT , the Disaster Mortuary Operational Response Team . Formed in the early 1990s to identify victims of mass disasters such as airliner crashes and hurricanes , DMORT was part of the U.S. Public Health Service , but the teams were staffed by volunteers with specialized , and even macabre , skills : their ranks included funeral directors , morticians , forensic dentists , physicians , forensic anthropologists , police officers , and fire fighters  --  people accustomed to working with bodies and bones . DMORT volunteers , including some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the World Trade Center bombings . They 'd also spent two months recovering and identifying bodies after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans and the Gulf Coast in 2005 . Art himself had spent six weeks in Louisiana after Katrina , lifting fingerprints and palm prints from bloated , rotting corpses . One body was that of a man who 'd been trapped in an attic by rising waters . More than a hundred days after the man drowned in the attic  --  how ironic was that ?  --  Art and a colleague managed to lift a print and ID the man . <p> <br> Continues ...
