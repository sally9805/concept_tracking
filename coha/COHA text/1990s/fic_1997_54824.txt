Hail , Arthur , King of the Britons . " <p> He set down his rag and extended his hand as I approached . " Max , " he said , " good to see you again . You have n't been around much lately . " <p> " You know me , " I said jovially . <p> " Yes , I do , " he answered . " Where was it this time ? Middle East ? China ? " <p> " Oh , here and there , you know . " I waved the question off in seeming modesty , but I do n't think it fooled him . <p> After a moment he nodded his head and said again , " Yes , I know , " but he let it drop . <p> I followed him inside , out of the New York summer and into the mechanical winter of an overworked air conditioner . A faint odor of freon hung in the air , or what I think freon would smell like if it had an odor ; sharp , metallic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the store cold in the summer . He claimed it was good for the produce , kept it from wilting so fast under the weight of the sodden air , but those few of us who had known him for some time remembered how it had taken years of summer 's crushing heat before he had finally begun wearing short-sleeved shirts . Even now he would n't wear short pants , in public or private . He was n't , he explained , a " shorts " kind of person . <p> I followed him toward the back of the store , occupying myself with my thoughts as he stopped several times to wait on customers before he finally ducked behind a pile of bananas nearly as tall as himself , though half that height was the stand the pile sat on and half its volume , I knew , was a carefully concealed cardboard box . " The illusion of prosperity breeds prosperity , " he had solemnly explained when I had first gasped in mock outrage at this deception , and apparently he knew what he was talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> He tossed me a banana and watched me with a small smile as I ate it . <p> " You 're looking good , " he finally said . <p> " So are you , " I responded , and at least I was n't lying . I knew how my appearance had changed in the more than a year gone by . The lost hair . The heavy line of scar tissue running below my left ear almost to my collarbone that was still startling pink and fresh looking against my perpetually sunburnt neck . The thinness of my face and hands . And subtler things . Shadows in my eyes , Sandra had called them , just before she left me . <p> Arthur looked the same . He always did . <p> I 'd known him on and off for twelve or more years , casually , which I gathered was as well as anyone knew him . Whenever I came back to the neighborhood we would sit down , have a drink , talk politics or religion or just shoot the breeze for an evening . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't have more conversations like that , the ones that left you emotionally and intellectually satisfied and entertained , the kind it looks like they 're having on beer commercials . <p> And then for the next week I 'd pass him at the store , and he 'd wave , nod hello , keep waiting on his customers . And then it would be time for me to go again , back out on assignment , wherever the news was , or at least the photogenic news . The wars . <p> I think he appreciated my disbelief , that it allowed him a certain degree of anonymity that he could never really achieve with most other people . <p> When my friend Jill had introduced us ( Jesus , where was she now ? Happy ? Still alive ? ) , she had looked eagerly at me as she said , " Max , meet King Arthur . " <p> He certainly looked the part . I have few pretensions about my physical machismo , but he had the kind of imposing stature and overwhelming solidity that psychologically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , solid looking . Blond hair that fell in a shag cut to his shoulders and a beard a complementary darker shade of blond , almost brown . He moved with what I suddenly understood the cliche " supple grace " to mean ; under his rugby shirt , I saw the muscles bunch and crowd together in the simple act of Arthur wiping the water and bits of fruit pulp off his hand before offering it ; his arms , upper and lower , were the corded cables of a man who had spent his life lifting things . But his smile was as warm and modest as his grip . <p> " Hail , Arthur , King of the Britons , " I had said , grinning . <p> " And well met , " Arthur grinned back . <p> " No , really , I mean it , " Jill had insisted . " This is the King Arthur ! " <p> " No . I was the King Arthur . " He shrugged . " Now I 'm just Arthur . A pleasure to meet you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name yet , and I told him so . " Magic ? " I asked . <p> " Ah , no ! That would be Merlin 's department . He runs a shoe store up in the Garment District . " He laughed and winked , ignoring Jill 's foot stamping as he nodded toward her . " She told me she 'd be bringing you by today . " <p> " I thought you two would get along , " Jill said , and added with a humph , " but I did n't think you 'd get along this well . " <p> We laughed for a while more , still mostly at Jill 's expense , and Arthur apologized to her as we left , offering her a tangerine in recompense . Later , in my apartment , she continued to insist that this local grocer was the once and future king . <p> " You ask anybody on that street , in this whole neighborhood , " she said . " They 'll all tell you . " <p> " Truth is not a majority rules situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of them , and I 'm asking you , the same thing I say to people who claim UFOs land in deserted cornfields in the Midwest : Why ? Why fly hundreds of light years to spook some dairy farmer whom nobody 's going to believe ? Huh ? Why would King Arthur be selling produce in New York City ? " <p> The argument momentarily stalled her , longer than it did the usual crackpot but only because she knew me , and knew that arguments of faith , of mere belief , would n't hold any sway . <p> " But you 'll notice , " she finally said , " that he never denied it . " <p> And he had n't . He had joked , he had deflected with sarcasm , he had changed the subject , but he had never said anything , explicitly or implicitly , that refuted Jill 's , and the neighborhood 's , claim . That he was King Arthur . <p> He stared at me from the backdrop of bananas , waiting on my silence . <p> But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then laughed . " Good , I mean , but tired . How long are you back for ? " <p> " I do n't know , " I answered . Until I figure out why I came back in the first place . Until the shadows go away . <p> What is it that draws us back to places , into the rituals of our past even when there is no more reason for it , when the people who had moored us to that shore have gone and we 're left adrift , without anything tying us to anywhere anymore. ? My parents passed away now , several years ago and within two months of each other ; Sandra left so completely that I no longer even knew which coast she was on , or where between them ; Carl dead , too , at the hands of some drunk driver ; one by one the lines severed , snapping away in sudden whiplashes of pain and crackling air . <p> Memories , I suppose , is the only answer . As clear and artificial as fishing line , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that even when we want to push off from that shore , set out for somewhere new , just run and hide , we find ourselves inexorably drawn back to the familiar shore and the familiar tracks that we have worn in its sands , grooves scratched so deep by our repetitious passing that now , even if we want , we can not jump out of them any more easily than a train can jump its tracks ; it can be done , but the price is destruction . <p> Why did I come back here ? I honestly did n't know , and the lack of reason nagged at me , one more piece taken away from inside of me , or one more piece added to the growing void ; it came to the same thing . Perhaps it was precisely for that familiar shore ; if not peopled by loved ones , then at least not by total strangers , and the comfort of surrendering to the carved out path . I did n't know if that was the answer , but it was an acceptable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me gently as I walked to Clyde 9 's , the tavern on Ninth Avenue . <p> It was , in many ways , a changed place ; larger , more open . Clyde had knocked out most of the two exterior walls that formed the corner facing the streets and replaced them with windows . The lighting inside was brighter as well , but I could n't tell if it was a trick of illumination combined with the illusion of boundlessness engendered by the new windows or if perhaps Clyde had knocked out an interior wall as well : the place felt bigger , a single open room . But the old wooden bar still ran along one side of the room , chocolate-colored wood chipped and worn over the years into a strange abstract sculpture . I did n't recognize the man behind it . <p> Arthur sat at a small round table just below the bar ; there was no symbolism in the act , all the tables in Clyde 's are round . He was smiling at me as I entered the door , and had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite him . <p> Around him were people I had known here , grown up with in this neighborhood , friends , acquaintances , faces I did not know , gathered together . The group was large and dispersed , and it was n't clear to me if they had come together here for me and were awaiting my arrival , or if it was mere chance that on this night so many people familiar to me were in this one place at this one time , or perhaps something in between . There was no sudden shout of greeting , no huzzah of warm recognition as I came and sat across from Arthur , but rather a slow ripple through the crowd as one by one they noticed my presence and came over to greet me , inquire about me , welcome me home . Arthur lounged in the chair opposite me , his feet stretched out and his fingers curled together loosely on his stomach , beaming . <p> " How did you know ? " I said . <p> He shrugged , still smiling . " Tradition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night you come back . Just because neither one of us mentioned it does n't mean it was n't going to happen . " He raised his glass and touched it to the bottle I held ; they met with a small piercing clink . " To traditions , " he said , " and homecomings . " <p> I took a long pull at the bottle , upending it into my lips and letting it drain in foamy hiccups into my throat . Arthur said nothing as I set the empty bottle on the table and ordered another , and I appreciated that . I knew it was a mistake , that you ca n't drown the kind of dark fires that I was carrying inside me , that they simply rise to the top like oil and burn closer to the surface , but I did it anyway . <p> " So how come you did n't tell us you were coming back ? " Mark Novacek twisted on his stool at the bar , joining our small circle with a twist of his seat , and beside him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the long slender legs of the barstools looked precarious beneath them , as though they might snap at any moment and send them flying down into us . Mark 's voice bellowed at close range , his natural boisterousness amplified by the alcohol that glowed in the veins of his face . <p> " Did n't know I was , " I said . " Just kind of decided , at the last minute . Needed a vacation , you know ? " I shrugged , smiling wanly . <p> " You still at the Times international desk ? " Stan asked . Unlike Mark , Stan 's physical size was mitigated by the soft tenor of his voice , and I had to lean in toward him , asking him to repeat the question , when I saw his lips moving , his eyes in my direction . " You still  --  " he held his hands up , forefingers raised , one of them clicking down with a quick motion in the international pantomime for taking a photograph . <p> " No , yes , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm still in photo-journalism . No , I left the Times . I 'm at Reuters now . Same thing , different boss . " <p> " I hear that ! " Mark said . We raised our bottles to it . Any port in a storm . <p> In a surprisingly short amount of time an inverted forest of brown glass grew up from our tabletop , long thin bottlenecks sticking up . Not all were ours some were Mark and Stan 's , swivelling back and forth between the bar and our table , from conversation to conversation . Some belonged to more itinerant conversationalists , people who knew me or Arthur or both , who stopped by for a moment to pay their respects , engage us in brief discussion before patting me on the shoulder and passing away into the crowd ; leaving , if they 'd happened to finish it at this station of the cross , their empty bottle like an offering or a memento . <p> But most of them were mine . <p> " I hope you do n't mind all this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as though they were all here on my behalf , a celebration for me . Or a wake . " Earlier today you had a look in your eyes . The look of a man who needs his friends about him . " He drained his bottle , his contribution to the table far outweighed by my own . " I 've seen that look before . " <p> " I appreciate it , " I said . " I mean , I do , but it just . . . makes me a little uncomfortable , you know . That 's why I work on the side of the camera that I work on . I 'm not big on being in the spotlight . " <p> " They 're just worried about you , and glad that you 're okay , " he said . " You live a dangerous life . " <p> " Nah . I just take pictures of other people leading dangerous lives . " <p> " Can I assume , then , that you got that  --  " he pointed to the pink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkroom accident ? " <p> I touched the scar , running my finger down the ridge of hard skin . " Close , " I answered . " Car accident . Coming home from a bar in London after having had just enough to drink to forget which side of the road I was supposed to be on . " <p> " So you 've been covering the war in England ? " Mark asked . I had n't realized he was listening , would n't have brought it up if I 'd known . I glanced at Arthur , but he was looking away , into the crowd as though he 'd spotted someone and was following their movement . <p> " Yep ! " I said finally . " England , Zaire , Tibet , Tajikhistan . You name it , if there 's a war there , I 've covered it . " <p> " Wow . " He shook his head in wonderment . " That must be really exciting . " <p> " Yeah , " I answered . " Listen , will you excuse me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this . " I pointed at the bottles , winking and slapping him hard on the shoulder as I passed by . I felt Arthur 's eyes on me as I left , I thought , or a weight like that of a stare , but when I glanced back toward the table as I retreated down the hall leading to the restroom , Arthur was turned toward a woman standing beside the table , talking with the same easy conviction he always had . <p> I slipped into one of the stalls , pulling the door quietly shut behind me and throwing its latch . I hung for a moment from its top , sagging , and was surprised to find myself sweating , a thin sheen that gathered at my hairline and slowly rolled down my forehead in a steady wave . I tried to breathe deeply for several seconds , calming myself , waiting to feel the slow rush of nausea , but my stomach was fine , only tender from overfilling , and I undid the top button on my pants , easing some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the stool . <p> If I was n't sick , why was my head buzzing , spinning ? No , churning ; a greater chaos than simple alcoholic haze , a white noise building at the base of my skull and writhing its way through the neural paths of my mind . My head in my hands , I could feel the vibration of it on my palms , like electricity . I wanted to cry . <p> I gulped air , swallowing the sobs before they escaped and setting my hand against the stool 's base for a moment , absorbing its cool moisture before pushing my fingers over my forehead and through my hair . The shadows , Sandra had called them , and she was right ; the room narrowed around me , my vision darkening at the periphery , breaking up even in the harsh light of the restroom 's overhead fluorescent bulbs . I stared straight ahead , as I always did when this happened , focusing my gaze on the lengthening tunnel of light directly ahead of me , refusing to look into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what lived in there , what sad creatures the shadows were home to . With each passing year , each assignment , they had grown deeper and more populous , but I was no longer certain of the relative movement , if they were advancing on me or if I was pushing further into their realm . <p> Finally , after several minutes , it passed , the shadows dispersing in jagged fragments as my heart slowed , the quaking in my hands subsided . I stepped out of the stall , splashing my face briefly with cold water , washing away the thick oil of sweat and cooling the flush of my face . I dabbed the water away with the rough paper towels provided , watching my face in the mirror and marveling as always that they insisted on using fluorescent lighting in bathrooms , its blue radiance making me look pale and sickly ; I hoped it was the lighting . On my neck , the scar glowed bright pink . <p> In the bar , our table had disappeared beneath a press of people , an audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the group I could hear his voice rising , though I could n't see him . He was speaking in what he called his " storyteller 's voice , " a soothing bass spoken in almost a whisper , rising and falling as though following some otherworldly melody , singing his story to the crowd as one sings a bedtime story to a child in that same tone : comforting , unthreatening , lulling . <p> I 'd heard this voice before , had listened in the past as Arthur had entertained friends and strangers with the stories and strange songs of , well , Arthurian Britain , his past or his namesake , take your pick . Why is it that after a millennium and a half we 're still suckers for this ; knights in armor , feats of derring do , noble lords and ladies , bittersweet victories ? Do we take that much pleasure in deluding ourselves ? This was n't the real world , not now and not then . I 'd confronted him once on it , thrown in his face the simple , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stories he was telling , had no bearing on reality : knights did n't wear metal plate armor then , mostly leather . There was no evidence that England was united under a single king or even warlord at that point , not even in order to fight the Germanic invaders . There were no dragons , no giants , no glorious battles , not the way we think of it . Armies were small , battles brief and bloody and fought on foot . Tournament jousting was n't even invented until the thirteenth century . So how could he tell these stories to people who were so obviously eager to believe what he said as gospel ? <p> " Have you ever eaten an Italian pizza ? " he answered me cryptically , but went on , saving me from cries of " evasion . " " Italian pizzas , real Italian pizzas , are nothing like American pizzas . They do n't use tomato sauce . They 're just the dough , and a lot of olive oil , swimming in olive oil , and then some toppings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little diced tomato . Then they 're flash baked in a brick oven , the olive oil just heats up and cooks it all like that ! " he snapped his fingers . " They 're great , but you ca n't get them outside of Italy . I 've tried . Hell , I even tried in authentic immigrant restaurants , in London , here in Little Italy , you name it . You order a pizza , even in one of those places , and it 's still cheese and tomato sauce , maybe a little olive oil for flavor . I asked someone one time how come they do n't make real Italian pizzas , and she said ' Because nobody over here likes them . When they order Italian pizza , this is what they want . ' See , if you 're not Italian , all that olive oil can be hard to take . And the taste of it ; well , it takes some getting used to . It 's not what you were expecting . " <p> " Like the bananas , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're just giving them what they want to hear . " <p> " Illusion has its purposes , " he replied . <p> And he had gone on telling his stories , even in front of me , letting the people think they were getting the real thing , what it was really like , sometimes winking at me as he spun his tales , acknowledging that I alone of them all was in on the joke . <p> But tonight was a story I 'd never heard before , and for a moment a thrill ran through me . Even though I must have missed the beginning I thought I recognized the action , what it had to be ; a true story , maybe , one I do n't think he 'd ever told before . The story of his return . <p> " I rose up , off the stone , " he was saying , and I thought , what stone ? How did you first wake up , where had you been and where were you before that ? What did I miss ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stayed silent in the back of the crowd , just listened . " It was hard , too hard , I felt like old stone myself . It would have been so much easier to lie there in the darkness . But I rose up , and put my feet on the floor . And I began to walk . Where ? I had no idea . Who knows what magic woke with me , to guide me to my destiny ? I walked in darkness and I raised my hands and they touched a door . Magic , it must have been . A door , a stone door . I could feel its seams beneath my fingers . I pushed ; I strained . Magic or no , the doors were still heavy stone , and I screamed as I pushed , with the effort , with the desire . And the doors opened . <p> " Light . Pale light , it must have been , because it was dawn , but it flooded across me like a sea in the desert . Green grass . Blue sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What else could I do ? I was naked , lost , confused ; whatever geas impelled me earlier , it had left me when I left my stone womb , and now , reborn , I was alone . I walked . Until I came upon the most amazing thing I 'd ever seen . <p> " A river . Frozen , though the air on my skin felt like a summer morning . I knew , indeed , that this was a magical world , if rivers froze in summer . And it was black , dark as midnight , yes , dark as the cave . I touched it , with a finger , then with a toe . Solid , indeed . I stepped out onto its surface , marveling at this miracle . . . " <p> He stopped , and suddenly I could see it , in my mind 's eye , could imagine his sly face , the little grin dancing at the ends of his mouth , fighting to hold it in for one more beat as he took in the faces of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the story ; I was in on the joke . I moaned inwardly , disappointed , angry . <p> " . . . and almost got creamed by a Jaguar doing seventy-five , " he finished . There was silence for a moment , the crowd taking time to realize they 'd been had , it was all a bad joke , it was n't truth at all , no revelation or epiphany . They laughed loudly then , continued chuckling as they began to disperse back to their private domains , shaking their heads and chortling at their own gullibility and Arthur 's skill . <p> " The Matter of Britain , " I said suddenly , very loudly . Rivulets of sweat dripped down my cheeks . " Is n't that what they 're called , stories about King Arthur : the Matter of Britain ? I have a story for you . " <p> The crowd had stopped , turning toward me in a silence somewhere between curiosity and embarrassment ; without even a cough to stir the air it suddenly felt cold in the room ; not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stillness of the crowd-heated air adding cumulatively to the growing glow of my own face , neck , even my hands radiating drunken humiliation and anger at the low tide of simpering , smiling , indulgent faces around me . No , the room went suddenly very cool , the crystal stillness of winter , of frost , of death and leaving , bloodless and shocked . The faces staring at me . <p> " Once upon a time , " I said . I did my best to imitate Arthur 's soothing baritone , but my voice broke , wavered ; I went on anyway . " Once upon a time England was at war . The Welsh were fighting the English and the Scots were fighting the English and of course the Irish were fighting the English . Sometimes , even the English were fighting the English . Just like when the Romans pulled out of Britain , and everybody jumped on everybody else . And just like every war for the last three hundred years , it seemed there were as many journalists there as soldiers . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brady the people back home just do n't believe it 's a war if they do n't get to see the pictures for themselves . <p> " So there were all these journalists at the war , with their notepads and their cameras , and the soldiers with their guns and their hand grenades . And one day a group of journalists went out with a patrol , their pool got called up and off they went in an APC with a group of soldiers whose sergeant was twenty-two years old . They were patrolling near Carlisle , in northwest England , in an area where the English had been taking heavy losses in a Scottish National Liberation Party offensive , and it does n't matter whose side this patrol was on because unless you were a soldier you could n't tell the difference anyway . Half the time it was militias from the same neighborhoods fighting each other . <p> " This patrol was cruising a country lane , one of those old sunken roads that have been there since the Romans , so sunken it 's almost a tunnel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not an APC , not any kind of armament  --  an automobile . A Peugeot , a white station wagon . Everybody knows civilian cars are n't on the roads anymore , there 's not enough gas and it 's too dangerous , too many mines , for pleasure driving . So the soldiers stepped on it , the APC started really rumbling down this lane like a bobsled , riding high up on curves as it tried to follow this winding lane . And the Peugeot started speeding up , too ; it knew these soldiers were behind it . But it was just no match . The APC did n't even have to overtake it ; when it got close enough it just opened up with its mounted guns . <p> " The journalists were all loving this . This was serious shit , real danger and excitement but on a small enough scale to be understood by folks back home . Real Sunday Supplement material . <p> " The station wagon rolled up the embankment , flipped in a cloud of dust and burning oil . By the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the people inside had crawled out . One man was crawling along the road in the dirt , dragging himself ; his knee bent almost ninety degrees in the wrong direction and both of his eyes already swollen shut , his face was purple under the blood . The other people were n't hurt as bad . Two other men , surly men that looked almost middle-aged , which meant they were probably twenty-eight or twenty-nine . Dark hair , dark jackets , glaring at the soldiers with a look that told you straight off they were enemy militia . But behind them they were shielding two young women , and the women were scared for real , so scared that neither one of them was making a sound . One of the girls had two kids with her , one maybe six was holding her hand and looking bored like this sort of thing happened to him and Mom all the time . The other one was a toddler , a big roly-poly boy so bundled up he looked almost spherical , and that one was screaming his lungs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down off the carrier and started forward ; the soldiers ' guns just slung over their arms casually . They stopped , looking at this motley group , maybe trying to decide what to do . The one man , the hurt one , was still crawling , obviously not seeing where he was going because he crawled right onto the boot of the soldier out in front , who looked down like a slug has just crawled across him . Without even raising his gun from where it was slung he pulled the trigger , just for a second , and about twenty rounds of ammunition spiked the guy to the ground . He writhed around for a second , then stopped . Meanwhile , we 're still standing off to the side taking pictures and writing all this down . <p> " The sergeant whistles at the others then and says something in this thick northern accent and the rest of them come forward , some gathering around the women and children and the rest separating off the two men , bullying them up the road a little bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves , explain what they were doing out on the road , who they are . I could n't tell if the guards were listening at all because I was zoomed in tight , all the way so that all I could see in the viewfinder was the muzzle of a gun as it kept butting gently into one of the men 's stomach , prodding him . <p> " And then they just shot them . <p> " I was blind for a second , because I 'd been tight on the muzzle when it erupted . Behind me the women started screaming finally , shrieking and trying to push away the guards . I turned toward them , blinking , my right eye was watering badly , so I was standing there blinking as the girls fought and pushed , though I could n't tell if they were trying to get to the two dead men or just get away . One , the youngest one , broke away but did n't get two steps before they shot her in the back , and at the same time opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding . She just crumpled , fell straight down with the baby underneath her . Still screaming , a bundle of bloody rags trapped under its dead mother . One of the soldiers walked over to it and stomped on it , once , hard , and then it was quiet . <p> " The other little boy still stood in the middle of the road , all these bodies around him , his hands by his sides . It suddenly seemed to hit him , all of it , and his face screwed up then , his eyes getting big and his mouth opening , but before he could get anything out they shot him in the face . He went down right next to his mother . <p> " I got it all on film . Seven people dead . It took me a minute to realize that the whining was my camera motor , frame after frame of the dead still clicking off , rolling forward , making room for the next shot . I was prepared to fight for it , swallow the film , whatever it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked me about it . When I got back to the lab I was sweating , shaking , I kept spilling chemicals and pulling the film off the loops . I could smell awards on that film , front pages across the world . Maybe , after the war , a photographic retrospective . <p> " When the first photo developed , I threw up . Each one came up , the images materializing , more horrible than the last . I walked out of the lab , just left them in their pans of chemicals , and got out of there . Got the first flight back here , back home . " <p> I stopped then , drawing myself up and looking up finally . They all still stood there , waiting , listening , some with hands to their mouths , some with heads down , some whispering to friends and laughing quietly until they saw my gaze on them . I could n't see Arthur , still seated below the level of the crowd . I felt an effusive dampness on my face , and hoped sincerely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wept in front of this room full of strangers . <p> " Home to what ? " I said . " To a bunch of people wanting to hear stories about England , and war . That 's the Matter of Britain . " <p> I spat , a sudden action like the striking of a snake , and the splash of its impact on the floor in the still quiet room was loud , grotesque . People jumped back , moving finally for the first time since I 'd started speaking . I do n't know why I did it ; certainly these people did n't deserve the despite of that act . Most of them I barely knew at all , they should have engendered nothing more than my indifference . It was , in its way , the cruelest act of my life . <p> Arthur stood up then , rising from the middle of the dense pack of people . They parted before him , giving him easier access to me , and I hung my head like a schoolboy , but my cheeks retained their icy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting as I refused to look into his face , and then embraced me . <p> " I think you need a place to stay tonight , " he said softly . " I think you need to sleep this off . " <p> I wept into his shoulder . <p> His home was unexpected in its normalcy . Like every other apartment you might walk into in New York : a couch and easy chair squared around a coffee table , close by a dinette set as the living room backed up into the dining area . A couple of bookcases filled with paperbacks and a few knickknacks to break up the spacing . A stereo . A photograph of JFK hung on one wall , looked like maybe a campaign glossy , but when I got closer I noticed someone had drawn a mustache and blacked out some teeth with a pen . <p> " Do you want a b  --  " He stopped , considering me , then shook his head and went into the kitchen , returning with two tall glasses of iced tea . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against my forehead , but did n't drink any . I made a show of looking around . " Nice place . " <p> He shrugged , " It 's not Camelot , but it works for me . A lot less drafty , too . Hey , you want to see something ? " He turned without waiting for an answer and headed off down the hall . I was n't sure if it was something he was going to bring out , or if I was supposed to follow , but when he did n't return I assumed the latter , and followed cautiously where he 'd gone . Something inside of me was afraid ; I do n't know if it was the alcohol , or the lack of sleep , or probably something deeper and more remote , but the shadows in this place frightened me . At every step I expected something to jump out at me . <p> But it was just a hallway , with a bedroom at the end , and Arthur stood next to one wall , beside a hamper full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , framed by a plain , heavy wooden box , backed in green velvet . Two thick metal pins supported it beneath the cross guards , and two more where the blade began its sharp taper toward a rounded point . <p> " Excalibur , " he said . <p> I stared . It was large , fully four and a half feet long at least . Silver wire wrapped in a tight spiral around the grip ; the rest of the hilt was gold , from the pommel down to the tips of the guards . Only two stones were set in it , an emerald in the flat center of the pommel as large as my thumbnail , and in the center of the guard , and centered above the blade below , a single deep ruby . Small , almost delicate , and all the more powerful for its singularity amongst the gold . <p> The blade , mirror polished , flowed like quicksilver in a straight line until , perhaps two inches from its point , it swung inward . The edges glinted sparks in the lamplight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Cost me a fortune . " <p> I turned on him . He was smiling at me , grinning , holding back laughter . <p> " It 's not real ? " <p> " Come on , Max . Even magical swords rest after fifteen hundred years ! " <p> I turned toward him , looked at him , his broad smirking face , his lips pressed tight together under the bristling fall of his mustache , and I suddenly understood . Understood him , understood why I 'd come back to this place , what enchantment had drawn me . <p> " You 're him , " I said , not a question . " You 're really him . " <p> He had puffed up when I 'd turned , preparing to defend himself again as he had against me so many times , but instead he expelled the breath in a bursting laugh . <p> " What ? " I asked . <p> " That 's not what I expected you to say , " he answered , shaking his head . He was still smiling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What , did you think I 'd doubt you some more ? I 'm too tired for doubt . Doubt is a struggle , it takes effort . " <p> " So you 're just giving up on the truth ? " <p> " No , did n't you hear me ? I 'm giving in to truth . I believe you now , I believe you 're King Arthur and I believe that 's Excalibur and I 'll believe anything you tell me . It 's the truth , it 's all the truth . " <p> " Now you 're just humoring me , " he said sadly . <p> " No , " I insisted . " I believe . I want to believe . " I 've got to believe , or the shadows will never go away . " Save them , " I said . <p> It burst out as a sob , half-strangled in my belated effort to swallow the words , stop them , devour them before they escaped . Arthur looked up at me suddenly , surprised , frightened . For a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room , turn and leap from the window rather than stand before me . But he stayed , looking at me as though probing through me , and then he smiled again sadly and nodded , like he understood it all . <p> " You 've seen some sad things , Max , " he said finally . " But do n't let it kill your hope . Things will get better . " <p> " Is that what you think this is about ? " I felt a sudden hot gush of anger sprout inside me , and spun in an agitated circle , flinging my arms out . Tea sloshed on the carpet . " My hope ? " <p> He nodded . <p> " Not mine ! Not mine ! " I yelled at him . " Theirs ! Do n't you get it ? Do n't you even understand it yourself ? That 's what you are : Hope . The hope that when things get bad , somebody 'll come along to make it better . Well , they 're bad , okay ? They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killing  --  " I only seemed to make the fire in me hotter , the words ripping out of my throat and dredging chunks of flesh on the way up , leaving it raw and torn . "  --  they 're killing babies and women and old men . It 's not war ! They 're killing babies , for Christ 's sake ! That 's not war , war 's bad enough , but Jesus . . . And you 're here , half a world away , selling fucking groceries ! " <p> I flung the glass at the wall , at the sword hanging there , and it smashed against the steel , shattering into slivers that sprayed across Arthur . He stood without flinching , glaring at me ; blood began flowing from a dozen minute cuts on his face , oozing slowly up like stigmata . <p> " You have no idea what you 're talking about . " He said it in an even tone , almost conversational , but the rippling of violence , a subsonic wave beneath his words , struck me like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor , to sit on the bed , and stood my ground . " You do n't know what I went through . They 're just stories to you , myths . I lived them . I watched my friends die , one after another . I watched my wife . . . my son . . . I had to watch it all fall apart around me . They took my soul , Max . They left me with nothing . And I remember all of it , every damned minute . In the end , they did n't even let me just die and forget . " <p> There are moments when a person 's life opens before you , startled into fullness by something insignificant , something meaningless if it was n't the key to everything ; the way a man suddenly shouts at his aged mother for her forgetfulness , seeing in her decline his own impending loneliness , or the intemperate joy of the young couple , newly married , watching as a neighborhood child teaches herself to skate , laughing not at her falling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing through her years down their own road , their own children in her unsteady unstoppable legs . <p> For a brief second Arthur 's gaze slipped to the floor , before snapping back up to mine . The flick of a gaze , nothing more , but for the first time , he was n't flippant about the legend he had attached himself to , nor pedantic , nor even melodramatic . He was simply tired ; fifteen hundred years of sleep can not absolve a man of the exhaustion of the life he had led , had been forced to lead . He could not bear the weight of remembrance , and was afraid , desperately afraid that they would ask the same thing of him again . And that he would fail . Again . <p> " Do n't you see , " I said . " Do n't you get it ? That 's the point . Even with all that , you 're still there for them . That 's what hope is all about . " <p> " I ca n't do it , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from me , toward window , drawing the curtain aside to stare out at the night . " Do n't ask me to . " <p> " I 'm not asking you , " I said . " It 's not me that needs you . " <p> " You son of a bitch ! " He spun on me ; his eyes brimmed and over-flowed , but his voice was gravelled in pure anger . " Who are you to ask this of me ? Who are you ? You spend a little time among the dying and then you leave , you come back here and from the safety of a neighborhood bar you tell us how terrible it was over there , how the whole world has turned its back , how we all should be doing something . How I should be doing something . " <p> The alcohol continued to percolate in my system , growing stronger instead of weakening . My knees began buckling , popping out from under me as fast as I could right myself , and I felt as though I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could feel the first green tinge of nausea spreading up my throat , and emotional recklessness floating on its surface as it rose . <p> " Do n't expect me to feel sorry for you , " I said . " You have the one thing we all want  --  destiny . You have a purpose , you may be the only person on the face of the planet who has a real , a knowable , purpose . Not some half-baked New Age psychobabble about finding your inner child . Something true . And you 're turning your back on it . And on them . " <p> My knees gave out for good and I toppled backward onto the bed in a sprawl . I struggled to right myself , hampered by my shirt that had twisted itself in a tight cord around my body . <p> Arthur stood above me , watching me squirm , jostling pathetically with my garments . He was silent , not really looking at me . I was afraid , suddenly ; a light shone in his eyes , or maybe one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind them was not something kind , or pleasant , or benign . I had a sudden fear that he would lean down over me , bend slowly over and place his hands around my throat and squeeze , as if he were testing the day 's fruit shipment . And I remembered , with a kind of psychic clarity as if the pages of a book were opened in front of me , that Arthur had killed the babies of Britain . In the legend , he had drown them all , trying to destroy his son . <p> " I 'm sorry , " I said . " I know you probably want me to go . I 'll just  --  " My hands kept slipping from beneath me when I put my weight on them , stranding me on the bed beneath him , under the weight of his gaze . <p> " Do n't be stupid , " he said finally . " You wo n't get very far in that condition . Besides , you 're my guest . Where I come from , that sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you never kick a guest out . No matter how obnoxious he is . " He stepped toward the door , his hand on the light switch . " You take the bed . I 'll sleep on the couch . If you 're sick , you clean it up . " <p> He shut the light off but hesitated in the doorway , silhouetted against the glow spilling down the hall from the living room , his outline fuzzy in the near-darkness . I gurgled my thanks and lay my head back , closing my eyes . <p> " You 're wrong , though , " he said , and it seemed to come from some place far off and fast slipping away as I drifted toward sleep . " It 's not destiny . It 's damnation . " <p> He might have left then , but I was gone before he was . <p> The next morning the couch and the apartment were empty . <p> After two days , at the urging of his friends and employees , we called the police . I told them an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  that he 'd let me sleep off my binge  --  but nothing of the conversation . No one asked what had hung in the empty frame on the bedroom wall , and I did n't volunteer the information . <p> About a year and a half later I went back to England , to cover the war again now that the tide had turned , and the English seemed to be holding their own . Everywhere I went I asked about him , sometimes by name , sometimes by description , sometimes by deed , and in every town and village , on every front and every battlefield , they had seen someone fitting that description . But he had disappeared in the fighting or been killed and buried in a mass grave with all the others , and no one could ever tell me in which one , or which of the bodies was his . <p> ILLUSTRATION <p> <p> By Carroll Brown <p> Carroll Brown made his first short story sale to F &SF; ( " The Borderlands , " published in December 1995 ) . He returns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he writes , " Like a lot of sf/f fans , I grew up on King Arthur and had several ideas for stories about him floating around in my head/or years . This is not the one I would have predicted I 'd write , but in watching the news and reading the paper , it makes you realize how different a place the world is now than it must have been ' then ' in the days of glory . And then you think again and realize it probably was n't any different at all . " <p>
