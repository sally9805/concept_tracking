Johnny Carson and Ted Koppel have gone to bed and so has the Ziploc talking finger . But late night is when TV 's hucksters really get humming . Amazing baldness cures and miracle weight-loss plans . Kitchen tools and anticellulite treatments . Self-help courses and get-rich-quick schemes . Stick around : you 'll learn all about Citrus Miracle , a spray cleaner made from " 100% natural oranges , " able to wipe out everything from oven grease to carpet stains . Or share a few teary minutes with Richard Simmons as he travels the country getting testimonials from converts to his Deal-a-Meal diet plan . Or learn how fulfilling your life can be with the Brain Supercharger , a set of self- improvement tapes ( $149.95 ) that promise to raise your I.Q. and bring you " meaningful and lasting love relationships . " <P> Not since the legendary Veg-O-Matic ( " It slices ! It dices ! " ) has TV advertising been so gloriously tacky . The reason is a burgeoning genre known as the infomercial . These are program-size commercials that are disguised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they are produced entirely by an advertiser whose goal is to get viewers to reach for the phone and dial that ever present 800 number . In order to make these pitches seem like actual shows worth watching , they feature bright-eyed hosts , enthusiastic studio audiences and bogus names like Incredible Breakthroughs and Amazing Discoveries . They are increasingly populated with celebrities . Victoria Principal , Ali MacGraw , John Ritter , Art Linkletter , Fran Tarkenton , Meredith Baxter and Cathy Lee Crosby are among the stars who moonlight as salespeople in the wee hours . <P> Infomercials got their initial boost in 1984 , when the Federal Communications Commission freed local stations from limits on the amount of commercial time they could air . Hundreds of local broadcast stations , as well as such national cable networks as Lifetime and Black Entertainment Television , now carry at least some infomercials , usually in the late-night hours . For TV stations , these program-length ads provide a tidy source of revenue from little watched time periods . ( Half an hour of postmidnight airtime can bring in between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advertiser with a steam iron or self-help course to flog , an infomercial can be a good way to corral viewers for a long , hard sell . A 30-minute ad for a hand mixer from Kitchenmate cost just $125,000 to make and has generated $55 million in sales , according to its producer , the Guthy-Renker Corp . Altogether , infomercials generated $500 million in sales last year ; that figure is expected to increase to $800 million by 1992 . <P> The tacky look and hyperbolic claims of these ads have made many station executives uncomfortable with them . But not uncomfortable enough to refuse them . Infomercial telecasts have increased from 2,500 a month in 1985 to more than 21,000 today . " Most people are holding their nose but taking the money , " says an executive at New York 's WNBC-TV . " It 's a lure and a curse . "
