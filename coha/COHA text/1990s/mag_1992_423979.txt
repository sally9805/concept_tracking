A Special Report From a Symposium Sponsored by American Heritage , Forbes and Merrill Lynch THE INVESTMENT STRATEGY FOR THE 1990s A ROUNDTABLE DISCUSSION <p> Today 's global marketplace offers new opportunities for investors to expand their horizons beyond national borders . Technology is obliterating traditional barriers . Thanks to the computer , we can send billions of dollars overseas and back again in a second . As international investment options have increased , so has the information required to understand those options . Individual investors have to educate themselves about foreign accounting and foreign tax laws . They have to be aware of currency risks , as well as political and economic shifts in governments . The information needed to invest in global markets has grown exponentially as the technology to facilitate this kind of investing has grown . <p> Where are these trends leading us as individual investors ? What are the pros and cons of international investing ? What are the risks involved ? What instruments are appropriate for the individual investor , and which are more suited to the province of the professional ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry leaders met to discuss current trends and future prospects for international investing . American Heritage , Forbes and Merrill Lynch sponsored the event . Highlights of the discussion follow . <p> Moderator Jonathan Davis , marketing consultant and host of the new PBS series Thinking About the City : International investing 30 , 40 or 50 years ago was seen as something much riskier and less liquid that gave a lower return than a U.S. investment . How is the situation different today ? <p> John L. Steffens , Executive Vice President , Private Client Group , Merrill Lynch &; Co. , Inc. : International investing has been around , successfully , for quite some time . But frankly , the U.S. investor has not taken advantage of it . In 1970 the U.S. market represented approximately 70% of what was then the market capitalization of the world . Today it represents about 35% . The international index outperformed the U.S. market in the ' 60s , ' 70s , ' 80s , and so far , in the ' 90s . During that period , interesting shifts in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , investing $10,00O in the U.S. market would have returned $35,000 . Investing that same $10,000 in the number one performing market in each year would have returned approximately $1,400,000 . <p> Davis : That the U.S. portion of world capitalization shrank from 70 ' % to 35% in a period of approximately 20 years is surprising . How do you account for that ? <p> Arthur Zeikel , President and Chief Executive Officer of Merrill Lynch Asset Management : Clearly , beginning in the ' 60s , both the Japanese and the German economies began to develop more vibrancy . Other countries around the world developed their infrastructure and their marketbased thinking . Since the early ' 80s this shift has also been accelerated , with the rest of the world moving toward capitalism , free-market economies and a new form of political and economic thinking . The case for international investing , from my perspective , rests fundamentally on this enormous sea change that the world is living through . When a nation embraces free-market economics , whether it 's Portugal , Thailand , Singapore , Malaysia or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital markets development occurs . So it 's not surprising that the U.S. portion of world equity capitalization has declined . My guess is that it will continue to decline over the next few years . <p> Jeremy J. Siegel , Professor of Finance , The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania : I think that analysis is on target . I did a careful study of the data , from January 1970 through January 1992 , which showed that the average compound dollar return in the U.S. , including reinvested dividends , was about 1O.8% . For foreign stocks , on a valuated basis , it was about 13.7% per year . This difference is mostly reflected by a 2.4% per year appreciation of foreign currencies against the dollar . I 'm very enthusiastic about foreign investing on the equity side , not as enthusiastic on bonds and fixed income . On the equity side , I feel that people are dreadfully underinvested . <p> Davis : Mr. Buntrock , so far we 've been talking from the point of view of the individual investor . As the founder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and say , ' We should be overseas " ? <p> Dean L. Buntrock , Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Waste Management Inc. : No , it was simpler than that . We went public in 1971 . The following year , the U.S. went into a recession . There 's only been one time in our 21-year history when we have n't had the capital to grow our business , and that was the recession of 1972 . We could n't use our stock for acquisition because of its low value level , and we did n't care to sell it to raise capital , so we started to pursue a contract in Saudi Arabia , rumored to be worth half a billion dollars . We eventually won that contract , and suddenly we were known as more than just a Midwest garbage company . Because we were recognized as being a global company , our stock increased significantly . last year , on our 20th birthday , our company was ranked 50th in the world in market capitalization value . <p> Davis : I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the technology of how equity is traded and of how investments are made . <p> Siegel : Clearly there 's been a liquidity explosion in the rest of the world , where markets are very active . I think one of the most important aspects of international investing is diversification . We gain in the long run by diversifying and taking advantage of the superior returns that are available in the world markets . And now , with such high liquidity , investors have access to mutual funds , managed funds and closed-end funds . There are great opportunities for the average investor . <p> Steffens : I agree that diversification is very important to these markets . I would also argue that it 's important to be looking at overweighting and underweighting some of the more attractive markets . If you were smart enough in the last few years to figure out that you should be underweighted in Japan , your international performance would have been much better . We 've talked about asset allocation in various industries . I think that one of the challenges of the ' 90s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as industries . And when we add currency concerns , it clearly is going to mean that having some level of diversification is going to be critical to success in international investing . <p> Davis : We 've been speaking about getting into other markets . If I understand it correctly , in order for American companies to operate internationally , there sometimes has to be some bending of local rules , which results in a hybrid market . This combines , for instance , rules that reflect SEC policy and rules that reflect the policies of the London Stock Exchange . Would anyone like to comment on that ? <p> Buntrock : I think that 's reflective of what is really changing , globally , right now . Waste Management International did a Merrill Lynch-managed initial public offering this spring , one of the largest ever on the London Stock Exchange , at a very market-sensitive time . It was just a few days before the British elections , and a number of political decisions were pending in Europe as well . We had decided the London Exchange was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if they could compromise on several points . These were not material compromises , but rules specific to their internal needs . We found that not only were they very cooperative , our own SEC was also extremely cooperative , so that we could meet our requirements to stay within our schedule and maintain our offering dates . Based on that experience , I think that all the stock exchanges will become much more flexible in order to compete in global markets . <p> Davis : What we seem to be moving toward is a global market where rules will be similar enough so that people can function in different geographic areas . Technology will allow 24-hour trading . Would that be an accurate way to characterize it ? <p> Buntrock : Waste Management Inc. has worked for 20 years promoting an international market for our stock . We 're listed on the Australian Stock Exchange , the Tokyo Stock Exchange , the Swiss Stock Exchanges , in London , in Toronto and now in Germany . We 've made at least one European trip every year , going directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went public in 1971 , we sold quite a bit of our initial public offering in Europe , particularly in Scotland , that 's still held today . We 've been held , globally , outside of this country , as much as 25% at one time , and always over 15%. 1 believe that if non-U.S . companies want us as investors , they 're going to have to do what we did , and . come here . They have to realize that they ca n't rely just on a prospectus . Investors really want to see the officers of a company . They want to get to know the company , to be able to ask questions directly . <p> Zeikel : That 's an extremely important trend that will encourage a greater flow of U.S. investment abroad . International companies in the ' 70s did not practice financial public relations or financial disclosure the way it is practiced in the U.S. Accounting was sketchy and non-uniform . Culturally , it 's still very difficult for some management teams to open up and recognize that they have an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They have to respond to questions of financial disclosure , to questions of adversity . This is a new ball game . <p> Davis : Is it accurate to say , then , that as the markets in different parts of the world become more alike , they 're becoming more like the American market ? <p> Zeikel : I think it 's clear that the U.S. markets have set the standard , in terms of SEC supervision , in terms of accounting responsibility and , more recently , in terms of director and shareholder intrusion into what was traditionally a non-scrutinized avenue of activity . <p> Steffens : Clearly , I think the trends are going that way . There will be a narrowing of differences from a regulatory , accounting and information-flow standpoint that should be positive . <p> Siegel : It is in their best interest to present the kind of information that places the best value on their company if they want to market their stock . I agree that most major markets are driven by the individual investors within the country . But I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's beginning to determine prices in the markets of smaller countries . The amount of capital coming in to emerging markets is enormous compared to what 's there . A push of l% or 2% into those markets , and they can explode and become overvalued . The world investor is really going to be determining the marginal valuation . While in the major markets , Japan , Europe as a whole and the U.S. , it 's the sentiment of the individual . <p> Zeikel : I agree . That is again a phenomenon of professional investors looking at the world and devoting some portion of their portfolio to these opportunities that crop up . Information flow and financial public relations awareness are still largely institutional phenomena . The individual investor is to a large extent uninvolved . Analysis indicates that in the U.S. , individuals probably do not invest more than 3% of their portfolio in international equities . The information flow is only now developing rapidly enough to make the individual investor aware of the opportunities , the risks of the selection , and the methodology of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market . <p> Siegel : The Securities &; Exchange Commission is battling with the New York Stock Exchange about listing foreign shares . The NYSE wants the SEC to liberalize the requirements that are imposed on international companies that want to be listed . I think the NYSE is right . I believe that it would add to the liquidity , both for institutional investors and for individuals . I think there is going to be a big battle coming up over this issue . <p> Zeikel : One point I would like to make is that no amount of technological development , market liquidity or information flow will eliminate the excesses driven by human emotion and the extremes that investors of all kinds will drive stock values to , both up and down . So while it 's comforting to think that liquidity will deepen , and that information will improve , and that people will understand how to pronounce the names of these stocks , there 's no way investing will ever be devoid of human emotions , which will drive these issues to extremes . <p> Davis : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at Eastern Europe ? <p> Zeikel : Eastern Europe is an exciting political arena . But from an economic point of view , these are essentially very small countries that offer a limited experience in terms of investment opportunity . Czechoslovakia has only 12 million people . Poland , Romania , Bulgaria , Albania , Czechoslovakia and Hungary collectively do not make up what 's going on in southern China today . If you want to look at economic development in an embryonic stage , where investment opportunity will be inordinately different 20 years from now , I think you have to look at southern China , Hong Kong , Taipei , other parts of Southeast Asia and India . These are big countries that have enormous economic potential . The question is : Will they realize it ? <p> Steffens : What you see going on in Eastern Europe is a groping for identity . This interferes with the progress of economic development . I 'd argue that for at least the next five years those countries will have to be viewed as emerging markets . Look at what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's Singapore , which is 76% Chinese ; Taiwan , 98% Chinese ; and Hong Kong , 98% Chinese . Most of what 's going on successfully in Malaysia has a Chinese orientation to it . Add China itself and what 's happening in southern China , and you 've got almost 1.5 billion people , as well as a market that is going to offer two significant benefits . One is going to be internal growth . Anything that helps that GNP growth rate is positive . The other is that this is an area where people are going to make major investments in terms of plants , using relatively inexpensive but in many cases , well-qualified labor forces . Motorola , for instance , recently agreed to put a plant in China , a $300 million investment . This area is at least five years ahead of Eastern Europe . <p> Buntrock : A point worth discussing is global privatization . Capital is going to go where it can get the best return , and the best return is going to come globally where there 's privatization , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's been taking place in France for the last five or six years . And the Pacific Rim is another good example . Capital is always going to search these things out . <p> Davis : Let 's take a look at the sort of return that someone can expect by investing globally . <p> Siegel : As I said before , U.S. stocks have come in at 10.8% on a compound annual return basis over the last 20 years . Non-U.S . stocks have come in at 13.7% . This 2% or 3% increase compounded over that many years means you nearly double the value of your assets . <p> Steffens : An interesting way to look at this is in making certain country-by-country judgments in terms of overvaluation and undervaluation , judgments that are going to come about because of changes in political or economic views . It 's very interesting to me to see that in the last two years , Hong Kong has gone up about 40% a year , while in the same period of time its next-door neighbor , Japan , has gone down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for international investing is made on the basis of diversification . Even if foreign returns are the same as U.S. returns , they 're not completely in phase , and you get what we academics call " diversification benefit . ' The average investor could commit more to equity and , in general , reduce his risk . <p> Zeikel : This rests on the principle that the world markets are not in complete synchronization with one another . And that the correlation of returns , or the performance of different markets , is not exactly similar . As one goes up , the other one comes down . In a sense , this balancing off reduces the volatility of return , and from an investment viewpoint , increases the risk-return trade-off . That has been the classic , fundamental case for international investing . But my argument rests on a different foundation . <p> I 'm always reluctant to argue that there 's something new and different going on , because I 'm a big believer in the repetitiveness of cycles and the repetitiveness of history . But I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retrospect as truly a new area of international political and global economic thinking . And that is the acceptance of market-based principles around the world . There is not a single , semi-industrialized country that is not embracing what used to be the American ideal of doing business and having a profit incentive , as well as reducing the involvement of government in business activities . These tendencies not only increase economic activity but also political and economic freedom . What you have is a new world economy that requires investors to participate in this trend . <p> Davis : How do the foreign markets view this infusion of American capital ' <p> Zeikel : It 's a cyclical phenomenon . In the early stages of development , you want foreign investors ; in the later stages , you do n't want them . Imported capital helps develop a nation in the early stages . We should always keep in mind that America was essentially financed with foreign capital . The first junk bond was the Revolutionary War bond . All economic development , by definition , is started to some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very transitory thing . There is always a risk in any of these markets that the host country will become less hospitable toward foreign investing than it was the day you made the investment . <p> Siegel : One concern a lot of investors have is that if the U.S. takes a very unpopular international political position , there could possibly be retaliation by other nations , such as seizing America-owned assets . <p> Zeikel : I think the concern that stimulates the most reluctance is lack of awareness of the potential benefit , and the risk-return trade-off . It 's a lack of knowledge that really creates the reluctance to invest abroad , and a lack of appreciation of all the things we 're talking about , rather than these individual risk elements that do exist . <p> Buntrock : It 's really amazing to me , from Waste Management 's experience of being an investor in 23 countries , how accepted and easy it is for us today . The exception is a few countries that traditionally are more difficult to enter . In most other countries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Okay , I 'm persuaded . The returns are attractive . The risks are tolerable , or might actually be less than the risks would be of not investing . The markets are sufficiently liquid that I 'm not afraid I 'll be stuck with a worthless piece of paper . What do I do ? How do I add a global component to my portfolio ? <p> Steffens : There are almost unlimited ways to do that . American Depositary Receipts are one way . Thirty years ago there were probably a handful of ADRs . Now there are almost 1,400 or 1,500 of them . You can invest on an individual stock basis . There has clearly been an explosion in closed-end funds . If you want to invest in Germany , for instance , there are five or six choices there . Rather than looking at strictly closed-end funds , we feel it makes more sense to look at what we call " regional funds . " A European fund instead of a German fund . A Latin American fund rather than a Mexican fund . And in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funds have been created that give you the ability to invest in either equity or fixed income around the globe , with specific identification of countries , regions or even industries . <p> Davis : Does anyone have an opinion on the difference between stock and debt , overseas . <p> Siegel : As enthusiastic as I am about international stock investing , I do n't tend to be as enthusiastic about international bond investing , and particularly , short-term fixed assets . I know all these global money funds appear attractive when the U.S. has a 3 1/2% interest rate . But I 've just seen too many people sucked into an international money market without being fully cognizant of the currency risks , which are very , very high . I would much rather see someone who 's willing to take that sort of exchange risk go into stocks , where the return is going to be much better . Money market assets are the temporary abodes of purchasing power in every country . The dollar is low , and could go even lower . But it could snap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wipe out all the gain over a year on those currency funds . Bond funds are a little better . But even then , the risk is much greater abroad . Of course , if you 're a person who has a really good sense of where the dollar is going to go and which currencies are going to be strong , then you 're going to do well in foreign currencies . But with stocks , the extra currency risk is minimal in comparison with the returns that you 're going to get , overall . Stocks , in my opinion , overwhelm fixed-income investments , especially in foreign markets . <p> Davis : I suspect that one way to take the first step is to invest in a company that 's doing business overseas . <p> Buntrock : Because of the risk factors we 've discussed , I think that 's been the traditional way . The trend is definitely moving toward mutual funds , or using more sophisticated money managers to invest not just in U.S. companies , but in leading companies in the global markets . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial service community must educate the average investor . <p> Steffens : The international educational program that this symposium represents is part of a broader educational program . Our average client portfolio today is less than 30% in equities . What we 're trying to do is to encourage our clients in general to take a longerterm , broader position in equities as a whole . <p> Even in the U.S. market we are underinvested on a long-term basis . We are trying to encourage our investors to appreciate the long-term benefit of equities in a portfolio , to look at their portfolio on a total-return basis over a long period of time and , as part of that , to expand their international portion . A very important part of the education process is teaching not only about international equities , but about equities in general . We 'd like to move the equity share up from 30% to 45% over time , on a long-term , disciplined , sustained basis . <p> Siegel : I totally agree . People are definitely underinvested , for the long run , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For people saving for retirement , for a 20-or 30-year holding period , equities are definitely the place to be , and foreign equities should be a significant share . But the first major battle is to convince people to invest in stocks . That they 'll do even better on an international basis is the icing on the cake . <p> Davis : What about the issue of taxation , from the point of view of the individual investor ? <p> Steffens : Obviously the investor gets two types of returns . He gets dividend and interest income , and secondly , a capital gain or loss . Basically , capital gains and losses are not treated any differently than if you had purchased a U.S. security . The potential foreign taxes on dividend and interest are going to vary by country . Filling out your tax return becomes a little more complicated , and in most cases , you receive a tax credit for the tax you 've already paid for that particular flow of funds . We probably over-worry about tax considerations , and frankly , making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Davis : The elections are coming up . Would anyone like to volunteer anything about the implications of following different economic policies for the health of American investments in the world economy , depending on which policy is pursued ? <p> Steffens : I think we have to be concerned about the lessons of history in terms of looking at closed markets versus open markets . As we look at the concept of an international marketplace , I think that we would be very hard-pressed to have satisfactory economic results if in fact we think we are going to close our markets . We live in a global environment . That fact is going to play an important role in our domestic affairs , whether we like it or not . Understanding that and making it a part of our strategic direction is going to be very , very important . <p> The views expressed by Professor Siegel are his own and do not represent those of The Wharton School , which appears for identification purposes only . <p> TOP-PERFORMING MARKETS The Top Five Markets in Percent Growth from Previous Year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AMERICAN DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS ( ADRs ) : Securities issued by a major U.S. bank ( the depository bank ) that represent ownership in a specific number of shares of a company located outside the United States .
