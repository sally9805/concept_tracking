Section : A SPECIAL REPORT Not often . But sometimes you get your revenge . <p> Is THERE ANYTHING IN YOUR LIFE-ANYTHING small-scale  --  that irritates you ? <p> Question number two : If so , is it something that irritated you yesterday but today you 've got more or less used to it ? Like afternoon mail delivery that used to be morning mail delivery ? Like the incidence of potholes on the road that , you swear it ! , used to be ballroom-smooth ? <p> Then ask yourself : Is the acceptance of what used-to-annoy a hallmark of your maturity ? Of your ability  --  as the years roll byto weigh in with the cosmos and transcend life 's lesions now mere pinpricks ? Or do we have here evidence of an atrophy of the democratic sensibility ? The sensibility that arouses us to correct what is wrong , or misfitting . <p> We are talking about that little enzyme in the freeman 's spirit which , when truly agitated , keeps man free ! Energetic protest is the footwork of civic responsibility . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( we sigh ) is mostly outside our reach . And we ca n't do anything about high taxes or phony rhetoric . But there are the lesser things to complain about . Did you ever feel the joy of effective protest ? <p> Well I did . Air travel is the great shared experience of modern Americans , 6oo million of whom , cumulatively , boarded an airplane last year . My little victory is not to be mistaken for a heroic catalyst of reform . It was n't a transforming speech by Winston Churchill . It was less than the productive stubbornness of Columbus at the wheel . Yet when the spirit flags and we wonder whether anything can be done about the abrasions of modern life , I for one think of Eastern Airlines . <p> It was in 1969 ( I think ) and the flight out of La Guardia was on Eastern Airlines , destination Miami . Lunch was served and I asked the attendant for a glass of wine . <p> On the general subject of drink and air travel , the diversion of wine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readily accessible . No matter how blase we have become , the unnerving thought can scurry through the mind as we look out of the porthole that , really , we are complicit in an egregious effrontery on the laws of nature . What are we doing up here at 10,000 feet as though we were seagulls ! A little of the grape helps to offload concern for the laws of gravity . <p> The stewardess told me that there was no wine on that flight . " Eastern does n't serve wine on flights to Miami . " But , she added quickly , if I took an Eastern flight to Mexico , I would be given wine to drink . I was unbelieving and could n't wait to drop a note to the president of Eastern , who confirmed the company 's new policy : No wine on any flight that lasts less than three hours . <p> I took on that ruling , in the springtime of a life of diminishing resolution , as a challenge . I made mention of Eastern 's measured abstinence in a newspaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I did better than that . For many months thereafter , flying to Miami as I then regularly had to do , I would drop postcards to the president ( of Eastern ) , describing the wines being served aboard my National Airlines flights to Miami . <p> Some months later , a messenger from Eastern arrived at my office with a huge basket  --  of fruit , delicacies and half-bottles of wine  --  to which was attached a note from the president saying , simply , and rather sweetly , I thought , " We surrender . " <p> We become spoiled , enjoying the miracle of flight as workaday . The accepted axiom is that you remember the good parts of life . The mother thinks not of birth pain but of birth , the father not of the hours of work and anxiety , but of the offspring 's college degree . In air travel it 's the other way around : It is the thorns that nestle in the memory , not the wonderful conveniences of swift travel . Everyone has an airplane story recording @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I especially remember a flight aboard Viasa . <p> It was terribly hot , that afternoon in Rio , and the preflight bureaucratic atmosphere was oppressive . Checked baggage required forms completed in quadruplicate . There was only the single air-conditioned room in the entire airport ( this was 1977 ) . And our flight , coming in from Caracas , was two and-a-half hours late . <p> Finally it took off . We were bound for Buenos Aires , the sun was down and I turned on the reading light , pulling up my portable typewriter to write my column . Only a faint glow ensued , reminding me of the movie of Mrs. Miniver in wartime London during the Blitz , coping with blackout security conditions . Questioned , the stewardess expressed great surprise : No one has ever complained before ! You struggle to say something original but the best you can come up with , in your fatigue , is , " Well-haha-that record is now broken ! " <p> There was nothing she could do to magnify the light , she said . Never mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , in a cabin lightly occupied , sat empty . So I sat down with my portable to enjoy the sharp overhead light . <p> In stormed the Jefe de Cabina . " This lounge is reserved for the crew , " he scowled . Surely not , you demur : It is clearly an amenity for the passengers traveling first class , and an especially welcome one , given the wan lighting over the passenger seats . He settled the question by reaching up to a switch in a recessed corner of the cabin and suddenly UNFLASH ! R the lounge is dark . <p> But my revenge was sweet . I did not in those days , nor in fact do I now , need any light at all to work a keyboard ; so there and then , high over the South Atlantic Ocean , I tapped out my newspaper column to my 300 clients for the following day , devoting it not to world affairs , but to life aboard Viasa . It provoked , I am reminded , a large ad a few days later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . WILLIAM F. BUCKLEY , JR . <p> The text , highly personalized , was in fact charming . The disputed matter of the lounge was handled with " Since our First Class passengers are certainly entitled to it the lounge and , should your statement be true to fact , it certainly would justify strong criticism . " The ad ( signed by a Viasa vice president ) concluded with a fraternal touch . " I remember that on the occasion of your visit to Caracas , September last , I was introduced to your charming wife , Pat , and to you , at that party that our lovely hostess , Mrs. Mimi Herrera , held on September 3oth at Hacienda La Vega . When your wife heard that I was connected with Viasa , she most graciously and spontaneously  --  and before a number of people  --  went out of her way to praise the service she had received on Viasa the day before coming from New York , and even went to the extent of asking me if we had flights from New York to Europe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the first-class lounge , it was ceded by public notice to the first-class passengers . This was , I supposed , conveyed to the Jefe de CaNna . <p> But as grievances mount , we worry over the question : Do complaints have any effect ? The airline industry is entitled to a little sympathy , given the large sums of money it lost during the mid- ' 9os . But now the planes are full , and grievances accumulate . There are two classes of these . If you do not like the care and attention given to you in one grocery store , you patronize another . You can not do this in protest against mail deliveries in the afternoon , and it is only on certain routes that you can drop one airline in protest , and travel on another . <p> On the matter of straitened legspace and diminished inclination of seat backs , there is little to be done . For a while , airline passenger congestion was excused on the grounds of the soaring price of fuel . After OPEC lost that war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passengers . Dramatic attempts at improvement have been attempted , I am told by those who have experienced Virgin Atlantic and Midwest Express . The ambitious effort by MGM Grand Air ( celebrated in these pages ) that flew you for a couple of years New York-Los Angeles , finally abandoned its volupmary five-hour journey  --  not enough clients , even though the first-class fare was set at exactly the fare of the regular carriers . <p> But even though the airlines are going to prevail , for the simple reason that alternative means of getting from Chicago to Atlanta are n't going to materialize , one likes to think that protests can make their way to the hearts and minds of management . <p> Ah , but will they ? That 's the important question here asked . Unless protests can be seen to make a difference , the fatalistic alternative  --  resignation-clutches in . Two years ago I caught a Delta Airlines 8 p.m. flight , Atlanta-New York . I was hot and famished . The fare offered was : pretzels . I wrote a note and dispatched it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrawled out on my note , " I completely agree with you . " The next day I sent a letter to the president of Delta and included in it not the name of the captain , whom I wished to protect against the charge of mutinous conduct , but the text of the message he had returned to me . I got back a form reply , to the effect that anyone who has boarded an Atlanta flight at eight and has n't eaten dinner is an isolated and negligible problem . My suggestion that a high-school Atlanta entrepreneur should be granted a franchise to sell in-flight Tootsie Rolls and Oreo cookies was not taken seriously , though I note that the president of Delta was removed days after my letter to him was delivered . <p> There is the vexing matter of airline ticket prices . " It is a bazaar , airplane tickets , " the editor of this journal has noted . The market is understandably sovereign in the matter of airline ticket prices , but it is also true that although computers can store up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of human exasperations , which is what happens when the passenger seated at 14A who paid $210 discovers that his neighbor at 14B paid $49-95 . The indignation is over the opportunistic airline device of penalizing those who do not dawdle in town over Saturday nights after completing their business . Are we complaining about this with sufficient force ? <p> There is the business of overweight . A bright and litigious young lawyer , 27 years ago , challenged the airlines ' extraordinary policy of charging , for every pound over the allowed 44 , approximately one half of 1% of the first-class fare ; which resulted in such anomalies as exposure , with 220 pounds of overweight , to a surcharge at the ticket counter equal to a full first-class fare . Donald L. Pevsner , Esquire , persuaded the Civil Aeronautics Board that given the baggage capacity of jet aircraft , the old rules punitively limiting overweight were unjustified . So now we pay a set price for extra pieces of luggage , up to a maximum limit of 70 pounds . But  --  sometimes you pay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is not welcome , day to day , checking in at airports . <p> State and national political plebiscites on policy questions and political candidates are fine , and sometimes they yield satisfaction . But airline travel and the treatment one gets at airports and high in the air are probably the modern crucible by which democratic responsiveness is measured . For one thing , the aggravations are endless . You present your bags and your ticket and are asked for " an ID . " This is generally a driver 's license . You pull it from your wallet and the porter or gatekeeper glances at it and nods . Then come the questions : <p> Have you been separated from your suitcases since they were packed ? ( No . ) <p> Did anyone other than you pack the suitcases ? ( No . ) <p> Are you carrying inside the suitcases any packages for anyone that were not packed by you ? ( No . ) <p> But of course if you are contemplating mischief you are not going to reveal this to the baggage porter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward to say he had no way of telling whether someone had put something in his bag since he checked out of the hotel ? <p> During the days when U.S. Immigration worried about subversives at points of entry , one middle-aged French Intellectual with practically no knoledge of English heard the examiner ask , " Do you believe in the overthrow of the United States Government by force or violence ? " " Er , " the immigrant replied , in agony exactly to understand alternative answers to the question , " preferably by force . " That stopped the assembly line , until it was explained to him that the purpose of the question had n't been to ask whether he preferred force to violence , rather to elicit from him a comprehensive rejection of both . What would be the reply of a President asked , his hand on the Bible , " Do you forswear high crimes and misdemeanors ? " <p> When the war ended in England everyone had got used to lining up . To " queuing " up . Soldiers of course , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up diminished . There were enough eggs , the buses were n't all filled , the movie house had a few empty seats . But it proved hard to shake the habit . You get used to the exasperations of air travel . We forget to complain ; and , before you realize complaints , which are the lubricant effective self-government , ease off ; Orwell time . <p> ILLUSTRATIONS <p>
