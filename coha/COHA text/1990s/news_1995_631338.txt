Networking Return phone calls : When you do n't , it 's the silent way of saying , " You do n't count . " If you 're busy , leave a quick message to buy time for a more lengthy discussion , but get back to the person . - Michael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do something for someone else . At JobDig , we put young sales reps in mentoring roles with brand-new reps . We have simply institutionalized that which we all know works : To learn it better , teach it . -G . L. Hoffman , chairman of JobDig Practice your personal elevator pitch : Nearly every day , we are presented with an opportunity to share our personal story with someone , so make yours something to remember . A few days ago , I was in a meeting with two people who did not know each other . One said to the other : " I know about your business . Now tell me who you are . " It was a revealing question , and he got a surprising , insightful answer . - Hoffman Write a blog : It 's the easiest and fastest way to scoot up to the head of the Google search parade . In fact , the same people who say , " The business card is dead , " say , " The blog is the new rsum . " Blogs are an excellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ network . - Karen Burns , author of The Amazing Adventures of Working Girl Get discovered : You ca n't hide in your room and wait to be discovered . Your brilliance will mean little if no one outside your immediate circle knows about it . You have to make yourself discoverable . Join and participate in professional groups , serve on committees , give speeches , and break your pattern of seclusion . If you 're shy , adjust your strategy so your skills can come out in less stressful venues , such as writing articles or participating in smaller groups . - Wade Socialize : Attend the company barbecue , picnic , charity walk , softball game , and so on . These small social events can lead to big opportunities . - Andrew Rosen , founder of Jobacle.com Resumes Mistakes to avoid : When I review rsums , a surprising percentage of them go straight into the reject pile because of mistakes that could have been avoided . Some easy ways to get rejected : Your cover letter is clearly a form letter that you 're mass-mailing , and it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your name as " Sexy Mama " or similar ilk ; spelling mistakes and typos ; your rsum lists an objective totally unrelated to the position I have open ; your cover letter does n't address the fact that you 're wildly overqualified or totally inexperienced . - Alison Green , hiring manager and blogger at AskaManager.blogspot.com Be specific : " Most people just write in very general terms that speak not only to what they did but what anyone has ever done in the history of that position . . . . I tell people that within each section of your rsum , in each job you write about , you want to have at least four or five numbers that quantify what you 've done . " - Brad Karsh , founder of JobBound and former Leo Burnett recruiter Stop with the letters of recommendation : Do n't attach them to your rsum , and do n't offer them up at the interview . I know you feel good about them , but , unfortunately , they are n't useful . Shocking , but true . Here 's why : When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk to your references , we want to talk to them -- on the phone , where we can ask questions and probe around . We want to hear their tone , hear where they hesitate before answering , and hear what happens when we dig around about potential problem areas . - Green Interviewing Show initiative : Prior to the interview , ask if there is some problem the company is working on that you can present a solution for . This is somewhat radical , but imagine how well you 'll be received if you walk into the interview with a proposal for the company 's biggest problem . This just shouts , " EvilHRLady.blogspot.com Look after details : We can be quickly undone by small things , including the unshined shoes at the job interview . People can easily conclude that the lapse reflects a lack of caring . - Wade Look the part : Unless you are applying for a job someplace where tattoos and micro-miniskirts are prevalent , cover yours ( tattoos and your thighs ) up . Dress one step above what you see other employees wearing . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prior to the interview date. ) - Lucas Time it right : It 's good to plan to arrive early , so you have a buffer against being late . But kill those extra 20 minutes at a nearby coffee shop , not in the company 's reception area . Many interviewers are annoyed when candidates show up more than five or 10 minutes early , since they may feel obligated to interrupt what they 're doing and go out to greet the person , and some ( like me ) feel vaguely guilty leaving someone sitting in their reception area that long . Aim to walk in five minutes early but no more than that . - Green Be real : Claiming your biggest weakness is perfectionism and that you work too hard is disingenuous and looks as if you 're avoiding the question . Candidates who ca n't or wo n't come up with a realistic assessment of areas where they could improve make me think they 're lacking in insight and self-awareness -- or , at a minimum , they 're just making it impossible to have a real discussion of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at ease : Strive to make your seemingly powerful interviewer feel comfortable -- even happy -- in your presence . A great many interviewers hate interviewing . They know they 're not good at it , and they are dealing with strangers and asking questions to fill a job with which they are unfamiliar . Be friendly . Pay attention to eye contact . Listen carefully to what is said , and if a question is unclear , seek clarification by rewording it . If some glitch arises , laugh it off . Be wary of challenging a question unless it is patently offensive . Stress your ability to work with others , and then behave like a person who can do so . Let your body language signal that you are both professional and amiable . - Wade Beware of gotcha questions : A favorite gotcha question might be " Where would you really like to work ? " Now is not the time to give some other company 's name -- your sought-after place to work is right here . No one wants to be the candidate 's second choice . - Hoffman Better Pay At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your salary history ? " You want to say , " It 's really none of your business . " But it 's hard to pull that off without sounding snarky . Instead , you could say , " I 'm pretty flexible about salary . However , I do believe that my compensation should be commensurate with my value to your company . What 's your salary range , by the way ? " Or , " I 've done a lot of research and learned that the going rate for this job ranges from X to Y thousand dollars . What 's your salary range , by the way ? " - Burns Ask for more work before you ask for more money : This is a sensitive topic because a lot of bosses will take this as a sign that they are not managing you well . But you need to show that you can handle more -- in addition to handling your current workload . I know there are tons of projects around that someone can and should do . Be the one who gets those extra projects . - Hoffman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good enough . Pay attention to your company 's health , and be willing to change jobs if necessary , keep your skills up , and make your boss happy . - Lucas Make your work a research project : As you go about your work , ask yourself questions like : What do I love about this ? Why ? What drives me nuts about this ? What do I care about in my work ? What feels important ? Where do I shine ? What lets me shine ? Where do I fall flat ? What 's behind that ? The more you know who you are and what makes you tick , the easier it is to make decisions that will play to your strengths and incorporate what energizes you . - Curt Rosengren , career coach , speaker , author , and blogger at PassionCatalyst.com Take some time off : Do an activity several times a week that is seemingly unrelated to career advancement . Exercise is probably the best choice since its benefits include reduced stress and increased confidence . Volunteer work can also take you away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength will be renewed , your senses sharpened , and you will find ways of getting not over but around the ledge . The key is devoting part of your time to pondering something that has nothing to do with your objective . - Wade Keep track of everything your boss puts on your plate so she learns that she does n't have to follow up to make sure thing are getting done . More broadly , have your act together . Stay on top of things , ensure that your boss only has to tell you something once , do n't let things fall through the cracks , and generally be someone she can rely on . - Green Pay attention to what kinds of questions your boss asks so you get a better understanding of the types of things she cares about . By paying attention to what she asks , seems worried about , etc. , you can often draw larger messages about the sorts of things she will care about in the future . If you learn to anticipate those things in advance and address them before she has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your jets : Upper management favors talent that is the equivalent of a safe sports car -- jazzy but within conventional boundaries . Study the successful mavericks in your organization . Learn what rules they flouted and the ones they quietly respected . - Wade Changing Careers Do n't wait : When it comes to pursuing your dreams , the notion that the time is n't right is the kiss of death . Instead of taking action to move toward the career you really want , you end up sitting and waiting . The trouble is that the perfect day when the stars align and everything is ready for comfortable change almost never comes . There is always something getting in the way . There is always something less than preferable about your circumstances . There is always something that you need to know , or do , or have , or . . . well , you get the picture . - Rosengren Consider moonlighting : It 's not as hard as it sounds . Moonlighting can be not only the answer to your underemployment woes ; it can be the path to greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elements of every job that irritate us or that we avoid because we do n't like doing them . So if you are looking for a job that is all great , all the time , you 're setting yourself up for disappointment . A more realistic goal is aiming for an 80/20 ratio . If you love what you 're doing 80 percent of the time , you 're doing pretty well . - Rosengren
