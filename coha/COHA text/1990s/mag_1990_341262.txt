Heiner Muller was once without full recognition in his own country . The East German playwright had a festival of his works this month in Frankfurt , and has been praised by international audiences for plays like Hamletmaschine and Quartett . It 's only now that his dramas , pointedly dealing with the theme of revolution betrayed , are being staged at home . If Muller , 61 , were to dramatize the end of the Communist regime in East Berlin , he says , " it would be a tragedy about incompetence and stupidity . " He adds that many figures in recent history would n't make strong fictional characters . One exception : Lenin .
