Stealing into enemy territory is always a risky venture , but Israeli military commanders did n't guess just how treacherous it would prove last week . In a botched special operation in southern Lebanon , Israel lost 11 elite commando fighters and a military doctor in a battle with local militias . It was the country 's worst one-time loss in the 12 years it has maintained its " security zone " in southern Lebanon , a 5-mile-wide strip Israel occupies ostensibly to protect its northern border from attack . The debacle will undoubtedly sharpen opposition within Israel to continuing that presence . <P> The naval force that crept onto the Lebanese coast in the blackness of last Thursday night consisted of 16 men . Some of them swam ashore ; the Lebanese found their wet suits and fins . At 12:41 a.m. , on the outskirts of the town of Insariyeh , two miles inland , a pre-planted bomb suddenly detonated in the midst of the unit . Within seconds the Israelis were raked by machine-gun fire . Eleven died , and four lay wounded , leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Soon , a rescue squad arrived by helicopter . Under heavy fire from Hizballah and Amal militiamen , as well as Lebanese army troops , the team evacuated all the commandos but one , who could not be found . An incoming mortar shell killed one of the rescuers , a doctor . A Lebanese woman and child caught in the cross fire were also killed , and six other civilians were injured , as were six Lebanese militiamen and two army soldiers . <P> Israel 's retreat around 4 a.m. without the missing commando was an agonizing one : dead and wounded are always brought home , and the decision to leave someone went all the way up to the Defense Minister and the military Chief of Staff . The Israelis concluded that the soldier , who had been carrying explosives , must have been blown to bits . Later someone from Hizballah found parts of his body and offered to trade them for Arab prisoners held by Israel . <P> Just what the Israelis were up to outside their zone in Lebanon remained unexplained . Lebanese sources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who has a house in Insariyeh and is influential in Amal , one of the Shi'ite militia groups . Israel has carried out such kidnappings before , but military insiders downplayed this theory . They hinted instead that the mission was to plant explosive devices in the area , targeted either at a nearby Hizballah post or an Amal encampment . <P> The Israeli government is mystified as to how the invasion was discovered . One possibility is that Hizballah or Amal fighters spotted the commandos early on and quickly set up the ambush . But survivors say the assault seemed well planned , lending weight to the theory that the top-secret mission had been compromised , perhaps by a Lebanese collaborator used by Israel in the operation .
