Former diplomat Barry Rosen , 55 , recalls the U.S. embassy siege : <P> I looked out . People were jumping over the walls . They had placards with Khomeini 's picture . Some had clubs . Some had automatic weapons . They blindfolded me , tied my hands and marched me to the cook 's quarters . I felt I could be executed . There was so much chaos . I thought , " Is this real ? " That night they said , " You give us the Shah , and you are free . " <P> They slapped me around in the beginning . I was n't a " good boy , " but as time went on , I learned it did n't pay to be a smart aleck . There were mock trials . I said , " I will not answer any of your questions . " The next day they marched me to a large hall . They said , " Here is a piece of paper . If you do n't answer these questions by the count of 10 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my head and started counting . <P> I try to use the siege experience for positive purposes . It has made me stronger and more understanding as a person . I want to be hopeful about U.S.-Iran relations . Abdi has apologized privately to me in a very sincere way . But it has been physiologically difficult . When I hear a car backfiring , I still jump .
