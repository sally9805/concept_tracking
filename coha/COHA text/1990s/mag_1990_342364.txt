The voting took place amid rumors of war and recession and was preceded by a budget spectacle in Washington that made many Americans wonder if their system of government was too sclerotic to survive . Various pundits thought they detected a budding anarchic streak in the voters , a sullen , throw-the-bums-out attitude toward all incumbents , good and bad , Democrats and Republicans . Some political analysts forecast a populist revolt and called for campaign reform and mandatory term limitations to help restore the public 's flagging confidence . But for all the advance drama and disquiet , when the ballots were cast and counted , the country did not seem to have changed much . <P> It might have been otherwise had President Bush not waited until after the election to announce that he was nearly doubling U.S. troop strength in the Persian Gulf . As it was , only a few sitting members of Congress were defeated , hardly enough to make more than a token difference in the composition of the Senate ( where the Democrats picked up one seat ) and the House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the most significant result involved a politician who was n't even on the ballot . For if the election of 1990 changed nothing else , it undermined the perception that George Bush is all but immune to the normal vicissitudes of politics . Suddenly , and for the first time in his presidency , Bush seemed vulnerable . <P> The weakening process began when Bush abandoned his " no new taxes " pledge and deprived Republican right-wingers of their favorite issue . Then Congress rejected the deficit-reduction package negotiated by White House aides and congressional leaders . After that , the President went from bad to worse as he alternately attacked the Democrats , tried to explain his domestic policies and confronted growing doubts about the U.S. deployment in the Persian Gulf . By the time he finally signed a budget deal last week , his performance ratings in the polls had dropped 20 points . <P> Despite his parlous political condition , Bush continued to sound his uncertain trumpet on behalf of Republican candidates . A few gave a polite " thanks , but no thanks " to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vermont Representative Peter Smith even used a presidential appearance on his behalf to dissociate himself from Bush 's policies . But most G.O.P. candidates stood dutifully beside their President , smiled and hoped for the best . None could accuse Bush of shirking . From May Day to Election Day , he made more than 100 stops for 63 candidates and helped raise about $80 million in campaign funds . The results were unimpressive . Struggling to put the best face on the outcome , a rather sheepish Bush insisted , " I 'm told we did a little better than the norm , but that does n't make me happy . "
