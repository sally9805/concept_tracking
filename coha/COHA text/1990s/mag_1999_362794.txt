If you are an underwear mogul , you surely can not lack confidence . So it is with Bill Farley . The handsome physical-fitness buff has under his belt brands like BVD , Munsingwear and his flagship , Fruit of the Loom . He rubs shoulders with the rich and powerful , and recently co-chaired a lunch that raised more than $500,000 for George W. Bush . Muscles rippling , Farley , 57 , has also shown up wearing a tank top in Fruit of the Loom advertising . He once even put himself forward as a candidate for President of the United States . <P> These days , however , Farley 's political focus is squarely on Congress , where Fruit 's adventures in lobbying offer a choice example of how the game is played . Fruit of the Loom is a tattered company , suffering from bad performance and poor management and lobbying heavily for a bill that would ripen its bottom line . <P> How likely is it that the company 's case will be heard on the Hill ? Well , last year alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a figure that puts contributions by the firm ( 1998 sales : $2.2 billion ) ahead of those of such giants as Coca-Cola , Exxon and Bank of America . Most of Fruit 's plums go to Republicans , including $265,000 to the National Republican Senatorial Committee , run by Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnell , the principal opponent of campaign finance reform . <P> This week , with Congress having for now killed campaign finance reform , McConnell and other Republicans will get on with other business , such as an amendment to an African trade bill that would allow apparel produced in the Caribbean Basin to enter the U.S. duty free , provided it is assembled from U.S. fabric . <P> Fruit 's lobbyists  --  along with those from competitors like the Sara Lee Corp. , which makes Hanes underwear , and retailers like the Limited and the Gap  --  are pushing hard for passage . Fruit officials claim the measure , which Bill Clinton supports , will create jobs , and deny that the company 's donations can buy influence . Says Ron Sorini , a Fruit lobbyist : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and those who decide to vote in favor of this bill . " <P> Whether there is or not , Farley 's much coveted tariff break comes at a cost . Eliminating duties on apparel from the Caribbean will run U.S. taxpayers at least $1 billion in lost revenue over five years  --  a figure that , by congressional rules , must be made up with cuts in other programs . <P> Fruit confirms that the bill is expected to deliver a quick $25 million to $50 million to the bottom line , adding to savings achieved after moving some 17,000 of its U.S.-based jobs , mostly to the low-wage Caribbean Basin , and reincorporating in the tax haven Cayman Islands . The job cuts were spread across the South , especially Kentucky , where earlier in this decade Fruit was one of the largest employers . " They are trying to win in Washington what they 've been unable to achieve in the marketplace , " says Charles Lewis , executive director of the Center for Public Integrity , a watchdog group . " They 're now trying to secure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dire financial straits . "
