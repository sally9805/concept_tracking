<p> The people who run Philip Morris make and sell the world 's most dangerous consumer product , one that for some victims is so addictive they keep surrendering to its lethal comfort even as they waste away . Philip Morris is the company behind Marlboro , Benson &; Hedges , Virginia Slims and Parliament cigarettes  --  in the eyes of some critics , the company might as well be selling death itself . <p> You might wonder how they live with themselves . You would n't be the first . <p> Nancy Brennan Lund is vice president in charge of the company 's flagship brand , Marlboro , an enthusiastic woman with bobbed brown hair who commutes to Manhattan from her suburban Connecticut home each morning . She recalls running into a neighbor one day who asked what she did for a living . " I said , ' Well , I run the Marlboro business for Philip Morris . ' And she said , ' You 're kidding !  --  You 're so nice ! ' <p> " I thought maybe I should show her my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these kind of social barbs that are hurtful because we are people . " <p> To survive , she says , " you have to be able to look in the mirror in the morning , put your lipstick on and say ' I 'm okay , I love what I do and it 's okay . ' " Philip Morris people do n't just tolerate their work , or rationalize it , she explains . They are proud of themselves and their company . " People in this company have made a choice to be here . " <p> There may be no better way to understand just how wide the gulf is between the tobacco people and their critics than to visit Philip Morris , America 's largest and most profitable tobacco company , and meet some of its executives . There , it becomes clear that the two sides in the cigarette wars are not just battling over facts or profits . This is a clash of moral systems . Philip Morris people believe they are fighting for something more than just life spans or cardiopulmonary health  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> A person who aspires to work for Philip Morris , says Ellen Merlo , one of the executives in charge of the company 's lobbying and public relations machine , must have " very strong values . " Philip Morris people must have " thought it through intellectually and ethically . " <p> Merlo asks potential employees whether they can square their consciences with working for a tobacco company . Some , she says , reply , " No problem . I can market anything . " <p> " Well , wrong answer , " says Merlo , a slim , dark-haired woman who exudes the self-confidence of someone who has spent three decades navigating a career in corporate Manhattan . " Wrong answer because they really were n't thinking about the issue , and that 's not good . You do n't have to believe in smoking . . . but you have to believe in your soul that this is a choice people are entitled to make . " <p> Ask them the tough ones about smoking , disease and addiction , and they go straight to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in lung and throat cancer , heart disease and emphysema , but there is no conclusive proof it causes these diseases . Nor are cigarettes addictive ; although some smokers admittedly have difficulty quitting , others readily can and do . The real issue in the debate over federal regulation of smoking is n't the need to protect the public from a dangerous product but to preserve freedom of choice , not just for smokers but for all Americans . <p> Perhaps the people who run Philip Morris have always believed these things . Or perhaps they have repeated the concepts over and over again to the point where they have come to believe them . It does n't really matter . What 's clear from spending a day talking to some of Philip Morris 's top executives about themselves and their company is that they do believe  --  truly , deeply , perhaps even madly . <p> Cynics need not apply . " Do n't come to work here if you can sell anything , " says Merlo . " That 's not good enough . " <p> Sticks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of East 41st Street and Park Avenue in Manhattan bears little resemblance to a bunker . There 's a small but expensive collection of modern art along one wall of the lobby , the guards at the front desk seem low-key , and there are subway-style turnstiles but no metal detectors . " Non Smokers and Smokers Are Welcome " reads the small sign atop the security desk . It seems more of a warning than an invitation . <p> Victor Han , vice president of external relations , enters the lobby to escort his guest to a windowless conference room on the 24th floor . Han , who is in his early forties , is the son of a prominent South Korean diplomat , and spent much of his childhood in Silver Spring , Md . He 's a little nervous this morning ; the company has not had much good press in recent years , and Han has stuck his neck out in persuading his fellow executives to allow a reporter inside for the day . <p> The conflict over smoking has become perhaps the greatest morality play of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morris , Han has been in the hot seat , responding to a wave of new lawsuits and the Food and Drug Administration 's proposal to regulate tobacco . Five federal grand juries are probing tobacco companies for perjury and fraud . Meanwhile , whistle-blowers have produced reams of documents that suggest the industry has covered up evidence about the harm and addictiveness of smoking . It 's people like Vic Han and his fellow executives who have to reply . <p> There are three glass ashtrays on the conference table , but Han is the only one who uses them . He 's been smoking since he was 15 or 16 , enjoys cigarettes , pipes and cigars . " I like the taste , I like the way they smell , I like the rituals , " he says . As for the health risks , " I 'm aware of them , but I 've made my decision that this is what I want to do . " <p> Throughout the day , he brings a stream of Philip Morris people to the conference room to explain themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She has put in 28 years at Philip Morris , and no one better articulates the philosophical worldview of the company 's people . A born New Yorker , she 's a lifelong liberal Democrat who professes sadness that her party has become a critic of her industry . An adult 's right to choose to smoke is , in her eyes , as important as a woman 's right to choose whether to have an abortion . It 's all about freedom . And she sees the crusade against smoking as part of a general decline in tolerance , which she attributes largely to the puritanical health obsessions of the baby boom generation . <p> " The thing that disturbs me the most is that society has come to the point on so many issues where if you do n't agree with the way I want to do something , you 're evil and you 're a demon , " she says . <p> As a Philip Morris executive , Merlo is confronted at times by people who do n't like who she is or what she does . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spa recently , and another guest announced that she was " really turned off " by Merlo 's job and snubbed Merlo for the rest of her stay . " My feeling was it 's her loss if she 's that small-minded , " Merlo says . " I do n't try to impose my beliefs on other people . But I have never not told people what I do . I 'm very proud of it . " <p> Of course , she has to be to take the pounding that comes with being a Philip Morris gatekeeper . She and her colleagues have been questioned , scolded , scorned , attacked and vilified . They are cautious , collected , canny and smooth . They meet with each other constantly ; whenever a public relations crisis hits they are called on to respond with solutions as well as sound bites . " We do n't just implement the programs , " says Merlo . " We 're also responsible for doing the strategic thinking . " <p> This collaboration , they say , is one of the appeals of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company , " says Merlo . " There are no **41;1018;TOOLONG kinds of things . . . . The doors in this place are always open . <p> " It 's amazing  --  we really like each other , " she says . " Sometimes I think maybe it 's because we have so much political bull we have to put up with . . . there seems to be a lack of politics internally . We come together as colleagues and we work well together . " <p> They came together rather spectacularly in February 1994 ; the FDA had announced it was considering whether to adopt restrictions to curb underage smoking . Philip Morris executives formed an FDA task force that met weekly to hatch a strategy . The three-pronged counterattack included a lawsuit challenging the agency 's powers of regulation , a voluntary company-wide program to crack down on tobacco sales to young people and a compromise proposal that would have restricted sales while denying a role to the FDA . The strategy succeeded in warding off , for now , some of the stronger parts of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tobacco business today . <p> " We 're not Pollyannas , " says Merlo . " We know how tough it is and we know what we 're up against , and sometimes it 's very hurtful to walk in and read the paper or know what people are saying . But by the same token . . . there 's a type of camaraderie that exists in this company . . . . A lot of people feel good about coming to work here . " <p> The Art of Self-Defense <p> Once upon a time , Philip Morris was a company like any other company . It manufactured only tobacco products and was run by tobacco men ( and back then they all were men ) who believed in the product and who themselves were dedicated smokers . When they were first confronted with evidence that cigarettes cause fatal disease , they tried to cling to the moral high ground by insisting they would never knowingly manufacture an unsafe product . <p> " My wife smokes , I smoke , and we certainly do n't have any fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philip Morris 's legendary marketers , told the New Yorker 's Thomas Whiteside in 1963 . " I do n't think that cigarettes will ever be found to contain anything dangerous to health . " <p> But he added , " I think if it were proved " that cigarettes caused lung cancer , " I would give up smoking . I also think I 'd get the heck out of the business . " <p> The present generation of Philip Morris executives makes no such claims . Vic Han vigorously defends the company 's right to make and sell its products . Yet he refuses to smoke when his two young daughters are around  --  not because he believes secondhand smoke is harmful , but because he does n't want them to pick up the habit . " Certainly I do n't want my kids to smoke , " he says . " As a parent I want to take as many risks out of their lives as I possibly can . " <p> Ellen Merlo began at Philip Morris in 1969 and quickly became one of Jack Landry 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closely identified with the success of the Virginia Slims women 's tennis circuit , which the company founded and nurtured . She recalls fondly a small , cozy company . <p> " When I came to work here , I thought I had just died and gone to heaven , " she says . " I mean , it was the most remarkable atmosphere . Around Christmastime we used to get together in the conference room and our various departments , we 'd have a drink before we went home on Christmas Eve . And all the guys who run the company used to come along with a cart with champagne on it and serve everybody drinks . . . . It was a very people-oriented , very caring culture even back then . And to me , the remarkable thing about this company in the 28 years that I 've been here is that as big as we got and as diverse as we got that core value never disappeared . " <p> Philip Morris was the first tobacco company to promote blacks to senior positions , and its social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South in the 1960s . It is generally recognized as the industry leader in hiring and promoting women , Hispanics and Asian Americans . There was a time when Merlo was the only woman in senior management at Philip Morris USA . Now there are five women among the 13 members of the executive committee . <p> The company donates more than $ 50 million per year to arts , education and hunger and nutrition programs  --  about one percent of its pre-tax earnings  --  and it is routinely listed among the country 's top five corporate philanthropic donors . Executives tell the story of company CEO Geoffrey Bible 's discovery last year that there was a waiting list of nearly 1,000 people for New York 's Citymeals-on-Wheels free home lunch program for the elderly . Bible wrote a corporate check for $ 1.3 million . End of waiting list . <p> Craig Johnson , a tall Texan with a southern drawl that seems slightly out of place in the corporate canyons of Manhattan , is senior vice president in charge of Philip Morris USA 's 3,000-member sales force . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when , five years ago , Philip Morris offered him a position . He says he worried that it would be immoral to work for a tobacco company . He talked to his wife , he talked to his father , he talked to his minister . But he says he found his answer when he met the people who were to become his colleagues . <p> " I wondered about what kind of people these were , " says Johnson . " And boy , I 'll tell you , the more I got to learn about these people I was overwhelmed . . . . And that 's what really convinced me that this was the right place to be . " <p> Given this sense of themselves and their company , Philip Morris people are outraged at the way their industry has been scrutinized by Congress and vilified in the media , and they have fought back with money and lawsuits . This past year the company reported spending more money than any other private entity on lobbying and campaign contributions . At its annual stockholders meeting this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be anyone 's punching bag . " <p> Their sense of us-against-the-world was sharpened when , in April 1994 , one of the industry 's most outspoken opponents , Rep. Henry A. Waxman ( D-Calif. ) , summoned the chief executive officers of the seven largest tobacco companies to appear before his subcommittee on health and the environment . <p> Although the executives had carefully rehearsed , things went wrong from the opening moment , when subcommittee staffers lined up the seven like defendants at Nuremberg , their hands raised to be sworn in . Democratic lawmakers hurled hostile , and at times self-righteous , questions , and punctuated the answers from the CEOs with exclamations of disbelief . <p> Perhaps the most telling moment came when William Campbell , then president of Philip Morris USA , was asked by Ron Wyden ( D-Ore . ) : " Would you want your kids or your grandkids to smoke or not smoke " when they become adults ? <p> Campbell replied : " I have no preference . I have no preference . " <p> Of all the evasions that day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reaction among the executives back at Philip Morris was n't embarrassment over what Campbell said , but anger over the way he and his fellow CEOs had been treated . <p> " This to me was very reminiscent of the bullying tactics of the McCarthy hearings , " says Merlo . " These are high-ranking officials of major corporations , they 're citizens of this country , they 're voters , they 're all of those things , and I just thought the treatment was totally inappropriate . It really enraged me . " <p> Freedom Fighters <p> The most senior executive to visit the conference room is Vic Han 's boss , Steven C. Parrish , vice president for corporate affairs . Parrish , 46 , is a trim , compact man with a baby face and wary blue eyes . Parrish , who grew up in Missouri , came to Philip Morris from Shook , Hardy &; Bacon , the Kansas City law firm that has long been the principal legal defender of the tobacco industry . <p> His years as a lawyer have taught Parrish the art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know if this is true but . . . " or " As I understand it . . . " . On this particular November morning , just a few weeks after President Clinton 's reelection , he speaks in terms of reconciliation and cooperation with anti-tobacco forces . <p> " We have a responsibility not just to say ' No , you 're wrong , ' or ' No , do n't do that , ' but to come up with some reasonable solutions , " says Parrish . " Because clearly tobacco is a significant public policy issue . " <p> Not every war is decided on the battlefield . After years of conflict , the battle over cigarettes seems to be moving slowly and hesitantly toward a settlement . Lawyers are meeting , legislators are quietly talking to lobbyists . The outlines remain vague , but a potential resolution would earmark billions of dollars annually for medical costs , along with federal legislation to further restrict advertising and access to children , and perhaps a commitment to reduce  --  and some day even eliminate  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be about who 's left standing at the end of the day , " Parrish says . " It should be about resolving problems and finding common ground . . . . It really should n't be about who wins and who loses . It ought to be about doing the right thing . " <p> And to see cigarettes as a matter of personal freedom , rather than a threat to public health , you have to get on the right side of the question of kids smoking . Ellen Merlo speaks for the Philip Morris people when she insists that the company markets only to smokers who are 21 and older . The company has no interest in enticing young people to smoke , she says , and is determined to help stamp out youth smoking by way of its Action Against Access program . It has stopped handing out free sample cigarettes to consumers and it no longer distributes tobacco products through the mail . It has placed " Underage sale prohibited " notices on all of its cigarette packs and cartons and has embarked on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his colleagues wo n't talk specifics about a settlement , but they do talk about dialogue , compromise and reconciliation . The company , Parrish says , is prepared for a legislative solution to the issue of youth smoking . " We 're not going to walk away and say . . . we do n't have to worry about the problem of youth smoking . We think something needs to be done . And we 're committed to working with whoever will work with us to try and make that happen . " <p> The company 's critics are not impressed . Gregory Connolly , an anti-smoking activist who heads the Massachusetts Tobacco Control Program , says most studies indicate Marlboro , the world 's best-selling brand , remains the most popular among underage smokers as well . He notes that the company continues to advertise in magazines popular with teenagers , such as Rolling Stone , Premiere and Sports Illustrated . " It 's really very hard for me to believe what the people at Philip Morris have to say on this issue , " says Connolly . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died of lung cancer , and in the nearly 10 years that he has been attending Philip Morris 's annual stockholders meetings , he has had chances to talk about the dangers of smoking with company executives . When they first come to the company , he says , they seem prepared to listen to his arguments . But after a while , a group identity and mentality begin to take over . <p> " There 's a level of denial , both personal and corporate , that is amazingly high , " he says . " It 's almost as if they 're brainwashed . They are isolated from society in general and Philip Morris becomes their universe . " <p> Late Bloomer <p> At the center of that universe there remains a seductive , even beguiling power . <p> Not long after he started working for Philip Morris , Steve Parrish , then 40 years old , highly educated , well-to-do , surprised himself by taking up smoking . Experts say almost no one starts smoking so late in life . So why did Parrish ? <p> It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new job , he says . In fact , he struggles to explain it . <p> " There are times when I like fiddling with the cigarette before I even light it . There are times when I like to see the smoke go up . I like the sensation at the back of my throat . Sort of all those things . <p> " I do n't know . I 've never really thought about it , I guess . "
