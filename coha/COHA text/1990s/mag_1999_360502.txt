If the hard-drugs crowd  --  Generation H  --  needed a bard , Clark would be the guy . His Kids was a glum screed about teens , drugs and unsafe sex . At least in Paradise , from a novel by ex-con Eddie Little , the lowlifes have some fun shooting up and stealing . Here two career criminals ( James Woods and Melanie Griffith ) adopt a young couple ( Vincent Kartheiser and Natasha Gregson Wagner ) into la dolce venom . There 's a droll tough love in this inversion of Father Knows Best , where Dad is given to arias of rage , Mom kills people , Bud and Princess do junk . The tone is naturalism run amuck : two-ton emoting , closeups of syringes in groins . Enough ! But it 's fun to see a scene stealer like Woods go bananas . Here he goes a bunch of them . <P>  --  By Richard Corliss
