<p> The first detailed information a mutual fund investor usually receives  --  and should read before investing  --  is the fund prospectus . While this is an important document , detailing everything from the investment objective of the fund to redeeming shares , the annual report may prove to be more interesting reading . <p> Most mutual funds send first quarter , semiannual , third quarter , and annual reports to shareholders . The semiannual report and annual reports are detailed , while the first and third quarter reports are often only brief summaries . The semiannual and annual reports cover the same areas in the same depth , so comments in this article apply equally to the semiannual report . <p> While the annual report covers a year 's time , the start and end of this year are based on the fund 's fiscal year , which may not correspond to the calendar year , making comparisons to market action and figures reported elsewhere more difficult . Be sure to know the period covered by any reports you are examining . <p> What 's in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but there is a consistent core of information . While not all annual reports will be equally complete , a detailed annual report will contain the information outlined here . ' Dear Investor ' <p> Many annual reports begin with a letter from the chairman , president , or portfolio manager of the fund summarizing the experience of the past year , perhaps even giving the specific return on the fund and the performances of some relevant benchmark indices . Surprisingly , some funds do not report any performance statistics at all . <p> What should you look for in this letter ? Check for significant shifts in investment strategy . In stock funds , for instance , look for moves into or out of a concentration in any industry ; in money market and bond funds , you may want to check on changes in maturity ranges ; in international funds , you would want to note any shifts in country weightings . <p> Also check to see if there have been any changes in the fund adviser or the portfolio manager . Look for anything that might cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> After the " Dear investor " letter , you will immediately confront a series of financial reports . The first you should read is the Statement of Operations ( Figure 1 ) . <p> Operations for a mutual fund consist of investment income and gains , and the costs incurred to produce them . Since all figures in this report are in total dollars rather than on a per share basis , spending much time with this statement would probably not be very productive . Of interest only in a very general sense is the laundry list of expenses that may give you a better feel for a fund 's operational management . These expenses are subtracted from investment income , dividends , and interest . <p> The resulting net income is further adjusted for gains or losses on investments . Here it gets a little tricky . First , net realized gains or losses ( see ( 1 ) in the chart ) on investments are reported . " Realized " simply means that the securities were sold , and " net " refers to the fact that gains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summary reported is the net change in unrealized gains or losses ( 2 ) on investments . Unrealized indicates that the investments are still held in the portfolio and " paper " gains and losses are netted together . Finally , both realized and unrealized gains or losses are added together to arrive at net gains or losses ( 3 ) on investments . This total , when added to net investment income ( 4 ) , is the bottom-line net increase or decrease in assets ( 5 ) from operations . Changes in Net Assets <p> The next financial statement combines the statement of operations with the fund 's experience with distributions to shareholders and redemption of fund shares . This is the statement of changes in net assets ( Figure 2 ) , and it reflects how much the total assets of the fund changed after investment operations and the flow of investors ' money into and out of the fund ; the bottom line is the total assets of the fund at fiscal year-end . Capital gains distributions reflect net realized gains ( 1 ) . Income distributions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fund realizes net gains and net income it basically makes distributions of these amounts . <p> What is important in this statement ? The total assets ( 3 ) of the fund can affect the flexibility , investment approach , and style of a portfolio manager . If the fund is a U.S. government bond fund or index fund , asset size is irrelevant , although larger funds may have smaller relative expenses since some fixed expenses can be spread over a larger asset base . Asset size becomes critical if it interferes with the portfolio manager 's investment objective . <p> For example , a fund specializing in small stocks that invests in thinly-traded , less-liquid stocks would find it difficult and costly to invest substantial amounts in certain issues . The result is that if this type of fund experiences a substantial growth in assets the objective of the fund may be redirected and the talent of the portfolio manager diluted . For a fund specializing in small stocks , $500 million in assets may be large and $1 billion absolutely unwieldy . On the other hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " companies may do reasonably well with $3 billion in assets . <p> It is also worth noting significant year-to-year changes in total assets . Large sums of new money may be difficult for a fund , particularly a specialized niche fund , to digest in the short-term , causing performance declines . Condensed Financial Information <p> The next financial statement is extremely useful  --  the condensed financial information ( Figure 3 ) , referred to as per share income and capital changes , and also as selected per share data and ratios . ( This statement is also found in the fund prospectus . ) <p> All items in this statement are either on a per share basis or expressed as a percentage of assets , facilitating an evaluation by individual investors . Bracketed figures show a reduction in net asset value . <p> Using the example , the $0.04 per share expenses ( 1 ) reduce net assets per share by that amount . The distributions of net investment income ( 2 ) and realized net gain ( 3 ) reduce net asset value per share . Since most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total assets are not as affected as the decline in net assets per share might indicate at first glance . <p> The distributions themselves are smaller than you might have anticipated looking at the net investment income ( 4 ) and net realized and unrealized gain ( loss ) on investment ( 5 ) figures . Why ? Two reasons . One is that , in this case , the fiscal year ends October 31 , while funds must pay out almost all net income and realized gains by the end of the calendar year , December 31 ; for this reason , the distributions may not match the net figures year-by-year , but over time they will match in total . <p> Second , a fund can distribute only a realized net gain ; if a gain is unrealized , there is nothing to distribute . Similarly , an unrealized loss can not be distributed . So , looking at that line in Figure 3 , the net realized and unrealized gain ( loss ) on investments of $3.55 in 1991 seems large relative to the $0.32 distribution . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gain . In 1990 , the $4.59 loss for this entry still allowed an $0.85 realized net gain distribution because even though the realized and unrealized total was a loss , there was a realized net gain . <p> The ratios at the bottom of the condensed financial statement provide a quick insight into the fund . The first is the expense ratio as a percentage of assets ( 6 ) . The higher this expense percentage , the lower your total return . Expenses include all those that were listed in the statement of operations , but it should be noted that front-end loads , back-end loads , redemption fees , other fees , and brokerage fees incurred by the fund in managing the portfolio are not included . Only the 12b-l fee , sometimes called a hidden load and referred to as a distribution expense , is included . <p> When examining these ratios , you may want to keep certain guidelines in mind . The average expense ratio for a stock fund is about 1.5% and for a bond fund it is closer to 1.0% . Funds with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some specialized funds such as international funds . High expenses are hard to overcome in general and even harder for less aggressive , lower risk , and lower return funds . <p> The ratio of net investment income to average net assets ( 7 ) is not a total return figure but rather an indication of the amount of income generated by the fund . The yardsticks for this ratio ? In the current market environment , aggressive growth funds would probably have net income ratios in the 0% to 1% range , growth funds in the 1% to 3% range , and growth and income funds in the 3% to 5% range . Bond funds , of course , would have much higher ratios , with longer portfolio maturity funds having the highest ratios . Watch out for funds that are out of sync  --  for instance , an aggressive growth fund with a net income ratio of 6% . <p> The portfolio turnover rate ( 8 ) is the lower of purchases or sales , excluding short-term money market investments , compared to average assets for the period . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100% with aggressive growth funds averaging higher and more income-oriented funds averaging lower . Again , look for funds where something is amiss  --  for instance , a growth and income fund with a portfolio turnover ratio near 300% . The Schedule of Investments <p> The schedule of investments is just that  --  a listing of all the stock and short-term fixed-income investments that the fund held at the end of its fiscal year . The schedule is broken down by asset class as a percentage of net assets . In the example , common stocks are 97.3% of net assets . Within an asset class , the holdings may be broken down further . If the asset class is common stock or corporate bonds , the holdings would be partitioned into industry groups , with each group rated as a percentage of net assets . Similar breakdowns would be found for substantial holdings of preferred stocks and convertible securities . These breakdowns are determined by the fund , and do not necessarily coincide , for instance , with the industry classifications determined by the federal government 's Standard Industrial Classification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dynamic portfolio at one point in time , it still can provide valuable insights into management approach and either confirm or deny that the investment objective is being followed . For example , the investment objective of the fund in Figure 4 is capital growth with no consideration of income production . The fund is classified as non-diversified  --  50% of its assets are required to be diversified while the remaining 50% can be concentrated . That means the fund will usually hold fewer stocks and concentrate holdings , as its name implies . If you opened the annual report one year and found that the fund held 200 different stocks , it would clearly be in conflict with its professed strategy . <p> The industries represented should also reflect the investment objective of the fund . Drug , environmental services , and technology stocks , all growth industries , make up a third of the portfolio . As would be expected with a fund in which income is not part of its objective , no utilities are in sight . While it is classified as non-diversified , it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not equal . It clearly is not a small capitalization fund ( one that invests primarily in small companies ) , since it has investments in such stocks as United Airlines , Philip Morris , Waste Management , and Wal-Mart Stores . <p> The point is not to analyze the portfolio stock-by-stock , but simply to understand the strategy and approach of the portfolio manager in comparison to stated investment objectives . <p> The notes to financial statements are probably worth skimming with an eye toward any special valuation of liquidity situation , such as securities with marketability that is limited in some way  --  limited partnerships and unregistered securities , for instance . <p> Finally , the report of the auditors should be clean , not qualified in any significant way . It should also attest to the fund having followed generally accepted accounting principles , with the statements fairly representing the financial position of the fund . <p> Always read and understand the prospectus before investing in a mutual fund . But set aside some time for the annual report , both before and after you have invested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the statements , do a quick evaluation of what the fund says it will do and what it actually does .
