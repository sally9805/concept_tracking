It was n't difficult . <p> " That 's nice . That 's nice . " <p> Anyone could have done it-absolutely anyone . <p> " Just the way I like you . Great . " <p> He 'd been applying the usual friction , first and second fingertips . " Mm . Now the right , " the circular rub and flicker insisting against cloth until both nipples caught at his attention , perked and ached . The way they would . <p> " Good . " His lips slackened , were licked moist , while his interest hid in the dumb black of his glasses . " Very good . " Laurie paused next , smiling , satisfied , happy my needs were symmetrically prominent . " Nice . " <p> But anybody with hands could have done as much . Not even hands , necessarily : hand would have been enough ; or a halfway decent prosthetic : even a properly placed domestic pet . Laurie was n't working miracles-he was not involved with raising up the dead-only a little prickle or two of extremely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , kiss and they 'll button up tight , they 'll crest . Within their particular limits , the more you choose to find them , then the more there 'll be to find-that 's how they work , their inclinations are naturally salient . I ca n't do a thing to change them and neither can he-not fundamentally . A simple chill can prick them , as can that certain monthly tenderness , and then I 'll be edged near precisely the same old slip of wet intentions he rubbed me to . <p> Traffic coughed and worried in the road beside us , pedestrians passed , among them a higher than average number of priests-or just men in cassocks , I 'm not an expert , I ca n't say-and I wanted , very simply , to pummel Laurie onto his back and in some way secure him , then cut him out naked at the waist and suck him until both his balls were small as raisins , until he cried . <p> Because such impulses are irresistibly instinctive , they ca n't be helped . Primed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or whom , I will react entirely predictably . Like the leopard with the zebra , like the lobster with the pot , I am part of Nature 's usual arithmetic . I do often try to remember this in order to build perspective , an independently distant view . <p> Four nuns pattered by , soundless , their faces a little unlikely , surprised to be marooned in wimples . My breath barked against my sternum , abrasively needy , while social convention and mental discipline struggled to keep me from arrest . I said nothing , did nothing , only seethed , as might have been expected , queasy with lust . <p> Laurie grinned , knowingly unscathed . " You like it just as much as I do , do n't you . Hm ? " <p> " But not now . " The day basted the avenue pleasantly : foreign monuments roiling under a classical sun and the Coliseum dark at Laurie 's shoulder , a monstrous hoop of decay . <p> " Why not now ? " <p> " Because people are looking , people will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worn that blouse-that 's why they 're looking , so of course they 'll see . Do n't you like men staring at your tits ? I do . Because they ca n't have you . Because you 're mine . " <p> Because you 're mine . It 's a standard wording , fits any mouth . I would have liked to turn it back on him , set my voice kicking in his chest , arcing that customary charge of hopefulness between the stomach and the throat . I would have liked to make it clear that : because you 're mine I will stand in the midst of clergy , stiff with the thought of your foreskin bitten back . Because you 're mine I will be-with insufficient warning-simultaneously furious , beguiled , delighted , affronted , murderous and cheap . Because you 're mine I will watch you the way that I 'm watching right now and remember that I can strip you full down to the pink , the quick . I know you at least as well as you know me . <p> Because you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dependent upon truth . <p> He 's pacing now , almost trotting , round the walls , being interested about foundations and seating arrangements and herringbone brickwork , as displayed in flights of steps . He has an enthusiasm for constructions that I find I can not share . But this is not a problem-I can sit here and write my letter while he prods about . And I can look at him moving through shudders of heat , the firmness of his shadow flexing , snug beneath him . He should wear a hat , really ; by this evening he 'll have burned . Laurie can be very cavalier about that kind of exposure . <p> I tend to be more careful because I have good skin . Most women of my age and younger have fine lines and visible wrinkles , but I do n't . I have elasticity and bloom . I catch myself sometimes in the mirror when I 'm alone and there it is-my beautiful outside-the ghosts of his hands still across it from the afternoons and evenings he 's spent examining , testing flexibilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , he does take the time to say . <p> I also give him my collaboration , my consent , my long bank-holiday weekend to pack up and use in a curtained and mirrored hotel room , in the moist , ecclesiastical heat of Rome . Since we flew in last night we 've transgressed without dispensation , hourly , perhaps because no one who matters is here to see . I could , for example , cross to him now , take his hand , stroke the blue push of veins at his wrist and wriggle our palms together in an unmistakably familiar , casual , mutually affectionate and incriminating way that any malign observer could use against us . But this is a safe city ; we have left Greenwich Mean Time and entered anonymity . <p> This makes Laurie happy , I can tell . His shoulders have a buoyancy about them I normally see only at night . In the dark he unfolds , relaxes , takes me outside , moves me up and down pavements we ca n't share with any kind of comfort in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I choose to come along , be where he takes me . <p> " Here ? " <p> " Why not ? " That time , we were in a field-lots of fresh air , healthy . " It 's quiet , there 's no one around . " But his eyes still flickered across the windows , checking . Although he enjoys observing , Laurie never wants to be observed . He has a fear of being cornered or forced into actions he wo n't wish to take . " No interruptions , hm ? " <p> I noted the bluey green of sheep 's eyes , reflecting far off to the right . " It 's raining . " " So you 'll get wet . <p> He put on the hand brake and he turned the engine off and we sat in his car in the overcast dark of the field . No stars . On other nights , he might have picked the forest , or the underground office car park . I removed my mackintosh , kept on my shoes . High heels-impractical on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctor ordered . Let me see , though . Let me really see . " <p> Because I wished to do so , needed to do so , had waited to do so , because this is a choice that I can make , I stepped out and crossed the turf to show him my skin . The bright burn of me flared in the headlamps , gleaming with drizzle and then moving , extinguishing under him . <p> " You 're a very naughty , dirty girl . " <p> Held safe between him and his car , I could feel his buttons against my spine , the thin chill of his zip , the tongue and groove of our mutual interest , of us being us together , our recoiling fit . I 'd turned my head and could watch the blisters of rain on the bonnet shiver and split ; a dim shining level with my eye . <p> He could have been anybody , " Lift your arse , " but he was Laurie , working me tight with a smooth negation of all other possibilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his cloth heat . My mother had often warned me against night air and stormy weather and being caught without a coat . Which made another reason to let Laurie catch me and-in a sense-lend me his . <p> " Good girl . " <p> Anticipation faded into mud , the vague scent of animal shit and wet wool . He pressed my breath into fits and starts and came , as always , silently in a ragged burst of motion and then stillness , withdrawal . He 's taught himself to be thoroughly secretive-which is why I 've learned to read his body and his things . This afternoon I can tell he is contented , easy : he does n't push at his hair too much , or tug his ears and there is something liquid in his stride , a muscular amusement , a tiny swing of appetite . <p> He 's dressed to be comfy , but not unattractive . I saw him , warm and freshly woken , maybe seven hours ago , picking the right things and strolling between the wardrobe and the bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , made the palms of my hands start to twitch . I am designed to experience these feelings , they are hardwired through my whole anatomy . I consider types of insulation , circuit breaking , but every time he trips the switch and seems to prove I could n't end this , that anything else would be inadequate . <p> Today , for example , he has equipped himself to show that he is happy and to jump-start my skull : white boxers ( the pair I bought him ) and his oldest jeans because we both know they hang well and make it look more than likely that he does , too . Add in the plain black T-shirt to set off the linen jacket for thumb-hooking over his shoulder and the Ray-Bans for making sure that he wo n't need to squint and there he is , my Laurie , all tooled up . <p> Back at home he 'll leave clothes with me : accessories , bits and bobs : small records of his scent and shape . Leather is most eloquent ; his belts roll where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mark the measure of his waist , his shoes and gloves reform against his movements and his sweat . And , of course , I do the same . In his absence , the pattern of his previous needs sings out on me . He 's oiled into the grain of my fingers the way any habit would be . It is unsurprising that , at night , I can find his memory shunts me into sleeplessness . <p> I have n't tried to sleep in Rome , not yet . It has seemed unnecessary . Fatigue occasionally dives at me , unsteadies reality , but I wo n't give in . I 'm going to stay more than conscious , because Laurie is all here with me : leaned over the railing , nicely taut and shifting : my encyclopedia . Before we leave , before it 's over , I 'll know his arms by heart , from the short clip of his fingernails to the paler and paler tenderness of his joints , the soft rise of hair . Anyone can concentrate , stay alert , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accompanied by the body they 've learned to miss . I am always greedy for what I know I 'll lack . <p> Of course , this rationing and waiting will tend to breed intensity in us both . <p> " Tell me where to aim it . " <p> The accumulated discomfort of over-rehearsed desire . <p> " Or I 'll just put it where I want . " <p> In Rome , I 'm moving from the grease of his imagination to his everyday coughs and whispers , his small breaths when he 's reading and the way he towels his hair . Each part of this is as addictive as I 'd guessed , as hard to walk away from , or to fight . <p> " I 'll put it where I want it . And you know where I 'll want . . . " <p> I 'm more used to the short nights when we 're trying to impress . They were when I pushed for something to stay with me while he did not , for marks , for brands in the memory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been anxious to experiment with error and trial : squatting , or standing , or bending or lying in my bath . <p> " That 's where I 'll want . Right there . And there . " <p> " Laurie . . . " The not unpleasant smell of it , almost herbal , slightly bitter , grassy , hot . " Laurie , could you- " <p> " What ? " <p> " Well . It is n't . . . erotic . " <p> He was standing unfastened , braced . " I 'm pissing on you , how can that not be erotic ? " He rubbed through his fringe with his free hand . <p> " It 's mainly just warm-more relaxing than anything . <p> I 'm sorry . " <p> " It 's not erotic . " His flow relented , sputtered , stopped . <p> " Not at all ? " <p> " I 'm sorry . " <p> He sat on the edge of the bath with his back to me , set his hands on his knees to lean forward and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " It was good to try . ' <p> " Yeah . " He looked at his watch . " I do n't really have time now for anything else . " <p> I hate Laurie 's watch . Resistant to many varieties of highly unnatural shock and proofed against pressures and waters at hideous depths , it will most certainly outlive us . It pecks out our time together unremittingly , it 's his conscience and my limit and I wish he 'd agreed just to leave it in our room . I do n't want to be reminded of when we 'll stop . I do n't want to be sad yet and have to tell him why . <p> I want to keep collecting and making his inventory complete without distractions . When I go home , he 'll have soaked my recollection , my blood will smell of him , I will think with his voice and be able to be alone , to be with other people and to comfortably keep in mind all I 'll need of him . <p> I do hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laurie could come to be anyone , the next one , someone new . <p> He 's craning over . He should n't do that , it leaves the skin between his hair and his collar bared to the sun . He 's tender there , sweet to kiss , and this is not what he does : something repeatable , replaceable , easy to find again . This is what he is . This is the unrepeatable , irreplaceable , unforgivable man I have had to do without for years , holding on , numb between installments of whatever his household arrangements allow him to give . This is the best he can bring me : it 's what should have stopped us becoming ridiculous . This should have prevented the evenings full of ice cubes and safety razors and fruit and all the other variations on our theme-a little bite of toothpaste , a little KY dip , escalating restraint . <p> " Dirty girl . " <p> " No , you 're the one that 's dirty . Dirty old man . " <p> He only grinned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , you 're the one and you 're going to prove it . Go and get that thing-I want to see . Show me how you 're a bad girl-playing while I 'm away . . . " <p> " The people at work bought it for me . " <p> " But you use it . " <p> " Yes , I do . " <p> I fetched it through for him , still in the box , so that he could unveil it . <p> " Fuck . " <p> My implement was longer , fatter-unmistakably larger than his . Which should have been of no significance to him . At least a couple of inches were just there for grip , they were n't a requirement , they did n't establish a level of need . He turned it in his hands like a condensed adultery . <p> " Fuck . " <p> But I do n't think he ever considered not using it . <p> " All right , then . All right . " The dark of his eye coolly mirroring my skin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , all right . " <p> And I do remember , absolutely clearly , the moment when the pain of his being there exceeded the pain of his having to leave me be . <p> Laurie and I , we do n't discuss that night , it 's a secret we keep from each other . We do n't tell . I find , more and more , that I write out what happened in letters I never post-letters to a wife I do not know . We must have a few things in common , though , that 's what I 'd suppose . We must both look at him , walking in sunlight , and find him beautiful . <p>
