SATURN IN THE SUMMER The best-known ringed planet , Saturn , comes to opposition on August 7 . That 's when Earth passes between Saturn and the Sun , causing the planet to appear opposite the Sun in our sky . On the night of opposition , Saturn rises at sunset and swings slowly across the sky until dawn . Though you need a telescope to see Saturn 's rings , the planet itself is easy to recognize as a steady point of golden light in the constellation Capricornus . Saturn is now at its closest to us for the year , about 825 million miles away . As a result , it also appears at its brightest for the year , magnitude 0.2 . Saturn takes nearly 30 years to complete one orbit around the Sun . It reached aphelion , or farthest point from the Sun , in 1988 . Now it 's drawing closer to the Sun ; its perihelion , or closest point , will come in 2003 . Thus the planet is several million miles closer to us this year than it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't quite as bright at this opposition as it was last year because its rings now appear less open as seen from our earthly vantage point . Thus the rings reflect less total sunlight in our direction and Saturn looks fainter . Be sure to look for Saturn and the Moon on the night of August 12/13 . The Moon is Full on the morning of the 13th . It 's no coincidence that a planet appears near the Full Moon around the time of its opposition . On the day that it becomes Full , the Moon is opposite the Sun . Saturn is also opposite the Sun now , and thus we see both of these worlds in the same direction in space . WILL THE PERSEIDS ROAR THIS YEAR ? This year 's Perseid meteor shower peaks on the night of August 11/12 . Unfortunately , the Full Moon arrives just a day later and interferes with meteor observing . But do n't give up on the Perseids altogether  --  there 's a chance that this year 's shower could produce a rare and spectacular storm . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shooting stars , " actually stem from debris left behind in the orbits of comets . The parent comet of the Perseids is Comet Swift-Tuttle , which was last observed in 1862 . Because this comet 's orbit around the Sun was thought to be 120 years long , people have been expecting it to return since the early 1980s , but no one has spotted it yet . Astronomers now suspect the true orbital period of Swift-Tuttle might be closer to 130 years and that the comet may reach perihelion this year . Great meteor storms sometimes accompany the return of a parent comet . Unusual activity accompanied last year 's Perseid meteor shower . Observers in Japan reported a rate of 350 meteors per hour for a brief time around the shower 's peak . Elsewhere on Earth , the observed rates were lower but still plenty respectable at about 100 meteors per hour . The 1991 Perseid burst seems to have lasted only an hour or two , but it 's possible that this short , strong surge of meteors might have stemmed from a mass of particles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have calculated when we will be passing again through the same part of the Perseid meteor stream that produced last year 's outburst . The answer is about 22h UT ( shortly before nightfall for us in North America ) on the evening of August 11 . The annual peak of the shower is scheduled for shortly after midnight that night . And do n't forget that most meteor showers are best observed before dawn , when the part of Earth you 're riding on has turned head-on into the meteor stream . A camp-out for the night of August 11/12 may be in order ! A PAIR OF EVENING PLANETS Late last month , the sky 's brightest planet , Venus , emerged from the twilight glare . This month , Venus slowly climbs higher into the western evening sky . Meanwhile , the second-brightest planet , Jupiter , is sinking lower every evening in this same part of the sky . These two worlds make a spectacular sight when they pass just 0.3deg from each other on the evening of August 22 . Start looking for the two planets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the Sun goes down . They make a pretty pair , but only because both shine so brilliantly . AUGUST 'S PLANETS Planets are visible throughout the night this August . The first one to pop into view after the Sun goes down is Venus . It lies low in the west after sunset . Each time night comes again , the planet lies minutely higher in the western twilight sky . It will take a while to creep high enough to become really prominent , but you can see it now if you make the effort to look . Venus shines brilliantly this month at magnitude - 3.9 . Look for it above and to the right of the fragile crescent Moon on the evening of August 29 . On that evening , binoculars might give you a last glimpse of Jupiter , below and to the right of Venus . Jupiter , in the constellation Leo , begins the month higher in the western twilight sky than Venus . While Venus ascends , however , Jupiter drops into the Sun 's glare . The two planets pass each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significantly fainter than Venus at magnitude - 1.7 . Two lesser lights seen so low in the sky would n't be visible . But you can enjoy seeing these two brilliant worlds against a background of bright evening twilight . The two are bright for different reasons . Venus shines brilliantly partly because it 's near Earth and partly because its surface is covered with highly reflective clouds . Jupiter is cloud-covered , too , but its brightness stems more from its enormous size . As August begins , you can find Saturn ascending in the southeast an hour after the Sun sets . On August 7 , the planet reaches opposition when Earth passes between it and the Sun . As a result of its nearness to Earth , Saturn shines most brightly for the year at magnitude 0.2 . It casts its gentle , golden light from among the background stars of the constellation Capricornus the Sea Goat , whose shape resembles an arrowhead . Mars rises just after midnight in August . It shines at magnitude 0.7 , slightly brighter than last month because Earth is edging closer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mars is always fun to watch as it makes its beeline around our sky , but it 's in a particularly good spot now in the constellation Taurus . This constellation contains two good asterisms , both of which are actual clusters of stars , the Pleiades and the Hyades . Mars begins the month in between these two . On August 11 , Mars passes 5deg north of Aldebaran , the brightest star in Taurus , which is located in front of the Hyades . Since Aldebaran is a reddish star , and Mars is the Red Planet , you 'll no doubt want to compare the colors and contrast the twinklings of these two lights in the sky . Innermost Mercury was visible early last month in the evening twilight sky . On August 2 , it swings between the Sun and Earth , emerging by mid-month into the morning twilight sky . Look for Mercury low in the east before sunrise beginning around mid-August . It shines brightly at magnitude 0.0 at greatest elongation on August 21 . Then the planet is 18deg west of the Sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sky , but its brightness continues to increase , reaching magnitude - 1.1 on August 31 . THE STARRY SKY The Summer Triangle is a large asterism made of three bright stars  --  Deneb , Vega , and Altair  --  from the constellations Cygnus , Lyra , and Aquila , respectively . There are plenty of triangles among the stars , but you can always recognize the Summer Triangle because it has another large asterism inside it , also a fairly large pattern , in the shape of a cross . This is the Northern Cross in the constellation Cygnus the Swan . In a dark sky , you 'll easily see that the Cross lies in the glittering band of the Milky Way . The Swan , which is the same asterism as the Cross , is equally easy to imagine ; this figure has been seen as a great flying bird by a variety of cultures . Be sure to scan with your binoculars all around Cygnus on a moonless night . You 'll be rewarded with myriad stars , star clusters , shimmering nebulae , and dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marks the tail of Cygnus the Swan and the head of the Northern Cross . Deneb is a fascinating star , an extremely luminous supergiant that is the most distant of all the bright stars . Its apparent magnitude is 1.3 , but it shines this brightly despite a distance of some 1,800 light-years . Near Deneb are the noticeable crossbar stars , with Gamma ( gamma ) Cygni in the center and Delta and Epsilon ( delta and epsilon ) Cygni at opposite ends . The 3rd-magnitude star Albireo , at the head of the Swan , marks the foot of the Cross . It 's a famous double star . Small telescopes show one component in the Albireo system as gold and the other as blue . And there 's more . Cygnus is jam-packed with fascinating objects and histories . For example , the star 61 Cygni  --  located at an estimated distance of only about 11 light-years  --  was the first star to have its distance measured . This feat was accomplished by Friedrich Bessel in 1838 . At the time , it was called " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witnessed . " Cygnus is also the site of history in the making . The two brightest ordinary novae in recent times have erupted within its boundaries . Many remember Nova Cygni 1975 , which reached 2nd magnitude . Last winter Nova Cygni 1992  --  the brightest nova since the one in 1975  --  reached a peak magnitude of about 4.3 and remained visible to the naked eye for about 10 days .
