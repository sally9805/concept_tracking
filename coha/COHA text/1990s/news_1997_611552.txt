<p> Following are excerpts of questions and answers at a news conference yesterday by President Clinton and Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto : <p> A Ruling on Tobacco <p> A court said that the FDA could not restrict tobacco advertising , which is the cornerstone of your crackdown against teenage smoking . Other than an appeal , is there any other recourse ; for example , regulating advertising through the FTC ? . . . <p> CLINTON : Well , first of all , this is on balance a great victory for the fight we have been waging for our children 's health because the fundamental legal issue was did the FDA have jurisdiction over tobacco companies . And they said yes . And since we believe strongly that for young people , access equals addiction , the fact that the ' yes ' includes the ability of the FDA to deal with access of young people to tobacco is a huge victory . And we started out against overwhelming odds of a very powerful interest group , that no administration had undertaken this before . And so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now the court also held , as you pointed out , that the statute which gave the FDA authority to regulate tobacco and regulate access , among other things , did not cover by its express terms advertising . So we will appeal that part of it . . . . We are very pleased by the court 's decision , especially coming , as it does , out of North Carolina , and we are determined to proceed on this course . We think it 's a great victory for us . . . . <p> U.S. Military in Okinawa <p> . . . When do you think a reduction of U.S. Marines stationed in Okinawa will become possible ? . . . Is it possible to relocate U.S. military drills from Okinawa to other parts of Japan maybe as a short-term measure to reduce the burden on the Okinawa people ? <p> HASHIMOTO : . . . We have no intention of asking for the reduction of these forces . In maintaining the stability and safety of the entire region , we very much cherish the present commitment that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we are causing burdens on the Okinawan people . . . . <p> CLINTON : . . . The United States is very aware that our presence , while it has enhanced the security of our country and Japan and the stability of the Asia Pacific region , has imposed burdens on the people of Okinawa . . . . We now have . . . a process underway which will lead to significant changes designed to reduce the burden on the people of Okinawa while permitting us to do what we need to do together to maintain stability in the region . . . . <p> China 's Hand in U.S. Politics <p> Prime Minister Hashimoto made the case for the United States and for Japan to maintain strong relations with China . But now there is apparently some evidence that the FBI has that top Chinese officials were trying to influence the U.S. political process . . . . Prime Minister Hashimoto . . . if you had evidence that China was trying to influence politics in Japan , would that affect your relationship with China ? And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the FBI briefed members of the Senate intelligence committee , that that information is being made available to you and to your senior national security advisers ? <p> HASHIMOTO : . . . If the Chinese government in fact does behave that way , and if the Japanese are pliable , then of course that end result will happen . But I do n't think that the Chinese leaders are attempting to do that with the Japanese politics , and we certainly have no intention of imposing our own views on the Chinese . . . . <p> CLINTON : . . . I believe that the president , the secretary of state , and the national security adviser should have access to whatever information is necessary to conduct the foreign policy and to protect the national interests of the country . <p> Secondly , especially in light of some of the allegations which have been made , I have made it clear that to resolve all questions , I expect every piece of information the Justice Department gives me to be shared with the Congress . I not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done . Now , that will be reassuring to everybody who 's covering other stories . And I think it 's important . <p> Now , in response to your question , I do not know the answer to that because I do n't know precisely what the briefing was . . . . If there was any improper attempt to influence or  --  the workings of the United States executive or legislative branches , obviously , that would be a matter of serious concern . But I think it is important that we not accuse people of something that we do n't know for sure that they have done , number one . . . . <p> Think about what you would define as ' improper ' influence . A lot of our friends in the world , countries with whom we are very closely allied , have friends in the United States that advocate for the policies of the governments all the time . It 's true  --  to take two obvious examples  --  it 's true of Israel , it 's true of Greece . And it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's publicly done . <p> There 's nothing secret or covert about it . We know that it 's done . It 's part of the political debate in America . And we do n't take offense at it . . . . But if there were some improper attempt to influence this government , would it affect our relations ? Of course , it 's something we 'd have to take seriously . But meanwhile , we have very large interests in a stable relationship with China and having China be a stable force in the Asian Pacific region , just as Japan does . And so I think it is important that we not assume something we do not know and act in a way that may not be warranted . We need to get the facts here before we do that . <p> The U.S. Budget Agreement <p> Some of your top advisers clearly think that next week is a crucial one in the budget talks . Some of them have suggested that it might be a make-or-break-it week as far as getting a balanced budget . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two , if so , why ? And number three , is there anything that you can hold onto concrete that says , ' Yes , we might get a balanced budget this year ' ? <p> CLINTON : . . . I was heartened by the process by which we reached agreement on the Chemical Weapons Treaty because it really was a process with a lot of integrity . It was very specific , very . . . problem-solving oriented . And it resulted , as you know , in getting a majority of both caucuses in the Senate to vote for the treaty . And that 's an indication of what we can do if we put the country first . <p> Secondly , as I have said before , we have had some days now of quite intense talks between the Republican and Democratic budget leaders of the Senate and House , and they have worked , I 'm convinced , with us in complete good faith . You know what the differences are ; they 're clear . We want a balanced budget that protects what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , including investing more in education , expanding coverage to children for health care , protecting the environment , cleaning up 500 toxic waste dumps , continuing to invest in technology , and things of that kind . They would favor more cuts in those programs and bigger tax cuts . We have differences between us . <p> Can we bridge the differences ? If we proceed just as we did with the Chemical Weapons Convention in the same sort of way , I 'm convinced we can . Do I favor an early agreement ? Yes , I do , if it 's a good one , and if it protects those things that I care about . Do I believe that there will be no balanced budget this year if the early agreements can not be realized ? No , I do n't believe that . I think it is so manifestly in the interest of the United States to do this . . . . <p> Peace in the Koreas <p> The peace in the Korean peninsula is vital to U.S. interests in Northeast Asia . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Korean peninsula ? <p> CLINTON : . . . We had hoped very much that the North Koreans would follow up on their agreement in principle to the four-party talks and actually come to New York and participate in the talks . <p> It was a big disappointment to me when they did not come , because I think it is clearly in their interest . And they , I think , are better off having agreed to freeze their nuclear program and getting an alternative source of energy . And I think they ought to go the next step now and resolve all their differences with South Korea in a way that will permit the rest of us not only to give food aid and emergency food aid because people are terribly hungry , but to work with them in restructuring their entire economy and helping to make it more functional again , and giving a brighter and better future to the people of North Korea . <p> So from my point of view , both because of the security problems inherent in the tension of the two armies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the capacity of North Korea to produce missiles and other kinds of mischief , and because there are a lot of people living in North Korea who are in distress now , I would very much like to see these talks resume . And the prime minister and I talked about it at some detail , and we know that our interests would be advantaged if the talks could be brought to a successful conclusion . <p> And I would urge the North Koreans to reconsider and to enter the talks as soon as possible . . . . <p> Memorializing FDR 's Disability <p> How strongly do you feel about having the new memorial to Franklin Roosevelt give prominent attention to his disability ? . . . <p> CLINTON : . . . I never thought about in those terms before ; I never thought about it as a legislative fight . . . . The genius of Roosevelt was that he had a flexible , imaginative mind that permitted us to preserve our fundamental values and principles and systems , under great assault . And he knew that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulty getting elected president if people had thought of him as a polio victim  --  or a ' cripple , ' to use the words that were prevalent in the early ' 30s , and so he went these enormous lengths to  --  to construct this deception . . . . Why ? Because he knew it was necessary at the time , because he knew he had the capacity to be president , and he did n't want some artificial perception to keep him from being president . <p> However , if he were alive today , my belief is . . . he would insist on being shown in his wheelchair because he would see all the progress we have made in the last 65 years on this issue , and he . . . would insist that we keep making progress . He would want this to be a living memorial , if you will , that would be part of America 's thrust into the future , not just a musing on the past . That 's what I believe . And I 've read a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him , instead of Hillary talking to Eleanor . . . . <p> I believe if he were here , he would say , ' Look at what we have done . Look at how we have changed attitudes toward disabilities . Look at all the doors we 're trying to open for people with disabilities . For God 's sake , tell everybody I did this , and I was disabled , so that all those disabled kids can know they can grow up to be president too , now . And they do n't have to hide it like I did . ' . . . <p> Food Aid for North Korea <p> On food aid to North Korea . . . you wish to maintain a very careful attitude , cautious attitude . I wonder how you explained Japan 's position to the president , and I wonder if the president understood Japan 's position . <p> HASHIMOTO : . . . We certainly are aware of the situation in North Korea that requires humanitarian food aid . At the same time , if we speak of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the North Koreans to do for us . And one of them relates to Japanese nationals  --  Japanese women who got married to North Koreans . And those people who went to North Korea have not been able to send letters to Japan , whereas North Koreans visiting Japan could always go , you know , back and forth between Japan and North Korea . These Japanese women who married North Koreans have not even been allowed to return to their families for temporary visits . So speaking of humanitarian issues , we would like the North Koreans to allow these Japanese wives to write letters back home or , you know , take temporary visits to their families in Japan . <p> And also , according to information that we have gleaned , there 's been several mysterious incidents that took place , one after another , in a rather limited time period , where some people . . . suddenly disappeared from Japanese shores . And North Korean spies , who later have confessed in South Korea . . . have said these people were abducted . So there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Japanese shore , were abducted by the North Koreans . . . . <p> CLINTON : Let me say I personally am very grateful for the prime minister 's support and for Japan 's support for the program to end the North Korean nuclear efforts , to freeze it and dismantle it , and for Japan 's generosity in so many areas around the world where Japan spends a higher percentage of its income than the United States on humanitarian efforts . We have devoted a significant amount of money , and have pledged more , to feed the people of North Korea . . . . <p> The world will find a way to keep the people of North Korea from starving and from dealing with malnutrition , but they need to lift the burden of a system that is failing them in food and other ways off their back , resolve their differences with the South . That will permit them the freedom to reconcile the problems they have still with Japan . . . . <p> Campaign Financing <p> You seem to be forgetting almost that China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advocacy in the American system in the American way , which is to say by hiring a high-powered lobbying firm here in Washington to do its advocacy work rather than possibly trying these back channels . And I also want to ask about campaign finance reform and that is how in the world do you expect to persuade very many of the people who were elected under the old system to ever give it up ? . . . <p> CLINTON : . . . I think that the only way I can persuade them to give it up is to believe if that . . . if they 're on equal terms with their opponents to have the confidence that since they 're already in if they 're serving well and doing a good job they should be able to persuade a majority of the people to reelect them and that I would never support any kind of campaign reform that did not at least guarantee some sort of equal footing to the competitors . . . . <p> This is a harder sell for the Republicans than the Democrats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're in the majority in Congress they can raise a lot more money . So let 's be fair to them , it 's harder for them to buy this than it is for us . But the one reason they ought to do it is that it takes too much of their time and it raises too many questions and it would  --  they would get more sleep at night , they would have more time to read , they would have more time to spend with their families , they would have more time to do the job of being in Congress . <p> They could also spend time with people they know who have money and influence and not be asked if they were spending it for the wrong reasons , and they could actually solicit people 's opinion without somebody worrying about whether they had actually purchased a congressman 's vote on something . . . . <p> Regarding your first question : I do not know the facts . That 's the only thing I 'm saying . I just do n't want to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know the facts . . . . <p> The Value of a Dollar <p> . . . Do you want a weaker dollar , to help cut or to help prevent U.S. trade deficit with Japan from increasing significantly ? <p> CLINTON : You have asked an excellent question and one to which I must give a careful answer ; otherwise , I will affect the value of the dollar , which I do n't want to do . Here is our position : We do not want a weak dollar simply to improve our trade position . . . . We want our dollar to be healthy and strong because we have a good strong economy and good economic policies . But neither do we want any other actions to have the effect of throwing the exchange rate system out of whack in order to gain undue advantage in international trade . <p> So what we would like to see . . . are good , coordinated , balanced economic policies among all the strong economies of the world . And a commitment among all of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other countries a chance to grow wealthier on responsible terms . . . . <p> Race Relations <p> Your aides have said that in coming weeks you plan to announce a major initiative on the state of race relations in this country . Why now ? And what do you expect a blue-ribbon panel , commission , or task force  --  whatever you decide  --  to produce in terms of tangible results that will make a difference in people 's lives ? <p> CLINTON : . . . I have not yet settled on a final form of an initiative . But what I . . . think we need to do is to examine the nature of our relations with one another as Americans and what America is going to be like in this new century . I think it is time for a taking stock . <p> We 've been through some huge upheavals over race in America . We fought a civil war over slavery and race . And then we had a series of constitutional amendments that gave basic citizenship rights to African Americans . Then we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steady , explicit forbidding of various kinds of discrimination . And then we had the Kerner Commission Report in ' 68 , which basically said even if you eliminate all these negative things there are certain affirmative things you have to do to get people back to the starting line so they can contribute to our society . And then we had 25 years of affirmative action , which is being rethought now , reassessed and argued all over again . <p> But America has changed a great deal during that time . The fastest growing minority group now are the Hispanics . There are four school districts in this country , including one right across the river here in Virginia , that have children from more than 100 different racial and ethnic groups in one single school district . And I personally rejoice at this . I think this is a huge asset for the United States as we go into the 21st century , if we learn how to avoid the racial and ethnic and religious pitfalls that have  --  that are bedeviling the rest of the world today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I want to take stock , see where we are , and see how we can get into the 21st century as one America , respecting our diversity but coming closer together . . . .
