<p> Move over , Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna . Your lesser-known neighbors are vying for their own place in the limelight . <p> Apparently it takes more than " Italy " in the title to get readers ' ( or maybe publishers ' ) interest these days , so new Italian cookbooks have gone regional . This year it 's Calabria and Puglia , Piedmont and Liguria  --  especially Liguria  --  in a dizzying assortment of books . <p> But before you rush off to the bookstore , be aware of what these books are about . The new offerings tend to chickpeas and stockfish and zucca and specialties that could be likened to the chicken-feet concoctions written only in Chinese on local menus . Which is to say that it 's nice to know they exist , and perhaps even why the locals favor them , but you wo n't necessarily want to try them at home . <p> On the other hand , if your grandmother came here from Brindisi or Locri or Genoa , you may find a much-beloved family favorite in one of the volumes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rossetto Kasper 's enormously successful " The Splendid Table "  --  a bit of history , recipes gleaned from home cooks and restaurants of the region , sprinkled with the century-old observations of literary figures . <p> All play on the fact that Italy was united politically relatively recently ( 1870 ) and all seek to highlight the culinary bounty of their particular region , even when the bounty is scanty . <p> The scant bounty is the thesis of Fred Plotkin 's Recipes From Paradise ( Little , Brown , $ 32.50 ) , the most comprehensive of three new books focusing on Liguria , better known as the Italian Riviera . With few exceptions  --  Portofino , San Remo , Genoa and the Cinque Terre  --  the cities and towns along the coastal arc at the top of the boot are hardly household names . <p> Sure , Christopher Columbus hailed from Genoa and pesto has invaded every hamlet in America , but what else can you say about the place ? <p> If you are Plotkin , a lot . <p> He meticulously traces the ancestry of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( farmers ) who eked out a living on the craggy hillsides that rise above the sea . He documents how ham and cheese from Parma made their way into the local cooking ( salt from Liguria was essential to producing both ) . He makes clear that life on land and sea was a hardscrabble existence . <p> Like many peasant cuisines , the Ligurian diet 's staples could be considered scavenge there : chickpea flour and chestnuts , fresh anchovies , cardoons and porcini mushrooms . But in an American kitchen they are luxury items . Others are not available here at all . <p> Except for pesto  --  and Plotkin documents at least 18 variations , none of which is the Marcella Hazan version  --  these are unfamiliar foods . And the ones that are familiar  --  marinated fresh anchovies , fish baked in salt , spinach with raisins and pine nuts  --  are common to most of the northern Mediterranean coast . <p> Two regional standouts are farinata ( chickpea tart ) , which is similar to the socca ( chickpea crepe ) of Nice , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plotkin says even most Ligurians are n't familiar . The tart , or crepe , requires a 12-inch round pan and an oven of 650 degrees , and there is only one artisan who still makes the traditional stamps . <p> Plotkin 's book is scholarly , exhaustive , historically important . It also has the most irritating index in the smallest type of any cookbook I have ever seen . <p> Colman Andrews takes a more catholic approach to the Riviera , including foods from both France and Italy , showing how the foods of one are often simply variations on those of the other . <p> Everything about Andrews 's book , Flavors of the Riviera ( Bantam Books , $ 24.95 ) is more approachable , from the typography to the recipes . Andrews explores not only the relationship between socca and farinata and French and Italian ravioli , but documents the kinship of salade nicoise and cappon magro , an elaborate arrangement of fish and vegetables that is the crown jewel of the Ligurian repertory . <p> Andrews explains rather than lectures . The inclusion of coastal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are more inviting and make me want to cook from this book . <p> The third entry in the Riviera sweepstakes is Enchanted Liguria by David Downie ( Rizzoli , $ 40 ) . More of a coffee-table lifestyle book that happens to include a few recipes , this volume is filled with dreamy photographs of majestic churches and luxurious interiors that portray the entire region as a Portofino fairy tale . <p> The recipes , which make up only about 30 pages , are clearly the most attractive and palatable examples of Ligurian cuisine , and are decidedly upscale . This is a good book if you plan on traveling to the region , but offers little substance about the breadth of the food there . <p> By contrast , the Italian Piedmont , just inland from Liguria , seems to justify the title of wine writer Matt Kramer 's A Passion for Piedmont  --  Italy 's Most Glorious Regional Table ( William Morrow , $ 29 ) . <p> This is the land of white truffles ( which dry weather has sent to more than $ 700 per pound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as tajarin , risotto , braised meats , game , freshwater fish and rich desserts . <p> There are no lectures here , just mouth-watering recipes with pithy introductions about their origins and ties to other regions . The instructions are clear , and modern appliances are incorporated into them . <p> Kramer spent a whole year in Piedmont working on his book , but it 's the earthy foods of fall and winter that predominate . <p> Similarly , Nancy Harmon Jenkins lived in Puglia for more than six months researching hers , Flavors of Puglia ( Broadway Books , $ 25 ) , but it is more evocative of the seasons and particularly the various festival days that in Italy still unite the local populace . <p> Puglia , the heel of Italy 's boot , has a varied cuisine that includes the sun-flavored tomatoes and vegetables of the south , the briny fish and shellfish of the sea and rabbits and calf 's liver and lamb . <p> This is familiar food , often with a twist , but nonetheless similar to Italian dishes you have cooked or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar to a pasta-and-greens dish that has roots in Istria , the former Venetian outpost . But the Pu- gliese version , which Jenkins lists as one of three dishes most prepared in the region , adds red hot chili peppers and anchovy fillets to the bitter greens instead of the sometimes cloying sausage in the Istrian version . <p> For the most part , these are clean , uncomplicated dishes that accent the flavors of the ingredients rather than mask them , the hallmark of Italian cooking . And there 's an interesting section on canning and preserving . <p> Mary Amabile Palmer 's volume focusing on the food of Italy 's toe , Cucina di Calabria ( Faber and Faber , $ 29.95 ) , was written as a way of preserving the favorite recipes of the immigrants , including Palmer 's parents , who came to America from Southern Italy . She collected the recipes from them , and during visits to Calabria . <p> Family treasures they may be , but many of these recipes originated elsewhere in Italy and represent the homogenization of Italian cuisine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included in this volume , along with unusual preparations , including ones for fresh tuna and swordfish , that doubtless are Calabrian . It does n't make the food less inviting , but the renditions are not so purely regional as those of the other volumes . <p> If you prefer a more sweeping collection of recipes from across Italy , there are two new volumes to consider , Michele Scicolone 's A Fresh Taste of Italy ( Broadway Books , $ 30 ) and Marlene de Blasi 's Regional Foods of Northern Italy ( Prima Publishing , $ 26.95 ) . Both strive to introduce the taste of regional recipes , based on American products . <p> The most basic ingredients vary widely between the two countries . The all-purpose flour in Italy is most likely to be softer ( Americans often combine softer pastry flour with all-purpose flour to devise something as soft ) , Italian eggs are smaller , and the yolks have a deep golden color that I have never seen in this country . Artichokes are different varieties , the same species of fish taste different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Recognizing these differences , Scicolone and de Blasi strive to manipulate the ingredients available to American cooks to create the same tastes as Italian recipes . <p> Both provide summaries of the trademark dishes of each of Italy 's regions and then give recipes for many of them . Neither maintains the culinary purity of Plotkin . But these are the books you 'll be most likely to cook the most from . <p> PALLINE DI CARNE CON LE MELE IN BRODO <p> ( Little ' Marbles ' in Broth ) <p> ( 6 servings ) <p> The " marbles " in this soup can be made of chopped veal or turkey . The soup can be prepared well ahead of time , but do not add the " marbles " to the soup until just before serving , or they will get soggy . The meat mixture will keep its flavor for up to 24 hours , refrigerated.  --  From " A Passion for Piedmont " by Matt Kramer ( William Morrow , $ 28 ) . <p> 1/2 pound ground veal ( or turkey ) <p> 1 tart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cored and grated or finely chopped <p> 1/4 cup milk <p> 1 large egg <p> 1 garlic clove , finely chopped <p> 1 1/2 ounces grated Parmigiano- Reggiano cheese ( about 6 tablespoons ) , plus extra for serving <p> Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste <p> 1 tablespoon unsalted butter <p> 1/2 cup dry white wine <p> 8 cups chicken or beef stock <p> In a large bowl , combine the veal , apple , milk , egg , garlic and cheese , and season with salt and pepper to taste .

In the slang of Genoa , a porpetton ( polpettone in dialect ) is anything boring . It makes sense : This is kitchen-table fare  --  as undemandingly reassuring to a Genoese as mashed potatoes and gravy might be to us.  --  From " Flavors of the Riviera " by Colman Andrews ( Bantam Books , $ 24.95 ) . <p> 2 pounds green beans , trimmed <p> Salt <p> 1/2 onion , finely chopped <p> 1 garlic clove , minced <p> Extra-virgin olive oil <p> 4 flat-leaf parsley sprigs , finely chopped <p> Leaves from 3 or 4 sprigs marjoram or oregano <p> 3 ounces ( about 3/4 cup ) Parmigiano- Reggiano cheese , grated <p> 4 large eggs , lightly beaten <p> 3 ounces ricotta cheese* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Preheat the oven to 300 degrees . <p> Cook the beans for 10 to 12 minutes in a pot of boiling salted water .
