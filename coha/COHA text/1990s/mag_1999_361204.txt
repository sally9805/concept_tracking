Why sit through just one mediocre movie when Life offers an anthology of them ? First it 's Harlem Nights : Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence meet in a Manhattan speak-easy in 1932 . Then it 's a period prison picture , as the stars get framed on a murder rap . Climax in the ' 70s with an all-male Driving Miss Daisy , and keep on meandering into the ' 90s as the codgers plan one last adventure . Since the characters are in stir most of the time , the film does n't move ; it just ages . Murphy 's real co-star here , as in Coming to America and The Nutty Professor , is makeup maven Rick Baker . The facial prostheses are funny and poignant . Unlike this life-long film . <P>  --  By Richard Corliss
