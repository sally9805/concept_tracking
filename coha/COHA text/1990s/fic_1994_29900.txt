Son of Fletch By Gregory Mcdonald Random House Gregory Mcdonald 1 Mister Fletcher ? In the hard rain , Fletch had stopped the jeep at the roadblock on the narrow county road . It was raining so hard he and Carrie had almost failed to see the sputtering warning flares as they came down the twisting , rockwalled road through the gap . When the Jeep was stopped in front of the two county police cars parked as a wedge facing them , their headlights lit , a great bulk of a man wearing a yellow slicker , dark , wide-brimmed hat lumbered toward them . He was lit by the Jeep 's headlights but more backlit by the high beams of the police cars . " Ha ! " Carrie had said . ' Fletch , I told you not to leave your popcorn bucket on the floor of the movie theater ! They 're out lookin ' for you , now they 've cotched you , and they 'll put you under the jailhouse for sure . " " Who is that ? " Fletch asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeep made them speak loudly . " Rondy , " Carrie answered . " You know him . His uncle is Biggie Wilson . You been huntin ' with him , that time you all treed the Carter boy ' cause he has the natural smell of possum . Fletch opened the Jeep 's door , as that was easier than unzippering the window . " Hiya , Rondy . How 's your Uncle Big Stuff ? " " He 's just fine , Mister Fletcher . " Rondy flashed his light around the interior of the Jeep . He leaned to look directly behind their seats . " Evenin ' , Carrie . You folks doin ' all right ? " Carrie said , " Happier than worms wrigglin ' in warm mud . " Rain was pouring off the brim of the deputy 's hat . " Plenty of warm mud around . " " What 's happening , Rondy ? " Carrie leaned forward in the passenger seat and spoke across Fletch . " The sheriff misplace his spectacles again ? " " Some villains decided to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kentucky , Carrie . " " Ca n't blame ' em , " Fletch said . " We 've been advertising Tennessee as a vacation spot . Take yourselves off to Tennessee . Is n't that the slogan ? " " We 've been told to welcome tourists all right , Mister Fletcher . It 's just that we 're concerned these particular fellows , being wards of the government , a federal responsibility , might stay out so late they just might miss their breakfasts . " " Ca n't let that happen . " " No , sir . They left home without any pocket money , is what has us worried . " Fletch smiled . " Armed and dangerous ? " " We do n't know if they 're armed yet . If not , they sure will be soon enough . Dangerous for sure . " Also dressed in yellow slickers , wide-brimmed hat , black rubber boots , carrying a flashlight , Sheriff Rogers came up and joined Deputy Wilson at the Jeep 's door . The jeans on Fletch 's left leg were getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Howdy , Sheriff , " Carrie said . " Do n't Francie let you take a shower-bath at home anymore ? " " Says I keep leavin ' wet towels on the bathroom floor . So she sends me out every time there 's a hard rain . She 's been complainin ' about wet towels on the floor thirty-two years now . " The sheriff grinned . " Funny how some women never change . " " Nor should we , " sniffed Carrie . " How long since you all been gone from the farm ? " " Few hours , " Fletch answered . " Went to St. Ives , had supper , saw a movie . Left home about what , five-fifteen ? " " You got guns at home , Mister Fletcher ? " " Sure . " " Anywhere an intruder could find them ? " " Sure . " " Loaded ? " " No . The shells and cartridges are kept separate . " " That 's good . Maybe we should send Rondy here home with you . " Rondy frowned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We 'll be all right . How many villains are you lookin ' for tonight ? " " Four . " The sheriff fished a wet piece of paper out of his pocket and held his flashlight on it under the Jeep 's roof . " One murderer , one attempted murderer , one kidnapper , and one serving heavy time on drug charges . " " Shoot , " Fletch said . " I thought Rondy said these were bad dudes . You have their names there ? " Rainwater ran down the sheriffs face despite his widebrimmed hat . " Kriegel , Faoni , Leary , and Moreno . " The sheriff accented the first syllable of the last name . Putting the paper hack into his pocket , he said , " Ca n't figure why they 're coming through here . " " Headed south , I suppose , " Fletch said . " Alabama border . Lose themselves in Florida . " " Except they 've drifted sideways , " the sheriff said . " This is n't a direct route to anywhere for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you know they 're here ? " " Told they were comm ' this way , for sure . Then Ms. Mobley spotted them running along the ridge just before sunset . The sheriff waved toward the west . " Guess we can believe her , all right . " In her sixties , Mary Ann Mobley was considered the sharpest-eyed hunter in the county . " Could n't get to ' em , of course , in all this dampness . " The sheriff craned to look at the Jeep 's shifts . " This a four-wheel drive , Fletch ? " " Yes , sir . " " Mind if we borrow your Jeep , Fletch ? We 'll start by patrolling your farm . " " Not at all . You 're welcome to it . " " Trouble is , I really need Rondall here . There are just the two of us , two cars . Maybe I 'll radio in and have a couple of deputies stop by your farm on their way out from town . They can pick up your Jeep , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That will be fine . " " Got gas ? " " Filled up in St. Ives . " " We 'll appreciate it . " " So will I. " Fletch put the Jeep in first gear . " Be real careful going into your place . Unless they 're traveling faster than they have been , there 's a large chance they 're down there somewhere near or on your farm . Sorry I ca n't spare Rondy to go with you . " " We 'll be fine . Not to worry . " Fletch closed the Jeep 's door . Slowly he drove between the blinding headlights of the police cars . Already Carrie was picking her fingers . " Well , I 'm worried . A little bit . " " About what ? " Fletch asked . Carrie looked toward her rain-streaked plastic window . " Four villains peekin ' out of the bushes at us . " Fletch said , " Around here we 've got coyotes , wolves , bobcats , panthers , and snakes . " " And a bear . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one dark night . She had n't lingered to collect evidence it really was a bear . " You 're not all that afraid of snakes , bobcats , and bears , are you ? " " Animals make sense , Fletch , " Carrie said . " It 's the humans you ca n't trust worth a patootie . " " Should I stay here ? " " Absolutely not . " Using the four-wheel drive , Fletch had driven up the old dirt timber road at the back of the farm . Lights out , he drove along the top of the hill behind the farmhouse . He stopped just inside the edge of the woods . " These dudes want the Jeep . And they want you . I 'd rather you stay with me . " " You do n't care as much about the Jeep ? " " Not as much . I 'm going to let the counties use it , are n't I ? " A few months before , two of the county 's cars had smashed into each other , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the hill just inside the line of trees . Even though they were slipping and sliding on the wet hillside , Carrie took his hand . " Maybe the bobcats will get ' em , " she said . " Maybe that panther you saw the other night will tear ' em apart like lettuce leaves . " " If you do n't hush , " Fletch said , " we might as well be driving up the driveway honking the horn and going in the side door singing ' Three Coynes in a Barroom . ' " " First time I 've thought kindly of rattlesnakes , " Carrie said . When they got just above the house , Fletch said , ' You might stay here now . Give me time to case the joint . " " Here ? This is about the place we saw the black wolf go into the woods last fall . " " You think he 's still here ? " " Might could be . " " There 's plenty for a wolf to eat out here without taking a snack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variety who think food only grows in refrigerators we need to worry about right now . " " I do n't have a gun , Carrie said . " What do I do if the wolf comes by ? " " What you charmin ' Tennesseans always do . " " What 's that ? " " Say , ' Hydy , Mister Wolf . How 's your pa ? ' " " Which paw will I be askin ' about in this case ? Right , left , front , back ? " " If you hush your mouth , at least the humans wo n't know you 're here . " He climbed over the white board fence . Crouching , he circumnavigated the house . He peered through the windows into every room on the first floor . Throughout the house there were baseboard safety lights . Behind the house , he opened the door to the smokehouse . In the dark , rain pounding on the aluminum roof , he found the pipe end , about six inches long , an inch wide , he had left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . He placed the white PVC pipe on the walk leading from the side of the house to the barns , just outside the study . It would be visible on the path once the lights in the study were lit . Then he entered the house through the back door , went from room to room and upstairs turning on lights . He took the handgun from his bathroom closet and loaded it . There was no sensible place to carry it in his sopping shirt and jeans , so he kept it in his right hand . Openly he went back across the backyard in the rain . " Okay , " he quietly said over the fence . " You can come out now . All yee , all yee , home be . " " I 'm not here . " " Oh ? " He could not see her in the dark woods . " A panther carried me off by the foot , all you care . " Wet blond hair streaming down her face , she climbed over the fence . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has n't been touched . " " Long as they leave my pickled beets alone . " In the kitchen , Carrie said , " Me for a shower . A warm shower . You too ? " " Guess I 'll wait until you 're finished . " " Will you come upstairs with me ? " " There are no panthers upstairs . I already looked . " He got a can of tuna fish out of the cupboard . She asked , " You hungry ? " " No . Come to think of it , let me go upstairs for the shotgun . Then I 'd like you to go into the living room , turn out the lights , and wait for me . " " Oh . " Wet and cold , she shivered . " The Jeep . " Leaving Carrie standing alone with the loaded shotgun in a corner of the dark living room , Fletch jogged up the slippery hill . There was no question whatsoever in his mind that if she were confronted with an intruder , Carrie would not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did , which was very well indeed . Without a blink of hesitation , if armed , calmly she would blow the head off anyone who messed with her , or hers . In his years in the southern part of the United States , Fletch had come to know and respect the Southern country woman considerably in this way . Distinctly Carrie was a Southern country woman . Thinking it would be safer , Fletch drove the Jeep back along the timber road , down to the hardtop road , down it to the driveway , and up it . He left the Jeep in the carport , with the truck and the station wagon . In the dining room , he said into the dark living room , " If you do n't shoot me , just maybe I 'll live to give you a kiss . " " What will you give me if I do shoot you ? " " The job of having to dig a big hole somewhere . " " Are you alone ? " The intelligence of the question impressed him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joke . " " I 'm alone , " Fletch said . " Prove it . " " All escaped convicts are chickens . " " Okay . " In the bedroom , staying nearer to the door to the house than to the bathroom door , so he could hear over the sound of the shower , Fletch pulled off his boots and his wet clothes . He put on his bathrobe . " All done . " Carrie came out of the bathroom with a towel wrapped around her head . " Are you going to use the hair dryer ? " " I have to . " " I 'll wait . " When she was done , he left her in the bedroom with the handgun and took a quick , warm shower himself . " Okay . " He put the shotgun on the floor next to Carrie 's side of the bed , away from the bedroom door . " Is this good for you ? " " Fine . " He changed into fresh jeans , shirt , and running shoes . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit up all night ? " " Maybe . " In the kitchen , he picked up the phone and listened . He tried a few numbers . The phone was dead . He mixed the tuna fish with chopped onion , celery , and mayonnaise . He lightly toasted two pieces of bread . He put the light toast on a plate , heaped the tuna mix on the toast , and spread Swiss cheese on the tuna . He put the plate into the oven . He did not turn on the oven . Then he went into the study . He opened the French door behind his desk . With his back to the door , he sat at his desk , apparently relaxed . He slid the handgun under some loose papers on his desk . Outside , the storm raged . The rain was deafening . The wind moved a paper on his desk . After the warm day , the breeze cooled off the study quickly . Fletch did not have long to wait . It was only a few minutes when he felt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A voice behind him said , " Do n't move . Fletch said , " Hydy , son . How 's your ma ? " 2 Careful not to move , Fletch said , " Son , put down that PVC ! " He chuckled . Behind him , a young man 's voice asked , " What 's a PVC ? " " In this instance , " Fletch answered , " I mean that piece of white , plastic pipe , six inches long , one inch in diameter you 're holding in your left hand . " Fletch continued to feel the pressure against his head , behind , below his left ear . Continues ...
