Remember when Miss Grohny made you dissect that earthworm in Biology I ? You thought that you were learning about reproductive organs or nervous systems or something like that . Now that you 're older , you can be told : The title on Miss Grohny 's lesson plan that day was , " Show the little nippers that science ai n't always pretty . " Which is my way of warning you that this column is not for the faint of heart . Some of my friends tell me that they occasionally receive brown envelopes in the mail , inside of which are more envelopes inside of envelopes , carrying warnings that if you do n't want to read what 's inside , then you should stop opening envelopes . Well , sometimes science is like that too , so here it is  --  WARNING : Enclosed are explicit science materials meant for adult eyes only ! Not long ago , a fellow scientist passed along to me a fascinating news item ( FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE ! ! ) from the American Anthropological Association . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know that the AAA sent out press releases . But you can be sure I 'm going to pay a lot more attention from now on . The tantalizing item summarizes a research project conducted at the Institute of Human Origins . As usual , the heavy-duty science is preceded by a lot of stuff we already know  --  men snore more than women ; people in general snore mostly while they are sleeping . Then comes the good part  --  the science part . Male snoring , it is speculated , is not random noise but a clever defense system : " For our early human ancestors sleep proved to be one of the most vulnerable times of the day . By mimicking the sound of their most common predators , carnivorous cats and hyenas , early humans could broadcast throughout the night , " We are carnivores , we are many , we are strong , and we are healthy ! ' ' " Boy , are they off base . My wife , Lovely Linda , assures me that my snoring says something , all right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am dead to the world ! I sure could use some work on my adenoids ! I should n't have had that second helping of garlic bread ! " ( While not disputing this interpretation , a supportive acquaintance  --  male , married  --  defended my snoring 's survival functions . His theory : Men snore so women will stay awake and keep watch . ) At any rate , the trouble with anthropologists is that they like to think of themselves as scientists , but all too often they forget to apply the Scientific Method to their investigations and thus reach premature conclusions . Good thing I 'm here to straighten them out . First , let 's look at the biology of the matter . Linda tells me I snore , and it may be true , for sometimes I actually wake myself up with my own snoring , as physically impossible as that may seem . It probably is hereditary : my father says he sometimes snores so loudly he has to get up and move to the other bedroom to get some sleep . Anyway , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the physiological devices necessary for snoring , and that I do snore . Does that mean one needs equipment like mine  --  a nose half the size of the rest of my head  --  to snore ? Not at all . Lovely Linda has a little bitty nose . It 's a beautiful nose , in part because it is little . While she is exceedingly sensitive about the issue , and I would appreciate it if you would keep this under your hat , she does snore . Vigorously . With grace notes and glissandos . That she is a woman and has a little nose has nothing to do with her ability to fill the night with sound . My black Lab , Spot , has a nose the shape and size of Delaware . When he snores , he loosens shingles on our house . And the neighbors ' houses . Hey , wait a minute ! Is n't he one of those carnivores my snoring is supposed to threaten ? Well , it does n't . In fact , Spot could n't care less about my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to men or , for that matter , human beings . I took my scientific musings up to Slick 's Tavern last night to bounce them off the heads ( not as much a metaphor as you might imagine ) of my buddies . They concur with my position and dismiss the theories expressed in the news release as pure piffle . With that confirmation I could have gone home and snored away the night , but Slick tossed a scholarly hand grenade onto the seminar table , and this is where things got scientifically untidy . ( Remember Miss Grohny 's earthworm ! ) I will do what I can to handle this matter with sensitivity . Slick said , " Well , yeah , but what about some other bodily sounds , like ... er ... uh ... flatulence ? " Whoa ! We ordered another round of beers and pickled hard-boiled eggs and allowed our mental and gastral gears to grind away at a problem far more complex than I or , I suspect , the Institute of Human Origins ever anticipated . Woodrow noted that dogs do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't ... well , you know . But , he conceded , canines are famous for SBDs ( silent but deadly ) . Slick then brought the discussion back on course : " My friends , here we are talking audio , not nosio . " Lunchbox then threw the debate into chaos with his observation , " And women do have the equipment but never you-know-what , ever . " Slick tried to break Lunchbox 's thesis  --  " Little girls do , " but Lunchbox beat back the challenge . " Vestigially , perhaps , but the capability is lost when the female child approaches maturity . And then there 's belching . Dogs never belch . " And if ever there was an expert on belching , it was Lunchbox . I thought I had been around when I was in college and had a fraternity brother who could belch on demand . That modest talent was blown away , so to speak , the first time I heard Lunchbox belch " Budweiser , " just as clear as could be . If there was any question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressed my admiration , whereupon he downed the contents of his glass and belched , " Old Milwaukee ... Lite .... " I gasped . " In recyclable aluminum cans .... " I staggered . " On ice . " I ' ' 11 never forget it . So , while the case for snoring was blurry at best , some biological functions at either end of the alimentary canal seemed to be specific to humans , and especially to males . Now , perhaps , we were prepared to indulge in some speculation ! Why did human males , and only human males , have certain skills ? Were they survival tools ? The brain trust at Slick 's Tavern offered its suggestions . Back home , however , peer review was skeptical . Lovely Linda felt fairly strongly that the two somatic resonances in question ( 1 ) had nothing to do with courtship , although she did accept the possibility that they ( 2 ) might be male defense mechanisms . ( Or , as she put it in both cases , " God knows ! " ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When do men belch and ... the other thing ? Men do these things most of all , best of all , when they are in packs , leaning up against pickup trucks , laughing and hoo-ha-ing in the company of other males . One might speculate that this " trumpeting " is therefore a male device used while jousting for pack dominance . But I have never been with a bunch of males doing those things when there has been even the slightest mood of challenge , positioning , or competition . If anything , at these moments there is a sense of community and camaraderie . As if we were pursuing some cooperative effort ... like hunting ! I would like to put on the anthropological table therefore the possibility that these male noises , considered rude in some circles today , may be Pleistocene memories of hunting calls . Since the sounds are clearly not analogous to any modern game animals , we can further surmise that they echo the mating calls of extinct creatures . If I can really go out on a scientific limb here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long-lost sounds of the ultimate Stone Age hunter 's prey  --  the woolly mammoth . ( The connection may seem strained , but when I recently asked researchers at the Smithsonian Institution , " Who invented the Whoopee Cushion ? " their response was , " That device 's origins are lost in the mists of the past . " Boy , does that tell the story or what ? ) Despite my belittling of the anthropological establishment , I offer it my profound gratitude . The AAA news release has opened an entirely new field of scientific inquiry to me . What can we make of hiccups ? Sneezes ? Root beer coming out our collective nose ? These lines of research are obviously not as attractive as , say , sequencing the human genome or analyzing the English ballad , but who can honestly say that this new direction will reveal any less about us , our origins and our ways ?
