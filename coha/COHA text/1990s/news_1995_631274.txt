<p> Phil Jackson cheats at Scrabble , has a natural distrust of microwave ovens , and can be just as off-beat with his children as he is with his players . <p> But the image is not the man . <p> " Yes , he 's deep-thinking , very philosophical and very , very intelligent , " said June Jackson , his wife of 22 years . " But he 's not one of these really complicated people . He 's just as confused as everyone else . " <p> Dave Wannstedt is so obsessed with football that he 'll forget his wife 's birthday , blank out in the middle of a conversation and get lost on his way home from work . <p> Even though his office and residence share a zip code . <p> " He 'll call me at night to let me know he 's coming home , " said wife Jan . " And then I 'll hear , ' Oh , darn , I 'm lost . I 'm somewhere in Lake Forest . I was thinking about something else and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll have to give him directions . " <p> Craig Hartsburg , the Blackhawks ' rookie coach , is forging a reputation as a master communicator . And that 's a stark contrast to the man who once spoke only when absolutely necessary . <p> " I ca n't believe the change in him , " said wife Peggy . " If you knew him before on a personal level , then listened to him now , you would n't believe the difference . " <p> Here 's a behind-the-scenes glimpse at three men who are pursuing championship rings , as seen through the eyes of the women who know them best . <p> They are the Jacksons , who might be nearing the end of an illustrious stay in Chicago , gearing up for a final championship run . <p> They are the Wannstedts , devoted to winning a Super Bowl and dropping roots in a city they 've come to love . <p> They are the Hartsburgs , pursuing their first big break with apprehension while their son stays behind in Canada . <p> And through all the hype @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are just like the rest of us . <p> June Jackson was driving around the suburbs two weeks ago , listening to sports radio , when she heard a commercial for the Chicago Rockers . <p> And her mind drifted to the days in Albany , N.Y. , when Phil was just another coach in the Continental Basketball Association . <p> " I was reminiscing about how fun that was , " she said . " We could go out in the public eye , we could go out to dinner , we had the whole team over to our house . I liked those years . There was something very special about it . " <p> Now , June is bracing for another season of chaos . But if she has her way , it 'll be over in two years . Her boys will have graduated from Deerfield High School , and it 'll probably be time to move on . <p> " Neither one of us has roots here , " she said . " And we have no illusions about that . This is not where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've been here , but when our kids are done with high school . . . " <p> What about Phil 's contract negotiations with the Bulls ? His current deal expires at the end of this season . <p> " They 're only talking two years , " she said . " Our boys are both juniors in high school . It would work real well for us timing-wise , and I think after a while , players get tired of the same voice . " <p> Certainly , the grind of six years in the NBA has taken its toll on Phil and June . <p> But there has been a change in Phil , and it occurred shortly after the death of Jerry Garcia , founder of the Grateful Dead . <p> " It was a real sad day , " June said . " My kids are all big fans of the Grateful Dead . They have all their CDs . But Phil was very blase about it . " <p> Misconception , No. 1 : Phil Jackson is a stereotypical Deadhead . In fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coach of the Bulls , Phil had seen the band only once . <p> " Phil was never a hippie , " June said . " He might 've had long curly hair , but he had a job , and he did not use drugs regularly . He may have had very brief experimentation , but it was nothing compared to what was going on then . <p> " Phil was never a flower child . He does n't even know their music like our kids know it . It 's all media hype . " <p> But Garcia 's death did have a definitive effect . <p> " It was the death of Jerry Garcia , the death of Mickey Mantle , and the resignation of ( former Knicks teammate and U.S. Senator ) Bill Bradley , " June said . " He saw his cohorts either dying or moving on , and it had a profound impact on him . I think he feels vulnerable , that life is short . <p> " And I think he 's willing to take more risks this year . I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He seems more aggressive to me . " <p> Such a revelation was n't apparent to June until her husband read her a speech he had written after their summer hiatus . <p> " But that 's how I find things out , " she said . " Phil is a master of avoidance . He loves to play with people 's heads , like throwing out words you wo n't understand . He 's learned that from his job , to answer without answering . " <p> But much of the mystique surrounding Phil is legitimate . He and his wife meditate , and last summer , Phil took his twin boys on a retreat to an Indian reservation in South Dakota . They sat for hours in a teepee , taking part in a mystical Native American ritual . <p> " And when he drives cross-country with the kids , they never take the interstate , " June said . <p> During their tenure in Chicago , the Jacksons have created a dependable routine . In season , Phil coaches the Bulls , while June does " everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phil , June and their four children ( Chelsea , 20 ; Brooke , 18 ; Charley and Ben , 16 ) head for their Montana ranch . <p> There is no television , and the only form of entertainment is National Public Radio . <p> " Phil does one thing in Illinois  --  he coaches the Bulls , " June said . " In Montana , he 's a father , a handyman , a reader , and he 's more physically active . It 's a good time for us to bond as a family . " <p> And it 's one of the only times , since June refuses to play board games with her husband . <p> " He 's way too competitive , " June said . " We used to play Scrabble , but I 'm done . He makes up words , and he is so determined to convince you that the word exists that you ca n't challenge him . " <p> But he will listen , and even take advice . A hospice social worker with a master 's degree , June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his team . There are also times when her opinion is n't so valued . <p> " It would never occur to me to bother him because he sets up this wall and you just know , " she said . " It usually takes him a whole night of sleeping on it , and then he starts talking . He 's a real delayed kind of guy , even when he 's picking out a parking spot . So when it comes to reaction , I know I 'm not going to see it for 10-12 hours . " <p> And yet , controlling chaos has became her husband 's specialty . After dealing with Scottie Pippen 's sit-down act , and the return of Michael Jordan , well , his perspective has begun to change . <p> " I really think Phil is mellowing a bit , " she said . " I think he 's getting more comfortable with the losses . " <p> And thanks to a new friendship with Jan Wannstedt , June has become more content in her role as coach 's spouse . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her van , and she got a call on her cellular phone , " June said . " It was Dave , and he was looking for a certain phone number . Jan had this little office right there in her van , and she starts paging through sheets of paper . And I thought I did a lot . " <p> The goose statue on the front porch is adorned with a Bears ' jersey and a Bears ' helmet . The ceramic pumpkin on the kitchen counter has a smile that reads , " ' Go Bears . " <p> No question that football rules the Wannstedt house . <p> " One time he brought film home , and I got so sick of watching a guy run forward , then backward , forward , then backward , " Jan said . " But you have to understand , this is all we 've ever known . " <p> Indeed , the Wannstedts  --  married for 23 years  --  are the Western Pennsylvania cliche . She was a high school cheerleader , he was the player who went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 've had but one plan . <p> " We still talk about that , " she said . " We could 've been happy where we came from . We always thought that we 'd get married , I 'd be a school teacher and he would be coaching at some high school . And if that 's what we 're doing 10 years from now , it will still be wonderful . " <p> The reason they 're not is the same reason Jan rarely sees her husband . Every morning , Dave gets up early , goes to 6:30 mass and heads to work . He 'll be home at 10:30 . . . on a good night . <p> " He loves what he does , I love what he does , and my girls ( Keri , 18 ; Jami , 15 ) love what he does , " Jan said . " So it does n't bother us . And , tell me , who works from 9-to-5 and gets anywhere ? " <p> But with such little time , there are compromises to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of night with football thoughts , but sometimes he 'll wake up with thoughts about the kids , " Jan said . <p> Like last week , when Keri 's first phone bill arrived from Indiana University . <p> " It was a little higher than it needs to be , so he woke up at 2:30 in the morning thinking about it , " Jan said . " He went into her room , and said , ' Let 's talk about this . ' He got it off his chest , and then he came back and went to bed . But he 's very close with the girls . " <p> The one staple is the family vacation , but even that has taken a hit recently . Last year , Dave felt like he had to get back to the office , so the vacation was shortened to six days . Jan has since adjusted . <p> " This year , instead of making it seven days , we 'll make it six , " she said . " We know he 'll probably want to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been so much different . After graduating Pitt , Dave wanted to work for the FBI . He read a few books on the subject , and went to a regional office , inquiring about employment . <p> " He would 've loved to have done it , the suspense of the whole thing , " Jan said . " Fortunately , it never developed . " <p> Now , he coaches football , and Jan conducts football clinics for women . As for relaxation ? <p> " We 'll take walks , " Jan said . " And sometimes ( offensive line coach ) Tony ( Wise ) will come over , and the two will smoke cigars . Then I 'll walk ahead so the cigar draft is behind me . " <p> Yes , their existence revolves around football . So what ? According to Jan , they are simple folk from Pennsylvania with strong values and a strong work ethic . And life could n't be better . <p> " He 's pretty much the same as he 's always been , " Jan said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar and have a beer as opposed to going to a real fluffy restaurant . We 're just more comfortable with the hard-working people , the construction workers , because that 's where we 're from . <p> " I remember , going on dates to a pizza place , and driving though the nice neighborhoods . I 'd say , ' Would n't it be nice if we could ever get a house like that someday ? ' " <p> Someday has arrived for Craig and Peggy Hartsburg . Last year , he was coaching the Guelph Storm , a junior hockey team in the Ontario league . And after one year of stunning success , he was hired to coach the Blackhawks . <p> " Everything is so new , so hectic , " said Peggy , his wife of 16 years . " We 're kind of in awe , actually . " <p> Especially for a wife who has seen an amazing transformation in her husband . When Craig was a defenseman for the Minnesota North Stars , he was a quiet , follow-my-footsteps kind of leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went to a few symposiums and really got into listening and reading and speaking with psychologists , " Peggy said . " It made him think , ' How am I going to get my point across ? ' <p> " He really came out of his shell . It 's almost like this is what he was meant to do . " <p> The Guelph Storm took to his methods , and were 47-14-5 , falling in the finals of the Memorial Cup . And now there 's another cup to be had . <p> " He feels the pressure , but I keep telling him to do his thing , that once you 're here a while , you can put your stamp on the team , " Peggy said . " I still think he feels like he has to prove himself in the NHL . " <p> Craig 's sudden rise in the coaching ranks has n't been easy . While Katie , 13 , has immediately adapted , their son Chris , 15 , has remained in Canada to play junior hockey . He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive every other weekend . <p> Not the easiest thing for a pair of " homebodies " . <p> " We left it totally up to Chris , " Peggy said . " It 's scary to think that Craig dropped him off at the end of August and wo n't see him until Dec. 29 . They 're pretty close , so it 's a big adjustment for all of us . " <p> The biggest adjustment might come from Hawks fans who wo n't find the theatrical , goalie-pulling style of Mike Keenan or the stone-faced manner of Darryl Sutter . <p> " He might blow up in the dressing room , but it 'll be behind closed doors , " Peggy said . " He 's just one of the most genuinely nice people around . He makes me mad sometimes because he 's so nice . I think , ' Ca n't you ever get mad ? ' But he 's not fake in anything he does . " <p> As long as the results are the same , no one will mind a bit . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that 's his goal as a coach , " Peggy said . " We 're hoping that things are going to work out , and we 'll be here a long time . " <p> That , of course , depends on one thing . <p> " Winning , " Peggy said . " We know that . "
