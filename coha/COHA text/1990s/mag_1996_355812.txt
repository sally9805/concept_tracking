INSIDE THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES <P> Last Week the National Archives disgorged 28,000 documents from the Nixon era . Among them , TIME 's Hugh Sidey found a Dec. 11 , 1970 , memo from Nixon suggesting a letter be written to Sidey and sent by " one of our people " posing as an admirer . Excerpts from the memo : <P> " Dear Mr. Sidey , My must reading includes every week your perceptive and brilliant columns ... However , I wonder if you really are portraying an accurate picture of this man ? From your columns I would get the impression that he was introverted , humorless , rather plotting sic and not particularly exciting in his conduct of the Presidency ... I think for your own credibility you ought to correct the image you have left . I do n't mean that I like him ( frankly I would have to classify myself as a Lindsey sic Republican ... ) I feel this so strongly , because I detest Vice President Agnew and am repelled by his attacks on the press . But if millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then read a column by a respected journalist like you which appears to be patently biasted sic against him , the very dangerous Agnew theme ... will gain much credance sic ... " <P> TOBACCO FASHIONS : VENI , BIDI , VICI <P> This is the little cigarette that could : it came , it saw , it conquered . The trendiest smoke on college campuses these days emanates from Indian imports called beedies ( from the Hindi bidi ) . About half the diameter of regular cigarettes and hand rolled in tendu ( Indian ebony leaves ) , they look slightly like microcigars . Beedies , however , pack a much more powerful punch : up to 8% nicotine , versus the 1% to 2% in American cigarettes . The imports are composed of a species of tobacco different from that most commonly used by U.S. manufacturers . They also come in flavors : clove , menthol and even strawberry . Popular brands include Mangalore Ganesh and Kailas . Despite the buzz that beedies deliver , FDA analysis finds they contain no hallucinogens . Says Suresh Ralapati , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms : " Perhaps the fact that they look like joints interests the young people . " Beedies cost from $2.50 to $3 per pack of 20 . ( A pack of unfiltered Camels can range from $1.25 to $3.15 . ) Why the expense for such tiny smokes ? In 1994 the ATF reclassified beedies as cigarettes rather than cigars , thus imposing a tax rate about 10 times as high as was previously charged . Though they may have cult status in America , beedies have little cachet back in India , where more than 800 billion are smoked each year . They remain what they have always been , says Ralapati , " the poor man 's cigarette .
