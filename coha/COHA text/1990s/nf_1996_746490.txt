One of the underlying assumptions of special education legislation is that families , educators , and physicians , as well as many other service providers , will collaborate in sharing information , solving problems , planning , and providing services to children who have disabilities . The law has created , in theory , a family-health-education partnership for delivering services . However , obstacles exist to mutual understanding and clear communication between these partners . Each defines situations within a particular framework , and each has unique criteria for evaluation , parameters for intervention , and goals . That framework is the standard by which each side defines , interprets , and judges a course of action . <p> This article is based on ( a ) a comprehensive review of the cumulative files of preschool children  --  one of whom will be highlighted , ( b ) school observations , and ( c ) interviews with involved parents , physicians , and education personnel . The article is based on one component of a larger study that examines how health and medical information is used in planning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions ( Morse , 1990a ) . Educators Speak <p> Medical treatment , as separate from health interventions that look at the total child , is disease specific . A diagnosis is made and a treatment prescribed . The treatment is directly related to the diagnosis . The results can be directly observed . In education , however , the diagnosis establishes a label , but labels do not lead to educational treatment . Therefore , treatment in the school setting is based upon descriptive reporting of how a child is functioning rather than the label . <p> For example , the medical professional responds to a child 's seizures by prescribing medication and carefully monitoring the child 's response . The education professional , on the other hand , is concerned about the child 's readiness for interactions and instruction . The educator 's prime concern is how the seizures interfere with the child 's ability to sustain attention and then to determine the appropriate techniques that will bring the child back to task following a seizure . Educators work to increase the child 's functioning by using such education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determining what activities and techniques motivate the child . These treatment considerations are independent of the child 's label , whether it be seizures , blindness , hyperactivity , autism , or mental retardation . <p> Most of the education staff interviewed in the study perceived the biological basis of children 's conditions as interesting , occasionally helpful , but not directly applicable to the educational process . Special education legislation , court decisions , and the policy of zero rejection mean that the child is entitled to education regardless of the cause or nature of the handicapping condition . What staff want to know is whether the diagnosis tells anything about methods and materials of instruction , patterns of skill development , or management of behavior . They want to know what the diagnosis means in relation to how best to teach the child . They need information that has applied educational relevance . When asked about coordination efforts with physicians , the primary complaint I heard was that it is the rare physician who asks about the child 's overall level of functioning and performance on different types of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behavioral information may be very useful to the physician in determining a medical course of action or demonstrating that a course of action is correct or needs to be modified . Physicians Speak <p> Some of the physicians I interviewed advised that educators needed to be alert to , but not overwhelmed or frightened by , medical information . Sometimes , they said , it is easy to get immersed in medical facts that can , on many occasions , be deceiving in terms of usefulness . The education system needs to be alert to not losing track of its roots , that is , to being able to look expertly at how children function and how they can be helped to function better . <p> The more common physician perspective , held mostly by specialists , was that people who have not had medical training need to understand that there are some very important kinds of information they must know if they are going to appropriately educate and care for children with disabilities within the classroom setting . That view perceives that the central nervous system function or dysfunction determines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physician said , the child 's behavior " is a response to both external and internal events that are acted upon by the environment . Even physicians do n't have a very good understanding of the genesis of a lot of the behaviors or what to do about them . " <p> These physicians felt that the lack of a solid base of understanding creates situations in which " teachers seem to be very judgmental about what physicians are doing . " Teachers need to know what medical specialists can and can not do in addressing medical issues , why and when certain diagnostic tests are performed , the limits of diagnostic procedures in answering questions that have classroom implications , and why medications may be changed relatively frequently and quickly . This level of understanding presupposes that educators have some level of knowledge about neurological function and dysfunction , which , one physician said , " is sadly lacking . " <p> The physicians were extremely vocal that educators need to be aware of the distinction between what physicians need to know and the amount of information they are able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IEP in a manner that would characterize what is going on with the child . What services are being provided in what type of educational program ? What is the teacher 's name , address , and phone number ? What related services are provided ? Physicians are used to dealing with related service people in hospital settings so they usually have a quicker understanding of what these specialists are doing with a child than they might have with the functions of the teacher . Which aspects of the IEP require the physician 's consent , as for example physical and occupational therapy ? A brief description of the anticipated goals over the coming 6 months or a year . What are the areas of concern , conflict , and unresolved questions , particularly medical issues that require the physician 's attention . <p> Two of the physicians I interviewed requested that IEP 's not be sent . " It is probably a waste of money and copying time . It 's not likely that we 're going to sit down and read it . " Albert : A Case Study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ventricular hemorrhages , hyperbilirubinemia secondary to prematurity , anemia , apnea , and respiratory distress syndrome . He required two ventriculotomies and eventually a shunt before being discharged from the hospital at the end of his 2nd month . Since that time , Albert has had a shunt revision , a hernia repair , two eye surgeries , a tonsillectomy , and an adenoidectomy . Albert receives audiological and routine well-child pediatric care near his home . In addition , an ophthalmologist and neurologist in a neighboring state and a comprehensive orthopedic team in a third state examine Albert regularly . He is educationally diagnosed as visually handicapped , orthopedically handicapped , speech- and language-impaired , and deaf . His IQ , according to the psychologist , is solid in the average range . <p> Current trends in the education of children with special needs support collaboration among the family and education and medical systems . In this study , the interactions among parents , educators , and physicians were really interactions between world-views , self-views , and roles . For example , Albert has a precarious walk and stooped posture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His orthopedic handicaps were obvious , and the first to be diagnosed . The cause was clear , and the treatment , through physical and occupational therapy , was also clear . Once these physical ailments were ameliorated , the prognosis was not so explicit , and the parents accelerated their demands for increased physical and occupational therapy . Their demands generated much frustration for the school team , as evidenced by the psychologist who said , <p> If the parents are hoping that all his Albert 's delays are physically based , then finding an environment that accommodates to his physical needs will make everything okay everywhere else . This may be the parents ' assumption and hope . The Parents Perspective <p> Albert 's parents zealously accept their role as advocates for their son  --  especially around issues related to therapies . They frequently lock horns , so to speak , with the education system when they work to " make them school staff understand and address his physical needs . . . . He 's not doing as well as he could be , " says Albert 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has come . . . that the original prognoses were really negative by some physicians . And he has really overcome them . . . . We are n't going to be parents that they are going to have to come to and say have you ever looked at such and such a problem . . . If you truly care about your child , simply go and take care of it . <p> When asked what she meant by " take care of it , " Albert 's mother made a comparison with a broken sink . If it were broken , " you 'd call a plumber to fix it . " The demands for more physical and occupational therapy and for more speech therapy appear , to the parents , to have paid off : Albert walks and talks . And he sees and hears  --  most of the time . He is on the road to being " fixed . " <p> Albert 's parents want their child to be as normal as possible and they bring to bear on this desire a large cache of emotional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they have the most to win or lose . The Educators ' Perspective <p> A bit removed from the parents are the educators who share the parents ' desire to have Albert function as well as possible . Because educators primarily see treatment as helping the child to learn , their focus is on a particular setting and set of interventions : how to secure Albert 's attention , what techniques to use to bring him back to task , what strategies to increase attentiveness , what adaptations are needed to promote maximum independence . <p> The speech pathologist said , " It does n't really matter what it is or what the doctors call it . . . . There are certain things that you do for some kinds of children and certain things that you do for other kinds of disorders . " The education team feels they know the appropriate strategies to use with Albert . In comparing Albert 's educational needs with those of a child who has a severe seizure condition , the speech pathologist said , <p> With Rebecca you do n't really have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And what works today does n't necessarily work tomorrow . Albert is more consistent . Once he learns something , he has it . It 's just because it 's a more concrete kind of disability that we 're dealing with . We know exactly what he 's doing , what he has , and does n't have and the problems . There are concrete activities that can be done in the classroom . We know enough about hearing loss . We may not be able to come up with the perfect solution right away but at least there are certain things that we can try . The same with the visual handicap . There are those things that need to be done . <p> The educators ' role , too , is heavily laden with expectations  --  their own and those of the parents . Each year when it is time to review a child 's progress on the IEP the staff feel that they , as well as the child , are being examined . One teacher said : <p> I get so nervous this time of year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've made so much progress and maybe the children did n't make as much progress on this specific thing . . . on the measurable type things and I have to write that  --  and put it on next year 's IEP . I feel that that 's a reflection on me as a teacher . The Physicians ' Perspective <p> Perhaps the farthest removed ( without implying something negative by " remove " ) are the physicians , who measure , evaluate , diagnose , and advise . Their involvement with Albert is with the child as a subject to be studied for useful recommendations . That approach does not mean that they do not care about him , only that their care , dictated by their roles , usually does not extend beyond a cursory involvement in the deeper processes of his life . For example , after each of Albert 's visits , the neurologist and orthopedist send a report to the school . Historically , each of these reports recommends increased occupational , physical , and speech therapy  --  medically related services most familiar to physicians and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ None of these reports mention services to promote increased efficiency in the functional use of vision and hearing and appropriate classroom modifications . Albert 's visual and auditory handicaps are not as visible ; the parents do not view them as major concerns  --  especially because Albert tolerates his glasses and hearing aids well . Blending the Perceptions <p> The effort to help a child with disabilities can become a contest between different groups with different aims , goals , and expectations . The child 's treatment is grounded in the simultaneous competing and complementary actions of three systems  --  family , medical , and educational . This push-pull is as much a part of the treatment plans for the children as is the medical and education information . In this study , the effectiveness and ease with which the various systems communicated with each other depended , in large part , on whether the handicap was overt or hidden . That fact influenced diagnosis and prognosis , which , in turn , affected treatment . Even if the disability was visible ( Albert 's physical challenges ) and if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system held differing beliefs regarding the nature and prognosis of the treatment . <p> Parents make one of three requests to the medical establishment about their child 's condition : fix it as well as possible because it is broken ( as were Albert 's physical challenges ) , cure it and make it completely well , or ameliorate it and improve it ( as were Albert 's visual and auditory disabilities ) . In this study , wrangling over etiology and treatment occurred when each system defined different answers to two questions , What is the matter ? and What should be done ? Or , in other words , the degree to which the perceptions of each group declared that a particular course of action would fix , cure , or ameliorate the problem determined how they would act , what information they would ask for and accept , and what expectations they would harbor . Miscommunication and misunderstanding arose because each group defined the three options differently . <p> Albert 's precipitous birth was traumatic . Many of the challenges that resulted from his birth are obvious even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Albert walk , and his hearing aids and speech training have enabled him to hear and talk . Glasses and low vision aids help him to see . He is on the road to being fixed . Albert 's mother remembers when he was discharged from the neonatal intensive care unit . She lives by the recipe on how best to " fix " a broken child . " My feeling is that if other parents truly care about their child and not how they are perceived , they would simply go and take care of the child 's problem . " <p> Fix-it expectations carry a higher voltage as it were , than ameliorate-it , because of a clash between the kind of child the parents want and the child they have . Inevitably , fix-it and cure-it are bound up with notions of normalcy . The lack of fit between the normal child and the child that the parents are caring for can cause friction between the parents and those professionals attached to the education and medical care of the child . The fix-it view is evident in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The medical and education establishments have their versions , of fix-it and cure-it , and these motivate the particular kinds of diagnoses they make for a child . The special education model of diagnosis is , at heart , fix-it , based on a deficit model that defines handicaps and then plans strategies to eradicate these deficiencies . The prime goal is to have improved functioning as measured in the education setting , but not necessarily healthy functioning as an individual member of society . The child is educationally cured when special education and related services are determined to be no longer necessary . <p> The medical model , in this study , tended to be more cure-it , with fix-it as a means to that end . Medical diagnosis tried to identify the underlying causes of a condition and then treat them in order to make everything as healthy as possible . The problem is , of course , that even refined medical information does not predict how efficiently the child will perform in functional activities or suggest ways to help the child maximize his or her skills  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urgently . Conclusions <p> New opportunities are opening up for children with special needs , partly because of advances in technology and partly as the results of advocacy . Current trends indicate that more and more children with severe disabling conditions will be included in their neighborhood schools . The Council for Exceptional Children , in 1988 , estimated that 100,000 infants and children identified as having very dependent medical needs , would enter the schools during the 1990s . Many of these students would have medical and health conditions far beyond the training and experience of most teachers , administrators , and therapists . The Council warned schools to be prepared for children who may be dependent on ventilators , tracheotomy tubes , and gastrostomy tube feeding . Personnel would need expertise in the operation of heart monitors and the administration of oxygen . CEC also forecasted that children to be served would include another population , namely those with communicable conditions . <p> We , in the field of education , have seen the 1988 CEC predictions come to pass . And we have seen that the requirements for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medicine and education . Simultaneously , judicial decisions and the advocacy movements have empowered parents to be equal decision makers . If the findings of my study are not isolated phenomena , it appears that more effective communication among families , medicine , and education may best be facilitated through some of the following recommendations provided by those I interviewed : Physicians should receive more in-depth training in developmental disabilities , community service systems , and interdisciplinary communication . University-affiliated programs are models for interdisciplinary training ( Morse , 1990b ) . Educators should receive training in the neurological and medical implications of developmental disabilities . Some physicians suggested that educators need to improve their skills in documenting and communicating effective educational practices . Again , university-affiliated programs are models for such training ( Andrews , 1995 ; Morse , 1990b ) . Both physicians and teachers in-training should experience apprenticeships not only in their own profession but in the other as well . Such experiences could improve interdisciplinary communication as well as new models of pediatric and educational care ( Morse , 1990b ) . Practicing educators and physicians should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their knowledge base and communicative skills . School systems should consider contracting with a local pediatrician for a certain number of hours per year to review , summarize , and interpret children 's records and to work with classroom staff in developing appropriate individual health plans similar to IEPs . In reverse , someone in the education realm should summarize the child 's school situation for the physician . For many doctors , the amount of detail in an IEP is tedious , difficult to read , boring , and beyond their capacity . Many physicians have calling hours . Educators might consider using that time to ask questions and share observations . The secretary should be alerted ahead of time about the impending phone call and given time to prepare the chart for the physician . This type of communication also requires that the educator be specific in outlining who is making the phone call and clearly delineating the issues in jargon-free language . When the child enters the program , writing a brief one-page note to the physician introducing the education contact person and providing a phone number is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the physician with the name of a specific person . There are two prime reasons to consider using the school nurse as the contact person : The child may change teachers from one year to another , but the school nurse usually remains as a constant ; and the school nurse has medical training and knows how to use health-care resources . If the nurse does not have a background in developmental disabilities , training programs have been developed to address this need . <p>
