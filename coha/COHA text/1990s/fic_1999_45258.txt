Now what I 'm telling is from Master W.S. , his play Jew of Venice , which only after years gone after 1596 , when it first played , they call now Merchant of Venice . What I 'm telling now is how in his play Jew of Venice Master W.S. wrote about me , Pincus Perlmutter , all to make mean gleeks about Jews he did , and also of course to make monies for himself because of how most English , Court and London citizens also , was still talking from Dr. Lopez , the Sephardic Jew from Spain was physician to Queen Bess , which Dr. Lopez got his kopf chopped off . Also the rack torture they did him before so he confessed he tried to poison Queen Bess . And also W.S. wrote this Jew of Venice play because of Kit Marlowe who before wrote a play , Jew of Malta , this also about Dr. Lopez , in 1594 it made monies a lot , so W.S. wrote his to get monies also . Mostly I think he wrote Jew of Venice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Pincus Perlmutter , because I 'm a Jew , though not Sephardic like Dr. Lopez , I 'm Ashkenazi from the country of the Poles and also Moscovies , which do pogroms . Listen . <p> Dr. Lopez , the Sephardic Jew from Spain , was physician to Queen Bess , possibly a great physician he was , her favorite , and Queen Bess was always fearing she would be took sick and starb of a sudden , so took physics and nostrums and potions and smeared salves on her skin lots , which Dr. Lopez made and gave her . I myself heard from Court how once her tooth rotted and her whole punim face swelled up and hurt from this bad tooth . So her doctors-she had lots ! - said it should be drawn out to get out poison humors was gathering all in her jaw by this rotted tooth . But she was afraid to have her tooth drawn , she was fearful always from any pains . But her doctors , they said it do n't hurt so much , which to prove , one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lopez , to show Queen Bess it did n't hurt so much , he had one of his tooths , a good one not rotted , drawn from his head . After which she let them draw her rotted one . This I heard from Court personages told me , not Dr. Lopez it was n't , who I knew only a little , he did n't much speak with me because he was Sephardic from Spain and the queen 's most favored physician , and how I was Ashkenazi from east in Europe , so thought he was my better I think , also possibly because I was from theater people and not Court . <p> Which I say still now he was n't . He was maybe a great physician , Queen Bess 's favorite , but also a devious schemer and deceiver I think , he was probably doing intelligences from Court to Spain which he should n't . And he made a big mistake , he talked slanders against Essex the earl , who was also then a favorite , the same as Charlie Blount , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What Dr. Lopez said , from Essex he said rumors Essex had a pox he would make sick with it any woman he did indecent congress with , which was because Essex everybody at Court knew he wanted to do with the queen , shtup her , except she never let him , and later took his head also when he rebelled . So Dr. Lopez was saying this slander to bring down Essex so he could be the most favorite of Queen Bess . Essex 's place , and also Charlie Blount 's he wanted , I think . <p> Which was the worst mistake , because Essex talked his own rumors and slanders , that Dr. Lopez was a intelligencer spy from Spain , and because English hated Spain , and because English was afraid from Jews and hated them also , the public , Hob and Dick and Court gallants and country nobles , even rude mechanics , they believed these slanders against Dr. Lopez , so Essex got the queen to put Dr. Lopez on the rack for torture , which is where any person will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did , confessed he wanted to poison Queen Bess for Spain , and so they chopped off his kopf with a axe , this I saw happen , and I say still it was wrong and a shame , three blows from the axe it took because Dr. Lopez did n't bless the headsman and also possibly did n't tip enough . Wrong I think to kill a person mostly because he was a Jew from Spain , which most English hated and feared . <p> Which events made Kit Marlowe 's Jew of Malta get crowds to fill the theater , fifteen times the Lord Admiral 's Players did Kit Marlowe 's play , so they got monies lots , which is why Master W.S. wrote his Jew of Venice to play finally in 1596 so he would also get monies . <p> And also to make mean gleeks from me , Pincus Perlmutter , who everyone in Court and theater knew I was also a Jew , the close friend of Will Kempe the great comic actor and part-owner later from The Globe . Which is why W.S. the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his play from the character Shylock he wrote . <p> This Shylock , I 'm telling , is me , Pincus Perlmutter , the butt from the play 's mean and also coarse jesting . This I knew then in ' 96 , and still years gone now I believe true . <p> From the play you can see this I 'm telling is true . Look the Folio , from 1600 , from a prompter 's copy written in the hand of Master W.S. you can see I 'm telling true about this because it shows in the text . <p> So now I 'll tell also how my Will Kempe , he played Launcelot Gobbo , a clown , a servant to Shylock , all gleeks and raillery he did it , like always the greatest comic jape in England ever was , making merry the groundlings who paid a penny to see him do this ! I do n't say my Will was himself as a person , my friend so close we was like brothers in blood born , I do n't say that himself he made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did , still thinking from Dr. Lopez , dead two years only then in ' 96 . Only what W.S. wrote , the words from the play , this my Will said only because it was his performance . <p> They did rehearsals , and I helped like always my Will Kempe to study and commit his words in the play , which he always had troubles with because he was so much drinking strong beer and spiced and sugared wine and other things also , the shikker he was ! So when I saw rehearsals and also read Will Kempe his words , I said to him , " Will , this play is all from Jews , mean gleeks and sharp sallies and mockery , from Dr. Lopez he 's writing this play to make mockeries from Jews like me ! " <p> To which my Will said , " Marry , sweet Pinky , doth not good Master Shakescene make a sad tragic soul in poor Shylock ? And is not all this play but a treasure stole in the writing from dear Kit Marlowe 's ? And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our purse will buy us meat and drink and mayhap merry times among arrant knaves no better than we , and the loose wenches come always home to the sound of a coin flung on a tavern 's table , as true as doves fly home to the cote when day fades ? Nay , Pinky , protest not ! Read me my words that I may set them to memory , and so not vex Master William with my own devising when I forget them , but so speak them as Master Shakepiece wrote . Now forego this talk of Jews and dead Lopez , not worth your choler , Pinky sweet ! " <p> So I did n't say more from this to my Will Kempe , just practiced him his words in the play , which he learned hard because he was half-fap from strong beer and spiced wines and other drink , but still I knew what I knew and still know is true , now when I 'm telling . Launcelot Gobbo , which Gobbo means hunchback in the Italian , which is also what W.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Italian comedies which was then very popular in Queen Bess 's realm of England then and also since . His play also what I said , he only changed from Kit Marlowe 's Malta to Italian Venice . <p> From the mean sallies against Jews I 'll tell . <p> First , that if it 's a ew , this Shylock , then monies is all he loves . Which is saying Jews do usury lending money to Christians , which is a double gleek , ironics , because lending at interest I knew many gallants and country gentles , also rich mercantiles from London , also did this . Notjust Jews did usury in England ! What I also know is once hundreds of years before this the English made all Jews go from the realm because they did usury , but had to let them come back because they needed money for their wars and to raise royal armies and also navies to fight Hollanders and French and Spain and also to put down insurrections also . <p> Lies is what W. S. wrote in this play Jew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I am a Jew myself , if only Ashkenazi not Sephardic , and speak only true of this ! That Jews love only monies is lies in this play W. S. did to make monies himself , stealing also his play from Kit Marlowe 's , and from Dr. Lopez the Sephardic Jew from Spain , and also from the Italian comedy he also stole , the comic doctor Gratiano he stole from Italians . <p> From monies and Jews in the play is Shylock , which is me , Pincus Perlmutter ! Look the Folio , second act , the fifth scene , Shylock says he dreams from moneybags . Me , I can say true I never dreamed from bags of money in my whole long life ! It 's true I kept the common purse for both myself and my Will Kempe , but only because my Will was such a shikkerwho loved carouse , we would n't have no monies to buy meats or clothes or hire lodgings if I did n't keep close to me our common purse . If I cared for monies it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squander on drink and kurvehs whores if I did n't keep our purse and tally regular our monies from his performance . <p> Look the Folio , where this Shylock cries out when his daughter Jessica runs away to marry with Lorenzo , this Shylock cries out for both daughter and his ducats , which is gold coin from Venice , like they was the same to him . W. S. shows lies here , that a Jew loves his monies as dear as his daughter , this I know is a lie because I am also a Jew , and even that I never had a child , since I never married with a woman in my life , still I know true , if I did , I would love my child I never had more than any monies ! Look the Folio , the third act , the first scene from this play of lies about Jews , this Shylock tells Tubal , which is another Jew , he says he wishes his daughter Jessica dead at his feet so he could have back his Venetian gold ducats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Pincus Perlmutter , never wishes any person no matter who to be dead before his time . <p> Even in this play , the same scene , this Shylock himself says he 's just like a Christian , he bleeds and eats and dies , a mensch like any person a Jew is , so it proves , right in the Folio you can see , how a Jew ca n't be different from any mensch . I am a Jew , and I got to eat meats and have drink and sleep , and I weep tears for my tsuris griefs in life like any mensch , so it ca n't be true from Jews what is n't from me ! To say , like W. S. did in Jew of Venice , Jews are like the devil is lies . <p> Also another lie from Jews in this play is they hate Christians . Which maybe some do if they get spit on and also called dogs and devil and also other curses-this I know myself from years gone when I walked in England the country with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I 'll tell of . A forged warrant I had to get me to walk the country when I sold Wonder Books and other dreck , because if I did n't have a warrant , English yokels and swains and bumpkins knew I was a Jew , they spit me and said me curses and made a cross from their fingers and shouted me to sneck up , go hang myself , and get me hence I heard from boys threw clods and stones at me from being I was a Jew-which is why I got a forger to make me a warrant so they would n't know I was a Jew . <p> This could cause a person to hate possibly , this is true . But who was the great friend I made in my life ? Who was close as blood born brother to me , Pincus Perlmutter , in his whole life ? Was it a Jew ? <p> No ! It was my sweet Will Kempe who I managed his performances from before The Globe he part-owned to the greatest darejourney in England ever , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I never married with a woman and did n't have a child in this long life , but I loved a person like he was my brother or my son I never had , Will Kempe , who was n't a Jew . So when this Jew of Venice play says Shylock hates Christian people , it 's maybe possible when he was spit on and cursed and his monies and jewels stole and his daughter Jessica run away to marry Lorenzo , maybe he could hate , but I say this Shylock was me W. S. wrote from mean intention , and I never hated no persons ever , and the only mensch I loved in this life was my Will Kempe the great and famous comic Fool , who was not a Jew , a Christian born he was , even if I never saw him pray or keep fast days or go hear a sermon in a church . So another lie in this play . <p> And as bad a lie , worse I think , is what in this play W. S. wrote from Launcelot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a comic performance he did very good like always his performance of whatever-the words he said we studied , and also he did funny turns , crossed his eyes and wiggled his bum and such the groundlings loved , but W. S. did n't . Launcelot Gobbo in this play from lies is the servant of this Shylock the Jew . Which I 'm telling is W. S. had mean intention in this , because theater folk and some even from Court loved the playgoing , knew from me and Will Kempe how close as brothers we was , how I kept our common purse and took care from him like I was his manservant , I barbered his hair and also his scraggly bart , and combed powder through his hair to clean it from schmutz . <p> When he was fap drunk cupshotten or sick with the blue-eye from drinking , how I cleaned his clothes when he fell fap in mud or street filths or spewed himself , how I wiped him clean and tried to stop him from going to Southwark stews for kurvehs whores could easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat the best fares , pickled oysters in a barrel and neat 's tongues , which is from a ox , and marrow bones I boiled , and cakes and sweetmeats and kissing comfits-how I tied his points and garters and kept safe his motley and bells was willed to him by the great Fool Joe Tarleton in his will , all this theater folk and also many from Court and London citizens knew , so that in this play Launcelot Gobbo , which Will Kempe played , servant to the Jew Shylock , which is me , this was all a mean jape at me and my Will . <p> Look the Folio from 1600 , you can see how mean the jape ! Launcelot Gobbo hates the Jew Shylock and leaves his service and even helps the daughter Jessica to steal ducats and jewels from Shylock , which is W. S. making a mean jape from me and my Will , saying my Will should leave from me taking care of him and our common monies and my helping his performance . <p> This it very much hurt me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Venice , to see myself and my Will Kempe , to hear gallants and Court people and citizens who knew us laugh not only from lies about Jews but also laugh at me and my Will because we was close as blood brothers born , but on the stage Launcelot Gobbo hates the Jew Shylock and leaves his service and also helps rob his ducats and jewels , making a mean jape to mock me and my Will . This I still think is worse than lies about Jews , which there 's even more in this play . <p> So W. S. writes the Jew Shylock wo n't eat no pork , and by the end of this play is also a gleek he wrote from the price of pork , mean-spirited , and also lies . Which it 's true I learned in cheder in my home country of the Poles and pogrom Moscovies , in my stetl village when I was a bubbe boy we Jews should n't eat from pork and also not shrimps and oysters and other tref , but when I came to England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only fare at a tavern or cookhouse , and oysters my Will and I bought in barrels , pickled , and I eat all this and never worried from the price of whatever meats , pork or beefs or ducks and swans or rabbits hashed with lambs , we eat ! <p> And also not only Jews W.S. made a mean intention jape against , also blackamoors . Look the Folio prompter 's copy from Jew of Venice , see the second act , the seventh scene , the Prince of Monaco , a blackamoor he wrote him with gleeks from his black skin , Portia says Let all of his complexion choose me so when he picks from the wrong casket to win her hand . Also later , 1604 it was , he did a play Othello with many mean gleeks like . <p> What I 'm telling is Master W.S. was not a true mensch to do such in his plays , especially from what he wrote from Jews in this Jew of Venice ! Which I say is the worst a person can be , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puns and gleeks he wrote , like all his plays . In this play , from ginger he makes a gleek because English believe ginger is what old ladies eat to make them lust hot . A lewd jest he made , from saying stake down , which is from a wager , but in this play is a pun on a indecent wager , Nerissa and Gratiano speaking from indecent dalliance is a sport you could wager on , like it was archery or lawn bowls or some other , except in this play it means filthy congress dalliance . And from the end of the play , puns he made about pens and rings , which is gleeks about people 's , men and women , their parts covered by codpieces and plackets . Crudeness he wrote , that bagpipe music makes some men to lose their water , which is crudeness country talk you should easy hear from louts and rogues , but this is in his play ! <p> So I say this Jew of Venice was a play W.S. stole and wrote for monies , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who even with masque musics and attire his actors wore , this play was a mean intention jape against me , Pincus Perlmutter , and against my Will Kempe my almost blood born brother , and also mostly coarse gleeks this play is . <p> When it was done playing , Jew of Venice , my Will said to me because I said so much about this play to him , " Pinky sweet , I do think you think Master Shakewell limned his Shylock after your own likeness , an if you do then you 're both fool , as I am , and knave like unto Master Shaketail himself ! " " I do , " I said to my Will . <p> To which he said , " Put folly by , my Pinky ! A play 's naught but a play . And only as good as we players render it . And was it not well done by all , even myself ? Did you not mark how merry I made my groundlings all when I did mime breaking wind , and squeezed the air out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I seen , " I said to him , " and I seen them laugh , how you wiggled your bum and also pranced mincing some like you was fegelah like Kit Marlowe himself whose play got stole to do this one . <p> " And I 'll wager our good Master Shakepen did near blow wind from his own fundament for sheer rage when I did it thus ! " my Will said , and laughed so he wept tears from his eyes . " So let us to a cask of Rhenish wine , or mayhap a jar of the Hollander 's harsher brew ! Come , Pinky , we 'll have a carouse will make you lose all thought of this poor play we 've played the last this day ! " <p> Which I did n't . I did n't go on a carouse with my Will Kempe that day , because from our common purse I had to take care he did n't squander too much our monies . And also I never forgot what W.S. did me and all Jews , Sephardic and Ashkenazi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> What I say is W.S. was n't no mensch , even if he could write plays brought monies , and my Will Kempe was , and also I was and still am , years gone . Which is why I told this . <p> Footnote
