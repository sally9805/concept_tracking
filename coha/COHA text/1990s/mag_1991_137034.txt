Standing at the Bar of an All-Black VFW post in my hometown of Piedmont , W.Va. , I offered five dollars to anyone who could tell me how many African-American professional athletes were at work today . There are 35 million African-Americans , I said . // " Ten million ! " yelled one intrepid soul , too far into his cups . // " No way ... more like 500,000 , " said another . // " You mean all professional sports , " someone interjected , " including golf and tennis , but not counting the brothers from Puerto Rico ? " Everyone laughed . // " Fifty thousand , minimum , " was another guess . // Here are the facts : // There are 1,200 black professional athletes in the U.S. // There are 12 times more black lawyers than black athletes . // There are 2 ? times more black dentists than black athletes . // There are 15 times more black doctors than black athletes . // Nobody in my local VFW believed these statistics ; in fact , few people would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pages of SPORTS ILLUSTRATED . In spite of these statistics , too many African-American youngsters still believe that they have a much better chance of becoming another Magic Johnson or Michael Jordan than they do of matching the achievements of Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke or neurosurgeon Dr. Benjamin Carson , both of whom , like Johnson and Jordan , are black . // In reality , an African-American youngster has about as much chance of becoming a professional athlete as he or she does of winning the lottery . The tragedy for our people , however , is that few of us accept that truth . // Let me confess that I love sports . Like most black people of my generation  --  I 'm 40  --  I was raised to revere the great black athletic heroes , and I never tired of listening to the stories of triumph and defeat that , for blacks , amount to a collective epic much like those of the ancient Greeks : Joe Louis 's demolition of Max Schmeling ; Satchel Paige 's dazzling repertoire of pitches ; Jesse Owens 's in-your-face performance in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch ; Jackie Robinson 's quiet strength when assaulted by racist taunts ; and a thousand other grand tales . // Nevertheless , the blind pursuit of attainment in sports is having a devastating effect on our people . Imbued with a belief that our principal avenue to fame and profit is through sport , and seduced by a win-at-any-cost system that corrupts even elementary school students , far too many black kids treat basketball courts and football fields as if they were classrooms in an alternative school system . " O.K. , I flunked English , " a young athlete will say . " But I got an A plus in slam-dunking. " // The failure of our public schools to educate athletes is part and parcel of the schools ' failure to educate almost everyone . A recent survey of the Philadelphia school system , for example , stated that " more than half of all students in the third , fifth and eighth grades can not perform minimum math and language tasks . " One in four middle school students in that city fails to pass to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that such statistics are repeated in cities throughout the nation . Young athletes  --  particularly young black athletes-are especially ill-served . Many of them are functionally illiterate , yet they are passed along from year to year for the greater glory of good old Hometown High . We should not be surprised to learn , then , that only 26.6% of black athletes at the collegiate level earn their degrees . For every successful educated black professional athlete , there are thousands of dead and wounded . Yet young blacks continue to aspire to careers as athletes , and it 's no wonder why ; when the University of North Carolina recently commissioned a sculptor to create archetypes of its student body , guess which ethnic group was selected to represent athletes ? // Those relatively few black athletes who do make it in the professional ranks must be prevailed upon to play a significant role in the education of all of our young people , athlete and nonathlete alike . While some have done so , many others have shirked their social obligations : to earmark small percentages of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on television for educational purposes rather than merely to sell sneakers ; to let children know the message that becoming a lawyer , a teacher or a doctor does more good for our people than winning the Super Bowl ; and to form productive liaisons with educators to help forge solutions to the many ills that beset the black community . These are merely a few modest proposals . // A similar burden falls upon successful blacks in all walks of life . Each of us must strive to make our young people understand the realities . Tell them to cheer Bo Jackson but to emulate novelist Toni Morrison or businessman Reginald Lewis or historian John Hope Franklin or Spelman College president Johnetta Cole  --  the list is long . // Of course , society as a whole bears responsibility as well . Until colleges stop using young blacks as cannon fodder in the big-business wars of so-called nonprofessional sports , until training a young black 's mind becomes as important as training his or her body , we will continue to perpetuate a system akin to that of the Roman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mob .
