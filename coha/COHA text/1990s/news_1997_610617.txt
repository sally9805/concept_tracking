<p> Bad news about Washington seemed to multiply this year like potholes after an ice storm . Nonetheless , 1997 was amazing for the sheer volume of civic construction : Any year that includes the completion of buildings or settings as big as the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center , the National Airport extension , the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial and MCI Center can not have been all bad . <p> Furthermore , to a surprising degree , quantity was matched by architectural quality . Yes , there were notable duds . The new home of the Washington Redskins , for instance , is a disappointment  --  Jack Kent Cooke Stadium suffers greatly from its off-center location and a hasty , rather inchoate design . But in general , architectural pluses far outweigh minuses . This is tremendously satisfying . <p> That it all happened in a single year is , of course , coincidental . There was no big Planner in the Sky who ascertained that everything would work out this way . Indeed , the list of projects completed this year is remarkable for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all in a hurry . Some are designed to serve masses of people , some are for a relative few . The federal government played a major role , but so did semi-public agencies , state governments , private investors , philanthropies and institutions . <p> Coincidental as it is , this burst of construction still manages to reflect our current priorities as a society . So , we can be justifiably pleased with the public-spiritedness of much of what got put up this year . At the same time , the relative scarcity of anything that might be called social construction  --  housing for the poor , medical facilities for the needy  --  ought to give us pause . <p> From the perspective of history , the Reagan Building qualifies as the project of the decade , or even , one might argue , of the past half century . At 3.1 million square feet , it is the largest federal office building to be constructed in the Washington area since the Pentagon . More importantly , the building on the south side of Pennsylvania Avenue at 13th Street brings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 embarrassing years of surface parking on what was supposed to be a grand plaza . <p> Nor is this merely a 9-to-5 office complex . Even though political meddling over the years greatly reduced long-planned cultural programs , the huge building retains a healthy , adventurous edge . With restaurants , a food court , international trade facilities and sizable public spaces ( due to open this spring ) , it has the potential to generate new activity in the western part of the old downtown . <p> None of this would matter much had the architect not measured up to the challenge  --  a design failure of this size and prominence would have cast a pall on Pennsylvania Avenue for at least the next half century . However , James Ingo Freed of Pei Cobb Freed &; Partners was more than equal to the task . His design , a sophisticated admixture of the classical with the modern , provides plenty of dramatic punch without upstaging its more traditional neighbors . <p> Freed 's achievement is symptomatic of a nationwide upgrading of federal architecture  --  directed from Washington  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Reagan Building , the benefits of this emphasis on excellence include the new Internal Revenue Service office building ( designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates ) in New Carrollton and the Federal Bureau of Investigation field office ( by Skidmore , Owings &; Merrill ) near Judiciary Square . Each is a welcome improvement in federal workplace standards , each is sharply contemporary in design and each in its way handsomely contributes to a particular architectural context . <p> Yet these important federal buildings are only part of the year 's astonishing crop of boldly scaled new architecture . There are , for instance , the two huge sports complexes  --  Cooke Stadium and MCI Center downtown . Designed by a team of out-of-towners and locals ( Ellerbe Becket of Kansas City with KCF-SHG of Washington ) , the arena tries to be a welcoming place throughout the day in addition to being a good sports venue . And it largely succeeds , although its long-term impact on downtown Washington remains a question . <p> International financial institutions completed two major buildings in 1997 . First came the World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( at 18th Street NW ) , followed by the International Finance Corp . ' s home base on the avenue 's north side ( at 21st Street ) . Both buildings were designed by world-renowned architectural firms  --  Michael Graves for the IFC , Kohn Pedersen Fox for the World Bank . <p> The qualitative results , however , were surprisingly mixed  --  not exactly a Jekyll and Hyde deal , but almost . KPF 's World Bank building puts its best face forward with a dramatically tilted glass wall from top to bottom . By contrast , security requirements and sheer bulk ultimately defeated Graves 's attempts to give human scale to the IFC building . Though attractive at the top , it is at ground level an off-putting fortress for all of its formidable 600-foot length . <p> Regrettably , infrastructure maintenance and improvement almost always get short shrift in government budgets . But while our sewage system is in shaky condition and our bridges and roads need lots of work , our airports are in better shape than ever . Cesar Pelli 's multi-domed extension of National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spacious , efficient , welcoming , even entertaining . William Nicholas Bodouva 's splendid , light-filled new international terminal at Baltimore-Washington International Airport is similarly inspired . <p> This would not be Washington if memorials were not part of the picture . And , as it happens , 1997 was a big year in this field as well . Nearly two decades after it was designed and approved , landscape architect Lawrence Halprin 's memorial to Franklin Delano Roosevelt was dedicated in West Potomac Park  --  an evocative sequence of stone-framed spaces , waterfalls and statues . Also evocative , but with quieter visual poetry , is the Women in Military Service Memorial , designed by architects Marion Weiss and Michael Manfredi to fit in the semi-circular entrance of Arlington National Cemetery . <p> Nor would it be Washington if memorial controversies did not continue to erupt . This year the proposed World War II Memorial was the focus of incendiary debate , after which a competition-winning design by architect Friedrich St. Florian was rejected by two federal reviewing agencies . St. Florian 's design for a column-framed plaza was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves were questionable  --  whether you can fit both a memorial and a narrative explication of that epochal conflict into the central axis of the Mall remains a question . The architect and the memorial 's sponsors are thinking it over , along with the rest of us . <p> Preservation plays a critical role in Washington 's design community and rightfully so  --  saving and recycling our architectural past is among the more meaningful things we can do . Most of the buildings on the D.C. Preservation League 's annual list of Most Endangered Places remain endangered  --  the old downtown , for example , and the Anacostia Historic District  --  but the year saw its share of preservation triumphs . The total rejuvenation of the Jewish Community Center on 16th Street was one ; the sparkling expansion of the Studio Theatre in its old automobile showroom on 14th Street another ; and the renovation of Alexandria 's little Union Station a notable third . <p> Throughout this year , private agencies scrambled to make up for spending cuts on social programs at all levels of government ; surely they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain pressing and public money continues to dry up . But the design professions are responding with pro-bono efforts , and the architectural results ( both for volunteered and paid-for design services ) can be creative and heartwarming . A spirited example is the house-like headquarters in Tenleytown for the Iona Senior Services Center , created by the Weihe Design Group ; another is the excellent N Street Village complex for homeless women , designed by Shalom Baranes Associates for Luther Place Memorial Church . <p> As in the past , much of the Washington area 's freshest , most inventive architecture takes place on a smaller scale  --  residential additions , office lobbies , retail interiors . The husband-and-wife design team of Theodore Adamstein and Olvia Demetriou , for instance , continues its brilliant restaurant work with the striking interior of Raku : An Asian Diner in Bethesda . On a larger scale , KressCox Associates demonstrates how fitting in and standing out need not be contradictory in a sweet addition for the Washington Theological Union . And then there is the tried-and-true : Hartman-Cox came through with yet another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Georgetown University Law Center . <p> All things considered , we can consider ourselves lucky . The amount of good work that got done in 1997 is not likely to be repeated anytime soon .
