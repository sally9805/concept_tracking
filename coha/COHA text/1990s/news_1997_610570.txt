<p> Frank Lloyd Wright holds a special place in the history of House Beautiful magazine . An 1896 book by the master architect/designer titled " The House Beautiful " provided direct inspiration for the glossy periodical , which began publishing in November of that year . And Wright 's conviction that home is not just where we live but how we live is credited as being a continuing source of inspiration . In a celebration of its centennial , the magazine has co- sponsored , with Chrysler-Plymouth , a three-year traveling exhibit including photos of Wright 's work plus drawings , furniture and decorative objects . It will be at the Washington Design Center April 24-30 before wrapping up later this year . <p> 300 D. St. SW .
