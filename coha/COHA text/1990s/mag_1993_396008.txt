Ottway , Tobin &; Poole 1400 K Street , NW Washington , D.C. 20005 2 April , 1993 John R. Hanes Managing Director The Potomac Companies 16A Old Dominion Boulevard Alexandria , Virginia 22305 Dear Jack , Do n't be put off by the odds against the proposition . I know that Saddam Hussein is n't a man whom it 's easy to like , but then neither is George Steinbrenner or Mickey Kantor . Neither was Ferdinand Marcos or the Shah of Iran . You and I both know that if we were to choose our clients for their wit or high moral character , we would be playing racquetball in Memphis instead of golf at Burning Tree . Judging by what I understood you to say last night at Betsy 's dinner party , you 've preserved your access to the regime in Iraq ( specifically to Abu Nawas at the Ministry of Culture and Information ) , and I think that we can turn the connection to our mutual advantage . As I tried to say before we were interrupted by the basketball game , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work of refitting Hussein 's image for an affectionate welcome to the pages of Newsweek and a respectful line of questioning on Prime Time Live . Eventually the Clinton Administration will want something from the man ( most probably a military alliance against the prospect of Muslim jihad emanating from Iran ) , but the President will not want to feel that he is talking to a thug , much less to a psychopathic killer , a lunatic , or a cheap impersonation of Adolf Hitler . The President likes to hug people , and to the degree that we make Hussein huggable , we bring him that much nearer to a joint press conference in the White House Rose Garden . This morning I spoke to my associates about the publicity campaign , and they thought that the money is apt to be quite large . Hill and Knowlton billed Citizens for a Free Kuwait $12 million for the promotion of the Persian Gulf War , and none of us can think of a good reason why Hussein would n't pay at least twice as much to redeem his image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Iraq continues to lose on its diminished oil trade , any fee paid to Washington lobbyists , even to a firm as greedy as Ron Brown 's , amounts to a pittance . As a preliminary indication of the new administration 's attitude toward Iraq , I enclose a transcript of Warren Christopher 's remarks last Sunday on Face the Nation . You will see that Christopher expressly avoids saying that Hussein must be removed from power before the United Nations rescinds its trade embargo against Iraq . As I 'm sure you remember ( in part because Potomac Companies expedited so many of the grain credits and transfers of nuclear technology to Iraq ) , the Bush Administration pursued a policy of blind revenge , never missing a chance to insist that Hussein be driven into the desert before it would agree to suspend the course of punishment . Notice that Christopher speaks instead of " de-personalizing " the quarrel with Iraq , and in that lawyer 's term of art we begin to hear the softer voice of compromise and accommodation . The same shading of emphasis showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York Times dispatch from the United Nations . The Security Council reviewed the question of its sanctions against Iraq , but neither the American nor the British ambassador took the trouble to mention Hussein 's departure as a condition of any happy return to the arrangements in place prior to the Gulf War . Their silence can be understood as another straw in the warm wind of multicultural good feeling . Think of Hussein as representative of a small but often maligned minority ( i.e. , Arab despots ) , and you can almost imagine a university professor named to a chair in late twentieth-century West Asian barbarism . You said that you expected to see Abu Nawas later this month in Zurich , and if you show him the television transcript and the newspaper report ( copy also enclosed ) , he might be persuaded to listen to a proposal . I know that at this point what we are talking about seems unlikely , but the mass media these days shift the geopolitical scenery with truly marvelous ease , and you might tell Nawas that the accelerating rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geared to the production values of MTV and CNN . Governments come and go between commercials , and enemies become friends ( or friends , enemies ) in sudden gusts of newsprint . You of all people do n't need to be reminded that when Boris Yeltsin came to the United States in the spring of 1991 the Washington press corps dismissed him as a boorish peasant , clumsy and frequently drunk , by no means a statesman capable of succeeding the still heroic Mikhail Gorbachev . If I remember the occasion correctly , you were one of the people assigned to conduct Yeltsin from Washington to the Council on Foreign Relations in New York , and you left him temporarily alone in the bar of the Plaza Hotel . Two months later Yeltsin found himself proclaimed a tribune of the people by crowds of newborn democrats cheering in the streets of Moscow , and the American news media hastily corrected the official portrait to show less of the resemblance to a drunken peasant and more of the likeness to Thomas Jefferson . You might also remind Nawas that over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arab clients have been so numerous that he should take comfort in a close reading of the historical record . Anwar Sadat persuaded four American presidents that he embodied their last , best hope against whatever it was that they most feared in the Middle East . He was also a shrewd military dictator who imprisoned and eliminated as many of his enemies as he thought necessary to the peace of God . During World War II he collaborated with the Nazis against the British , but when he was assassinated in 1981 his eulogists , among them Presidents Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford , remarked on his admiration for Mahatma Gandhi , and Time magazine mourned the death of one of the " miracles of creation , " " a very great man " as immortal as the Pyramids . Similar transformations ( although by no means as dramatic or complete ) reconstituted the images of Yasir Arafat , the Palestinian leader , and Hafez al-Assad , the president of Syria once known as the Beast of Damascus . We both remember Arafat as a sullen terrorist ordering the random @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has become a cheerful statesman entrusted with the hope of defining the terms of endearment between the Israeli and Palestinian diasporas . Assad governs Syria as if it were a prison , but he took the American side in the Gulf War and so joined the company of heroes assembled in the desert under the banners of freedom . As a candidate for America 's affection , Hussein is nobody 's favorite , and I do n't pretend that he 's a nice guy . Hussein is as cruel as he is deluded , and since he seized power in 1979 he has arranged to kill or maim ( in foreign wars or at the pleasure of his secret police ) probably as many as 500,000 Iraqis . We both have been to Baghdad and seen the grotesque war memorials and the billboard photographs of Hussein in nearly every street ( Hussein as noble warrior , Hussein as the figure of justice , Hussein as desert prince , etc. ) , and we should say to Nawas at the outset that what we mean to undertake is no small thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an invitation to the White House and presenting him to the news media . My own firm will furnish access to the President . Two of the new senior partners , both of them hired within a week of the November election , knew Clinton at Oxford . They think it likely that the President will admire Hussein 's endurance and tenacity . As you know , Clinton endured the blitzkrieg of last year 's election campaign with a doggedness that prompted at least one columnist ( in the Washington Times ) to compare him favorably to a rhinoceros . I 'm not suggesting that we draw too strict a parallel between the barrage of questions about Gennifer Flowers and the bombing of Baghdad , but in Hussein 's capacity for survival Clinton may recognize a kindred virtue or talent . Nor does the President like to deny anybody admission to his presence , and he has a weakness for people in whom he can find the story of an abused inner child . If criminal pathology is the proof of early sorrow , I 'm sure that we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more eloquent language of personal grievance : born in the dust of the late British empire , abandoned by his father , reared in poverty by an ignorant and superstitious mother , denied the right to a university education , oppressed by Shiites , scorned for his dream of pan-Arabism , a member in good standing of perhaps the world 's largest and most oppressed majority  --  i.e. , the historically challenged . I do n't know if Hussein plays a musical instrument or performs card tricks , but anything in the way of a domestic virtue , even a recipe for rice pilaf that could be confided to Julia Child or the Frugal Gourmet , would enhance his value to Larry King and the afternoon talk shows . American opinion insists on the fiction that the relations between states belong to the same category of feeling and behavior that governs relations between individuals . It is n't that the United States wo n't do business with tyrants but rather that the United States first must persuade itself of the tyrant 's innate goodness . The ally of a well-meaning democracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news media we explain that Hussein has come to make confession  --  to a joint session of Congress , to the pro-Israel lobby , to the editors of The New Republic . He has come to say he 's sorry , and his manner should be as humble as it is contrite . What 's done is done , and it 's no good trying to pretend otherwise . The invasion of Kuwait was a mistake , a public-relations blunder , a moment 's carelessness , an error of judgment . Bombing Tel Aviv was even more foolish . Certainly Hussein would never make the same mistakes again . But having made the mistakes , he has learned an invaluable lesson . He 's a better and wiser man because he has learned  --  not without suffering  --  to recognize and respect human desires distinctly different from his own . I have enclosed a number of draft statements along these lines ( the kind of document that we prepare for those of our clients going before one or another of the Senate committees to explain one or another of their conflicts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nawas merely as suggestions and talking points . Hussein need not commit the statements to memory , but he must accept a full measure of blame . His confession ends on the great American theme of blaming events ( the destruction of Baghdad , the massacre of the Kurds ) on somebody else . He put his faith in the wrong State Department officials . He was poorly served with bad advice . It was dark . He did n't know what he was doing . Only if it is understood that he was a victim of circumstance will it be possible to forgive his sins and excuse his crimes . As I said to you last night , the media campaign will present a number of difficulties , and I doubt that we 'll ever fully persuade William Safire or A. M. Rosenthal of Hussein 's change of heart . But the fees should prove substantial , and I think that we might be pleasantly surprised by the receptiveness of the White House and the State Department . The President believes in inclusiveness . He does n't like to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a stomach for confrontation . Because he already has abandoned so many of his fortified ideological positions , the Congress has marked him as a man afraid of bullies , and , as you know better than I , Hussein knows how to bully people . Tell Nawas that we can imagine Hussein posing in an advertisement for an Armani suit or a Rolex watch . Handsome Saddam Hussein , his uniforms tailored in Italy and his photographs retouched to bring forward the likeness to Omar Sharif . Stalwart Saddam Hussein , his youth and early sorrows as an indigent terrorist overlaid with the same romantic glaze that made of Oliver North 's criminal escapades a proof of his patriotism . Debonair Saddam Hussein seen gliding with the other celebrities through the pages of Vanity Fair , chatting with Henry Kissinger and Oscar de la Renta , applauding the polo matches in Palm Beach .
