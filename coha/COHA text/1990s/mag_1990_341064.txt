BUT HAS HE WATCHED REDS ? Remember Zhao Ziyang , former general secretary of China 's Communist Party ? He was last seen in public on May 19 , 1989 , during a tearful meeting with student hunger strikers in Tiananmen Square . Then came the crackdown and Zhao 's expulsion from the party . Friends now report that Zhao is at peace with his current situation . Small wonder . He may have lost his chauffeured Mercedes 500 , but he still has a staff of five aides and an assigned Nissan that comes with , yes , a mini-bar . Zhao seldom leaves his house , spending most of his days reading and watching videotapes . One acquaintance quotes the ex-leader : " I did n't realize so many good movies existed . "
