As the wise-guy anchor of Weekend Update for six years on Saturday Night Live , Dennis Miller came across as a smug , overage frat boy . Now , sporting a full beard and a fresh dose of righteous zeal , he 's the angry prophet of the airwaves  --  Howard Beale with a bottle of Evian . On his new late-night HBO show , Miller delivers well-tuned rants on topics like the cult of celebrity . " Michael Jackson , " he fumes , " one of the five weirdest people on the planet earth  --  and the other four are his brothers . And while we 're on the subject , why do I even know Tito Jackson 's name , for Christ 's sake ? . . . The irony of Andy Warhol 's statement is that many of our present-day celebrities ca n't even fill the 15 , folks . And we do n't seem to mind . " <P> Bill Maher , by contrast , has folksy good looks and a silky , matter-of-fact delivery that owes more to Jack Benny than to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humor in the GATT talks and China 's most-favored- nation trading status ? That 's just what Maher does on Politically Incorrect , his Comedy Central show that features the most eclectic political round tables on TV . Maher has mediated between Harvey Fierstein and ex-Mayor of Washington Marion Barry ; brought Martin Short together with Jimmy Breslin ; made Tom Hayden lighten up and Corbin Bernsen look smart . All without causing the viewer to feel like a sleaze for watching . <P> In an era when most comedians are too cool to care , here 's an odd twist : the two best stand-up comics on TV are the ones who have ventured most boldly into the political arena . Not the easy-to-take , nonpartisan " topicality " of Leno and Letterman , but informed , savvy , opinionated comedy about real issues . Miller and Maher are helping stand-up comedy escape from its contemporary cul- de-sac , where Jerry Seinfeld clones obsess about sex , TV and life 's little annoyances . These two comics read the whole newspaper  --  not just the funny clippings their writers collect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the midst of a six-week run on HBO ( and will return later this year ) , has had a few rocky moments but many more stimulating ones . He opens each half-hour with quips about the week 's news , then brings on a guest to discuss a specially chosen topic : Senator Bill Bradley on crime , say . As in his short-lived 1992 talk show , Miller brings more to interviews than just his cue cards . " I admire you as a politician , " he told Bradley , " for the same reason I admired you in the N.B.A. : you seem to play well without the ball . " <P> Miller 's monologues teem with outre literary and pop-culture references , but he apportions them cannily . The Brady Bill , he scoffs , is a weak crime- fighting gesture : " A five-day waiting period to get a handgun  --  you have to get on a longer waiting list than that to buy Aladdin at Blockbuster . " And his jeremiads are filled with two-dollar words that actually add up . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of holes , " he complains . " We have become a country of ragged recidivists dedicated to the proposition that all parents are created equally bad and the progeny-slash- progenitor dynamic should be the landfill for all our personal shortcomings . . . "
