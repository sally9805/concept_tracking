<p> Lance Gentile , the physician responsible for making sure NBC 's hot new medical drama " ER " stays true to medicine , watched the show last week with his parents , and  --  would n't you know it ?  --  everybody 's a critic . <p> " My mother says , of all the things she can say , ' Would the nurses let their hair loose like that during surgical procedures ? ' I 'm like , Mom , I 'm going to kill you . That 's the only thing you can say ? I 'm doing a bad job as a technical adviser ? " <p> As a doctor specializing in emergency medicine , Gentile is supposed to keep the stories realistic . But as a writer on the show  --  which he also is  --  he understands the need to balance realism with the dramatic requirements of prime-time entertainment . His counterpart at CBS 's new " Chicago Hope , " Linda Klein , a registered nurse with a background in open-heart surgery , must do the same . Both shows air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ratings at 9 on Channel 9 , and " ER , " an instant hit  --  last week it was No. 4 in the ratings  --  at 10 on Channel 4 . <p> As a result of their work on the shows , Gentile and Klein are hearing from a lot of their colleagues . Klein got a call from an operating room nurse , appalled that no one on " Chicago Hope " was wearing goggles during surgery to prevent any blood  --  which could carry the AIDS virus  --  from spraying their eyes . Now some of the actors do . <p> When an " ER " surgeon made " an offhand comment " about the radiologists being " idiots , " Gentile says , he heard from the president of the American College of Radiologists . When the residents worked double shifts  --  as they did in the " ER " pilot but have n't in the ongoing series , Gentile is quick to point out  --  he heard from lots of emergency medicine physicians , who reminded him that residents are now limited to one 12-hour shift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little uptight ? <p> " A little ? " he says and stops cold , unwilling to go on . <p> Ask a few doctors about these shows and you 're likely to hear a few common complaints . <p> For one thing , some of them say the patients on the shows look too healthy . " I 've taken care of a lot of people with cardiac arrests , " says David Sklar , president of the Society of Academic Emergency Medicine and chairman of the Department of Emergency Medicine at the University of New Mexico , " and I never had anyone come back joking . They do n't generally get up and start cracking jokes , " as one resuscitated patient did on " ER . " <p> As for " Chicago Hope , " which last week featured a baby in need of a heart transplant , Sklar says the decision-making would never be left to one doctor . " Most hospitals have an ethics committee to help the physicians and the family . ... They trivialized the enormous amount of energy that goes into trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was an improbable situation  --  the story reached its climax when a perfectly matched donor appeared in the hospital at just the right moment  --  but she says that is the " constant battle . ... Dramatically it works , and it plays , so what are you going to do ? You bring up these points and they are valid points , and the writers do with it what they want to do with it . That 's where the entertainment part comes in . " <p> For another thing , some doctors object to the way the TV doctors deal with their patients ' families . On " ER " last week a cardiac patient was told that without a heart transplant he would not live through the night . When Dr. Greene ( Anthony Edwards ) was asked by the man 's young daughter whether it was true that her daddy was going to die that night , he simply said , " Yes , he is . " <p> " No way ! " says David Milzman , an attending physician at the Georgetown University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emergency rooms are n't even called that anymore , everyone points out  --  they are emergency departments ) . " No way ! Even the coldest , most ruthless doctor would n't do that . " <p> In addition , says Milzman , " no medical student would ever touch a patient " as the med student in " ER " is allowed to do . Milzman worries that after seeing the show , the public will be concerned about the kind of care available in emergency departments . <p> " That 's what they tell the public , " responds Gentile . " Med students never do anything  --  that 's total bull . ... I was a medical student once and we did all that stuff . ... They do n't want to say that because they do n't want people to be afraid to go to emergency rooms . " <p> Art Sanders , a past president of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine and a professor of emergency medicine at the University of Arizona , voices another common complaint . Though he acknowledges that he has n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he says , " I do n't ever see attendings , " referring to doctors who have already completed their training and are board certified in emergency medicine , a specialty since 1980 . " That might have been the way it was when Michael Crichton went to medical school but that 's not the way it is now . " Crichton , the best-selling author who is also a physician , created the series and is one of the executive producers . <p> Gentile says the show 's writers " elected that this is a show about residents , " adding that the attendings are there but " they 're shadows . " Still , he thinks that based on what they see , viewers should feel confident about emergency rooms . " These doctors are brilliant . They know everything . They always save the patient . ... They do n't care about money . They do n't care about Mercedeses . " <p> Gentile , who graduated from medical school in the ' 70s and film school in the ' 90s , acknowledges that some things in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  medication that might take two minutes to work in reality , he says , will work in two seconds . " If we waited around for two minutes , " he says , " we 've got the death of drama . " <p> " Chicago Hope " is much more graphic than " ER , " with a cardiac surgeon who will crack open a chest at the drop of a hat , and so Klein has frequent calls to help bring those medical moments alive without really showing somebody being cut open . When a scalpel is cutting , it 's cutting pigskin . Star Mandy Patinkin practiced his sewing for a week , she says , so he could do stitches . <p> Blood is a sticky concoction of corn syrup and dye called Reel Blood . Animal intestines and pig hearts are used for surgical scenes . During the shooting of the pilot a freezer holding a number of those hearts inadvertently got turned off over the weekend , resulting in quite a stench on the set Monday morning . Not only that , the hearts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them all in bleach . To everyone 's amazement , it killed the odor and restored the color . <p> Klein , who has been a technical adviser to medical shows for 14 years  --  her last assignment was " Doogie Howser , M.D. "  --  says she successfully talked " Chicago Hope " writers out of having doctors show up at a scrub sink in their street clothes  --  it would just never happen . On the other hand , sometimes actors do n't wear masks when the doctors they are playing would , and there dramatic reality takes precedence : When they wear masks , nobody can see their faces . <p> To help keep the show accurate , Gentile says , he and a couple researchers talk to doctors around the country , collecting real episodes from real emergency rooms  --  ranging from the bizarre to the horrific . On the bizarre side , for example , one doctor told the story of a patient who had been pronounced dead who sat up and burped . On the horrific , a man whose girlfriend left him set himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a medical situation , Gentile produces a summary of how it would be handled in an emergency room . He checks the scripts for accuracy , and when shooting begins he arranges for a number of practicing emergency room nurses to participate in the scenes ; the same thing happens on " Chicago Hope . " After shooting is complete , Gentile says , some appropriate medical dialogue is often added and some shots are removed if they show a procedure being done inaccurately . <p> Still , he is more than realistic about the line he is walking . Yes , he reassured his mom that the nurses ' hair might in fact be hanging loose in an emergency room , but not in an operating room . And both he and Klein know their shows will not succeed if they become dry medical documentaries . <p> " Look , " Gentile says , laughing , " it 's entertainment . It 's not brain surgery . "
