Section : TECHNOLOGY/1997 EARNINGS FORECASTS Good software , hardware and chip companies trade at very steep multiples of expected 1997 earnings . Which ones are worth it ? <p> THEM THAT HAS , GETS . Simply put , that 's the economic theory of increasing returns . It says that a slight market share advantage one year can magnify into a huge advantage a few years later . It goes a long way toward explaining some of the dizzying multiples on computer stocks . <p> You do n't see increasing returns in wallboard or auto rentals . In those businesses , economies of scale go only so far . As a result , being number one does n't confer any powerful advantage ; a smaller supplier could underprice the leader , grow faster , even earn more money . But the phenomenon of increasing returns is very evident in the computer business . There , a 51% share may soon evolve into a 90% share , a number two position become worthless . <p> About 15 years ago the Microsoft-Intel standard in desktop computing began to outsell the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Apple Computer ( see cover story ) , the Microsoft-Intel axis is close to being a monopoly . <p> Why is the computer business like this ? You can call it the bandwagon effect . " There 's an innate desire in computer users to be part of the mainstream , " says Roger McNamee , a technology investor with Integral Capital Partners in Menlo Park , Calif . " They 're afraid of making a technology mistake . " Who wants to own a computer that runs CP/M ? That early competitor to Microsoft 's DOS is just a relic now . <p> Take a look at the " operating margin " column in our earnings forecast tables . This is the ratio of operating income ( net before depreciation , interest and taxes ) to revenues . A high number usually indicates pricing power . No one can consistently earn a 40% operating margin from a building supplies business . If you charge too much for your wallboard , customers buy elsewhere . <p> Switching software suppliers is not so easy . There may or may not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which customers have invested so much in compatible hardware , compatible software and training . And there is no better exhibit of economies of scale than the software business . Once a company has spent $100 million to develop a program , it can make additional copies for pennies . <p> The lucky handful of companies benefiting from increasing returns in computer-related ventures boast market capitalizations more than double-in Cisco Systems ' case , more than triple-those of their nearest competitors . Microsoft hogs desktop software ( see table , p. 318 ) . Netscape hogs Internet software ( see table above ) . Intel hogs the microprocessor sector ( see table , p. 320 ) . <p> Market leaders like these are worth a premium . But how much ? Wall Street expects Microsoft 's earnings per share to grow 21% per year over its next two fiscal years . This would put fiscal 1998 earnings at $4.99 . Microsoft is trading at 30 times that sum . Expensive ? Since 1926 stocks have traded at an average of 13 times their reported earnings . Today 's buyers of Microsoft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep up a 21% earnings growth until 2002 , and thereafter maintain a market-tracking growth . <p> Two things could trip up investors who bet on technology leaders . One is that the desktop computer business could go into a recession . There has n't been one recently , but who 's to say when computer buyers will tire of the upgrade treadmill ? Microsoft 's Office 97 is bloated with unnecessary features like help from an animated spaceship or a cartoonlike Albert Einstein ; you need an oversexed PC to go with it . It 's hard to remember now , but even that paragon of operating margins , Intel , was in the red for a while ( in the mid-1980s ) . <p> The other risk is that a shift in technology could transfer power away from the leader . IBM was once all-powerful in computers . Then the microcomputer displaced the mainframe . For a while last year there were those who thought Netscape could topple Microsoft from its operating system bastion . Cisco Systems pretty much owns the router business it invented , but its technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boxes called switches ( FORBES , July 29 ) . That risk may not yet be reflected in Cisco 's market value of $42 billion , which is 10 times revenues and 31 times expected fiscal 1997 earnings . <p> Bulls love Netscape 's 80% of the Web browser market , dominance in Web server software and 76% projected earnings-per-share growth through 1998 . But is this stock worth 108 times projected 1997 earnings ? In a recent report Morgan Stanley software analyst Mary Meeker strived to rationalize Netscape 's price . In her model the stock could climb to 67 , up 13% from the current price , if one assumes that by 1999 the company has enjoyed revenue growth of 70% annually , sports an 18% net margin ( more than double the current ) and trades at a multiple of 35 times earnings . Talk about bullish assumptions . <p> In contrast , Intel looks downright cheap at 16 times expected 1997 earnings . Scott Randall , an analyst at SoundView Financial Group in Stamford , Conn. , predicts that weak pricing ( especially in memory chips ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7% next year . Intel 's dominance in processor chips will see it past that weakness , says Randall . He also likes niche players in analog chips such as Linear Technology and Analog Devices . A lack of skilled analog chip designers will limit competition here . <p> Computer service companies , often overlooked in the buzz about Internet browsers and PCs , deserve serious consideration ( see table ) . Buyer power is consolidating into the hands of a few service outfits like EDS , IBM Global Services , Computer Sciences Corp . and privately held Andersen Consulting . <p> " Microsoft and Oracle are no longer at the top of the food chain , " declares Robert Djurdjevic , president of technology consulting firm Annex Research in Phoenix , Ariz . " EDS and IBM Global Services have more market power than any single software or hardware supplier . " In his view , EDS ' multiple of 19 times expected earnings makes it a bargain . <p> Internet <p> Netscape , whose shares are down 16% in 1996 , avoided the severe crash of Internet software stocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardware makers .
