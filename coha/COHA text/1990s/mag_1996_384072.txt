No ski area in the East can out-terrain Sugarloaf/USA . It 's got it all : great cruising ; dead-to-the-fall-line bump runs ; narrow , squiggly trails in the grand old New England tradition ; first-rate beginner terrain ; and , an unusual bonus for an Eastern resort , above-tree-line skiing . Furthermore , there 's a neatly organized base village surrounded by the stark beauty of the Maine wilderness , making Sugarloaf - Looking out over the Maine something that 's rare in New wilderness from the snowfields . England-a true destination resort . For my money , this is skiing as good as it gets in the East . Given the quality of the terrain , then , you can appreciate the enviable quandary in which Sugarloaf higher-ups have found themselves in recent years . How do you make a top-notch ski area better ? The answer is to acknowledge your shortcomings and do what you can to fix them . Sugarloaf 's principal drawback was a lift system that was beginning to show its age . In the era of highspeed quads , it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lift lines and ride two slow double chairs in order to access the area 's main terrain . On busy weekends in the past , I 'd find myself mired for as many as 40 minutes just getting from the base of the ski area to the top of the Spillway chair , where the best of Sugarloaf 's skiing begins . There had to be a better way . Warren Cook , Sugarloaf 's general manager , had been contemplating the installation of a faster lift , but it was n't until the ' ' 94  --  ' ' 95 season that , with the backing of S-K-I ( the corporation that owned Killington and other areas ) , he pulled together the financial wherewithal to make it happen . Some additional smarts went into reconfiguring Sugarloaf 's trails : To make room for the increased skier traffic caused by the new SuperQuad lift , two cruising runs , Hayburner and King 's Landing , were cut . It all made good sense , but understand one thing : No change at Sugarloaf , no matter how sensible , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following arguably more loyal than at any ski area in the East . Sugarloaf regulars-the diehard weekenders who have been making the trek up from Boston and Portland for years-regard the area as if it were a family heirloom . Their reaction to any kind of change is apt to be skepticism . Why change a good thing ? As a result , I expected to encounter some grumpiness when I visited the area shortly after the lift opened . Not so . As Chip Carey , Sugarloaf 's vice president for marketing and sales explains , " It was two slow chairs versus one high-speed quad . We were universally applauded . " What surprised me , too , was that Sugarloaf skiers really liked the faster lift and the new terrain . " We love the padded chairs ! " a couple of Sugarloaf regulars said to me happily-exposing a soft side that seemed to run counter to the kind of old-fashioned , tough-it-out Yankee grit I 'd always encountered in the past at Sugarloaf . What Sugarloafers also seemed to appreciate in the new lift-and-trail scheme was what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spillway to stay the same , " says Carey , " and they were concerned that we were going to mess around with Double Bitter . " To change two of Sugarloaf 's most popular trails  --  the bumped-up Spillway and the twisty-turny Double Bitter-would have been heresy in the eyes of Sugarloaf worshipers . The fact is , though , that those two trails probably ski better now . The two newly cut trails siphon off much of the skier traffic that might otherwise have headed Double Bitter 's way . And with fewer skiers riding the Spillway double chairs , fewer skiers are skiing the Spillway trail . While Sugarloaf s management was universally applauded for the new lift , it received mixed reactions on another major change . Depending on whom you talk to , the decision to install snowmaking on the snowfields five years ago was either smart , shortsighted , or inconsequential . My feeling is the snowmaking on the snowfields has probably done more to improve Sugarloaf 's image than it has the skiing . I can sympathize with the dilemma the Sugarloaf marketing team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so openly exposed to wind , sun , and rime made snowfield skiing a crapshoot . If Sugarloaf was going to be able to assure vacationers that the snowfields were skiable , snowmaking was essential . The plan has worked ; last year , the snowfields were opened shortly after Thanksgiving and remained open through the season . Yet in my two visits to Sugarloaf last season , I remained unconvinced that snowmaking has improved the snowfields . When the wind comes up , wrapping around the summit , it can polish the manmade snow . In that case , I 'd prefer to ski the wonderfully wind-protected terrain of the new high-speed quad . When the wind blows the snow off the summit , that snow has to go somewhere , and mostly it gets sifted into the trees lower down . The renegade regulars at Sugarloaf have been taking advantage of this for years by sneaking off-trail into some of the best tree shots in the East or anywhere . So , two years ago , Sugarloaf finally caved in and opened up the entire mountain within the ski-area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a decision akin to decriminalizing marijuana : pretty much anyone who wanted to do it was doing it anyway . But the new policy did give Sugarloaf a chance to tout , in its Boundary to Boundary promotional campaign , an asset that is , in my opinion , a bigger deal than the snowfields . As Carey says , " It 's freedom . Go where you want and do what you want . " Sugarloaf has also thinned out 11 gladed areas , making the off-trail skiing more accessible . // sugarloaf / usa , maine // A couple of issues still need to be addressed . One is to upgrade access to the snowfields ; when conditions are right , the one summit lift-an antiquated gondola-does n't cut it . There are plans to install a high-speed quad to the summit , but scheduling remains indefinite . A more-pressing need is beds . There is a snazzy slopeside hotel and a couple perfectly comfortable inns , but many of Sugarloaf 's 8,000 beds are in private homes and condos , not in the vacationrental pool . And because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is essential . With the nearest major city , Portland , about 2 1/2 hours away , day skiing is not a realistic option . As I discovered last spring , finding a bed at all , much less one at a reasonable price , can be a real challenge on a busy weekend . Sure , there are a few motels and bed-andbreakfasts off-campus , but on the edge of the Maine wilderness - where Sugarloaf lies , they are few and far between . You can stay at the funky old Herbert Hotel in the equally funky town of Kingfield and soak in a little deep-woods Maine character . But then you have to drive 18 miles to the ski area . Management knows this is an area that needs to be addressed ; more beds ( including a new hotel ) are part of the long-range plan . How the plan ends up being fleshed out remains to be seen . The American Skiing Company just gained full ownership of Sugarloaf . Will ASC 's man in charge , Les Otten , who likes to move quickly , be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What we do know , however , is what has already transpired : the installation of the high-speed lift , the added snowmaking , the tree-skiing policy . All of which has made a first-rate area even better <p>
