As architects began rediscovering the virtues of color and history and whimsy a decade ago , the buildings that resulted were often derided as cartoonish exercises in kitschy nostalgia . Disneyesque became a standard pejorative applied to the work of such post-Modernists as Michael Graves and Robert A.M. Stern . Now , rather suddenly , the figure of speech is biting back : under chairman Michael Eisner , Disney has become the premiere patron of architecture of the late 20th century , commissioning major works by a majority of the world 's most celebrated architects . <P> Disneyites occupy a zany new Neoclassical corporate headquarters that Graves designed in Burbank , Calif. ( the Seven Dwarfs , each cast 19 ft. tall in concrete , support the pediment ) . In December the first guests checked into Stern 's two **26;10895;TOOLONG hotels at Disney World in Lake Buena Vista , outside Orlando . May marked the opening of the most interesting of the Disney architecture , an administration building in Lake Buena Vista by Arata Isozaki . And at Euro Disney outside Paris , where a $4.1 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed by Graves , Stern , Frank Gehry and Antoine Predock are all under construction . <P> Eisner 's rationale for hiring practically every famous architect on earth is complicated : part corporate imagemaking , part personal enthusiasm and part a natural extension of the new Disney self-confident show-biz relentlessness . And there is some enlightened despotism thrown in . " It costs the same to do well as badly , " Eisner claims . " It 's exactly the same price if you build 1,200 ugly rooms . " <P> Shortly after arriving at Disney in 1984 , Eisner had his first working dinner with some of the company 's executives and offhandedly suggested they build a hotel in the shape of Mickey Mouse . They were shocked  --  and galvanized . But some of the Old Guard was not amused . Ground had already been broken at Epcot for a new hotel complex , and Disney 's partner in the project was determined to hire a conventional architect to create a conventionally upscale hotel  --  a meretricious riot of Trumpian brass and glass . Eisner , however , wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , to design the 758-room Swan and the 1,514-room Dolphin . " I said , ' Look , we 're an entertainment company . ' " Eisner got his architect , and the Disney adventure in big-time , high-profile design had begun . <P> " We 're Disney . We 've got to have the biggest , the best , the most tasteful , " says Eisner . Most tasteful is a new Disney superlative , yet taste and aesthetic surprise and a certain rigor are what make the recent architectural fantasies more than Vegas kitsch or shopping-mall saccharine . <P> * Disney has a reputation among architects ( as among filmmakers ) for tightfistedness and micromanagement . On each project Eisner is brought in five times to review the plans , approving masonry textures , paint colors and light fixtures . One reason the chairman says he meddles more in the design of a hotel than he does , for instance , in the production of The Marrying Man is that " movies go away , but buildings stand as monuments to your bad taste . " Plus he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how to make creative people see that something is not as good as they can do . Or I tell architects , ' Do n't give up . Do n't accommodate . ' "
