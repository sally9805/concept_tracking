<p> THE Lamola family believes that the road to the new South Africa is going to be long and painful . <p> " If you can put yourself in the position of a struggling person , you will see that negotiations do n't mean very much , " says Silas Lamola , a pensive man whose commitment to his community is even more important than goals for himself and his family . " I have n't seen any major changes in the way we live , " he says . <p> Mr. Lamola 's quiet skepticism is founded in personal experience . His mood contrasts sharply with the expectation and hope among middle-class blacks . <p> If the main dynamic in South Africa is a conflict between the old and the new - between the hierarchy and tradition of the tribe and the new values of urbanization and Western-style democracy - the Lamolas are caught somewhere in the middle . <p> Lamola says that it will take generations to correct the distortions created by apartheid . He is convinced that strife and upheaval are as inevitable as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . <p> " We can not lead a normal life under such conditions , " says Lamola , pointing to the lack of facilities . " We first have to build the community . " <p> Silas Lamola plays a special role in his community . He says he believes in God , but then proceeds in a passionate explanation of the importance of tribal " ancestor worship " and the central role that communicating with the ancestors plays in his decisionmaking . Perhaps because of his respect for and understanding of his ancestors , Silas is regarded as a natural mediator in the community . <p> With black-on-black violence raging , the only constant factors in the Lamolas lives are " the community " and their smiling daughter Trudy , who reflects the boundless energy of childhood . <p> Silas , Emily , and 7-year-old Trudy live in a wood-and-iron shack in this sprawling community of 30,000 about 25 miles south of Johannesburg . In the center of their tiny living room is the cabinet of a 1950s hi-fi set that is used as a storage cupboard . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no windows , so as soon as the front door is closed ( which is essential to keep the dust out ) the house is in darkness . Inside the shack , the walls are covered with newspapers to keep the dust and wind out and the warmth in . <p> In 1987 , the Lamolas lived in Weiler 's Farm , a rapidly growing squatter settlement about three or four miles from here . Emily Lamola , a dignified woman with a deep reserve of inner confidence , taught at the nursery school . Silas was a community activist at the forefront of the campaign to resist forced relocation by the government to Orange Farm . The community was unified in resisting continual demolitions , evictions , and arrests . <p> Because of his activist role , harassment by the authorities forced Silas to move to Orange Farm in early 1989 . " Fellow activists told me that , if I came here , I would be on my own , " says Lamola . " But I felt I had to come here for my safety . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and visits it at least once a week when he attends meetings of the old residents ' committee . There he feels a sense of purpose as part of an organized political collective . Through attrition , Weiler 's Farm has dwindled over three years from 10,000 to 1,000 people . <p> They are among 7 million blacks without permanent housing , about one-quarter of the black population . Since the system of influx control known as the " pass laws " was abolished in 1986 , hundreds of thousands of blacks have streamed to the cities in search of employment . The prospect of huge shantytowns sprawled around major cities - once the ruling National Party 's nightmare - is now accepted as a reality for the forseeable future . <p> Lamola has not yet built a shack in Orange Farm and lives in the shanty built by his late father-in-law for Emily 's mother . Attempts to mobilize his new community have proven difficult . Residents are acquiring a vested interest in the new-found security of owning land and homes and see the prospect of improving their bleak fortunes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $3,200 ( with 95 percent of that amount borrowed ) , they can buy a hastily built stucco home . <p> After the African National Congress ( ANC ) was legalized last February , Silas became involved in trying to form a branch in Orange Farm . His efforts were thwarted by residents who have aligned with the provincial authorities to try to increase services to their area . Now his energies are devoted to organizing the ANC-aligned local street committees that he sees as vital to the struggle for empowerment . <p> " Life has changed . If I had a problem in the old days , I would tell my parents and they would summon uncles and elders , " he says . " Now if someone has a problem , they come to me - so I have to go to the street committee . " <p> A year ago there were more shacks than permanent homes here . Today homes outnumber shacks . The pink-painted Lamola shanty is becoming an island among the burgeoning houses of an aspiring middle class . <p> Emily , a member of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to build a house and seek more of a balance between efforts for the family and for the community . <p> " She sometimes gets very upset with me , " concedes Silas . " But I just ca n't leave all these people behind . " <p> He has tried . After moving to Orange Farm in 1989 , he took a job as an electrical assistant . He earned $300 a month , spent much of his time traveling , and felt like a " fish out of water , " being separated from his community . He did n't fit into the business mold and came into conflict with what he saw as exploitative working conditions . " I was soon looked on as a troublemaker , because I was not satisfied with many of the employer 's practices , " he says . Today he devotes his time to helping Emily run the community nursery school . She earns $320 a month , and is the sole breadwinner . <p> On one of this reporter 's visits , Silas was going to the city to buy a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , but found it was too big . He hung it behind a curtain dividing the living room from the tiny bedroom . By the next week , when he was able to go back to the shop , the suit was impregnated with dust and needed to be dry cleaned to be returned . <p> " How can we go on living like this ? " he asks , glancing at Emily . " For the sake of the family I might build a house here . " <p> That would be a turning point in Silas Lamola 's journey from the old order to the new . <p> /
