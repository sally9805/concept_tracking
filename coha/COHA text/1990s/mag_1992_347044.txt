When the time comes for British government leaders to recommend the next honors list to Queen Elizabeth II , they might consider bestowing titles of some sort on Mia Farrow and Woody Allen . After all , the noisy bust-up of the American film stars ' 12-year relationship served the British monarchy handsomely by shoving off the front pages of frenzy-feeding tabloids the photographs of a topless Duchess of York , a.k.a . Fergie , cavorting poolside with her American boyfriend in the presence of her two royal daughters at a rented St.-Tropez villa . <P> But the salacious news about someone else , for a change , brought no lasting respite for the beleaguered House of Windsor . Up popped a transcript of an alleged telephone conversation between Diana , Princess of Wales , and a male friend on New Year 's Eve 1989 . He calls her " Squidgy " and repeats , " I love you , I love you . " She mentions the " torture " of her marriage and agrees to a meeting with her phone partner " next Tuesday , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Who cares , when 40,000 Britons paid $22 each on the first day to call a special phone line and listen to the tape ? Three days after this bombshell , the Sun , Britain 's raciest tabloid , announced it possessed another juicy phone transcript , this one of a conversation between Fergie and Prince Andrew in January 1990 . During this call , the paper claimed , the duchess said she wanted to escape the marriage and go off to Argentina , where her mother lives after bolting from her father . Andrew and Fergie separated in March of this year . <P> These scandals capped a spring and summer of monarchical discontent . In April the palace announced that after two years of separation , Princess Anne would divorce Captain Mark Phillips , her husband of 18 years . June saw the publication of journalist Andrew Morton 's best seller on Princess Diana , portraying in excruciating detail the travails of a young woman trapped in a cold and loveless marriage . Morton 's accounts of her five suicide attempts and struggles with the eating disorder bulimia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were the signs that Morton had enjoyed the cooperation of Diana 's friends and relatives , who presumably would not have talked had the princess told them not to . More than a few interested observers surmised that the wife of the current heir  --  Prince Charles  --  and the mother of the heir presumptive  --  Prince William  --  was building a case in the court of public opinion for an eventual divorce . <P> Much of the world remains fascinated by the pomp and circumstances of the Windsors . But British subjects pay a considerable freight , estimated at as much as $140 million from the national budget per year , for the upkeep of an ever extending royal family . Many have begun to wonder whether the investment is worth it . What is this younger generation coming to ? And are n't there rather a lot of them ? And what are they good for , besides embarrassing themselves , titillating us commoners and boosting the circulation of tabloids ?
