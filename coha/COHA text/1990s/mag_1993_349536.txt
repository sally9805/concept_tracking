Joycelyn Elders , the pediatrician nominated to be Surgeon General , was the first in her sharecropper family of eight children to go to college , working her way through Philander Smith , a black institution in Arkansas , as a cleaning woman . When she was home one weekend , her younger brother Chester , now a Methodist minister in Pine Bluff , realized that she had begun to change when she took her siblings to the drive-in to see a movie . " She went to a section not marked off for coloreds , " says her brother . " The attendant told her to move , and they got in a heated argument . We started to cry . We were n't into the politics of life ; we just wanted to see the movie . Finally she and the attendant compromised on how far back we would go . That 's when I first noticed my sister was a little different . " <P> This week , when the Senate opens hearings on the Elders nomination , the rest of the U.S. will find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little different . While she has the bedside manner of the white- coated physician , she has also been a verbal bomb thrower , trying to wake up Arkansas citizenry to the health crises in teenage pregnancy and AIDS by promoting sex education , birth control and freedom of choice on abortion . Just after her appointment in 1987 , Elders was asked if school-based clinics would dispense contraceptives . She replied , " I 'm not going to put condoms on their lunch trays , but yes . " <P> The controversy grew from there . Antiabortion activists have called her a " mass murderer " and " director of the Arkansas Holocaust . " Her reputation has provoked a coalition of national right-to-life groups to challenge her nomination . " We are deadly opposed to her confirmation , " says James A. Smith , a lobbyist for the Christian Life Commission . But the White House contends it is ready to fight for this nominee . Says Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala : " She is colorful and plainspoken , and Americans like people who are straightforward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has come out against her , but no one expects it to stop there . <P> Elders has been in battle most of her life . It was a struggle to escape rural Schaal , Arkansas . She started school at four , walking five miles daily to catch the bus . At night , she helped her father stretch raccoon hides , which he sold to Sears . After college , she enlisted in the Army and trained as a physical therapist . Later , she was the only black woman in her class at the University of Arkansas medical school . <P> She made enemies traveling the state preaching that the consequences of irresponsible sex should not be a child who will more than likely grow up uncared for . She has not taken her lumps quietly . Elders attacks her religious-right critics as " non-Christians " who harbor " slave-master mentalities . " Last year Elders told an abortion-rights rally that abortion foes need to get over their " love affair with the fetus . " Earlier this month on a CNBC call-in show , Elders was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who sell sex to buy drugs , get pregnant and have crack- addicted babies . " That 's a real problem , " the pragmatic Elders replied . " I would hope that we would be able to provide them with Norplant , so they could still use sex if they must to buy their drugs and not have unplanned babies . "
