<p> SANTA CLARA , Calif . Andrew Grove wants to get something straight : He 's tired of talking to reporters , smiling for photographers and hearing talk about Intel being the King Kong of computer-chip makers . <p> " In truth , our execution is not perfect by a long shot , " says Grove , Intel 's CEO . " But we 're better than most people in this business . " <p> Better ? How about best ? Intel practically owns the market for microprocessors the tiny chips that control personal computers made by IBM , Compaq and every other PC maker except Apple . <p> Intel is so dominant that its customers have no choice but to wait for its latest chips before they can ship new PC lines . PC giants such as Compaq and Dell are now waiting for Intel to provide them with limited shipments of its latest marvel , dubbed Pentium . <p> Intel expects to ship about 10,000 Pentiums next quarter , a pittance considering it will ship about 7 million 486 chips the Pentium 's predecessor the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it has told customers not to introduce Pentium-based machines until May . Agreeing to the embargo was part of the price for getting on Intel 's short list of customers that receive Pentium first . " They are the dominant player . . . and they play the game well , " says Peter Wilson of BIS Strategic Decisions . <p> Intel 's product strategy is simple but effective : bring out a chip once every three or four years that cannibalizes the preceding model . The 286 , introduced in 1982 , was replaced by the 386 in 1985 , which gave way to the 486 in 1989 . The 486 eventually will be overtaken by sales of Pentium , called the 586 by industry diehards , and so on . <p> Moving that fast makes it impossible for rivals such as Cyrix and Advanced Micro Devices to keep pace . Usually , it takes Intel 's rivals about three years to come up with chips that are near duplicates of Intel 's latest offerings . By the time they do , Intel is starting to ship a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for $ 800 to $ 1,000 . <p> Intel 's rivals are left selling chips based on relatively old technology at discounted prices . When the 386 was introduced in 1985 , it cost about $ 300 . Now AMD dominates the 386 market , but the chips sell for only $ 40 each . <p> How did Intel become so dominant ? The reasons range from technological wizardry to luck : <p> Luck . Intel got a big break in 1981 when IBM asked it to supply the microprocessor for its original PC . Others , including Motorola , were in the running . One reason Intel won : it had a chip ready to go . At the time , IBM was a bit player . But it became the dominant player , and every PC maker except Apple copied IBM 's technology including using Intel chips . <p> A wealth of talent . Grove can be as surly as he is charming , but people inside and outside Intel agree that he is brilliant . " People have respect for Andy the way you have respect for dynamite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Beyond the CEO 's seat , Intel has populated its ranks with the best minds in the business . Intel has an aggressive recruiting program that targets the top schools in the USA MIT , Stanford and others . Recruiters work with professors to identify candidates early as sophomores or juniors . Ditto for students in graduate programs . Candidates are wooed relentlessly by recruiters , who team with Intel engineers . <p> Lightweight rivals . The Japanese long have been huge players in the world market for computer chips . But they concentrate on workhorse memory chips known as DRAMs , which store information in PCs . DRAMs sell in huge volumes at low prices . That left the microprocessor business to Intel , Motorola and a handful of smaller U.S. rivals . <p> Grove 's personal philosophy , " only the paranoid survive , " is the centerpiece of Intel 's business strategy . " There are two things that drive this company technology and paranoia , " agrees Vin Dham , who oversees the Pentium project . <p> Grove , for his part , grouses that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time interviewing him . But Grove is as photogenic as he is quotable . <p> Grove 's nature permeates a corporate culture that 's sure to test all but the thickest skins . Company meetings can be screamfests in which the loudest voice wins . Ideas are challenged loudly and often by senior executives . <p> Visitors are n't spared . Hutcheson was giving a presentation at Intel a few years ago when an Intel executive interrupted him to announce , " I do n't know who in the hell you are , but I know you 're full of s  --  because you 're not from Intel . " Hutcheson says the executive continued to hammer him on every point in his presentation . " I was telling someone about it afterward , and he said , ' You have just been to a typical Intel management meeting , ' " Hutcheson says . <p> Intel employees acknowledge that the internal creative process can be rough . But they say such verbal hazing referred to as constructive confrontation is necessary to keep Intel focused . " I love to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , " says Craig Barrett , Intel 's chief operating officer . <p> But a lot of people do n't love it . Intel 's management style has created an environment that makes it difficult for quiet but brilliant researchers to speak up . Grove admits that a lot of good ideas do n't percolate to the top . <p> " That 's not just a loss for the individual . It 's a loss for the corporation , " says Grove . Intel recently started programs to address that problem . Management offers courses in " speaking under pressure " and " constructive confrontation , " two skills that come in handy at Intel . <p> Adding to Intel 's market muscle is capital spending that borders on frenetic . Intel has spent as much on plant upgrades the last three years as it did the previous 22 about $ 5 billion . Grove , in trademark paranoid style , worries about overinvesting in expectation that sales will remain healthy . " History is full of people who thought the sky would stay blue forever , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PC sales is sending Intel 's stock price ever skyward . The stock , which dropped 1 Tuesday to $ 118 , could break into the $ 140s by the end of the year , some financial analysts believe . Just two years ago , Intel 's stock was trading in the $ 50s . In October , it traded in the $ 60s before it started to soar . <p> Intel 's revenue should approach $ 9 billion this year , vs. $ 3 billion five years ago . Net income is expected to climb 74% to $ 1.8 billion , estimates Daniel Klesken of Robertson Stephens &; Co . <p> Despite Intel 's success , Grove has two major concerns . He says : <p> Ill-conceived projects consume too much time and money before they get axed . Grove says Intel stopped three major projects last year after engineers talked to customers and decided the products would misfire in the marketplace . One project , he says with disgust , ate up 400 engineer years about 6 million working hours before it was killed . If people thought harder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started or would be killed earlier . <p> Last year , AMD all but ran Intel out of the market for 386 chips . Grove admits that Intel did n't pay enough attention to the competition , which was able to capitalize on gaping holes in Intel 's 386 product line . The 486 and Pentium is more important to Intel 's future , but 386-based PCs still account for 40% of industry sales . <p> Intel is counterattacking with no fewer than 30 versions of the 486 chip this year . That should assure that there are no holes in the product line for competitors to fill . <p> Competitors say they are n't worried . " We 're very good at finding niches Intel ca n't find , " says Cyrix 's Mike Bruzzone . Cryrix already has a 486-type chip in the market and plans to have a Pentium competitor ready by Christmas . AMD plans to have a 486 by year end and a Pentium version within two years . <p> Grove is worried because " nothing lasts forever . " One need look no further than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that . So he worries about competitors , the pressure to perform and what 's coming around the technological curve . " The more successful we are , the higher the hurdle . . . . Our job is to keep the spiral going . "
