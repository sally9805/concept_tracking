There is a reckless streak in many of us , a brashness that is usually channeled harmlessly into leisure pursuits like bungee jumping or indulgences such as an extra piece of chocolate-mousse cake . But for James McDermott , 48 , the former chief executive of the New York City investment bank Keefe , Bruyette &; Woods , that recklessness led to the arms of an adult-video actress and then to the even longer arms of the law . The banker was charged last week with insider trading for allegedly tipping off Kathryn Gannon , 30 , better known as Marylin Star , to a series of impending bank mergers . According to federal prosecutors , the Canadian-born actress traded six times on this information and made $88,000 through an online brokerage account  --  often investing money McDermott sent via certified checks drawn on a bank account he shared with his wife . McDermott was freed on $1 million bail last week , and authorities issued an arrest warrant for Gannon , who was believed to be in Canada . <P> I met Marylin Star four years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leading adult production companies . I was writing a story about the $5 billion adult-entertainment industry , and she represented , in many ways , the heart and dark soul of that industry : a pretty , vivacious , surgically enhanced blond woman who was paid thousands of dollars to have sex on tape . <P> Before the video camera rolls at a shoot , adult performers present each other with identification and valid  --  less than 90-day-old  --  HIV tests to prove that neither performer carries the virus . The exchange is routine and ritualistic , like a coin toss before a football game . I was watching and noticed that Marylin Star 's driver 's license read Kathryn Akahoshi , prompting me to ask why this blond had a Japanese name . She had become a stripper in Calgary while still a teenager , hitting Los Angeles in the mid- ' 90s to enter the adult-video business and then diving into a marriage with a Japanese businessman . The couple subsequently divorced . She was articulate and confident , and I got the feeling that for her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next big score . Then she said something that struck me as unusual coming from an adult-video actress : " I 'm really into the stock market . " <P> Perhaps that 's what drew her to McDermott , or at least elevated their relationship to the point where she boasted to friends about her " really rich boyfriend . " McDermott was certainly a man who knew the market , having worked his way up from entry-level research analyst to CEO of Keefe , Bruyette &; Woods , a boutique investment bank . The firm was on the verge of what would have been his crowning achievement , a $100 million public offering last May . But days before the IPO , the firm canceled the deal when McDermott told his partners he was under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission for giving stock tips to a friend . " It was n't until I saw the subpoena that I saw a name attached to this so-called friend , " says John Duffy , the firm 's current CEO . " Clearly there were things he did n't tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months . I kind of wish it was six years . " <P>  --  With reporting by William Dowell/New York
