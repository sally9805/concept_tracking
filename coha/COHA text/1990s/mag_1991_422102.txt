Section : FAR CRY <p> In April , Linda and I walked in the water 's tracks down a dry canyon cut in deep meanders through Navajo sandstone . There was only one flower : locoweed , tiny staircases of gray-green leaves climbing to the folded pea blooms , white and light violet . It had snowed the week before , but the moisture had disappeared fast . New water lay pooled in a few spots where the slope of the creekbed had reached an impermeable layer of rock , and older water rested in the scooped bowls under the pour-offs from side canyons , murky and rich as good jade . <p> The law of water says go downstream . Floods had cut deeply , tumbling lava and limestone down from the mountains at the head of the drainage . The side canyons were left hanging as the main stream , with its wilder flows and sharper rocks , carved more quickly . Water and gravity had slowly opened the earth with unequivocal beauty . <p> We followed each descending arc , turning east to south to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above our heads . The walls were steep and definite as the channel veered in slow obedience to gravity . Downstream . Deeper into the rock . In the narrowest parts the only other direction  --  since we could n't fly  --  was upstream . <p> What drives a person out here ? What is there in the air of small towns that entices some to leave the city  --  a waft of clover ? the repose of cottonwoods and weathered fences ? And what still greater promise draws one through the small towns , along gravel roads , then rutted dirt tracks , then trails , then onto the unmarked earth itself ? Wilderness has become a word to conjure with , like love . It means as many things to as many people . <p> Some people out here hate the word , spitting it through mouthfuls of beer and snuff  --  " will-der-nuss "  --  like a Baptist grandma saying " fornication " Wilderness for them is not simply the mountains , the familiar high profile , the source of wood and water . Wilderness is a word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naked and having fun instead of working . Wilderness is the late June flood that blows the headgate and swamps a mile of road , the hairy thing that kills five ewes in one night , the howl of wind around the haystack in February . <p> Yet at the same time , in the same nation , in after-dinner speeches , one can hear the word " wilderness " intoned with the same pitch and reverence as the name of God . It has been chanted to the point where it fails to mean anything specific in place or time , but instead has more to do with desire : Pure . Pristine . Perfect . <p> Outside the wilderness much of what we see is calculated to engage attention , to be bright and colorful , to flicker with brief emotion and throb with music . What we see distracts and persuades , dazzles and urges . Our senses absorb so much contrivance that anything not instantly gratifying seems perverse . <p> As we lose touch with our world , we become ever more demanding and impatient , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we suffer from deprivation of simple , natural truth . <p> That no one tells the whole truth is a postmodern axiom . We are so conscious of language as a tool that we judge it by its effect : Does it increase sales ? Does it draw votes ? Does it bring us what we crave ? A few generations of this lying-for-effect , and we have grown conscious of our loss . We need a benchmark for what is . <p> In the evenings , camped in the dust of an undercut rock wall , I read . In my pack is a book of poems , a small , cheap student edition that sold for thirty-five cents in the 1960s . Emily Dickinson . Born , reared , and died in Amherst , Massachusetts . <p> Why do I choose her ? Why not Thoreau ? Why not Muir , Stegner , Krutch , or Leopold ? Or Ann Zwinger , Bruce Chatwin , or Patricia Limerick ? Why not Ed Abbey , the newly risen saint of the good , red country ? Emily Dickinson was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not every book about wilderness reads well in the wild . Too many seem like footnotes , set against what meets the eye . Not Emily : <p> Had I not seen the Sun I could have borne the shade But Light a newer Wilderness My Wilderness has made  --  <p> When I read this I get a chill , as I do coming around a bend of this canyon , seeing what I 've never seen before . There 's something about following the water down , something about going into the depths of a canyon , accepting enclosure , working out the intimate details of the interior . Suddenly everything corresponds , the arc of the canyon and the braid of a soul : a perfect fit . What 's strange and fine is that these elements are so diverse  --  careless , water-cut stone and the careful poems of a white recluse , one hundred and five years dead . <p> I spend my working life in a wilderness in the central Rockies . It used to be summer work , but has become year-round . I follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from sandals to boots , to skis and back again . <p> The place itself has slowly come to mean more than grand abstractions like pure , pristine , or perfect . In fact , it has come to mean an escape from abstractions , freedom from them . There is no persuasion in a granite boulder , no parable in a lone paintbrush among the columbines . <p> This canyon is like my home range , mysterious with real things . Everything I see or touch rings with itself : sandstone , locoweed , scrub oak , chert . Watching and naming is my life 's work , keeping the edges sharp like the black boundary of shade from an overhang . An odd , smooth stone catches my eye , dove-gray among the reds and golds . Like an egg , it rests heavy and cool in the palm , pocked at the end where somebody , sometime , used it as a hammer . It 's good to sit without saying anything and hold it in my hand : a rock , then a tool , then a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the heft and presence of the world . <p> Wilderness has also become a legal tag , which generally means that one is not to use motors at ground level . In a legal wilderness , we are not allowed to whack down trees or subdivide or bulldoze parking lots or produce explosions , broadcast music , install security lights , speed , flash credit cards , or engage in most of the other activities that distinguish modern American life . Wilderness  --  like church  --  is where we are supposed to be what we manifestly are not : quiet , calm , aware , peaceful , reverent , and contemplative . <p> One of the reasons that the notion of wilderness gives us such trouble is that we confuse our notions with real things , that we live in our thoughts more than in the world that surrounds us . We are so soaked in our messages that we have trouble distinguishing a word from the thing itself . Our perspective is skewed , so that we see the natural world as a mere element in our mental worlds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I love this canyon because it is not a library or a zoo . Because it is n't a book or a movie . Because everything here proceeds from incorruptible sources . Because it tells me to do nothing that I do n't need to do . Find water . Eat . Sleep . Because I have the freedom to act foolishly and because there are always consequences . I love this canyon because it does n't need me to exist . <p> A Color stands abroad On Solitary Fields That Science can not overtake But Human Nature feels . <p> " My country is Truth , " says Emily . Truth is something like gravity : It always pulls toward a common center . Language is a wooly wilderness inside us , blooming and howling . We strive to make it do as we wish , yet something in it resists . Language , like the earth , has a center of gravity . Words draw power from what they represent . The farther a word is placed from that center , the thinner and lighter it becomes . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cracks at a touch . It encloses truth 's country like brittle parentheses . " Collateral damage " does not mean the same as human deaths : The phrase tries to contain them . <p> Or think of language as heritage . Linguists draw the same kind of charts as geneticists , and speak of stocks and hybrids . Geneticists talk of DNA as a code . Language adapts , crossbreeds , and mutates . Like genes , it can also be damaged , words deformed or sterilized . Not all can be remade : The backbrain and the backcountry are rootstocks . The wild syllables nudge at the cage of lips and we slip out of the numb cadences of usefulness . I used to be afraid of the wilderness , scared to fall asleep , camped alone in the dark . Now it 's my refuge , the cupped rock that holds my dream like water . <p> At the mouth of a side canyon that plunges between two gold monoliths , the slickrock has a necklace of pools . We sit by the deepest one to eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a strange , ascending cry , unlike the familiar redtail skreeeeee . Peregrine , Linda says . Nothing to do but watch and listen . <p> Later I look for a place to camp . Linda is tired , so she leans against a boulder in the center of the streambed , a rock that moves once every century , when the flood of floods roars down and sweeps the canyon clean , rolling the boulder another hundred steps , carving another measure of sand from its tawny flank . <p> I scout the rimrock benches and dip into a side canyon , looking for an undercut that opens south for shelter , east for morning light . I know I will not be the first to find such a place here . Even though we think of wilderness as untouched , the good camps have all been used before , like words in the language . The sandy shadow will have been lit by fires and the silence will have echoed to " Come , Come Ye Saints " in nineteenth-century English , to coyote stories in Paiute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 'll rest tonight among the echoes under a late-rising moon , three nights past full . <p> Having a debt to the place , owing for beauty and shelter and sleep , I 'll discharge a part , what I ca n't keep , with this telling . The place , like truth , will remain nameless . I am not an explorer , nor a guide . <p> As Emily Dickinson said , " My business is to sing . " <p> ILLUSTRATION <p> By C. L.
