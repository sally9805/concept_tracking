U.S. Representative Nydia Velazquez , 43 , knows how easy it is for medical secrets to find their way out of a doctor 's files . When Velazquez was running for Congress in 1992 to represent New York City 's 12th Congressional District , someone got hold of hospital records detailing her 1991 suicide attempt and forwarded them by anonymous fax to the press . The New York Post broke the story , and Velazquez was forced to acknowledge publicly something even her family did not know : she had tried to kill herself with sleeping pills and vodka . Despite the painful publicity , she won the election  --  and now she is suing the hospital for $10 million . <P> Public figures are not the only ones who should be worried about the confidentiality of their medical records . Last month a coalition of groups that help aids patients in Boston went to court in an effort to stop auditors at the Department of Health and Human Services from passing on the names of patients in various aids programs to other government agencies . And two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the military with samples of their DNA , something the Pentagon now demands of all service personnel . <P> The Marines ' fear was that the information would wind up in the hands of a future employer or insurer . That fear was well placed . Companies and government agencies have already claimed the right to tap individual health files . More than a quarter of Americans responding to a 1993 Harris poll said health information about them had been improperly disclosed . The issue has caught Congress 's attention : legislation designed to protect medical-record privacy  --  but which critics say is too lax  --  is pending before the Senate . <P> Medical records contain some of the most sensitive of personal information  --  including sexual orientation , past drug use and genetic predisposition to various diseases . As part of the Hippocratic oath , physicians promise to keep whatever they learn about a patient to themselves . But it 's hard to keep a secret if more than a couple of people are in on it ; in a typical five-day stay at a teaching hospital , as many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to billing clerks  --  have legitimate access to a single patient 's records . <P> Now hospitals are rushing to computerize those records , raising the fear that medical secrets could be accessed , copied and distributed with a few clicks of a mouse . There are plenty of good reasons to gather such information : to spot previously unknown drug interactions , for example , or to provide early warning of a newly emerging epidemic . But once the records have been digitized , they can be transmitted without a trace all over the globe .
