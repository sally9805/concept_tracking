ALL EYES ON CRUISE AND KIDMAN <P> " Is Stanley Kubrick 's last film so important that we need to see its stars half-naked on your cover ? " BEN MARTIN Roanoke , Va . <P> Congratulations on that beautiful Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman cover CINEMA , July 5 . Be not dismayed by the flood of letters you get that will berate you as a purveyor of pornography . People who abhor the sight of beautiful human bodies are possessed by either a dirty mind or envy . GEORGE ZINNEMANN Annapolis , Md . <P> Are you testing the waters for a merger with the National Enquirer ? Why put a naked pair of screen lovers on the cover that has borne the likenesses of truly important world leaders , great scientists , athletes and entrepreneurs ? DAVID L. WALLACH Bridgeville , Pa . <P> Self-righteous Puritans will denounce your cover in the name of family values and decency . But this is how a healthy couple in love show their affection for each other . Since when has it been offensive for a married couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sad that Hollywood has become the foremost promoter of decadence in American society . MATT C. ABBOTT Chicago <P> What an absolutely beautiful photograph ! Tom 's a hunk ; Nicole is lovely ; and together they are gorgeous . You 'll probably get lots of complaints , but the cover made shivers run down my spine ! PATRICE BINGHAM OFFENHAUSER Reno , Nev . <P> I would be much happier never knowing about the sex lives of Bill Clinton , Cruise or Kidman . No thanks to Ken Starr or TIME . Please , let 's keep it above the belt for the remainder of this year . DELMER GROSS Sycamore , Ill . <P> Director Stanley Kubrick was so ahead of his time technically and artistically that he transcended it , becoming as much an oracle as an auteur . With his visions of a hedonistic and machinistic future undeniably at hand , Kubrick bowed out just before things start to really go awry . Kubrick rivaled Freud in his ability to probe our collective unconscious . His final masterpiece , Eyes Wide Shut , is a testament to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture has become desensitized to violence , while human sexuality is still as taboo as in the days of Adam and Eve . COLIN MCDONALD Waterbury , Conn . <P> STILL COMMITTED TO THE CAUSE <P> The subtitle of your story that referred to me , " Why a defender of affirmative action is quitting , " was misleading DIVIDING LINE , July 5 . I remain committed to affirmative action because it works ; it 's fair and vitally necessary if we are to live up to the American ideal of giving every person a fair chance . I was proud to serve as executive director of Americans for a Fair Chance . My departure should not be construed in any way as a change of heart in my steadfast commitment to carry on the fight . Also , it is important to note that anti-affirmative-action initiatives for higher education have won in only two states ; that can hardly be called a victory . I plan to continue to work for equal opportunity through affirmative action . RENE REDWOOD Washington <P> WITCHES IN THE ARMY     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
