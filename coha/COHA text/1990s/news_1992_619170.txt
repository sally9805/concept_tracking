<p> FEMINISM came early to the silent movies in the form of the cliff-hanging serial queen  --  the heroine who displayed physical strength , endurance and an ability to take charge and exert power in a man 's world . <p> The female-oriented serials  --  depicting kidnapings , death traps , car and train chases , wild and woolly brawls , and last-second rescues  --  thrived from the early 1910s until the mid- ' 20s , eventually comprising 60 films made up of 800 individual episodes . Today , these queens of the cliff-hangers , actresses who were fashionable symbols of their period , are largely forgotten except for Pauline Fay White , whose " Perils of Pauline " serial has been kept alive over the years by two motion-picture remakes . Betty Hutton portrayed the rambunctious actress in a fanciful 1947 biography , and a 1967 Pamela Austin-Pat Boone comedy parodied the serial form . <p> Cinematheque associate Laura Poitras , who has taken a special interest in serial queens in recent years , has assembled a selection of these action-packed adventures for " In Danger and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " which will be screened at 8 p.m . Thursday at the San Francisco Art Institute , 800 Chestnut Street . <p> " The thing I found most intriguing in these films was an underlying sexual tension , " Poitras said . " The adventures are always eroticized ; the women were always coming up against dark male forces that bound and gagged them , tried to burn them , threw them into water and pits , and took them into deep subterranean chambers . There 's this recurring image of the heroine escaping the clutches of evil by emerging through a hole , usually in the form of a trapdoor . " <p> Another aspect of feminine cliff-hangers that Poitras found compelling was the fact that " although these women were very self-determined , their strength was undercut by their victimization . As strong as they seemed , they were still nothing but pawns to be tossed about as the villains saw fit . " <p> The first of the serial queens  --  but not one to be associated with action or derring-do  --  was Mary Fuller , a popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in " What Happened to Mary ? , " a series based on a character that had first appeared in popular short stories in The Ladies ' World magazine . The one-reel films , in fact , were direct offshoots of the magazine and were released monthly to coincide with the publication of new stories . <p> Unlike serials to come , which would feature cliff-hangers at the end of each episode , " What Happened to Mary ? " offered self-contained , mildly melodramatic adventures about a naive but sincere young woman making her way through big-city life . <p> Poitras has selected two examples . In " Mary in Stage Land " ( Chapter 3 ) , Mary replaces her best friend in the musical " The Society Queen " and finds her friendship in danger when the friend becomes jealous . In " The Affair at Raynor 's " ( Chapter 4 ) , Mary takes a job in a real-estate office and prevents a swindler from stealing money from the company safe . <p> The Mary Fuller series was so successful that by 1914 there were 11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Love , Girl of Mystery , " " The Adventures of Kathlyn " and " The Hazards of Helen . " The latter was , for its time , a breathtaking series of 119 films that used trains and railroads in every way imaginable as Helen Holmes was tied to the tracks by the Oilcan Harry-types of the day and subjected to all the dangers on the rails . <p> Poitras has selected a 1915 sampling of " The Hazards of Helen . " In Chapter 96 , " The Governor 's Special , " the athletic Holmes helps a convicted killer ( really a good guy wrongly accused ) escape his captors from aboard a speeding train . In one spectacular stunt , she races along in a handcar on a track running parallel to the hell-bent train . As the two sets of tracks narrow down to one , she lassos the engine with a rope and pulls herself aboard the engine just as the handcar is crushed to pieces . Holmes was one gritty gal who would go on to star in other popular serials , her specialty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to leap from train to horse . Her acting career never lasted beyond the reign of the serial queens , and she died in obscurity in 1950 . <p> Poitras said it was essential to include " A Woman in Grey " ( 1919 ) , as it offers a splendid example of the sadistic and often bizarre death traps that abounded in these serials . Aline Pretty portrays the titular figure , Ruth Hope , who joins with her boyfriend Tom Thurston to find , with the aid of secret codes , a hidden treasure in an abandoned mansion . In " Burning Strands " ( Chapter 9 ) , the pistol-packing Hope is subjected to possible death via a secret chamber of steel spikes , concealed by a trapdoor on which one of her high heels is precariously perched . In another predicament , she is bound to a bed and gagged while overhead a steel block is held in place by a slender spike that could give way at any moment . <p> Seeing just one of the 20 chapters of the historic " Perils of Pauline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White was the tiara-deserving queen of the serial stars . <p> " Perils , " produced by Pathe in conjunction with William Randolph Hearst , who serialized the adventures in his newspapers , is the ongoing adventures of an heiress ( White ) who has agreed to marry her suitor on the condition she be given one year to pursue adventure . These adventures highlight races in cars , airplanes , balloons , submarines and other modern machinery and feature battles with a variety of Indians , pirates , cowboys and sailors in swift pursuit . <p> Two installments will be presented . " The Goddess of the West " ( Chapter 2 ) finds Pauline on the prairie , the captive of wild Indians . The savages decide she was sent by the gods and they put her through a death ritual , rolling huge boulders at her and attempting to push her off a cliff . <p> " The Reptile in the Flowers " ( Chapter 8 ) manages to pack three cliff-hangers into its 23 minutes . It opens with Pauline and her lover Harry Marvin ( played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ villain Koerner and his henchman Balthazar throw a bag over Pauline 's head and abduct her to a Gypsy ( " Bohemian " in the title cards ) camp . <p> Harry soon rescues her by throwing wine bottles at Balthazar  --  shards of flying glass cut down the villain . Balthazar 's wife , Singoalla , decides to avenge his death by placing a poisonous snake in a basket of flowers and having them delivered to Pauline 's home . Unsuspecting , the heroine leans down to smell the roses , pressing her face closer and closer . . . In the third adventure , Pauline buys a thoroughbred and races it in a steeplechase . <p> White had started out as a circus trick rider but after injuring her spine in a fall , was forced to move on to traveling stock companies . Troubled by her back , she took a job with a film company , only to be discovered by a producer who was taken by her photogenic qualities . She made her film debut in " The Life of Buffalo Bill . " A personable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comedies and Westerns and made more than 100 one-reelers . She was among the first actresses whose name was used in the titles of her films . The play on words in the serial title  --  " Perils " for " Pearl "  --  came about as a result . <p> WHITE was also one of the first actresses whose name was used in print advertising . Her billings included " The Lady Daredevil of the Fillums " and " Thrilling , Terrifying , Titanic , Terrific , the Death Defying Sensation . " <p> White 's thespian talents were minimal but her personality sparkled as Pauline . She endured her escapes from death without as much as mussing the hairs of her blond wig and conveyed a sense of having fun  --  enough to satisfy the unsophisticated audiences of the day . <p> White endured a real-life cliff-hanger during production of " Pauline " when a hot-air balloon in which she was being filmed escaped its mooring lines and drifted across the Hudson River toward New York . A safe landing was made in Philadelphia . <p> White 's career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next nine years . " The Exploits of Helene " ( 1914 ) starred White as Elaine Dodge , a " thoroughly modern type of girl . " In " The Clutching Hand " ( Chapter 1 ) , one of Poitras ' selections , she matches wits with a mysterious underworld figure who would set the style for the caped , dark villains of future serials . <p> Publicity claimed that White did all of her own stunts , but that was brought into question in 1923 when a stunt man doubling for her leaped from a moving bus to a bridge , slipped and dropped to his death . She quit making serials , refused to talk about the accident and retired from the screen . She died in 1938 at age 49 . <p> If White had a rival , it was San Francisco-born Ruth Roland , whom film historians now consider a superior actress , with better story material to boot . In the 1920s she was dubbed " Queen of the Thriller Serials . " Cinematheque 's show will include one episode from " The Adventures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child star known on the stage as " Baby Ruth , " she surpassed White in terms of her athletic prowess as well , but could not escape her type-casting after the serial trend died out . She made only three nonserial films before her death in 1937 , at age 45.
