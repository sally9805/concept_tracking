French industrialist Francis Mer wants to reshape the American steel industry . <p> TO THE U.S. business community , Usinor-Sacilor is n't exactly household word . But if Francis Met has his way , it soon will be . <p> Mer , 51 , is Usinor-Sacilor 's chief executive . Usinor-Sacilor is the big , state-owned French steel company that is emerging as a tough , formidable player in the global steel market . Heavily bankrolled by the French government during the 1980s  --  to the tune of over $16 billion to finance new blast furnaces and computer-controlled rolling mills  --  Usinor-Sacilor promises to be a burr under the saddle of big U.S. and Japanese steelmakers . The company 's strategy , says Christopher Plummet of the Bala Cynwyd , Pa. - based economic consultants WEFA , is to go directly after the markets of the major U.S. companies . Usinor-Sacilor , says Plummet , intends to be " at the forefront of the globalization of the steel industry . " <p> France 's government , led by socialist manque Francois Mitterrand , is egging on Usinor-Sacilor and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) to become world leaders in their respective industries . " We have to make French companies international players now , " says a Minister of Industry official , " because if we wait there wo n't be anything left to buy . " <p> The steelmaker 's revenue last year reached 97 billion francs ( $19.4 billion , at current exchange rates ) , and operating income reached a record 10.6 billion francs ( $2 billion ) . With annual production of some 23 million tons  --  the U.S. ' USX Corp. , by contrast , produces 14 million tons  --  Usinor-Sacilor represents nearly all French steel production . <p> But , with the German production facilities it recently took over , Usinor-Sacilor is a solid number two in Germany behind Thyssen . Already number two in the world in production , after Nippon Steel ( at 29 million tons a year ) , Usinor-Sacilor has been on an aggressive spending spree . Since the beginning of the year it has spent $1.2 billion to snap up nearly a score of companies outright or through joint ventures . Its biggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's J &L; Specialty Products Corp. , put the French company squarely in the American market and : got around the Voluntary Restraint Agreement . The J &L; deal also lifted its share to 25% of the world stainless steel market , the only segment of the industry that 's still growing . <p> Mer 's U.S. ambitions were not sated with J &L.; He bought J &L'S; biggest customer , Nashua , N.H.-based Edgcomb Steel Corp. ; two specialty steel . makers , Techalloy and Alloy &; Stainless ; and a 50% interest in Georgetown , S.C.-based Georgetown Steel , a maker of steel cord for use in tires . These outfits are all in niche markets that Usinor-Sacilor can dominate , Moreover , they will also be used to ! make products Usinor-Sacilor hopes to develop for new markets , such as low-nickel stainless steel for appliances and industrial fixtures . <p> The French steelmaker has also been busy forging links in Europe and the Middle East . It is helping to build a $90 million hot rolling mill in Turkey that it will supply and has bought a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to get closer to what the distributors ' customers  --  auto and appliance companies  --  need in new products . <p> All Mer 's U.S. acquisitions have a common thread : They supply the auto industry , in competition with Armco , Allegheny Ludlum and others . That 's a market the company knows well in Europe . It has forged important ties with Peugeot and Renault . Its skill at making high-tech coated steel and its customer service made it the first non-Japanese steelmaker to supply Nissan 's British factories with specially crafted anticorrosion sheet steel . <p> What 's next ? Usinor-Sacilor needs a basic flat rolled steelmaker to complete its American package . Since last spring Mer has been sniffing around LTV , the U.S. ' third-largest steel company ( annual production : 2 million tons ) . The attraction : a major toehold in the auto market with its Indiana Harbor , Ill. site , a world-record setter . Usinor-Sacilor has been busy negotiating to buy between 20% and 80% of LTV 'S steel facilities to avoid assuming the onerous pension liabilities that drove LTV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from ? State subsidies , which funded Usinor-Sacilor 's major overhaul , ended in 1988 . Since then , the company has thrown off over $6 billion in cash  --  all tax free , because it 's not yet close to using up its tax-loss carry-forward . That means Usinor-Sacilor has money to spend , while U.S. companies are scrambling , after three fat years , to keep up capital investments or pay down LBO debt . <p> All this promises to be a major challenge to battle-scarred American steelmakers . They are currently in a slump that has accelerated a series of joint ventures with Japanese partners : Every major producer except Bethlehem Steel now works hand-in-hand with former competitors . Typical was Nippon 's agreement to invest $900 million with Inland Steel , including building a new cold rolling mill to supply sheet steel to automakers . But Usinor-Sacilor , with just as much technical savvy as the Japanese , plans to fight , not share . <p> And why not ? With the cost-saving technology installed with government largesse  --  like the show-stopping computer control room that monitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's labor costs average about $19 an hour , against an average $26 an hour for American workers and $21 an hour for Japanese , including benefits . Virtually all of the company 's steel is continuously cast , compared with only two-thirds , on average , for American steel . At Usinor-Sacilor 's remodeled mill in Gandrange , Lorraine , a team of 130 does the work once done by 700 , twice as efficiently  --  a tenfold productivity improvement . Overall , Usinor-Sacilor 's pretax costs per metric ton are $453 , compared with $503 in the U.S. <p> Mer 's buying spree has n't halted other investments or research . In fact , 30% of the high-profit flat steels he sells did n't exist five years ago . Next year the stainless steel division will inaugurate a pilot strip-casting project , a technological improvement over continuous casting that cools the steel in superthin sheets , instead of slabs that have to be rolled . Potential cost savings : as much as 700 francs per ton . The Americans abandoned a similar project two years ago , says Aristide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We have to wake up more in the U.S. in terms of global markets , " says Adolph Lena , president of Carpenter Technology , which competes against Usinor-Sacilor in the stainless steel market . <p> Not everyone is convinced Mer can make his strategy work . " They 've been buying poor performers in tough markets , " says an analyst with one of the rating agencies . <p> But Mer shrugs off such criticism . " We have to think of the long term , " he says , " or face economic colonization . " The latter may well be the fate of American steelmakers in the face of such powerful competition . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Usinor-Sacilor 's Sollac Florange plant High-tech steel for Japanese cars . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Usinor-Sacilor 's Francis Mer Big plans for French steel . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Producing steel for packaging One billion francs a year to look for new markets . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Control room of hot strip mill at Usinor-Sacilor 's Sollac Fos plant Twelve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By Laura Jereski <p>
