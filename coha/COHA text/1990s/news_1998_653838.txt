<p> The conference room in the Sheraton New Orleans hotel was quiet , save for the shoo-shoo-shoo deep-breathing sounds coming from the 80 men and women in nametags silently circling the room . After a minute , the seminar leader held up her hand to halt the mute crowd . <p> " Now , strike the pose of a hero , " she instructed . " Strike the statue of the gods and goddesses that you are ! " She urged the group to cry out how they felt when they thought of themselves as heroes . There was palpable hesitation , then a human resources manager from Wells Fargo , a string of pearls around her neck , lifted her arms in the air . <p> " I am a thunderbolt ! " she shouted . A man in a Hawaiian-print shirt exclaimed " Hallelujah ! " as he posed , one arm extended behind him as if he were preparing to toss a discus . A computer company executive in high heels put her hands defiantly on her hips and cried , hesitantly : " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If it sounds like an EST seminar or some sort of Tony Robbins inspirational jamboree , it was n't . It was , in fact , one of several instructional sessions offered at a conference  --  actually , the organizers prefer the term " gathering "  --  given this month by Fast Company , a technology-oriented business magazine aimed at young entrepreneurs . A feel-good business bible for the generation that never leaves home without a Palm Pilot , Fast Company is published by Mortimer B. Zuckerman . <p> Fast Company drew 400 people to this , its second " Real Time " conference . And while the magazine may be the first to hold a conference at which a former Secretary of Labor , Robert B. Reich , led an impromptu kazoo concert , it is not alone in its mission . To solidify the ties with their readers  --  and their readers ' checkbooks  --  publishers now organize events for subscribers and readers to attend . <p> " Simply selling a magazine is just not enough anymore , " said Alan M. Webber , one of Fast Company 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magazine encourages readers to form discussion groups , a network of 9,300 readers called the " Company of Friends . " <p> The principle of bringing readers in other than through the pages of a magazine is also at work elsewhere . In the last two years , Jay MacDonald , the chief executive of MacDonald Communications , a New York media company that owns Working Woman and Working Mother magazines , has started four annual conferences  --  not only as an instrument with which to extend the brand identities of his two magazines , but as profit-making ventures . <p> Forbes magazine began the Forbes Management Conference Group in 1995 . McGraw-Hill 's Business Week plays host to 8 to 12 conferences a year . And Time Warner 's Fortune employs a staff of 20 simply for its conference activity . <p> But where other publications ' conferences promote specific objectives , Fast Company seems to use its as a kind of focus group . <p> " Frequently , business magazines have conferences because you 're able to actually have a focus and a theme and a practical outcome , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things that 's different with ours is that we view our gatherings as a part of the editorial product . Other magazines have separate conference arms that are hived off from the editorial group . " <p> Mr. Webber  --  who is fond of saying " Remember , it 's not a magazine , it 's a movement "  --  is a trim 50-year-old who , along with William C. Taylor , grew tired of work as an editor at The Harvard Business Review four years ago . They created a 103-page prototype and , as Mr. Talyor put it , " after a year of wandering the canyons of Manhattan , " sold a majority stake to Mr. Zuckerman . <p> Mr. Taylor added that Mr. Zuckerman 's leadership had been strictly hands off  --  a contrast to what may politely be described as his usual , hands-on dedication to other properties like The Daily News of New York and U.S. News &; World Report . <p> Fast Company , which is based in Boston , is not your parents ' business magazine . It styles itself as a guidebook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changing and increasingly ruthless economy . The magazine 's goal : to encourage readers to think in contrarian terms about the business world . Recent articles include " Money ! Power ! Fame ! ( And Other Ways to Self-Destruct ) " and " Green is Good , " a piece about ecological mindfulness in the corporate world . The magazine 's conference  --  while light on hard information and heavy on motivational speakers  --  was in essence Fast Company 's version of a three-day M.B.A . <p> Judging from the conference here , it is also a chance for those working in technology to work on their people skills . Michael A. Gort , an information technology consultant from Old Greenwich , Conn. , pointed out that working in software , for example , can be lonely . " You can get alienated in this field , " he said . " You can now have an entire product team that develops a product without ever meeting each other . " <p> Peter A. Kalish , the president of a software design company in Orem , Utah , said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on issues with the same " human touch . " <p> " The business press does n't address your feelings , your insecurities , " he added . " The first time I saw Fast Company , I saw that they did . And there 's a lot of fear out there . We all need to address that . " <p> Mr. Taylor , who is 40 , said that kind of feedback kept Fast Company singularly in touch with its readers . " We convene this two-day conversation about where our readers are at , what are they dreaming about and scheming about , what are they worrying about , " he said . " I walk around with a much more visceral appreciation for the kinds of themes and articles and vocabulary words that are going to teach our readers . " <p> The first Real Time conference in May attracted about 400 readers to Monterey , Calif. , the same number who attended the conference here . In New Orleans , the three-day event , began on Sunday evening with a " knowledge hunt "  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play Pictionary on the sidewalk on Bourbon Street  --  and included sessions with titles like " Group Grope , " " Climbing Your Own Everest , " " Here 's What Imagination Sounds Like " and a seminar by a dance troupe about how to " out-dance the competition . " <p> Attendees radiated a caffeinated , hopeful enthusiasm , and having each paid admission fees of $1,500 and flown from places like California , Utah , Minnesota and Maine , clearly took Real Time seriously . Pausing for a skim latte at a neighborhood Starbucks , one man even called it a religious experience . <p> Mr. Reich gave the conference 's first lecture and after a few jokes  --  " As you can see , four years in the President 's Cabinet wore me down , " said Mr. Reich , who is famously not a tall man . " I used to be 6 feet 2 inches ! "  --  spoke seriously about the challenge of the global economy and the Year 2000 computer problem . <p> At times the proceedings bordered on the surreal . Mr. Reich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artificial hips were an allegory for global trade  --  they were designed in France , produced in Germany and implanted in the United States . Or the scene at Tip 's Big Room of hundreds of otherwise professional-looking attendees drinking Hurricanes ( a New Orleans specialty ) and gyrating to " The Mardi Gras Mambo . " <p> But it did not seem to matter to the Fast Company editors , whose readership is indeed growing . The magazine  --  which was introduced with the publication of 100,000 copies  --  will guarantee a rate base of 305,000 in January . Its ad sales appear robust . In 1996 , the first year of publication , 394 ad pages brought in $3,031,280 in revenue , according to the Publishers Information Bureau . In 1997 , ad pages almost doubled to 696 , resulting in $7,095,578 in revenue . With this year 's August issue , the magazine switched from bi-monthly publication to monthly . <p> And for 1998 , Julian Lowin , the publisher of Fast Company , said that he expected to see $15 million in ad revenue . The Publishers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Mr. Lowin said that the last three months of the year would not only be monthly , but particularly rich with ads . <p> After the conference , Mr. Taylor said he had gleaned several ideas for articles . " You know , Fast Company is not The New Yorker , " he said , his voice hoarse from days of nonstop networking . " We 're not editors who can go off into a cave and think deep thoughts and come out with a profound message . We need to be out there , with our readers , talking to them , understanding them . " <p> And Mr. Webber said he did not mind the conference 's occasionally warm-and-fuzzy bent or its effect on the gravity with which readers or advertisers perceive the magazine . <p> " In the old world of business and management , it was all about ' check your emotions at the door , check your individuality at the door , ' " he said . " It was the world of the organization man . The new world is ' Bring it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're interested in zydeco , and you work at a software company , maybe there 's a way to integrate zydeco into a new software design . " <p> As for Mr. Zuckerman , he was not particularly interested in zydeco software . " I 'm just happy to be a passenger on their train , " he said . <p> Chart : " FAST COMPANY : A FIVE-STEP PROGRAM " The guiding principles of the Fast Company " community , " according to the co-founders of Fast Company magazine . Work is personal . Do n't put you personality away on a shelf . You 're in charge of your own career . Quit if you 're not happy . None of us is as smart as all of us . Use teamwork .
