LAST DECEMBER , just weeks before the PGA Tour opened for a new season of business , Davis Love III emerged from a brief getaway in the pine woods of south Georgia sporting a buzzcut hairdo and a week 's growth of beard . Tooling breezily around his adopted St. Simons Island home in his red Chevy pickup , Love appeared to relish his anonymity . " I think it 's the beard and the haircut , " he quips . " Nobody seems to realize it 's me under all of this . To tell the truth , there are times lately when I would n't mind having a disguise like this out on Tour . It could come in handy . " Love smiles wryly at the thought , but do n't get the man wrong . After 10 years and 10 wins on Tour , including a dazzling brush with immortality at last year 's Masters , a guy who 's nickname is " Slick , " because he 's anything but , has no interest in becoming a bearded recluse . On the contrary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the cusp of a stardom known to an elite fraternal order of his peers , guys with eponymous first names like Arnie , Jack , Greg , Fred , and both Nicks . For Love , a major championship win here or there could do the trick . A breakthrough year could make Davis Love III golf 's next superstar . That intriguing thought , Love admits , is merely tempered by the knowledge of what stardom has cost him-and the aforementioned others-to reach this threshold . " Success is really a two-edged sword , " he says . " You work so hard to get to the top of the golf world and then everything outside of the golf course seems to try and lure you away from the game . The irony is , nothing really can prepare you for what comes with winning-the way that kind of sudden big success can alter just about every aspect of your life . " Your work . Your play . The opportunities you get . The obligations you have . The time you get to spend with your family . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you differently : You 're not just a guy who can hit golf balls well ... you 're a celebrity . It brings new freedoms , but it also can wear you out if you do n't know how to handle it . " Photograph // Fred Allen , the great radio comic , once described a celebrity as someone who works all his life to become known , then spends his days wearing dark glasses so he is n't recognized . Love concedes the age of the Reluctant Superstar may have finally arrived . " I know younger guys on Tour who look at Greg Norman or Fred Couples or either of the Nicks Faldo and Price and see what they 've had to go through and ask themselves if it 's worth it , " Love says . " Do they really want to subject themselves and their families to everything good or bad that goes with that level of fame ? I 'm certain many do n't . You ca n't blame them . Everyone out here loves the game of golf and wants to win . Playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But winning exacts a toll and requires sacrifices from your family that are n't small . The truth is , there are only a few Jacks and Arnolds and Gregs who really seem to thrive on the mega-stardom . The rest of us have to learn from them . That 's all Love really meant , he says , when he remarked a few years ago , " If I get to be Greg Norman , somebody please stop me . " The remark , he says , was incorrectly portrayed as a swipe at Norman . On the contrary , Love says , he was merely expressing admiration for the way golf 's most magnetic figure-a man he considers his role model , to a large extent-manages to win big golf tournaments , cuts breathtaking deals , and somehow keeps both his game and his life in perspective . It 's a paradox and phenomenon other potential breakthrough players find themselves gently puzzling about , too . They would love to win the big ones , but fear the consequences of a sudden breakthrough that could shift the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private world . " If it happens gradually , an inch at a time , as in the case of Davis , most players can probably handle that transformation , " says Johnny Miller , whose career exploded between the years 1973 and 1976 and then , by his own admission , crashed and burned from fatigue and the pressure of trying to sustain stardom . " It 's when the breakthrough comes quickly that the problems arise . Success and fame and money become the tail that wags the dog , and the excitement can quickly turn to frustration . A lot of baggage comes with winning . Where much is given , much is expected . It 's really one of the great paradoxes of golf . Everyone wants a piece of you when you win big . And the nicest guys seem to suffer most . " " It may sound a little bit crazy , " says six-time winner Bill Glasson , " but I can honestly say I would n't want to win a whole lot of big tournaments because of the impact it might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife Courtney intentionally selected Stillwater , Oklahoma , as a place to raise their two children , he says , " because it 's the real world here and preserving the quality of life we have is the critical thing . Would winning big alter that ? Probably so . There 's so much money in the game now . " I like being just another daddy who picks his daughter up at soccer practice . I also like being the guy who wins an important golf tournament . Life is choices . Maybe you just ca n't have it both ways these days . " As Miller and others point out , the Tour is littered with the walking wounded who played brilliantly for a time and rode the wave of fame and fortune before fatigue or the weight of reality brought them crashing back to earth . No story illustrates the Reluctant Superstar dilemma perhaps as powerfully as that of Nick Price . Price followed up 1993 's brilliant Player-of-the-Year performance with six wins in 1994 , including two majors-before running out of gas and retreating to his family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For me , " Price says , " winning those majors was the realization of a childhood dream . The golf was the easy part . My confidence was soaring , so my game did , too . The hard part , I quickly discovered , was my life off the golf course . " I thought I was prepared for the flood of things that came with that kind of success , but I honestly was n't . I had no way to manage it all . I could have played corporate outings every day of the year , gone to 200 dinners , flown everywhere to make deals of some kind or another . " Price is widely regarded as one of the nicest guys on Tour-just the kind of bloke Miller says suffers most from the inability to say no to an increasingly demanding world outside the ropes . " These days , when you win like that , " Price muses , " everyone wants five or 10 minutes of your time . You do n't want to be rude , you do n't want to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and give everybody something . The problem is the golf world is so big now-there are so many business people , so many reporters-you can actually wake up and find that you 've given too much of yourself away . " That 's what happened to me . The more I won , the more I gave to things away from the golf course , and the more my family life and game suffered as a result . The other stuff took away from practice time . The less I practiced , the worse I played . When I failed to play well , my desire to play decreased . It can give you some long nights . " I finally had to leave the Tour for a bit and rest . I have grown reluctant . Not about winning-but about what comes with it . I had to learn to manage my success and to say no for my own preservation . " To a lesser extent , Ernie Els braced for the impact on his life following his U.S. Open win at Oakmont in the summer of 1994 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his life was n't thrown under the same kind of microsc6pe. tI gdi a lot of attention but not as much as I expected , " he says . " That may have been because I am not from America . When Phil Mickelson or Davis Love wins a major , on the other hand , the demand is going to be enormous . I frankly look at guys like Norman and Price and wonder how they do it . " Down the road in the LPGA locker room , you 'll find similar long thoughts of reluctant stardom . Consider the existential doubts of the Tour 's hottest player of late , Sweden 's Annika Sorenstam , a blue-eyed blond who seems almost too good to be true . Sorenstam followed up her Rolex Rookie-of-the-Year honor in 1994 by capturing six tournaments and the U.S. Women 's Open in ' ' 95 . Among other feats , the engaging 25-year-old topped the money lists of two continents and carted home the Vare Trophy for low scoring average . But.she also stayed home for weeks after her Open breakthrough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every waking moment . Bedded down with a book called Learn How To Say No , the hottest Swede to hit American shores since Ingrid Bergman did n't appear at a tournament in the United States again until mid-September . And she skipped the first three events of the 1996 season , including the Chrysler-Plymouth Tournament of Champions . Love got a taste of this bittersweet fruit himself in 1992 when he and Couples spent the year doing a brilliant pas des deux atop the Tour money list . Love won three times and wound up second banana on the list to Couples , perhaps , in retrospect , a blessing in disguise . Couples , who also won three events-including The Masters , his first and only major-got the brunt of the attention , but both men 's lives exploded like novas and neither one , by their own admissions , handled the pressure particularly well . With a marriage publicly unraveling and a back beginning to seriously ache , Couples became a man on the run from an increasingly voracious press corps , at times appearing to resent the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made on his life . His game soured , his back went out-not to mention his enthusiasm for playing . " I 'd almost go so far as to say he willed his back to go out , " muses Miller . " I saw what Fred was going through and it was n't very encouraging , " recalls Love . " He was very frustrated . I may have handled it a bit better-but not much . " Love 's own game hit a slump when , concomitant with his success , dramas in his private life intensified to a new level of discomfiture . Love and his wife Robin had always enjoyed the slow-paced lifestyle of St. Simons Island , where both grew up and attended high school . The house they built on Sea Island Club 's Retreat nine faced the island 's main drag . After his sensational year in ' ' 92 , though , their home became one of the island 's leading tourist sites . Strangers stopped by at all hours and rang the doorbell , left notes , and took pictures . Worried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Loves raised a fence around their property . Fans climbed the fence . They planned a move to a quieter part of the island . Unwanted visitors were mere inconvenience compared to what came next . " Because of my success , " Davis recalls with a rueful shake of his head . " people who should have known better started saying some hurtful things-things which made our family life tough for a while . " The worst was a rumor that found its way to the Tour locker rooms that said Robin Love was being investigated for using drugs . The rumor was , of course , false and its origin proved to be an offhand comment from a casual acquaintance at a local fitness center . Driving along , Love lights up one of the few visible indulgences of budding superstardom-a Cuban cigarand puffs thoughtfully on it for a bit , then smiles a half-smile . " The good side of achieving your dream of becoming one of the best players in the world , " he muses , " is the tremendous respect you get from your peers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way as a result of what you 've done . The bad side is , your life becomes a kind of moving target . " Ben Crenshaw , who beat Love at last year 's Masters , knows exactly what Love is talking about . His perspective on this issue is unique . In 1984 , he won his first major , The Masters-immediately after which his game took a precipitous nosedive . Within two years , he pulled up out of his free fall and was once again playing top-10 golf-this time , he says , a whole lot wiser . A decade later , he won again at Augusta . During this same period of time , the golf world at large experienced its own version of the Big Bang Theory . For better or worse , Crenshaw believes the explosive popularity of golf in the past decade dramatically transformed every aspect of the professional game-the stars , the fans , the sponsors , the prize money , and endorsement deals circulating in and out of the game , and perhaps most of all the people watching the stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember the late Clifford Roberts 's concern that huge purses would ultimately spell the demise of The Masters and other major championships . When he won at Augusta in ' ' 84 , there were no million-dollar purses anywhere , and the PGA Tour was a thriving little $20 million enterprise . When he donned his second green jacket 11 years later , The Masters purse was chugging toward the $2 million mark , and the PGA Tour was three times its 1984 size , with a global reach that included 18 Tournament Players Clubs , shops and resorts , a publishing arm , and its own bank credit card . " It kind of takes your breath away , growth like that , " Crenshaw admits . " During that time , " says Rocky Hambric of Cornerstone Sports , who has been an agent since the late ' ' 70s and represents Corey Pavin , Phil Mickelson , and several other top pros , " the golf world broadened and deepened dramatically . Television coverage tripled . The size of the press coverage probably grew five or six times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nicklaus , Miller , and Trevino , we suddenly had the emergence of a host of talented young players-Norman , Strange , Azinger , Payne Stewart , Pavin , and several others . With deeper fields , you did n't need an Arnie or Jack to make or break a tournament . " You suddenly had 20 guys who could win every week . This three- or four-fold increase in stars increased fan interest tremendously , which , in turn , attracted corporate America and greater television exposure . Golf is the sport of business . It 's spiraled upward from there . The endorsement deals flew into the stratosphere , the opportunities became essentially unlimited . " The golf boom of the past decade and the arrival of million dollar purses , says Hambric , forever altered the landscape of the game . " It came upon golf so fast , and it meant you could suddenly make a lot more money but also increased the danger you could burn out your guy by chasing dollars . The wiser players have learned to be reluctant-but the phenomenon is still recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes , players must now contend with a large , diverse press corps that does n't treat players with the kid gloves their predecessors used with Palmer and Nicklaus . John Morris , vice president of communications for the PGA Tour , cites some of the media 's coverage of the 1995 Ryder Cup as a prime example of why many top players are rapidly becoming disenchanted with the coverage their game receives-and becoming increasingly reluctant to open up . " Some of the attacks on Curtis Strange and Lanny Wadkins sounded almost like personal attacks on their integrity rather than honest attempts to explain what happened or portray the event for what it was-a stunning win by the Europeans , " Morris says . " It turned into a nasty namecalling thing . In some quarters , gossip has become news-and it 's treated as such .... Believe me , the players are getting weary of that sort of thing . " Back in 1984 , Crenshaw agrees , " It really was like the quiet before the storm . You had Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus and that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You also had far fewer people writing about the game , and you saw the same guys week to week sitting in the locker room . You could sit and have a talk and feel confident that what you said would be honestly and properly conveyed . Today , I 'm sorry to say , that kind of trust and intimate quality does n't exist anymore . " A couple of years ago , as a by-product of the boom , the Tour realized it had a growing problem-autograph seekers who would follow a player into the Porta-John to collect his signature . This year is seeing the regular appearance of the Tour-sanctioned autograph tent . " It 's difficult for the players to accept , " says Love , a member of the Tour 's Policy Board , " because it seems to go against the grain of golf 's openness . On the other hand , it was probably inevitable because the growth of golf has brought a different kind of fan into the game . " There was a time when the only people who came out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percentage seem to be celebrity watching-looking for a Greg Norman or Fred Couples . I do n't mind signing autographs , but I do n't like the aggressiveness I 've seen increasing . " In China at last year 's World Cup Matches , I literally told a lady I would punch her if she did n't get out of my way . She was screaming at me , pushing all these hats for me to sign under my nose . Can you imagine that ? People were pushing and shoving to get close to us . It has n't gotten like that in this country yet , but the behavior of some of the fans makes you think it could . " Golf will be on the same level as football or baseball , where fans boo players and throw things on the field . " Love knows that if his career gets to be anything close to Norman 's someday , the rewards will be large but the demand just as immense . " Norman has the most recognizable face in golf , " Love says . " Would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to win the way he has ? Yes . That 's the challenge . To find the balance that 's right for me . " And what does golf 's most famous face have to say on the subject ? Does he ever get tired of being , well , Greg Norman ? Growing a beard probably would n't help him a bit . " No , I do n't get tired of it , " Norman says with a laugh before growing contemplative . " But that 's probably only because I wanted it to be this way . I 've enjoyed what 's been put on my plate , and I 've been fortunate enough to determine my own fate , in many respects , because I wanted these transformations to occur . " In ' ' 87 or ' ' 88 I stopped and took a look at myself and I thought about Arnold and Jack and realized they 'd done something nobody else really had . I set out to transform myself to try and reach their level , to improve my game and the quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I had my family 's complete support . I 'm very open with them about all of this-the good as well as the bad that goes with any success . It was something I really wanted . " It 's a compliment when people regard you as a superstar . But I can now look at the Tour and actually see guys-some very fine players , mind you-who do n't want what I 've achieved . They do n't want it and that 's their choice . " They want to play for the pleasure of playing , to make some money and have some fun . You can almost see it in their eyes . There 's room enough for everybody out there . " Ironically , Norman says he 's seen this wary look in his own son 's eyes . Norman likes to tell the story of how he once returned from a tournament and invited his 9-yearold son Greg out into the backyard to chip balls . " I 'm always talking to my kids about if they 're okay with what their father 's up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , " Norman relates . Greg Jr. , a sports-mad kid whose hero is Wayne Gretzky , told his famous father he really did n't want to chip balls and " be a successful golfer like you , Daddy , because of how hard you work and how much time you spend away from home . " The remark struck a powerful chord in Norman . " It was very astute , " the most famous face in golf says simply . " I loved him for his honesty and I do n't blame him a bit for saying that .
