Section : MUTUAL FUND MONITOR <p> * Is it too late to buy into biotech funds ? * Investment trends and top-performing funds <p> The one-year returns of biotechnology and health-science funds are sizzlers . They 've grabbed the top seven places in this month 's sector-fund category . Almost every sector fund has its day in the sun , but the biotech bunch has been a standout since 1989 . That , notes editor Sheldon Jacobs of No-Load Fund Investor newsletter , is unusual . Shareholders of Vanguard 's Specialized Health Care Portfolio were recently warned by Vanguard chairman John Bogle that the fund 's total returns over the past one , three and five years are unlikely to be matched again . As with any fund whose assets are concentrated in one industry , the Vanguard fund can be expected to be more volatile than a broadly diversified equity portfolio . " Simply put , " says Bogle , " the risk of loss is greater . " <p> GO-SLOW SIGNS . Subscribers to Medical Technology Stock Letter have also been warned about risk , particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We believe you 're better off buying stocks on dips at this stage . " <p> Such advice has n't stopped investors from throwing money into the funds . When fifth-ranked Oppenheimer Global Biotechnology announced it was shutting the door to new investors , cash flooded in so fast that assets jumped from $50 million ( the point at which portfolio manager Ken Oberman says he wanted to close the fund ) to $70 million . Result : 35% of fund assets are in cash , and Oberman is loath to plunge that money into more biotech issues just yet . His biggest holdings : Amgen ( a gain of 370% since purchase ) and Ecogen ( up 164% for the fund ) . <p> WHAT TO DO NOW . Is it too late to buy ? Jacobs thinks so , and the weight of expert opinion seems to agree that caution is in order . Not necessarily , replies John Kaweske , manager of Financial Strategic 's Health Sciences Portfolio : " The long-term investor should absolutely invest in this industry . " Kaweske cites three reasons for his enthusiasm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 12% of all Americans today to 22% by 2030 ) ; the huge sums currently being spent on research and development ; and the mounting consumer demand for new treatments and diagnostic tools . <p> Demand for what 's newest leads Kaweske to believe that as health care consumes a bigger portion of the gross national product , pressure to reduce costs will mount . He has put 25% of assets into the cost-containment niche . One stock he thinks epitomizes the potential of this theme is Diagnostek . The Albuquerque-based mail-order-drug retailer recently signed on to supply the million-plus members of the Teamsters Union . TABLE <p> Figures as of April 23  --  May 1 . TABLE <p> Figures as of April 23  --  May 1 . TABLE HOW TO USE THESE TABLES <p> STOCK FUNDS . Volatility Ranking measures variations in the rate of total return relative to al other funds over the previous three years , An asterisk means that a fund is not three years old , and that its volatility score may not be comparable with those of other funds .
