Contents* * * # THIRD FORM , WINTER TERM , 1978 <p> With the school year about to begin again , here now is a story about a British public school and one exceptional student . Ben Jeapes is himself a graduate of such a school ( " public " schools in England are roughly the equivalent of private schools in the U.S. ) and reports that he had trouble taking the establishment seriously when he discovered that the chorus of the school song celebrates King Edward VI ( now deceased roughly four and a half centuries ) . Here in the Twentieth Century , Ben Jeapes edits scientific journals in Oxford and has published stories in Interzone , Aboriginal Science Fiction , and various anthologies . <p> Tom 's arrival in my life was preceded by the sound of his mother . <p> It was a sunny September weekend and most of our year had already arrived at our new school ; we had shaken off our parents and were unpacking our trunks in the dormitory , casting covert glances at our neighbors or making shy conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known who we were . Good little public schoolboys , the future administrators of a dead empire ; diehard Conservatives , sworn enemies of Callaghan 's Labour government . Two months beforehand we were kings at prep school and the pinnacle of maturity was the grand age of thirteen . Now we were little boys again , dwarfed even by the mountainous fourteen-year-olds in the year above us . We were longing for an object on which to vent our new-found insecurity , and then the Meltons arrived . <p> We heard Mrs. Melton coming down the corridor and suspended our unpacking to listen better : " Is this the way ? Does n't anyone know anything ? You , are you a prefect ? Can you direct us to Thomas 's dormitory ? " <p> She was a brassy woman in a fur coat , who glided in like visiting royalty while two conscripted fifth-formers struggled behind her with a trunk . Absorbed in this spectacle , it took an effort to notice the small , redhaired figure in his mother 's wake : misery incarnate , in a too-big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Mrs. Melton stalked about the dormitory , squinting at the nameplates above each bed , and homed in on the bed next to mine . " Here it is . Put the trunk there , will you ? " <p> She turned to her son . <p> " Well , dear , I 'll be off so you can settle in . Be good . " She gave his cheek a quick peck and looked around . Her eyes settled on me . " This is your neighbor  --  " she peered at my nameplate "  --  William Sutton . William , this is Thomas . Remember everything I told you , Thomas . Ask a prefect if you need anything and if anyone offers you a cigarette go straight to the housemaster . " That line sealed her son 's fate . " Are you coming to see me off ? " <p> We all realized , the two fifth-formers included , that we were staring at Tom , who followed after his mother with his face a flaming red that matched his hair . The fifth-formers tactfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom 's return . <p> 9:30 pm , Day One of term . Bed time for little boys . The ribbing had eased off and we were still sorting out who would be the leaders of the year , who the followers of the leaders , and who would be more or less independent . This last group had two sub-categories  --  acceptable and unacceptable . I knew from experience that my big ears would exclude me from the first group unless I showed a lot more bravado than I had in me ; the best course was to lie low and hope no one noticed me . I therefore found myself in the second group , kidding myself that this was in fact acceptable independence . Tom , because no one else would dare take him , found himself squarely in the third , independence quite unacceptable . <p> I did n't have the heart for the prolonged persecution campaign that the far end of the dormitory had set themselves on ( several voices had already broken up that end , which gave them a head start in the maturity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I decided to do my bit . Tom was curled up in his bed , nose buried in a book . <p> " Hi , " I said . No answer . " Thomas ? " <p> ( " Tha-maas ! " came a cry from the far end , in the tone used by the woman in Tom and lefty when the cat has just wrecked the house again . ) <p> He glared back at me . <p> " Tom , " he said , and turned back to his book . <p> " Oh , sorry . " Tom , eh ? I had always been William , even to my friends . Time to grow up . " I 'm Will , " I said . <p> " Oh . " <p> I resented this treatment : maybe no one else had seen the teddy bear he had almost taken out of his trunk , but I had and I had n't said a word . <p> " Good book ? " I asked . He held it up  --  The Spy Who Loved Me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the film ? " The latest epic to feature O1 ' Eyebrows had come out the previous year . <p> ( " Want a cigarette ? " someone called . " If anyone offers you a cigarette , go straight to the housemaster , " someone else answered , falsetto . ) <p> " It 's far better , " he said loftily . " It 's a proper love story . It does n't have any submarines or undersea bases . " <p> " Not even a Lotus ? " I asked hopefully . <p> " ' Fraid not . " <p> ( " Hey , Melton ! You queer ? " " That 's it ! He 's bent ! " " Move your bed away from him , Sutton ! " ) <p> " Is there any ... you know ? " I said , even more hopefully . <p> " There is a bit , actually , " he admitted , with a bashful grin . He showed me a couple of choice passages , of which between us we understood about half , and we chatted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prefect came in to turn the lights out at 10 o'clock we were 0.1 of the way toward being friends . <p> Winter , 1978 . Another generation of schoolboys navigated its way by instinct through the tricky passages of adolescence ; selfish , arrogant prigs without a care in the world beyond proving our maturity . A boy 's worth was judged by his prowess in sport and his body 's testosterone count . You sank or swam , which meant you grew up fast . There was no point in running to Mummy because Mummy was n't there and Matron , lovely lady that she was , was n't quite the same . Outside our artificial , unreal environment the country suffered the Winter of Discontent . Margaret Thatcher would be the nation 's salvation . James Callaghan was a Communist ( no one was too sure what a socialist was ) . Liberals were all bent . <p> Tom Melton could do nothing right . He was small and his fair skin made him look even younger than he was . His voice refused to break , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choir to get away from this stigma , in vainl . He had an accent so refined that even we noticed . He liked reading books and he played a musical instrument ( the clarinet , and well  --  he was a Music Scholar ) . He was a sensitive , emotional boy and he was targeted for destruction . <p> We were placed in the same form , where his unpopularity and my cultivated nebbishness drew us together and we moved from shy liking to proper friendship . Since anyone who failed to come up to scratch was tagged as bent or queer ( " gay " had n't entered our lexicon yet ) , we both acquired the label . I did sometimes wonder , in the way that adolescents do , but since the sight of Tom in the shower did nothing for me I decided the others were wrong . <p> Half term came and went , and Tom refused to talk about it . I imagined a week alone with Mrs. Melton and sympathized . I had learnt , to my fascination , that his parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though Daddy paid the bills . His father , an unspecified businessman , had left for another woman . I still had n't got used to the idea that adults ( especially parents ) had sex even when they did n't want children . <p> The second half of term was much like the first , and then the threat of the holidays loomed . After his reaction to half term , I could guess how he felt about four whole weeks at home . <p> " Come and stay with us , " I invited , after consulting with my parents up in Hereford . His face split into the biggest grin I had seen . <p> " Can I ? How long ? " <p> " As long as you like , really . " <p> Mrs. Melton did n't give in without a fight but we got Tom for the week before Christmas , at the cost of my spending a week with the Meltons in the new year . <p> THIRD FORM , SPRING TERM , 1979 <p> One term down , fourteen to go . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school he loathed . I had mentioned his unpopularity to my father , who shrugged . He had been through the system himself thirty years previously . <p> " He 'll have to learn to cope , " he had said with rough sympathy . " And you can stand up for your friend , ca n't you , son ? <p> " Well ... <p> " Of course , " I said quickly . Dad shrugged . <p> " So there you are . Perhaps things will get better when his voice breaks . " <p> This happy day was still a way off when things changed . <p> The true bane of Tom 's life was a boy called Stephen Gale . Perhaps because he never quite made it at anything : he was n't quite good enough for the team , he was n't quite accepted as a leader of our year . Older boys smirked slightly when they spoke to him . The main reason for his general unpleasance I did n't learn until later , but all these little things piled up and made him an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spring term , and whenever Gale found himself near Tom on the field his stick always managed to catch itself around Tom 's ankle and send him flying . On this day he was spotted by the umpire and given a ticking off in public , which only made him worse . <p> We got back from games and showered . Gale turned Tom 's hot tap off when Tom was n't looking and tripped him up when he tried to leave . I came out of the showers a few minutes later to find Tom sitting by his locker with his towel still round his waist . His face was buried in his hands and his shoulders were shaking . <p> " Tom ? " I said . He jerked his head up and the vicious hatred in his look make me take a step back . " Fuck off ! " he hissed . <p> " Hey , Tom , it 's me , " I said . I noticed the tears in his eyes and heard the rattle in his throat . He was trying very , very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like you , Tom , " I said . <p> " I do n't give a fuck . " Two fucks in ten seconds was definitely not like Tom . He hugged his knees and his voice still shook . <p> " I 've had enough . I hate this place , I hate this life , I ... " He broke off with a choke . " I 'm going to flip , Will . I really am . I am going to flip . " <p> I toweled myself dry quietly , got dressed and went to lounge in the third form dayroom , waiting for afternoon lessons to start . <p> Tom came in shortly after me . He seemed to have got himself under control . <p> " It 's the queer boy ! " <p> Tom ignored Gale . He went to his locker , took out a book , sat down and started reading . His ears were burning despite the show he put on . <p> " Hey , did you hear ? Melton thought he had a pubic hair , until he peed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tom 's ears burnt brighter and he studied the book even more fixedly . To my surprise , I found myself flushing and I buried my nose further in the work I was doing . There was going to be a fight and that wanker Gale was going to bully my friend again . Oh shit oh shit oh shit . <p> Shut up , Gale , just shut up ! Not Oscar Wilde , but it would serve . It probably would shut him up , too , if only out of surprise . And I would be his next target . No thanks . <p> " Is it a nice book , Tommy ? Ooh , I do hope Mummy would approve . " Gale grabbed the book and held it up above him . <p> " Give it back , please , " Tom groaned . Gale danced away with the book held up in the air . Tom jumped up , shouting , " Do n't  --  " <p> He froze . I could see his face : his expression went blank for a moment and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , queer boy ! " Gale shouted , knocking Tom away . Tom fell over backward and landed in a sprawl . He shook his head and slowly climbed to his feet again . <p> " You all right , Melton ? " one of the braver boys asked . Gale glared at him . <p> Tom smiled : it was the creepiest thing I had ever seen because there was a most un-Tomlike glint in his eye . <p> " Ah , yes , Gale . The original cock-sucker . " <p> Gale stood stunned and his cheeks reddened at the burst of laughter . This had to be revenged . He stood over Tom , using his height to dominate . <p> " Listen , queer boy  --  " <p> " Oh do be quiet , Stevie-poos , " Tom pouted and minced at him . " You 'll make Evans jealous . " <p> Evans ? Evans was the captain of the Firsts and surely as straight as they come . Could n't Tom have picked a better target ? <p> But Gale was gaping , mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to Tom and looming over him . <p> " One last chance , Melton  --  " <p> " One last chance , Melton , " Tom mimicked perfectly . " Go squeeze your zits , Gale . " <p> Gale 's hand shot out  --  <p> Tom 's grabbed it and pulled Gale into a tight embrace . Gale bellowed and writhed to escape , but somehow Tom was hanging on to him and seemed to be whispering in his ear . Gale stopped writhing and stared down at Tom in horror . Tom released him and Gale , white faced , took a step back . <p> " I ... you ... would n't ! " he gasped . <p> " Want a bet ? " Tom said evenly . Gale fled . <p> The rest of us were a frozen tableau , still awed by the extraordinary exchange . Tom seemed to have forgotten about us ; he stood still , looking at his hands , then down at the rest of his body . Then he , too , left . <p> I found him in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mirror . Not squeezing blackheads or zits , just looking . Sometimes he would move his head from side to side , never taking his eyes of his reflection . Then he saw my reflection behind him and turned round , grinning . <p> " Will . Hi , " he said , and put his hands on my shoulders . I was terrified he was going to pull me into an embrace too , but he just stood and took me in as though he had never seen me before . <p> " What was all that about , Tom ? " I said . <p> " Hmm ? Oh , Gale , yes . I just mentioned a couple of names , that 's all . I should n't have made fun of him . " He smiled and actually put an arm round my shoulders , for all the world like a big brother . " He wo n't bully anyone again , that 's what counts . I 've done him a favor , really , ' cos now he 's going to have to learn to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all it took . Tom did n't want universal popularity , just to be left alone , and it worked . He could live his life his way and when it suited him he could be on good terms with anyone . He was not a violent boy and he despised bullies . He remained independent of cliques , but now it was the acceptable form of independence . He was open to everyone ; he could mix with anyone if he so chose , and if he wanted to he could have been a leader of the year in his own right . <p> One of the boys he could have led was Stephen Gale , who now practically worshipped his footsteps . Funny old world . <p> With the Easter holidays on the horizon , I thought we should make arrangements for visiting again . <p> " We 're going to Scotland for the week before Easter , " I said , " but we could squeeze you in any other time . " <p> " Ah ... yes , " Tom said . " Will , would you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean , do come and stay with us , I 'd really like that , but I want to be with my mother . " <p> " What ? " <p> He smiled and shrugged sheepishly . <p> " She 's lonely , Will . Dad 's treated her like shit and she deserves a bit more than she 's getting from her only child . " <p> " Then why did she send you here ? " I demanded . <p> " Because , my dear , one does , " he said in his best Noel Coward . In his own voice , he went on , " It would never occur to her not to . Her family have been going to public school since 1066 and the stiff upper lip 's been genetically inbred . I 'm going to change all that . " <p> " Yeah ? " <p> " Yeah . Look , give me your diary . " <p> I handed it over and he riffled through April . <p> " When do you get back from Scotland ? The sixteenth ? Fine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... say , come on the seventeenth , and see for yourself . " <p> Both Meltons were waiting for me at the station and Mrs. Melton swooped on me . <p> " William ! How nice to see you again . " She kissed me . She kissed me ! I could see Tom grinning over her shoulder . She was smiling and animated and as she drove us back to the house , a vast palace in the gin-and-Jaguar heartland of deepest Surrey , she chatted about all the lovely things she and Tom had been doing over the holidays . When she left us in my room it was a relief . Tom was still grinning . He sat in a chair and let me unpack . <p> " You 've drugged her food , have n't you ? " <p> " I 've been nice to her , that 's all . " <p> " ' We 've done so many lovely things , Thomas and I  --  " <p> " Fancy coming up to London this evening ? " he said , changing the subject . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the local nightlife  --  at least for two boys of fourteen who were n't really sure what a good time was anyway  --  left a lot to be desired . <p> " There 's a girl I 've been seeing , and she 's got a sister  --  " <p> " Yeah , yeah . " I stopped unpacking and looked at him . He was serious . <p> " Do n't tell me , it 's your baby cousins , right ? " <p> " Will ! No , Maria 's sixteen , and Alice is fourteen , same as you . " <p> I must have gone pale . The thought of girls  --  real girls  --  was terrifying . Tom hooted with laughter . <p> " You 're scared ! " He ran over to the window and shouted out of it , " He 's scared  --  " " Tom ! " <p> " Ah , relax . " He turned back to me . " You 'll hang on to your virginity for a few more years . " <p> " Tom ! " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls . We 'll go up after tea , right ? " <p> My toes still curl at the memory of my fears . It was a totally innocent evening . Maria and Alice were the daughters of a friend of Tom 's father ; they were good looking , intelligent and thoroughly pleasant to be with . We met up in Leicester Square , went to see Superman and afterward went to their home in Kensington for dinner . Just the four of us , and when their parents came home we had a couple more drinks and the party broke up . <p> It was still the first time I 'd talked to a girl other than my sister  --  yuk !  --  or one of her friends  --  yuk !  --  for years ; certainly the first time since girls had become something more to me than inferior imitations of boys , flat all the way down , to be avoided and despised . Alice and I circled each other like a couple of teenagers on a first date , which is exactly what we were , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company . Just before setting off to catch the tube we managed a quick , shy kiss , and it was like heaven . <p> I had been much too absorbed in Alice to think of how Tom was getting on with the sixteen-year-old Maria , much less wonder about how he had managed to bridge the age difference so effectively . There is a lot more than two years between a sixteen-year-old girl and a fourteen-year old boy . On the train back , it occurred to me to comment in as tangential a manner as possible . <p> Tom grinned and gave his one comment on the subject . <p> " It 's company I 'm after , not sex , Will , " he said , " and that 's just a question of knowing the right words . " <p> FOURTH FORM , WINTER TERM , 1979 <p> Tom and I finished our first year as the closest and best of friends and made arrangements to keep in touch over the summer holidays . When we returned for the fourth form we had progressed from the dayroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inevitably we shared together . <p> This was more like it ! A year older , several inches taller and much , much wiser than the previous Autumn , and ( best of all ) one step up the maturity ladder from the new third form . We had passed through the worst traumas and adjustments that adolescence could throw at us and we were n't so worried about flaunting our heterosexuality at all and sundry , but again I began to wonder about myself . Had Alice ( who I had n't seen since ) been just a flash in the pan ? I was the only really close friend that Tom had ; he seemed to make a deliberate effort to seek out my friendship , which I found flattering , but ... I put it down to the fact that I had been his friend even before his volte-face the previous year . <p> But even so ... <p> I plucked up my courage one evening to tell him my fears , in the privacy of our study with no one else about , and he laughed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . He was the first person I knew to use that word , and he said it with such conviction that I was paradoxically hurt . <p> " How do you know ? " I demanded , and bit my tongue when I realized how I sounded . <p> " You 're not , " he repeated . He turned back to his work , then looked up again . " Gale is . " " Gale ? " <p> " Sure . What made him such a dork was that he was terrified of anyone finding out and so he had to act like he thought a strapping hetero should . He 'll come ... I mean , I would n't be surprised if he came out at university . In fact ... " He looked about , as though afraid of eavesdroppers , though no one else could be in the same room . " ... in fact , and if you repeat this to anyone else you die , you remember Evans ? " <p> " Yeah . " Our school 's rugby hero had left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I happen to know that he and Gale ... well , did it , as t'were , last year . Or rather , Gale had it done to him , and found he liked it . And he has , so to speak , done it with a couple of other boys too . And I 'm not just talking adolescents tossing each other off , I 'm talking the whole hog . " <p> " No ! " I was shocked , horrified , fascinated , and I wanted to know everything . It did n't occur to me to doubt him . " How do you know ? " <p> " Because he ... has told me . And , no Will , I 'm not telling you who the others are . You 'd refuse to go in the showers with them if you knew . " <p> There was a look in his eye  --  a cold look , as if he was challenging me to disbelieve him , and I did n't dare . <p> " You sound as if you do n't mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He seemed to muse on it . " I suppose I mind sixth formers buggering third formers , but on the other hand , why fight what 's inevitable ? " <p> " I ca n't believe it ! " <p> " It 's understandable , " he said . " These are the most potent years of our life , Will , did you know that ? You and I should be out there spreading our seed about and instead we 're here with nowhere to spread it except each other . " <p> This conjured up an image so revolting that it was n't difficult to push it away . Without looking up from his work , Tom carried on : " And we 're cooped up here with nothing but other boys for company , if we 're seen talking to a girl it 's regarded as subversive and unnatural , and they 're surprised when places like this get a reputation as hotbeds of buttocks and buggery . You wait ' til I 'm dictator , Will . The public school system will bum . It serves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of their lives . " <p> " So  --  " I said , but there was no stopping him now . <p> " Anyone who has ever sent an adolescent to a single sex boarding school will be forcibly confined in a room with members of whichever gender they would least like to shag , and pumped full of hormones until they feel they 'll burst if they do n't have it off with someone . Let them see how they like it . " <p> " I do n't understand you , Tom . " <p> He looked up at me and gave that grin again . His usual confidence . <p> " You will . " <p> FIFTH FORM , SPRINT TERM , 1981 <p> In the fifth form , I got expelled . <p> Toward the middle of the year , with " O " level exams looming , the school was hit by a drinking spree . Getting paralytic was the trendy thing to do . <p> When , for three weekends running , boys had been hospitalized for alcohol poisoning , the headmaster made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to be an expulsion offense . That was all . <p> Two boys from our year were expelled a fortnight later , for just that crime . Tom , in public , was as shocked as the rest of us . Privately , he was disdainful . <p> " Boys will be boys , " he said . I was angry . <p> " Does n't it bother you ? " I demanded . " Just for a little drink  --  " <p> " If they did n't want to go , " he said , " all they had to do was not get drunk . And as for getting into intensive care , nearly getting yourself killed , using up a good hospital bed which someone deserving might need ... " Then he grabbed my shoulders and looked me straight in the eyes . <p> " Will , promise me now , you 'll never , ever be so stupid , right ? " <p> " Well , I ... I mean ... " I stammered . <p> " Promise ! " <p> " Sure , I promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd never been drunk in my life and I was n't a rebel . I did n't go out of my way to break the rules . <p> Then I had more important things on my mind , like " O " levels . I 'd first heard of these mystical institutions when I was eight , which meant I had been dreading them for half my life . The crucial bits of paper that would affect the rest of my time on this world . Never mind your degree or your " A " levels or even just practical experience  --  without a good crop of " O " s , no prospective employer will even look at you . When you 've had that hammered into you for half of your existence , getting through them is worth celebrating . <p> Which a group of us did , with a couple of bottles of whisky . Do n't ask me where it came from . I just remember being flattered by the invitation to join a group of the lads who had got the magical fluid from somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drank it . <p> Choose your friends . I passed out first and they left me there . <p> I was woken up by Tom , shaking me . <p> " Will ! Will , for fuck 's sake , Will ! " He slapped me , hard , and it did n't hurt a bit . He was muttering to himself , something like : <p> " Too late , Melton , too fucking late  --  " <p> The fact that this was the first time in ages that I had seen Tom worked up about anything , or even swearing , failed to register . I looked blearily up at both of him and burst out laughing . <p> " I 'm pissed ! " I squealed , and fell onto my back , quivering with mirth . It was the funniest thing ever . <p> " Will , you berk , " he said more softly , and pulled me to my feet . He supported me back to the house . " <p> Wha'going ? " I demanded . <p> " Back to the study for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not going to find you . He 's not . " <p> " The housemaster ! " I called . " Hello , Bugsy ! I 've ... hee , hee , hee , I 've had a whole bottle ... " I collapsed laughing again , dragging Tom down . <p> He got me to the study with the help of a passing third former . The kettle had just boiled . <p> " Drink , " he ordered , thrusting a cup of coffee into my hands . I sipped it reluctantly . <p> " Tastes soapy , " I objected . <p> " That 's because you 're pissed . Finish it . " I shrugged and did as he said . " Still soapy . " <p> He looked thoughtful . <p> " It could be the shampoo , of course , " he said . <p> I finished throwing up an hour later , it took a day for the retching to die down . During that time , Tom was more agitated than he had ever been . He could n't sit still but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three boys I 'd been with was in hospital , intensive care . The other two , apparently , had n't been caught . <p> So what was the problem ? I was sober , no one had seen me , it was a day later , and anyway , friends do n't rat on friends , do they ? <p> The long hand of the housemaster , Mr. Buckingham  --  Bugsy  --  caught up with me at tea time the next day . I was summoned to his study . <p> " You 've heard about Langton ? " <p> " Um  --  yes , sir , " I said , trying to sound puzzled . Langton was the hospital case . <p> " He 's named names , Sutton . " <p> I gulped ; Buckingham scowled at me . " Morgan , Robson and ... you . I know you 're not a troublemaker and I think I can trust you . So I 'll ask you to your face . Were you drinking yesterday ? " Oh , please ! All I had to say was  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit askance , just a bit too carefully . I lowered my head . <p> " Yes , sir , " I said . He nodded . <p> " I 'm glad you said that , Sutton , because that 's what Morgan said too . " Was there sympathy in his look ? " I 'll see what I can do with the headmaster because I do n't think you deserve expulsion , but do n't hold your breath . " <p> I had never seen Tom so upset . He seemed to fold in on himself as though all his strength had left him ; as though he had been hit by a terrible tragedy . <p> " But it 's not so bad , " I said foolishly . " He 's going to speak up for me , they wo n't sack me for one offense  --  <p> " He was almost in tears . <p> " They will , they will . I 'm so sorry , Will ! I tried to get to you in time , I really did , I tried to change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get away ... I 'm sorry ! " When he looked up there were tears in his eyes . He seemed so convinced of my fate that I began to believe it too , despite all my desperate optimism to the contrary . <p> " You were n't to know , Tom ! I mean , I was stupid ... " <p> " You were , " he agreed . We held each other 's gaze . <p> " Thank you for sobering me up , " I said eventually . <p> " A pleasure . " <p> " You do n't seem surprised . " <p> " No . " <p> I was silent for a bit more . Then  --  <p> " You really think they 'll throw me out ? " <p> " Yup . " <p> And they did . <p> We stayed in touch , of course , and still exchanged visits during the holidays . His last words to me as a co-pupil of the same school were : <p> " If you had a choice , I 'd advise you to go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place has done . But since you do n't , I expect you 'll be sent to somewhere just like this . " <p> I was ; the only real difference was the lack of Thomas Melton about the place . All the other characters were there , with different names . And now I stood on the touchlines at matches and cheered my new school on against my old . <p> The sixth form , lower and upper , passed mostly in a blur . The world moved into 1989. with not a war cloud to be seen ; those who had heard of them at all thought that the Falkland Islands were off Scotland . <p> The Argie scum invaded , and we raged at the swine who invaded our sovereign territory and applauded the sending of the task force . It was a military-oriented school with a lot of officers ' sons , so a lot of fathers were sent down to the South Atlantic . Some were killed . <p> The world moved on . The upper sixth dawned and the end of my school days was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1983 , cruising on the Falklands factor . I was old enough to vote and gave mine to the fledgling Social Democrats . Three million unemployed were beginning to wear , even on my far-right conscience . <p> Back at the old place , Tom of course became a prefect . Not so for me  --  one thing I had carried with me to my new school was my determination not to be tied down by responsibility . The independence that I prided myself on manifested itself for the first time in an outright refusal to take on obligations . <p> " A " levels loomed ; we sat our prediction exams in the Easter term . On the strength of my predicted two As and a B , I was encouraged to try for Cambridge . Tom set his sights lower ; in those days you still had to stay on for an extra term to take the Oxbridge exam and Tom , in one of his letters , said he had no intention of staying incarcerated for a minute more than necessary . <p> Tom rung me the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about my disastrous three Cs . I did n't know what had gone wrong with me in the exam room . He had two Cs and a B. Reluctantly I turned to the shortlist which I had drawn up in the unlikely event of not making it to Cambridge , and we ended up at the same Midlands redbrick , back together again . I had forgotten how much of my life had depended simply on his presence about the place . It was good to have it once more . <p> Tom , to my surprise , eschewed maths  --  his strongest point - completely . Instead he did politics . Politics ! He looked almost apologetic . <p> " It 's a change of direction , " he admitted , " but so 's going to university , in my family . I thought of doing sociology , but I 'd be disinherited . " <p> FRESHERS ' YEAR , WINTER TERM , 1983 <p> University life was wonderful . I relished the new environment and gladly sloughed off all the old snobberies , the old prejudices , the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From being a despicable snob I became an equally despicable inverted snob . I could flatten my vowels and drop my aitches with the best of them . I experimented with growing long hair and a moustache ( " What will you do when you grow up , Will ? " Tom said ) but thickened out and reverted to normal the day before my parents came to visit . <p> Tom fell into the whole thing like a fish returning to water . He did n't change because he did n't need to . Tom Melton at almost nineteen was just the same as Tom Melton at fourteen  --  a mature , well balanced character at ease with the world . He knew he had nothing to prove and so never bothered trying to . <p> Another familiar face was Stephen Gale , of fond memory , whom I had actually found I could like . It 's amazing what a leveller just growing up can be . But it was still an eerie feeling when he nervously , and with an embarrassed smile , told me over a cup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he felt happier than ever before , I should n't feel offended but he did n't really fancy me ( " too gangly " ) , and could I think of a good way for him to break it to his parents ? <p> I fell in love with a dark-haired girl called Joanna Hughes , whom I met through Tom ( she was on his course ) , and by the end of term we were inseparable . Tom did n't seem to mind that I had poached " his " girl , and when Jo and I became a fixture he gave all the encouragement he could and refused to be a gooseberry . <p> The most surprising thing was the nondevelopment of Tom 's own love life . He remained a bachelor . When I mentioned this , as casually as I could , he shrugged . <p> " I believe in lasting relationships , " he said . <p> " So do I , " I said , a bit self-virtuously . <p> " I know but ... " Tom actually seemed flustered . " However hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's all . " <p> Tom 's nerve giving out on him ? Surely not . <p> " How do you know ? " I said . <p> " Because I 'm clever . " <p> It was toward the end of summer , 1984 that Tom and I had our biggest disagreement . Second-year students traditionally lived off-campus and we three were such good friends that surely , he said , it would be good if we moved in together ? <p> I was adamantly against it , and my reasoning must have been transparent . My relationship with Jo had still , despite my best efforts , a bit further to go . She was determined to be a one-man-per-lifetime girl and had just about convinced me that sex is n't the be-all and end-all of a relationship ; possibly a bonus , which we had yet to enjoy , if I indeed turned out to be said man . I was n't exactly pawing the ground , but on the other hand , given a year in a flat together , the possibility could n't be ruled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I liked Tom 's company , much as I could even admit to myself that I loved him , I could conjecture times when his presence might not be welcome . <p> Jo thought it was a great idea ( " he 'll be someone to talk to if we split up , " she said encouragingly ) , so grinding my teeth as quietly as I could I put my signature next to the other two on the application form . <p> SECOND YEAR , EASTER HOLIDAYS , 1985 <p> Tom 's twentieth birthday came and went . That was March 1985 , the last normal month I was to have for a long time . <p> One April evening I came up the stairs to our flat and to my surprise smelled chicken roasting . When I went into the kitchen , there was Tom , happily preparing a full Sunday-type meal . He had blown a fortnight 's budgeting . <p> " What are we celebrating ? " I asked . He waved an arm about him . <p> " Roast chicken , roast potatoes , gravy ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Not for a long time , " he admitted , " but when I was a boy I loved it . Mummy always cooked it to welcome me home . " <p> " But  --  " <p> " Here , this is for you . " He handed me a brown paper package , the size of an exercise book . It had TO TOM boldly inscribed on the front . <p> " It 's not for me , it 's for you , " I said . <p> " It will be . I want you to give it to me at eight o'clock this evening . Promise ? " <p> " Why ? " <p> " Just ... just an experiment , Will . Please ? Put it up there for safe keeping , if you like . " <p> I shrugged and put it up on the shelf he had indicated . <p> " All right , " I said , and set my watch for eight . <p> Jo came in a while later . <p> " How lovely ! " she exclaimed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's an experiment , " I said , a bit sarcastic , looking up from the potatoes I was slicing . <p> " We eat at quarter to eight . Okay ? " Tom said . <p> " Fine , " she said . <p> Tom was a prompt cook . Jo and I sat down and Tom took the chicken out of the oven . He carved it up and served the food onto the plates . We started eating . <p> Tom had taken three bites when it happened . He choked . <p> "  --  Gale ! " he shouted , leaping up and spraying food across the table . <p> " Tom ? " said Jo . Tom dropped his cutlery and stared about him , eyes wide and a look of utter bewilderment on his face . He looked down , saw his chair and dropped into it heavily . He jerked his gaze all around the room , as though desperately trying to find a familiar reference point . " Wwhere am I ? " <p> " Tom , do n't be  --  " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I knew Tom 's eyes and it was n't Tom in there now . There was a stranger , frowning , trying to recognize me . <p> " Where am I ? Who are you ? How did I get here ? " <p> " You 're Tom Melton , " Jo said soothingly . " You know that . " <p> " Yeah , I know who I am ... " He peered closely at me , then recoiled . " SSutton ? " he squeaked . <p> " It 's all right , Tom , " I said foolishly , trying to be soothing . " Everything 's fine ... " <p> " You ... you 're Will Sutton , are n't you ? How old are you ? " <p> " I 'm twenty , like you . " <p> " Twenty ! " <p> He went sheet white and looked around in horror . For the first time he really seemed to notice Jo and he blushed . <p> " Hello , " he said shyly . Jo had got her bag and was holding out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> He squinted at himself in the three square inches of glass , and his jaw dropped . He looked up . <p> " Have ... have you got a bigger mirror anywhere ? " <p> " Bathroom 's first on the right , " I said . He bolted , and Jo and I stared at each other . <p> " What 's happening ? " <p> " Some kind of breakdown ? " <p> There was a scream from the bathroom . We found him , sobbing , staring at his reflection through his fingers . <p> " Look at me ! " he choked . " Look at me  --  " <p> I had a sudden flashback  --  a memory that was six years old . Tom Melton in the washroom at school , looking in the mirror ... <p> I was about to pursue the train of thought when my watch beeped . Was this how Cinderella felt ? It 's amazing how doom-laden a clock striking the time can sound . Somehow I knew that Tom , earlier , had been expecting just this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living room , sat him down and gave him his package . <p> " This is for you , " I said . <p> It was a red-cloth exercise book , of the type we had had at school . Battered and old , but cared for . Tom opened it and began reading , while we watched . At first he seemed absorbed , then his lips began to tremble , and then with a wail he dropped it and curled up into a comer of the sofa , sobbing again . It was a pathetic sight . <p> Jo comforted him and I picked the book up . The writing inside was in Tom 's own hand , and the first words meant I had to keep on reading . <p> " GREETINGS , TIME TRAVELER ! ! ! <p> Yes , that 's right . Time traveler . You are Tom Melton , aged almost 14 in a body aged 20 . I 'm Tom Melton , aged 20 in a 14-year-old body , and it 's a bummer for both of us . <p> It 's 1985 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But take heart , you 'll survive . It wo n't be easy , but you have the best friend any bloke could ever have in Will Sutton . That 's about the only good news I have for you ; the next best thing is that you 're not going to die in the next six years , are you ? Think about it , Tommo  --  " <p> It made sense . Just . I could remember the scene that Tom went on to describe , back in the changing room in 1979 . Tom Melton , bullied and on the verge of a breakdown , trembling and muttering that he was about to flip . And flip he did  --  to six years in the future . His own , personal future . <p> Tom even produced an analogy . <p> " Look at it this way . Your life is a book , and every year is a page . The book has a beginning and a middle and an end . In your case , the book looks okay from the outside and it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it you find it was badly bound and twelve of the pages are out of order . You start at the beginning and read up to page 13 , but instead of page 14 it has page 21 . You read on to page 26 and find the next page is 14 . After another six pages you find they 're all in order again . <p> I 've been through everything you 're going through now and I know exactly how you feel reading this . You 're frightened and you 're the loneliest boy in the world . Well , you 're also the world 's leading authority on time travel . <p> There , that got a smile , did n't it ? Keep it up ... " <p> I browsed on through the book . The middle pages were blank , then I came to writing again . He had started from the back . It was a simple listing , he said , of everything he could remember about the six years that lay ahead of Tom now . There were laptop computers , jacuzzis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and places and events I 'd never heard of  --  Kylie and Jason , Challenger explodes , Warsaw Pact breaks up , Lockerbie , Hillsborough , the Gold Blend couple , massacre in Tiananmen Square , Berlin Wall comes down , Madonna , Oliver North , AIDS hysteria , the condom comeback , glasnost , the Brighton bombing , Fergie and Andrew , Mikhail and Raisa , George and Barbara , Thatcher 's downfall , Chernobyl , Herald of Free Enterprise , Terry Waite , Live Aid - no particular order , with no particular consistency of significance , and some ( like the Warsaw Pact and the Berlin Wall ) that I just could n't take seriously as predictions . The complete iconography of the eighties and the two years after , past and present and supposedly future , jumbled up at random . <p> When Tom had calmed down , I gave him the book back to read and retired to my room with Jo . We sat on the bed and I told her what the Tom from the past had said . <p> " I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " but I 'm sure he did change when he was fourteen , somehow . I mean , I know he changed , I was there ! He seemed so well balanced because he had to adjust himself to the world , anchor himself in reality like no one else , because otherwise he was so unsettled . Does that make sense to you ? " <p> Jo had a habit of seeing everyone 's point of view . <p> " And being a teenage boy who suddenly had to be an adult would make anyone grow up fast , would n't it ? " she said . " So what happens now ? " <p> " According to the book , he lives until  --  no , hang on ... " <p> It was mind boggling , but once we had sketched it out on the back of an envelope it made sense . Tom 's mind/soul/karma/whatever and his body were going to last together for another six years , until 1991 , when his mind would be 20 and his body would be 26 . Then his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its memories , to his nearly- 14-yearold body , where one of his first acts would be to cling to Stephen Gale , whisper the names of his various amours in his ear and threaten him with blackmail unless he stopped being a poisonous bully . Six years after that , when his mind was 26 and his body was 20 , Tom imagined ( and hoped ) that his mind would jump forward again and he would be reunited with his body in 1991 , when both body and mind would be the same age . That was where the Tom who had cooked tonight 's meal was now . <p> Hopefully . <p> We looked at each other . <p> " Shit , " I said . " We 've got a fourteen-year-old in there , Jo . " <p> " And we 're the only people he 's got , " she said . She held my gaze . <p> " Oh , shit , " I said again . I fell backward onto the bed to think about it . So this was what it was like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , timid knock at the door , and Tom poked his head round . <p> " Um ... Will ? " <p> " Hmm , " I grunted . <p> " Come in , Tom , " Jo said kindly . He sidled in , clutching the book . <p> " It ... it says here ... " He held the book out , like a supplicant illustrating his point to the Lord with a reference to the scriptures . " It says you 'll help me . " <p> He was still trying not to cry . Tom Melton , who had been a pillar of my life for so long , needed me . <p> " Does it ? " I said , as discouragingly as possible . Jo poked me ; there was a twinkle in her eyes . <p> " Look , dear , we 've got a boy , " she said . <p> For the third and final time , I said , " Oh , shit . " <p> In front of me was a badly frightened boy , totally alone , dependent purely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being responsible for anything , but at long last I took on a challenge . And what a challenge ! I made a list mentally . Someone had to teach him all his course work , who his friends were , how to drive ... <p> " I 'm scared , Will , " he said . <p> " Yeah , me too , " I grumped . I waved a hand at a chair . " Sit down , Tom . " He sat on the edge of the chair , hardly daring to move . I grinned . <p> " Sitting comfortably ? Then we 'll begin ...
