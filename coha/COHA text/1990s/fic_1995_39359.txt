By folding his legs so that his feet touched his thighs , Matt was able to completely immerse himself in hot water  --  water he had paid for shilling by shilling , dropping small English coins into a rusted metal box one by one to keep the water flowing until the bathtub was full . The tiny washroom was freezing and filled with roiling white mist . Matt held his breath until his chest began to hurt , and then he popped his head above the surface just long enough to grab some air before sliding back under . It was three o'clock in the morning . <p> A half hour ago , he had been fucking Janice . She was wiped out and crazy on some lunatic assortment of pills and coke and grass , and she had literally jumped on him and torn off his shirt and bit his shoulder . Jane was fifteen . He had n't wanted sex , but there was no way to deny her . When he came , she was already asleep . He rolled off her and closed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  he was dreaming . Uncle Mike , his father 's brother , strode toward him in an open , empty place , no surroundings really , just his uncle taking a few steps toward him . He was dressed immaculately in white , like a movie version of a Southern plantation owner , a crisp white suit tailored to his portly body . He wore a white , brimmed hat , and a white vest with a watch 's gold chain dangling stylishly from a vest pocket . His hands were clasped in front of him , and he said , " Matt . You 'll never make it . " Then there was a noise and the dream dissolved and Matt woke up with the image of his uncle vivid in his mind , his uncle who in reality was a ragged-looking , thin man with tattoos who always wore wrinkled clothes and who , his family guessed , had never run a comb through his long , greasy hair . <p> Someone had been knocking on the door : that was the noise that woke him . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolled off Janice at 2:30 . The knock came again , three times , a little louder , but still soft , as if the knocker had doubts about waking him so late at night . When he fully realized there was someone at the door , he sat up straight , and his heart took off like a sprinter . His apartment consisted of a single room with a bed ; a gas fireplace , which also worked by feeding coins into a meter ; and a table and chair that served as a desk and an eating area . He turned on the nightstand light and checked the room . The cocaine was hidden , wrapped in aluminum foil inside his guitar case under the bed . A package of condoms sat in the middle of the table , beside a pair of airline tickets . He tossed the condoms and the tickets out of sight before answering the door . For a moment he had considered flushing the drugs down the toilet , but even half asleep he realized the bobbies would n't be knocking so tentatively . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telegram from home . " It 's urgent , " she had said , her hair in curlers , her heavy body wrapped tightly in a wrinkled blue robe . " It 's from the States . " Matt thanked her and she walked away quickly , as if embarrassed . The telegram read : Uncle Mike had heart attack . Died Tuesday morning . Wake Wednesday and Thursday . Funeral on Friday . Please come home for funeral . Please . It was from his mother , and when he read it , sitting on the edge of his bed , he got suddenly lightheaded . He was twenty-two , and he had n't been home in more than a year . The words his uncle had spoken in the dream came back to him as if through an amplifier : " Matt . You 'll never make it . " His legs and arms began to shake . In the morning , with Janice , he was supposed to smuggle cocaine into Paris . Janice had done it many times . They were to wrap the cocaine inside condoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to Paris , they 'd take a laxative , and the condoms would come out , the cocaine safe inside . He needed the money , and he had flirted with Janice and cajoled her and insinuated himself into her favor , and then he had started sleeping with her , a crazy , fifteen-year-old , lost little rich girl  --  all so that she would let him in on her deal . And now he was sure he would never make it . His uncle had come back from the dead to tell him . The flight would take too long and the latex would break down in his stomach and the massive dose of cocaine would kill him . <p> Water clung to Matt 's skin as he climbed out of the bathtub . When he saw himself in the full-length mirror on the back of the bathroom door , he was streaming clouds of mist . He dressed quickly , putting on heavy combat boots and jeans and a torn flannel shirt over a union suit that needed washing . Back in his room , the clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loafers and khaki pants , the light-blue shirt with the button-down collar , and the London Fog overcoat  --  they lay neatly over the back of a chair , pressed and ready for the trip . Janice was sleeping on her side with her knees pulled up to her chest and her hands between her legs . Nights , out in the clubs , she looked like a teenage Shirley Temple gone bad , in torn blue jeans and a leather jacket , with a lingerie model 's body and a little girl 's face , a bad little girl . Asleep , she looked almost innocent , almost like a baby  --  but still wild , a wild innocence , even asleep , the way her wavy blond hair curled and tangled around plump cheeks and big eyes . In the morning she would scrub herself pink and pull her hair back into a ponytail before dressing up in a knee-length skirt and schoolgirl white shoes . That was her outfit for the Paris run . <p> Last time , Matt had helped her slide the condoms down her throat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was something perversely erotic about it , pushing the cocaine-stuffed condoms down her throat while she sat on the floor by the bed , her head tilted all the way back and her eyes glittering with something that looked to Matt like craziness . Afterwards they had sex . Without asking , she had knelt by the bed , with her stomach on the mattress , and Matt had pulled up the knee-length skirt and pulled down the white cotton panties , and when he looked at her , he saw that she was laughing quietly to herself , as if amused by his predictability  --  as if she knew the whole scene would turn him on because he was a man and she was amused that she was right about him , that she had him pegged . When he finished , Matt had felt frightened . He had felt frightened and uneasy for days . <p> He pulled his guitar case out from under the bed and unlocked it with a small key he kept on a chain around his neck . He opened it carefully , holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one by one . Inside the case , his guitar nestled snugly against <p> plush red lining . The polished blond wood of the soundboard reflected the red and blue flames from the gas fireplace , and the hand-carved hummingbird on the pick guard appeared to move in the wavering firelight . Matt lifted the guitar and removed his wallet from a small compartment under the neck . He had two five-pound notes folded up neatly next to his long-expired visa . He put the wallet in the back pocket of his jeans , locked up the guitar case , and slid it back under the bed . <p> Once on the street , he started for Stevie 's apartment . Stevie sang for The Flesh Puppets , a band Matt had played with up until a couple of months ago . Matt had quit because he wanted Stevie for himself , and she wanted to do what she wanted , which included sleeping with women . After a few months , he realized anyway that her relationship with him was mostly for show . Really , it was other women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he left . But now , when he needed someone to talk with , someone to tell what had happened , to tell about his dream , he could n't imagine who else but Stevie . Who else on the planet ? He was twenty-two , and there had been three women in his life , excluding his mother . There was Cathy from home , from Wisconsin , whom he had started dating in ninth grade and gone out with at least once a week up until the time he shocked everyone and bought the charter ticket to London . But he had never really been able to talk to Cathy . He might tell her about his dream , and she would listen  --  but she would be uncomfortable . She would feel like he was turning the tables on her . Cathy was supposed to talk . He was supposed to listen . Then there was Janice , but her communication , with him , anyway , was mostly physical . That left only Stevie , and so Matt was headed for her building , which was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of night would n't be a problem . <p> When he arrived at her apartment , he found the door half-open . A chokingly sweet haze of incense wafted into the hallway . Matt pushed the door open and found Richie and Dave sitting on the kitchen floor looking back at him with guitars in their laps . <p> " American Pie , " Richie said , a clear note of relief in his voice . <p> " We been gettin ' ripped off by the local scags , " Dave said . <p> Richie opened a cabinet door under the sink and pulled out an ashtray with a couple of half-smoked joints . He placed the ashtray on the floor between him and Dave , and took a long drag off a joint . " We heard you coming up the stairs , " he said , his voice high . <p> Matt said , " I 'm looking for Stevie . " <p> " There 's a surprise , " Richie said . <p> Dave pointed down the hall toward Stevie 's bedroom . " She ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is she ever ? " <p> Dave turned back to his guitar . " Not often , " he said softly , and he played a few chords and then looked up to Richie , who began to play along with him . <p> Matt followed the dimly lit corridor to Stevie 's room . He stopped in front of the hanging beads that served as a door . The room behind the beads was lit by a single red candle on a curtainless window ledge , and drippings from the castle-shaped candle spilled over the ledge and down the wall to the baseboards . There was no real furniture in the room , only a mattress on the floor and some cardboard boxes spread around to serve as dressers and drawers . In the candlelight , Matt could see Stevie sitting up on her mattress , a sheet held over her breasts , her back against the wall , smoking a cigarette and looking at him through the bead curtain . She was a small woman , sylphlike in her movements , offstage ; but when she sang , onstage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electric current regularly jolted her : first she 'd be singing motionless , limp as the dead , then she 'd suddenly fly in spasms around the stage , her arms and legs everywhere , as if she had lost her mind and all control of her body , and the music had possessed her , as if she 'd suddenly gone crazy  --  and usually the audience went crazy with her . Matt hesitated on his side of the curtain . He could see another figure curled up beside Stevie on the mattress . <p> " My , my , hm hmm hmm , " Stevie sang softly . " You just want to watch ? " <p> " Watch what ? " Matt parted the bead curtain and stepped into the room . <p> Stevie pulled back the covers on the girl sleeping next to her . She was young and smooth-skinned , her body sleek as an athlete 's . <p> " Beautiful , " Matt said . <p> She touched the sleeping girl 's hair gently . " You want to join us ? " she asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's into good-looking men . " <p> Matt sat on the floor beside Stevie . " Maybe , " he said . He had tried that once before , sleeping with Stevie and one of her pickups . It had been strange in the beginning , in bed with two women , and even stranger at the end , when it was over , Stevie and her girl asleep cuddled into each other , and him on his side of the bed , alone . He felt like a sexual accessory . And he had been frightened , a kind of deep , unnameable anxiety shaking him up , keeping him from sleeping . In the morning , when he had told Stevie he would n't do it again , she had been disappointed . But now , with Stevie 's offer , he could feel his blood moving . " I need to talk to you , " he said . " Something incredible just happened . " <p> " What ? " She put out her cigarette and leaned toward him . Her interest was apparent in her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was excited . " Really ? " <p> Matt told her about his dream and the telegram . <p> " Was he sick ? " Stevie asked . " Could you have known ? " <p> " He was n't old . He was n't sick Matt touched his forehead as if checking for a fever . " It 's blowing me away . " <p> Stevie grinned . She seemed pleased , as if something she already knew was now being revealed to Matt , something that would make them closer when they both knew . " You never saw him dressed like that ? An old picture or something ? " <p> " He was a slob . That 's the last way  --  " <p> Stevie said , " Then you know it was real . " <p> " But I need to know what it means . " <p> Stevie slid down on the mattress and propped her head up on one hand . The sheet fell loosely over her breasts . " You want everything wrapped up , " she said . " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " What are you talking about ? " <p> " It happened . It 's a mystery . " <p> " It does n't make you ask questions ? Like , Where 's he going ? How come he was dressed like that ? What happens when you die ? " <p> She touched Matt 's knee . " I 'm not into controlling things . I 'm into the music of it . " <p> Matt closed his eyes and let his chin drop to his chest . He wanted silence for a moment . He wanted to think . Stevie and Richie and Dave  --  they thought of him as an innocent , as a boy . They called him American Pie , or Apple Pie , even though he smoked dope with them , and played with them , and slept with Stevie : no matter what he did , it did n't seem to change their perception of him . Partly , it was the way he looked . He had a round , boyish face that made him look even younger than he was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a fifteen-year-old girl ; and he had the straight , white teeth and the healthy skin of a milk-fed , well-cared-for child . He looked like a six-foot two-inch baseball player from Iowa  --  which is exactly what he had been in high school , except he was from Wisconsin . But he was twenty-two now , and he wanted something different . He was n't sure what Stevie meant about controlling things , or the music of it , but he was n't going to ask . " Me , too , " he said . " I 'm into the music of it , too , but  --  " <p> " What about what he said ? " Stevie interrupted . " What do you think that means ? " <p> " That 's the scary part . " The sheet over Stevie had drifted down , revealing most of her breasts and her back . Matt could feel his breath catching in his throat when he spoke . " Can I lie next to you ? " he asked . " Would that be all right ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crawl in next to her . Matt looked at her for a long moment , taking in her body , the swellings and curves , the light and dark places . Then he lay down next to her , facing her , and she covered them both with the sheet . Behind Stevie , the other woman stirred and then sat up and looked , surprised , at Matt . " What 's this ? " she said , not bothering to cover herself up , an edge of anger in her voice . <p> " He 's a friend , " Stevie said , without turning around . " We 're talking . " <p> The woman seemed to think about this for a moment . Then she smiled and said , as if excusing her momentary anger , " I 'm still asleep , " and she cuddled up into Stevie , wrapping her arms around her chest and snuggling against her . <p> " What 's the scary part ? " Stevie said . " Just what exactly did he say ? " <p> " What I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . He took , like , two steps toward me , and he had this concerned , like , sad look on his face , and he goes , ' Matt , you 'll never make it . ' " <p> " You think he meant as a musician , an artist ? You 'll never have any success , you 'll never be any good ? That way ? " <p> Matt shook his head . " I 'm supposed to smuggle some coke into Paris tomorrow with Janice . She 's done it a couple of times to make money : you put the coke in a condom , you swallow  --  " <p> " You 're not going to do it , right ? Right ? " <p> Matt did n't answer . <p> Stevie put her hand on Matt 's neck , her thumb gentle against his cheek . " You know what can happen ? " she said . " You know bow long it 'll take that much coke to kill you ? About two seconds . " <p> Matt laid his head on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " I 've been out of money for weeks . If I do n't do this , I 've got to go home . " <p> Stevie was quiet for a time . She stroked Matt 's hair , running her fingers over the back of his head and his neck . " I see my father sometimes in dreams , " she said . " He was killed in the Falklands war , which no one even remembers anymore . " <p> Matt tried to look up , but she was holding his head pressed tightly to her . <p> " I know it 's not very little . He held me on his shoulder under a moon just like that and told me always to remember it and the moment would never disappear . When we 're standing under an orange moon like that , then he 's visiting me and it 's not just a dream . " <p> " Do you believe that , really ? " Matt pulled away from Stevie . " That the dead come back and talk to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You should n't go tomorrow . No matter what . " <p> Matt turned over on his stomach and pressed his head into the mattress . " I told Janice I 'd go with her , " he mumbled . " She 's expecting me to go with her . " He felt sick . His stomach was jittery , on the edge of being nauseous . <p> Stevie lay her head on Matt 's back . " What are you doing with that girl ? " she asked , her voice not much above a whisper . " Do you even know what you 're doing ? " <p> Matt thought about Janice , about how he could explain her to Stevie . On the surface she looked like a brat . Her father was an earl or a duke , or some such title , and her family was wealthy  --  extravagantly wealthy . But she had n't taken a cent from her family since she turned twelve . She had run away and been brought back time and again , until they just gave up on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last three years  --  mostly by smuggling drugs . She was fifteen . She had poems by Rimbaud committed to memory . She listened to Bartok and Frank Zappa . Matt had met her at a bar when he was still sleeping with Stevie and playing with the band . She had walked up to him and said , " Thirty-five thousand children die every day of starvation and my father has three homes . " She was wrecked , of course . She was so high , she probably had no idea what she was saying . Matt had laughed and then felt stupid when Janice appeared hurt by his laughter . She had stumbled away before he could think of anything else to say . <p> Matt closed his eyes and fell asleep without realizing it . When he woke up , it was light out , and Stevie and the other woman were curled up together in a ball on the far side of the bed . The other woman was snoring lightly . He picked himself up slowly from the mattress , thinking he might have already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air , on her way to Paris without him . He quietly left Stevie 's room and entered the dark hallway . In the kitchen , he found Richie asleep on the floor , an ashtray full of roaches near his head and a gallon jug of wine held tightly to his chest , as if he were a child and the jug were a teddy bear . He looked around the room for a clock , but the walls were bare . The only furniture was a kitchen table , and the only thing on the table was Richie 's guitar . <p> Matt stood quietly in the kitchen . He thought about what it would be like to call Cathy . She would be happy to get his call . She might not act that way at first , but she would be happy . When he left the apartment and went out to the street , he saw a husky old man unlocking the doors to a newspaper stand ; and , behind the newspaper stand , a steady stream of people descending the stairs into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book him a seat on a flight home . When he got off the plane , she 'd be there at the airport , waiting . She 'd tell his parents , and they 'd be there , too , as well as her parents . It would be a party , a reunion , a welcome home : he could see Cathy standing there , picture her face , round like his own , her shoulder-length brown hair falling toward her shoulders , the ends turned under in a satiny curl . She was not an especially attractive girl , though she certainly was n't ugly . Matt thought of her as plain , a not very attractive girl . He had known her since she was thirteen . At the airport , his mother would cry . She would cover her mouth with her hands . The men would hang back . Then would come the embraces , the hugs and tears , the pats on the back  --  and he 'd be home . <p> Matt asked the time at the newspaper stand . It was a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris flight left at eight-fifteen from Heathrow . First he walked and then he ran , and when he opened the door to his room , he found Janice standing by his bed , glaring at him . She pointed to his guitar case , which was in the middle of the floor . " I broke the lock , " she said . " I thought you 'd just split . " <p> Matt closed the door by leaning against it . " I fell asleep , " he said . " I woke up with a dream that  --  " <p> " There 's a cab on the way , " Janice said . " I 'm all ready . If you want to do this thing with me ... " She gestured toward the back of the chair where Matt 's clothes were waiting . <p> In her navy blue skirt and white blouse , with her hair pulled back in a ponytail and her face scrubbed dean of makeup , Janice looked like a child , like a little girl . For a moment , Matt did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paralyzed . Janice stared at him , waiting , and the look in her eyes was a question : What 's it going to be , Matt ? What are you going to do ? Matt 's hand moved slowly toward the buttons of his flannel shirt . He imagined again the airport scene as he arrived home : his parents and Cathy 's , Cathy walking toward him . <p> Then he remembered a summer night when he was a senior in high school : both families had come to one of his baseball games to watch him play ; he had his own cheering section in the bleachers . After the game , Cathy 's two little brothers came running across the field to him , as if he were a hero . His parents went home , and he went to Cathy 's , where Cathy and her mother prepared dinner while he drank a beer with her father and talked about the game . After dinner they all watched television , and after her parents went to bed , he made out with Cathy until they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , where his mother had waited up for him and wanted to know how the night had gone . The memory of that night felt like a great weight , or like a pressure suit  --  something that enclosed him and pressed against him . He undid the top button of his shirt and looked again at Janice , who was looking back at him now with curiosity , like a scientist observing the behavior of an animal . <p> " Matt , " Janice said , her voice not angry . " Just tell me . Are you coming with me or not ? " <p> Matt nodded . <p> " You 're coming ? " <p> He nodded again . <p> Janice pushed his hands away and began undoing the buttons of his shirt . " You 're scared , " she said . " I was scared the first time , too . I was terrified . " She leaned into him and peeled the shirt off his back . <p> Matt wanted to tell her about the dream , but the words were n't coming . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around his thighs , he sat on the bed and lifted his legs . She knelt in front of him and let his feet rest in her lap while she untied his shoelaces and pulled off his boots . Matt was watching Janice undress him , but he was thinking about his uncle . <p> Once , when he was a boy of eight or nine , he had bicycled to his uncle 's farmhouse . He had n't told his parents because this was a period of time when the talk about his uncle was all hushed and solemn . From hearing the grown-ups , he knew that his uncle Mike had been to war in Vietnam . He had heard bits and pieces of things about drugs and shootings . He had heard some things about women . His uncle kept leaving town and coming back , as if the town were a prison and he could never manage a successful escape ; and every time he came back , he looked stranger . He had a beard . No one else in the family had a beard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole town , that Matt knew , anyway , had long hair . This time when Matt bicycled to the farmhouse , it was one of the times when his uncle had just come back from being away , and everybody was whispering about him . Matt had bicycled the full ten miles out of town to the rundown farmhouse where his uncle lived , and he had found him asleep in his living room . He remembered that the house had been neat , but weirdly decorated : hubcaps were nailed to the wall in the kitchen and living room , and his uncle 's sculptures that he made out of farm junk were displayed on tables and in nooks and crannies , places where anyone else in his family would have placed a lamp or a knickknack  --  and there was a closed-up wooden crate in the kitchen , hanging by a chain from the ceiling , the kind of crate that 's made of wire and thin wood . <p> This one was dosed , and a padlock was looped through the wire , so that you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crate was a candle . It was round and it was big , the size of a carnival fishbowl . It was rust-red with a thick black wick that was lit and burning . Wax dripped down the sides of the candle and onto the crate and through the slats to the floor . Matt looked at the crate with the lit candle , and he could n't imagine why anyone would do such a thing : put a lit candle inside a locked wooden crate . He tiptoed into the living room , where his uncle was sleeping in a tilted-back recliner with a bottle of whiskey on the floor beside him . He was wearing a crisp white T-shirt with I Love WISCONSIN printed beneath an idyllic picture of a farmhouse surrounded by barns and silos and cows lazily chewing grass in a pasture . He was curled up in the chair , hugging his chest , his arms underneath the T-shirt , as if it were a straitjacket . Matt remembered being struck by the contrast between that clean white T-shirt and his uncle 's haggard face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had never told his uncle about the visit , his uncle or anyone else . <p> This was the uncle who had come to him in his dream . This was the uncle who had told him he 'd never make it . <p> When Janice finished undressing him , Matt stood up and put on the cordovan penny loafers and the khaki slacks , the blue shirt with the button-down collar and the London Fog overcoat . Janice brushed his hair for him and kissed him on the cheek . " Do n't be scared , " she whispered . " We can do it , " she said , and she took him by the arm , gently , and had him sit on the floor by the bed and tilt his head back , the way he had seen her do it , and open his mouth wide . <p> First he closed his eyes ; then he opened them and he watched her coat the outside of a condom with some kind of a gel before she lowered it into his mouth and began pushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she told him to relax . <p> Outside , the cabbie honked his horn . Janice opened the window and yelled that they 'd be right down . Then she came to him again , and this time he closed his eyes , and he imagined what they 'd look like as they boarded the plane , like a brother and sister , like a couple of kids going off by themselves on a journey , and he relaxed and tried to ignore the pain as best he could , the feeling like he was being ripped open at the neck as she pushed the condom down his throat . <p>
