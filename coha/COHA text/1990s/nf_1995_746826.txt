Play is the thing at the Pacific Science Center 's new exhibit , " Science in Toyland , " where visitors are encouraged to learn about scientific principles in a fun and creative way . While learning about physics , chemistry , and other science fields , youngsters can build a child-sized house in the Kids Construction Co. , trigger a chain reaction in Domino Challenge , build block models of famous skyscrapers in Block City , and get a race car to do a loop-the-loop at the Roller Coaster . <p> One of the most exciting displays at the new exhibit is the K'nexhibition , a series of spinning , twirling models of everything from animals to amusement park rides that are made from some 125,000 snapped-together K'NEX model-building pieces . Highlights include a 7-foot motorized ferris wheel , a working lighthouse , and a functioning roller coaster , as well as a K'NEX monkey that swings from vines and K'NEX boats that navigate a K'NEX river . Visitors can build their own models that they can purchase and take home or leave for others to enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the Northwest Toy Chest , a display of actual toys and replicas of playthings that inspired Northwest personalities . Items include a replica of actor Tom Skerritt 's tinker toys , Bill Nye the Science Guy 's model cars , and Seattle Symphony music director Gerard Schwarz 's toy piano . The exhibit will run from February 18 through September 6 , 1995 . For more information , contact the Pacific Science Center , 200 Second Ave .

The new feature , which opened April 8 , provides twenty-five hands-on interactive exhibits aimed at helping us better understand that submicroscopic carrier of heredity  --  DNA . Visitors can use the exhibits to learn about the basics of DNA and how it stores the information that shapes every living thing ; study the physical underpinnings of genetic science ; and explore the sometimes controversial social , legal , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lectures by leading genetic researchers . <p> " Diving Into the Gene Pool " focuses on four broad areas of concern : the nature of DNA , the diversity of organisms , biotechnology , and the Human Genome Project . Each area presents a basis for experiencing and understanding the pure science in these delicate pursuits as well as the issues that they raise . Interactive exhibits help familiarize the public with life 's basic structure ; for example , Musical Mutants is a computerized demonstration of how changes in a DNA strand 's code affects the creation of proteins , the molecular building blocks of life . At the Protein Production Line , visitors can lay out their own DNA blueprints by experimenting with interlocking puzzle pieces , through which they will learn how just a few proteins can combine in innumerable ways to create the amazing diversity of life . At the Fruit Fly Zoo , this diversity is vividly demonstrated by the wide range of variation even within such a " lowly " species . And visitors will be startled to find that they share many of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is dedicated to unlocking the secrets of genes in all life forms in order to modify them for some benefit , is explored in several exhibits . Marching Bands demonstrates the basic means by which researchers are able to isolate and collect individual bits of DNA and allows members of the public to experiment with the same sequencing gel techniques that professionals use . Methods covered include DNA fingerprinting in forensic laboratories , a procedure brought into sharp focus by the media hype surrounding the O. J. Simpson case . <p> The final focus area of the exhibit is devoted to the Human Genome Project , an effort to map the entire DNA sequence of human genes . Visitors can view a giant interactive map of the human genome that shows both the location and function of a number of genes on the human chromosomes and what they control . The exhibit also raises questions about the potentially powerful impact of the " map " on such issues as health and healing and , not coincidentally , the parallel concerns of privacy , insurability , and even a patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coincide with the exhibit include Seedy Science Day , Blooming Genes Day , Dog Diversity Day , and DNA Dining Day , when visitors will get to taste genetically engineered tomatoes as well as several heirloom vegetables .

Deadline for submission is May 31 , 1995 . <p> How can a stuffed skunk and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask David Police , a Burris Laboratory School math instructor  --  he uses them , along with a number of other natural history artifacts from the Smithsonian Institution 's collections to help improve math scores in his classes . Last December Police received 600 items from the Smithsonian and worked with fellow teachers and Ball State University researchers to find ways to use the items in the daily school curriculum . Notes Police , " Certain species of shells can give us a world of statistical information . Our students can learn why those shells formed the way they did . " <p> The various artifacts , which include antlers , a cow skull , a bird skeleton , and a number of stuffed animals , will be the keys to bridging several major disciplines and to allowing students to learn about math and science at the same time . " Whether it is an artifact from the collection or something a student finds in the backyard , several disciplines can be taught and learned , " says Police . " Real-world learning allows teachers to use whatever they have on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Burris , Indiana 's last remaining laboratory school , has a student body of about six hundred students in grades K-12 . The school is administered by Ball State Teachers College and will serve as a test site for developing curriculum ideas using the Smithsonian 's holdings , thanks to a $130,000 grant from the Eisenhower Foundation . The grant will allow the project team to work with area math and science teachers and to develop a database of lessons available to teachers via Internet . <p> For more information on the program , contact Francine Peterman , Public Information Services , Ball State University , Muncie , IN 47306 ; 317/285-1560 ; fax 317/285-5442 . <p> Just " do it " is the philosophy behind the newly opened Children 's Museum of Virginia in Portsmouth . Through its more than sixty interactive exhibits , the museum hopes to inspire a love of learning and increased cultural , educational , and recreational developmental levels in children who visit . Features include a sixty-four-seat , wheelchair-accessible planetarium ; the " New 2 Do " Gallery , which will contain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Science Circus , " which encourages scientific discovery through the manipulation of mazes , hydraulic lifts , pulleys , and perpetual motion machines ; and " Hocus Focus , " which relates physics , mathematics , and eye physiology and perception to the manipulation of optical illusions , puzzles , and experiments . <p> Other exhibits include " The City , " in which young visitors can role-play various occupations , such as firefighters and police officers , that are integral to city life ; and " You and Me , " which focuses on exploring individual similarities and differences and strives to create a greater appreciation for cultural diversity . And for those visitors interested in " beyond-hands-on " experiences , there is a horizontal rock-climb that tests kids ' sense of balance and grasp of gravity ; a bubble room that lets visitors explore surface tension , refraction , and other physics concepts using bubbles as models ; and a working crane for use in building model structures . <p> The museum is located at 221 High Street in Olde Towne Portsmouth , Virginia . For hours and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science is an activity-based program designed by Educational Equity Concepts , Inc. , to address the education-related biases that are continuing to keep women and minorities out of science careers , and it recently went nationwide . The program revolves around a series of simple hands-on experiments that can be completed by children and parents either in school or at home . The activities are designed to make parents realize that they know more science than they think just from everyday experiences . And national studies have shown that a child 's academic success depends more on parent participation than on the material resources of the child 's school . Playtime Is Science is aimed at parents and teachers of four- through eight-year-olds for use in schools , day-care centers , and homes . <p> The program was first piloted in 1986 in the Bronx , New York , and was such a success that a three-year plan is now beginning in schools across the country . Also , a national training and implementation program will be run through federally funded regional Desegregation Assistance Centers ( DACs ) . The short-term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test the program in schools and community organizations in each of the four national test sites , ( 2 ) develop and field-test printed materials and videotapes , ( 3 ) conduct research on outcomes for children , ( 4 ) create regional training and implementation networks , and ( 5 ) disseminate the program nationally . <p> In addition to the activities , Educational Equity Concepts also provides several types of on-site staff-development training sessions as well as a number of guide books , including Playtime Is Science : Implementing a Parent/Child Activity Program . which contains step-by-step instructions on planning and running the program in a school or community center ; What Will Happen If . . . Young Children and the Scientific Method , which gives teachers ideas about implementing age-appropriate activities in the classroom ; and Hands on the Science , a staff development guide that complements What Will Happen If . . . <p> Some of the activities offered in the program are Creating a Mystery Bottle , an activity that allows children to see for themselves the truth of the saying , " Oil and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liquid ? , which helps children explore the properties of a discrepant substance ; and Bubble Science , in which children invent their own bubble makers to explore the process of cohesion among molecules . All of the activities help children develop higher-order thinking skills as well as the self-confidence to confront and think through new situations and test out new ideas and assumptions . <p> To find out more about Playtime Is Science , contact Educational Equity Concepts , Inc. , 114 East 32nd St. , New York , NY 10016 ; 212/725-1803 ; fax 212/725-0947 . <p> New " neighborhoods " will be springing up at the Kansas City Museum thanks to a $25 million grant from the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation . The funds will go toward the creation of Science City , a novel science-center idea created by David A. Ucko , the museum 's president , that will include interactive exhibits and educational programs . Science City will allow visitors to " go behind the scenes of a modern metropolis to learn about the science and technology that surrounds their everyday lives . They will learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the human body in the medical center ; take simulated space voyages in a space station simulator ; and much , much more , " says Ucko . <p> For more information on Science City , which is scheduled to open in 1996 , contact the Kansas City Museum , 3218 Gladstone Blvd. , Kansas City , MO 64123-1199 ; 816/483-8300 ; fax 816/483-9912 . <p> It 's chaos for Science Teachers at Boston University 's Center for Polymer Studies and Science and Mathematics Education Center . New educational materials developed by students and staff members at the two centers aim to help teachers make science more engaging through the use of fractals to study natural systems . Called Patterns in Nature , the new materials packet was presented this summer to thirty-two high school science teachers who participated in a two-week seminar at the university . Patterns in Nature is designed to allow students to learn about science through the use of computers and through interaction with peers in what is termed " the cooperative learning classroom . " In such an educational system , the teacher assumes the role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eugene Stanley , professor of physics and director of the Center for Polymer Studies , " For high school students , studying science has traditionally meant learning fundamental laws and theories that were discovered long ago . With exposure to interactive scientific models , the students come to understand that the scientist is much more a detective than a technician . " Through the active investigation of seemingly random patterns in nature , such as the formation of a coastline or the path of a wildfire , students learn the concepts of probability and fractals by assuming the role of the research scientist and by exploring physical models and using computers to manipulate and explain interactive visual displays . By studying fractal patterns in nature , students are exposed to concepts that span many fields , including physics , chemistry , biology , and environmental science . <p> For more information on Patterns of Nature or Boston University 's teacher seminars , contact the Science and Mathematics Education Center , Boston University , 605 Commonwealth Ave. , Boston , MA 02215 ; 617/353-7100 . <p> " The Journey Inside " is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to teachers soon through the joint efforts of the International Society for Technology in Education ( ISTE ) and Intel Corporation .
