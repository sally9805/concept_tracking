<p> The sight of yellow school buses rumbling through neighborhoods , stopping every few minutes to let off kids in backpacks has never attracted much attention . The buses were just there  --  as much a part of the landscape as subdivision signs that say " Slow  --  Children at Play " and the flower flags fluttering from front porch rails . <p> But laser-like attention has focused on school buses since last week when a 13-year-old boy was beaten to death after he stepped off his bus in southern Cherokee . Students and parents now talk about danger on the bus . The school board is trying to determine if it can do more to safeguard students . A state legislator has pledged to push for a law to combat bullying . <p> Drivers , meanwhile , were left to wonder why everyone was so surprised . <p> " The general public has absolutely no conception of what goes on on the school bus , " said Richard Armstrong , who drives students to and from E.T . Booth Middle School and Etowah Middle School , near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an eighth-grader at E.T . Booth , was hit in the head , kicked in the stomach and hit in the face after he got off a bus in his Port Victoria subdivision near Lake Allatoona . He lay in a coma for two days before his family told doctors to remove him from breathing machines . Investigators charged Jonathan Miller , a 15-year-old sophomore at Etowah High who rode the bus with Josh , with murder . <p> Witnesses said Jonathan taunted Josh on the bus and threw paper wads and broken pencils at him . <p> Josh and Jonathan did not ride Armstrong 's bus , but Armstrong has seen similar tension between middle- and high-schoolers explode into violence . The week before Josh died , Armstrong said , he had to break up a fight between a middle-school student and a high-schooler on his bus . He said it 's easy for him because he is a large man who cuts an imposing figure , but older or meeker drivers , particularly women , might have a tough time controlling unruly kids . <p> Jo Babb drove a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few years ago prompted her to call it quits . The fight also involved a high-schooler and a middle-school student . They exchanged insults , she said , moments before the older boy began beating up the younger one . <p> " I honestly thought he was going to beat him to death , " she said . " Blood was everywhere . " <p> Violence often flares on school buses in Cherokee County , according to police reports . <p> Last October , a mother climbed aboard a bus and screamed at the driver because , she said , a child on the bus had threatened to kill her child , who also rode the bus . The mother said the bus driver was not doing enough to stop the threats . <p> In May , a 13-year-old student at R.M. Moore Elementary School had a " verbal altercation " with his bus driver and was banned from the bus . The next day , investigators said , he threatened to kill students in his school . <p> In September , sheriff 's deputies heard from a boy complaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a baseball bat and threatening him . In another incident , they charged a woman with simple assault after she screamed at a driver  --  the driver said it caused her to miscarry . Later in September , a student at Cherokee High School reportedly threatened to kill his bus driver and , less than a week after that , a student at Sequoyah High reportedly threatened to booby trap his bus stop . Investigators said the boy wanted to kill younger students whom he believed were stealing cigarettes he 'd hidden near the bus stop . <p> Last month , investigators said a student at Woodstock High School showed a homemade bomb to kids on his bus . Detectives arrested the student the next day . Authorities detonated his bomb and said it could have caused serious injury . <p> Bus drivers across metro Atlanta say students lack discipline and respect . Their concerns are being voiced at a time when officials in Clayton , Cobb , Gwinnett and Fulton counties say they need to hire more bus drivers . <p> But that may be easier said than done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ County is $ 9,962 . A bus driver with 10 years experience gets $ 10,424 . <p> And drivers are not the only ones worried about bus safety . <p> Elizabeth Strickin , 15 , a sophomore at Etowah High , said she stopped riding the bus after middle school because she hated it so much . She said supervision is lax on the bus . <p> " All the bus driver can do is just drive the bus , " she said . " They do n't really know what 's going on . " <p> Another problem with discipline comes from mixing high school and middle school students on the same bus . As a rule , Elizabeth said , older kids pick on younger ones , even though most of it is in jest and never turns physical . <p> " I was so scared of the big kids every time I got on the bus , " she said . " I was so scared they would pick on me . " <p> Middle- and high-school students ride different buses in several metro Atlanta counties , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buses in Cherokee , Coweta , Fayette and other counties . School officials in Gwinnett say they have reduced discipline problems on their buses by assigning seats and ensuring that most children ride the bus only with students from their school . <p> Mike McGowan , a spokesman for Cherokee schools , said the county would have to buy dozens of buses to ensure that middle-schoolers and high-schoolers would n't be riding the same bus . Lots of parents said after last week 's fatal assault that middle-schoolers and high-schoolers should ride different buses , but the school board has not formally discussed that option . <p> Two days after Josh died , however , school board member Carol Benton , who chairs the board 's Safety Committee , asked system administrators to look for ways to improve school-bus safety . Superintendent Corky Jones said officials will review whether the school system should make changes to try to safeguard students on its buses . <p> " We have a good discipline handbook in place that gives administrators the right to put kids off the bus if there 's a problem , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a look and see if there 's anything more we can do . " <p> The school board created a safety committee in May , after investigators accused a 13-year-old student at R.M. Moore Elementary School of threatening to kill fellow students  --  a threat , they say , that followed an argument between the boy and his bus driver . The committee recommended at last week 's school board work session that each school conduct at least one event a year to educate the public on school rules and safety issues . It also proposed the creation of an alternative school for special education and chronically disruptive students and the creation of crisis teams at each school . <p> Other safety committee recommendations to the school board : Develop a campus police department . Require school-system and high-school employees to wear photo-identification badges . Ban book bags in high schools . Start a Teen Court to supplement existing disciplinary procedures . Establish a dress code for middle- and high-school students . Phase-in uniforms for students . <p> The school board is scheduled to discuss the recommendations tonight at 7 at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get involved . Rep. Chuck Scheid ( R-Woodstock ) said Monday he plans to introduce a bill in January that would seek to discourage bullying . The proposal would make three changes to state law . <p> Scheid 's proposed law would require school officials to : Post the state law on school conduct in every classroom in public and private schools . Notify law-enforcement agencies when students complain of bullying . Notify the parents of an accused bully and the victim of a bully of a reported case of bullying . <p> Scheid said he agreed to push the proposal after meeting with Bill Head , a south Cherokee man whose only son , Brian , killed himself in a classroom at Etowah High School in March 1994 . Head said Brian was fed up with being bullied and taunted . <p> Head has sued the Cherokee school system . A judge threw out the lawsuit , but Head has appealed . <p> After Brian Head killed himself , the school board adopted a policy banning taunting , bullying and harassment in schools . <p> Witnesses and neighbors described Jonathan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Syrop , disputed that characterization . <p> " He did n't come across as the demon he 's being portrayed as , " Syrop said last week . <p> Jonathan has been held at the Youth Detention Center in Gainesville since hours after the attack . Deputies charged him with murder , and prosecutors plan to try him as an adult . Authorities based the murder charge on a state law that says anyone who commits a felony that results in a death can be charged with murder even if the person did n't intended to kill anyone . The earliest a grand jury could formally indict Jonathan is December . <p> Across the United States , Josh is the 18th student to die in non-traffic accident incidents on or around school buses since 1993 , according to the National School Safety Center in Thousand Oaks , Calif . Most of the 18 were shot . A few were stabbed . One committed suicide . <p> Josh 's death prompted an outpouring of tears and sympathy for the Belluardo and Miller families . Students left makeshift memorials for Josh  --  teddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shallow Cove , the cul-de-sac where he and Jonathan lived across the street from each other , and at the base of the flagpole at E.T . Booth Middle School , where he was in eighth grade . <p> Josh 's death left students reflective . <p> " The bus has been so quiet it 's almost scary , " said Jeremy Woelfel , a 15-year-old freshman at Etowah High who lives in Port Victoria . " I think things will eventually quiet down in this neighborhood , but no one is ever going to forget this . I 've always thought this was a great neighborhood  --  better than most  --  but I 'll always think about what happened when I ride my bike down this street . " <p> Mourners flooded the Woodstock Funeral Home for two visitations in an effort to console Josh 's family . So many people went to Josh 's funeral , at Summit Baptist Church in Acworth , that many had to watch the services on closed-circuit television in rooms near the sanctuary . <p> Sheriff Roger Garrison read a statement from the Belluardo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision to remove Josh from breathing machines . <p> " The Belluardo family would like to thank their many friends who have responded to their crisis with prayers and words and deeds of kindness . We hope that this tragedy will be a strong reminder of how senseless violence is and how this life is both fragile and very precious , " the statement said . <p> " Our Christian faith , our family 's love and our friends ' support are sustaining us in these difficult days . We encourage you to place your faith in Christ , to cherish each loved one and to live with eternity in mind . " <p> Mixed riders : E.T . Booth Middle School students board buses after school .
