<p> Sipping on a glass of orange juice , Father Andrew Greeley gets a twinkle in his famous Irish eyes when asked how he 's able to accomplish all he does in a given day . Consider this : How many men could successfully become a priest , a renowned sociologist and best-selling author  --  all simultaneously and in a single lifetime ? <p> Greeley points to his first calling as central to answering that question . " I decided in the second grade that I wanted to be a priest and I 've never changed my mind . . . . The other things I do are all part of being a priest . " <p> Greeley points out  --  with only a trace of a smile  --  that " celibacy does leave you with a great deal of extra time . I do n't have a family and that makes a big difference . " That does n't mean one " gives up a family and children just to write books , " but the priesthood allows Greeley far more time than he otherwise would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> On top of that , the scholar/cleric claims to be " very , very organized , with a systematic work ethic . " And ( he adds with a barking laugh ) , " there 's the fact that I 'm glib . I 'm Irish . I have the Irish gift of facile talk . " <p> Facile he may be , but South Side native Andrew M. Greeley has been making headlines and snaring honors and attention for more than three decades . Thanks to his media appearances and best-selling novels , Greeley arguably could be called the best-known Roman Catholic priest in America today . <p> After completing his studies at St. Mary of the Lake Seminary in 1954 , Greeley went on to do his graduate work at the University of Chicago , where he received his master 's and doctorate degrees . Currently a professor of social sciences at the U. of C. and the University of Arizona , Greeley has written dozens of books and hundreds of articles ranging from popular fiction to scholarly tracts on sociology , education and religion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the country . <p> While he 's happy to talk about his eclectic range of interests during a chat over breakfast at a North Side hotel , Greeley stressed his vocation as a priest as the central focus of his life . " It 's still my core identity , " he said . <p> Recently , Greeley gathered a small sampling of the thousands of letters and e-mail communications he has received over the years . While he has no plans to publish them in book form , the letters point out an issue the priest says his literary critics often miss . " I would have thought it was patently obvious , but my books are all theological novels . They are novels of grace . Novels about God 's love . . . that 's why I write . <p> " The critics do n't always seem to get that , but the readers do and that 's enough , I guess . " <p> With a laugh , he pointed out , " The one thing I find fascinating is that I hear from so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I get more nice letters from Protestant ministers than I do from Catholic priests . " <p> In the last year , Greeley has published two new novels  --  Summer at the Lake , released in May , and The Bishop at Sea , which has just hit bookstores . <p> Greeley thinks a priest writing novels really should n't be all that , well , novel . " I think of a storyteller as a good metaphor for God , " said Greeley . " Because a storyteller creates his characters , then falls in love with them , but then discovers he ca n't make them do what wants them to do all the time  --  or even most of the time . " <p> Since first releasing The Magic Cup in 1975 , Greeley has gone on to write more than 30 novels , including such titles as The Cardinal Sins , Irish Gold , Rite of Spring and Occasion of Sin . For the author , " writer 's block " is never an issue . " I simply do n't get it . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What happens when I get into a story is the characters take over and tell the story for me . I 'm the man who just writes down what they 're saying and doing . . . . It 's a very strange experience . It 's not like I hallucinate or anything , but in a sense I do see them in my mind , hear their voices and know what they 're going to do . They just take over . I always know what the ending is going to be . . . the characters just take me there . " <p> Greeley points to legendary Chicago Daily News editor Finley Peter Dunne as an example . " He would write his editorials on one side of the page and have ( fictional character ) Dooley express his opinions on the other side . " Of course Dunne and Dooley were one and the same , but often there would be great disagreement between the paper 's editorial policy and Dooley 's " opinions . " <p> " People would tell Dunne , ' Well , Dooley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' And he would reply , ' Dooley has his own integrity . ' " <p> The lesson : Do n't confuse the author with the thoughts expressed by his characters . " Lots of people think I 'm Blackie Ryan ( the central character in many Greeley novels ) . So when I go out to dinner , often there 's a bottle of Bushmill 's waiting for me . I will tell them , ' Thank you , but I do n't drink whiskey . ' And the restaurant owner will say , ' But Blackie drinks whiskey ! ' . . . I 'm not Blackie , " said Greeley with a sigh . <p> While Greeley appears to often be at odds with the conservative philosophical approach of the Roman Catholic hierarchy , he 's quick to point out , " I certainly do n't question any fundamental doctrines . " <p> But he 's just as quick to illustrate the areas where he feels the church needs to improve . One is the role of women , something Greeley addresses in his latest novel , The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of women in the modern military . The priest says the way " the church has handled the treatment of women is scandalous in the strictest sense of the word . It 's shocking . . . it reduces them to second-class citizens , and I think that is a terrible mistake . " <p> Greeley also has firm ideas about how the church should redirect itself . Key issues for him include the vocation of the priesthood , the sexual challenges of the present day , and the lack of lay people 's input into the running of the church , beginning at the parish level . <p> " Catholicism is the only major denomination in North America that does n't give lay people any say in how their money is spent , " he said . That 's why there 's been a drop in contributions to Catholic churches , he said . <p> But Greeley thinks " if you asked the typical lay person what the biggest problem is , he 'd probably say , ' The quality of Sunday preaching . ' So many homilies are just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In the meantime , the busy Greeley continues to churn out the work . Along with teaching a Sociology of Religion course at the University of Chicago this semester , he has two new books  --  a prayer guide and a Christmas novella  --  being released along with The Bishop at Sea . <p> Going forward , " I have another novel , my third ' Irish ' novel , Irish Whiskey , coming out on St. Patrick 's Day . Then after that there will be Irish Mists , which I 'm working on right now . " <p> As the millennium approaches , Greeley takes a somewhat humorous approach . While understanding man 's need to mark historical milestones , he shares a favorite tale to make his point . <p> " There 's a story told that at the last millennium , in the year 1000 , all the royal courts of Europe went off to the hills to prepare for the return of Christ . <p> " Of course he did n't come , and only one court stayed in and worked on that first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know which court that was ? <p> " It was the Vatican , " said Greeley with a big laugh .
