Since 1989 , a new generation of low-cost electronic cameras has revolutionizing backyard astrophotography . Aficionados of the new technology refer to the wonder cameras simply as " CCDs , " which stands for " charge-coupled devices . " The big attraction of CCDs is that they allow you to capture very faint deep-sky objects with much shorter exposure times than are possible with conventional film . Astrophotographers have also found CCD cameras great for obtaining high-resolution images of the Moon and planets . CCD pictures are digital images  --  each picture is made of discrete picture elements called pixels . Each element records the level of light hitting it and sends that signal to a computer where the brightness value is stored as a number . The computer then reconstructs the image from the stored data and displays it on a monitor . Until recently , all amateur CCD images were black-and-whites . Now color imaging has arrived for CCDs . ASTRONOMY readers saw Jack Newton 's color CCD image of the Dumbbell Nebula on the February 1992 cover and , in the April issue , Don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color images is possible not because amateurs now have color CCD cameras  --  in fact , as the box on page 82 explains , astronomy there 's no such thing !  --  but because they are learning to convert black-and-white images into color ones using image-processing software . DIGITAL COLOR SHOPPING LIST The basic requirements for color CCD imaging are the same as for black-and-white CCD shots . First , you need a CCD camera . Entry-level models capable of exposures of several minutes now go for $600 to $2,000 . Most of these use a light-sensitive CCD chip with an array of 192 by 165 pixels . Cameras with larger arrays ( 1,000 by 1,000 pixels or more ) provide a wider field of view . These premium models once cost $60,000 but are now coming down in price to within reach of hobbyist budgets . Unlike conventional astrophotography , CCD imaging requires a computer . It needs to sit near your telescope where you can use it to control the camera as well as display and save images . ( CCD cameras sometimes permit up to 100 feet of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requires two people . ) The computer requirements vary with the type of CCD camera , but an IBM or compatible equipped with 2 megabytes of RAM , a 40-megabyte hard disk , and VGA graphics ( or an equivalent Macintosh ) is the usual minimum . Of course , you also need a telescope . Because CCD chips are very small , the field of view of most CCD cameras is narrow . This means you do n't need a large , long-focal-length telescope . In fact , telescopes considered small for conventional deep-sky photography do very well for CCD imaging . Telescopes with 400 to 900mm focal lengths ( such as 4-to 6-inch f/4 to f/6 scopes ) provide more than enough magnification for framing individual galaxies and nebulae onto the tiny chip . With the 6-inch f/5 reflector I use , the Whirlpool Galaxy fills half the frame of my 192x165-pixel CCD camera . For any long-exposure astrophotography , whether with film or a CCD , the scope should be equipped with a solid equatorial mounting and a smooth , reliable drive . Though CCD-camera exposures are often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long enough that you need to manually guide your telescope during the exposure . This requires either an off-axis guider or a separate guidescope . Finally , to process the raw image captured by the computer requires image-processing software . Many cameras come with basic programs , and more sophisticated software packages are available from third-party suppliers . To create color images , however , you need a program that can electronically synthesize three black-and-white images into a single color frame . I know of only two commercially available programs at the moment that can do this : Aldus PhotoStyler , a program that runs on a PC under Windows and Adobe PhotoShop , which runs on a Mac . A third program , Astronomical Image Processing , Version 2 , scheduled for release later in 1992 , will include the ability to create color images directly from CCD black-and-white originals . SPLITTING THE SPECTRUM Before venturing into the field of color CCD imaging , it 's best to be familiar with how any camera creates a color image . The underlying principle consists of recording the intensity of light at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your eyes . Accurately recording how bright each object in a scene looks in the light of several colors allows you to later reconstruct the scene in full color . This is exactly how color slides , color prints , color TV , and color CCD images work . Each of these media records the intensity of light in three colors  --  red , green , and blue . Mixing these primary colors allows you to create all the colors of the universe . Yellow and orange result when different amounts of red and green light combine . Magenta comes from mixing red and blue . The most familiar example of a three-color recording process is color photography . Color film is actually made from three layers of black-and-white film , one sensitive to red light , one to green , and one to blue . ( In practice , modern color films have a dozen or more layers , but the principle remains the same . ) When the film is developed , each light-sensitive layer takes on colored dyes in amounts that are proportional to the level of light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film in a slide projector or view a color print , where the original scene was red , we see red , and so on . Using multilayered color film is the obvious way to make color astrophotos . In the 1970s , amateur astronomer Ronald Royer perfected another technique , one borrowed from the earliest days of photography . His method of " tricolor astrophotography " is to shoot three black-and-white negatives through color filters . He combines the negatives by making black-and-white enlargements and rephotographing the enlargements through red , green , and blue filters onto color film . Though time-consuming , the technique takes advantage of the greater sensitivity and finer grain of black-and-white film compared to color . As a result , the final composite exhibits more nebulosity with more vivid colors and greater sharpness than is possible with a single original taken on color film . OLD TECHNIQUE , NEW TECHNOLOGY Before the invention of color film , manually combining three black-and-white photographs was the only method the pioneers of photography had to create true-color images . Today 's pioneers of amateur CCD imaging are at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image with an astronomical CCD camera is to take three exposures  --  one through a red filter , one through a green , and one through a blue  --  and electronically superimpose them on a computer screen . As recently as mid-1991 , no amateur I know had done this . I decided , with the help of my friends Donald Parker and Jack Newton , to make color pictures with a CCD . Don and lack are accomplished astrophotographers , and I enjoy writing computer software and reading arcane books about color theory . I 've also done my share of astrophotography and CCD imaging . In early 1991 Jack started taking digital images using one of the first-generation amateur-market CCD cameras . Although he bought it for guiding his 25-inch reflector , he got carried away taking images with it instead . Although we had talked about making color images , lack threw down the gauntlet when he sent me a set of pictures of the Ring Nebula that he had taken through color filters and challenged me to make a color image from them . Don started taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his 16-inch reflector and eyepiece projection . By the time I had figured out how to make color composites , Jupiter was lost in the evening glare . So Don 's first tricolor images , seen in earlier issues of ASTRONOMY , were of Saturn . Although shooting tricolor image sets may sound simple , it can be tricky to put into practice . For realistic results , you must use a filter set that separates the colors without much mixing . Wratten filters #25 red , #58 green , and #47 blue have long been considered the standard filter set for photographic tricolor work . For astronomical imaging , and nebular photography in particular , you need wider passbands to keep exposure times down . We recommend #23A light red , #56 light green , and #38A light blue for tricolor CCD imaging . You can buy these inexpensive filters at photo stores . For eyepiece projection shots of planets , all the major telescope companies sell filters that screw into eyepieces . Had Don and Jack simply shot images through these filters , however , infrared light leaking through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silicon used to make a CCD chip is very sensitive to infrared . ) So we added an extra filter to our filter sets , a Corion NR-400 . This filter blocks very little visible light but cuts out the infrared entirely . A one-inch-diameter NR-400 filter costs $127 . To make changing filters easy , Jack made a set of filter holders that allow him to pop the tricolor filters into his camera adapter without rotating or moving the camera , a very important consideration . For Don 's setup , he and his friend Bill Douglas constructed a motor-driven filter wheel that allows Don to change filters rapidly without touching the telescope . With Jupiter and Saturn , you have less than two minutes , and with Mars less than five minutes , to obtain a tricolor set before the planet rotates so much that the combined color image smears . At the 1992 Winter Star Party in Florida , Jack took four sets of tricolor images . These images were possibly the first color CCD images taken at any star party . To do it , Jack borrowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as a portable computer to capture images from a prototype CCD camera Jack was testing . From experimental efforts such as these , Don , Jack , and I have learned some important lessons . Tricolor frames must be exposed well enough that the images are much stronger than the electronic noise . In Florida , the ten-minute exposures of deep-sky objects we shot through the blue and green filters were barely sufficient . Longer exposures or a faster telescope would have improved our black-and-white original images and made for better color composites . The color filters needed for tricolor imaging exact a severe toll on light , as Don 's best images of Jupiter and Saturn testify . The exposures , which are made with Don 's 16-inch f/6 Newtonian using eyepiece projection at f/22 , can run as long as 18 seconds for Saturn through the blue filter and 2 seconds through the red filter . However long these sound , corresponding exposures on film would have been ten times longer . GETTING IT TOGETHER If you were doing photographic tricolor work , after taking the three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for about six hours . But with CCD images the computer becomes your darkroom . Nevertheless , once you realize that software , a keyboard , and a mouse have replaced your trusty enlarger and trays of chemicals , making a digital color composite is much like making a color print in the darkroom . You go through the same steps . With photography you first put your negative into the color enlarger . With digital imaging you start by loading the three black-and-white images into the computer . In photography I always began by making a test print just to get some feeling for the density and color balance of the negative . In computer processing , you can do a quick trial merge of the images . ( With the right software , merging the color images is a matter of three clicks of the mouse . ) Now you evaluate the test strip . If the three images are not in perfect register , you nudge them around a bit . Hmm , it looks like the red image should go three pixels up and two pixels left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they fit . After three or four tries you should have them reasonably close , and you can pay attention to the color balance . If you 've made prints in the darkroom , you probably know how to change exposures and printing filters to make an image a bit redder and just a touch darker . With the computer , you optimize the brightness and contrast of each image first . Then you combine the images . After you evaluate the resulting color image  --  maybe it 's still a bit too green , so you brighten the red image a tad  --  you try again . If you are adept with a computer and understand color printing from the darkroom , you should be able to assemble a color image from a raw tricolor CCD image set in under an hour . Remarkably few pitfalls occur in creating color images on a computer . The most important thing to remember is this : process all three black-and-white images in the same way . Image-processing software gives you a palette of enhancement options : filtering , sharpening , contrast boost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maximum detail in the original . Fine , go to it . But if you computer enhance one of the images without processing the other two with exactly the same steps , you 'll get ghastly results  --  vivid color rings around all the bright stars , a violent purple background , or a bright yellow nebula . Of course there 's no penalty for making strange images ; you have n't wasted paper or chemicals . All you 've spent is your own time . And you can always try again . So there you have it . Color CCD imaging provides amateurs with a satisfying sense of exploring a new realm . But in fact the newest technologies make use of tried-and-true methods . Although today 's CCD cameras are ten times more sensitive to light than photographic film , the basic ideas behind color imaging with this state-of-the-art medium and the 150-year-old medium of photography remain the same . The Digital Orion Nebula was created by first using a CCD camera to take black-and-white images through red , green , and blue filters . These three images were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WHY NOT A COLOR CCD CHIP ? Producing color images by taking three separate black-and-white exposures and combining them seems like a tedious process . Why not use a color camera ? After all , home video cameras use charge-coupled device ( CCD ) chips and they produce color images . Why ca n't someone produce a color CCD camera for astronomical imaging ? The answer lies in how CCD cameras are built . The CCD chips in black-and-white cameras have a surface divided into thousands of rectangles ( depicted in the left diagram ) . Each rectangle is a light-sensitive diode detector . When light strikes the diode , it generates an electrical signal that is stored on the chip . The signal from each diode is then read out by shifting the signal from diode to diode across the chip until the entire array 's signal has been read into the computer . In CCD 's made for color camcorders ( shown at right ) , an array of microscopic red , green , and blue filters is deposited right on the diodes during manufacture of the chip . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which sounds ideal . But there 's a catch . Video CCDs need to work very quickly ( 30 exposures per second ) so they use an arrangement in which alternate rows of diodes are covered with an opaque mask . When the chip is read out , the signals from the colored filtered diodes are shifted over one row to the diodes behind the opaque masks . Once there , the signals are protected from further exposure and can be read out as the next exposure is made . This scheme prevents smearing in moving video images but it means that half the chip 's surface is covered with an opaque layer . The half that is exposed to light is covered by red , green , or blue filters . If a pinpoint star image happens to fall on an opaque diode , it wo n't be recorded . If it falls on an exposed diode , it gets recorded only in the color of the filter that covers that diode . These limitations rule out the present generation of color CCD cameras for high-resolution astronomical imaging . GETTING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouse you can manipulate digital images on a computer . It 's easy to sharpen an image , change its contrast , or enhance its color . What starts out looking like a fuzzy , featureless original can , with the right processing , be turned into a detailed , vivid image , all without the mess and expense of photographic film , paper , or chemicals .
