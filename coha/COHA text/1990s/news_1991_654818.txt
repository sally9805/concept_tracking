<p> TO Cree and Inuit Indians , the James Bay territory is home . They have hunted , trapped , fished , and buried their ancestors there for 5,000 years . <p> To Hydro-Quebec , an enormous hydroelectric company owned by the provincial government of Quebec , James Bay territory is a sparsely populated area of untapped resources ; millions of gallons of wild water just waiting to be channeled into power . Enough power for everyone - Quebeckers , New Englanders , and heavy industries . <p> The two groups are face-to-face over how the James Bay territory will be used . Last year on Earth Day , a group of Cree Indians canoed from Lake Champlain to New York City to gain support for halting James Bay II , the planned second part of a massive hydro-electric project owned by Hydro-Quebec . <p> This year , a group of Crees , economists , and environmentalists are again touring the Northeast . <p> And environmentalist David Brower , who founded Friends of the Earth and Earth Island Institute , has lent his weight . <p> States as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power . Environmentalists fear the company is using a $6 million advertising budget to influence those communities to vote in favor of renewing the contracts at town meetings . In Vermont , out of 16 towns relying on independent power companies , eight have voted pro-Hydro , three have voted against . Residents in Morrisville are suing the town for not allowing the anti-Hydro group to speak at the town meeting , says Anne Stewart , director of the Northeast Alliance to Protect James Bay . <p> " We are here to ask that the contracts between the power utilities in the Northeastern states and Hydro-Quebec be canceled , or at least postponed pending the outcome of Cree court actions designed to force public hearings on the social , environmental , and economic impacts of the projects , " Cree Grand Chief Matthew CoonCome said at the United Nations . <p> If completed , the project will have taken parts of 15 wild rivers . Through a series of 21 dams plus hundreds of dikes , it will divert the flow into three rivers that will spill into Hudson and James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tunnels to carry water between reservoirs . <p> James Bay II , says Bill Namagoose , executive director of the Cree nation , will submerge traditional caribou-calving grounds , trap lines , and the graves of the Cree 's ancestors under the giant reservoirs . <p> The Indians ' main food staple , fish , has already been tainted by mercury from earlier James Bay I projects . The Cree , Mr. Namagoose says , are afraid that the project will mean the end of their culture . <p> " We 'll become a statistic , " he says . " The Cree lived here . " <p> " You have to understand that this is a huge area ; 15 rivers sounds like a lot , but there are hundreds of rivers , " says Jacques-Andr142 Couture , head of media relations of Hydro-Quebec . The company acknowledges the presence of mercury which has been found when reservoirs were dug , but says it will be gone in 30 years . <p> Environmentalists say the changes will destroy coastal wetlands , affect migratory bird patterns , and disturb the delicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project will cost far more than it will bring in . The total project will cost $45 billion , 70 percent of which will be borrowed by Hydro-Quebec . With Quebec 's small population , that 's a high debt ratio , say observers . A Canadian bond-rating agency last week put Quebec government bonds , including those of Hydro-Quebec , on credit watch . <p> Hydro-Quebec says James Bay II will send only 6 percent of its power to the United States , that most of it is for Quebec , where 70 percent of the homes are heated by electricity . There is debate over how much electricity will be needed . <p> " We think that environmentally it is the best way to produce electricity , " says Mr. Couture . " Our demand is increasing 2 percent a year , even with conservation measures . " Others say his estimate is too high , that Quebec has a low birthrate . <p> New England had a similar growth rate , says William Sheperdson , manager of public information for New England Power Pool ( NEPOOL ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the regional economic doldrums . NEPOOL has two contracts with Hydro-Quebec , one of which will last to the year 2000 . <p> " That energy does help us in New England displace the use of foreign oil and fossil fuels , " says Mr. Sheperdson . <p> James Bay II is supposed to begin in 1995 . Hydro-Quebec is poised to begin building roads this spring . But the project is running into snags . <p> Some cities and towns in New England are not renewing their contracts to buy Hydro-Quebec power . The State of Maine canceled its contract in 1989 . And the Quebec government recently rejected an environmental study by Hydro-Quebec . <p> Hydro-Quebec began initial construction on James Bay I in the early 1970s , before environmental-impact assessments were made or land-rights issues resolved . <p> The Cree opposed the project , but the Quebec government said they had no standing . A Canadian judge ruled that the Cree did have standing , and halted the project . The decision was overturned by an appeals court . <p> By that time , work had started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Quebec government to give them greater control over future projects . That resulted in the 1975 agreement , which authorized Hydro-Quebec to give the Cree and other tribes $125 million , to be paid over 20 years in bond issues . <p> It set up strict environmental assessments . In return , Hydro-Quebec got the right to use some of the land . How much is still being hammered out in court . <p> " There are a lot of reasons why this is a bad idea , " says Paul Messerschmidt , a consultant with the Goodman Group , a Boston-based energy consultant firm hired by the Cree . " One of the most important is , it 's particularly not economically sound , " he says . <p> " Canada has spent in excess of $50 billion on the project . Can they sell power higher in New England to justify what they spend ? <p> " It does n't make sense for US utilities to buy the most expensive source of power first . " <p> Bill Namagoose , looking up at a brightly glowing chandelier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We do n't want to be remembered as a lamp . "
