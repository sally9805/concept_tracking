T WAS SOME THREE YEARS ago that I first became acquainted with Heywood Mudcatt of Tattermore . We were both attending a dinner party at the home of D and fell into conversation concerning heat boils ja subject of which I possess some knowledge accounted for by my years in the Gobi ) . For half an hour we amused ourselves with an exchange of boillore , then the dinner bell sounded and we took our places at the table . <p> The meal , as I remember , was a splendid spread , radiating outward from the central main dish of wild duck . With much passion , all members of the party embarked upon the consumption of that drool-inspiring banquet . All , that is , save Mudcatt , who merely folded his arms and smiled . His plate sat unfulfilled , brightly naked and vaguely disturbing . <p> Our hosts seemed unconcerned with Mudcatt 's abstinence . I leaned over to D and whispered , " Does n't the man eat ? " <p> " What ? Oh , Mudcatt , " D shrugged . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . Not in public , at any rate . Some gastronomic malady , I believe . He is a queer rotter . " <p> Unaware of our whisperings , Mudcatt continued to just sit there and smile and eat nothing . <p> Over the next . two years , I crossed paths with Mudcatt on several occasions , usually at dinner parties . Through these random encounters , I grew to actually like the fellow . His wit was of an excellent degree and his knowledge was not limited to boils . Indeed , he could discourse on a sparkling array of subjects - ice cubes , masking tapes , pygmy architecture , nasal hygiene - the man was an encyclopedia with limbs . <p> And yet ... and yet .... <p> When the dinner bell pealed and the assemblage sat down to eat , I would look over at that empty disk of porcelain and at Mudcatt 's folded arms and unslumping smile , and I would feel my entire being tingle with something unexplainable , something uneasy , something like ... was it dread ? <p> Still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter , I received a written invitation to visit Mudcatt at his estate , I accepted . What struck me as singular about the invitation was that it was for dinner . Dinner ! Would I then get to see a fork lifted to that virgin smile ? Would there be food upon that fork and , if so , of what nature would it be ? How , for the Love of God , did Heywood Mudcatt take his nourishment ? I was soon to find out . <p> I showed up at Tattermore Estate close to dinnertime . I was received by a wizened stick-figure of a butler who led me to a comfortable drawing room , then departed to notify his master of my arrival . Mudcatt soon joined me and furnished me with some praiseworthy brandy , though he himself did not drink any . We chatted for a while about shoe polish and clothespins . As always , Mudcatt 's observations were dazzling . <p> " It seems to me , " he remarked , " that ' shoe polish ' is an unearned bit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can tell , does precious little toward the outcome of a decently polished shoe . Why , if it were not for the grace of human motivation , the so-called ' polish ' would languish uselessly in its tin or , at best , lie caked upon the surface of a shoe like some vile layer of excrement . " <p> " Hear , hear ! " I cried . The man was , unquestionably , brilliant . <p> The dinner bell rang . The bell . Was it my imagination or did that particular bell ring longer than any dinner bell I had ever heard ? In point of fact , it did not ring - it tolled . My blood went thin . I was seized by a sense of keen apprehension . What nameless repast awaited me in Mudcatt 's mysterious dining chamber ? <p> " Come , " he said . " It 's time to eat . " <p> As if in a daze , I followed my host toward destiny . <p> When I set eyes upon the dinner table , an audible sigh gushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the meal awaiting us ; on the contrary , it was a swell spread . Turkey , ham , and fish , encampments of steaming vegetables and mounds of fresh fruit all lay sprawled out tastefully , invitingly , upon a white linen tablecloth . Candles in brass holders completed the effect . <p> We were seated by the narrow butler , and I was served wine . Mudcatt said a few words , sotto voce , to the old man , who gave a meager bow and left the room . My host smiled at me . <p> " Well , dig in , my friend . " <p> I complied , heaping my plate with healthy portions of each dish . I was delighted , not to say amazed , to see Mudcatt doing the same . In fact , by the time he had finished serving himself , his plate was almost lost beneath a pyramid of food . <p> I began to laugh <p> " My dear Mudcatt ! I must say , it is a relief to see such evidence of your appetite . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought . I 'm just glad to see you have a bit of the glutton in you . " <p> Mudcatt gave a chuckle . His fork and knife were now in his hands . I was reaching for my own fork when the butler re-entered . <p> I froze . My eyes widened and my jaw dropped like a meteor . A geyser of terror came shooting up from my lower abdomen to the roof of my head . Cradled there in the spindly arms of the old servant was a monstrously huge bottle filled to the top with a foul red substance . <p> Mudcatt was grinning demoniacally . <p> " You see , I like ketchup .... " <p> My heart missed a beat . <p> " On everything ! " He began to cackle . <p> Staggering under the weight of the bottle , the old scarecrow approached his master . Mudcatt screwed off the cap and the servant tipped the lip over the pyramid of food . My mind reeled with inconceivable horror as the loathsome red ketchup oozed ravagingly over Mudcatt 's plate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fork into the vile , hellish corruption that was his dinner . He plugged his mouth with the hideous food-sludge and , upon devouring the unutterable contents of his plate , he abandoned his cutlery and thrust his arm into the terrible neck of the ungodly bottle . He began feeding directly on the ghastly condiment . <p> At this point I bolted . <p> I ran frantically through the house searching for the elusive front door . When I glanced behind , I saw Mudcatt and the butler , smeared in red , climbing over furniture in their diabolic pursuit of me . The pair looked far less human now - I saw them for what they were . They were in appearance something like foul , diseased earthworms with huge hellborn mandibles that dripped perversion as they moved . The whole scene was one of indescribable horror , so indescribable that I must resort to long , ornate , vague descriptions that , in truth , describe nothing , but leave the reader with a fiendish , watery , repulsive impression of many hideous syllables . <p> I found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been over a year since that damnable evening . Mudcatt has vanished from society and I , for the most part , am a hermit , shunning the company of my fellows . <p> On occasion , if energetically pressed , I may attend a dinner , but even then , even then , I do not eat . I fold my arms and smile , but I do not eat . <p> Author Affiliation
