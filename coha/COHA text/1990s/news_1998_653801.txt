<p> When the bankrupt Western Pacific Airlines stopped flying last month , Frontier Airlines , one of its rivals at Denver 's sprawling new airport , offered to honor its outstanding tickets , splitting the revenue 50-50 . But just when Frontier thought it had sealed the deal , United Airlines , which controls more than 70 percent of the seats flown in and out of Denver , swooped in and reached its own agreement . <p> " United offered us a better deal , " said Robert A. Peiser , Western Pacific 's president and chief executive . <p> Sam Addoms , the chief executive of Frontier , acknowledged that United flies to all the cities served by Western Pacific , while Frontier had some gaps . But the effect of the deal was that United , a unit of the UAL Corporation , had denied Frontier a shot at winning the loyalty of Western Pacific 's customers . <p> " Those moves might be construed as a means to increase their monopoly status , " he said . <p> It is hardly an academic issue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a growing debate over whether the major carriers are unfairly reining in their smaller rivals , curbing their growth and even blocking their access to new markets . More is at stake than simply the number of carriers flying out of a particular airport  --  ticket prices tend to drop when competition increases , and rise when it narrows , studies have shown . <p> The Justice Department has started an antitrust investigation of the biggest airlines and the Transportation Department is on the verge of issuing guidelines that would define for the first time when the Government might take action against a carrier for competing unfairly . In addition , several bills have been introduced in Congress that aim to blunt the dominance of the big carriers and promote competition . <p> As a result , the lines are quickly being drawn for a bitter battle that pits the airlines against a loose contingent of travel agents , consumer activists , business groups , local communities and the Clinton Administration . Both sides say they are the true champions of deregulation , which everyone agrees brought affordable air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airlines say that their critics are trying to turn back the clock and " reregulate " the industry . AMR 's American Airlines and United recently formed the Airline Competition Committee to celebrate the 20th anniversary of deregulation and " educate " the public about its benefits . Along with Northwest Airlines and Delta Air Lines , American and United gave $1.1 million last year in Federal campaign contributions , accounting for 72 percent of all airline industry donations , according to a study by the Center for Responsive Politics . <p> Critics of the big airlines respond that they are merely trying to remove the last vestiges of regulation , which they say have been exploited by the major carriers to fend off new competitors . But they are clearly eager for the Government to take a stronger hand in helping new low-cost airlines . <p> " Our goal is to expand deregulation to meet the original intent of the Congress , " said Ivan Michael Schaeffer , president of Woodside Travel Trust , a consortium of 132 travel agencies that cater mostly to businesses . " No one in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the industry . " <p> What corporate travel agents , businesses and many communities are most concerned about are the so-called fortress hubs at key airports around the country that are dominated by the large carriers . In addition to United 's pre-eminence in Denver , it and American control 84 percent of the available seats in Chicago . Northwest Airlines has 79 percent of the capacity in Detroit and an even greater 82 percent in Minneapolis . Delta flies 80 percent of the seats out of Atlanta . <p> As the carriers have tightened their grip on major airports , the prices for walk-on fares , which are mostly purchased by business travelers , have soared to record levels . Many members of Congress , along with local officials , complain that the lack of competition is hampering economic development because businesses can not afford to be situated where travel costs are too high . <p> One Federal study of the impact of deregulation found that fares at hub airports dominated by a single carrier were 22 percent higher than what was charged in other markets . To Washington policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low-cost airlines modeled on the success of Southwest Airlines . <p> For a time , the approach seemed to work . A 1996 study concluded that passengers traveling in markets with low-cost competition saved $6.3 billion a year , $2.6 billion of which came from large hub airports . <p> But a month after that study was issued , a Valujet plane crashed in Florida , killing all 110 people aboard . The subsequent discovery of numerous safety violations by the carrier turned many passengers away from low-cost airlines . Applications to start new discount carriers slowed to a trickle . <p> Before the crash , Valujet had proved popular with many travelers . At its peak in 1995 , it flew 7 percent of the available seats out of its base in Atlanta and was growing fast . Critics of the big carriers believe that the Valujet disaster was seen as an opportunity by the major airlines to knock off other small competitors before they became a threat  --  a charge that the big carriers deny . <p> Whatever their motivation , large airlines have a number of competitive tools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rivals . These range from exclusive deals with large corporate customers to discounts for travel agencies that book a high percentage of their tickets on one airline . But the most potent way of driving out competition is so-called predatory behavior : cutting fares and then flooding a small airline 's routes with cheap seats until it is forced to abandon them . <p> That is exactly what the Detroit-based Spirit Airlines contends Northwest did on the Detroit-Philadelphia route in the aftermath of the Valujet crash . Northwest matched Spirit 's $49 one-way fare and added more seats to its existing service . <p> After Spirit stopped flying the route in September 1996 , Northwest reduced capacity and raised its prices . " Their strategy only made sense if their goal was to push us out of the market , " said Mark Kahan , Spirit 's executive vice president . <p> Northwest denied that it was doing anything more than competing aggressively . " Spirit Air is complaining because we matched their prices , " said Jon Austin , a spokesman . " That is the central tenet of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of using similar tactics against Reno Air , which filed an antitrust suit against Northwest last March . <p> In addition , Frontier has a litany of complaints of unfair practices by United . While United vigorously denies the charges , Frontier 's complaints were apparently substantive enough to get the Justice Department to begin its antitrust investigation early last year . The Department of Transportation also began investigating United and other big carriers , with officials finding evidence of some foul play . <p> " I 've seen dozens of examples in routinely reported data where fare matching and undercutting by major airlines have been taking place , " said Patrick V. Murphy , Deputy Assistant Secretary of Transportation , in a speech last fall . <p> But predatory behavior is one of the thorniest areas of antitrust law . Judges are extremely reluctant to rule in favor of those who say they are victims because it raises the specter of denying consumers the benefit of what at first appear to be wider choices and low prices . <p> " Virtually every student of antitrust law will tell you that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist , " said Robert L. Crandall , American 's combative chairman and chief executive . <p> But in a speech last year , Roger W. Fones , who is leading the Justice Department 's antitrust investigation of the airlines , said that the airline business was one of the few industries where predatory behavior could be demonstrated to be a rational strategy . <p> Still , the cloudy legal questions mean that the large carriers would likely fight any lawsuit brought by the Government , a battle that could last for years . " Drafting a court order that gets surgically at these problems is difficult because it says ' do n't charge such low prices , ' " said one Justice Department lawyer who insisted on anonymity . <p> The Department of Transportation says it has more far-reaching powers to rein in the big airlines than the Justice Department . It can levy fines and even revoke an airline 's operating license . But the department has never used these powers against a major airline for competing unfairly , choosing instead to pressure carriers behind the scenes . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year that they would issue them in January . Then they were pushed back to February . The department had been planning to release them last week but held off again . <p> Airline executives have been appealing to the White House in an effort to weaken the guidelines , leading some to credit them with the delay . But a White House official who requested anonymity said that the only problem was that the Transportation Department 's 15-page draft needed to be in plainer English . <p> Administration officials may be nervous that the rules will appear to prevent the airlines from lowering their fares , drawing the wrath of a public whipped up by the carriers . <p> " What kind of competition policy precludes large carriers , or anybody , from selling large numbers of seats at low prices ? " said Cyril D. Murphy , vice president of regulatory affairs at United . <p> In a speech on Jan. 30 , Rodney E. Slater , the Transportation Secretary , said that the Administration deliberately chose not to pursue an " enforcement strategy " against the major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us guidance , ' " he added . " And that is what we will do . " <p> Whether this means the agency will use its enforcement powers if airlines violate the new guidelines is not clear . Critics of the airlines hold out little hope that the Administration will take tough action . Instead , they place more faith in Congress . The bills that have been introduced would open up more landing rights at the country 's busiest airports for upstart carriers and force the Department of Transportation to respond to complaints of predatory behavior within 90 days . <p> But a large number of lawmakers are opposed to new legislation . At a hearing early this month , Senator Slade Gorton , Republican of Washington , the chairman of the aviation subcommittee of the Commerce Committee , argued that " telling airlines how to schedule flights and what fares to charge is a cure far worse than the disease . " <p> Even Ed Faberman , executive director of the Air Carrier Association , the chief lobby for the upstart airlines , acknowledged that many small carriers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both . " No one is pretending that the only reason start-ups are failing is because of the big carriers , " he said . <p> Still , said Mr. Addoms , Frontier 's chief executive , deregulation should not mean that " anything goes . " <p> " We are going to have a debate about this stuff for the first time in 20 years , " he added . " Everyone is going to get their oar in , and I am sure it is going to be loud .
