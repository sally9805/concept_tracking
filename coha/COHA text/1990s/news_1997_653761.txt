<p> THE American worker is still disappearing . He is continuing to lose his spot to the American worker-owner , the person who , through 401(k) and other retirement plans , holds both a company job and company stock . But while a bull market and dreams of worker capitalism lead some people to put a happy face on this change , behind the smile are growing fears : of companies burdened by lawsuits and of workers facing grave risks to their retirement . <p> These worries are strong enough to have inspired Congressional bills and company revisions of 401(k) 's and other defined-contribution plans . But , from the numbers , you would not suspect such deep misgivings : About 17 percent of all assets in 401(k) plans were invested in company stock in 1993 , the most recent year for which Labor Department data are available , according to Douglas L. Kruse and Joseph R. Blasi , professors of management and labor relations at Rutgers University . <p> And in an annual survey of its client companies , Buck Consultants of Secaucus , N.J. , found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ option jumped to 45 percent in 1996 , from 38 percent the year before . The National Center for Employee Ownership in Oakland , Calif. , estimates that defined-contribution plans now hold more than $300 billion in company stock , up from $100 billion in 1992 . That increase far outstrips the 86 percent rise in the Standard &; Poor 's 500-stock index since then . <p> Within plans , company stock looms larger , too . Among big companies that offer company stock in 401(k) 's , an average of 31 percent of plan assets are now invested in that equity , according to another survey by Buck Consultants . The Institute of Management and Administration , a research organization in New York , found an average of 42 percent for a similar set of companies . <p> The fears over this trend are far from theoretical . Consider lawsuits . Last June , an employee of Color Tile , a retailer of home-decorating materials based in Fort Worth , sued the company over its 401(k) plan . The reason was that the plan was invested mostly in company stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bankrupt . A few years before , 10,000 employees of the retailer Carter Hawley Hale , who were required to put their 401(k) money into company stock , had the same shock when their employer declared bankruptcy . <p> The lawsuits go beyond 401(k) 's . The trustees of numerous employee stock ownership plans , which buy company stock for employees , are being accused of conflict-of-interest problems , said Stuart Lewis , managing partner at Silverstein &; Mullens , a law firm in Washington that specializes in employee benefits . <p> " As the ESOP area illustrates , when you get company stock in a plan , you have a much higher potential for lawsuits , " Mr. Lewis said . <p> THE company-stock trend can also undermine the standard advice of financial planners : to diversify assets . True , many 401(k) and other defined-contribution plans offer other investment choices besides company stock and property . And many employees have pension plans to fall back on if problems arise in another retirement account . <p> But no professional money manager would ever invest 42 percent of a portfolio in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Scarborough Group , referring to the estimate by the Institute of Management and Administration . <p> " It 's pretty alarming , " Mr. Evans said . <p> The newly issued Labor Department data contain some vivid examples of the lure of the company stock . At Union Oil of California , which has $360 million in 401(k) assets , 96 percent was in company stock . Company stock is 97 percent of Archer Daniels Midland 's $153 million plan , and 99 percent of the $220 million at Tele-Communications Inc . <p> Moreover , as these examples suggest , there are no legal limits on the concentration of company stock in 401(k) plans . Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 , known as Erisa , traditional pensions can have no more than 10 percent of their money invested in company stock . But 401(k) 's are specifically exempt from this rule . <p> REVERSING the trend may not be easy . Many workers and companies are strongly drawn to the company stock . <p> With stock prices soaring , for example , many workers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan option . Mr. Evans said many employees are intensely loyal to their companies and are willing to put their money where their mouths are . <p> General Electric , for example , offers company stock in its 401(k) plan . But it also has several other investment alternatives and provides no incentives  --  discounts , for instance  --  for choosing the company stock . And G.E . also says nothing about its stock 's performance , no matter how good it is . <p> " We do n't tell this to our employees , " said Richard Dunn , program manager for qualified plans . " We do n't want to be viewed as pushing the stock . " <p> Despite these measures , 41 percent of the G.E . plan assets are in company stock , according to the 1993 Labor Department data . Mr. Dunn , who had figures through the end of 1996 , says the amount has now reached 58 percent . <p> Companies tend to offer a company-stock choice out of the same loyalty that leads workers to choose it . No company dislikes having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And using incentive pay  --  tying employees ' fortunes to their company 's to improve performance  --  is particularly popular among managers these days . These attractions lead many companies not only to offer company stock but also to put it in the forefront of the plan . For example , most companies that offer matching contributions  --  which account for about 55 percent of all the money going into 401(k) plans  --  do so solely in the form of company stock , according to the National Center for Employee Ownership . Many companies also set minimum periods for holding company stock , and some even require plan participants to put some of their money into the equity . <p> Beginning June 30 , if it receives Labor Department approval , the Travelers Group will even give 401(k) participants stock options on the company 's equity . <p> These and other special rules for company stock may open employers to claims that they are not looking solely to the investing interests of their workers , as Erisa and other laws require , said Lance D. Tane , managing director at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ N.J. Sponsors are supposed to provide workers with objective information on plan options , he explained . How can matches that apply only to company stock , he asked , be considered objective ? <p> Conflicts can lead plan sponsors to fail in their fiduciary duties . While plan administrators are obliged to disclose investment risks , for instance , they are also company employees and do not want to lose their jobs , said Mr. Lewis , the lawyer in Washington . <p> Mr. Evans has seen company newsletters in which articles about the company were excerpted with negative comments from analysts cut out . " Some of the information is so biased on the upside that it 's not fair , " he said . <p> Mr. Lewis said : " Failure to give balanced disclosure is going to put you in big trouble . If you mislead employees , the courts will find a way to stick it to you . " <p> Sometimes , the tension between company and worker interests can become extremely taut . In the Color Tile case  --  which is scheduled to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now in settlement negotiations  --  the participants ' lawyers argue that the company should not have invested worker money in the company 's stock and properties as it went deeper into debt . At precisely such times , of course , the corporate pressure to continue the investments may be the strongest . <p> The present and former administrators of the Color Tile plan " vigorously deny that they ever did anything wrong , " said Michael Keeley , a partner at Strasburger &; Price , the administrators ' lawyers . <p> Or imagine that executives know of a forthcoming merger that will depress their company 's stock . As corporate insiders , they can not warn participants that their investments may be at risk . But as plan sponsors they have fiduciary duties to protect those participants . <p> " There will be increased lawsuits in cases where executives knew the stock could drop because of a merger or acquisition and the participants were not informed , " predicted Larry Mylnechuk , president of Integra Associates , a 401(k) consulting firm in Lake Oswego , Ore . <p> SOME @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risks . For instance , while General Motors requires workers to put half of their contributions into company stock , the company recently liberalized its transfer rules to let them move out of the stock at year-end , no matter how close to the end of the year the contribution was made . <p> " Overall flexibility was an issue , " said William Cowell , director of stock plans at General Motors . <p> The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company , which provides companies with retirement plans , is putting together an investment option containing the stock of the participating company along with shares of at least half a dozen other companies . <p> " While companies have a lot of pride in their own stock , there is nonetheless a dangerous lack of diversification out there , " said Jeffrey B. Norris , the company 's vice president for pension product marketing . " This is an attempt to address that . " <p> In Washington , Senator Barbara Boxer , Democrat of California , has introduced a bill to curb company powers in this sphere . Specifically , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worker contributions go to company stock , if 10 percent or more of plan assets are already in the equity . <p> Such measures seem to portend a more realistic era . " For a while , people were looking at company stocks as a free lunch , " said Richard Koski , national director of pre-retirement and financial planning at Buck Consultants . " We have come down to earth . " <p> Financial planners preach diversification , but in many workers ' 401(k) plans one investment looms large : shares of their employer 's stock . Table lists 10 largest 401(k) plans in which 90 percent or more of assets were in company stock and property , and those that had the largest dollar investments in the employer 's stock or property , from 1993 data .
