In 1991 , at the height of the recession , employers were passing out 2,600 pink slips a day . Some of us did n't even bother to dust off our resumes . Instead , we started businesses of our own . It is estimated that Black women are behind just 3 percent of all businesses owned by women , but according to the Census Bureau , 900,000 new businesses crop up each year . Here , three home-based entrepreneurs tell us that , yes , working from home is the way to go  --  but that contrary to popular belief , they hardly ever have time to catch the soaps . JUDITH HOOPER DESIGNER-CERAMICIST For many work-at-home women , serious business started when they simply decided to do what they like . That 's what happened to Judith Hooper . " What I do for a living is also my hobby , " says the home-furnishings designer and ceramicist of her 10-year-old company , Tablewear , under whose name she manufactures napkin rings , picture frames and other things ceramic . " I do not consider this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 43 , exercises each morning , returns phone calls at 11:00 A.M. , and settles down to her artwork around 2:00 P.M. After a dinner break , she works past midnight . THE NEED TO BE ON HER OWN Self-employed since 1973 , Hooper admits she has always favored working at home . " I 'm a night person , " she explains . " It was hard for me to get to jobs at 9:00 A.M. " After leaving Brooklyn 's Pratt Institute , Hooper , a native of Metuchen , New Jersey , did illustrations for fashion and children 's books and worked part-time as a model . " I could only get jobs drawing Black people , and there was n't enough work doing that alone . When I turned 30 , I decided I had to do something else . A HOBBY BECOMES A BUSINESS " In 1981 I made a Japanese mask for a friend , from a homemade clay of flour , salt and water . I baked it in my oven and painted it with nail polish , using an old recipe for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped her design a collection of clay napkin rings in motifs ranging from traditional to Pierrot to Henry VIII . She filled a straw basket with samples and visited chic Manhattan boutiques . " A Madison Avenue shop ordered 300 pieces  --  and needed them in three weeks ! I had to stay up nights making everything because clay takes up to two weeks to dry . I was completely exhausted by the time I left the shop with the check in my hand . " When an upscale fabric firm asked to sell her napkin rings , Hooper " realized this was serious business , " she says . " I made a commitment to Tablewear . To make it a real business , I needed a kiln . " In 1983 Hooper bought a mini model kiln at a pottery shop , taught herself to use it , then made a deal with a New York wholesaler of unique handmade items , which chose many of her pieces . " A selling point they used was the rarity of a Black woman artist creating tabletop furnishings . This made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artists a chance in the field and to cut the pigeonholing . " IMPROVING CASH FLOW Hooper now brings in about $900 a month from Tablewear . She matches that income by creating set designs for photography and from royalties on designs she has licensed to manufacturers . Ironically , Hooper notes , the process of creating her mainstay  --  napkin rings  --  can get a little repetitive and is n't always as lucrative as she would like . When she gets bored with a mold , she designs something new . " Recently I needed to get away from napkin rings . I 've added picture frames , Christmas ornaments , jewelry and napkins , " she says . Some rings , with matching napkins , retail for up to $70 a set in boutiques such as Material Possessions in Chicago . The designer muses at her own good fortune . " My start-up costs were nail polish and lacquer . I made my own business cards , and I chose the name Tablewear because I am really dressing your table . " CHARMAINE COTHRAN CATERER Sitting in art-appreciation class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got an idea . She had just been laid off from her supervisory job at a bank and had come back to school to finish her B.A. degree . " I was sitting there wondering how I could move forward and make some money , " says 31-year-old Cothran . " The idea for a catering business just came to me . I scribbled five pages of notes , and then I went to the library and did some entrepreneurial research . I enrolled in a ten-week business-development course at the local university , and I was on my way . " In May 1990 , Cothran 's brainstorm gave birth to Maids &; Meals Catering , a food-preparation service geared to parties . " My original idea was a catering service for people who wish they could leave the table and have us clean up too , " she says . In the second bedroom of her apartment in Blue Island , Illinois , Cothran has an office with a desk , a computer and a phone with a separate line . " I may be out all day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handle paperwork and menus from six to ten or later . I work more hours than when I was at the bank , " Cothran confides . " At a job , you always have someone who rates what you 're doing . On your own , only your customers rate you . I 've learned by trial and error . " COMBINING WORK AND FAMILY Having a business in the home means that everybody gets involved in one way or another . Cothran 's mother , Pennie Loftis , works closely with Maids &; Meals . " For large functions , we use her kitchen , about a mile away . She has lots of counter space and a good-size stove . As a part-time employee , my mom helps cook , set up and shop . My husband , Jeffrey , is our official taste tester ; he evaluates each new dish . " GETTING THE WORD OUT In an effort to make Maids &; Meals self-sustaining , Cothran devotes about 40 percent of her time to marketing , advertising and promotion . Says the caterer of her monthly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's my biggest promotional cost . People wo n't spend money if they 've never heard of you . " DOLORES RATCLIFFE CONSULTANT When Dolores Ratcliffe applied to become a MasterCard merchant , the fact that she planned to work from home made bankers nervous . " I wrote to the bank president telling him I 'd received a letter congratulating me on being a loyal customer . I attached a copy and wrote , " You should know that in starting a home-based business I intend to maintain the same high level of integrity . ' In three days , I had my MasterCard-vendor arrangement , " Ratcliffe recalls . FROM EMPLOYED TO SELF-EMPLOYED Ratcliffe 's business is Corita Communications , Inc. , a market-research , training and consulting firm that also publishes books and newsletters . To start her business , based near Santa Monica , California , she drew on her experience managing 300 people as administrator of curriculum and training for a California school district , where she trained educators in time management , career development , team building and multicultural education . " In 1979 I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clients through my company , " says Ratcliffe . MAINTAINING A MARRIAGE To keep overhead down , Ratcliffe set up her office in a spare bedroom of the home she shares with her husband of 23 year Dr. Rick Ratcliffe , dean of the School of Engineering and Computer Science at California State University , Northridge . " I 'm more organized than I 'd be if I were n't married , " she says . " I keep the business as restricted to my office as possible . Because I 'm often involved in my work on the weekend , we make every Friday night Date Night . " Ratcliffe is adept at mentally dividing her private and professional roles . " You have a routine , just as if you went out to work . You prepare yourself for a workday . I 'm not walking around in a robe and curlers all day , " she says with a laugh . Her business attire at home is usually " dressy sport : casual but presentable , like a skirt and blouse and hose . " As an entrepreneur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where Is My Next Check Coming From ? ' When you cease to worry , you 're in trouble . To succeed you must always plan , anticipate , look toward new clients . " Although Ratcliffe wo n't say exactly how her company is doing in this recession , she admits that Corita Communications allows her to maintain a standard of living equal to when she was , she says dryly , " employed . " BUILDING A BUSINESS NETWORK A strong believer in networking , Ratcliffe joined several business groups , becoming an active committee member or officer in all of them . She is currently president and founder of the Association of Black Women Entrepreneurs . " Higher visibility is good for you  --  and for your business , " she maintains . Her work through her local chamber of commerce earned her a position on the board of the Los Angeles Private Industry Council , where she served four years . " Working on community-service projects together put me on a first-name basis with business leaders . I never pushed my company , but ultimately I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you call build credibility for yourself and your company . No one cares if you are home-based ; they just see your talents and contribution .
