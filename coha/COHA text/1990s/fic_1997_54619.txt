" SHE 'LL GO AFTER JAKE , MOM . " <p> " Just like she did the last one . " <p> Ariel 's older-than-thinkable daughters were whining their complaints against their aunt , her sister , due to arrive at high noon at the not-really-nearby San Antonio airport . <p> " Now now , hush hush , " she said in reflex , not exactly listening to the litany of her sister 's predatory habits . The forefront of her mind was fretting on another track , wondering if she and Lenore had ever been such an inseparable Abbott-and-Costello team as her daughters . ( Or Costello and Costello-was n't he the fat one ? ) Indigent girls , verging on thirty , who shared one bedroom , one tiled pink bath , and one part-time aromatherapy job between them . Now and then Ariel allowed herself to wonder , idly , if her girls were secretly married . To each other . To her ? <p> Now now , shame shame , she scolded herself . She knew they were only fortifying themselves against the longish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captivating whatever not-yet-moribund and attentive man Ariel had managed to acquire since the last visit . <p> Most of what Abigail and Alexandra were saying over the late morning 's stack of banana pancakes dripping in genuine maple syrup ( courtesy of the last beau , who still sent a Christmas gift from the frozen North ) was true . Lenore was a man-stealer , and out where she lived in El Paso del Norte there were n't many to be had , and those there were she 'd polished off and left behind like pecan husks . Or so she claimed . Ariel had read an AP feature on some hunter in the East who 'd doused himself with doe-in-heat scent and got stabbed in the chest by an eight-point rack of antlers . That might be her sister 's secret : doe-in-heat cologne . <p> What drove Ariel nuts was not the poaching , or not only , but her sister 's harping on the difference in their ages . Treating Ariel like she was just a week away from the old folks ' home-as if movie stars of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the baby boomers were not following close behind at her high heels . This year , for example , for Ariel 's birthday , the awesome Double Nickel , her sister had shipped a gaggle of books : diet for the elderly , arthritis , depression , Alzheimer 's , deep colonics , Parkinson 's , and one ( on incontinence ) called Staying Dry . <p> Ariel sighed and sipped her lukewarm coffee . She 'd spent the past year perfecting her Ida Lupino look : trim , tight-waisted little suits ; short , curly hair ; dark glances ; an air of intrigue . The package had got her a semi-steady named Jake , the first man ever in her single life not employed in higher education . A man who thought Academe was a Greek restaurant in Dallas . <p> He was a hydrologist , which meant he worried over water . He 'd spent years recording the damage of ten-pound aquatic rodents called nutria , who had relentlessly gnawed through the Louisiana marshlands already weakened by drilling and had moved onto the levees that kept the Mississippi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the animal rights people would n't let these river rats , big as tomcats , be shot or poisoned . He 'd moved gratefully to Texas  --  a dry state , and one destined to remain that way-where he calculated drought , depletion , subsidence , and vanishing groundwater . <p> She had never dealt before with a man who saw the practical , economic side of things ; her flings to date with scientists had been limited to theoretical , not to say ethereal , esoteric topics . Being market-savvy went along , apparently , with a balanced checkbook , matching socks , current vehicle inspection stickers , and an appreciation of her mail-order black Ida Lupino underwear . <p> Plus he fastened onto her work as an arachnologist . He delved eagerly into the commercial potential of spider silk , which they were now trying to duplicate in the lab in hopes that the synthetic version might be used as a wound covering . The charts and graphs he showed her pertained to dollars ; he had no interest in the science , no interest in the difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Industry could use you , " he liked to say , unbuttoning the tiny black buttons on her smartly fitted suit . <p> So Jake was a find , one she 'd even permitted her daughters to share a recent pancake breakfast with-a first . Now , no doubt , that was a thing of the past . Ariel sneezed and wiped her eyes . The exodus of men  --  of which , in truth , her lamebrained , flat-walleted husband was the second , not the first ( if you counted her dad ) - always got to her sinuses . <p> It was n't fair . Ariel was stuck with the lumpenproletariat , as she called her girls in the secret recesses of her mind , and her freeloading scumbag of an ex was always lurking in the background , bringing around his prepubescent girlfriends , wanting to take Ab and A1 to see PG movies as if they were still the same age as when she 'd booted him out . Lenore had no husband , past or present , no scions , not even a snarling dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to frequently fly into the vicinity of their faux-German farmhouse nestled in the scrub cedar , and to turn on the charm . <p> " Come on , young persons , " Ariel addressed her pair , not having come up with a satisfactory name for adult Kinder , progeny , offspring , bodily descendants . Could litter be used for only two ? Brood ? Herd ? Surely there was a permissible neutral term for a pair of overweight females one had , in a fit of temper and distress , left fatherless ? " It 's time to head for the airport . " <p> " Welcome , welcome , do n't you look tanned . You give yourself a South Seas cruise ? " <p> " Oh , for pity 's sake , Ariel , do n't be cheerful . It does n't become you , at your age . What 's this- ? " Her sister held her at arm 's length , taking in her suit . " Bette Davis , am I right ? " <p> " That was last year , " Ariel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were free to hear . Last year , in her Bette Davis phase , she 'd had a spider-slim waist that the maple-syrup man could all but span with two hands . But that had been at best a dark victory , and she 'd put it behind her . <p> " Ida Lupino ? " <p> " Is this all you have ? A garment bag ? " <p> " I do n't need a lot of clothes to sit out in the Hill Country with the ticks and look at the dry creekbed . I brought five female-sleuth paperbacks to pass the time . " Lenore looked around . " Anybody with you ? " <p> " Ab and Al are in the car . " <p> " No cowpoke ? " Her sister gave the word a suggestive meaning . Ariel did n't bother to answer . <p> Lenore must have had a facelift , or at least an eye-tuck . Or maybe just living alone and not being responsible for the ensnared soft inner feelings of next of kin gave your skin a glow . Not sharing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ padding up the stairs . Or maybe her sister was flat-out prettier in the way of semi-blondes with nice smooth shoulders and cheekbones that did n't dry up under layers of blusher . " How about you ? " she asked , to be civil . <p> " How about me what ? " <p> " Anybody in your life ? " <p> " Counting you ? " <p> Ariel sucked in her breath and hefted the bulky bag . It took her about two minutes with Lovely Lenore to wish she 'd changed her name , moved , left no forwarding address , had at least had the moxie-what would Lupino have done ?  --  to tell her kid sister to button her lip . <p> They located the Buick behind an airport van ; her daughters sat still as statues in the backseat . " Sit up front , one of you , " she 'd urged , " so it 'll look like someone 's at the wheel , wo n't you . I do n't want them hauling off the car . " <p> " We do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are n't going to pretend , " A1 had echoed . <p> How on this green earth could you get to be pushing thirty in central Texas and not know how to drive a car ? It made her crazy to think about . She knew it was not a man 's job to teach his children the intricacies of automatic transmission and a V-6 engine , but nonetheless there were canyon-sized gaps in her girls ' knowledge that she knew , sure as sunrise , would n't have been there if a father , any old shiftless ag teacher of a father , had been in residence at the key time . It was much the same as with spiders , which had a brief developmental window in which to learn to line burrows or make snares or spin webs . And then the chance was forever lost . <p> " The Bobbsey Twins , " Lenore crowed , pulling open the passenger door . " Please speak in unison when I address you . " <p> Ariel slammed on the brakes of the now-rolling vehicle . " Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flight right back to El Paso . " She glowered at her sister , who sat casually with one long leg tucked up , about to light a cigarette . Kim Novak ? Ariel did not countenance anyone saying a word against the lumpen . What she said , as their mother , or thought , was her own beeswax-but anybody else ... that was not permissible . One reason she 'd been exceedingly cautious about dragging any one of the bevy of divorced academics with an arcane specialty and horny expectations into the country house was the vulnerability she felt concerning her young . Hearing such a man even exhale in a possibly uncomplimentary way would have been intolerable , would have split the sheets , as they said , right there on the spot . <p> " Woo-woo , mother hen . " Lenore laughed . " Did I pull your string . What about that , girls ? " <p> Abigail , slightly the elder ( although what was two years at their age ? ) , piped up with , " Mom 's not dating anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her seat . <p> " She 's given up men , " Alexandra , who had her dad 's reddish hair and dimples , chimed in . " So you 're out of luck , Aunt Len . " <p> Ariel looked fondly at her defenders slumped in the backseat , in matching flowered tent dresses , knock-off Laura Ashleys , that reached their ankles . <p> " Must be somebody special , " her sister said , licking her lips . " What 's his name ? " <p> " Jake , " Ariel said dryly , making kindly liars out of her two . <p> " I ca n't wait . " Lenore dug out an iced-peach lipstick and rubbed some in the center of her full lips with a fingertip . Definitely Kim Novak . <p> " Thanks for the Elderhostel reading list , " Ariel said when they were alone on the wide front porch , listening to the owls and the neighbors ' dogs . Across the empty creekbed an occasional wild turkey flew toward the departing streak of daylight . <p> " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound like Ma . " <p> " What sounds like our mother ? A reading list ? Or being able to say thank you ? " <p> " Elder hostile , get it ? " <p> Did they ever spend so much as one evening without their parents sneaking into the conversation ? Would that be true of the lumpen when they were thirty years down the road ? Mom and her professing professors ; Dad and his pimply bimbos ? Or would they even recall past times ? Ariel sighed . <p> " What 's with the girls circling camp about your new beau ? " <p> " Why did n't Mother ever go out with other men ? You were around after I left  --  " <p> " You were there first . Miss See-All , Know-All . " Lenore shook the ice in her scotch . <p> It was drink time , and the girls were off selling rose oil and lavender essence to vegetarians with thick socks , heavy plaits , and homeopathic tendencies . Having left , with some reluctance , their mom to their aunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musician , female , who lived nearby . <p> " I guess she did n't like sex . " Ariel had opened a beer , to be companionable . She had cold butterflies in her stomach concerning their later guest , but that was mixing metaphors . She had cold feet in the pit of her stomach ? Something like that . She 'd have liked to molt off the porch into the horizon with the turkeys . <p> " Dad would 've stayed , you must know that , if we 'd been boys . No man leaves boys behind . " <p> " Not so . " Ariel felt her anger rise . That was simply not so . It had nothing to do with them , with her and her sister . It had everything to do with the fact that their dad was something of a louse and a gambler of the oil-well variety and their mother was caught tight as an insect in the web of her churchy upbringing . <p> " Says who ? What 's with this denial ? You think your old redhead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he 'd had boys to give BB guns to ? Not a chance . " <p> " I threw him out . " Ariel walked to the edge of the porch and looked across the ravine , past the cedars . Saying the litany to herself : I was a university professor ; he was a high-school ag teacher . He was envious . He was a shit . He could n't keep his zipper closed . He was just like my old man . <p> " Sure . " Lenore finished her drink in one swallow and dug in her jacket pocket for cigarettes . She 'd changed into tight blue jeans and a bright orange T-shirt that left not one thing to the imagination . Her lips were freshly peached , and two new layers of mascara coated her lashes . " Do n't think I do n't know what Dad said when I was born . Mom must have told me the story nine zillion times . Him hollering , ' Goddamn , woman , why 'd you wake me up for another girl ? ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words of her ex , in more or less the same vein , were tattooed on her brain : " Shit , another girl . Damn it , I thought I was gon na get myself a boy this time . " She did n't answer her sister . Girls . Daughters . Lumped together . Nobody used your name . The best you could aspire to was to share a job or a man between you . <p> Lenore perked up at the sound of the car turning into the long gravel drive . " I could do with a change of topic , " she said . <p> " Hi there , " Ariel said when Jake stepped up on the porch . " Join us . You know where the liquor is . This is my sister I told you about . I 'm going in and fix us some dinner . It 's a two-bean pot-roast stew . " Taking a lengthy look at his good , lined face , his salt-and-pepper hair and laugh creases like gullies , and his big strong arms and long bony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deep breath and let nature take its familiar course . <p> It was late when Ariel and her sister climbed the stairs to her room , fitted out with two double beds  --  a big , bare-floored room with plenty of space to cover all options . Abigail and Alexandra had already come home , scowled at their aunt , who was rocking on the porch swing with Jake , talking about the economic vicissitudes of running a travel agency . Ariel gave each girl a good-night peck in the kitchen , where she was washing up , with the window open , the night air and sound of low voices floating in . <p> Now Lenore wanted to fuss with her hair , then she wanted to borrow pajamas , because it had turned cool , compared to what you expected in February in this part of Texas . Then she decided to paint her toenails , sitting on the bed as if at a slumber party . She 'd taken off her makeup and scrubbed and creamed her face , which looked puffy and tired by the low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you find , " she said , with obvious sarcasm . <p> " He liked you , " Ariel told her , sitting cross-legged in her pj 's , twisting the ends of her hair . She wondered if they were going to be having slumber parties like this in their seventies , with her two across the hall become pudgy fifty-year-olds dreaming of coconut macaroons and banana pancakes . <p> " I 've never dealt with such a crude type in my life . " Lenore looked at her fingernails , shrugged . " Jeez . " <p> " Jake ? " <p> " I do n't want to ruin your romance , and I guess at your age maybe that 's the best you can do , but what a fruitcake . Truly . " Her sister lay back on the pillows and shut her eyes . " You would n't believe it if you 'd heard it . I was chatting along with him , flirting a little , the way I do , you know , keeping my hand in , and all of a sudden he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me out loud that he could tap the Morse code with his  --  thing-and did I want to see ? I nearly passed out it was so gross . " <p> Ariel felt something small and trembling take flight and soar in her chest . " Jake said that ? " <p> He and the girls were sitting around the kitchen table while Ariel served up strawberry shortcake . It was Sunday night , and they 'd all got back from putting her sister on the plane home . Ariel felt light as a feather : Ida Lupino , having routed the bad guys , rolls up her sleeves and gets back to work . <p> " Believe me , chickadees , I was scared out of my gourd , " Jake was explaining . " Your more had laid it right on the line to me : ' I 'm not going to marry you till you 've spent an evening with my sister . I want to be sure you 're vaccinated . ' Now I can tell you , I did n't have any idea what to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beat the band , falling against each other , bumping shoulders , falling apart and letting all their teeth show . Happy lumpen . The hydrologist had just maneuvered himself into the role of prospective daddy . <p> " She always tries to take Mom 's boyfriends away , " Ab said . <p> " Now now , hush hush , " Ariel responded in reflex , not really caring what they told him . <p> " So I was expecting a looker , since I know how a woman 's mind works , most of the time anyhow . And sure enough , she was a looker , your aunt , a **36;650;TOOLONG . So I thought to myself , How am I going to get out of this one ? It was just like sitting on the shore of the Old Mississippi , watching those river rats gnawing away the embankments until the whole levee fell into the floodwaters , and not being able to do a damn thing about it . Then I remembered that in those days one blast from my shotgun would have taken care of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked her straight in the eye , and I fired . " <p> " What did you say to Aunt Lenore ? " Al asked , wide-eyed . <p> " When you grow up and get boyfriends of your own , I 'll tell you then . " <p> " But we ca n't leave  --  " <p> " You better can . I 'm not marrying three women , just one . But let me give you a little advice . The way to get your dad 's attention is to make yourselves financially worthwhile to him . What does he do  --  ? " " He teaches ag at high school  --  " Ab answered . <p> " Use your heads . You got heads . The tomato has just been scientifically voted the cancer cure of the year . Why not offer to set up an experimental hydroponic tomato installation for him , and share the profits ? " <p> " Hydroponic ? " <p> " Look it up . " <p> They giggled again at such an idea , and when they 'd finished eating , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kiss in turn , and then Jake motioned to the girls to follow him outside . <p> " Where 're you going ? " Ariel asked , her chest still rattling with the feeling of wings . <p> " I 'm going to teach these sweet-smelling beauties the mysteries of the combustion engine , so they can drive off some sunrise into lives of their own .
