I just , you know , like I said before , puttin ' these people together . INTERVIEWER Yeah , yeah , yeah . You put them together . DAWSON It do n't take a college graduate to know you put these two groups together and you got trouble .

And this is one thing that I regret in my life , of course . There 's nothing I can do to change it though , nothing . Paul was standin ' there . And as we approached , Buck was drivin ' , I had the window down , and we were the lead truck . And our eyes met at the same time . And Paul went to wave , just when I was still movin ' , you know , real slow . I said : " You communist son of a bitch you ; you asked for the Ku Klux Klan , well here we are . " So . Then we kept goin ' . We got through okay  --  nobody knew yet , you know . There were three of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they got in front of the fourth car , more or less . Blocked them .

I 'll never forget this one cop  --  Gibson  --  who gave me the permit for November 3rd . There I was at the Greensboro Police Station , he was handing me the permit  --  which was also a guarantee of police protection , by the way  --  he looked me in the eye  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " So you gon na be armed ?

" No , but the permit states for you to be unarmed . " " Yeah , " I said , " we 'll be unarmed . Why ? Are you expecting trouble ? " " Nope . " The man said no . Just like that . Nope . When we were shot down on November 3rd , that scene flashed through my mind . I knew at that moment I knew we were set up . ( Lights up on Interviewer and Dawson . On screen : " At People .

( Scornfully ) You know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . ( Long pause ) So the people that were killed were the high-up people . p. 27 DAWSON Yeah , they were . And that 's been a good question : I mean , the question why did they pick out this , this and this to kill ? You 're right . I think I know where you 're goin ' . I 've been through this before . ( Laughs ) It 's a good question . But it was just one of them things . The Klan ai n't that intelligent , to plan something like that . They ca n't plan burning a cross , really . Now , I 'm not tellin ' you something I did n't say on the damn witness stand . I said : " They do n't have sense enough to come out of the damn rain .

You know she wouldna never got hit if she'da kept her damn dumb face in the doorway . Like , the street ran here , and she was up here , in the apartment , the houses , the development more or less . And she came out the alley there , and they just  --  bingo ! That 's how she got it . p. 28 INTERVIEWER How 'd you feel when suddenly everyone was getting  --  there were people being shot at ? DAWSON Well , we did n't find out  --  Buck and I left there , and we went over to a barroom . And I had a Coke , and he had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You did n't hear it ? You did n't hear anything ?

DAWSON Yeah , we heard the shots ; you could n't help it . It sounded like blasting . I said " Let 's get the hell out of here " to Buck . " Long Gone John . " INTERVIEWER So you took off as soon as they started to shoot at people . DAWSON Well , I do n't know . You use the word " at people . " I did n't see nobody point a gun at anybody . ( Lights up on Sally Bermanzohn . On screen : " And That 's When Mike Was Shot . " ) SALLY And finally there 's Mike.I was standing with Mike when the Klan and Nazi caravan drove up . We were talking about the first-aid car , that was his station wagon . He  --  Mike was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the middle of a poor black neighborhood.And so , he was gon na drive his station wagon right behind our march ; and there were first-aid supplies , in case somebody . fell , or twisted an ankle , or got tired , or . little things like that . We always had a first-aid car.And then this line of cars just drove very slowly , right in front of us , and I did n't know who they were . And then I saw the Confederate license plate tags ; and then I heard somebody yell out of the car : " You nigger ; you kike ; you nigger lover . " ( Pause ) And then  --  actually , it was a teenage girl yelling  --  and then there was a shot . And I saw this guy at the front of the caravan , with his body snaked out of the front window of the pickup truck , and a pistol that he had just shot in the air ; and I remember the smoke of the gun just kinda hanging in the air there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run back . And I was right there between two cars , and I just ducked down between two cars . And then I saw Mike , running back along the buildings . And I thought : Should I run back with him ? Maybe it 's safer to run back that way , away from this signal shot , this first shot . And I thought , well , I 'll stay right here . I think I 'm okay right here . And then suddenly there was a barrage of shots , and I thought it was from where that signal shot , that first shot was.But it was n't  --  it was from the back of the caravan . It was from the direction that people were running towards . So Mike , thinking he was running away from that first shot , was actually running towards the guys who had the long rifles , and who knew who they wanted to shoot  --  were aiming carefully at people . And apparently , Jim Waller was fighting with a Klansman . And Mike went up to help him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . ( Lights up on Lewis and Marty in his office .

MARTY The prosecutor , who was ostensibly our lawyer , said to us , his clients : " Most people in Greensboro believe you got what you deserved . " They then proceeded to impanel a jury hostile to us , picked with his approval . LEWIS See , North Carolina is an anti-union state , and Klan presence is strong . Most of those folks let on the jury were n't against the Klan . In fact , apparently during jury selection , one of them even said the Klan was like " the NAACP for white folks . " And communism !

But he was still let on the jury . LEWIS Well . Marty and Floris were held in contempt for refusing to participate . MARTY When the first trial opened , we already knew that we were not going to get any kind of justice  --  it was just gon na be aimed at us and not at the Klan and Nazis who had killed us  --  Floris Cauce and I stood up in that courtroom that first day and said : " This trial is a farce . This trial is a sham . The police killed our husbands . They let the Klan come in and kill our husbands . " Our mouths were taped . We were hauled out of court and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 30 LEWIS When the Klan and Nazis were acquitted by this all-white jury , progressive people were outraged . " Hey , we saw this on videotape , " they said , " what happened ? " MARTY This was when Lewis and his team came in . LEWIS Our side organized and tried to call for a federal investigation . MARTY This time we fully cooperated  --  LEWIS But it was what I like to call " the fox guarding the henhouse . " The indictment used a very narrow statute of the civil rights law . They made it so you had to prove racial animus  --  a racial motivation for the murders  --  so the defense used anticommunism again  --  " outside agitators and communists came down here and caused trouble , your honor . " MARTY You know  --  historically how racial violence has always been dodged in the South . LEWIS Again , an all-white jury acquitted the Klan and Nazis . MARTY The third trial , the civil trial in 1985 , was our last chance .

The Klan 'd go to the local police and say : " Hey , these integrationists are comin ' down here . We want to go in and bash some heads , " and the police 'd look at their watches and say : " Okay  --  we 'll give you twenty minutes .

Is this why we escaped from Germany ? So you could maybe get yourself killed here ? " But of course what happened to them was exactly why I was doing what I was doing . SALLY Yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little kid , I heard Holocaust stories from my mother about Jews being rounded up and people being killed in front of her eyes . And one of the more gruesome and memorable things was my mother seeing Nazi dogs , literally dogs , German shepherds , dragging bodies through the streets . And she was about seventeen when the war started , and her parents were taken . It 's just about the same age as my older daughter , which is really a kind of sobering and frightening thought . But she remembers these dogs dragging bodies through the street , and running after them to see if the bodies they were dragging were her parents . BIG GEORGE I grew up in South Carolina in the 1930s . I remember the Klan going into people 's houses , dragging them out , beating them , hanging them .

You ca n't do anything about it . Well . BIG GEORGE The grownups kept it hid from you . Something happened to such and such a one , he was dragged out in the middle of the night , and beat up or shot , and if you asked questions , they would say : " You do n't need to know about that .

I was in a parking lot at Duke . ( Looks to Paul ) p. 37 RONNIE I never really been a great follower of Dr. King . I appreciated what he was doing , but I never could get into all this passive resistance  --  somebody wants to kill you , you fall down on your knees and start praying for that bastard ? Me and Dr. King , our philosophy is so different . I was more into what Malcolm was saying . So I would read a lot of Malcolm to tune into him . ROSE Well , what really made me want to do something about the system was when they took Miss Cary , my friend who 's an old lady , to the hospital . She was real sick , and they rushed her to the hospital . But everyone at Duke Hospital was so busy , and they just overlooked her because she had no insurance . But then Paul told them at the emergency room that someone should see her , raising his voice , and looking mad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , she told me : " Paul really stood up for me . I would n't trade nothing for that college boy . " Miss Cary talked about that for years and years and years ! And this did something to me . And everything that Paul got into , I would get into . Workers ' Viewpoint and everything . BIG GEORGE I liked the people in WVO . Many were highly educated . I wondered , why would they jeopardize their careers to work in the mills ? I remember Black Beard . JANE Jim Waller . p. 38 BIG GEORGE Yeah , that 's what we called him . He was a doctor . He 'd say that he did n't want to just nurse the wound , but to cure the disease .

But when this whole debate came on about going communist , I felt like we was n't doing the right thing . BIG GEORGE We was still just working for the people . ROSE But once you said you were a communist , you just isolated yourself from everybody . It was so hard to convince people you stood for the same things you did when you were Workers ' Viewpoint . A lot of people said : " Could n't you just not say that word ? " BIG GEORGE Uh-huh . ROSE We changed our name to Communist Workers Party just two weeks before the massacre . ( She shakes her head ) People never understand the word " communist .

They tried to laugh it off , you know how politicians can do . We never did know what communism was . When the movement started studying Marxism , and I heard the word communism again , I said : " Well , Lord , I 'm gon na find out what communism is .

Every black church knew us and we knew every black minister in the county . p. 40 BIG GEORGE We were trying to educate people on the Klan .

When the Klan came , it was like the whole world had fell.And afterwards , I went into a shell myself . I was scared . I still had this rebel feeling , I wanted to go out there and say : " You ca n't do this to people . " I still want to do the things I did before , but there 's a lot of fear , knowing that someone out there does n't want you to have your rights or to be happy . I was eight years old that day .

I can see the picture in my mind of her taking me to this hall closet in our house and pulling out this Klan robe . My father was in the Klan . I remember being shocked . I do n't remember having the sensibility to be offended . I just was shocked . There was a point where I realized what he was doing was very racist , but he was very loving , and would bring people home off the street , hitchhikers  --  everybody , black or white . He was one of those curious Southern paradoxes , because he was a kind person one-on-one to either black people or white people . He would give you the shirt off his back . He drove my mother crazy . But in group process , he projected his unhappiness on black people , the logical people you did that to in the 1940s or 1950s , as a Southern man  --  a Southern white man.My mother was one of these typical Southern religious women , very quiet .

The people in Greensboro are intent on smashing and driving out the scum Ku Klux Klan and their secret supporters . The march will be more powerful than ever . We fully expect the police to continue their slimy tactics . They will do anything to disrupt this march and disguise themselves . They might harass us or send provocateurs into our ranks to try to disrupt the march.What we want to do is say the Klan 's nothing but a bunch of cowards . They 're not going to come here .

" " I Have a Dream . " He 's on the phone . He speaks beautifully , quietly , rationally  --  articulate and charming . He looks like an Ivy Leaguer. ) p. 47 DUKE Yes . I ran for Governor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent of the votes.I think my ideas show the Republican Party the way.The average working man in this country isconservativeof philosophy , of values ; in terms of unions , they might have a liberal point of view . that 's the only place they have a liberal ( Laughs ) point of view.Taxes , welfare , affirmative action , all the issues  --  thehard hats in this country are natural troopsof the Republican Party.I have n't been in the Klan for years . And I 'm not associated with the National Association for the Advancement of White People , the NAAWP , that organization anymore , but I would n't be ashamed of that fact.I think if there 's an NAACP then NAAWP is perfectlyappropriate.I am proud of my heritage.We . we . the cultural , religious , racial . heritageof the country is being split apart now.And uh even if we have not always been of one raceor onefaith uh . the Europeans , Christian , value system . Western European value system has been the bedrock of the country.And if that erodes , I think that the foundations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mind.No one 's undergone the kind of smear campaign Idid . They 'll accuse anybody of being a fascist or a racist or a Naziif you talk about these kinda things . I left the Klan because I got sick of fighting thatstereotype.I wanted to uh discuss the issues confronting myheritagewithout being accused of violence or hate.I started NAAWP when I got sick of being labeledwith that moniker.This thing is not about hating others but loving yourown.I think the people of the world are turningconservative and I think the European-Americansand European-Europeans for that matterare starting to realize like every culture and everyheritage they have a right to preserve what 's theirsand their way of life.We 're people that look at conservatism in more of ahistorical way , much like Patrick Buchanan has adopted.I think Patrick Buchanan got some of his ideas forpolitical activism from what he saw in my election.He feels he has to disassociate himself from anything I might sayand he did in the presidential primaries and that 's his right . If it helps him politically , I do n't have any problem with it.Segregation comes about through people 's choices.Schools have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not fight that trendbut we should facilitate it. I mean there 's a real cultural clash that takes placewith integration.black kids even listen to different kind of music thanwhite kids do.They dress differently.They have different languages , different lifestyles , different uh values.I was just in D.C. a while back , Department of LaborcafeteriaEight hundred maybe a thousand people in the cafeteriaEight hundred whites , maybe two hundred blacksTwo hundred blacks sitting all together eating lunchEight hundred whites sitting together eating lunchthat 's one of the more liberal departments right inour federal government ! So you know  --  give people a choice ! So , no , I do n't think segregation has to be legislated.See  --  that 's quite different from what happened in1954.Segregation by law.You give people freedom of choice in the matter , it will take place naturallyand the racial harmony will be much greater.One reason why you have phenomena like theskinheadsand a lot of the white kids that that uhare very radical on this issueis because of forced integration.Because they 've endured it , they 've endured uhviolence and uh put downs and uh racial slursand by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come out with not so much racial self-respect and awareness , but they come out with uh sometimes a burning racial hatred toward minorities.And that 's what integration 's produced.It has n't produced love and harmony , it 's produced more racial antagonism than ever . ( Slowly a slide of a map from a newspaper published by Duke fades up . The map sections off America into racial zones . For instance , Long Island is New Israel ; Florida , New Africa , etC . ) No , no , that map was really a joke.This was not a serious thingabout how to solve the problem in America.Y'know every piece in every magazine is not endorsed by the editors . That 's one of the typical political tricks used against me.Anything can be distorted and taken out of context.I never advocated any forced removals , repatriation of blacks to Africaor forcible partitioning of America.The most I 've ever said on that is what I just told youthose who want separation , blacks that wantseparation , give it to ' em ! Those that want it , let ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sharpton , Jesse Jackson . ( Laughs ) I have a dream for America  --  that America will someday be again a nationthat respects and reveres its magnificent , European , Western heritageat the same time tolerates or is tolerant of diversity.A nation based on excellence in all areas of liferather than mediocritya nation that believes in equal opportunitybased solely on ability and talent and industriousness.A nation that each generation removesa little more of its underclass . a country based on merit , a true meritocracy . p. 48 INTERVIEWER ( On speaker phone ) . Mr. Duke , you sound almost like a progressive . What separates your dream from the dream of , say , Martin Luther King ? DUKE Martin Luther King 's dream was a fraud.The " I Have a Dream " speech was a fraud . That 's pretty tough , okay ? Because I do n't think it was ever the intention of the civil rights movement from the early daysto have equal rights ; it was always special rightsaffirmative action went right with itThe " I Have a Dream " speech was written by aMarxistwhich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a communist.I 'm sorry I ca n't remember his name , but it 's common knowledge . The media in this country  --  so many of ' em  --  Marxiststhat 's how our schools learned about the antebellumSouthand reconstruction . But ostensibly , that idea of Martin Luther King ofequal rightsI can agree with.And one more thing I can agree with  --  and this 'll shock you  --  he said in his " I Have a Dream " speech he said : " Someday we could have a world where we havewhite childrenhand in hand with black kids , and red kids , andyellow kids . " He says that " I have a dream that that will someday be possible . " And let me tell you something.I can share in a way in that dream of Martin LutherKing uh and if the present trend continueswith immigration and differential birth ratesand the rising numbers of the underclassif those things continuethat dream will be impossiblebecause there wo n't be any more white kidsfor the black and red and yellow kids to hold hands with.That 's a different way to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a racist.I 'll be honest . I want to preserve my heritage.I love the traditions of Shakespeare and Milton andNietzsche and Hegel and uh the great musicsay Mozart ( He pronounces it " Mo-zart " ) or Handel or Beethoven or for that mattersome of the modern writers we still have todaywhich are European in outlookand uh I love our traditions and our value systemand I think genocide is the worst crime.I ca n't think of a worse crimethan the purposeful eradication from this earth of a people.I am a very strong naturalist  --  I believe in theenvironmentand the preservation of all kind of life on earthhuman life or animal life  --  or for that matter flora.But for me there is no greater crime . Genocide really means the destruction of the genes.And if we are destroyed whether it be by gas chamberwhich is probably not on the horizonor whether it simply be by the fact we do n't have any kids  --  you understand ? It would be a great tragedy.The real minority on the planet right now is Caucasian mankind.Europeans built this countryare responsible for the Declaration of Independenceand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we will lose America.Now a lot of peoplethink thatand will say thatbehind closed doors.I just speak out . ( On screen : " A Skinhead . " " W.A.R . " Lights come up on a young man , very thin , almost waiflike . He is hunched over , vulnerable. ) p. 49 SKINHEAD It starts early . They start to drain your white pride in school.We are the master race  --  intellectually , creativity  --  we are the master race .  --  How did we come enslaved by the Jews ? I think the answer is easy  --  it 's in our culture , it 's in our heritage , it 's in our blood from day one to be honest , honorable , hard-working people . It 's in their blood from day one to learn how to deceit the Gentiles.You know a Jew is not a white man . Y'ever heard the expression " blood in the face " ? Well , lemme ask you , can a Jew blush ? Listen , he 's just a nigger in disguise.And now what do we have ? A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law which might as well be called the anti-white law cuz I never heard it used against any of those mud races.There are a lot of angry white people out here now . We have to prepare for war , and we know that . The time has come  --  it 's going to be too late . That means food storage , target practice , ammunition . There 's going to be a lot of bloodshed . Personally , I ca n't think of a better way to go than to die for my people . ( He raises his arm in a Heil Hitler salute ) White Power ! ( On screen : " The Inner Circle . " ) DAWSON And why , people ask me , why 'd ya join the Klan . I joined the Klan for experiments . I was always curious about their activities . And how that came about . Right down here in the restaurant , I was sitting there , and this fellow sitting next to me just started to talk . About enigration , and stuff like that , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says : " You 'd make a good Klan member . " So he says : " Why do n't you fill this application out ? " and hands me an application . p. 50 INTERVIEWER For the Klan ? DAWSON For the Klan . INTERVIEWER A written application . DAWSON Right . He was the Exalted Cyclops . ( Laughs ) He was the president . INTERVIEWER That 's his name ? Exalted Cyclops . DAWSON Exalted Cyclops . That 's the wise man . Okay ? So , that 's what he was . I found out later . But Buck and I got together right away . You know , he was from Wisconsin , and they used to call us the Yankees . I 'm from Jersey . Never by name ; it was always the Yankees . So . I ended up Titan . ( He stresses the second syllable ) INTERVIEWER Titan ? How do you spell that ? DAWSON Titan ? I do n't know . I 'm a sixth-grade dropout . INTERVIEWER T-I-T-A-N . DAWSON T-I-T-I-A-N . I think . Yeah . See @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's in charge of the state . And each city has maybe three or four meeting halls . They 're called Klavern Halls , and they 're meeting halls . And I was in charge of them all in this Greensboro area here.And my biggest downfall was , I guess , I got in with the Echelon immediately , the higher-ups . The Grand Dragon , George Foster , with people like that . And I was with the Echelon . I was curious . p. 51 INTERVIEWER Curious . DAWSON Curious . Because of the blacks . I do n't uphold blacks . I just ca n't help it ; that 's the way I am . INTERVIEWER You do n't uphold  --  you mean you hate ' em . You do n't like ' em . DAWSON You 're using the word hate . That 's a strong word . INTERVIEWER Is it accurate ? DAWSON " You do n't bother me , I do n't bother you . " I 'm not doin ' it to deliberately go out of my way to harm a black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd go off the deep end quicker for a black to do something small to me.To actually boil down , when I first went to Klan meetings , you know , I guess I was like a lot of people . You expect to see a black hanging in the corner there . Or one hanging over there , or something like that . INTERVIEWER Hanging ? DAWSON That 's exaggeratin ' now . But , you know , the meetings , like I said , are just meetings . That 's all . It 's like they 're Moose meetings . And what they did at the rally and the next rally and so on . But after the meetings are over , you meet in the car , the back of a car , and that 's called the Inner Circle . And that 's where the  --  out of the meeting hall , there might be two , three hundred people in the Klan Klavern Hall , but there 's only about six , eight or ten that 's in the Inner Circle , and the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 52 INTERVIEWER So that 's when it gets interesting right ? When you 're in the Inner Circle . DAWSON You 're the only one who knows about it  --  the grand jury , nobody would tell ' em what the Inner Circle was . That was kept quiet . Stop bitin ' your nails . You nervous ? INTERVIEWER Yeah , well , it 's a nervous-making day , you know ? DAWSON Well , you can bite ' em if you wish . ( Laughs ) INTERVIEWER You 're right , I was biting my nails . In the early seventies , you had a falling out with the Klan , did n't you ? DAWSON I 'll have a falling out with you before the day is out . ( Lights up on Marty Nathan . On screen : " Marty Nathan . " " This Abyss .

He came back , and everyone was saying how exciting it was , and how it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all with it . And after everybody left , Mike said : " I was scared to death . We almost got ourselves killed . " My response to that was : " What 's wrong with you , Mike ? Why do n't you have more spirit ? " That was a rift between us.Just a week before November 3 , I was sitting in Shoney 's  --  this restaurant we all went to  --  with Mike , and we had just gotten a copy of that letter to the Klan that had been made into a leaflet . Mike looked at it and said : " This is crazy . This is really off the wall . " I got angry at him . Why did n't I listen to him ? Because deep inside of me , it did n't make any sense to me either.That morning  --  November 3 , we got into a fight , and he said something about not wanting to go . I got mad at him . We had to take separate cars anyway , which we did . But then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were just waiting at the other starting point when Jim came over and told me to send a first-aid car for any accidents on the march and I asked Mike to go over to Morningside . That was the last I ever saw of him.Al came over and said some people had been shot . Joyce Johnson and I went over to Morningside . And that 's where I saw . ( Long pause ) You know what sticks in my mind ? I did n't actually hear it , it 's from the videotapes , it 's Signe 's screams after she saw Jim That sticks in my mind  --  this unbelief  --  this abyss . ( Lights up on Interviewer and Dawson . On screen : " You 're Not in It for the Money . " ) p. 53 DAWSON Yeah . I had a falling out with the United Klans , yeah . INTERVIEWER You were arrested in a shoot-out in Middletown between the Klan and some black people , were n't you , and the Klan did n't stand by you ? DAWSON Yeah . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for five years . Now , they always said if it was Klan activity , the Klan would stand in back of you . So I got rather upset . And they had an Imperial meeting there , and I called them a buncha damn thieves at the meeting , because they would n't pay : " You 're just a buncha damn thieves , that 's all you are . " I called ' em a buncha scum . Pay outta my own pocket . Then the FBI , after I made that statement , the FBI had informants to inform on the informants . So they brought me downtown here , and you know , well , they came over the house , and they want to talk to you.And he says : " You see that pack of papers there ? " " Yeah . " " That 's your background , and your buddy James Buck . If we go through this paper real real good , we 'll have enough to put your unh unh where it belongs . " I says : " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing , you go do it . " So . INTERVIEWER Was that from Klan activities ? DAWSON Ah , you do n't know . It was a stack of papers . They could have been all blank . You do n't know . You 're never sure . They said : " Now look ! What 's the difference ? You 're goin ' to these meetings , and you 're goin ' to the rallies ; you 'll go , and you 'll get paid to go ! " And finally I got thinking about it , andI said : " You get me off that probation for Middletown , and I 'll work for you for a year . " So what they did , they give ya twenty-five dollars for going to a local meetin ' , fifty dollars out of town , eight cents a mile travelin ' , eight dollars a hundred to Charlotte and eight dollars back . So that was your pay , ya know . What they paid you . No big deal . p. 54 INTERVIEWER No big deal , right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the money you know . People say , was ya in it for the money ? You 're not , ' cause there 's no money there . Now , do n't forget , we 're goin back in time too , you know . INTERVIEWER Oh , I know . DAWSON So it 's not bad . INTERVIEWER So what were the guidelines ? Did they just say they wanted information ? During the eight years you informed for the FBI , did n't they tell you what you could or could n't do ? DAWSON Absolutely not . They give you no guidelines to go on . None whatsoever . You 're on your own . ( On screen : " Lewis Pitts . " " It Ai n't Our Jurisdiction .

He was picked to come down here cuz he busted the most heads at a Jewish Defense Organization meeting in Ohio . ( Finds them . Throws down the pictures .

We now know Butkovich was actually teaching the Nazis how to make explosives and automatic weapons .

DAWSON I think they knew that I just did n't worry about nothin ' . James Buck and I were feared around here . We had a reputation . They needed anything done  --  cross-burning , intimidation  --  they called James Buck and Eddie Dawson to do the dirty work . My truck . I had it set up that you pushed a button and the back lights went out . If anything had to be done , they 'd call the extremist . You did n't scare me . I put up a good front .

I was never scared of the Klan  --  INTERVIEWER You were n't . Uh-huh . DAWSON Because I knew them . And I knew that they ran scared . Even when  --  the shooting . After that . I knew too much on the police department ; I knew too much about the FBI . And I was worried about them sending me away  --  I mean , forever . p. 56 INTERVIEWER You mean , killing you . DAWSON I got to a point where I used to put a pebble on the hood of my truck at night , and in the morning , I 'd look at that first  --  to make sure they did n't lift the hood up , ya know . You 're damn right . INTERVIEWER You thought the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that what you 're saying ? DAWSON Yeah . They get rid of you and think nothing of it . Hell yeah . You see , what did n't help much any : Len Bogaty  --  FBI  --  turned against me . So Bogaty makes this statement to me , that after the trials are over , after things settle down , he 'll give me more information on what happened . Okay ? So maybe two months after the trials are over , and everything is settled down , I was over his house  --  now I got this on tape . I says , " Hey , we 're alone here . What happened during that mess , you know ? What 's the bottom line on this ? " He says : " Whaddaya mean ?

See , I could always understand the Klan 's point of view . They have always identified who they hate . They have always admitted they 're violent people . I suppose I 'm most angry at the police . In my eyes , they were on trial more than the Klan . And I 'm angry at us for letting it happen . Even though we did n't mean to . But we were fighting armed men with ideas , with words.I do n't know . I guess , Greensboro was a place where I lost my purpose in life . I still do n't go to demonstrations .

They were night riders , they were covered , they were in sheets , and nobody knew exactly who they were , and they could do just anything they wanted.And during the civil rights movement the Klan backed off . But then , in the seventies , in the mid-seventies as the movement died down , the Klan started stirring again . And in 1979 , it was on a real resurgence . There were all kinds of Klan public meetings , and open recruitment drives by the Klan . And it was in this context that we had done our own anti-Klan campaign . And our slogan , " Death to the Klan , " we did n't  --  it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any Klansman , but to say to the Klan : " We are not afraid of you . We are not . We are black , and white , and we are united and we will not be scared into fearing you . You will not prevent us from building unions , and from people working together on all the issues that concern them . " And so , the rally was supposed to be militant , it was supposed to be bold ; and it was supposed to just try to break that aura of invincibility that the Klan had.But the Klan used our words as an excuse to open fire and kill us . And clearly , in retrospect , our slogan was a big mistake . But I think it 's really important to see that we made mistakes . We made mistakes . We did not commit crimes . The Klan and Nazis committed crimes . They murdered five people . And did they ever pay for their mistakes ? They never served a day in jail . Not one day . No one ever served time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and this society let them walk free.And I feel that letting the Klan get away with what they did to us , as well as what they 've done to hundreds of thousands of other people in this country in their bloody history is part of the reason that we have a big problem on our hands today . Because they think they can get away with it . And people turn a blind eye in this country . It 's like they see other countries as having big problems with terrorists . The Klan is a terrorist organization . That has been their sole purpose for over a hundred years in this country . That 's what they do , they terrorize people . And yet there 's been a reluctance to face that fact , or to come down on them , or to make them pay for their crime ! Even when we know , even when we have it on TV who did the shooting ! When I heard about the Oklahoma bombing , I was horrified , along with the rest of the country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to a daycare center like that one , and I taught in public daycare for several years , and it just  --  well , it was terrible.When the news came out , that it was American rightwingers who had done this attack , I was frankly not surprised .

I remember six , seven years old , me and my sisters looking in at those A&amp;T students  --  standing outside Woolworth 's , looking through the windows . The first sit-ins .

But when you stuck together there was some victories that you could see , that people can still see today . But ai n't nobody doing anything.What my friends died for , should be going on full force today . They really believed in what they were doing , and they put all their heart and soul in it . I know somewhere , they know what 's going on . And one day they gon na walk back and touch all them souls and they going to get on back out there , and let us know we was wrong for stopping .

JOHNSON Let me tell you what it 's not , because many people have tried to present me as some kind of Paul , the biblical figure Paul ? , who was possessed by evil thoughts , who had some gifts but who was hit by a bolt of light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? And the Lord spoke to him and that was his moment of conversion ? Are you kind of familiar with that biblical story ? ( Interviewer nods ; she halfway knows it . Nelson laughs . ) Okay . Now , the problem with that , when it comes to me , is that it first establishes my prior life as hurtful and hateful and mean ; and I 'm not even sure that 's accurate with Paul , but it 's there in the record . The reason I drifted away from the church was mainly because I thought that the church needed to be doing more of what I was doing , okay ? ( Laughs ) And it was n't , and I met people who had , you know , sources of analysis , things that they studied , got me into Marxism , that was very helpful , and to this very day , there 's much value in that study . I think I 've learned to critique it better , in terms of my own understanding , things that I think are very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the early eighties , I really was so rejected around here , that  --  I think I shared with you  --  once I went to a job , and the guy went to call the police ; I sat in the courtroom , everyone got up and moved to the other side of the court . I listened to radio talk shows when people said they wished I had been shot , and all this kind of stuff . And my children had to listen to it . I started to reflect , think , actually talk to a lot of people , and I really was taken back to the faith of my youth . p. 69 INTERVIEWER Tell me about that . JOHNSON Well , where I grew up , my grandfather founded a church ; my father was a deacon in it , my mother played piano , and I believed it . But I did n't think other people did . That was why I moved away from it . And actually , the mistake that I made was to draw too close a relationship between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Divine . And I would advise anyone : never get those two mixed up . INTERVIEWER Right . JOHNSON But one connection to my political past , I think , is I think that the people who say they are atheists and express that , and show a lot of love and good work , are probably closer to whatever the Divine is . I saw that with some . ( Laughs ) it 's not an empty thought . INTERVIEWER ( Laughs ) Yes , I understand . JOHNSON They have kind of decided not to drag along behind a lot of symbols and empty talk and it 's almost a confession , that : " Here I am , and that 's all I am . I do the best that I can .

And if you examine the scripture a little bit , it says that if there is no persecution , no standing up , no struggling for righteousness , then there is no progress towards the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love of people destroys suffering , by suffering with and on behalf of those who suffer.It 's a close identity to people , and the identity is so deep , that the Person who was going and teaching says : " When you do it to them , you 're doing it to me . If you hate the poor , then you hate me , because you 'll always find me shoulder to shoulder with them . If you kill them , then you 're gon na kill me first , because I 'm standing at the front of the line . " He said some words like these : " Blessed are the poor , blessed are the weak , blessed are those who hunger , blessed are those who mourn . " If you examine it closely , with the finest magnifying glass , you will not find him saying : " Blessed are the rich and the famous . " Jesus also said : " I want you to understand that even though you 're going to suffer , it 's not going to be in vain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up for righteousness , when you stand up , you take part in creating a whole new reality . " I want you to see it and feel it : a reality in which everybody 's somebody . A reality in which there is no need for racism , because we 're all somebody equal to each other . A reality in which there are no Nazis , there are no Klan , there is no shooting , because somebody suffered for righteousness ' sake . Jesus said that if you stand up for righteousness , you will be persecuted.And then there 's an interesting thing in the scripture . It says that when you do that , do n't hang your head down . And this is almost unbelievable : it says do n't hang your head down when people talk about ya , and call you ugly names , and drag your name through the mud and say all kinds of evil things about you . It says : " Stand up and jump for joy because you know you 're onto the right thing . " I read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is something to be said for believing in the future and forgiveness . But you see , my faith has not always been deep enough to keep on believing in the absence of evidence.You see , if I can make this a little more concrete , sometimes when your closest friends are killed , and you see their names drug through the mud , treated as nothing , you start to ask the question : what did it all mean ? When you look in the faces of people that you have come to know and love , and see the pain in those faces because a spouse has been snatched from life together , and the very persons themselves have been placed in a jail , you start to ask yourself : what does it all mean ? You start to ask : what does it mean when you see yourself accused of trying to get your own children killed in order to get some publicity , so that your own narrow ends might be served ? What does it mean when folk that you love ca n't get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does it mean when you find yourself beaten in the back of a judge 's chamber , with your head bleeding , and taken to jail ? What does it mean when there 's so much suffering and persecution ? p. 71 I want to conclude this message by saying that dying is not the worst thing in the world , but perhaps living for nothing , and then dying . We 're all gon na die  --  why do n't we stand for something while we 're living ? And if we look at suffering , if we suffer for righteousness ' sake , there 's a beautiful thing on the other side of suffering . King said that the arc of the moral universe is long , but it bends toward justice . Somebody said that truth , crushed to the earth , will rise again ; Greensboro yet will have to bear witness to the truth of its own history , because the truth of the love of those , by whatever names they were called , has been crushed to the ground but I believe it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's speech . ) Suffering does n't last always . There is a psalm which says that you might suffer for a long time , that you might carry pain for a long time , that you might hurt for a long time , that you might be confused for a long time , they said that trouble might endure for a night , but thanks be to God , the joy still comes in the morning . On the other side of suffering , there is joy . On the other side of pain , there is joy . On the other side of hardship , there is joy ! And this is the pretty part : it says that if you just keep on walking , if you do n't give up , if you just stay on the course , if you come back year after year and keep on fussin ' anyhow , that the glory of God will be revealed ; all of us will see it together , and we will be brothers and sisters in a new community on the other side .
