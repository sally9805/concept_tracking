Who would have thought that the Clinton administration would fail to enforce our environmental laws ? <p> WHEN NEWT GINGRICH AND HIS fellow Republicans forced a temporary government shutdown in late 1995 , Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Carol Browner scored points for the president by warning that " the environmental cop is not on the beat . " Her warning worked . The image of government standing idly by while corporate polluters fouled the air and water was an effective scare tactic , and it was credited with helping to ward off deeper cuts in environmental spending . <p> Yet Browner 's image was a little disingenuous , even at the time . As House Commerce Committee Chairman Tom Bliley observed less than a year later , the environmental cops appeared to have been " at the donut shop all along . " In a press release , Bliley noted that " inspections of toxic waste sites are down , administrative actions against polluters are down , civil penalties are down , and so are criminal penalties . " <p> Since then the environmental cops have strayed even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  or anywhere else , for that matter  --  seems to care . Promoting a new philosophy of " compliance assistance , " state and federal regulators now focus more on educating polluters than inspecting them or punishing them when they break the law . The result has been a precipitous nationwide drop in enforcement activity . Over the past five years inspections , referrals for civil or criminal prosecution , and sanctions  --  including fines  --  have dropped in almost every state . In some cases the drop has been more than fifty percent , and hazardous waste inspections have declined more than any other category . Although many of the worst offenses have occurred at the state level , the EPA has been remarkably lax in its oversight role . " Browner has massively disinvested in enforcement , " says one former high-level EPA official . <p> Environmental officials are quick to respond that measuring inspections and fines does n't tell you whether the air or water is getting any cleaner . After all , if everyone were to comply with the law , enforcement activity would drop to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not what has been happening . It 's true that we 've made some enormous strides in protecting the environment over the past 30 years . Catalytic converters have made cars far cleaner than they used to be , and removing the lead from gasoline has made all of us breathe easier . Many nearly extinct species have recovered , and forests have returned to barren areas throughout the country . <p> But these gains could be reversed if we do n't do a better job of enforcing the law . Ground-level ozone , which causes a range of respiratory ailments , remains a serious health risk in most American cities , and in some areas it 's getting worse . Many of the industrial sources that create the bulk of ozone-forming polllution are in violation of the law . According to a recently-released study of EPA records by the Environmental Working Group , almost 40 percent of major U.S. auto assembly , iron and steel , petroleum refining , pulp manufacturing , and metal smelting and refining industries were " significant violators " of the Clean Air Act between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them have been fined , and the fines were almost always too small to have any deterrent effect . According to the report , EPA oversight of state enforcement is " virtually nonexistent . " <p> Or consider water . In early September over 1,000 people drank contaminated water at a county fair in upstate New York . Two died and 65 others were hospitalized . If you think this could n't happen to you , think again . A recent federal audit found that nearly 90 percent of all violations of the Safe Drinking Water Act go unreported . Some of those violations are harmless data-entry errors , but they also include potentially lethal problems such as contamination with pesticides and fecal coliform bacteria . <p> Meanwhile , 40 percent of U.S. waters are unsafe for fishing and swimming . Why ? EPA studies have found that 40 to 50 percent of major water pollution sources are in significant non-compliance with the Clean Water Act . The true figure could be far worse , because , according to a report written by current and former environmental officials and published by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stunningly poor job of monitoring water quality . The report concludes that the states are " free to manipulate numbers in order to falsely portray continuing progress in water quality when , in fact , what fragmentary reliable information exists often suggests the exact opposite . " <p> Or consider what has happened to the coal mining industry during the Clinton-Gore years . Strip mining operations frequently contaminate drinking water , destroy topsoil and forests , poison workers , and damage houses . That 's why they 're governed by one of the strictest environmental laws on the books . Lately , however , that law has n't meant much . In West Virginia , the second-largest coal-producing state , federal and state regulators made 470 inspections of mines in 1993 , and found 514 violations . In 1998 they made 92 inspections , and found 67 violations . " These coal companies did n't just get religion after 1993 , " says Carolyn Johnson of the Citizens Coal Council . " The Clinton administration made a conscious decision to back off enforcement of the federal mining law . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 90 percent of all environmental enforcement is carried out . When the states do discover violations , according to Nikki Tinsley , EPA 's Inspector General , they often assess penalties that are too small to offset the economic gain a polluter has reaped by breaking the law . Moreover , enforcement approaches vary wildly from state to state . This variability defeats the whole purpose of federal environmental laws , which were passed three decades ago to supply a common standard , so that poor states would not compete for the business of polluting industries in a " race to the bottom " That race is on again , according to many observers , and the EPA has done precious little to stop it . " The states do n't like to enforce the law , and frankly EPA does n't like to enforce the law either , " says one former high-level EPA official . <p> EPA officials respond that their own ( federal ) enforcement program is in good health , and there is some evidence for that : fines collected from polluters and civil referrals to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its larger role as a watchdog for the states , the agency has been far from vigilant . In 1998 the EPA 's Inspector General released a series of reports blasting several states for failing to police clean air and water laws . The stakes got higher a few months ago when a reporter for the trade journal Inside EPA began publishing internal EPA documents ( acquired through Freedom of Information Act requests ) that showed a drop-off in enforcement in almost every state . Amazingly , not a single mainstream newspaper or magazine reported on this . <p> When the reports were published in May , the states angrily disputed them . There were , in fact , some glaringly obvious arithmetical errors and a number of inaccurate statistics . But if the data are faulty , the states are partly to blame , because they submit them in the first place . " It 's not clear that anyone oversees or checks them , " says one veteran EPA observer . " The databases are all old , and they do n't communicate with each other ' The feds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be supervising this process . Instead , they often create more problems by failing to add and tally the data accurately . In some cases the EPA 's pollution categories do n't match up with those of the states . Sometimes even the EPA 's own categories do n't match up from year to year . This smog of confusion is self-perpetuating , and it makes it very hard to hold anyone accountable for failures to apply the law . <p> Still , the EPA will admit that enforcement activity has declined , as will some state officials  --  off the record . That 's when you start hearing about how the traditional " bean counting " approach to enforcement is obsolete , and how we need to emphasize helping businesses to comply , not policing them . As Virginia 's Secretary of Natural Resources told Congress in 1997 , " the truth is that enforcement action means failure , not success " Businesses understand the need for a clean environment and want to abide by the law . What they need is trust and encouragement , not the big stick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as " compliance assistance , " first emerged at the EPA in 1993 when Administrator Carol Browner approved a massive reorganization of EPA 's enforcement office , renaming it the Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assistance . Initially , compliance assistance was viewed as a supplement to traditional " deterrence-oriented " enforcement tactics like inspections and fines . Environmental laws can be dauntingly complex , and many businesses  --  especially small ones  --  lack the money and know-how to comply . Putting more effort into training made sense . <p> Yet compliance assistance took on a new coloration after the Republicans swept Congress in 1994 . Suddenly EPA was under ferocious attack , with Tom DeLay labeling it " the Gestapo of government " and Newt Gingrich calling it the enemy of small businesses across the country . Although the Republicans ' fury subsided in ' 96 , Browner was clearly under pressure to help the administration forge a political compromise with Congress and with the states , where a legion of newly-elected Republican governors was complaining about the costs of regulation . <p> The substance of this compromise was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditional enforcement . At EPA headquarters , for instance , the number of people doing enforcement work dropped from 340 in 1993 to 140 in 1997 . The states , which embraced compliance assistance much more quickly and wholeheartedly , tended to make deeper cuts in enforcement budgets and staff , with predictable results . <p> Some environmental observers argue that Browner should have known better . " Compliance assistance has always been a code word for ' do n't enforce the law , ' " says one former EPA official . While that may be an overstatement , there 's little doubt that the promoters of compliance assistance have exaggerated the rigidity and harshness of traditional enforcement . " Generally , violations have to be repeated and serious before they 're even considered , " says Clifford Rechtschaffen , an enforcement expert and professor at Golden Gate Law School . One extensive study of the Clean Water Act found that " the intent of the enforcement process " as it has traditionally been practiced is " not to punish violators but rather to coax them toward compliance . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't a good idea . It is telling , however , that when asked for a " compliance assistance " success story , or some indication that the new method works , EPA officials I spoke with were stumped . Finally I was referred to a program that educates drycleaners on how to properly dispose of the toxic chemicals they use . The federal EPA office based in New York City sought out over 200 drycleaners and even printed up instructions for them in Korean , just to make sure they understood what was required of them . But when I called the New York office to find out how the effort was going , I was told " Unfortunately , we 've found that there 's still only a very small number of drycleaners in compliance , and we 've had to move back toward an enforcement approach . " <p> Part of the problem with compliance assistance is that its successes are hard to measure . A 1998 GAO study found that there is no clear indication of how such efforts are working . When federal and state agencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicators such as the number of brochures distributed , or names on a conference sign-in list . Talk about bean-counting . <p> Whatever the original goals of compliance assistance , there 's no question that its " flexible " and " business-friendly " aspects are what have made it catch on like a cult in statehouses across the country in the past five years . Some states have supplemented the new approach with cabinet-level offices to run interference for businesses , helping them to cut deals or avoid penalties . Former Virginia Gov . George Allen pioneered this movement , modeling his own effort on former Vice President Dan Quayle 's Council on Competitiveness , which became notorious during the Bush administration for its efforts to gut environmental laws . New York Gov . George Pataki has followed suit with the Governor 's Office of Regulatory Reform . Technically , the office existed before , but only as a three-person ombudsman for small businesses . Now staffed by about thirty , the office was developed by Pataki 's current budget director Bob King , and " they are in the driver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says one source in the New York state government . " They 've had a major chilling effect on enforcement . " <p> There 's also no doubt that when states use compliance assistance without holding businesses accountable through inspections and a credible threat of enforcement , they are virtually inviting polluters to ignore the law . " There 's been a massive shift in the approach to enforcement , " says one New York state official . " The enforcement numbers have gone down . When you confront agency officials they say compliance is up . But there 's no way to check . What I 've heard from business is that no one is watching . They could n't be happier . " Taking It Easy <p> An avalanche of anecdotal information suggests that in this new era , officials who prosecute the law vigorously are often pressured to cool it . If they do n't , they face retaliation . Consider Captain Ronald Gatto , a cop in New York City 's Department of Environmental Protection . You might suppose that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani would be proud of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enforcement record to match Mayor Rudy 's . He has personally made 156 arrests for environmental crimes since 1990 , with a 100 percent conviction rate . The DEP 's police unit is tiny , and local environmentalists claim that Gatto is almost single-handedly responsible for protecting the network of reservoirs that supply the city 's drinking water . <p> But instead of rewarding Gatto for his good work , Giuliani 's administration has subjected him to a steady campaign of harassment , including denial of pay raises and promotions , and a series of probes of his conduct by the city 's Department of Investigations , all of which came up with nothing . ( In one instance the investigators broke into his office and stole his personal and police documents . ) Gatto and his unit have been so starved of necessary equipment that he was forced to buy his own police telephone , fax machine , video camera and the dye tablets necessary for conducting wastewater investigations . In June he was reassigned away from enforcement activities and effectively demoted . <p> Giuliani 's critics claim that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developers and politicians , who do n't like to see environmental laws getting in the way of business , and whose support happens to be vital to Giuliani 's upcoming Senate bid . Whatever the reasons , there 's no doubt that the mayor is flirting with disaster . If its water supply deteriorates much further , the city will be forced under federal law to construct a filtration plant for $8 billion , at an annual operating cost of $300 million . By then , of course , Rudy will either be sitting in the Capitol or in his favorite lawn chair . Either way , he wo n't be mayor . <p> Stories like Gatto 's may sound like something out of the movie " Chinatown " to the rest of us . But some regulators say they 're run of the mill . Take Beverly Migliore , who had been running the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management 's hazardous waste program for eight years when the department was reorganized in the mid-1990s . " We were under lots of pressure to be more business-friendly , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her decisions . " I 'm not a strict , high-penalty close  --  ' em down kind of person , " she says , but it soon became clear that her new supervisor " did n't believe in assessing penalties or even strongly worded statements " He began overriding her decisions , with the approval of the program director . In one case , a company called American Shipyard left drums full of solvents festering in a Newport shipyard for several years . Worried that the drums would erode and leak solvents into the bay , Migliore pressed her superiors to do something for two years . Finally she gave up and made a public statement . " Then I came back one afternoon and found my chief wheeling my computer out of my office into a closet . " She is now suing the department under state whistleblower laws . <p> A few months ago the EPA 's Inspector General filed a report that backs up Migliore 's claims , calling the state 's enforcement " inadequate " because " serious violations , such as leaking battery acid and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actions . Thus , the health and protection of the state 's population and environment was put at risk " <p> A series of recent federal audits suggests that Migliore 's experience is common in state enforcement bureaucracies . <p>  --  In Florida , an Escambia county grand jury issued a 120-page report in late June condemning the state Department of Environmental Protection and demanding that its regional director be replaced . Pointing to extensive pollution of the bays , rivers , bayous and beaches of the Florida Panhandle , the report concluded that " the district DEP director , and others acting on his behalf , ignored and concealed environmental violations against the sound advice of staff employees .... In several instances , he and or others acting in his behalf , disciplined or threatened to discipline DEP employees who tried to implement and enforce environmental laws " <p>  --  In Texas , where inspections and enforcement have dropped considerably in the past five years , regulators took an average of 651 days to complete enforcement actions for the ten significant violator cases reviewed by the EPA 's Inspector General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guidelines allow . Texas polluters often get off with no penalty at all . In the mid-1990s a French-owned uranium mining company injected radioactive water into the soil in Duval county . When the state environmental agency found out , the company offered to pay a large penalty . But the state , after initiating a criminal investigation , dropped it  --  and then failed to pursue any civil or administrative penalties . <p>  --  In Virginia , a scathing audit by the state 's General Assembly in 1996 found that the state failed to take enforcement actions against persistent and serious violators . One investigator concluded that the state 's regulators " work with industry and do n't enforce the law . " <p>  --  In Pennsylvania , EPA 's Inspector General found in 1997 that state regulators routinely failed to report significant violators because they wanted to avoid " federal meddling " Understandably suspicious of the state 's reports , auditors reviewed files for 270 of the state 's 2,053 major polluters and found 64 significant violators the state had failed to report . <p> In most cases , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because their funding and staff have been cut , or in response to a demand for more " business-friendly " policies . <p> But sometimes it 's an old-fashioned quid pro quo . In Connecticut , one of Gov . John Rowland 's officials literally demanded cash from polluters in exchange for easy treatment by the DEC , according to a report written by a group of state employees and published by Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility . The employees describe this scandal , which is currently under federal investigation , as only one part of a campaign which has " systematically dismantled the state 's enforcement program to the direct detriment of public health . " One of the many examples they provide : A chemical manufacturer whose executives were also Rowland campaign contributors caused a toxic spill which killed 12,000 fish , but paid no fine , thanks to a back room deal with the governor 's bag man . <p> State agencies are n't the only ones who cave in to polluters or their political flunkies . The EPA has ten regional offices spread throughout the country which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One regional official told me her administrator " will reduce or eliminate our enforcement response after congressmen get in touch with him . " This is a direct violation of EPA ethics rules  --  not to mention the public interest . But she claims that it happens in up to one quarter of the cases she oversees . The administrator has expressed interest in running for Congress and has no desire to alienate his future colleagues . " I had one case where we were told not to do a penalty , " says the official . " They allowed congressional aides to show up at the settlement negotiations on an enforcement case . We were instructed to zero out the penalty . " She adds that " most people are afraid to speak out because of reprisals . " Missing In Action <p> In theory , a regional EPA office can take its own enforcement action where the state has failed to do an adequate job . Yet " over-filing , " as it 's called , happens only a few times a year . The regions tend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's likely to infuriate congressmen and state politicians . Furthermore , the courts have been known to frown on overfiling , viewing it as double jeopardy for the polluter in question ( since they are subject to both state and regional actions ) . Eight years ago the regional EPA office in St. Louis discovered that a company called Harmon Electric , which manufactured electrical components for the railroad industry , had illegally dumped toxic solvents on its property over a period of several years . The solvents might easily have gotten into the groundwater , endangering the health of people living nearby . The state had done nothing , so the regional office investigated and sought a $2 million penalty against the company . Only then did the state file its own action , which did not include any penalty . In late 1994 an EPA administrative law judge set a penalty of $586,000 . After several years of appeals , the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in early September that the EPA had no right to overfile . <p> " This could have a massive chilling effect on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed the case . Supposing a company is caught dumping toxic waste on its property , threatening the health of thousands of people living nearby . The EPA might judge the company liable for millions of dollars in fines , based on the harm done and on similar cases . But suppose also that the state environmental commissioner owed a favor to the governor , who owed a favor to ( or wanted to please ) the company in question . The state could bring its own case , and demand a fine of only a few thousand dollars . If the Harmon precedent holds , the EPA could do nothing about it . <p> If a state is consistently refusing to apply the law , EPA does have the authority to revoke the state 's authority to enforce federal laws such as the Clean Air and Water acts . But this is virtually an empty threat . It has never happened , and as one law review article puts it , " the procedures for withdrawal of state programs would be suitable for the Nuremberg trials , and will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state program is enormously expensive , and as it is the EPA can barely afford to do its own meager share of enforcing environmental law . <p> Even the last resort in the face of failing government entities  --  citizen enforcement  --  has been weakened . Although citizen suits were envisioned as an important bulwark of enforcement in the major federal laws passed in the late ' 60s and early ' 70s , Congress barred them in 1987 in Clean Water Act cases where the state was " diligently prosecuting " the violation . Since then , the courts have tended to apply that standard to all environmental laws , and they have defined " diligent prosecution " to mean any kind of state action , including friendly negotiations . Silent But Deadly <p> Why has the failure of enforcement received so little attention  --  not only from politicians and the press , but from the environmental community itself ? For one thing , unlike signing an environmental bill into law , which makes a politician look like an instant hero , enforcing that law does n't offer much payoff . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's been doing it or not , the average politician may be out of office . Besides , complying with environmental laws costs money and creates enemies . Major environmental groups are also dependent on grants and donations , and enforcement does n't play well on the cocktail circuit . <p> The data smog that surrounds enforcement issues only makes matters worse . State and federal regulators routinely respond , when asked about declining enforcement rates , that the data ca n't be trusted . As if that were supposed to comfort us . An internal EPA report written earlier this year acknowledges that the agency 's data on " significant non-compliers " with environmental law are so poor , thanks to mismatches between state and federal definitions and databases , that they are not reporting it for this year . <p> One thing that is clear , however , is that companies can not be trusted to comply with environmental laws out of the goodness of their hearts . The data may not be perfect , but they do suggest that where enforcement is down , compliance with the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they 're going to " get tough " on crime , they had better get tough on environmental offenders as well . <p> Luckily , there 's some evidence that tougher laws can make a difference . New Jersey 's Clean Water Enforcement Act , passed in 1995 , includes mandatory minimum penalties for serious violations and significant noncompliance , and requires that penalties recover the economic gain polluters have realized through noncompliance . In other words , the state has insisted ( unlike most other states ) on an enforcement program with teeth . So far , the warning appears to have worked : Clean Water Act violations have dropped 78 percent since 1992 . <p> That should hardly be surprising . Street crime has dropped in the past five years , thanks to more vigorous policing of minor offenses . Maybe it 's time we put the environmental cops back on the beat too . Soft on Crime <p> The EPA and state environmental agencies are n't the only ones who do n't enforce the law . The Justice Department shares with EPA the job of prosecuting environmental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of the most experienced environmental prosecutors in the country , claims that the DOJ under Clinton has dropped the ball . " Under Bush , environmental prosecutions were a top priority , " he says . " At the first meeting of the criminal chiefs under Clinton , they announced a list of top priorities , and environment was n't on it . They wo n't admit that publicly ... but the truth is , environment is no more a priority than guano smuggling . There just is no enforcement . " The record confirms Sasse 's impressions . According to a recent study published by Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility ( PEER ) and reviewed by a committee of assistant U.S. attorneys , prosecution of environmental crimes has fallen sharply during the Clinton administration . As another US attorney told PEER : " Under the Clinton administration , environmental crimes have only been a paper priority ; there has been no real commitment of resources , expertise or organizational muscle . " <p> Another arm of government that has slacked off is the Army Corps of Engineers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also tasked with helping to maintain the nation 's wetlands . This is a critical environmental area , because wetlands serve as natural filters , helping to maintain our supply of clean water ( as well as being a rich source of plant and animal life ) . Despite Clinton 's proclaimed policy of " no net loss " of wetlands , the U.S. still loses 100,000 acres a year . <p> But the Corps has dropped its inspections by 40 percent since 1992 , and many employees claim they are under heavy pressure to please developers and approve projects quickly . " Nationally , the Corps is backing off enforcement to the point where it 's kind of in name only , " says Maggie Shapiro , who resigned from the Corps in 1996 and who was once told by her supervisor " You do your job too well . " She cites a recent example of the Corps 's failure : In 1996 , Virginia Gov . George Allen began attracting businesses to an area that is upstream of the Chickahominy Swamp , a Mecca for botanists and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a multi-project industrial park , posed a threat to at least one endangered plant species known as the Swamp Pink . The Fish and Wildlife Service recommended a formal consultation . But the Corps simply ignored them , without doing any consultation or research of its own . " I have never in my life seen the documented presence of an endangered species ignored by the Corps , " says Shapiro . " It 's an example where big business , lots of money and power politics has overridden the Corps 's enforcement of its own regulations .
