The band launches into a furious dance tune and someone grabs my waist , pitching me forward . I look back , and to my horror I see 20 drunken dinner guests lined up ready to follow in a dancing train . I start to panic at the sight of this twisted , Latin hokey-pokey . I have no choice but to begin prancing around the dining room at the head of the line . Every year , serious skiers pick a different ski area to get buzzed about . Last summer it was a place in Chile called Termas de Chillan . SKIING Magazine sent photographer T.R. Youngstrom and me down there for a week to get the real scoop . Wanting to share the wealth , we recruited two of the best free-skiers in the world , Shane McConkey and Kent Kreitler , to join us . A fully pampered week at a luxury resort is not our usual kind of thing . Termas is for people with real jobs , and lives , and who can afford the best . We 're used to sleeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tickets . We eat ramen . We did n't know what to expect or how to behave . Still in the dance train , after a few laps skipping ( dada-dada-da ) and pointing ( hey ) , I realize I 'm actually starting to enjoy this . At this moment it 's clear , the transformation is complete . Like chameleons able to adapt to new backgrounds , we have become one with Termas de Chillan . Finally , a new level of recreational intensity The temperature was 100 degrees in Utah as I stepped onto the first of many southbound airplanes , My nose was running , of course , after packing all that ski equipment , but I was happy . There is something magical about flying from summer to winter . It 's like being in a Disney movie where you fall asleep and through magic get transported to a faraway and strange land . Reaching Termas required 24 hours of travel in planes trains , taxis , and vans . I did n't know my traveling companions very well , but this adventure really let us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game of " would you rather " one of the many ploys we used to pass the time , T.R. declared he would rather kill his best friend than allow a busload of Pakistani schoolchildren to die . Kent had decided to stop speaking like a California guy ; to assist him , he asked us to slap him every time he said " dude . " Shane showed us the many tricks he has mastered : wiggling his ears , flaring his nostrils , turning his tongue upside down , twisting his lips in opposite directions , and folding back his eyelids . Obviously , on this trip , solving the world 's problems would not be our concern . While I 'm throwing my hips from side to side in sync with the other guests like I 'm bred for the task , and nearing hokey-pokey saturation , the boys are in the bar buying $50 worth of alcohol for a haggard group of local snowboarders . Kent and Shane found them asleep on the bar couches . No matter that they do n't speak a word of English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need their help . As we approached total collapse after the eight-hour overnight flight from Miami to Santiago , Kent had the whole airport staff ripping the plane apart looking for his missing sunglasses . While they searched he ( oops ) found them in his backpack , and we quietly slipped away in a cab . Santiago is a very modern city ( no chickens anywhere ) with a good many late-night discos , few blonds , and a great opportunity to watch thousands of 12-year-olds smoking cigarettes . Always obligated to check out new places , we spent 24 hours there . My sleeveless shirt caused a scandal with the local men , and we almost got arrested for throwing a kiwi over the hotel 's nine-story balcony , but the snow was calling and we escaped south . Termas de Chillan is a bouncy five-hour train ride and a severely potholed two-hour van ride from Santiago . On the train we passed endless fields of soccer games and trees growing in rows , drank bad yellow soda , and listened to T.R. talk endlessly about skiing . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the short time I had been hanging with T.R , he had mentioned killing his best friend and selling his grandmother . I was getting edgy . I suggested maybe he could sell her to someone nice . The band is dressed in white tuxedos and playing louder than usual . Our waiter , Victor , is all bunchy about the three snowboarders dining with us , so I give him an enormous end-of-the-week tip . The band breaks into a Muzak version of " Funkytown , " and I grab his waist , forcing him to dance . He squirms and gets away . The night we arrived it was pouring rain , and we could n't see the mountain . Our first impression was grim . We unloaded our bags , walked into the resort lobby , and there was famous moviemaker Greg Stump . Stump 's a pretty cool guy , and his presence gave us hope . Then we learned that Chillan is one of Glen Plake 's favorite hangouts , so suddenly Termas de Chillan seemed ultra hip . So hip that while walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing half naked in a window . ( It was a false alarm ; everyone in Chile looks like Tomba . ) Although many Americans are n't aware of it , a large and important ski culture exists in South America . In our summer-time , while we roast weenies and smell like chlorine up north , South Americans are taking their ski vacations very seriously . And differently . Like many South American resorts , Termas de Chillan operates in packaged weekly cycles , where all the guests spend that time together as a group . It 's unusual for visitors to just show up and buy day tickets , although some random folks do trickle through . It feels very private , exclusive : Stuff the place with more than 400 people , and all of Termas would panic . To be honest , Termas is not a ski area , it 's more a resort that happens to have skiing . " Termas " means hot spring , " Chillan " is a town two hours away , famous for its earthquakes and sausages . The resort is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us swoon and big , beautiful , black trees hung with green moss like a scene from my childhood Peter and the Wolf picture book . The huge , natural hot-spring swimming pool is the main tourist attraction . The resort consists of just one hotel and four condos ( with plans for the addition of a 100-room five-star hotel ) . Activities , aside from skiing and the pool , range from spa treatments to a disco and a video arcade . Facilities include the usual ski shops , a bar , and two restaurants , although everyone eats from a fixed menu at the hotel restaurant and ignores the other place . ( The hotel restaurant was a treat , with the exception of clogged pepper shakers that frustrated Shane to near hysteria . ) In other words , the resort seems like a perfect family vacation or honeymoon spot , where folks can relax and have lots to do , and plenty of time to do it . This scene was not familiar to us gringo extreme skiers at all . It was for wealthy South American family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen snow before . Practically no one , including the women at the front desk , spoke English . The band in the dining room constantly played show tunes and elevator music . When I first met our waiter , Victor , and said those magic words  --  " O.J. Simpson "  --  I got only a blank look and more bread in return . Where did we fit in ? In the ticket office , we stared at four blown-up photos of the same skier in various stages of crashing . In one shot the poor guy was floating five feet in the air , about to do a face plant into some rocks . ( Obviously the last shot of the day . ) Who , except someone deeply confused about the concept of skiing would choose photos like these to decorate the walls at the ticket counter ? Was this odd little resort really our kind of place ? To find out we went skiing . Imagine a starving monkey going after a banana . That was us . We attacked It did n't matter that the weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a week straight . The mountain was still choked with snow . Within the first hour the ski patrol yelled at us three times for overzealous exploration . Apparently the extreme aspect of our skiing disturbed them . We immediately found Ricardo , the head of the ski school ( and a fine ski school it is ) , and asked him to get the patrol off our backs . " No problem , " he replied . No problem ? Imagine telling a North American ski area " Yeah , I 'm ducking the ropes and skiing really fast and the patrollers are giving me a hard time . Tell them to knock it off , will yah ? " and being told " No problem . " I liked it . Darting both in and out of bounds , we had the most creative skiing experience of our lives . Because the mountain is an active volcano shaped by lava flows , there are natural ridges , enormous and scary cornices , rolls , halfpipes , and knobs everywhere . We could traverse a face and discover a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chile powder ( left ) . ( Photo omitted ) Here skied by Glen Plake . To find good snow we had to pay attention  --  both because this was the southern hemisphere , and the sun shines opposite from what we 're used to ( south-facing , not north-facing slopes give the goods ) , and because the rain and wind had shredded the snow . The condition changed radically every time we switched exposures . In a typical day we experienced mush , severe bulletproof , corn , dry snow , windblown , and crust . By some glorious miracle we even found powderlike turns ( despite the rain ) on the west-facing ridges . T.R 's grandmother could relax . There were so many reasons to worship the place . No lift lines ( hallelujah ) . The area is above tree line and has mostly T-bars and pomas . With so much snow , the towers were nearly buried ; the tops of the towers were at waist level . Termas de Chillan boasts the longest chairlift in South America ( the Don Otto , 800 feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and due to strong winds , rarely open . Here 's the real winner : Because the resort is on an active volcano and there 's sulfur clouding out of the ground in many spots , no need to blame it on Fido or the guy standing nearby . In an attempt to find and " shralp the gnarl , " or " extreminate , " we wandered farther and farther from the lifts . We could n't believe how good the snow was after an uncommon two weeks of rain . Everything was smoothed over and completely untouched . We found long , mysteriously dry powder runs , and smooth , steep rocky chutes . We explored an old , wrecked cabin , signed the guest book , and chased one another around with rusty axes . One evening , Shane and I stayed out on the mountain until 7 P.M. to hike up the back side of a peak and ski 2,000 vertical feet of nasty , gluelike mush . We loved this kind of torture Earning our living as professional skiers has left us a bit jaded about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few seasons would be more than fine . Friendships were started . Many ski-school instructors , although not allowed to wander out of bounds , started following us on our treks and finally visiting us daily in our condo . The boys became really good at flirting in Spanish . We invited our favorite comrade and homeboy , Ricardo , to join us for dinner every night . Every time we visited the termas pool , which was often , we noisily bonded with the vacationers by jumping off the 10-foot-high snowbanks into the water , encouraging their small , scared children to do the same . Soon we knew everyone . Our poolside manner was notorious . Long after it closed at night we dragged random guests and locals there to skinny-dip Every night the same security guard and his damn flashlight caught us , not quite out of our skivvies , and sent us away like bad doggies . The buffet is choked with hungry , plate-holding vacationers and all of us jumping up and down , dancing with our snowboarder friends . The energy level is humming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my God , Shane  --  gets the pepper shaker to work There 's no turning back now . Suddenly the band starts a furious Chilean song , and the waiters line up and simultaneously set fire to 10 huge , erupting volcanoes of ice cream . The volcanoes start spitting flames , a musician yells , " Termas de Chillan " and the waiters begin circulating around the room . As good as the skiing was , our whole lives revolved around the dinner table . The resort demanded that . Mealtime was a ritual . Victor was always our waiter . There was always a large , fantastic buffet with dozens of people grabbing for food as if they were playing some crazy , unorganized Twister game . We were forced to sit at the same table every meal . If we tried to rebel , the host would wag his finger until we moved back into our same dark corner . They never let us wear ski boots into the dining room , so we made a statement by dumping them in a watery heap by the entrance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as we walked toward our table , we would think , " Hey , were n't we just here ? " But we got so used to the high volume of food that T.R. , on assignment to shoot photos , took film out of his backpack to make room for extra sandwiches . Maybe the Twilight Zone band was the lure that kept us coming back for more . Who were these four middle-aged guys playing amusement-park music ? They were n't ski bums . Their music belonged in an Audrey Hepburn movie , not our hardcore ski vacation . The first sign the boys were becoming " Chillaned " came when Kent turned to me blankly and hummed four notes from a song the band had played a half hour before . His mind was completely in a Termas de Chillan moment . After this , at every meal we struggled through the hard times , stuffing ourselves and itching to dance . But with all that food , it was n't safe  --  we might cramp . The music in the disco is a hypnotic rave beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kent 's private CD collection . The DJ was a bit confused at first , but now he 's spinning their disks , swinging his hips like Elvis . We were becoming punchier by the minute , living in the alternate universe that is Termas de Chillan . In between slap ping Kent ( that " dude " thing ) and watching Shane perform his facial stunts , our conversation became a bit less than lucid . Did we brush our teeth by moving our head or our brush ? Are 20-watt lightbulbs more depressing than no lightbulbs ? We argued for hours about whether or not cows are aware of their own existence , and when they roamed free in great wild herds , were they more intelligent than they are now ? It was difficult reaching any conclusions . In between helpings of flan , we had staring contests and practiced posing for romance-novel covers . The resort played its own silly part . Our hosts staged hat contests , dance contests , and tie contests ( the guy with the big piece of lettuce on his chest won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and having only 30 CD 's to work with , the DJ played really bad music . Plus , everybody insisted on wearing bathing suits in the termas bath . Until our last night , that is . This time , I confronted the security guard and his flashlight , gave him the ol ' wink and nudge , and pointed toward the pool . He smiled , nodded slyly , and went whistling off in the other direction . We started running toward the door leading out to the pool , ripping off clothes , followed by a half dozen whooping snowboarders , locals , and tourists . As the night wound down , we soaked in the hot water , talking about our last day skiing in Termas . Finally , after a week of wind and rain , the sun had come out and the patrol had opened the Don Otto chair . Having already hiked high to access the off-piste terrain near the chair , we had ridden the creaking , ancient lift just to pay tribute to the volcano gods . We also talked about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell there 's only endless , hard-packed mogul skiing , and we ( ouch ) blow our knees out every ( ouch ) couple of turns . In I heaven we ski powder all day , and after every run we look back at our tracks , then sssst , they disappear . Termas was not quite heaven-on-earth during our stay , but it was close enough .

The Resort The village is below tree line and has charm unlike the above-tree-line landscapes of other South American resorts , such as Las Lenas Argentina , and Valle Nevado , Chile . Since the resort is compact and most guests are on weeklong packages , the resort has a cruise-ship atmosphere . One of the best places to mingle after skiing or before dinner is in the sulfur pools or the thermal pool at the Hotel Pirigallo . The Club House bar and restaurant , located on the mountain above the hotel , has the feel of a hunting lodge  --  it 's a cigar-smoking , card-playing kind of place . The resort 's spa offerings include sulfur baths , mud therapy , massage , hydromassage sauna , and steam baths , plus a complete beauty and health spa . <p>
