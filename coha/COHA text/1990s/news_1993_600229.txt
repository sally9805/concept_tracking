<p> PORTLAND , Ore . Cheryl Bickle sits in a rocking chair in her first- through third-grade classroom , with five girls kneeling around her on the carpet drawing pictures of cocoons . <p> From the work sheet they 're coloring , Bickle reads , " In seven days he turned into a . . . " <p> " A beautiful butterfly , " one of the girls chimes in . <p> Not a bad metaphor , actually , for what 's going on in this classroom inside the aging , five-story brick building that houses the YWCA of Portland . <p> Here , the YWCA Transitional School looks out for the educational needs of homeless children about 55 a day , though the number varies as kids come and go . It 's well-known that such kids are behind academically , but Bickle , the school director , says their troubles go deeper than that . <p> " I think they 're really behind in being able to sit down and try , " Bickle says . " I 'm not a psychologist , but I feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line anymore . " <p> Education for the nation 's homeless children has gotten increasing attention the last few years . But with that attention has come the recognition of the emotional scars left on kids who have to worry more about where they 'll sleep than whether they get their math homework done . <p> " These are intensely needy kids , " says Cathy Jones , executive director of the YWCA of Portland . <p> " There 's a good parallel with migrant education , " says James Stronge , a consultant on homeless education and an education professor at the College of William and Mary , Williamsburg , Va . " But there 's a noted distinction . For migrant students , there 's a well-established educational network , and that 's not true for homeless students . The barriers are just beginning to come down for homeless students . And when they 're in school , they 're still not succeeding . " <p> But they 're trying at schools like this in Portland . <p> A $ 20,000 van donated by the Junior League of Portland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelters and hotels . The route changes every day . Kids in one shelter one day may not be in the same one the next . <p> They trundle out to the van looking like any other sleepy kids starting a day , but each represents a struggle . <p> Like E'Money Hale , 8 , whose mother , Angie Stidum , is getting back on her feet after battling cocaine and alcohol . E'Money goes home every afternoon to a warehouse-like brick building converted to a shelter . Stidum knows the YWCA school helps : E'Money read her first book a month ago . <p> " It 's fun , " E'Money says . " There 's a lot of kids I can play with . " <p> Kids ride elevators to the classrooms , but the three R 's are only part of what they get . Their day starts and ends with food breakfast on arrival and snacks when they leave . <p> Most school kids would n't need afternoon snacks , but Bickle says many of these kids go to shelters where dinner is n't served until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snack until dinner , " she says . " They 're usually so hungry . " <p> Mostly , they crave attention . That 's why one of the volunteers here , " Grandma Dorothy " Reynoldson , has a rocking chair where she reads to kids and hugs them . <p> " There 's no time for a teacher in a public school to do that , " Jones says . <p> One of the Y 's members , Joanne Carlson , started the school after seeing a TV program about a homeless school in Seattle . She canvassed Portland 's shelters and hotels and found that half the homeless kids were not in school . The Portland city school system now gives the YWCA school $ 130,000 a year . <p> " There was plenty of need , " Carlson says . " There still is . We could probably open up two or three of these schools . " <p> Still , access to schools has improved for homeless kids since Congress passed the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act in 1987 . Among other things , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The vast majority of homeless children are served at regular public schools . The McKinney Act specifies that 's the preferred treatment rather than putting homeless children in separate schools and reinforcing the stigma . <p> But the heads of the Portland YWCA school see real benefits to kids in separate schools where they do n't have to explain to others why their home is a shelter , a motel or a station wagon . <p> " In this group , everybody 's in the same situation , " Jones says . " That 's why not mainstreaming is important . It gives them a peer group they do n't have to hide anything from . " <p> And their stories are always tough to digest . <p> Take Aaron Burbach , 8 1/2 . Big flop of curly brown hair . Wears glasses with lenses like Coke-bottle bottoms . <p> One of his more recent homes : a shelter in the basement of a Portland church where he and his mom shared four bunks with other families at least until 8 a.m . That 's when the rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting a little boring , " Aaron says . <p> Then there 's Deidre Hagen , 13 , a blond seventh-grader , who likes playing journalist . But when interviewed about her own life and the fact she 's lived in 45 states already she wraps her arms around her notebook and rocks unconsciously . <p> " It 's like anytime we get settled down someplace , we have to move again for some reason , " Deidre says . " As soon as we make friends , we have to leave again . " <p> Experts say the largest benefit of schools like these may be the certainty they provide in an uncertain world . <p> " For a lot of homeless kids , school may be the only stable thing in their lives , " says Joan Alker , assistant director , National Coalition for the Homeless . <p> Indeed , soon after the interviews for this story , Deidre Hagen and her sister were taken by their mother to live in Montana , the school staff says . Meanwhile , Aaron Burbach also left after his mother found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typically come to school one to three years behind academically , Stronge says . They can make up some ground , depending on their social and emotional problems . <p> " I think the really tough part is when they 've been with you for a while and they really are starting to take off , " Bickle says . " And you know their potential and you know what great children they really are , and they just disappear . " <p> How large is the problem ? <p> The number of homeless children in the U.S. is substantial , though everyone admits estimates vary widely . <p> James Stronge , the College of William and Mary , Williamsburg , Va. , says estimates run from 225,000 to half a million . That includes the kids still with their parents , as well as the runaways and throwaways kids tossed out of their homes . <p> The percentage of those children who are not in school is dropping though still high . <p> Joan Alker , assistant director , National Coalition for the Homeless , says 33% of those children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago . Now state reports show the total down to 18% , " but we have to take those statistics with a grain of salt , " Alker says . They 're self-reported by states and may not include many children the states simply do n't know about , she says .
