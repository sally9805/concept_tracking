Call him Dieter . Do not expect much in the way of personal data  --  his exact age , his address , his last name . As far as Dieter is concerned , the only fact that has any meaning these days is that until a few months ago , he was a member of the Staatssicherheitsdienst , the now defunct secret-police force known and reviled by East Germans as the Stasi . Once employment by the elite Stasi was a way of life . Now it is the curse of Dieter 's existence . " Everybody has forgotten that we worked to make this country safe , " he says . " We were the true believers , and now we are left with no jobs , no security , no safety net . " <P> What Dieter is left with is his anger , his bitterness and his fear . As the young man chain-smokes acrid Club cigarettes and glances nervously at passersby in an East Berlin hotel lobby , he notes that common citizens are now policing the former Stasis . Many tradesmen refuse service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ petrol , and job notices often specify that dismissed Stasis need not apply . When three ex-agents showed up at an East Berlin slaughterhouse in search of jobs , workmen locked them in a storage refrigerator for two hours . The Stasis no longer feel safe even in their own homes . " My friends have had their windows smashed , and they get threatening letters , " says Dieter . " If they report it , the police do n't investigate . " <P> Though the Stasis propped up an unpopular Communist regime for more than four decades and were notorious for their disregard of privacy and occasional beatings of prisoners , Dieter can not understand why so much loathing is aimed his way . He insists he was only a maintenance man in a Stasi center , a mere speck in an elaborate organization that not only offered full-time employment to 85,000 people but also provided pocket money to a network of 109,000 citizens who snooped on their neighbors and co-workers . <P> The Stasi has been disbanded , although a few dozen former officials remain on the payroll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dossiers on an estimated 5 million individuals . The supervision has not been leakproof : two prominent politicians were ruined by disclosures that they served as Stasi informants , and ex-agents are suspected of providing the damaging leaks . There are also rumors that a ring of former Stasi agents is using the files to blackmail ex-informers . <P> Unlike most of his former colleagues , Dieter has found work  --  this time as a regular policeman in East Berlin . He has started walking a beat , and earns a monthly wage of 1,600 East German marks , which is worth about $330 in buying power and is almost equal to his Stasi pay . ( A few former agents have even found employment as policemen in West Germany . ) But Dieter has lost a packet of coveted perks , among them paid vacations at choice resorts along the Baltic coast . Because the Stasis were in a special category set apart from the typical East German civil servant , he received no unemployment pay . <P> For Dieter , the revolution has been a betrayal . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who " misused us as tools for their private purposes " and by his superiors . " Most of them grabbed state pensions and disappeared , " he says . " They have little people like me to bear their burdens . "
