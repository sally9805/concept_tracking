THE PAINTING <p> They knew of Etta Weston 's gallery mainly through her sister , Sarah , who was a birding friend of Connie 's . But they had n't been to any exhibitions until they really got serious about finding a painting for the large wall in the living room . Then in the mail came the invitation to a new show featuring the landscapes of area artists . So , they thought , why not , and they drove to the east side of town through the exclusive village of Montevista , back through the wooded roads past spike-gated homes whose chimneys and tile roofs were barely visible behind high walls or thick hedges of oleander and agave cactus . And at length they arrived at a narrow lane of poplars , guarded on either side by two princely lions perched on stucco columns . They turned in , as the directions indicated , and drove to the end . The gallery , a Ushaped ranch-style house , was nestled in a grove of oak and palms . A large stone fountain bubbled cheerfully in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except for an elderly couple and Etta 's daughters who were preparing the wine and hors d'oeuvre table on the rear patio . Etta saw them as soon as they entered the open door . <p> " Hi , " she said coming up . " Connie ! " she exclaimed , suddenly recognizing her . " Oh my goodness ! How nice to see you again ! " <p> There was a genuine lilt in her voice and she and Connie embraced . Etta was a tall attractive woman in her early forties ; she had a steady honest smile and an intense manner that made you like her immediately . Connie introduced him , and the two women quickly fell into a chat about Sarah and the first time they had met some years before Etta opened her gallery . While they exchanged news , he decided to look around . The gallery was really a home rigged as a showplace for paintings . There were four or five rooms of varying size , some with furniture , some without , and about fifteen to twenty paintings on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inviting spread , well-lighted with huge windows and glass French doors looking out on a tennis court , a large pool , and a generous lawn . <p> People began to arrive , and finally Connie joined him and they walked slowly through every room , stopping here and there to debate the possibilities of a painting that caught their eye : was it the right size ? would it go with this or that in the room ? and so on . But nothing really happened . And gradually the feeling was sinking in that within a week any of the paintings they were considering would lose its interest and cease to be seen as anything more than a fashionable accessory for which they had paid too much money . All of them were competently done scenes of windswept oaks leaning into golden hillsides , distant ranches dwarfed by foothills , eucalyptus trees soaring into cerulean skies along ravines and seacliffs , the sweep of the Sur , and so on . <p> " Obligatory California , " he thought to himself . <p> They were about to leave in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how nice it was to see them again . <p> " You 're at the university ? " Etta asked him . <p> " Yes , " he said . <p> " Which department ? " <p> " I 'm in philosophy . " <p> " How interesting , " Etta exclaimed . " I do n't even know what philosophers do . They think , do n't they ? " <p> " Yes . They sit around and think of ways to get tenure . " <p> " He 's writing a book about his glasses , " Connie said . <p> " Very funny , Connie , " he said . <p> " A whole book ? About glasses ? Oh , that 's a joke ? " Etta said . <p> " It 's a kind of metaphor , " he said . <p> " For what ? " <p> " Well-you do n't really want to know , do you ? " " You see what you 've got me into , " he said to Connie . <p> " Yes , yes I do ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or less . " <p> " It 's a metaphor for seeing . The idea is that perception is a kind of blindness , or corrected vision . There is no such thing as pure vision . We all wear colored glasses . Anyway , I 'm fooling around with that idea . It 's been around since Plato , I 'm afraid . It 's kind of boring . " <p> " Not at all , " Etta said . <p> Connie leaned forward . " And what is so funny , Etta , is that half the time he ca n't find his own glasses . And sometimes he 's wearing them ! " <p> " Ha ha , " he said . " Just like your car keys . " Then they all laughed and the conversation turned to the exhibit . They explained that they had been looking for a painting for a special space but had n't seen anything suitable . No offense : it was a matter of the right colors or size , something that would give the right depth to the room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her finger aloft . " There would be a proof of your theory , right ? You see only what you 're looking for . " <p> " You 're a natural philosopher , " he said . " Thank you . You 've given me new hope . " And they laughed again . <p> " I do have some more things in the back room , " Etta said . <p> " You might look through them . " And , out of courtesy , they followed her into a large closet-room where paintings filled every inch of wall space and were stacked upright in a large openfaced wooden cabinet . They browsed a bit but , for the most part , found much the same thing they had seen in the gallery . Then , as they were drifting out to the main room , he noticed on top of the cabinet , in plain sight , a large dark painting of a very . . . very different sort . <p> " Ohh , look at that , " they both said , almost together . Etta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The painting was about four feet square , and framed in a narrow band of black wood . In the foreground , just to the left of center , was the silhouette of a large eucalyptus , its details obscured in the shadows of dusk or early morning , it would be hard to say which . It was situated at the crossing of two country roads , one of which ran diagonally up left , the other off to the right , slightly downhill along a low rolling field and out of sight . Two thin telephone poles with single cross-bars near the top rose into an iridescent sky . So dark was the eucalyptus that one could barely see the STOP sign and the crossing street light ( unlit ) through the shadows . What was remarkable was the color , the softness and simplicity of the shapes , and the immense depth achieved by the retreating road . It was an ominous scene , almost preternatural in its starkness , not at all the kind of place one would want to be caught carless , at dusk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , coppers , and browns drew one in , as if it were not so much a place that was depicted as a sensory state , almost gustatory in its appeal . Immediately , it struck him as being anachronistic , almost classical , like certain dark paintings by Rembrandt , except that Rembrandt would have used such an intersection only as a background to some human drama , Biblical or mythological . But there were no humans in this painting . It was , quite simply , a tree , a crossroads , and a sky . <p> They looked at it for some time , in silence . Finally Etta joined them . <p> " Who did this ? " he asked her . <p> " A man named Brahm , Lars Brahm . He 's a friend of mine . " <p> " It 's stunning , " he said , half-aloud . <p> " Is n't it nice . It was in my last show , but I did n't have room for it this time . I think people find it too gloomy . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . <p> " Yes , " Etta said . " The place does n't look at all like that in reality . " And she explained that she had been with Brahm on the afternoon he sketched the tree at Casmalia , about forty miles up the road . She and Brahm often scouted the countryside together , she for photo shots and he for painting subjects . <p> " It 's a real tree , then ? " Connie asked . <p> " Well , yes . But it 's right in the middle of the town . You ca n't see that in the painting of course . " <p> " And his name is Brahm , you say ? " he asked . <p> " Yes . Lars Brahm . " <p> " That 's an odd name , " Connie said . <p> " It 's part Swedish and part German , " Etta said . " It has a wonderful sound , does n't it ? - as if you 'd swept a broom across a harp- " Brahmmm ! " She made a sweeping motion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " Harp is exactly right . It makes a deep harp sound . " <p> So they bought it for more than they had ever thought about spending for a work of art . But they reasoned that it was an investment . Of course they knew nothing about art investments , but it seemed reasonable that Brahm would be discovered , in a matter of time , and the painting would be worth a good deal more . <p> But this had nothing to do with why he wanted the painting . Nor could he have said why he wanted it . While the tree and the telephone poles and the translucent sky and the vanishing road were like trees and roads and skies one saw everywhere in " obligatory " California , this painting had nothing to do with imitating nature . It was not a landscape ; it was a vision , of what he could not say but the painting summoned a deeply unsettling feeling , both of dread and familiarity . It was as if Brahm had seen this great leonine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anguished animal-as looking off into the expanse at something at once terrifying and intimate , a loneliness beyond description . <p> They hung the painting and the effect was beyond his highest expectations . Even more important , as the days passed he did not tire of it in the least , as he had feared . Increasingly , his mind wandered away from his book and he found himself standing in the living room , looking at it . It grew on him , and his pride in owning it , in having discovered it cast aside in the spare room , gave way to an extraordinary feeling of ownership of a very different sort . It seemed almost as if Brahm had looked into his soul and painted what he saw there . Who was this Brahm that he also knew this ? How could he have seen this dark truth , whatever name it might be given , that had pushed itself out of the solitude of his being into the light of day ? <p> Before long , he had examined every inch of the painting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defects , half hoping , half fearing to find them . Surely it was n't a perfect painting . <p> " You really like it , do n't you ? " Connie said to him one afternoon as he was gazing at it . <p> " There 's always something new in it , " he said , embarrassed at being caught alone with it . <p> " Yes , it 's so nice . " <p> And , indeed , it became his habit , when he was alone in the house in the bright light of mid-day , to get out his large reading glass and ponder the details of each passage . Wherever he put the glass , he found no defects , only the miracle of a new scene , as if there were paintings within the painting , each one a variation on a single overwhelming theme , and he ended up regretting that his glass did n't have higher powers of magnification for surely there were even smaller paintings beyond these . <p> One afternoon a few weekends after they bought the painting , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find the tree . <p> " It 's such a nice day , " he said . " You can bird , and we 'll look for the tree . " <p> Etta had given them sketchy directions about how to get there . So they drove northwest , a wonderful drive through the same country that all the other artists at the exhibition had painted in all its familiar hues and moods . Casmalia was a small town near the sea , virtually one street wide , surrounded by pastures in which cattle grazed . But nowhere did they see a tree that was sufficiently like the tree in the painting . In fact , the problem was that in the glare of daylight all the eucalyptus trees now looked like " their tree . " But a real tree did exist somewhere in the area and , though it had certainly been altered under Brahm 's brush , he wanted to see it and take a photo , simply because he was curious about the painting 's origins , about what in the mundane world could possibly have given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking several shots of possible trees , they saw a large eucalyptus on the edge of town , as Etta had said , that was not only similar in shape but offered the same arrangement of crossings and stop sign and street light that were in the painting . And after some debate , ending in a mild argument , they decided that must be the right tree and crossing . But what a transformation ! And there , he thought , was the difference between Brahm and the others . Who but a true master could have seen such an apocalyptic vision of the world on such a street corner ? It was well worth the trip . A small thing , to be sure , but somehow he felt flushed with success , as if having found the real tree he had found a partial solution to the obtuse mystery for which he could not find a name . Suffice to say that he felt he had taken another step into the privacy of Brahm 's mind , caught the artist , as it were , in the act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting it to his own uses . And the whole matter was made even more intriguing because the tree itself was so trivial . <p> One day the idea crossed his mind that he should write something about the painting . Somehow he longed to express what he felt . After all , was he not the world 's leading authority on this painting-indeed , on Brahm himself , whom he knew-without knowing him-like a book ? He would write a story of some sort , a fiction perhaps-if only because a critique of the painting seemed a contamination of everything it meant to him . Still he delayed , only thought about the project , what form it might take . Then one evening , when Connie was away on a birding trip up north , he brought a tablet and pen from his study and he sat down on the chair opposite the painting . It was an ideal opportunity . He could now look at it with impunity , undistracted by conversation or the presence of another human being . He could indulge his obsession to the limit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips . So , like a voyeur , he cupped his hands into a tunnel and brought them to his eyes , like field glasses , an enhancing device he had discovered in his many daily examinations of the painting 's surface . Instantly , the colors and shapes leapt out vividly as if they had been released by a spring . The painting lost all sense of being something hanging there on the wall and became a window onto a world , the great tree revealing all the green underpainting that was lost in the gloss of artificial room light , the deep copper and umber of the slick melancholy road vanishing , as if in a glistening rain , into the gray mist relieved only by the retreating telephone poles which-he now saw for the first time-resembled crosses . He was inspired . <p> On the top line of the pad he scrawled <p> DOWN THE ROAD <p> and was instantly satisfied with its simplicity . Then , as if he had turned a key in a lock , he began to set down exactly what came to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he would be its secretary , much as Brahm , he imagined , had been the secretary who recorded the vision hiding somewhere in the Casmalia tree . So he began writing , on and on , losing all track of time , coming in and out of awareness of where he was , taking little " breaks " to look at the painting , just as a painter in the field might now and then consult the real landscape beyond his brush . <p> But no matter where his gaze fell it was drawn down the road . Of course this is what vanishing points are for . But this was a different matter . It seemed that the tree was somehow facing down the road and that the suffused gray mist gave off a radiance , as if this scene were only the prelude to something beyond it , that down that road something unpainted and unpaintable lay in wait . What could it be ? Surely not houses with lights lit , or people , or billboards , or bicyclists or cars , or even cattle in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an indication of there being people about , but simply as a sign of the absence of people . What admit ted this possibility , he decided , was the stop sign at the crossing : that is to say , a remnant of civilization but not something presently detaining any cars-something that was once functional as a warning ( after all , the painting was titled CASMALIA STOP ) ; but now a dead word-STOP-barely discernible in the sign in the painting , was little more than a symptom of past time . Was there not , in fact , a certain cold irony in STOP , inasmuch as there was nothing to stop ? Stop what ? Do not enter ? To whom was it addressed ? <p> In short , if one could imagine it , down the road leading off the right frame there would be more of the same peopleless , houseless road , lined only by telephone poles identical to those in the painting . Oh , perhaps there might be , he speculated , a gas station somewhere down the line . But if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas station , one whose sides had long fallen out of the perpendicular , overgrown by weeds and bushes oozing up through heaving asphalt , precisely as the crossing in the painting was fringed by dark red and sienna shapes identifiable as bushes only because one knew bushes grew on the ground in such places . In other words , it would be a gas station of the past , as if this were a post-human time when everything left there by people had fallen to disrepair and what remained was the phantom of a building on the phantom of a road . <p> Very good , he mused . But where does the road end ? All roads lead somewhere : where would this one finally come to a STOP ( he chuckled ) or join other larger or more industrious roads ? Why of course-the sea ! The painting was based on an actual tree at a crossroads , the photo they took showed that much , and the town through which it ran-ignored completely by Brahmwas located near the water . Does the road , then , lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plausible conclusion . It led to the shore . So he closed his eyes and allowed the painting 's spirit to make another painting depicting the end to which this road led . And shortly , after several failures , owing to lapses of concentration , he envisioned a small parking lot , surrounded by a low metal fence and on the near side a copse of eucalyptus trees , offspring clearly of the tree in the painting . On the seaward side , there was a flat beach which ran in either direction until it disappeared in the dusk or early morning fog . Straight ahead , of course , was the sea , a slate gray singularity gradually shading off into nothingness , like the mist in the cobalt sky of the painting . So this was the end . This is what the painting told him , or not so much told him as insinuated . But the strange thing was that the scene of the parking lot at the beach , which he had only imagined , was as vivid as the painting on the wall before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he wondered how this could possibly occur . How could he see something that was n't there ? How was it that a painting could spawn its own world ? <p> He wondered if he had fallen into a kind of dream ; for the shoreline , and the impenetrable gray sea-mist , struck him as somehow being aware that he was there . All dream images belong to the dreamer in this intimate way , not as the real world belongs to itself but as one 's hand belongs to one 's body . Is not the world of dreams nothing but a projection of the self ? But it really was n't a dream because he was awake . Still , quite clearly he had achieved a rare state of mind . The painting had provoked him to conjure a world that was much more palpable , and far more self-sustaining , than the world of his daydreams . There , before him , was the parking lot , surviving all his thoughts about it , there was the beach and the gray expanse ; and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , perplexed in the extreme by what was taking place . <p> But , he thought , he had better get back . He had forgotten the time , and he had to pick up Connie at the airport at seven in the morning . So before he got even more disoriented , he turned and started back up the road and all seemed to be going well . He decided on one further indulgence , however : on his way back to the crossing , he would stop off at the gas station he had passed on his way down . And after walking a hundred yards or so he saw it ahead , now on the left side of the road , nestled back at the edge of a group of palms and oak trees . It was a stark , astonishing building , a sort of one-room schoolhouse , though not at all large enough to be a schoolhouse , with a pitched roof and a turret of some sort in the front , that rose , apparently purposeless , like a belfry . It was shaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ever seen . There was a wide bay window in the front and smaller , house-sized windows running around the sides and back , most of them sealed by plywood sheets nailed to the frame . The asphalt fronting the building was badly decomposed , invaded by crab grass and sage , and the concrete slab on which the pumps once stood-now long gone-was virtually the only sign that there had ever been a business here . <p> He walked around the back of the building , knee-deep in russet grass . About a hundred feet away , in front of a thick copse of oaks , he saw the remnants of a low spiked iron fence , the sort one finds around country cemeteries . It enclosed , on two sides at least ( the rest of the fence was buried in the grass ) , an area about the size of a large closet . It was apparently an old family plot , but the only evidence of a graveyard was a thin greenstained slab of marble that had toppled over into the grass . The name of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stone , and all that remained in the way of an epitaph was the raised bubble shape-the usual Tree of Life , he supposedunder which he could make out the words " in extremis " and part of an inscription of which only a few letters remained , " chim . . . weepers . " Ah , he smiled , recognizing it as a quote from Shakespeare 's Fidele , a poem he himself had chosen for his mother 's memorial service years ago . <p> Fear no more the heat o ' the sun , Nor the furious winter 's rages : Thou thy worldly task hast done , Home art gone , and ta'en thy wages : Golden lads and girls all must , As chimney sweepers come to dust . <p> He went cold , as if a needle had been inserted in his chest . With a shudder he turned away , overcome by the same solitude he had experienced when he first saw the painting . He felt alone , abandoned . He was reminded of the times he had hitchhiked home from college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pennsylvania roads waiting , sometimes for more than an hour , for a benevolent car to appear . He had always feared that none would arrive , that he would never get off the road . <p> All at once , he saw two dim lights approaching from the direction of the crossing on up the road . He moved back into the shadows of the building . In front of the station the car slowed down , and he seemed to hear singing of some sort coming from inside the car . So there were people after all ! Who was out driving at this hour ? Where had it come from ? The car pulled into the station lot , a squarish four-door sedan from the fifties with extended metal bumpers that reminded him of the car he and some friends had driven to Canada on a weeklong camping trip after his graduation . It pulled up to the concrete platform , as if to purchase gas . But nothing happened , no one got out and there was no sound of a motor running . The singing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it and looked in the front window , but he saw no one inside , whether because it was too dark or because the window was so filthy he could n't say . <p> " This is ridiculous , " he thought . " I 've had enough of this . " But no sooner was the thought out than the car moved on , out the other side of the lot toward the beach from which he had just come . <p> So he started up the road on foot and walked for what seemed like an hour . Then just ahead he saw the single mailbox he had passed on his way down , remembering it only because it seemed so purposeless jutting out to the road on a curved pipe , no house behind it , no side road leading off to a possible ranch . At any rate , he recalled it as being some distance from the crossing and , feeling depressed at his slow progress , he quickened his step . It was an absolutely noiseless night and his feet made no sound on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreaming all this , " he said to himself . But he was still not satisfied that this was the right explanation . The truth is , he wanted it to be a dream ; he craved the assurance that sleep was causing these strange events to occur and that he would awake with a start and resume his life . But at the back of his mind a suspicion was accumulating that though this had all of the characteristics of a dream it was something very different . <p> Behind him , he became aware of the car approaching . Wherever it had been , it was coming back . He moved off to the side of the road and when the car got abreast of him it stopped . " This is the same ' 52 Plymouth we took to Canada , " he thought . He approached it , leaned forward and tapped on the front window . Then the window was rolled down . He peered inside but he could see nothing . Then out of the darkness he saw the outline of a face and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never seen . The face was smooth and ashen , sleek , like the road itself , and the chin was hidden by a small grizzled beard the color of the tree in the painting . The face looked at him , without expression . <p> " Would you give me a lift ? " he asked . But the window was slowly closing , as if on its own power . " Wait ! " he cried . " I 'll pay you ! " <p> Astonished , he moved back a pace as the car started forward . " Help me ! " he cried . <p> But the car continued on up the road , gathering speed . And then he heard the singing again ; it was a chorus of drunken boys singing at the top of their lungs a song he knew so well : <p> Viva la , viva la , viva l'amour Viva l'amour , viva l'amour Viva la , viva la , viva l'amour Viva la compan-y ! <p> And as the small red tail-lights disappeared over the crest of the road , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of me ? " he thought , and the words had no sooner left his mouth than he imagined that he was lying on the starched sheets of a bed , barely conscious of soft voices around him , things touching him , comforting things being said to him . " There , that 's better , " a voice said , at once alien and familiar , and his brow was being soothed by a cool compress . But the tone of the voice and the softness of the touch were those of resignation , as if they-whoever they were-had already given him up and were merely easing him to his peace . Then the bed was gone and he was standing on the road again . He looked into the sky where a few stars had appeared . And suddenly , the night , alive with loneliness , exploded in the sustained crash of a great chord , as if a broom had been swept across the sky . As it faded away in an echo of brass , he sank to his knees on the road . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The soft light of morning filtered through the front window and outside on the patio the fountain burbled musically . Then a car drove up before the house and stopped . Presently words : Connie saying " Thank you , " the car door closing , the car driving off , her steps approaching the door . She opened the door , put down her suitcase , and saw him in the chair . <p> " Where were you ? " she said , more in shock than irritation . <p> " You were to pick me up . I had to get a cab . " Then , astonished , she came up to him and shook his shoulder lightly , without response . <p> Then in a blaze of understanding , she saw that he was not asleep . <p> At midnight he looked at his watch and realized that he had been writing for over five hours and that he had better get some sleep . His shirt was wet with perspiration and he felt dazed but strangely exhilarated . He thought of the extraordinary chain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , all recorded there in his tablet . He felt like a survivor of a catastrophe . But suddenly a premonition began to rise in his mind . It grew steadily and then drained into his entire body in a cold realization : what had happened to him , wherever he had been , was only the prelude to an experience that would come again , that what was down the road was still down the road , and this is what the painting was all about ; this was its truth : something to be endured again on a future day much like this one , not as a fiction from which he would awake but as the inevitable fruit of his days . <p> In memory of Bjorn Rye <p>
