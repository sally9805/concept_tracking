Fishmongers , rejoice . If the U.S. Roman Catholic bishops have their way , the eating of fish on Fridays may once again become a habit for American Catholics . When the hierarchy meets this week in Washington , it is likely to approve a one-year study on how to revive the old penitential practice of abstaining from meat each Friday . The bishops ' pro-life committee wants the dietary regimen to serve as a silent protest against the " culture of death , " especially legalized abortion and euthanasia . No meat on Fridays was long a strict church rule , observed by millions " under pain of sin . " But in 1966 , after the Second Vatican Council liberalized many other practices , POPE PAUL VI permitted bishops in each country to set their own dietary practices . But now Friday may once again mean fish fingers . <P>  --  By Richard N. Ostling/New York
