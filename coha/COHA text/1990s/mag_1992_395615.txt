Sixteen years after my father 's death I can still feel the heaviness of his large hands in mine and hear the echoes of his raucous laughter . I am a daddy 's girl . Always will be . The time a daughter spends with her father  --  whether it is confined to three months in a long , torturous year or over scrambled eggs every morning  --  is not just precious , it is essential . If he is righteous , a father helps to mold a young girl 's soul into the spirit of a woman . If he misuses his power , he can tear her heart to shreds , wounding her in places that may take years to heal . Society has long deemed the father-son relationship a pivotal one for ensuring positive development of the young male , while assigning the mother the major responsibility for shaping a daughter . Now experts have begun to realize that fathers play a key role in shaping their daughters ' lives , and that women have something to give their dads as well . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter and offers positive mental health and self-esteem to the father , " says Frederick B. Phillips , Ph.D. , founder of the Progressive Life Center in Washington , D.C. , which offers an array of psychological services . " Within the framework of this relationship , the daughter has the opportunity to develop her womanliness , as contrasted with male energy . She can test out her female energy in a safe , nonsexual relationship . Fathers can realize stronger and truer self-esteem by receiving pure love , not to be confused with sexuality . " If " the good mother " by society 's standards is a straitjacket of confining expectations , society is equally strict about the characteristics of " the good father . " " We are brought up to expect that a father should provide income , food and clothing , " says Gail Wyatt , Ph.D. , a psychologist who is a professor at the Neuropsychiatricte at the University of California , Los Angeles , and who specializes in male-female relationships in her private practice . But some of us have fathers who have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joy . There is more to fathering than a checkbook , and Wyatt cautions us against accepting a rigid definition that so often serves to distance fathers from their offspring . " There are men who lack the income to support their children , but they can sit down and talk to their daughters , " she says . " And a father is n't just one who provides basic needs . The best fathers reinforce the idea that their girl 's femaleness is charming and positive , that things about her as a female are special . " Dana Marie Jordan , 23 , a graduate student at the College of William and Mary in Virginia , grew up in a two-parent home feeling cherished by both her mother and father . But her dad 's love has had a special impact . " All my life my father has told me that I look nice , that I 'm pretty , " she says . " And when I really dress up to go ou , he starts whistling . He tells me , " That 's my beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she has received from her faher has helped her to like the person she sees in the mirror . She has been equally supported by her mother . What her father has given her that her mother ca n't is the sense that she can negotiate with the opposite sex . " He 's been like a brother to me in some ways , " she says . " He 's taught me about football , cars and a lot of things that society says women ca n't learn . Whatever I wat to know about men I ca ask him . If some guy I like says something or does something that I do n't understand , I ca hae my father interpret his behavior . " There is no school for fathering . Those who do it well  --  that is , lovingly  --  seem to have the instinct and the heart . Perhaps they have learned how to father from their own fathers , either by attempting to emulate a positive example or by veering away from anegative one . Mostly , like Dana 's dad , these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they love their daughters " If my dad had n't been there for me , I know that I would n't be as self-confident as I am , " says Robyn Greer , a 22-year-old hairstylist from Pittsburgh . Although her parents were divorced when she was young , she has never felt deprived of a father . " He always encouraged me and told me to do my best . Whatever I 've wanted to do , he has supported me . If something important is going on in my life , he is always there . " He has also been protective of her in the infuriatingly meddlesome way only fathers can . " Boys were always intimidated by my dad , " says Robyn , who spent part of her childhood living with her father ad her stepmother . " He would make guys take off their hats when they came into our house . If a guy blew his car horn for me , Daddy would go outside , open the car door and say , " Boy , did your people raise you to blow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She adds , " When I was a teenager , I thought my father was overly protective and way too strict . Back then I was angry with him . Now I 'm not . " Now , as a young adult , Robyn realizes that her father 's gruff behavior sent out a necessary warning to her prospective suitors : " Respect my daughter or deal with me . " She knows it is daddyspeak for " I love you . " As important as a daughter 's need for a father 's love in a society that far too often circumscribes women 's ambitions is her need for male respect and validation of her intellect . Although African-American women have always worked , men are the ones who have " been in the world " in ways that , until very recently , few women were . When girls receive the message from their fathers that they can do or be anything , it is especially significant and propels them forward . " My father is the reason I became a reporter , " says Gayle Pollard Terry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Los Angeles Times . Her parents have been married for more than 48 years , and throughout their childhood her father encouraged her and her siblings to excel academically . " I graduated from high school in 1968 , a few months after Dr. King was killed . I planned to go to college and become a teacher like my mom . The night before I began my sophomore year , my father was on a plane and he sat next to a white journalist who told him that newspapers around the country were looking for Black reporters . My father called me up the next day and asked , " Do you know what journalism is ? ' When I told him I did , he said , " Tomorrow I want you to sign up for a journalism class . ' He helped shape my entire future . " Lydia Kennard , 37 , is an attorney and urban planner in Los Angeles whose own firm , KDG Developments , is housed in the some building as her father 's company , KDG Architecture . She remembers spending time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Because Dad always encouraged me , I never had a fear of stepping out . When I wanted to run for president of my high school class , when I was thinking about law school , he always said , " Try it . You can do it . " " Lydia adds , " I have no fear of being equal to men . " Psychologist Wyatt comments , " When a father praises his daughter for her strengths and exposes her to the working world , it says to the daughter that a man sees her as a peer , as capable . That kind of approval from a father is very important for a girl . " THE WOUNDED DAUGHTER The wise , loving father , a la Heathcliff Huxtable , is what we all need . But sometimes a father 's participation in a daughter 's life is insidious and wounding and far too often he is n't even there . Half of all American children today will reach age 18 without having lived continuously with both biological parents , according to a 1981 study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Institutes of Mental Health . Children are always left to grapple with the devastation and loneliness that follow when fathers weave in and out of their lives . The prevailing attitude is that daughters are more adept at coping with divorce than their brothers , that somehow they suffer less . But although females may appear to fare better than males during childhood , Judith S. Wallerstein , Ph.D. , coauthor of Second Chances : Men , Women and Children a Decade After Divorce , a longitudinal study of the impact of divorce on families , declares that girls ' reaction to divorce is often sublimated during childhood , only to emerge when they become women . " Roughly between the ages of 19 and 23 , when girls begin to think seriously about committing themselves to a man , many seem to reconnect with the pain of their father 's leaving , " says Wallerstein . " At that point , the girl 's fear of failure between men and women begins to emerge . " The result is that many of these young women distrust men , fearing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are , of course , other violations even more catastrophic than a father 's absence . Physical and emotional abuse and incest leave indelible scars on little girls ' hearts . June Livingston ( this and all following names are pseudonyms ) , 39 , a teacher in Los Angeles , first remembers her father severely beating her when she was 4 years old ; she thinks she may have blocked out earlier abuse . " My father was an alcoholic who drank every day , " June says . " He was in the Marine Corps , and when he got drunk he became the kind of macho man that that organization extols . One night my mom , my dad and I went to visit one of my father 's sisters . My mother and father were playing cards and my father was drunk . When he lost the game , he began hitting my mother and throwing the cards off the table . When my uncle finally managed to push him away , my father ran into the room where I was . He snatched me up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and began kicking me in the stomach . After he stopped , I managed to open the door , and my aunt pulled me out of the car . " June limped through her childhood , holding her head down , hoping nobody would see her blackened eyes and swollen lips . She always seemed to be bleeding ; today the bruises remain in her psyche . Years of therapy have assisted her in her struggle to become whole , but she still feels trepidation about relating to a man . " My childhood made me afraid of being in a relationship . Then when I finally began to date , I catered to men . A guy would take me to a dance and put me in a seat , and I 'd stay there the entire night until he came to get me . I was terrified of male anger . " June has been celibate for ten years but confesses that she 'd like to marry . " But I do n't want to lose myself totally in a relationship , " she says . " My mom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship leads to a fracturing of the psyche for both people , " says Phillips . " Both go to great lengths to repress that violation , but in deeper terms they become less than whole as they carry the violation around . " Phillips believes that both physically and sexually abused women exhibit symptoms of their abuse . June 's reticence in forming relationships out of fear of male aggression is a reasonable response from a woman who has been battered . He says that women who have been molested by their fathers have specific pain and anger that play out in different ways . On one end of the spectrum , some abused women may enter the sex industry , becoming prostitutes and porn stars who act out the devaluation they have been taught to feel about their bodies ; in the process they turn sex into a power relationship in which they feel they have control . At the other end are abused women who seem to behave normally but who carry their anger , hurt and mistrust into relationships with other men . According to Phillips , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abuse , need psychological counseling to move beyond the pain of their traumatized girlhoods . FATHERS WHO DISAPPEAR Coming to terms with not having gotten the love and attention they needed from " now you see him , now you do n't " fathers often is n't any less complicated for daughters than recovering from abusive dads . Wyatt believes that the rising wave of teenage pregnancy could be partly a result of girls needing to fill a void created by absentee fathers or be the result of never having had a positive relationship with a male . The lack of information that is usually gained through relationships between fathers and daughters can sometimes result in adolescents using the wrong criteria in choosing their peers , which can result in unintended sexual activity or adolescent pregnancy . Sandra Cox , 38 , was n't a teenager when she gave birth to her daughter in 1977 , but she now recognizes that in choosing to be with her child 's father she was replicating the unsatisfactory father-daughter relationship of her childhood and attempting to work out those old problems in a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my life when I was a girl , and I had a lot of anger about that , " she says . " When I met my daughter 's father , a man who was 12 years older than I , I think I was looking for a father figure . I looked to him for guidance and asked him what I should do with my life . The problem was , he was as irresponsible as my own father . He got involved with drugs , and since I left him he has had no contact with our daughter . " " Adults who were abandoned as children must learn to live with the loss of a parent as though he has died . They need to fill the need for a father through contact with other important males , such as uncles , grandfathers or other family members or friends , " says Wyatt . Depression , low self-esteem and problematic relationships with men are often the residue of a father 's desertion . Experts agree that daughters must attempt to release these painful symptoms . It 's realistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hold on to their pain . The pain , however , should be taken seriously , according to Wallerstein . She urges women to get an accurate story of their parents ' breakup in order to begin to heal themselves . " Daughters often feel they were to blame for divorce . Getting a true picture may help them realize that their father 's leaving had nothing to do with them , " says the psychologist , who also advises that daughters seek counseling . " Individual or group therapy can help women work through issues . " Wyatt suggests that daughters of divorce can support one another in groups that do n't just describe problems , but rather probe for solutions . The therapist is cautious about advising women to confront their absentee fathers , saying , " Confrontation is sometimes therapeutic , but you have to know the man . If he 's basically concerned and will listen , he may be a good candidate . Daughters should n't expect anything to change . Basically , expressing pent-up feelings face-to-face benefits daughters , not fathers . " Confrontation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington , D.C. , meant coming to grips with the forces that shaped her father and made him such a disturbingly inconsistent presence in her life . Although Darlene and her sister have happy memories of spending time with their father after their parents ' divorce , his harsh criticism of her during her childhood was painful , and throughout her teens and twenties they rarely spoke . When a short-lived second marriage ended in divorce , as had her first , Darlene was forced to look at dysfunctional patterns in her life . She opted to get back in touch with her father and her own internal wounds . At a family reunion in 1986 , she listened as her father talked for six hours about his harsh years growing up in Mississippi . " As I started listening to him talk , I began to see that emotionally he was 12 years old . I 'd been looking for approval from a man who did n't love himself , " she says . After several attempts at reconciliation , Darlene has abandoned hope of ever having a relationship with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned how to nurture me as a woman , and that for my own self-protection I have to stay away , " she says . But she has n't given up hope of having a kind of father-daughter relationship . " I 've adopted an older cousin as a father . He and I call each other and talk often . When I turned 40 , he and his wife came to my party and he barbecued all the ribs for me . He 's the daddy I wish I had , " she says . Phillips agrees that if Darlene has expressed a true range of emotions and not received what she needs from her father , it is time for her to move on . He says that many absentee fathers have n't been taught how to get in touch with the expression of their softer side and feel uncomfortable with tender feelings . For those women who are still trying to negotiate a relationship with the father who was absent during their childhood , he advises direct communication . " Women need to be direct and clear about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fathers , either face-to-face , through the telephone or in a letter , " he says . " To communicate effectively , women should n't attack or put the man on the defensive . Instead they should try to connect and form a bond . Start off by saying " We share a lot . I know you 've been hurt about our relationship . ' Provide the father an opportunity to express his pain . " Any biologically capable male can father a child , but it takes commitment to see the job through . If a girl has a good daddy , she knows he is on her side , just as much as he is on her case . He is hands-on , and those hands do n't let go . Not ever . When the father-daughter relationship is positive , it 's like a perfect boost  --  the helping hand a woman needs to get over . When that critical relationship is impaired , a sister has to hoist herself up and push herself over . She has to love herself back to health . Locked safely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself the victim of an unexpected and unrelenting fear : I had a deep-seated dread that the lover-best friend-brother who I had quite sanely fallen in love with over the last six months would close the door of my apartment and never return . There was no logical reason for this : There had been no rupture . Our temporary parting was a necessary reprieve from our four-day reverie of quasi-connubial bliss . In other words , we both understand that the love thing is nice , but in order to remain healthy , happy and whole , we both have to function in the real world . So I tried very hard to squelch the growing ache in my chest , look this lover-best friend-brother straight in the eye and convince him he was leaving behind a womanist tower of power . Not quite . " Joan , is something wrong ? " he asked , pulling me tighter . " You look frightened ... just like a little girl . " And then I understood . My fear had nothing to do with my adult woman-self  --  the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and woman 's space , the one who longs to smell her own scent on her sheets , pour tea with her sisters and let the sounds of girlfriend laughter replenish the house . This fear was all about a little girl , the displaced daddy 's girl that surfaces every so often in my intimate relationships with men . From the ages of 4 to 7 , I cried inconsolably each time my father left the house . No one knew quite what to make of this . I was too young to understand the dangers that lurked outside our South Bronx apartment , and because my father did not keep odd , inexplicable hours , my tantrums were dismissed as the unbridled passions of first love . The origins of this separation anxiety remained a mystery until yearswhen I was 21 and trying to deal with my father 's final departure from our home . In many ways my father 's decision to return to his native Jamaica was one that as an adult I both understood and respected . My parents ' relationship had fallen upon tempestuous times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how they both viewed the world . Returning to Jamaica was more than my father 's means of spiritual salvation ; it would also give him and my mother the distance necessary to close a painful chasm . But hell hath no fury like a woman scorned . The little girl in me was experiencing a deep sense of anger and betrayal toward this man who was supposed to love me unconditionally . Ever since I could remember , my parents ' arguments had been punctuated by my father 's threats to leave and " go back home . " I spent my childhood and adolescence trying to circumvent that by being the quintessential daddy 's girl . I saved all acts of rebellion and acting out for my mother and continued to worship my father  --  the elusive , illusory figure I 'd created with arduous devotion . I walked away from that experience with a painful lesson . I 'd grown up fearing that the man I loved most in the world would one day up and step . As a result , I 'd written a protective " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  irrespective of past promises , irrespective of how perfect a man was or tried to be , because the men whom you love or who are supposed to love you most are capable of jumping ship for reasons that have little or nothing to do with you . Hence the frightened little girl shivering on the stairs . Daddy 's girls are susceptible to patterns . My childhood fear of male abandonment became a self-fulfilling prophecy in my romantic relationships . As long as I held on to the anger I was feeling toward my father , the disgruntled daddy 's girl chose my men for me . And because I was a Lolita with a mad Electra complex , it meant ending up with men who were just like my father : incredibly fine , artistic , passionate , charming  --  souls with occasional hints of genius and serious problems with accountability and commitment . It took a few years and plenty of emotional bruises before I realized that my adult needs would never be fulfilled until I let go of the anger . I 'm no longer looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accept him for the absolutely wonderful but humanly imperfect man he is . Sometimes in my house ( and occasionally on the street ) , it looks as if I 'm talking to myself . Mostly I ; m talking to my unborn women children ; making surreptitious pacts with them helps to nullify the debilitating , infuriating potency of a simole little phrase like " just the way men are . " I promise them that they ( and I ) will never settle for " just the way men are . " They will know what a good man should be . Then I say a silent prayer to whatever goddess will listen : Teach this frightened girl to accept strong , loving Black arms . Let the unborn women children learn  --  not from the pain of absence but through example .
