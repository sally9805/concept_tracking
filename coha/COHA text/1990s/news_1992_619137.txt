<p> After 11 years as San Francisco 's planning czar , Dean Macris will retire March 27 , ending an era in which he ushered in a wall- to-wall procession of skyscrapers and then took charge of a public revolt to impose the most radically restrictive highrise controls in the nation . <p> Macris , who announced his retirement last month , is widely regarded as the most powerful planning director in the city 's history and an indispensable aide to three mayors until Mayor Frank Jordan signaled for a change . <p> Nationally , Macris has won praise for the city 's highrise controls , which force developers to pay for public art , child care and parks . His department also took over much of the planning for the 313-acre Mission Bay project along the southern waterfront instead of letting the builders call all the shots . <p> But Macris has drawn criticism . Slow-growth advocates claim he let development run wild for years ; builders say their trade has been chained down . Families who tried to remodel their homes complain of delays caused by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see as repression of innovative design through rules that call for Victorian look-alikes and towers with fashionably tapered rooflines . <p> DIFFICULT JOB <p> Everyone agrees that Macris has held a tough job . In a city as crowded and polarized as San Francisco , it would be impossible for any director to satisfy everyone  --  the mayor , the Board of Supervisors , the Planning Commission , neighborhood groups and downtown interests . <p> " When you come across the Bay Bridge and look at the array of buildings , it is a powerful and stimulating sight , " said John Jacobs , former president of the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce . " Dean has done as well as any planning director can do . That does n't mean that I 've always agreed with him . " <p> Macris says he has assumed the role of civic guardian when it came to " public acts " of development , and he notes that San Francisco has the most extensive environmental review process in the state  --  because the public demands it . <p> " I 've been doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public realm , and I like to think I 've done it with integrity and some finesse , " he said . Now he is considering several possibilities for the future : writing , teaching , lecturing , and consulting for major planning projects around the country . <p> Macris began his career at the Chicago planning department , where he worked 10 years . In 1975 , he became San Francisco 's planning czar under Mayor Joseph Alioto for a year before joining the Association of Bay Area Governments . <p> Mayor Dianne Feinstein reappointed him to the top planning post in 1981 , in the thick of San Francisco 's building boom . The crisis then was a shortage of offices as businesses clamored to expand , and Macris and Feinstein readily accommodated their needs . But the boom stoked the fires of an anti-growth movement , which had been galvanized by the tall , boxy towers that started springing up in the late 1960s . <p> By the mid-1980s , a public revolt forced San Francisco to adopt the strictest development controls in the nation with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initiative that voters narrowly approved in 1986 . <p> Despite this , between 1981 and 1991 , planners approved an astounding 18.5 million square feet of offices , increasing total downtown office space by a third . More than 16,800 housing units and 7,231 hotel rooms were built in the same time . <p> TWO PICTURES <p> Depending on whom one talks to , the embattled director is described as either a cunningly devilish dealmaker or a fair , good-humored official skilled at building consensus . <p> " Dean is the most clever and Machiavellian person I know , " said one developer , who asked not to be named . " And he 's also the most charming and tough person I know . . . . He certainly is not what he seems on the surface . " <p> Under Macris , politics , not merit , ultimately decided whether a project got approved , said Tim Tosta , a development attorney . As a result , doing business in San Francisco became regarded as an unreliable process  --  a perception that has deeply damaged the city 's reputation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , many believe Macris took on powers beyond his jurisdiction , said Dick Robinson , a senior director at Cushman &; Wakefield Western Inc. , a property broker . " Many of these controls he initiated were put into place because he alone felt they were necessary , " Robinson said . <p> Anti-growth activists said Macris dictated development deals . <p> " Dean was a hardball player , " said affordable housing advocate Calvin Welch , who dubbed Macris ' department the " Office of Building Approvals . " " He did whatever it took to get a project approved . " <p> POLITICAL EDGE <p> All sides agree , however , that Macris was a smooth political operator . Some question whether anyone else could have done better at a job that demands political cleverness , administrative skills and planning vision . <p> Wayne Jackson Hu , the outgoing president of the planning commission , faults the director for focusing on short-term preservationist demands rather than long-term plans factoring in the city 's economic health . " I do n't know if Dean is the greatest planner in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Macris has been the best overall at managing all three aspects of the job . Nationally , urban planners say San Francisco 's growth controls may have saved the city from development excesses of the 1980s . <p> " The number of things he ( Macris ) has done has captured the attention nationally of planners across the country , " said Israel Stollman , executive director of the American Planning Association , which heaped awards on San Francisco city planners for the downtown plan and the Mission Bay plan . <p> Regarded as an urban planning hallmark , the downtown plan down-scaled the height and bulk of new towers and directed office growth south of Market Street . It also made San Francisco first in the nation to make builders pay fees for low-cost housing , transit improvements , child care , open space and public art . <p> MISSION BAY SUCCESS <p> Macris also saved the Mission Bay project from resembling another downtown by persuading its private developer to let his staff draft its layout . The result was a model for planners worldwide . Other achievements include rezonings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; brought housing to industrial zones like Rincon Hill and Van Ness Avenue ; and preserved low-cost rentals in the Tenderloin and Chinatown . <p> " Dean is a real star . He is an incredibly visionary planner , " said Homer Russell , assistant director of the Boston Redevelopment Authority . " . . . I think a lot of his work influenced Boston . " <p> Locally , however , planning observers regard Macris as a political barometer rather than a visionary . " Dean Macris served the interests of his boss , " said Buck Bagot , president of the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency commission . " Under Feinstein , he was totally willing to line the city wall-to-wall with highrises . But under Agnos and under Proposition M , he was n't able to do that . " <p> " If Dean Macris had done such a terrific job , why was Proposition M passed ? " said lawyer Sue Hestor , who headed the anti-highrise San Franciscans for Reasonable Growth in the early ' 80s . Proposition M currently limits yearly office growth to 475,000 new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty contest . " <p> The downtown plan , which was ordered up by Feinstein to head voters off from passing a strict slow-growth measure , included innovative ideas from the grass-roots movement of Hestor and Welch . <p> Macris was politically savvy enough to adopt progressive ideas and turn them to his advantage , Hestor said . " He could turn what the community demanded into something that gave him power , " she said . " That 's the definition of an opportunist . " <p> VICTORIAN MOLD <p> Other criticisms of Macris include complaints from architects that new buildings are frozen into a bland Victorian mold  --  a trend they blame on growing neighborhood control over design . Responding to public demand , the Planning Commission has increasingly used its power of " discretionary review " to reject projects . <p> Architects also say the design rules and the competition for building permits under the yearly allotments have led architects to suggest tamely designed buildings . No developer wants to take a chance , the critics say . <p> " In a way , San Francisco is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the essentials of postmodernism , " said Scott Johnson of Johnson , Fain &; Pereira Associates , the Los Angeles firm that designed the Transamerica Building and Rincon Center . " It 's fairly common discussion to hear that the civic architecture in San Francisco is very mediocre . " <p> Others disagree , noting that postmodernism is popular across the country . Still others say buildings can still be daring while blending in and preserving such pedestrian comforts as sunlight .
