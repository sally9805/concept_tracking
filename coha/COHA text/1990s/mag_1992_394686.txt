After a long winter that provided few good views of Saturn , the ringed planet returns to prominence this month . Still in Capricornus and fairly low in the southeast before , dawn , Saturn is a fascinating object for two reasons . First , Saturn 's rings reach their minimum tilt for the year in late May  --  a little less than 15deg . The rings were at their minimum tilt in 1988 , when they were inclined 27deg with respect to Earth . But now that angle is decreasing to the point that the rings will appear edge-on in 1995 , as they were in 1980 . The rings appear edge-on whenever Earth 's orbit intersects the plane of Saturn 's ring system , which itself is inclined 27deg to the plane of that planet 's orbit . The edgewise appearance occurs at intervals of 13.75 years and 15.75 years during Saturn 's 29.5-year orbit . The unequal periods result from the planet 's changing velocity as it travels along its elliptical orbit . During the 13.75-year period , we see the planet 's southern hemisphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pole is tilted toward Earth ( as it is now ) . A second good reason to check out Saturn now is that it , Earth , and the Sun make a right angle in space  --  an alignment known as quadrature . At this configuration , you can easily see Saturn 's inky shadow as it fails dramatically across the rings behind and to one side of the disk . In May , we are looking at the planet approximately three months before opposition , so we see narrow , angular shadow cast west of the disk . As Saturn moves toward opposition on August 7 , the shadow dwindles , only to reappear on the east side of the disk in the months following opposition . Because of this shadow play , no other planet possesses quite the three-dimensional quality Saturn does . There 's one more good reason to begin observing Saturn in earnest now . Since 1986 , Saturn has been skimming along the southern part of the ecliptic , never venturing north of - 19deg declination . So the planet has n't been very well-placed for observers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saturn makes some real progress to the north , creeping up to - 16deg declination in May . This northward movement puts Saturn in the sky for northern observers , which should translate into slightly steadier telescopic images . You can test this by looking for Saturn 's bright satellites ( not counting Titan , which is always easy to see ) . If the sky is free of haze , a 60mm telescope should pull in 9.7-magnitude Rhea , but you will need a larger aperture to glimpse Tethys ( magnitude 10.2 ) and Dione ( 10.4 ) . A 5-inch or larger scope under good observing conditions will show these three as glints of light hovering near Saturn 's disk like fireflies around a lantern . WHAT 'S JUPITER ANGLE ? Jupiter reigns high in the southwest after sunset this month and , as it so happens , is well-placed not only for the telescope but in solar system as well . As I 've often stated , Jupiter never fails to please . But now , three months past opposition , the planet exhibits an appealing shadow show that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Saturn earlier in the month , reaches quadrature . This has two effects : First , Jupiter displays its greatest phase angle , the greater the fraction of the planet 's visible hemisphere that appears dark . Mars ' maximum phase angle , for example , is 47deg , while Jupiter 's is only about 12deg . ( The angle is successively smaller the more distant the planet because Earth appears closer to the Sun . ) So with the exception of Mars , which near quadrature is obviously gibbous , the outer planets show nearly their full phases at all times . Technically speaking , however , Jupiter phase lies somewhere between a generous gibbous and full . Look carefully at Jupiter 's eastern limb and see if it appears a bit softer than the planet 's hard-edged western limb . If it does , you 've seen the phase effect , and you 'll know that your telescope and observing eye are working to near perfection . The second effect of quadrature is more obvious to observers . With the gas giant being lit more from the side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one side of its globe . Thus , when a moon passes into Jupiter 's shadow , from our vantage point it does so farther from the planet 's disk , where it is much easier to view . This month observers in North America can watch Jupiter 's brightest moon , Ganymede , pass into Jupiter 's shadow on the two occasions  --  on the nights of May 10/11 and May 17/18 . On the 10/11th , Ganymede goes into eclipse at 10:21 p.m . EDT and reappears from eclipse at 1:47 a.m . EDT ( 10:47 p.m . PDT ) . Observers in the eastern and central time zones can see both the disappearance and reappearance , while those in the mountain and pacific time zones will miss Ganymede passing into the shadow but will see it come out of the shadow . The eclipse on May 17/18 is not quite as favorable as the event a week earlier . This time , Ganymede disappears into Jupiter 's shadow at 2:20 a.m . EDT ( 11:20 p.m . PDT ) , an event visible from throughout North America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 5:45 a.m . EDT or 2:45 a.m . PDT ) . , which unfortunately is after Jupiter sets . After opposition , Jupiter 's shadow is always cast east of its disk . Ganymede thus appears east of Jupiter at eclipse time and moving away from the planet 's disk . In a Newtonian reflector , which inverts the image , south is up and east is to the right . With catadiotric and refracting telescopes equipped with a star diagonal , view is mirror-reversed . TELESCOPIC PLANETS The two inner planets are essentially lost from view this month for observers at mid-northern latitudes . You might glimpse Mercury on the 1st , when it lies 3deg above the eastern horizon half an hour before sunrise , but count yourself lucky if you can make out its 7.0 " - diameter , 56-percent-lit disk . Venus is even harder to observe , rising in the east just 25 minutes before the Sun . The observing situation improves noticeably , however , for our outer neighbors , Mars . Observers of the Red Planet may recall that in 1988 one or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of powerful wind currents generated by increased solar heat as the planet approached perihelion . This year , Mars comes to perihelion on May 17 , so now is a good time to begin looking for dust storm activity on the planet 's surface . Because Mars has an apparent diameter of only 5 " this month , a global dust storm is about all a person with a small telescope can see right now . With a disk size this small , the best way to judge is a dust orange hue one night but appears bright yellow a week later , you can infer that a major dust storm is in progress . These yellow dust clouds appear even brighter if you use a yellow filter , like a Wratten #12 . Uranus and Neptune rise nearly two hours before Saturn this month and are well-placed for observation after midnight . Uranus glows at magnitude 5.7 and its blue-green disk measures 3.7 " across . Blue-gray Neptune appears even fainter and smaller  --  glowing at magnitude 7.9 and sporting a 2.3 ' ' - diameter disk . You say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? All save Pluto , that is ? Well , you 're in luck . This month you can finally put that last notch in you telescope , right next to the ones for Uranus and Neptune . Tiny Pluto comes to opposition on the night of May 11/12 . It is at this time ( and in the weeks prior to and following this period ) that Pluto is brightest and most favorably positioned for observing , though you 'll still need and 8-inch telescope to spot the 14th-magnitude point of light . For a complete guide on how to find and observe Pluto , see " In Pursuit of Pluto " on page 73 . ASTEROIDS IN THE EYEPIECE Minor planet enthusiasts will want to exploit the moonless nights in early and late May to scan the western realm of Ophichus for the asteroid 532 Herculina . At the beginning of the month , this 150-kilometer-wide chunk of space rack glows dimly at magnitude 9.4 . On that night it lies some 4deg east of Delta and Epsilon Ophiuchi . After opposition , Herculina moves leisurely toward the southwest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the asteroid 's field with the aid of the finder chart or table of coordinates on the opposite page and then make a detailed sketch of the field using an eyepiece with about 1deg true field of view . A few nights later , return to this field and compare the star positions . The " star " that has moved is Herculina . GREAT RED SPOT TRANSIT TIMES DATE  --  TIME May 3  --  1:21 a.m .

IT IS ESPECIALLY SO FOR THE HISPANIC CHILD . THIS OUGHT TO SERVE AS A CLARION CALL FOR TEACHER-LIBRARIANS AND OTHER EDUCATORS WHO ARE CHARGED WITH TEACHING OUR NEXT GENERATION . HOW CAN WE ENCOURAGE YOUNG LATINO READERS , GET THEM INTO OUR LIBRARIES WHERE THE BOOKS ARE , AND MAKE READING A FAMILY AFFAIR ? <p> L : SOUNDING THE ALARM Though seemingly dated and already hashed out countless times by different literacy specialists and members of the media , this is as good a time as any to revisit the National Endowment for the Arts ' ( NEA ) Reading At Risk survey released in 2004 . Poet Dana Gioia , chairman of the NEA from 2002 to January 2009 , ( NEA , 2004 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not a report the National Endowment for the Arts is happy to issue " ( p. vii ) . The report caused many of us in the literacy business to take pause , if not outright stop dead in our tracks . " Has all our work in the classroom over the years been for naught ? " we asked . " How did we fail our students so miserably ? " <p> The more we studied the numbers the more concerned we became . As a teacher and Latino , I was particularly interested in the obvious drop in literary reading among Hispanics between 1982 and 2002 ; there was a nearly 10% decline from 36.4 in 1982 to 26.5 in 2002 ( NEA , 2004 , p. 24 ) . As if this information was n't bleak enough , the NEA more recently published a similar document titled To Read or Not to Read : A Question of National Consequence ( 2007 ) that describes the current situation in starker terms than the previous document . This time Gioia uses the terms " alarming " and " disturbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habits ( p. 3 ) . In other words , the problems of illiteracy and aliteracy do not come to a halt simply because the next survey will not be conducted for another several years . <p> Educators and parents should feel a greater sense of urgency , because the next batch of graduates will be among those represented in the upcoming survey . It is not out of the question to imagine a greater decline in literacy between now and then , and if the trends hold , so much worse for the Hispanic community . <p> L : FAMILIES READING TOGETHER : THE OUNCE OF PREVENTION MISSING Children 's book author and literacy expert Mere Fox ( 2001 ) argues , " Prevention of reading problems happens long before a child starts school . In fact , the first day of school is almost too late for a child to begin to learn to read " ( p. 13 ) . This means that , for a child to be caught up with his peers in reading , he has to have grown up in a print-rich environment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from infancy . Jim Trelease ( 2006 ) , in his now classic text , The Read-Aloud Handbook , calls it the " sponge factor " ( p. xiv ) , and recommends reading " as often as a parent and the child ... have time for , " but to be consistent about it ( p. 75 ) . The child has to have been surrounded by books , newspapers , and magazines ( Krashen , 2004 , p. 57 ) , and he has to have witnessed his family members in the act of reading ( p. 84 ) . All that , just to be on level . <p> According to the findings in To Read or Not to Read ( 2007 ) , " The number of books in a home is a significant predictor of academic achievement " ( p. 9 ) . Fox ( 2001 ) likens this constant exposure to daily literacy in the home to inoculation " against illiteracy " ( p. 14 ) . So it follows that when the simple yet vital act of reading to a child is missing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non- or reluctant reader . <p> This problem of illiteracy is further compounded for the Hispanic child because the likelihood that any of the above is regularly happening in the home , if at all , is slim to none . That is not to say Latino parents do not care for the academic success of their children . Quite the contrary , according to Delgado Gaitan ( 2004 ) in her book Involving Latino Families in Schools : Raising Student Achievement Through Home-School Partnerships : " ... Latino parents do care about their children 's education " ( p. vii ) , though this interest usually manifests itself in different ways than it does with their Anglo counterparts . <p> L : A TEACHER-LIBRARIAN 'S JOB IS NEVER DONE This is a call to teacher-librarians , who come into daily contact with young readers . They are even more concerned for the nonreader , since it is the librarians ' calling , nay , their duty to ensure the books on their shelves circulate , which does not happen if kids , and lots of them , are not checking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ library regularly . A reader , who does not require a helpful nudge in the direction of that perfect book for her , visits this book haven regularly . She is not intimidated by having to face the teacher-librarian in order to check out a book ( which can be a daunting task for the uninitiated ) . However , what about those children who walk past the library and seem not to show interest in books ? Overjoyed as she might feel at the reading successes of her " regulars , " the librarian is equally saddened by the many who do not stop in . <p> The teacher-librarian is also frustrated by " reading improvement " programs she knows are doomed to fail , and fail not in and of themselves , but fail because they fall short of reaching the very students who have already experienced disappointment in their literary lives . Teacher-librarians know these programs are sure to cause more harm than good because , as Richard Pliant asserts as early as 1942 , they " set out merely to raise the reading rate a certain percentage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or to raise reading mileage , or to establish non-regressive eye movements ... or to recognize topic sentences " ( p. 236 ) . <p> A teacher-librarian knows this is not part of her calling . Hers is to provide students the opportunity at reading success , which can not be measured by end-of-the-month reports indicating hikes or dips in reading level . The true indication of improvement is to meet with the would-be reader face-to-face , to interact with him on a regular basis . But , as Shakespeare writes , there 's the rub . If the would-be reader chooses to walk past , what is the teacher-librarian to do ? <p> And when the would-be reader is Latino ( a part of the fastest-growing ethnic group in our nation who is shown in survey after survey to demonstrate little to no interest in reading ) , the teacher-librarian has to think outside the box . She must , as a matter of fact , get rid of the box altogether , and create another way of reaching students . <p> L : IF IT 'S BROKEN , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the creation of a Bilingual Book Club . Teacher-librarians , well versed in outside-the-box undertakings , are the likeliest to make the book club a success . In establishing such clubs that involve both children and their parents , teacher-librarians will provide remedies for two major problems affecting Latino communities nationwide . First , the problem of illiteracy in the children and second , the obvious lack of traditional parental involvement in schools and in their children 's academic lives . If successful , the Bilingual Book Club will increase Latino children 's reading abilities in a far less stringent and threatening atmosphere than the classroom offers , and it will encourage more on-campus participation among parents . <p> It has been shown that Latino parents do not participate in school activities because " their roles fall largely outside the partnership model , " writes Susan Auerbach ( 2007 , p. 251 ) . She defines the more traditional partnership model thus : one that " has been socially constructed to privilege White , middle-class norms and the expectations of educators " ( 252 ) . Finders and Lewis ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't Come to School " write , " The institutional perspective holds that children who do not succeed in school have parents who do not get involved in school activities or support school goals at home " ( 50 ) . They discuss the incorrect though prevailing attitude on low to non-existent parental participation -- the " deficit model " they call it -- whereby " those who need to come , do n't come , " so something must be lacking on their part . If absent parents cared about their children 's academic success , would n't they show up for Open House or Meet the Teacher Night , volunteer to read aloud to kids in class , make copies for over-burdened administrators and teachers , chaperon dances or other similar functions , or bake cupcakes for fundraisers ? They would be there , right ? <p> Not necessarily . As educators , we can not continue to conceive of successful parental involvement in terms of numbers present at school functions or how the school benefits from parents participating . This way of gauging successful parental involvement only perpetuates what Azmitia et al @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between an institution 's desired outcome for such relationships and parents ' " experiences and skills " ( n.p. ) , ignoring altogether the parents ' desired academic outcomes for their own children . This demands a re-envisioning , a re-conceptualization on the parts of educators ( teacher-librarians , classroom teachers , and administrators ) as to what we really want from parents and the roles we must play in this new kind of relationship . <p> L : STUDENTS ARE MY BOSSES As educators , we need to think of ourselves as servants to a greater cause : the students and their literacy success . We are here to serve the student , each and every one , one book at a time if need be , but to serve them in the way or ways we know best . Period . Librarians know books best , and they know their readers best . They know how to get kids to read . They know and love their spaces more than anyone else . So , it only makes sense that librarians take the lead with the Bilingual Book Club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Among those who share in this literacy revenue is the school , certainly , but the institution is not the focal point of such a club . First and foremost , there is the student , whose academic success or opportunity at academic success is fundamental . Then comes the parent group who takes from such interaction several things , among them the language and the knowledge of how to approach literature in the home and what is key to showing understanding in their children 's reading . <p> The community at large also benefits in that children master literacy not in one language alone , but in two . Bilingual speakers are more attractive to potential employers as a result of their language diversification . And of course , schools share in the reward of these clubs because state-mandated test scores will very likely improve when literacy is encouraged at home with as much fervor as it is being stressed at school . <p> L : A PARENT 'S LOVE BY ANY OTHER NAME ... It is true : a large majority of Latino parents do not attend school functions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meetings , extra-curricular activities , or sporting events . They are absent for a variety of reasons , but the most obvious is the language barrier their English-speaking skills are either weak or non-existent and they do not know the very private language of the education system . They do not show up either because they fully entrust educators to take care of their children 's educational lives . Teachers are the ones , after all , who have invested the years into earning degrees and are the experts , and so parents understand this to mean teachers will do their part . The reasons are endless . But , as Delgado Gaitan ( 1992 ) emphatically states , Latino parents do care about their children 's success in schools ( p. 500 ) . Their interest simply manifests itself in ways unfamiliar to educators . <p> For example , though my father rarely attended school events , he instilled in us the need to excel in life , including in school . He made it very clear he did not want the same physical labor for his children as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insist that chores are completed before homework , while others will discipline children who get notes sent home indicating a lack of progress or misbehavior in the classroom . " Latino parents already value school ; " says Delgado Gaitain ( 2004 ) , and so this is " a critical advantage for educators to acknowledge and use as a springboard " ( p. 7 ) toward true communication between parents and schools . In addition , this true communication " must be ongoing and remain consistent to the mission of ensuring academic success of Latino students " ( p. 23 ) . <p> L : BOOK CLUB NUTS AND BOLTS Let us explore , in terms you can adapt to fit your individual needs , how to set up your own Bilingual Book Club . <p> 1 . SIZE MATTERS : Who will your readers be ? A few kids and their parent or parents , guardians , or older siblings who can read with them at home . The club should be small : maybe three or four kids , accompanying parents , and one facilitator . The smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more manageable it is , the more orderly it will be ; and the more orderly the dub , better is the chance of it being a regular activity . Delgado Gaitan ( 2004 ) concurs : " Getting Latino parents to stay involved in their children 's education and maintain connection with the school means that a well-defined structure needs to be in place for them to feel at home in the school " ( p. 55 ) . <p> In addition , a smaller group means parents will feel more comfortable taking part in the actual discussion . This does not mean you limit yourself to just one group ; organize multiple clubs that meet during the school year , even if not at the same moment of the same day . The key is to serve as many kids and their parents as possible . <p> 2 . DELEGATE How feasible is the notion of multiple book clubs under one librarian 's guidance ? It is not very feasible , unless you delegate much of the work , This means recruiting volunteers who will agree to facilitate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look and sound like parent participants , e.g. , Latino parents already active in the school ; <p>  --  have a vested interest in the community , e.g. , business owners , politicians , and religious leaders ; <p>  --  share our vision of literacy success in children , e.g. , library science and education majors looking to serve and learn . <p> 3 . READERS , READERS EVERYWHERE ... Where does a librarian find non- or reluctant readers to transform into life-long readers ? This is the time to speak directly to your classroom teachers and counselors . They should certainly be familiar with each child in your school , know his or her literacy level , and know who needs support in the classroom and in the home . Ask your teacher or counselor to recommend three or four children who would benefit most from this kind of intervention . Your teacher or counselor can also approach parents about participating in the Book Club , explain the benefits , as well as the goals and desired outcomes , and so on . <p> 4 . WHERE , OH WHERE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book club ? It might make sense to meet in the library because the teacher-librarian is leader . However , part of the purpose of the club is to encourage parents to become more active on school grounds , but parents often find the building overwhelming . Therefore , begin in a neutral zone . Consider partnering with a community center , the local bookstore , the neighborhood church , even a participant 's front porch . In a neutral zone , you the school representative are not perceived to be " in charge . " Whatever venue you choose , rest assured , within a few meetings , parents will grow more comfortable with you as a fellow advocate , and the move to the library will not be threatening . Once there , parents will slowly stretch their comfort levels by exploring hallways , classrooms , and administrative offices . They will take co-ownership of the school and their children 's academic success . The point is that educators build trust in the process . <p> 5 . BOOKS AS REFLECTIONS OF CLUB PARTICIPANTS Now , what books shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 've included a selected bibliography , however , it is important to acquire multiple copies of titles selected . The books should be bilingual , but it is not enough to choose a title simply because it is in English and Spanish . It is necessary to offer books that are culturally relevant to parents . They are more likely to enjoy the process if they see and hear themselves presented in the stories , too . Xavier Garza 's ( 2005 picture book lucha Libre : The Man in the Silver Mask : A Bilingual Cuento is an ideal choice because a majority of Mexicans grow up watching lucha libre , a Latino counterpart to World Wrestling Entertainment . In it , Carlitos ' father takes the boy to his first match where he learns about the tecnicos ( faces ) and rudos ( heels ) . For the older reader , Diane Bertrand 's ( 1999 ) novel Trino 's Choice is a great selection . In his early teens , Trino must learn right from wrong in a world where it is much easier to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single parent with two jobs , but finds it difficult to make ends meet . Imagine the discussion that will take place if a parent can say to a child , " Oh , that story reminds me of when I was your age . " <p> 6 . FUNDING MATTERS * Think Locally : Whether large or small , businesses are often looking for opportunities to do good deeds in the community . * Think Culturally : Latino/a-owned business owners should be approached for assistance . * Think Big : There may be a corporate business with an already-established literacy grant program right there in your city . * WHO IS THE BOSS ? Initially , you or the volunteer will want to explain the ground rules of the book club ( these will vary from group to group or teacher-librarian to teacher-librarian ) . While you participate in the discussions , it is important to allow parents as much freedom to participate , but model for them what educators look for as indicative of reading success ( understanding character , setting , and conflict in a book ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a " parent education workshop " ( Delgado Gaitan , 2004 , p. 57 ) , a venue where parents can begin to gain an " understanding of their role in the school system " ( p. 20 ) . Allow parents to discuss their concerns related to school topics without the fear of retribution ; teach them what the system expects of the child academically ; and advise them on how to help meet those expectations at home . <p> L : THE BOOK CLUB AND THE OLDER , COOLER STUDENT As the years pass , or if you are implementing this book club at the middle and high school levels , you may need to do some modification . As children grow into young adulthood and become social creatures , they are often concerned about image and reputation and so do not want to be seen with parents , much less under these nerdy conditions . Allow for " non-book " book clubs , that is , host " parent education workshops " in order to give parents the language necessary to discuss their children 's books at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) says : " In schools using English only , as students move up in grade , the reading material demands more of the parents . Parents may feel inadequate about reading with their children in English , but they try to stay engaged in their children 's learning by encouraging them " ( p. 54 ) . However , they need to do more than just encourage their children . If parents are reading the same material their older kids are assigned , though perhaps in the parents ' first language , and you have provided them the lingo , they will do more than just encourage their children . <p> L : TECHNOLOGY : A FRIEND TO THE BOOK CLUB Let us think about one more dimension of our book club idea . Enter technology . More and more children and teens have access to computers and the Internet at school and at home . In a growing number of schools , every young person has his or her own computer that can be taken home as well as used during school hours . This new digital world provides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book clubs operating simultaneously in the digital world . Imagine the book club leader offers a question to be discussed by both parent and child . The parent knows the questions will require a joint answer , and so asks the child what question needs to be answered . If there is Internet access at home , then the joint answer can be typed into a blog or wiki . If there is no access , then the joint answer can be typed into a word processor ( or written down ) for the student to upload the next day at school . This new dimension may encourage the parent to learn computer skills From their children or the other way around . Perhaps ICT literacy grows simultaneously along with reading , conversation , parent/child discussion , and conversation with other Latinos online , while everyone enjoys books together . <p> L : IMAGINE SUCCESS ... Imagine the following scenario playing out sometime later at a child 's home : morn gets home from work and while fixing the evening 's supper , asks her daughter , " Mi'ja , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name of the main character ? Tell me about him . ... Is the setting more like where we live or different ? Oh , and what is the problem he is trying to solve ? " <p> Compare that to what usually takes place : " Mi'ja , are you done with your homework ? Good . Now let me sign the homework log your teacher sent with you . " <p> Both illustrations present a parent who cares a great deal about her daughter 's academic success . The former , though , demonstrates how even a few words added to a parent 's language reservoir ( Trelease , 2006 , p. 33 ) can improve the chances of a child becoming a life-long reader , and thus academically successful . <p> Opening your library to these book clubs is one example of not merely thinking outside the box , but of tearing down the box that is not working for certain children and their parents . It requires constructing a new box -- one that is most certainly nontraditional , yet insists that parents be active participants in their children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their first and comfortable language ; and redefines parental involvement so children benefit directly and immediately rather than only the school benefiting ( Delgado Gaitan , 2004 , p. 19 ) . This is because you , as educator , are not satisfied with serving only some children . All because you want every one of your students to love reading and books as much as you do . All because you care , and you dare . <p> Added Benefits for Parent Participants : They will : a . Begin to learn the language of academia b . Become better acquainted with and feel more at ease on campus c . Take on school-related responsibilities . d . Take leadership roles in school . <p> L : REFERENCES  --  Auerbach , S. ( 2007 ) .
