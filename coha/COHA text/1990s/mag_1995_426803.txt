New designs emphasize safety and convenience <p> EVERY GARDENER at one time or another has a need for a chain saw . Whether the tree to be cut is shading the garden or has already been brought down by a storm . a chain saw is the tool of choice for swiftly and efficiently sectioning even the most massive trunk into manageable pieces . While the largest jobs are best left ro the professional . there are plenty of occasions where a chain saw of one 's own is a real asset . <p> Gardeners should shop for chain saws in the 35- to 60-cubic-inch range ( roughly 2 to 5 horsepower ) . These typically accommodate a range of bar ( blade ) lengths from 15 to 20 inches . Although it may be tempting to buy the longest bar for a particular saw , remember that shorter ones are easier to use and are perfectly cabable of cutting trunks of a diameter twice the bar 's length . <p> Fortunately , today 's chain saws are easier and safer to use than ever before . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their two-cycle engines and lubricating oil for their chains , the new models incorporate significant improvements in designs and materials . As a result , you no longer need the physique of a lumberjack to use one . Durable plastic has replaced metal for many of the components , reducing the weight of the machine and the associated fatigue of using it . <p> Reduced vibration and noise have been other improvements . Today 's chain saw engines are completely isolated from the handles by vibration-dampening rubber mounts . More efficient mufflers decrease the output of noise , and the hearing-protection devices to be worn by the user are now better designed and more comfortable to wear . <p> All chain saws now come with a chain brake , a device designed to protect operators against a phenomenon known as kickback . Kickback occurs when the tip of a blade comes in contact with a solid object and the moving chain causes the saw to kick upward , sometimes violently . In saws equipped with a chain brake , such a movement forces a lever forward . This in turn causes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopping the chain in a matter of milliseconds . <p> Some saws also possess tip guards , a metal cover bolted to the end of the bar , effectively shielding the portion of the moving chain that causes kickback in the first place . But tip guards can get in the way when you are cutting very large diameter logs , and are thus usually removable . Hence the importance of the integral chain brake . <p> All chain saws sold in the United States meet the strict safety standards set by the American National Standards Institute , but good design is no substitute for safe working habits . The key to avoiding mishaps is learning good habits from the start , or getting rid of those bad habits you may have already picked up . First , always wear safe clothing , including a helmet , gloves , chaps , and eye and ear protection . All of this gear is readily available . If you do n't already own it , buy it when you buy your saw , regardless of how much cutting you plan to do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra precautions . <p> Be sure you inspect the work site before you begin cutting , and remove obstacles that may cause you to stumble . Then start your saw in the manner outlined in your owner 's manual , and shut it off when you are not actually cutting . Make a habit of stopping every 10 or 15 minutes to stretch and relax . <p> Chain saws are capable of doing a tremendous amount of work in a short time . Treat them with the respect they deserve , and they will reward you for your troubles many times over . <p> For sources of chain saws listed in the chart on page 68 , turn to page 83 .
