The taxi driver , whose name was not Jean Baptiste as the identification plate on the dashboard announced in large red letters , adjusted the vents so that the heat blasted directly onto his chest . The metallic winter air cut easily through his thin cotton jacket . His real name was Auguste Rire . He had assumed his new name fifteen years ago when he had fled Haiti for New York with his brother Pierre who was now called Paul . Jean hated the cold . Many fares had told him that winter made them feel more alive , quickened the senses , expanded the lungs . He had no such experience . Cold made him numb , listless , even depressed . He refused to wear wool because it made his skin itch . <p> The taxi sped along Grand Central Parkway toward Manhattan . Chickens raced across the highway . A pair of purple hightops dangled from a traffic light . In the taxi , two passengers , Clay and Nora James , sat side by side on the back seat . They were deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Kennedy Airport . The taxi driver hummed along with the radio . Nora 's musky perfume mingled with the odor of pine air freshener and a burning smell coming from the heater . Clay opened his window even though the temperature outside was below freezing . The driver turned up the heat . <p> Clay pulled a strand of brown hair from the crown of his head , then announced , " Truth is inconceivable to you . " <p> The driver turned his head toward the backseat and said over the music , " Yes , yes , yes . " <p> Clay shook his head . " I 'm sorry , " he said to the driver . " I was n't talking to you . I was talking to my wife . " He pointed at Nora . <p> " I simply feel , Clay , " Nora said , ignoring the interruption , " that beauty is relative . " She flipped open a compact mirror and rubbed a lipstick over her lips . <p> " Relative is precisely what I mean . " Clay ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There is a universal aesthetic hierarchy . At the top is pure unadulterated beauty and at the bottom is unredeemable ugliness . Everything in between is relative to those absolutes , which comprise the truth . " <p> " Your scale is not necessarily mine , " Nora said just as the taxi hit a pothole causing the lipstick to make a pink dot at the end of her nose . She smiled at the mirror . A woman with hazel eyes , silver black hair , and a pink dot on the tip of her nose smiled back . <p> " You are obviously unwilling to accept your insignificance in the universe . " Clay sighed , then continued . " Individual scales are ultimately nothing more than devices we cling to in order to give ourselves the illusion of stability . " He pulled out another hair . He slid it up and down between his thumb and forefinger , feeling its scales . If stroked in one direction , the hair was smooth . When the direction of the stroke was reversed the hair became resistant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An Elton John song came on the radio . " You see everything in terms of yourself , " Clay went on , " but beauty is something beyond us . Beauty is a truth , the truth , like good and evil . " <p> During the twenty-three years Nora and Clay had been married , conversations similar to this one had occurred with great regularity . In the beginning , the discussion would often develop into a fullblown argument and might lead to weeks of antagonism between the couple . By now , however , the familiarity of the words , the words themselves had become an anchor for the two of them together , a place where they could rest and take shelter . <p> " Precisely . " Nora wiped off her nose and pinched her own cheeks the way an irritating aunt might do to her nephew . " We all see the world in terms of ourselves . How else could we possibly see it ? But you delude yourself by conceiving of some higher truth by which you justify your world view without taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She closed her compact with a definitive click and dropped it back into her purse . " I 'm cold , " she said . <p> " Yes , " the cabdriver said . " It 's very cold . " Clay glared at Nora , then reached over and rolled up the window . Nora smiled at Jean , who saw her in the rear view mirror and smiled back . " Excuse me if I have been listening to your conversation , " he said , " but I find it fascinating . Both of your positions are , on one level , tenable . But on the deepest level truth is inconceivable when we are awake . Only dreams reveal the truth . " Nora stopped smiling and looked at Clay with both fear and amusement in her eyes . Clay rolled his eyes at her as if to say , " that 's what you get for siding with the cabdriver . " <p> " Oh , yes , of course , " Nora said feebly and looked out the window . A rat jogged along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from an overpass . Nora remembered a ladder leaning against the side of the house she grew up in . She also remembered her older brother Ned lying beside the ladder when he was ten years old , his head in a pool of dark blood . Nora did n't actually see Ned fall because she had been at a birthday party . She only saw him much later when he was already in the hospital . <p> His room was at the end of a long hall that smelled like the bathroom at Sunday school . In the room several beds were enclosed by high metal bars . When she looked at her brother through the bars she understood that he was going to die . The skin on his face and hands was translucent . His lips were crinkled and gray like shed snakeskin . The whites of his eyes and the moons of his fingernails had turned the color of mustard . <p> Nora , then , made a pact with herself . In order for Ned to live , Xora , Nora 's imaginary friend , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did everything wrong . She broke all the rules , swore , and would n't eat her food . Her behavior regularly astonished Nora , but Xora remained her best friend in the world . Xora 's sacrifice took place over several days during which time she lost all of the rose in her cheeks and blue in her lips . Her silver eyes slowly tarnished to a dull and neutral black . Finally the sound of her voice became fainter and fainter , until she disappeared entirely from Nora 's life . Ned , as it turned out , died anyway . Nora , who had not thought about Xora once in over thirty years , put her hand flat and eye level against the glass of the taxi window and said , " No . " <p> Clay put his arm around Nora and whispered , " Do n't engage with the driver . He may be a raving lunatic . " <p> " You 're racist , " she whispered back . <p> Jean , in a husky tenor , began to sing along with Elton John . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , all the papers had to say , was that Marilyn was found in the nude . . . " <p> Clay had contemplated suicide for the first time on his ninth birthday . The apartment where he grew up on the upper East side was packed with perhaps fifteen children and their parents . Clay had n't wanted to invite any girls , he remembered , but finally he had relented after figuring out that each girl meant one more present . The party was an enormous success . Clay won at pin the tail on the donkey and musical chairs . It was his blow that exploded the pinata , and the magician singled him out to be his assistant for most of the tricks . The only damper on the whole affair was Rupert , whom Clay had n't even invited . Clay 's mother had . When Clay had objected saying that he was weird , a loner , and he did n't go to the same school , Clay 's mother had insisted . " His parents are divorcing , " she had explained . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play any of the games . When he was cajoled by the adults to join in , he was the first to lose . Clay could barely look at him . His clothes were dirty , his hair greasy , his nose covered in both wet and dry snot . Clay wished with all of his heart that Rupert would disappear , and at a certain point during the party he did . Clay noticed , said nothing to his mother , and felt deeply relieved . <p> After a while , as the party was winding down , Clay took his best friend to his room to show off the presents he had received that morning from his mother and father . Other kids saw them go and followed . When Clay opened the door to his room , he immediately saw Rupert , with his droopy red eyes , sitting in the corner between the bed and window picking his nose . " What are you doing in my room ? " he shouted , running over to where Rupert was crouched . " You 're disgusting . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ugly , " Clay 's best friend repeated . <p> " Stupid , ugly , " said another child who had followed them . <p> " Stupid , ugly , " the other children chanted as they crowded into Clay 's room and made a semi-circle around Rupert . <p> " Stupid , ugly , " Rupert whispered along with them . <p> Clay 's mother walked into the room . She was a tall , beautiful woman with long blond hair and dark eyes . Every boy in Clay 's class at school was in love with her . Clay 's mother was a considerable boon for him . Popular boys , jocks , boys who had million-dollar trust funds wanted to come over to play with Clay because of his mother . The chanting stopped when the children realized Clay 's mother was in the room . The children parted for her as she made her way over to Rupert . She took his hand and led him over to Clay 's bed where she sat down , lifted him on to her lap , and put an arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children watched . <p> " Rupert is my special friend , " she said . " And if any of you wants to be my friend you will have to be Rupert 's friend too . " She looked into the eyes of each child in the room while stroking Rupert 's hair with her long fingers . <p> " Mrs. Taylor , " Rupert then said , in front of all Clay 's friends . " Would you marry me ? " <p> Clay wanted only one thing : to die . He watched his mother blush , then heard her say , though he could n't believe his ears : " Why of course I 'll marry you Rupert , but when you 're old enough you wo n't want to marry me . " And giggling she kissed him on the forehead . <p> At that moment Clay ran from the room and locked himself in the bathroom and would n't come out . He sobbed for hours while thinking of how he would kill himself : jumping from the window , throwing himself in front of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his parents ' medicine cabinet , drinking every cleaner under the kitchen sink , sticking his head in the oven , cutting off his wrists . These thoughts were interrupted regularly by his mother 's voice , which came from the other side of the bathroom door . " Clay , darling , " she said , " I promise I am not going to marry Rupert . I was only trying to make Rupert feel better . Open the door , please . " <p> While in the bathroom , Clay had a revelation of sorts . He discovered that he could not kill himself because to do so would disrupt the nature of the world . Who was he to decide if someone , even himself , should live or die ? With a new and great humility , Clay opened the bathroom door . It was early the following morning and his mother lay on the floor asleep , her long blond hair cascading over the green silk quilt wrapped around her . He quietly stepped over her and went into the kitchen where he poured himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one gulp without breathing . <p> Clay removed his arm from around Nora 's shoulder and pulled out another hair . " As usual , " he whispered , " you jump to conclusions . In fact , to accuse me of racism is itself racist . It means you do not have enough respect for our driver as an individual to allow him the possible race-free status of raving lunatic . " <p> When the song was over Jean tried to recall in as much detail as possible his instructions . For the past three nights a lamb with seven horns and seven eyes had appeared in his dreams admonishing him to keep a vigilant watch for a sign . When Jean asked the lamb what form the sign would take , when it might appear , and what it would mean , the lamb closed all seven eyes and disappeared . Jean peered intently through his windshield , his eyes meticulously scanning the landscape . To him , everything was a sign . The chickens he had seen earlier crossing the highway meant prosperity , the hightops were a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicated bad weather , and the ladder foretold the unexpected arrival of relatives . But when Jean Baptiste saw a white man with no clothes riding a white horse in St. Michael 's Cemetery , he immediately understood that this was no ordinary sign . He turned off the music and began speaking a swift and animated Creole into a short wave radio receiver . <p> Nora 's eyes followed the driver 's undulating lips . Although she was fluent in French , she could only make out the word cheval or cheveux , horse or hair . " Stop pulling out your hair , " she whispered as she grabbed Clay 's hand and held it . " You 're upsetting the cabdriver . " Clay brusquely took his hand away from her but did not pull out another hair . <p> Nora surveyed the front seat area . On the dashboard sat a blurred photograph of Aristide and a miniature painting of a brightly colored jungle scene . A tiger , an elephant , a monkey , a zebra , and a giraffe peered out from behind lush , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Garden of Eden . The animals , however , did not appear to be looking for each other but for something or someone outside the frame . The painting was signed Henri Rire . <p> Jean replaced the receiver and glanced again in the rear view mirror . Nora was still staring at the dashboard and Clay was looking down at his hands clenched in his lap . Jean pulled off the highway and headed for St. Michael 's Cemetery . The TLC would slap him with all sorts of fines that would take years to pay off or he might even lose his cab entirely , but ignoring a dream could have far worse consequences , as Jean had learned the hard way while he was still living in Haiti . <p> When he was ten years old , his dead grandfather appeared to him in a dream . In the dream his grandfather looked as he had just before he died , a skeleton with a thin layer of skin covering his bones . The only difference was his teeth . His grandfather , a sorghum farmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man and had wished his whole life for a set of false ones , which he never got . But in the dream he sported a pearly white set of buck teeth . As his grandfather spoke to him the teeth-as big as piano keys-shone so brightly , once or twice Jean had to look away . He was so distracted by the teeth that he barely heard his grandfather 's warning that for three nights from sundown to sunup no one in the family should be at home . <p> The next day all Jean could think about were his grandfather 's huge white teeth and how maybe it was true that you got what you wished for-maybe even more than you wished for-in the afterlife . He was so absorbed by thinking about what he would wish for-an astronaut suit , an unlimited supply of apples , a set of paints-that he forgot what his grandfather had told him . <p> That night , while he and his brother went flashlight fishing in the harbour , the Tontons Macoute slaughtered his father , mother , and sister . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was involved in politics . But Jean and his brother became known as the sons of a traitor and were forced to leave Haiti for their own survival . <p> Many years later it was revealed that the Macoute had mistaken the address and killed the wrong family , but by that time Jean and Paul were about to buy a third taxi for their growing fleet . Jean was convinced that his failure to connect with spiritual life had cost him his family . The seven-eyed lamb was the first dream communication he had received since then . <p> " I am sorry , " said Jean as he cut across traffic to an exit ramp , " we need to make a detour . " <p> Clay lifted his eyes from his lap and sat forward . " A detour ? " he exclaimed . " There 's no traffic . " <p> Jean drove up the shoulder of the ramp past a line of cars waiting at a traffic light . He made a left turn on a red light . Horns protested . A teenage girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through another red light and in among crisscrossed streets lined with small pastel-colored two-story houses . <p> " We 're being hijacked , " Nora said to Clay . The tone of her voice was calm and certain , as if now everything finally made sense . <p> " Here , " said Clay , pushing his wallet over the seat toward Jean , " take it . Just let us go . My bank code is my birthday . " <p> Jean shook his head and pushed the wallet back toward Clay . " No , no , you do n't understand , " he said . " I do n't want to rob you . We 're making a detour . You see , I had a dream . " <p> " A dream ? " asked Nora , as the cab sped past Snow White and the Seven Dwarves holding hands on someone 's lawn . <p> " A sheep told me to look for a sign . Just now I saw a naked white man riding a white horse in the graveyard . I asked my brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and he says I better check it out . " <p> " A sign for what ? " asked Nora . Clay touched her arm , then pointed to his temple and made a circling motion with his finger . <p> " I do n't know , " he answered . " But I do not want any more blood on my hands . " <p> Clay and Nora looked at each other then looked away . Jean stopped the cab just inside the iron gate entrance to St. Michael 's . He pulled on the emergency brake and leaped out of the car . He cut diagonally through the large gray stones looking up one avenue and down the next . Small mounds of snow clung to graves like a white fungus , obscuring names , dates , effigies , hands clasped in prayer . Blankets made of evergreens and poinsettias lay scattered , mostly on fresh graves . The brittle twigs of a large , bare tree scratched at the sky . Jean searched for hoof prints , horse manure , anything that might indicate the horseman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He saw nothing , no one . <p> Having lost all feeling in the tops of his ears and finger tips , Jean Baptiste gave up searching among the tombstones for the horseman . He returned to his cab . It was empty , the trunk open . He climbed into the back seat . Strands of Clay 's hair were scattered over the seat and floor . Nora 's perfume clung to what was left of the warm air . Over the short wave radio , his brother 's voice called his name . Jean lay down across the seat and closed his eyes . <p> Clay and Nora walked in silence along the road that ran beside the cemetery . A high spiked wrought-iron fence separated them from the graves . As soon as Jean was out of sight , they had gotten out of the car , grabbed their bags from the trunk , and set off down the road . Nora experienced a deja vu . She was convinced she had previously been abandoned with her husband in a graveyard by a taxi driver in search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of when this had occurred , she glanced into the cemetery several times to be sure the horseman was n't really there . <p> Finally she spoke . " Cindy Crawford may look hideously ugly to a Zulu or a Maori , " she said the words carefully . " Fat is a sign of great beauty in Rajasthan . Deformed feet once drove men wild in China . Beauty is a relative concept . " <p> Clay did n't answer right away . He searched in among the graves . As he turned away , he reached up and tugged on a strand of hair . " Yes , " he said , " but a sunset is a sunset no matter where you are . " <p> A phone booth stood by the side of the road , but they did n't stop to call . Cars sped past , even a taxi , but they did n't hail it . <p>
