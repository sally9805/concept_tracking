Getting nervous ? In the past two weeks , the Dow Jones industrial average has fallen 529 points , a drop of nearly 10% since its August peak , punctuating a dismal third quarter . Investors are hoping  --  praying might be a better word  --  that Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan will decide against the third interest-rate hike of 1999 when the central bank 's Open Market Committee meets this week . <P> Much of the trouble stems from a single concern : the weakening U.S. dollar . The greenback had been the strong , silent type for the past six years , making European vacations and Japanese electronics cheaper , while at the same time attracting foreign capital to the U.S. stock-and-bond markets by the trillions . Although the dollar 's decline amounts to only 3% against major currencies like the euro , it is off nearly 15% against the Japanese yen since March . <P> Why should we care ? Because if the buck falls out of bed , there 's trouble ahead . Consumers will have to pay more for imports , which can light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 17% of all consumer goods bought in the U.S. , or $407 billion , up from only 5.4% , or $19.2 billion , in 1970 . <P> The economy looks pretty healthy until you think about the $1 billion Americans borrow from abroad  --  each day  --  to support their big appetite for foreign stuff . Result : this year 's current-account deficit , which measures the gap in both trade and investment flows , is headed for $300 billion , up from $155 billion in 1997 . That is worrisome to Joel Prakken , chairman of Macroeconomic Advisers , a St. Louis , Mo. , forecasting firm , who says , " U.S. indebtedness is growing more than three times faster than the economy , and that ca n't be sustained . " <P> That has the market spooked too . Foreigners have been taking the dollars they get as payment for goods and services and investing them in U.S. stocks and bonds . If the dollar continues to droop , they may be tempted to move their cash to currencies on the upswing , like the euro and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market lower . The more apocalyptic bears fear something worse . Because foreigners hold almost 40% of U.S. Treasury securities , any pullout would risk a spike in interest rates that would ultimately slaughter the bull market . <P> The dollar 's plight is the first major challenge for Treasury Secretary Larry Summers , 44 , the economist who succeeded Robert ( " Just Right " ) Rubin three months ago . Summers ' mantra  --  " A strong dollar is in the national interest of the United States "  --  was the same one repeated for six years by Rubin , a period during which the Dow rose a mountainous 7,000 points . In contrast , the as yet brief Summers era has seen the index drop some 900 points . But Summers says his focus is on " the fundamentals , " such as creating a budget surplus , which he argues is best for both the economy and the markets . <P> Since the U.S. economy remains basically strong , Treasury officials say the rising yen is Tokyo 's issue . And they 've convinced Japan 's major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi . Everyone , that is , except Masaru Hayami , chief of Japan 's central bank , who late last month got into a public spat with Tokyo 's powerful Ministry of Finance because the Bank of Japan refuses to lower interest rates or print money to bring the yen back to earth .
