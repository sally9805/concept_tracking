<p> This should have been the fiscal year that New York City turned the corner . After five straight years of severe budget problems , of staggering through an endless cycle of cutting services and stretching out debt , the city got a half-billion-dollar gift : a temporary downturn in debt service payments to the Municipal Assistance Corporation . <p> It was a rare opportunity  --  not only to balance the 1995 budget but to buy time , to start taking long-term measures that would n't necessarily pay off this year but would lead to big savings in the future . As the City Council holds hearings into next year 's budget  --  still severely out of balance despite the deep cuts proposed by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani  --  it has become all too clear that the opportunity was wasted . <p> Soon after the council adopted the budget last June , state and city fiscal monitors reported that it was about $1 billion out of balance . Apparently , the Mayor and council had gambled that an improving economy and a friendly administration in Albany would make up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put spending controls in place and , in October , presented budget changes to close the billion-dollar gap . But a losing game of catch-up had already begun . A quarter of the fiscal year was over ; agencies had begun operating with unbalanced budgets . The Mayor and council spent three months battling over budget authority , and as they did so the city 's economy stalled , so tax revenues came up at least $400 million short . <p> And the city is still scrambling . One-shot deficit-closing actions now come to at least $1.8 billion this year . This is more than two and a half times the average amount of one-shot actions in the past five years of economic downturn . <p> Some of these measures are defensible , but others seem inspired by sheer desperation . Consider the proposal to sell the state two city-owned jails near the Canadian border . It is hard to know which is the more serious risk to the city 's fiscal health : not getting the State Legislature 's approval for this sale , or getting it . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ budget . Under the second , the $120 million from the sale would go entirely toward closing this year 's budget gap , while the city would still have to pay off $113 million in bonds it issued in 1988 to build the jails . State Comptroller Carl McCall calls this " capitalizing operating expenses , " the same behavior that cut New York City off from the bond market in the mid-1970 's . The nontechnical taxpayer will recognize it as comparable to selling the house , blowing the proceeds at the race track and still being stuck with the mortgage . <p> Whether defensible or not , such one-shot actions have no recurring value . As a result , in 1996 the city faces its largest deficit ( at least $2.7 billion , or 13 percent of revenues ) in the past 15 years . <p> And the city still has to get through this fiscal year , which ends June 30 . Standard &; Poor 's has placed the bond ratings of the city and its Health and Hospitals Corporation on a negative credit watch . Though the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its budget balanced , there are still considerable risks ; the biggest , they say , is at the Board of Education , where a sizable slippage in efforts to close its spending gap illustrates that the longer you wait to solve a problem , the harder it becomes . <p> While this is the city 's worst fiscal plight since the 1970 's , it is hardly a new one . In the past five years a sort of equilibrium has set in , with rolling quarterly shortfalls , new spending cuts , one-shot gap-closing measures and refinancing of debt . The focus is short-term in the extreme , the pressure is exhausting for all participants , and the uncertainty about future services punishes every city resident , from schoolchildren to subway riders ( and their employers ) . <p> The only way to break the cycle is to move toward structural balance  --  a situation in which revenue and spending are about the same size and grow at roughly the same rate . And the path is no mystery : it was laid out on Dec. 1 , 1993 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Donald Kummerfeld , a former city budget director ; Dall Forsythe , a former state budget director , and William Gray 3d , a former chairman of the Budget Committee of the House of Representatives . <p> Right now , the growth in spending exceeds the growth in revenue by about 2 percent a year as far as the eye can see . Structural balance , then , means making tough choices that cut the growth of spending and permanently increase revenue . The 1993 report presented a full array of the necessary spending cuts , some of which the city has begun : reducing the number of employees and their compensation ; reducing debt service ; eliminating certain subsidies and duplicative services , and consolidating agencies . <p> As for revenues , the Kummerfeld report said bluntly that structural balance could not be achieved by spending cuts alone . Revenues must be raised , the report said , and argued that it could be done in ways that would do the least damage to the economy : delay scheduled tax cuts ; introduce a combination of fees and charges for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Most important , they called for reform of the city 's largest tax , theproperty tax , which is now skewed in favor of single-family homeowners and against commercial property owners . Such a change is not only a matter of equity ; it would help restore the property tax to its historical role as the stabilizer of the revenue side of the budget . <p> Putting structural balance at the center of the city 's budget planning can not be the responsibility of the Mayor alone . It requires full participation by the City Council , and recognition in Albany that the state has a real stake in the long-term fiscal health of New York City . <p> Some new budget rules can help , too . The city 's financial plan should make structural balance an explicit goal , with the pattern of recurring spending and revenues monitored and reported in the same way as the annual gap-closing program . The city should commit itself to a cap on one-shot actions in any given year . While there is no hard rule on where to set that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $700 million . Finally , rather than reporting after the fact , the fiscal monitors , or at least the city comptroller , should be required to verify before adoption that the proposed budget deal between the council and the Mayor is in fact a balanced budget . <p> As desperate as the city 's plight looks now , it can get worse . So far the bond markets have accommodated the city . Bondholders are requiring , and the city has been all to happy to pay , a higher rate of interest than is generally appropriate for its investment-grade rating . But the markets can turn . <p> Changes in securities regulations , interest rates or exchange rates , as well as the national trend toward tax cutting at all levels of government , may lower demand for tax-exempt municipal bonds or generate a flight to higher-quality bonds . City debt service is increasing again , even with a one-third cut in the capital budget . Declines in commercial property values are lowering the ceiling on both the amount of debt the city can issue and the property taxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the budget further . The city could lose its one remaining investment-grade bond rating . That 's why it 's more urgent than ever to listen to what the Kummerfeld report told us almost a year and a half ago .
