( Lights up on the top of a tank . Only the top of the tank/tower is in view , the rest is in darkness . YOUNG AL and YOUNG BIRDY are on top . YOUNG AL sits on YOUNG BIRDY 'S feet as YOUNG BIRDY leans out over the edge to fish for pigeons roosting in slats on the side of the tower . They seem very high up . ) YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Let 's get out of here before we get caught . We 've got enough . YOUNG BIRDY Just a couple more , Al . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Hey , that last one was junk . Stop handing me junk . YOUNG BIRDY He was just small . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO See if you can get a Blue Bar . How many we got in the loft already ? YOUNG BIRDY About eighteen . We can make it thirty tonight . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO But no junk . And then we 're out of here . ( YOUNG BIRDY inches further over the side . ) YOUNG BIRDY There 's more good ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've got enough . Let 's go . p. 3 YOUNG BIRDY Listen . There 's a white king in there . I can hear her . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Get on with it . Grab her and get back up here . YOUNG BIRDY Hold me Al . I can almost reach . ( There is a clatter and pigeons flap in the dark behind them . YOUNG AL sees birds escaping from his sack and leans back to shut it . YOUNG BIRDY 's legs swing over the edge and he 's gone from YOUNG AL 's view . There is silence . YOUNG AL does n't move . We hear pigeons rushing in the darkness . YOUNG AL slides on his stomach towards the edge where YOUNG BIRDY is clinging to the slits . ) YOUNG BIRDY Gim me a hand up , Al . ( YOUNG AL tries to reach for YOUNG BIRDY 's hand but ca n't bear to get closer to the edge . YOUNG BIRDY tries to get a leg over the edge and fails . ) YOUNG BIRDY Al . YOUNG AL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't hold on that long . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Yes you can . YOUNG BIRDY You 'll be alright , Al . I 'll grab your hand , then pull me up . ( YOUNG AL catches his hand . The two boys are balanced there , precariously , each time YOUNG BIRDY moves ; YOUNG AL slips a little farther over the edge. ) p. 4 YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Oh God . Christ . I ca n't ( Beat ) I pissed . YOUNG BIRDY It 's O K Al . I 'll try and make it to the coal pile . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO What are you doing ? Shit . YOUNG BIRDY I can do it . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO No ! Do n't be crazy . ( With his free hand YOUNG BIRDY arranges the burlap bag in front of him , then manages to turn around so he 's hanging facing away from the tank and readies himself to shove off the tank . ) YOUNG AL COLUMBATO You 'll kill yourself . ( YOUNG BIRDY lets go of YOUNG AL 's hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lights black out . We hear a roaring sound of pigeons flapping and YOUNG AL 's cry among them . ) YOUNG AL COLUMBATO No ! ( The lights come up on SGT AL , also screaming as he wakes from a nightmare . Lights fade . ) AL COLUMBATO No ! ( Again we see YOUNG AL , climbing down the ladder of a tank . He approaches YOUNG BIRDY , who is sitting up , very white , on a coal pile . The wind is knocked out of him . YOUNG AL sits down beside him . Silence. ) p. 5 YOUNG BIRDY I did it . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO You did n't just fall off that tank . YOUNG BIRDY It was beautiful . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO If you 'd fallen , you 'd be smashed . Right here . Smashed . YOUNG BIRDY I flew . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Want me to get somebody ? YOUNG BIRDY ( YOUNG AL reaches his hand and touches YOUNG BIRDY 's face . ) I 'm alright .

( End Scene One ) p. 6 Act 1 , Scene 2 Scene Two ( Major DR WHITE and SGT AL in the hospital office . ) DR . WHITE A glass jaw ? That does n't sound right . AL COLUMBATO Well , not glass exactly , Sir . The whole jaw got smashed so they had to put in some metal parts . A whack at the right angle could undo the pins . Shock me in the brain . DR . WHITE Then my advice is be careful no one ever takes a swing at you , right Sergeant ? AL COLUMBATO ( Tired of hearing this advice . ) Yes , sir . Right , sir . DR . WHITE Young man , I may be a major , but I 'm a doctor as well . Do you find that hard to believe ? ( No response from SGT AL . ) So . What do you think of Kentucky ? AL COLUMBATO ( Glancing around ) Never been here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Really ? Why 's that ? AL COLUMBATO This is the blue grass State . On the bus ride in , I did n't see nothing but green . DR . WHITE ( Laughs ) Blue grass is a type of grass . But it 's green in color . A lot of . Visitors . Make that mistake . p. 7 AL COLUMBATO Do they , sir ? ( A silence between them ) DR . WHITE Sergeant , you were sent down here from the hospital at Dix . But not for your own condition . Some of my colleagues think that you might be able to help me . With your friend . AL COLUMBATO I do n't know about that , sir . What 's the matter with him ? DR . WHITE ( Ignores SGT AL 's question ) Tell me . How long were you two friends ? AL COLUMBATO Since we were thirteen . ( YOUNG AL appears , watching them , but neither man is aware of him . ) DR . WHITE Were you close friends ? AL COLUMBATO Best friends . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the patient like as a kid ? AL COLUMBATO Like most kids , I guess . DR . WHITE Can you remember anything particular about him ? AL COLUMBATO He was smart . Very smart . DR . WHITE Everything you tell me will be in confidence , I assure you , Sergeant . p. 8 AL COLUMBATO Could you tell me , sir , what happened to him ? DR . WHITE I 've spoken to his mother and father . They came down to verify the identification . He 'd been reported as missing for over a month and his I D was gone , no record where he 'd been or what happened . His parents recognized him , but there was no recognition from the patient . His parents were not helpful . Did n't seem to know much about him from a psychological standpoint . But then parents rarely do know what 's inside the brains of their children . If they did , they 'd probably kill them . ( DR WHITE waits for SGT AL to laugh at his joke . SGT AL just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a joke . ( Beat ) Anyway , at that time , if anyone came near your friend he would go into frantic jumping and twisting activities , falling to the floor . It was almost as if he were trying to escape . AL COLUMBATO That does n't sound like him at all , sir . DR . WHITE Well , I 've never seen anything like this before . He had no head wound when they brought him in but there 's likely some kind of damage to the brain . ( SGT AL turns his head sharply away but makes no other response on hearing this news . Imperceptibly , DR WHITE notes thi.s. ) p. 9 DR . WHITE Just what piece of your friend has been damaged , what is recoverable and what is not , I intend to figure out . I like a good night 's sleep . AL COLUMBATO ( Weary . ) A good night 's sleep . Yeah . I remember having those when I was a kid , sir . ( DR WHITE just eyes SGT AL a few moments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine , Columbato , before you see your friend , report to me . Let 's hope that during your stay here you can make some kind of contact with him . Right now it 's probably the best chance we 've got . Now go get some rest . ( He stands up to dismiss SGT AL . ) And Sergeant . Like most good doctors , I am a man who can smell the bullshit before it manifests itself . Trust me . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Go on . Fuck him with the salute . ( SGT AL salutes DR WHITE . ) YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Hold it till he returns it . ( After some moments DR WHITE returns the salute . ) YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Son-of-a-bitch ( End Scene Two ) p. 10 Act 1 , Scene 3 Scene Three ( YOUNG AL and YOUNG BIRDY under the el-train down town at 63rd St. we hear the noise of the subway passing by , cars and the noise of pigeons flying . ) YOUNG BIRDY See that . When the train passes by , they go back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were doing before . ( He throws some feed . ) YOUNG AL COLUMBATO How come they do n't fly when a car goes by ? YOUNG BIRDY Because there 's lots of cars , the noise is steady . The el only passes every eight minutes . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO That one . That 's the flock leader . YOUNG BIRDY No it 's not . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO How do you know ? YOUNG BIRDY That one there . That 's the leader . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO There 's a pair . YOUNG BIRDY Yeah , their nest is right above us . Like people , they mostly stay in the same pairs . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO And fuck practically all year long . YOUNG BIRDY Pick one out . Any one . I 'll make it come to me. p. 11 YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Oh sure . YOUNG BIRDY Pick one out . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO That one there . The dirty one , pecking under its wing . YOUNG BIRDY Gottcha . ( YOUNG BIRDY concentrates and makes intimate cooing noises . The bird nears him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throws some grain at the pigeon that 's responded . ) YOUNG AL COLUMBATO How do you do that ? YOUNG BIRDY I call to them . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO You ca n't call a particular pigeon out of a flock . Period . YOUNG BIRDY I just did . ( Roar of train passing overhead again , and again we hear the sound of the beating of wings . ) ( Elsewhere on stage we see SGT AL with RENALDI in a squad bedroom . An orange homemade lampshade covers the bare bulb . ) RENALDI He 's been here almost three months . For a long time , they did n't even know who he was . Had to go through all the records for somebody missing in Waiheke , where he was hit . Want some fruitcake ? He got malaria , bad , on top of everything else . I have to feed him anyway . p. 12 AL COLUMBATO Whaddaya mean feed him ; ca n't he feed himself ? RENALDI Nope . He wo n't eat anything ; wants to be fed . I spoon-feed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I just shovel it in . AL COLUMBATO Sounds great . ( Beat ) Nice lamp shade . One of the things I 've never gotten used to in the army is bare light bulbs . At home my mother 's got all the lamps covered with colored lampshades . Gives our house a good Italian look , a place to eat fettuccini or zeppoli . RENALDI I 'm from Steubenville . Ohio . ( Holding out the cake ) Want some ? AL COLUMBATO ( Trying to be casual ) Queers eat fruitcake . That 's what they say . RENALDI Really ? I better tell my Mom . She sends them to me . AL COLUMBATO What are you here for , Renaldi ? RENALDI I 'm a C.O. Conscientious Objector . AL COLUMBATO No shit ? RENALDI It 's hard on my mother . She does n't get to hang a star in her window . If you 're lucky enough to have a son or a husband or brother killed in the war , you get to hang a gold star in your window and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the neighborhood and sent her a blue bandanna with a yellow star on it . Yellow . Not gold . p. 13 AL COLUMBATO You got to expect that . RENALDI She finds shit on the porch . On the doorknob . Not dog shit , either . I guess I 've got to expect that too . ( Pause ) What 's with the face ? AL COLUMBATO The docs at Dix say everything 's fine . They say I 'll look O K , hardly any scars even . Not that it was that great before . I keep having this crazy idea in the back of my mind that I 'm going to come out of these bandages like a butterfly when I used to be a caterpillar . RENALDI You 've come to the right place with a fairy tale like that . AL COLUMBATO Yeah , only I 'm in no rush to take these things off . It 's not because of the way I 'll look . I 'm just not sure I 've finished being a caterpillar . RENALDI So tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guys in your outfit want to fight ? AL COLUMBATO After the first artillery comes in , I ca n't think of anyone charging in there for the old war . The only person I can think of who wanted to get into combat was me . RENALDI Some more tea ? You can stop wars . One person at a time . AL COLUMBATO ( Uncomfortable ) You into motors ? p. 14 RENALDI Not regularly . AL COLUMBATO Birdy and me , we were both motor freaks . We did n't give a shit about the cars , but the way the motors worked was magic . My old man bought De Sotos because the mob had an agency in Philly , so with the trade-in , he got them for nothing . Good deal cause he was a plumber and did n't have a dime . We were the only ones on the block who had anything like a new car . ( Split scene : we see YOUNG AL and YOUNG BIRDY under the el again , on their knees listening to the sound of cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and father did n't even know how to drive . ( Sound of car passing ) YOUNG AL COLUMBATO That 's a Ford . 1935 . YOUNG BIRDY ' 34 . AL COLUMBATO Birdy 's father rode to work on the school bus ; he was the janitor there . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Hear those pistons ? Purring like a cat . ( Another car . ) YOUNG AL COLUMBATO What the hell is that ! YOUNG BIRDY Listen to that horsepower . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO That 's immortal . p. 15 YOUNG BIRDY Gear ratio ? YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Ca n't fix it . YOUNG BIRDY Yeah . Yeah . That 's it . It 's an Eight-cylinder engine . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO The whole bridge is vibrating . YOUNG BIRDY 1915 . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO 1915 ? YOUNG BIRDY Stutz Bearcat . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Jesus . YOUNG BIRDY Listening to a motor like that , it 's like you 're floating inside . AL COLUMBATO Only one of it 's kind we ever heard . I used to dream about that car , what it must have looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touring in it , me and Birdy through some fantastic landscape , maybe in some foreign country like France . RENALDI You ought to tell Dr White this stuff . It might make him understand and he 'd be able to help Birdy . AL COLUMBATO Nah . If I came back from wherever Birdy 's gone and saw White standing there in front of me I 'd probably cry the rest of my life . YOUNG BIRDY Al ? YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Yeah ? p. 16 YOUNG BIRDY I finally did it . Jumped off the back porch roof without hurting myself . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Do n't start Birdy . YOUNG BIRDY I hunch myself down , then spring out like a diver with arms spread , then , in mid-air , I pull myself together and push my feet in front of me , just before I hit the ground . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO If you 're going to start vectors and points of impact , I 'll punch you out . YOUNG BIRDY I collapse both against the direction of my jump and the vertical drop . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to absorb the vertical force . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO You 're nuts . YOUNG BIRDY I 'll show you . Let 's go . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO ( He follows . ) Completely nuts . YOUNG BIRDY ( They start to climb down the bridge . ) I 'm building an aviary in my bedroom . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Your Mom 's letting you do that ? YOUNG BIRDY She does n't like it but Dad says if I keep up my grades at school its O K. I 'm gon na get another bird so I need to expand the cage . Want to help ? p. 17 YOUNG AL COLUMBATO I do n't know . YOUNG BIRDY I 'm going to breed them . The one I got I named it Alfonso , after you , cause it 's always looking for a fight . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO As long as you spell it with " P-H " . I 'm the one and only Alfonso with an " F " around here . YOUNG BIRDY Does n't really matter because it is n't his real name anyway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's his real name ? YOUNG BIRDY I do n't know . I do n't know enough canary talk to ask him . ( Beat ) Yet . ( YOUNG AL stares at YOUNG BIRDY . Focus returns to RENALDI and SGT AL in RENALDI 's room . ) AL COLUMBATO You think he 's really a loon ? RENALDI He 's nothing . Guy across the hall there wo n't wear any clothes . Squats in the middle of his cell like your friend here ; but if anybody tries to go in , he shits in his hand and throws it . Boy , he 's fun to feed . More like a zoo than a hospital on this ward . AL COLUMBATO Then why the hell do you stay ? RENALDI I do n't have a choice . I do what they tell me . First I spent some time being starved doing experiments on how little food a person really needs , and then I was up in a forest planting trees . I 've been here the last eighteen months . I guess I feel at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bed sheet , even if it is lying on a bed . You never know when someone might crawl up under it and decide that this C O , sometimes known as Colored Obstacle by the crew here , should have died for his country a long time ago . ( Pause ) How come you call him Birdy ? p. 18 AL COLUMBATO He jumped off a storage tank . Spent about a month in the hospital . It was in all the newspapers about how he 'd fallen from the tank and had n't been killed . There was a picture with a dotted line showing where he 'd jumped from and an X where he landed . Reporters asked me what happened . I never should 've said anything about flying . Then the whole business with the pigeons comes out . By the time he 's back in school they 're calling him Birdy . RENALDI Huh . Might not want to tell White about the nickname . He 'll send him to the real nuthouse for good . So did he jump or what ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have been smashed . When he came out of the hospital he looked even runtier than usual , and pale as a girl . RENALDI You two were real close ? AL COLUMBATO How close is close ? RENALDI I 'm not making any judgments . AL COLUMBATO Nobody else I 've ever known had such a close friend . It was like we were married or something . ( Elsewhere on stage we see YOUNG BIRDY and YOUNG AL with a railroad track between them . It 's very cold . ) YOUNG AL COLUMBATO I do n't believe it Birdy. p. 19 YOUNG BIRDY It 's just science . That 's all . You ca n't beat up science , Al . If you put your tongue onto a frozen railroad track it 'll stick . That 's a scientific fact . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO I know you , Birdy . You think I 'll try it just because you 've said it and then you 'll have a good laugh cause I 'm down on my knees licking railroad tracks for supper . YOUNG BIRDY Let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toilets at school is frozen then the pond will be like rock . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO How much you want to bet . On the tracks . ( He gets down on his knees . ) YOUNG BIRDY Do n't do it , Al . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Sure , sure . ( He ceremoniously sticks out his tongue and onto the tracks . Holding it there he mumbles . ) Da-dum ! ( He tries to pull away . His tongue is stuck . ) YOUNG BIRDY You 're a smart-ass Italian and now you 're down on your knees . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO ( Mumbling ) Shit . YOUNG BIRDY And you 're stuck . Now you 're going to have to pull . ( YOUNG AL tries but his tongue remains stuck. ) p. 20 YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Shit , shit . It hurts . YOUNG BIRDY Why did you do it then ? YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Help me , Birdy . ( Sound of train in distance . Both boys stare in horror in that direction . ) YOUNG AL COLUMBATO I mean it . YOUNG BIRDY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ YOUNG AL COLUMBATO ( Near tears . ) I ca n't . My tongue will come off . ( YOUNG BIRDY tries to help but the tongue wo n't come loose . ) YOUNG BIRDY Would you rather die ? YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Birdy . Help me . Please . YOUNG BIRDY You need hot water to get it loose . We have n't got hot water , Al ! YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Pull ! YOUNG BIRDY No ! ( The train is nearer . ) YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Piss ! YOUNG BIRDY What ? YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Piss . Piss is hot . Piss on my tongue ! YOUNG BIRDY I ca n't piss on your tongue , Al . You 're my friend . p. 21 YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Piss on my tongue or I 'll beat the crap out of you ! YOUNG BIRDY Al ! YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Now ! ( BIRDY opens his fly and the train roars closer . The lights fade on YOUNG AL and YOUNG BIRDY . ) AL COLUMBATO We had a private club for two . From the time I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Birdy than with everybody else put together . Sure , I chased girls and Birdy played with birds but he was actually the only person I was ever close to . People used to say that we sounded alike , our voices I mean . We were always coming out with the same sentences at the same time too . RENALDI Sounds like you loved him . AL COLUMBATO What the hell do you think I 've been saying ? RENALDI I mean loved , like loved him . AL COLUMBATO What you and White want to know is did we get it on together , did we do the hokey-pokey . Does it matter ? No . It does n't matter . ( End Scene Three ) p. 22 Act 1 , Scene 4 Scene Four ( DR WHITE and SGT AL in his office . YOUNG AL lounges elsewhere . ) DR . WHITE Tell me Alfonso , was the patient ever in trouble with the law ? AL COLUMBATO The law , Sir ? ( Pause ) No sir . DR . WHITE I have a police report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlantic City . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Bingo . DR . WHITE and that you spent the night in a cell . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Here we go . AL COLUMBATO We wanted to go to the ocean . I stole a bicycle from one of the shops cause mine broke down . People do that sort of thing when they 're kids , do n't they , sir ? DR . WHITE I did n't . ( Beat ) You were gone three days . Where did the two of you sleep ? AL COLUMBATO On the beach . DR . WHITE On the beach ? Under the stars ? ( SGT AL seems lost in thought . ) DR . WHITE Where they twinkling above you ? p. 23 AL COLUMBATO What , Sir ? DR . WHITE The stars . Were the stars twinkling above you the night you slept on the beach ? AL COLUMBATO I do n't remember stars . It was cold . DR . WHITE I want the truth , Sergeant . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO He wants to know if we jacked each other off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( DR WHITE now looks over SGT AL 's papers . ) DR . WHITE So what type of court-martial was it , Sergeant ? YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Batter up ! AL COLUMBATO Summary , sir . DR . WHITE And what was the offence ? ( No response ) I 'd like you to be frank . AL COLUMBATO Attacking a non-commissioned officer , sir . DR . WHITE Do you get these violent impulses often , Alfonso ? YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Yes , sir . AL COLUMBATO No , sir . Not often , sir . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO All the time . DR . WHITE Would you mind telling me how it happened ? ( SGT AL does not answer. ) p. 24 DR . WHITE I 've ordered your records from Dix . I can read the details myself but I 'd rather hear them from you . ( SGT AL is still silent . ) DR . WHITE As a doctor , Sergeant , it 's my job to . Help you talk . As a representative of the U S military , it 's my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( SGT AL stares at him a moment before speaking . ) AL COLUMBATO Only in the army a few weeks , sir . Corporal at Fort Cumberland grabbed me by the arm and I reacted instinctivelysir . DR . WHITE I see . ( DR WHITE moves to stand behind SGT AL . He breaks his pencil purposely close to SGT AL 's ear . SGT AL jumps and faces off , but quickly recovers . ) AL COLUMBATO Doc , when a person says " I see " , do you think they really see what the other person is talking about , you know , a kind of real detailed picture or is it something bigger ? " I see " kind of being something akin to the ocean . Sea ? ( Beat ) Sir . ( DR WHITE just stares blankly at SGT AL a moment . ) DR . WHITE Tell me , did you enjoy school when you were a child , Alfonso ? p. 25 AL COLUMBATO What ? Yes , I did . We were taught by the Sisters in grade school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your grades ? Did you get distracted easily ? AL COLUMBATO I did alright . Average . Nothing special . Just average . DR . WHITE I 'd sit in the back row , and think about the nuns menstruating away under those long , black , hot , costumes . AL COLUMBATO What made you decide to be a psychiatrist , sir , and work with crazies and loons ? I mean , did you know when you were in high school or did it slip up on you the way things do , sir ? DR . WHITE All my work is n't with abnormals , Alfonso . Many people have some little thing that 's bothering them and I can help them work it out and make their lives better . AL COLUMBATO The army pays for this , sir ? DR . WHITE The army is n't all bad , Sergeant . Fighting wars is never pleasant under any conditions , but the army takes care of its own . AL COLUMBATO It 's certainly taken care of me , sir . DR . WHITE Tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's still alive , sir . p. 26 DR . WHITE ( Looking at his papers ) Sorry , yes . I mean , what is he like ; how do you  --  how did you  --  get along with him ? AL COLUMBATO We were always buddies . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Two kicks in the ass meant he was proud of you . AL COLUMBATO We made model airplanes together . He took me camping . Things like that . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO A box in the ears and a punch in the gut meant he loved you . AL COLUMBATO Great guy . Best mom in the world , too . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO She 'd just close the door and wait ' til it was over . DR . WHITE What does you father do for a living ? AL COLUMBATO Cleans out sewers for the city , sir . He comes in the back way , nights , and scrubs himself with a big laundry scrub brush . He keeps his fingernails so short , you 'd think he bit them . When he comes to eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd been standing in shit all day . AL COLUMBATO We 're poor but clean . ( Beat ) We 're glad to have a chance in this great country of ours , sir . p. 27 YOUNG AL COLUMBATO ( Sings . ) I yam what I yamAnd that 's what I yam ; I 'm Popeye the sailor man:Toot ! ! ! Toot ! ! ! ( DR WHITE just stares at SGT AL . Then split scene : YOUNG AL laughs at DR WHITE 's question , then leaves the office and he and the YOUNG BIRDY are at the ocean . We hear the water and the waves . ) YOUNG BIRDY ( Excited ) Smell it ! Just smell it ! ( He runs up and down . ) Look at the sea gulls !

AL COLUMBATO Yeah . He was always ( Beat ) perfectly normal . YOUNG BIRDY I 'm going to learn to swim . Today . AL COLUMBATO Like me , poor , but from a nice family . And he was good in school . ( BIRDY goes back in the water . ) YOUNG AL COLUMBATO ( Watching BIRDY swim ) You 're supposed to swim on top of the water , not under it ! AL COLUMBATO Not a genius , sir , but he was in the academic curriculum and usually got B 's . YOUNG BIRDY Watch this , Al ! Count how long I can stay under . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Damn it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mississippi-five , Mississippi-six . ( Beat ) Birdy ? Birdy ? ( BIRDY surfaces . Laughing ) YOUNG BIRDY You got ta try it . It 's like flying in water , only thicker and darker . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO I 'm going to get the shit beaten out of me for staying out all night . p. 29 YOUNG BIRDY So what ? Your Dad 'll just beat you up . He ca n't kill you . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Thanks . ( Beat ) Birdy ? While you were in the hospital , after you fell off the tank , it was your mother got rid of the pigeons . The ones we got that night on the tank too . YOUNG BIRDY The pigeons left , Al . They flew away because there was no one to feed them . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Birdy ! YOUNG BIRDY Shut up Al . I 'm trying to learn how to swim . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Right O.K. then , the birds flew away , they headed south . They 're probably in Florida by now . YOUNG BIRDY I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ever . ( Beat ) Hey . Time me . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Yeah ! My old lady 's always complaining about how much I eat ; it 'll save her having to feed me ! O K. Ready ? ( YOUNG AL looks at his watch as SGT AL gets up to leave White 's office . YOUNG BIRDY holds his breath . ) DR . WHITE Was there ever anything about your friend that would give a hint to explain this sudden . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Go ! p. 30 DR . WHITE Complete regressive state ? YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Mississippi-one . Mississippi-two . Mississippi-three . Mississippi-four . ( Becoming anxious . ) Five . Six . Seven . Eight . Birdy ? Nine . Ten . Birdy ! Birdy ! ! ! ( End Scene Four ) p. 31 Act 1 , Scene 5 Scene Five ( SGT AL in BIRDY 's cell/room . There is a window with bars on it to keep BIRDY from escaping . BIRDY is squatting in he middle of the floor . Occasionally he spins in his squat . His hands are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window . ) AL COLUMBATO For a loony bin , it 's awful quiet . ( Beat ) Aw , come on , Birdy . This is Al here , all the way from Dix . Stop it , huh ! ( BIRDY spins . ) AL COLUMBATO Cut it out ! This section eight crap does n't make sense . The stupid war 's over for Christ 's sake ! Hitler , Mussolini , Tojo , the whole shitload ; kaput ! ( BIRDY does n't react . ) AL COLUMBATO Hey , Birdy . You remember when we were kids and we built the pigeon loft up in the tree ? Remember those Greenwood bastards ? They never did find our loft . Shit , there sure were some creeps in our neighborhood . ( Beat ) That was a terrific loft we built . Man , our first flock in your yard was big . There were near ten pairs and two extra cocks . We had all good stock , no junk birds , When we sold that first flock , your mother made us scrape the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to roost . She had the whole porch repainted with our pigeon money . Yeah , Birdy . Your mother was a first class bitch ( Beat ) Ah , come on , Birdy . Get off it , huh ? This is Al . ( Silence some moments . BIRDY 's fingers fold and unfold. ) p. 32 AL COLUMBATO Jesus , you 're pitiful looking . You 're squatting the same way you used to squat when you were sewing feathers on that creepy pigeon suit . If this doctor-major- psychiatrist here ever finds out about that pigeon suit , he 'll sure as hell chain you right to the floor . ( Beat ) How about us up on top of the storage tank . That was wild . That night you almost convinced me you might just be part bird . ( Beat ) Listen here , birdbrain ! I 'm tired of talking to the back of your head ; you ca n't be that crazy ! Maybe if I come in and give you a coupla hard ones you 'll hear better ! ( Beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me and do n't say anything , you really are a loon ; nothing but a fucking loon . ( Pause ) Hey Birdy ! What in the hell did your old lady do with all those baseballs ? ( BIRDY shuffles onto the floor to get closer to the bars in the window a light comes up to show YOUNG BIRDY he stands alone before an aviary that hangs in the air . There is nothing in the cage but we hear a canary . ) YOUNG BIRDY You 're everything I want to be . There 's no room for me here . I 'm alone like you . I want you to love me . I want us to be close , as close as living things can be to each other . How close can we come ? ( He extends some feed to the bird . He tastes some himself and feeds the bird from his own mouth . ) Here . Take it from my lips . That 's it . That 's it . ( Beat ) You 're yellow . The yellow of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) I can smell you . You smell like you fly . Gently . Almost no sound at all . ( He queeps ' again . This queeping should be strange and beautiful . This sound is overwhelmed by the sound of breathing. ) p. 33 ( End Scene Five ) p. 34 Act 1 , Scene 6 Scene Six ( Heavy sound of YOUNG AL breathing as he does sit-ups . YOUNG BIRDY watches him . YOUNG AL looks roughed-up , but his attitude is up-beat . ) YOUNG BIRDY Where 've you been ? YOUNG AL COLUMBATO The old Lady would n't let me out of the house til the worst of the swelling was over . YOUNG BIRDY What did he use this time ? YOUNG AL COLUMBATO His leather belt . Chased me around the cellar , hitting me with it , punching and kicking . The old lady is standing at the top of the cellar steps yelling : ( Mimics his mother . ) Vittorio ! Basta Vittorio ! ! ! YOUNG BIRDY ( Scrutinizing YOUNG AL 's back . ) You 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AL COLUMBATO Finally there 's nothing for it but to roll up in a bundle on the floor and pretend I 'm dead . I just about was . ( Beat ) Nobody 's ever going to get me so they can beat me up like that again . Somehow I 'll get so strong I can beat the crap out of Vittorio , too . ( He does push-up.s . ) YOUNG BIRDY You look like you 've fallen off three gas tanks . p. 35 YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Mostly I 'm sore inside . Old Vittorio is a strong son-of-a-bitch . You wipe big joints and cut six-inch steel pipe all day and you get strong . ( Beat ) I 'm gon na pin the bastard on my eighteenth birthday . ( Gets to his feet ) I can already press over a hundred fifty pounds . I 'm working on muscle control too . I can make a rope with my stomach . Put your hand here . ( YOUNG BIRDY puts his hand on YOUNG AL 's abdomen . ) YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Feel it twist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . Hard . In the stomach . YOUNG BIRDY No thanks . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Go on . Test me . YOUNG BIRDY I got another canary I want you to see . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Hit me ! YOUNG BIRDY I named her Birdy . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO That 's original . Come on . Just once . YOUNG BIRDY No . You feel my arm . ( BIRDY flexes his muscles and YOUNG AL feels his arm . ) YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Not bad . YOUNG BIRDY I 've been building them up for three months now . I 'm almost ready to test this thing.You got to help me. p. 36 YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Yeah , yeah . YOUNG BIRDY I made the whole body out of aluminum tubing , thin aluminum tubes , and bicycle parts . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Just where are you getting this aluminum from Birdy ? In case you have n't heard there 's a war on and we need that stuff to build airplanes for the goddamned war ! YOUNG BIRDY We need to do some practicing . I 've hooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AL COLUMBATO Not your bike . I 'm not doing anything with your bike . Christ , it 's got tubeless tires it 's so old . YOUNG BIRDY It 's the fastest bike in the neighborhood . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO That does n't mean you do n't look like an idiot on it . YOUNG BIRDY When I get going really fast on that bike , I 'm almost separated from the earth , practically free from gravity and friction . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO I 'm not worried about being held down . You are . Tell you what , we 'll do some practicing if you hit me . Just once . With all you got . ( When YOUNG BIRDY wo n't hit him , YOUNG AL goes back to his exercising . ) YOUNG BIRDY They 're amazing , all so different . Each with their own style . Some are called choppers and sing a loud song ; their beaks open , ending each note by closing the beak . Others are called rollers . They sing with beaks closed and deep in the throat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various shapes and sizes . Some are shaped so weird they can hardly fly . ( Beat ) Are you listening , Al ? p. 37 YOUNG AL COLUMBATO ( Quits exercising ) Shit . Yeah . But I should n't be . YOUNG BIRDY One hundred billion birds , fifty for every man alive and nobody seems to notice . Now I like canaries because of the way they fly . Undulating flight . It flies up into an almost stall , then loops down , then up to a stall again and down . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Like Tarzan swinging through the trees but without the vines . YOUNG BIRDY Exactly . It 's the way I 'd like to fly . If I could get close to birds If I could watch birds like watching a movie and become inside them , I 'd know something of it . If I could get close to a bird as a friend and be there when it flies and feel what it 's thinking , then , in a certain way , I would fly . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the cops figure out where you stole this aluminum from . YOUNG BIRDY Do you understand what I mean , Al ? YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Sure . Sure I do . ( End Scene Six ) p. 38 Act 1 , Scene 7 Scene Seven ( RENALDI is getting ready to feed BIRDY . SGT AL stands watching . We now also see the YOUNG BIRDY watching the three of them from a distance . ) AL COLUMBATO Well , Birdy , I 'm here . This is Al and you know it , you bastard . Are you really going to squat there flapping your arms like a baby canary while this guy feeds you ? ( BIRDY looks at him for the first time , for a moment NOT like a bird . RENALDI signals with some cereal and a spoon that SGT AL can feed BIRDY if he wants . RENALDI checks the doors to see if anybody 's looking in .

I do n't believe it . ( BIRDY does n't respond . ) AL COLUMBATO Okay . I 'll feed you anyway . This is ridiculous . If you could see yourself squatting there on the floor and me shoveling this crap down your throat you 'd probably laugh yourself to death . ( SGT AL pushes the food towards BIRDY 's mouth but BIRDY wo n't open his mouth. ) p. 39 AL COLUMBATO Come on , Birdy , open up ! Let mommy put some mush down your throat . It 's good for you . ( BIRDY turns his head away . RENALDI moves in to take over but SGT AL gives him a look to keep him away . ) AL COLUMBATO Look , Birdy . This guy 's giving me a special chance to feed you . Open up ! ( He tries to force the spoon between BIRDY 's lips . It almost becomes a violent act . Then SGT AL quits . ) AL COLUMBATO I know the whole thing is damned undignified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or I feed you . If you 're going to pretend you 're a stupid bird , at least be consistent.O K. Let 's try it like real birds . You do n't like the spoon because you 're a bird , right ? Then I 'll chomp up some of this mush and pass it to you , just like a true-blooded tweetie feeds her chicks , right ? Is n't that what you used to do with your birds ? ( Beat ) Birdy ! ( SGT AL puts a huge spoonful of the cereal into his mouth and chews purposefully . He leans down over the squatting BIRDY and attempts , gently , to pass the cereal into BIRDY 's mouth . BIRDY keeps his mouth shut , then opens it to receive the food . What happens between the two men is almost like a strange , awkward , gentle kiss . After the transmission of the food , SGT AL is silent. ) p. 40 AL COLUMBATO It does n't matter , does it , Birdy ? Is n't that what I heard you say more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'd be burned up about something , at school , or your mother , or my father , and you 'd say : It does n't matter . But then what did ? Besides the birds ? ( Beat ) Those fucking birds . When you were in hospital after you fell off the tank , you thought your birds flew away cause no one fed them . Your birds did n't fly anywhere . Did you know that ? I came by your house that week one after noon when you were laid up , to check on your birds . I found your mom shoveling them into a garbage can ; she poisoned them . All twenty-five of them . That was the only time I ever lied to you . ( Beat ) You know what 's going to happen to you ? They 're going to keep you locked up like this all your life . I bet there are hospitals all over the country filled up with war nuts . ( Beat ) Birdy . I know you 're not hurting anybody . Trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably go jump off some high building or try to fly down a staircase or out a window or something . What the hell , if that 's what you want to do they should let you . You never were dumb , Birdy . Most things you did made sense . In a way . But I do n't know about this stuff . Are you crazy , Birdy ? ( YOUNG BIRDY turns away from the men and makes " queeping " noises. ) p. 41 AL COLUMBATO But hell , what 's crazy ? Wars are crazy for sure . ( The light fades out on SGT AL , BIRDY and RENALDI . YOUNG AL enters YOUNG BIRDY 's space . ) YOUNG AL COLUMBATO You know what they say about the bird freak at school these days ? YOUNG BIRDY It 's no good I 'm not going , Al . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Most likely to suck-seed . ( Beat ) Only three days left till the showdown . YOUNG BIRDY Look at the two of them . Have you ever seen anything more perfect ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prom . ( Picking up some drawings YOUNG BIRDY 's done of birds ) AL COLUMBATO Hey . These are pretty good . Better than what we saw at the Franklin last week . YOUNG BIRDY That 's because most artists draw birds from stuffed birds . A dead bird is n't a bird anymore ; it 's like trying to draw fire by looking at ashes . AL COLUMBATO They got any eggs yet ? YOUNG BIRDY I 'm still waiting for them to mate . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Speaking of mating , there 's about twenty girls who want to go to the prom but have nobody stupid enough to take them . p. 42 YOUNG BIRDY My mother is getting hysterical . It 's some kind of personal insult to her that I do n't want to go out and rent a tux for five dollars , buy an orchid for a dollar and a half to pin on some girl I hardly know . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO How about this : Doris Robinson ! YOUNG BIRDY So what . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO She 's dying to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy her own corsage . She drives and can get her dad 's car . YOUNG BIRDY Once they mate , the female lays within four days . I have to watch them all the time . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO All you have to do is rent the tux . Doris has got great legs . YOUNG BIRDY I 've tried watching girl 's legs . They all look the same to me . One has a bit more flesh here or there , one has more wrinkly knees than another or more or less bony ankles . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO ( Interrupts ) Birdy . This is Doris we 're talking about . Not only legs but ass , real ass . YOUNG BIRDY A woman 's ass is only an over development of the gluteus maximus , to make it possible for people to walk on two legs , and sit down . To me , anything sitting down is ugly . p. 43 YOUNG AL COLUMBATO You ca n't say the same about tits . YOUNG BIRDY Look , you 've showed me the difference between good tits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volume and pointedness . Not much different from what a goat or a cow has ; just a bit more inconvenient . Al . She 's an ordinary girl with regular legs , regular ass , and slightly more than regular tits . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO You can make it with this girl . I know two guys who had her . YOUNG BIRDY Doris does n't look as if she could ever fly under any conditions . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO You 're going , Birdy . YOUNG BIRDY Between you and my mother , it looks like I 've got no choice . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO You 'll thank me one day . YOUNG BIRDY I 'm not carrying any crappy orchid.They smell like death . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Have you ever even kissed a girl ? YOUNG BIRDY Yes I have . They stick their tongue into your mouth , it 's like sucking in a bubble gum wad . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO It 's great , is n't it ?

If they stopped , I probably would n't be able to sleep at night . DR . WHITE Tell me , are you afraid of people , Alfonso ? AL COLUMBATO People ? No reason to be . DR .

WHITE Oh , is that what it is ? ( Beat ) This report on the incident at New Cumberland indicates that you were in the army only five days at the time ; is that true ? AL COLUMBATO Yes , sir . DR . WHITE It says you knocked out eight of the non-commissioned officer 's teeth and broke his nose ? YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Seven teeth . Not eight , you bozo . DR . WHITE Was he being unfair to you , Alfonso ? YOUNG AL COLUMBATO I got down on my hands and knees and counted them . DR . WHITE You 're a non-com yourself now .

WHITE Your friend will be shipped to an asylum if there 's no progress , Sergeant . Every hour , on the hour , his treatment is costing the army money , money that could better be spent developing a new class of tanks . Your interaction with the patient , your information on his character has had no effect . You 're dismissed . AL COLUMBATO Sir . There 's one thing I know has always bothered the patient . He lived just over the left-center field fence of our local baseball park . Whenever anybody hit a ball over that fence for a home run , his mother used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everybody hated her for it . The patient felt terrible about this . Used to apologize to everybody and swear he 'd get the balls back . He kept lists of all the people his mother had taken balls from . He spent hours looking for them in his house , in the attic , everywhere . Maybe if you could get his mother to send those balls down here it would help . I know it would take a big load off his mind and it might be just the thing to help him remember . DR . WHITE ( Writing in his notepad ) How long ago was this , Sergeant ? AL COLUMBATO Oh , it went on for years , sir . Seven years at least . There must be an awful lot of baseballs in that collection , sir . ( DR WHITE studies SGT AL. ) p. 48 DR .

WHITE All right . I 'll see what I can do . And Sergeant , work on dropping the anger routine . I realize you blame the army , and therefore myself , for what 's happened to your friend . That 's perfectly natural . It 's also tiresome . All you really need to do is open up your mouth and spill what you know . Just sit on the pot and shit .

You scrambled up the top of the falls with me pushing you up from behind . Then I slipped and whoosh , down the falls I went , turning and spinning , thumping over the ice bumps . But I was n't hurt . You said the pond up there was beautiful . Clear and slick as a mirror with no reeds growing through the ice and bigger than the millpond . I just had to see it so I tried again . You got down on your stomach and leaned out over the edge of the falls to give me a hand . You started pulling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stick to the ice .

I was working in one of the flight cages when it first came to me . I 'd put all the birds into the breeding cages and there were already eleven nests built and over thirty eggs had been laid .

( Beat ) In my dream , I 'd been living in this flight cage with the other males . I could talk to them . I made sounds like a bird . I ate seed .

( He opens his shirt and feels his body . ) One thing I know now is that flying is n't anything like swimming . It is n't all pushing down , catching air under the wings and pushing against it .

( Beat ) Why did you say that ? AL COLUMBATO I do n't know . DR . WHITE Was that what you used to call him ? AL COLUMBATO No . I do n't know why I said it . DR . WHITE Really ? ( Beat ) Sergeant , would you mind going into more detail about this court-martial you had at Fort Cumberland ? What actually happened ? p. 62 AL COLUMBATO I do n't see what that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all happened a long time ago . DR . WHITE I 'll decide that , Sergeant . ( As a warning ) Talk . AL COLUMBATO I was in the Pennsylvania State Guard and in December they sent me to Fort Cumberland for induction and reassignment into the regular army . DR . WHITE Go on . AL COLUMBATO As I told you , sir , I was just doing my job digging coal and I guess I was n't digging fast enough when this T-5 grabbed my shoulder . So I hit him . With my shovel . DR . WHITE I want the whole story . The details . ( Split scene : YOUNG BIRDY and YOUNG AL . They are on the ice , near the spot they fell though . ) AL COLUMBATO It 's a cold day . My feet are freezing and my nose is about to drop off . We 're all shoveling . The coal 's frozen so hard we almost ca n't get the shovels in for the first few bites , we have to kick them in . We work for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my Sicilian laugh wo n't work , I 'm so damn froze . ( YOUNG BIRDY ca n't get his breath . YOUNG AL pumps the water out of YOUNG BIRDY . Then YOUNG BIRDY sits up. ) p. 63 YOUNG AL COLUMBATO ( Jumping up and down ) Get your blood moving , Birdy ! We got to get back to the fire . ( YOUNG BIRDY tries to move about but he 's too weak . ) YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Wring out your socks . Before they freeze . ( They take off their boots and wring out their socks . ) YOUNG BIRDY The water 's still in my lungs . I can feel it . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Put your boots back on . We got to hurry . ( They try to put their boots back on but ca n't . ) YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Shit ! My feet are swelled up . I ca n't get my boots back on . ( YOUNG BIRDY has already given up . ) YOUNG AL COLUMBATO We 'll have to run back down the creek bed barefoot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathe right . ( He starts to cough and ca n't get his breath . ) I got to rest . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO We have to run . If we stop moving we 'll freeze . Birdy ! YOUNG BIRDY I 'm tired . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Do n't you fucking pass out on me. p. 64 YOUNG BIRDY My ears feel like they 're filled with snow . ( He tries to get up but ca n't . ) YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Shit . ( He picks YOUNG BIRDY up and throws him over his back in a fireman 's carry . YOUNG BIRDY has passed out . YOUNG AL runs . ) AL COLUMBATO I 'm going as fast as I can but this T-5 keeps at me . Calling me every dirty thing he can think of . I 'm trying to show the bastard up . I 'm digging hard , tilting up a full shovel load and really swinging back to get it all in the truck . And then he grabs my arm . Again . He curses at me . I say ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes for it again. I step back about two steps to the edge of the coal pile and swing from the hips . God , I 've got to say , it feels good ! I catch him flush in the face , straight on , flat out ! The T-5 's feet go out from under him and he 's on his back in the coal pile . He starts to get up , then falls back again . His face looks blurred , as if somebody pulled a silk stocking over it . At first it 's white . Then the blood starts . And the snow just soaks it up . ( Beat ) I did n't think a shovel could do that to a face . DR . WHITE That 's the whole story , Sergeant ? AL COLUMBATO Yes , sir . After I hit him , I was confined to quarters and three days later I had a summary court-martial . They went easy on me and I was only reprimanded . But it was written into my service record , and they shipped me out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a way to begin an army career , sir . ( YOUNG AL is carrying YOUNG BIRDY into BIRDY 's home . YOUNG AL puts him down and slaps him gently to bring him around. ) p. 65 YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Come back to me , Birdy . Do n't you fucking go . Birdy ? ( Calls ) Anybody home ? ( Beat ) Walk , Birdy . You got to walk . DR . WHITE Did you ever hit or use violence withBirdy ? AL COLUMBATO ( Wo n't be caught out . ) With who ? DR . WHITE With the patient , damn it . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO You ca n't sleep . I 'm going to put you in a hot bath . AL COLUMBATO No , sir . We were friends . DR . WHITE It seems there was more to it than that , Sergeant . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Can you hear me ? AL COLUMBATO I said we were friends . I never hit him . ( YOUNG AL begins to remove the shirt of the almost unconscious YOUNG BIRDY as DR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beat you excessively ? AL COLUMBATO I 've already answered that . DR . WHITE Do you have some deep feeling of being hurt ? YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Birdy , can you hear me ? p. 66 AL COLUMBATO No . I do n't . DR . WHITE Do you have any idea , Alfonso , why you 've been a victim to these aggressive , hostile impulses ? AL COLUMBATO ( Shouting ) No . I said no . Can you hear me ? ( Silence . YOUNG AL lifts YOUNG BIRDY and carries him to the bath . ) YOUNG AL COLUMBATO If you die , I 'm going to beat the crap out of you . ( End Scene Two ) p. 67 Act 2 , Scene 3 Scene Three ( SGT AL in the ward getting ready to feed BIRDY ) AL COLUMBATO Hey Birdy remember that time we fell through the ice and you came out of it without even a cold but I practically got pneumonia ? I was at home for three weeks . ( Suddenly he is angry . ) I saved your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there on the ice . And what for ? It does n't matter , does it because in the end you let them lay a big egg inside your head and then you just sat down to roost ! Look at yourself . You 're just a piece of junk . No better than the rest of us . Though I bet you think so , huh ? You think a bird is more dignified . Well let me tell you something . When a bird gets scared it just flies away so you see it 's always missing the best part . Every bird 's a coward at heart . You hear me ? Just a stinking coward . ( BIRDY 's arms slowly come away from his sides . He looks at them , uncurls his fists and feebly wiggles the fingers . He looks at SGT AL and reaches for the bowl and spoon . He puts them in BIRDY 's hands as BIRDY stares at SGT AL . After some time BIRDY shifts the spoon a few times in his hand as if trying to remember . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the bowl together . He misses twice , then gets the spoon in the mush and stirs it a long time . Finally he lifts the spoon out of the dish and puts it in his mouth . He has a hard time getting the spoon out of his mouth because he bites down on it . He is learning to eat again. ) p. 68 AL COLUMBATO I 'm just starting to figure it out , Birdy . Just how far away we 've been . ( Beat ) It 's a long way back , a long way for us to come . ( End Scene Three ) p. 69 Act 2 , Scene 4 Scene Four ( YOUNG AL running frightened to meet YOUNG BIRDY , who is unbuckling his wings . He is soaking wet . ) YOUNG AL COLUMBATO You okay , Birdy ? YOUNG BIRDY Yeah , I 'm fine . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO That 's what you said after you fell of the gas tank . You sure you 're okay ? YOUNG BIRDY Sure I 'm sure . When you only weigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you have as much air surface as I did . I did n't come down fast at all . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Well I practically broke my neck sliding down the dump hill . I scared the bejesus out of a rat . YOUNG BIRDY ( Adjusting a few vanes that got bent . ) Let 's try it again . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO You 're going to get yourself killed and I do n't want to be there for it . YOUNG BIRDY You can fall off a curb and kill yourself if you do n't know what you 're doing . I know what I 'm doing . It 's all dependent on weight and surface and density , and more than that , knowing you can do it . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Hey , your mother 's out . Let 's head back to your house and look for the baseballs. p. 70 YOUNG BIRDY You know what I think went wrong , Al ? I 've been doing all this working out on the sawhorse and I forgot I need to keep my body stiff in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea . YOUNG BIRDY I need to make some kind of brace to go under my stomach that I can arch against . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Okay , but wait a few days . You need to straighten that thing out in all the right places . Right now , let 's get a shovel for the basement . And dig behind the door . ( End Scene Four ) p. 71 Act 2 , Scene 5 Scene Five ( RENALDI and SGT AL in RENALDI 's room . RENALDI is excited . ) RENALDI He fed himself . This is a breakthrough . We 've got to tell White . AL COLUMBATO What the hell will White do except write it in his papers and file it in some moldy drawer . Ca n't we keep it to ourselves ? RENALDI I do n't know . Maybe it 's better for the patient if the doctor decides . AL COLUMBATO No . No way . RENALDI What 's with you ? AL COLUMBATO Maybe I 'm not so sure I want Birdy to come back , okay ? RENALDI That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have another operations on my face next week . That means I 'll have to leave here and Birdy will be alone . RENALDI How 's it feeling ? AL COLUMBATO Hurts just the same . RENALDI Let me take a look . ( He gently examines the bandages and adjusts them . ) AL COLUMBATO I 'll only be staying around another day or two . If I stay any longer , they 'll probably lock me up in one of these rooms . p. 72 RENALDI You 're going to look pretty good is my guess . AL COLUMBATO I do n't know what White 'll do if he ever gets a real good look in my head . Birdy 's advantage is White still has n't figured out that he 's a bird . When he does , Birdy 's in trouble . RENALDI And then what ? He 'll put him in some kind of giant birdcage , with perches , feeding cups and everything ? Keep him in a cage and lecture on the " bird boy " ? AL COLUMBATO Exactly . RENALDI Al @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll deck him out in a bird costume . Ten thousand canaries will have to be defeathered to make this costume . Birdy will hop from perch to perch , do some peeping and maybe warble a few songs for the public . RENALDI He 'll be an international success ! He 'll get all the birdseed he can eat ! AL COLUMBATO Is it so crazy ? RENALDI He 's not a bird . AL COLUMBATO I do n't know what he is anymore . I do n't even know what 's left of him . Or of me . Maybe I 'm the bird . Maybe we 're all birds and we 've got Birdy locked in there because he 's the only one left whose human . RENALDI God . It 'd be great , would n't it ? ; just to let go and stop pretending ; to let it all out . p. 73 AL COLUMBATO To punch holes in the walls . ( He hollers , then gives a Tarzan yell . ) RENALDI To run up and down the walls ! AL COLUMBATO To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Jesus , that 'd be great ! RENALDI What keeps us from doing it ? We could do it if we really wanted to . Nobody could blame us . We 've been hurt enough . AL COLUMBATO We ? You 've been hurt ? ( Laughs ) Yeah ? When ? You hung back on your moral laurels and played it safe . RENALDI Is that what you think it 's like here ? AL COLUMBATO Yeah . I do . Sticking it out here with the crazies , spooning the goons with mush while we 're busting our buts in the trenches . You 've been hurt ? Like what ? With your flesh ? Like this ? ( He punches the wall a few hard times in quick succession . ) Or like this ? ( He hits himself , hard , in the face . ) RENALDI I do n't have to watch this . AL COLUMBATO Yes you do . There 's a difference between people like me and Birdy and people like you . We 've been knocked to hell and back . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have . All the time and not just in black and white . No , All see it everywhere everyday . In full color . I do n't need to cross the ocean or fire a gun to see war . Its here all around me . ( RENALDI gets in SGT AL 's face . ) RENALDI I 'm looking at it right now . ( End Scene Five ) p. 75 Act 2 , Scene 6 Scene Six ( YOUNG BIRDY and YOUNG AL in BIRDY 's bedroom YOUNG AL is doing pushups . ) YOUNG BIRDY ( Sings ) Down is up.Up is sky.Sing a songDo n't ask why . You know , Al . To bend a tree or fill a sail is nothing . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Shhhh . I 'm counting . YOUNG BIRDY Knowledge only , not knowing . A bird knows the air without knowledge . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO ( Quits push-ups ) It smells in here , Birdy.No wonder your Mom complains . YOUNG BIRDY From two birds , I got eighteen birds . One of the young ones , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perta . Her name is Perta . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO A bird shits every three minutes . You got eighteen birds shitting every three minutes . You need some fresh air . YOUNG BIRDY Come here , take a look at her . Perta watches me . She tells me I 'm a bird . That I 'm to forget all this nonsense about being a boy . She wants me as her mate . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO You ca n't date a bird . ( Beat ) Jesus , Birdy.This is getting to be too much . You do n't even have any friends left . p. 76 YOUNG BIRDY None except for that wop up on Radburn Road . That Alfonso . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Al . It 's Al . YOUNG BIRDY I know what it 's like to fly . When I 'm asleep , in my dream I can fly . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Yeah , well you should try some other kinds of flying . When I 'm with Lucy , I fly too . Totally dumb but she 's got strong legs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full split . That 's her specialty as a cheerleader . Break your heart to see her do it . YOUNG BIRDY The first time I heard Alfonso sing I thought it was water running . Then the sound increased until it turned into one long rolling note . After that long roll , unbroken in volume and pitch , he broke into three almost sobbing , soft , drawn-out melodious notes . Those three notes were enough to break your heart . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO They 're just birds . YOUNG BIRDY And when he flies , it 's like an act of personal creation , of defiance . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO I do n't know . YOUNG BIRDY No one knows more than they have to know . All of us are locked in gravity graves . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Do me a favor , Birdy . ( He raises his shirt. ) p. 77 YOUNG BIRDY ( Realizing that YOUNG AL has hardly been listening ) You hardly ever come around anymore , Al . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Hit me . YOUNG BIRDY We used to be friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AL COLUMBATO Come on . YOUNG BIRDY No . We used to be best friends . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Birdy . YOUNG BIRDY Why do n't you come around anymore ? YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Hit me . YOUNG BIRDY ( Turns back to his birds and sings ) Touch the airHold it tight.Stroke the windRide the light . ( Al stands there , with shirt still raised , watching BIRDY sing . ) YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Hit me . ( Suddenly YOUNG BIRDY attacks him and pins him on the ground . ) YOUNG BIRDY No . ( Raining blows on YOUNG AL in a frenzy . ) I wo n't hit you ! I 'm not your old man , Al . I 'm your friend . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Get the fuck off me. p. 78 YOUNG BIRDY Your old man hits you , not me . I do n't . He hits you . I do n't hit you . He does . ( YOUNG BIRDY strikes him . ) He hits you all the time . He hits you like that . ( YOUNG BIRDY hits YOUNG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) YOUNG BIRDY He hits you like this . And like that . Is that what you want me to do to you ? Hit you . And hit you . Until you turn into a piece of Italian leather so tough and thick you wo n't feel anything anymore . Is that what you want ? ( All the while YOUNG BIRDY is hitting and kicking YOUNG AL , who does not fight back . ) YOUNG BIRDY To become just like him ? Stop it , Al . Just stop it . ( YOUNG BIRDY stops hitting YOUNG AL . He stares at his friend who lies in a fetus position on the floor with his arms protecting his head . Silence ) YOUNG BIRDY It does n't matter , though . Does it ? The earth turns and we 're caught . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO You 're crazy , Birdy . YOUNG BIRDY We just keep getting pulled down . The earth in us is too strong . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Fucking crazy . YOUNG BIRDY Yeah . It 's all I got left . ( End @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scene Seven ( SGT AL with BIRDY in the Ward . SGT AL sits in a chair and watches BIRDY . BIRDY is still squatting but his arms are now folded over his chest . YOUNG BIRDY watches his birdcage in the background . ) AL COLUMBATO I 'm gone in a couple of days , Birdy . They 're gon na take off the bandages soon . I 'm not sure what they 'll find under there . The doctor at Dix put some skin from my ass on my chin . Got a match ? Yeah , my face and my ass . I wo n't be able to grow a beard . I 've got enough hair on my ass , more hair than most people have on their faces but it wo n't help . And now I 'm going to have a bald patch on my ass as well . ( Beat ) You know , Birdy , this is really a fucked-over situation . I have the feeling we have n't had anything to do with making our own lives . We 're just examples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're a little bit different , but in the end we were as usable as everybody else . They put some clothes on us , give us a rifle , teach us some tricks and then we 're just names on a company roster , somebody to schedule for K P or guard duty or patrol . They finish us off with a discharge or put us on a casualty list or whatever happens and it does n't matter who we are or were . ( Beat ) You know , Birdy , your old lady actually sent all those baseballs here . Having them sent was my idea . I hope you do n't mind . I told White it might help you come around . ( Beat ) Think of it . She must have had those baseballs all the time . Remember how we 'd search , watching to see if she came home . Renaldi says they 're moldy so she must have buried them . ( He sits silently and watches BIRDY . ) Remember that song you used to sing to the pigeons , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make you laugh Birdy ? You know I ca n't sing . Okay , I warned you . Here I go . ( He sings , awkwardly but with a strange beauty . ) How is it I know you , strange one ? In what untrammeled sky did we fly ? Perhaps I was the air and youthe bird . Did you fly through me ? p. 80 YOUNG BIRDY ( Sings . ) Perhaps I was the air and you the bird . Did you fly through me ? ( The focus switches as YOUNG BIRDY begins to undress as he circles the birdcage . ) My strength as a bird spreads through me . The blood is circulating in warmth out to the tips of my feather , to the ends of my toenails . There is a transfer of feeling between us , a knowing that I have never known , never even dreamed of dreaming.You are alive to me . I fly after you . And now you stop and you wait for me . You wait , cup yourself to receive me . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower myself into you . For just that moment , I am not alone , not separate . ( He embraces the cage as though he were going to make love to it . ) I am engulfed by your whole being . ( His body shudders with both pleasure and pain . ) AL COLUMBATO I left you alone . It 's pointless to say it now , but I 'm sorry . It was all getting too weird . I had to get away . And that meant you too , Birdy . Getting away from you . ( End Scene Seven ) p. 81 Act 2 , Scene 8 Scene Eight ( SGT AL and RENALDI are alone together . SGT AL is worn out . ) RENALDI Sounds . Tough . Really tough .

RENALDI Best friend gave up on him . Epilogue . AL COLUMBATO Renaldi . I know you think you 're the moral code around here cause you would n't kill a fly if it missiled down your nose , but this is out of your reach . You 're a nurse . You feed and clean . Stick to what you know . RENALDI Yeah , I 'm the nurse . I spoon your food . I wipe your ass when your dreams scare the shit out of you . I sing to you when you 're sad . I clap for you when you 're hopeful . I 'm the cheerleader for the sad-sack boys back from the war . Only most of you wo n't look me in the face ' cause I 've seen the places where you 're broken .

RENALDI ( Laughs . ) Yeah . About as tough as your life is gon na be from here on out if you leave your friend perched up in that tree . AL COLUMBATO ( Somewhat embarrassed ) So . You 've . Heard me at night ? RENALDI Yeah . Want me to do a good imitation ? ( Inhales and poses , as though to do a huge , long scream . ) AL COLUMBATO No . No thanks .

WHITE You 've had a lot of time , Sergeant . I 'm ready to try something else . AL COLUMBATO I know I 'm reaching him . DR . WHITE How do you know that ? AL COLUMBATO I just know it . It 's something I can  --  YOUNG AL &amp; SGT AL ( Overlapping ) I can feel . DR . WHITE Well , Sergeant , it 's not something I can see . He actually seems to be getting worse . He 's less mobile , less willing to be fed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ YOUNG AL COLUMBATO That 's something ! DR . WHITE I 'm sorry but I 've already made arrangements to have him shipped to the base in Florida . They 're better equipped to deal with this sort of thing than we are here .

Extreme treatments are what 's needed now . Something electrical , perhaps . There 's also a new chemical they can inject straight into the skull . AL COLUMBATO Give me one more day . DR . WHITE No . All this soft talk has lead us nowhere . ( Split scene : we see YOUNG BIRDY elsewhere on stage , lying naked and paralyzed next to his birdcage . ) AL COLUMBATO Just twenty-four hours . DR .

WHITE ( Interrupts ) It seems to me , Sgt. , that you 're getting emotionally involved in all this in a way that could actually be harmful to the patient and to yourself . AL COLUMBATO Harmful ? What are you talking about ? I 'm begging you , Sir . One more day . DR . WHITE You 're a Sergeant . You should n't beg . Look , I realize that he was your friend , Sergeant . But that was a long time ago . He 's not the same person . He 's something else now altogether and neither of us can help him . AL COLUMBATO You hate him , do n't you ? DR . WHITE You 're dismissed . YOUNG AL &amp; SGT AL ( Simultaneously ) Listen to me . AL COLUMBATO Please . DR . WHITE I said you 're dismissed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . DR . WHITE What did you say , Sergeant ? YOUNG AL COLUMBATO No , damn it . AL COLUMBATO I said : No , sir . p. 86 DR . WHITE ( Picks up the phone . SGT AL grabs his arm . ) This could be described as attacking an officer . Is that what you want ? AL COLUMBATO I want my friend back . ( DR WHITE shakes SGT AL 's hand off his arm . ) . DR . WHITE It 's not your friend I hate , Sergeant . It 's the cowardice at your core . Personal responsibility is meaningless to you . But you 're not alone . In my experience too many soldiers pick up a gun without the least notion of what it means to fight for something larger than the two hundred pounds of meat still slung on their bones . One out of four . Let me say that again , only one out of four men who charges into battle ever fires his gun . The other three never pull the trigger . Not because they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what this culture has done to our boys , made them worship their own flesh before their country 's honor . We 're a nation of the spiritually bankrupt . We no longer serve with grace . As for myself , serving with grace is going to war without a thought for one 's own well being . Grace has nothing to do with whimpering , snivelling soldiers . Grace is a bullet out the barrel of a gun . Grace is a missile splitting clouds . Grace is the United States military in all its enormous , righteous , wonderous , blistering motion . What grace is not , what grace is no longer a part of , Sergeant , is you . Nor that spiritless , vacated friend of yours you do n't even have the courage to abandon . ( YOUNG AL turns lets out an anquished cry , and in his anger hits the desk or wall . At the same time SGT AL turns and slaps DR WHITE in the face .

Even when I 'm asleep and do n't know it . DR . WHITE What do you want from me , Sergeant ? AL COLUMBATO Twenty-four hours . Nothing more . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO ( To SGT AL , who looks directly at YOUNG AL for the first time . ) Twenty-four hours . Nothing more ? What the hell are you saying ? AL COLUMBATO ( To YOUNG AL ) There 's nothing else I can do . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO ( Shouting at SGT AL ) Fuck you . I want my friend back . ( YOUNG AL and SGT AL lock eyes . ) DR .

We still see YOUNG BIRDY by his birdcage . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pal , Al . How about it ? You ready to talk yet ? ( He pushes BIRDY . ) AL COLUMBATO Remember who I am , you son of a bitch ? If you stay back there in that fake birdbrain of yours , they have it all worked out , you 'll be written into some budget as a loss and now we 've only got twenty-four hours . Just the two of us . Bird man and Big-shot Al . More like Big-shit . Wonder how a guy like me got to be Sergeant , huh ? ( He pushes BIRDY harder , and BIRDY backs away in his squat . ) AL COLUMBATO Huh ? No , I bet you do n't , but you 're gon na hear it . ( Beat ) By the time we get into Germany , I find out that I get more scared than most people do of things I ca n't do nothing about ; things like artillery . Little punks , guys afraid to look anybody in the eye can sit under fire in a hole with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They 're scared but they can live with it . I do n't know how to be scared with dignity . I 'm scared deep into my bones about being mangled . My fucking love for my own body wipes me out . I get to a point where I 'm even scared of being scared . Big-shot Al is spending his time trying not to crap his pants , literally . Breathing deep , trying not to stutter . Every time I get up the nerve to turn myself in , go psycho , take my section eight , we 're off the line and I try to put myself together again . My hands shake so much I can hardly load a clip . The only way I can see to get out of all this is to get hit . I 'm so fucking scared my asshole has n't felt anything solid slide past it in three months . I 'll probably never take a normal crap again . ( BIRDY has turned and is looking hard at the window. ) p. 89 AL COLUMBATO Just what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see some of the things I see ? Is that why you 're a squawker instead of a talker now ? ( Beat ) Ever see your squad leader kneel down in five separate pieces in front of you ? Kind of changes a person . ( He squats in front of BIRDY and touches BIRDY 's face , gently . ) AL COLUMBATO One time I 'm lying face down in the mud . Praying . Praying real hard so I wo n't get hit when something lands on my head . Lands so lightly , gently , that I think it 's a bird . I pray it 's a bird . I 'm sure I can hear it singing . But it is n't a bird . It 's an ear . And it is n't even mine . ( Beat ) And then , then the guy next to me gets his whole face wiped off and pulled to one side like a mask . I take hold of the skin of his face and try to wrap it across , into place again . It feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit . I say to him " Do n't touch your face ! You 're hit in the face ! " But he does n't even have a face left to touch . And something breaks inside me but I just keep on going , keep taking orders , like everybody else . I make a great lemming . Until I 'm hit . And I 'm so happy when I get hit that I start crying . It 's like going to sleep and it feels so good to just let go . ( Beat ) In the hospital they do a bunch of operations . On my stomach and my face . I do n't care . I like operations now . They can cut me up a little at a time ; only no pain , please . Take my lovely , muscular body and hack away . But no shocks , no sudden pain , no dirt , no attacks , no patrols ; I ca n't take it . ( Beat ) I just could n't take it . ( Beat ) I 'm finished with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've made Sergeant . They wo n't say why . Anyone who gets torn up enough makes Sergeant ? Then they tell me about you , Birdy . They say you 're down in Kentucky and they want me to go talk to you . I do n't want to . I do n't want to see anybody who knew me the way I used to be . ( Beat ) All my life I 've been building a personal picture of myself like body building in Strength and Health . Only I did n't build it from the inside , I built it from the outside , to keep things out . Now a big part of this crazy structure is torn apart and I have to start all over . I 'll probably wind up putting together the old Al with some pieces missing and plaster it over somehow . ( Beat ) I 've got to learn to live with fear . It 's built in and there 's no sense fighting it . But I ca n't say this to your old lady ; she 's crying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baseball crook is crying . I tell her I 'll go . I come down here and I start talking to you about how it was with us and you 're some kind of freaky bird looking out the window . ( Beat ) Hell , you 're not even listening now . What 's the use ? What 's the use of anything ? We were too close , Birdy ; we were too much to each other . And now you 're gone , you bastard . You 're right here . Right beside me . But you 're gone . And I just ca n't make it back . ( SGT AL gives up , turns away from BIRDY and puts his head in his hands . He seems completely lost . When he looks up again , BIRDY is standing up and looking straight at SGT AL. ) p. 90 BIRDY Well , Al . You 're just as full of shit as ever . ( The focus changes to BIRDY 's room . YOUNG BIRDY still by birdcage . YOUNG AL enters . ) YOUNG BIRDY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been selected to study engineering with the Army Specialized Training program . I 'd forgotten I 'd taken the test . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Yeah . I 'll be gone before you are . I leave next week . My parents are happy I 'm getting the hell out of the house . YOUNG BIRDY Mine think I 'm going to be an officer and that impresses them . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO The army is n't going to let you keep canaries , that 's for sure . YOUNG BIRDY Al . In this last dream , it 's me , a boy flying . Alfonso was at the head of the flock . We flew straight south over Landsdowne , over Chester . But somehow I could n't keep up ; They were leaving me , and then I was falling , gliding down to earth and I just managed to get back into my sleep . In the morning , I went to the aviary . I let the birds go . That night I did n't dream and I have n't dreamt since . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that dream . Ever again . YOUNG BIRDY When you talk to me your mouth moves . p. 91 YOUNG AL COLUMBATO It 's supposed to . YOUNG BIRDY ( Touches Al 's face . ) Yeah . I guess it is , but it 's so beautiful . How come ? ( YOUNG AL takes a step back . ) YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Knock it off , Birdy . YOUNG BIRDY I never really looked at your face before . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Get your shoes on . Let 's go out to the track . I 'm gon na be a winner this time . YOUNG BIRDY You were last time . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Because Al Columbato believes in himself and if you got that , nothing can turn you upside down . YOUNG BIRDY I do n't want to go to war , Al . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO I do . YOUNG BIRDY I do n't want to carry a gun . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Damn it , I do ! BIRDY Could we sign up for the same unit ? YOUNG AL COLUMBATO No . YOUNG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't want you with me . I 'm going over there to win myself some medals . Do n't you get it ? This is a war . It 's got nothing to do with your stupid birds . ( YOUNG AL leaves YOUNG BIRDY alone . Focus moves to SGT AL and BIRDY in the cell . BIRDY is physically more agile than we 'd exspect him to be , but he 's not yet completely lucid. ) p. 92 AL COLUMBATO Birdy ! Jesus . You okay ? BIRDY I 'm not okay , Al . But it 's me . AL COLUMBATO What about all that bird shit ? Do n't tell me you 've been pretending all this time or I 'll kill you barehanded ! BIRDY That 's right , Al . I was pretending . I pretended I was a bird . Now I 'm pretending I 'm me . I figured it out while you were talking . I think I 'm me now . That 's not completely true either . I do n't know who I am but I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's something . ( Beat ) What the hell happened to you anyway ? How did you wind up here ? BIRDY I got hit going into Waiheke Island . I wake up . I 'm in a hot tent and the sun is making everything yellow . There are long rows of cots . People are running past , I hear rifle fire . There 's a noise at the far end of the tent . It 's a Japanese soldier . He goes down the line of cots . There 's no screaming , only the thump of his rifle and the tear of the cot as his bayonet stabs through each time . I crawl under the edge of the tent and start to run . Then I run and run until I ca n't run anymore . And then , I just . Begin to fly . AL COLUMBATO Birdy ! BIRDY I fly past the Japanese , over the tent , and into the jungle . I look back and see the tent on the edge of the sand and the water glistening , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! BIRDY And the next thing I know I 'm here listening to you talk about pigeons . AL COLUMBATO What do you really think happened ? BIRDY That 's what happened , Al . AL COLUMBATO Why 'd it take you so long to come around ? BIRDY I guess did n't have anything to come back to . ( Suddenly SGT AL grabs BIRDY by his shirt front . ) AL COLUMBATO You had me you shit . You had me ! BIRDY Yeah , but it 's a long way back . AL COLUMBATO It 's a long way for both of us . Both of us , you selfish bastard . You could 've taken a shortcut . Why 'd you quit on me , huh ? Why 'd you quit ? ( BIRDY now angry himself , begins to push back . Hard ) BIRDY You left first , remember ? Besides , I never " quit " . I just . Went . I wanted to get to a place so far out there even I could n't find where I was . AL COLUMBATO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was . Peace . For a little while . The only thing rushing through my head was sky . Cold , fast sky . It was a kind of . Paradise . ( Suddenly SGT AL explodes in a way we have not seen before , the potential for violence against BIRDY , for a moment , is frightening. ) p. 94 AL COLUMBATO So why did n't you just stay there ! ? Why did n't you just stay there in your fucking paradise ? ! ( They are both silent a moment . BIRDY speaks gently now , all anger gone . ) BIRDY Because you were here . ( SGT AL releases BIRDY with a final push . They both are suddenly very tired . ) BIRDY I was a good bird . Was n't I ? AL COLUMBATO ( Gently ) Fuck you . BIRDY Man , you would n't shut up . Talk , talk , talk . But God damn you sounded sweet ! Like Sunrise Serenade . AL COLUMBATO Cut it out . BIRDY Look at us . We used to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember that , Al ? AL COLUMBATO Yeah , Bird boy and Super boy . Nothing could really touch us . We were so good at playing we did n't need , to make up games . We were the game . Only now we 've been shot down . BIRDY Gravity . The pull of the earth . Bird Boy ca n't fly . Super Boy ca n't chew nails and spit tacks . So ? AL COLUMBATO How the hell are we going to get you out of this place ? White 's got you pegged for a once-in-a-lifetime case . p. 95 BIRDY When I decide to get out of here , I 'll go . But not now . AL COLUMBATO When ? BIRDY I need a little time to figure out what I can do so I can stay alive . Then I 'll go . AL COLUMBATO Do n't you get it ? You 're locked in . You ca n't just walk out . BIRDY I 'm not worried , Al . I 'll get out . That 's not the problem . AL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those two doors and there 's the door to the ward . I think RENALDI would help us there . But there 's guards at the gate . If you think you can fly over that , then you 're still a loon . BIRDY Come on , Al . We 're both loons . We never fit the plan . We made the plan fit us . It looks to me like everyone who is n't crazy goes at it day by day because each day is there and then when they run out of days they close their eyes and call themselves dead . If that 's sanity , then that 's not us . AL COLUMBATO If you go crazy again I 'll beat the crap out of you . BIRDY The same old Al . Look . Getting out 's just another adventure . Right ? AL COLUMBATO Hey , I got an idea in sort of a dream , Birdy . It was a terrific dream after the other ones . I woke myself up laughing out loud ! You know those baseballs your mother kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . She did ! This huge crate of baseballs , for fucks sake ! p. 96 BIRDY Yeah . You told me . I remember . AL COLUMBATO You do ? BIRDY So what about them ? AL COLUMBATO If we could pull this off we 'd out-crazy White in spades . The fucking army 'll give you a hundred and fifty percent disability just so they wo n't ever have to see or hear from you again . First , I 'll give White a full load of bullshit about how you seem to be coming along and how when I talk about those baseballs you perk up . Then I 'll talk White into bringing the baseballs into your cage to see if they snap you out of it . The next morning I 'll get White and RENALDI to come to your cell . RENALDI opens the door and you come hopping over to us . Then you hop around the box , sniff the balls , stuff like that . Then you make you 're big move . You spread your legs over the box and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're my eggs ? AL COLUMBATO Right . And White is getting all excited and starts scribbling notes to himself . And you , you lift your ass a little off the nest and reach under you and pull out a baseball . BIRDY I hold up the egg . I peer into the light , through the ball for somewhere between five seconds and five minutes , and then I yell " Sterile ! " p. 97 AL COLUMBATO Then you stand up and throw it right at White 's head . BIRDY It 's a perfect pitch . AL COLUMBATO His glasses go flying . BIRDY The lenses are okay AL COLUMBATO But the frames are bent . You , yell again BIRDY Sterile ! And pitch again . AL COLUMBATO White goes down backwards like he 's been pole-axed . BIRDY Foul ball , strike two . AL COLUMBATO Then Renaldi gets the idea and starts pitching . I start throwing balls at the window . Balls are flying all over the ward , breaking the light bulb , bouncing off the ceiling , bouncing off White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Squeeze play ! BIRDY Run him down ! AL COLUMBATO Strike three ! BIRDY It 's a home run , a case of Wheaties ! AL COLUMBATO And then . BIRDY And then . AL COLUMBATO We run out the door and lock White in here . So how about it ? ( BIRDY and SGT AL let their excitement and laughter wind down. ) p. 98 BIRDY Al . ( Beat ) How many times are you going to have to pin your old man ? Jesus Christ , I 'm not throwing baseballs at White for you . It does n't make sense anymore . We 're practically grown men . The whole thing has to end somewhere . Do n't you know , time pins everybody anyway . AL COLUMBATO Alright , hot shot . Flying ace . How 're you going to get us out of this then . Are we just going to fly over the walls and pretend it did n't happen ? BIRDY This is how it goes . We climb out onto the roof of the hospital . AL COLUMBATO I knew it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to the roof . It 's a beautiful day . Sunshine with big , soft fat clouds . Suddenly we feel something happening to our bodies . We 're not afraid . It feels good . Like a tremor starting at our feet and traveling up our spines . You reach over your head to the back of your neck . You start pulling and it 's like a giant zipper . You unzip over your head and across your face , your neck , over your stomach down to your crotch . AL COLUMBATO Birdy . BIRDY Then you step out of your hot-shot Al suit . You stand there in the sunlight . And you 're beautiful . You 're thin with long , strong sinuous muscles and covered with golden-colored down like a baby duck . You spring to the edge of the wall and motion for me to follow . I do . Then we glide , with backs arched , arms out flapping strongly . ( Split scene : YOUNG AL on his bike with YOUNG BIRDY standing on the platform on the front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the wings are different this time , enormous , spectacular . YOUNG BIRDY does not fully open these wings until the last moment. ) p. 99 YOUNG BIRDY I need to get up the speed before I can lift off . YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Why do n't you just jump off the gas tank again . AL COLUMBATO Not me , Birdy . I 'm not going to jump off a building and get myself killed . BIRDY Neither am I , Al . AL COLUMBATO So what do we do then ? YOUNG BIRDY When we get to the mark , at the edge of the hill , you throw on the brakes . BIRDY We go downstairs and check the box of baseballs in at the entrance . Then we walk on out of here , out the gates . AL COLUMBATO Just like that ? YOUNG AL COLUMBATO Give me the signal . BIRDY Just like that . AL COLUMBATO And , so what happens then ? BIRDY Nothing , Al . Just the rest of our lives . YOUNG BIRDY Peddle like mad . And give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? That 's the way it ends ? BIRDY No . Not really . It 's never that easy . Nobody gets off that way . YOUNG BIRDY Now , Al . Now ! p. 100 BIRDY But it 's worth a try . ( YOUNG AL pedals furiously . There is a rushing sound as YOUNG BIRDY opens fully his enormous and radiant wings : they are stunningly beautiful , awe-inspiring in the light . We hear the sound of a flock of birds lifting off . YOUNG BIRDY leans forward to spring up into the air . The lights go black. )
