The history of Germany since World War II  --  partition and unification  --  is reminiscent of one of those studies of twins who have been brought up in completely different families . They may have inherited many of the same characteristics , but in this case they have grown up in environments that are as unlike each other as possible . When they are brought back together , how similar will they be ? How well will they understand each other ? <P> In her perceptive , engaging , but ultimately frustrating new book , The Politics of Memory : Looking for Germany in the New Germany ( Random House ; 293 pages ; $27.50 ) , Jane Kramer , who writes the " Letter from Europe " column for the New Yorker , addresses the question of how the former West Germans and the former East Germans are adjusting to each other . She finds wariness and disappointment ; they are making an edgy acceptance of unity without much enthusiasm . " As far as ' mentality ' goes , " Kramer writes , paraphrasing the thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Germany , and will still be high in ten or twenty years . " <P> Kramer 's approach is not systematic , and the subjects of her six chapters are very specific : a restaurant in a bohemian district of West Berlin , an East German poet who spied on his friends for the secret police , the struggle over what kind of Holocaust memorial  --  if any  --  should be built in Berlin . Perhaps the most poignant and telling of the stories is the one about a young man whom Kramer calls Peter Schmidt , a drifting East German who tried to escape when the Wall still existed , was caught and imprisoned but was eventually sold to the West ( the East often traded political prisoners for hard currency ) . But he is ill-suited to the ambitious , aggressive life in the West . As Kramer writes , " Peter says that maybe the role of being East German , the pity of being East German , is that you are always at your best , and your clearest , standing at a wall , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other side . " <P> Peter suffers from a deep passivity , bred by East Germany 's attempts to " produce a worker for the worker 's state , someone not too smart , not too skeptical . " When Peter first arrives in Hamburg in 1985 , Kramer writes , " He had a little cassette player , tapes by Pink Floyd , Grace Slick , and the Grateful Dead , a filter coffeepot , and two hundred and fifty grams of Jacobs Fein und Mild Guatemala-blend coffee . He had everything he needed until someone came and told him what to do . " <P> The book offers many such pointed moments . Kramer quotes a West German after the Wall has come down , saying , " What can I possibly say to an East Berlin scientist who , after years of trying , finally gets permission to travel , and buys an old piece of western equipment for his lab , and spends a year rebuilding it , and is proud of it  --  and then scientists from the West arrive and say , ' This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is closed . " In her chapter about the opening of the Stasi files , Kramer focuses on a poet , Alexander Anderson , who is a devotee of French literary criticism . When informing on a fellow poet named Uwe Kolbe , he " supplied the Stasi with the bewildering news that Kolbe was ' relieving the noun of its burden ... with phonetic adjectival exaggerations. ' "
