Dr. Allen Hershkowitz , senior scientist at The Natural Resources Defense Council ( NRDC ) , has spent the last 20 years up to his neck in garbage . The former INFORM researcher , advisor to the World Bank , the U.N . and several Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) advisory boards , Dr. Hershkowitz spends most of his time working on achieving environmental goals through economic incentives and green development . For the last few years , Hershkowitz has worked tirelessly to create the controversial Bronx Community Paper Company , a $465 million paper recycling and community development project in the South Bronx , New York . When he is not wading through endless streams of permits and regulations , Hershkowitz is taking government and industry officials on tours of **27;54;TOOLONG companies in Europe . Though the recycling plant has some opponents  --  including the New York City Sierra Club , which would have preferred to see a freight train hub on the site  --  most green groups see it as an excellent example of merging environmental improvement and economic priorities . E caught up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City . He was still full of outrage over " Recycling is Garbage , " John Tierney 's cover story for The New York Times Magazine last summer ( see cover story ) . Hershkowitz wrote the NRDC 's 75-page " In Defense of Recycling , " an erudite and definitive response to the " waste is good business " mindset . E : How did you first become involved with recycling issues ? HERSHOWITZ : I came from a home of Eastern Europeans , where there was always a reuse of things . My parents were recyclers and reusers . It was n't an issue . It was just their ethic . I grew up in New York City , the bastion of liberalism . There were drop off places for bottles and cans , or we would give them to homeless people on the street . New York has a higher number of environmentalists then in many parts of the world . Recycling is probably the single most successful environmental policy out there . Most people in the world today know about reduce , reuse , recycle . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recycling than voted in the last four presidential elections . You said people understand the concept of recycling , yet the U.S. is 15th in paper recycling and 19th in glass . Why is that ? Well , because of economic incentives . We worked five years with a coalition of environmentalists on the National Recycling Act . By the time the bill went to market , we had to kill it because it was defining incineration as recycling . It was an anti-recycling bill by the time it was done . Is the federal government going to subsidize recycled materials as they do virgin resources ? It 's not a question of federal subsidies for recycling . It 's a question of stopping federal subsidies for virgin materials . When people say look at all these subsidies for recycling , I want to know what they 're talking about . To this day , the energy industry  --  coal , oil and natural gas  --  gets billions in federal subsidies and tax breaks . Despite all this talk about a constitutional amendment to balance the budget and cut the deficit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of the corporate welfare programs . We have to take the bias out of the system , which right now works against recycling . What about the issue of energy ? Aluminum and glass use more energy to recycle than plastic , yet plastics are harder to recycle . Which is the better recyclable commodity ? The problem with plastics is that the plastics industry has taken no responsibility to seeing to it that their products are recycled . Basically , what we need is for the plastics industry to start the infrastructure for collecting plastics , which is very expensive . All industries whose products wind up as waste should have an financial obligation to see to it that their material is recovered and recycled . Like Germany 's practice of forcing responsibility onto manufacturers ? Exactly . Germany 's program is new , but it 's absolutely right on . Municipal waste is the only waste stream that is managed by the consumer , as opposed to the generator . We 've got to integrate the cost of waste disposal as a price of doing business . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a grassroots movement that stopped the industry from doing that . But they 'll market a diamond ring in a refrigerator box , and not have any financial penalty for doing it , unless we assign each item its true cost . What about pay-as-you-throw programs , which , in conjunction with strong recycling efforts , charge people by the pound for the garbage they generate ? Most people will accept recycling programs if you tell them about the alternatives . If you tell people that there 's a recycling program in the community , they 'll nod appreciatively . If you tell them there 's a landfill on the block , they 'll say , " Not here . " Many people who are educated about recycling still oppose paying for the garbage they generate . Well , they 're going to pay anyway . Pay-as-you-throw allows them to pay less . The majority of people want public recycling programs . People like recycling programs . It 's a very popular thing . I 've done nothing but garbage for 20 years , and I remember very early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sector . Working at NRDC , we were very much involved in trying to get government agencies accountable for their environmental impact . Finally we succeeded in 1991 when we got the Federal Facilities Act , which made federal sites have to comply with national environmental laws . So working here , it was clear to me early on that the biggest polluter in New York state was New York State , and the biggest polluter in the country was the U.S. government . How can businesses encourage other businesses to take more responsibility for wasteful manufacturing ? It takes economics to do it . Politics follows economics . We have to own the means of production . That 's why NRDC started the Bronx Mill . If we own the means of production , if we own the paper industry , we would n't be lobbying Congress to keep our forest subsidies . We would be lobbying Congress to give us subsidies to locate in urban areas to use secondary materials . It really does come down to us being better at business , than the folks we 're trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Investment banking is social policy . Investment banking is more important to environmentalists , objectively , than nine out of 10 things Congress is going to do . Some company orders a fleet of cars . Well , did they order natural gas vehicles , zero-emission vehicles , or did they order diesel trucks ? That decision has nothing to do with what Congress is doing . Do you think the private sector is going to take the initiative to establish recycled paper mills and recovery stations for recycled materials ? Or is it going to have to come from mandates brought by the federal government ? There is no national recycling law , and there absolutely should be . There 's a national recycling law in Japan . Germany exports twice the gross domestic product that we do , and the Germans recycle two to three times as much . And they have a law . Are industry groups like the American Plastics Council responsible for the low rates of plastics recycling ? Yes . Absolutely . The recycling bill we had worked on for almost five years was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American Forest and Paper Association did n't want it . The Grocery Manufacturers ' Association , which also opposed it , is among the most aggressively anti-recycling trade groups out there . Recycling is big business , but it is stymied by legislation . It 's like the telecommunications industry . It grows and grows , until it gets a new law to help it grow more . Well , recycling has grown and grown and grown , but we do n't have a new law . We have a 21st century recycling infrastructure , with literally 19th century resource laws . Was John Tierney 's New York Times article an honest look at the problems recycling is facing ? Tierney 's article was an intellectually dishonest and biased report by an ideologue . Tierney 's article is not hard to respond to . It 's an opportunity for us to show the shallowness of the anti-recycling rhetoric . And that rhetoric is coming from the big manufacturing companies , the big resource companies and the consumer products companies . They 're threatened by recycling because they benefit so substantially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ultimately , we 're going to have to change , because when you look at the overall waste stream , we 're producing 12 to 14 billion tons of waste a year in this country . Globally , 30 billion tons of waste , at least . So in 10 years , that 's 300 billion tons of waste . Where 's it going to go ? Already there 's a big movement underway to start using agricultural waste in a much more substantial way . We 're starting to see experiments that use it in papermaking . China is big on using rice straw . But it 's going to be a battle . When Al Gore wrote in Earth in the Balance that environmentalism was going to be the central organizing principle of the 21st century , he was attacked by then-Vice President Dan Quayle , but that does n't mean that Gore was wrong . He was right . And the reason for that  --  the economic factor  --  is going to become very clear , very soon . Will teaching children a recycling philosophy change their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will teach them connections with other things and other people in the world . Recycling teaches children that they 're connected to something they do n't see  --  a forest , perhaps . They 're connected to tribal lands that are getting dumped on . They 're connected to less-developed countries that are now recipients of hazardous waste . Talk about family values  --  recycling helps children understand them . Japan indoctrinates children from birth to these concepts . What about Tierney 's point that it 's not so much less landfill space , but guilt people feel for overconsumption that makes them recycle ? If people feel guilty , and recycle because they feel guilty , OK . I would then say that they should get beyond that . That 's a lower consciousness . When I recycle , I think of my kids . I want to feel good with them . If guilt is what it takes to get John Tierney to do it , then I will accept that . Do you think recycling is a bipartisan issue ? Of course it 's bipartisan . Republicans and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The challenge now for recycling is not whether it 's good or bad . What 's going to kill recycling is if we ca n't get the price right and make it more competitive economically . And that means if it 's not economic now , do n't abandon it , adjust the economics so it gets done right . The job for the environmentalist is becoming harder , because we have to deal with so many different things . Do you want to know what my reading material last night was in bed ? Spreadsheets . I 'm working with investment bankers who would just as quickly finance a nuclear power plant , or a garbage-burning plant . Does community pressure have a role when it comes to deciding between a recycled paper mill , garbage-burning plant or nuclear facility , or are financial considerations overriding ? The community pressure helps us reconsider the economic incentives . The economic direction is going to help us change the law . But the problem is , the popular will is being stymied by special interests . And corrupt campaign financing . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew how much any particular senator cost . I knew that if I gave one particular senator $40,000 , which was $2,000 more than Coke was giving him , he would have changed his position on the bottle bill . It 's not a shock to anybody that these guys are for sale . But I ca n't go into my drawer and say " here 's $10,000 . " We depend on community pressure , popular pressure , science , and rationality . But that takes you only so far . If Al Gore runs for President in the year 2000 , will we finally have an environmental president , as opposed to a Bill Clinton , who only speaks a good environmental game ? Gore is an environmental leader . He has shown his tenacity on environmental issues in this administration . He has consistently fought the fight that needed to be fought for the cause . It does n't necessarily mean he 's going to win . He 's up against big interests . No one could dispute the fact that this administration is a greener administration because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hero . Will he do everything the environmentally correct way if he becomes president ? No . Can he ? No . But does Gore have real power right now ? Gore has a lot of power . I met with him . It was our connection to him that got the government to start buying recycled paper . What a revolutionary idea . Buy recycled paper . But it was n't going to happen without him . I look forward to the opportunity to see Gore campaign for president . <p>
