Section : B.E . SPECIAL REPORT ON SMALL BUSINESS This election year , black business development is a politically correct theme for both major parties . But when will talk load to action ? <p> Ask Everett Hall when he thinks the sluggish economy will awaken from its two-year slumber and he 'll simply say : " I wish it happened yesterday . " <p> But even yesterday is n't soon enough . Hall is president and CEO of The Designers Inc. , a Silver Spring , Md. , clothing manufacturer . The beleaguered business owner says the nation 's retail slump has caused customer traffic to dip nearly 20% in the stores that sell his line of suits and casual sportswear . One of the outlets that sells his suits even shut its doors . " It 's been very difficult , " admits Hall , 34 , whose 7-year-old company posted $1.1 million in sales last year . " Things have certainly slowed down , " he says . <p> Like many small business owners , Hall blames the Bush administration for the economy 's weakness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he says . " I 've become so disillusioned . " <p> So have other small business owners . ( For the purpose of this article , BLACK ENTERPRISE defines a small business as one with sales between $200,000 and $10 million . They are large enough for BE 'S Making It column , but too small for the BE 100 's . ) . Earlier this year , the Small Business Service Bureau Inc . ( SBSB ) , a Worcester , Mass. - based lobbying organization , surveyed 35,000 small business owners ( many of whom are white ) and only 1% believed that Bush helps them . Since 1984 , that figure has decreased from the 14% that thought President Reagan was helpful . What 's more alarming is that 68% of the small business owners believe Bush is doing a poor job at assisting small businesses . Those kinds of numbers are impossible to ignore  --  especially in an election year . And this presidential election is shaping up as nothing less than crucial for black business . An increasing number of small business owners in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relief and for it to finally establish a small business agenda for their needs . The grim fact is , the survival of many of these businesses depends on it . <p> It will take more than enterprise zones and " putting America first , " for small businesses to navigate the coming year . That 's why owners are eager for the election : Whoever is in charge at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue will make a profound difference on how small businesses fare in 1993  --  and through the decade . Small Businesses Challenges <p> Fostering small business development is in vogue partly because of this year 's presidential election and knee-jerk concern for urban businesses since the Los Angeles riots . Unfortunately , a lethargic economy is blunting the decade long boom of creating small businesses by African-Americans . And although the recession has officially ended , many business owners do n't believe it . Consider : The economy grew a disappointing 1.4% from April through June  --  less than half the rate of the first quarter . If you 're a small business owner , that 's bad news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success . Even venture-capital fund managers who helped fuel the 1980s business boom are pessimistic . Since 1987 , the Small Business Administration ( SBA ) reports that new-venture capital declined from $4.2 billion to about $1.1 billion last year . ( An exception is Fairview Capital , a new fund that plans to raise $250 million exclusively for minority businesses . ) Additionally , despite low interest rates , banks are not eager to lend . The struggle to get capital , says John R. Winston , national assistant director for the Washington , D.C.-based Minority Business Development Agency ( MBDA ) " will be the thing that will keep most black business owners from making it . Bankers continue to redline , and they still have little , if any , faith in a minority 's ability to weather these times . " <p> But these are n't the only issues bothering small business owners . Many believe that business-related legislation  --  on issues such as health insurance and mainstreaming disabled workers  --  may trim profits . Additionally , entrepreneurs are waiting to see how the final report of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Bush and Congress . ( At press time , the president had not commented on the report . ) <p> Recently , despite lip service regarding the promotion of minority business , the federal response has been reactive . For example , since the L.A. riots , Bush allocated $600 million to rebuild small businesses and homes . And last June , Congress approved $500 million more for national summer youth employment programs and SBA loans . <p> The administration also called for creating urban enterprise zones in 300 areas nationwide . But not everyone is a fan of the concept . Some small business leaders fear that companies looking for tax havens stand to gain more from enterprise zones than community residents and entrepreneurs . " If these enterprise zones are just going to be window dressing , then they wo n't work , " says Dolores C. Ratcliffe , founder and president of the Los Angeles-based Association of Black Women Entrepreneurs ( ABWE ) . " Black businesses need assistance on multiple fronts . " <p> When small businesses fail , so does the economy . For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that new businesses would have added only about 144,000 jobs in 1991 , compared with 1.5 million in 1990 . Why such a decline ? When small businesses do n't do well , they do n't hire . It 's that simple . <p> Presidential candidate Bill Clinton says he can solve that problem . Among other things , his economic plan advocates creating a nationwide network of community development banks to provide loans for small entrepreneurs , creating urban enterprise zones and strengthening the Community Reinvestment Act to reduce redlining . Harriet Michel , president of the New York City-based National Minority Supplier Development Council Inc. , which promotes business between minority companies and the public and private sector , is guardedly optimistic . " We 're not really sure what Clinton 's plan is , but at least he 's paying attention , " she says . On The Road To Recovery <p> Most of the nation 's small business owners suffer from what can be called a severe case of economic shell shock . They still are recovering from a recession that hit them harder than any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Dun &; Bradstreet Corp. , a New York City marketer of business information and related services , U.S. business failures rose almost 16% in the first five months of 1992 to 42,118 from 36,355 in the same period of 1991 . Business failures were up in all industries including real estate , finance , insurance . Bankruptcies in the wholesale and retail trade sectors remained at high levels . Wholesale trade failures rose 21.3% for the first five months of 1992 and retail trade failures increased 15.7% for the same period . <p> However , the recession is only part of the reason business failures ballooned . Dwindling markets and a weakened financial sector also played a role in why a number of companies collapsed . <p> Despite the gloom and doom , small business owners believe the worst is over . The feeling is that " The Big Small Business Shakeout " has hit bottom . An SBSB survey says 31% of the 35,000 small business owners polled believe the business climate is improving , up from 8% in 1990 . And last May in a study by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private sector 's view on small business issues , 73% of those surveyed said small businesses have continually improved . <p> African-American business owners  --  many of whom struggle even when the economy is solid  --  are surprisingly hopeful . Jacques E. Thermilus , president of the $7.5 million Urban Construction Inc. in Miami , is one example . " I 'm hoping that the president  --  whoever it is  --  will really help the small business owner , " Thermilus says . " We need to pump some money in the urban areas . " <p> Bettye Davis-Lewis , CEO of Diversified Health Care Systems , Inc. in Houston , is another example of a glass-is-half-full entrepreneur . Davis-Lewis also plans to increase capital spending by 20% for her home health care service and projects her revenues will grow from $300,000 to $400,000 this year . " We want to branch out into more rural areas because there is such a lack of accessibility to health care , and people need it , " she says . Battling The High Cost Of Health Care <p> Health insurance . Mention those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'll say is : " Too costly . " And they 're right . Thirty-four million to 37 million Americans have no health insurance . The Congressional Budget Office reports that 8O% of the uninsured are in families with at least one worker , and the majority of these are in small businesses . The situation is even more severe for African-American business owners who more often than not have fewer financial resources . <p> The Consumer Price Index shows medical costs rising at nearly 2.5 times the overall inflation rate . The average policy costs more than $300 per month for a family and more than $180 per month for an individual . In 1990 , business owners spent an average of $3,000 per employee on health insurance . Small employers pay as much as 20% more than large employers for the same coverage . There are two reasons for this : Larger companies can negotiate lower premiums , and more paperwork often is involved in processing small business premiums . <p> Health care costs will consume close to 13% of the gross national product this year  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the decade . Close to two-thirds of the more than 5,000 entrepreneurs responding to a recent survey by the Visa Business Card and the National Federation of Independent Business ( NFIB ) in Washington , D.C. , cited medical insurance costs as a " critical " problem . <p> That was the case for Thermilus of Urban Construction . He says he 's had a tough time finding affordable coverage for his 21 full-time employees . " We screened about a half-dozen companies for a policy , before we found one . " <p> Guy T. Dunn , vice president of marketing and sales for Scott &; Sons Maintenance Inc. , a Clifton Heights , Pa. - based facilities maintenance and service company , laments that his firm ca n't even afford to look for a health plan for its workers . " We want to give our employees health insurance benefits , but it 's just too expensive , " Dunn says . " I know they would love for us to pay for something . " <p> To make health care affordable for more Americans , Congress is considering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bentsen ( D-Texas ) and Dave Durenberger ( R-Minn. ) sponsor the Better Access To Affordable Health Care bill . lt aims to make health care more affordable for small business owners by allowing self-employed individuals to deduct the full cost of the health insurance ; enabling small businesses to form health insurance purchasing groups to reduce administrative and medical costs ; and expanding Medicare benefits to cover a number of preventive care services . <p> Small black-owned businesses that are victims of redlining should find it easier to obtain coverage in a small business purchasing group like the one in the Bentsen-Durenberger bill . Many insurance companies have refused to write policies for such businesses as bars , restaurants and hair salons . " The element you want to look for in these bills , " says Lisa M. Caroll , vice president of health services for the SBSB , " is : Will it prevent insurers from discriminating against certain kinds of businesses ? " <p> The Bentsen-Durenberger bill , however , has some drawbacks . For example , the owner of a business not considered " high risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are high risk because all are in the same purchasing group . <p> There are no easy answers to solving the problem and it 's impossible to please everyone . For example , Gov . Clinton proposes a " play or pay " health insurance policy to force employers to either provide health coverage for their workers or pay a new payroll tax . <p> The NFIB estimates that the proposal will cost nearly $90 billion in the first year , would force business owners to pay more than $42 billion in increased insurance premiums or tax penalties and cost tax payers more than $44 billion in higher taxes or bigger deficits . NFIB claims between 1 million and 2 million small business jobs would disappear and the growth of start-up companies would decrease sharply if Clinton 's plan became law . <p> Stay tuned . Making Room For The Disabled <p> If you 're a small business owner and have never given much thought to hiring a handicapped person or redesigning your office to accommodate the needs of a disabled worker , you 'd better start now . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , employers with 25 or more workers must comply with new regulations that prohibit discrimination in employment practices . The ADA , effective July 26 , also says offices must now accommodate a handicapped person 's needs . For example , if an employee who uses a wheelchair ca n't use your bathroom or fit through one of your doorways , you could be slapped with a lawsuit . <p> The new measure has serious implications for small businesses . The question is : How many business owners actually know what the law means to them ? The answer : Not many . " Right now , this law is a big question mark , " says William J. Dennis Jr. , NFIB 's senior research fellow . <p> Forward-thinking entrepreneurs , however , are taking crash courses on the new law . " The average business owner should take the time , energy and expense to decide how he has to comply , " says Darrell S. Gay , managing partner at Minter &; Gay , a New York City law firm . " Contact the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department for the accommodation provisions . Remember , anyone who has 25 or more employees can be sued . There will definitely be an increase in the number of charges by disabled persons because the grayness of the law will cause some confusion . " <p> It 's clear that the ADA will be a blessing for some businesses and a curse for others . The law will create a new business for many entrepreneurs . Construction firms are salivating since they project that many businesses will have to redesign their offices to accommodate handicapped employees . <p> Black-owned law firms also may benefit . To avoid lawsuits , smart small business owners are getting early legal consultation to determine how to comply . " This law will create a new industry just like the environmental laws did , " notes Weldon Latham , senior partner at the Washington , D.C.-based law firm Shaw , Pittman , Potts &; Trowbridge . " This will be a growth industry . " <p> The ADA , however , wo n't be a boon for all . Since many black-owned firms are undercapitalized , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law  --  especially when it comes to building ramps , workstations and bathrooms . " This law will certainly hit the smaller businesses harder than it will the larger companies , " Latham says . <p> For more information on ADA requirements that affect employment , contact the EEOC at 1801 L St. NW , Suite 501 , Washington , DC 20036 , or call 800-USA-ABLE . <p> Looking for some of the hottest small business industries ? ( See , " Hot Areas For Small Business " and chart , " Leaders Of The Pack . " ) One of the first places to start is health care . According to the Occupational Outlook from the BLS , the health service industry 's employment levels are projected to grow to 11.2 million by the year 2000 from 8.2 million in 1988 . <p> Some of the health care industry segments that offer good opportunities include medical claims processing , home health care and medical products distribution . Other industries poised for growth include temporary help , environmental cleanup , international trade and telecommunications . <p> According to the American Express @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depends on the nation 's employment and industrial outlook . The top five states in terms of employment growth for the first quarter of 1992 through the end of the year are projected to be Nevada , Kansas , Iowa , Arizona and Minnesota . The bottom five : Connecticut , New York , North Dakota , Pennsylvania and California . <p> Although black small business owners pay attention to such forecasts , most are concerned about the outcome of the presidential election . In times of economic instability , African-American entrepreneurs often look to government for leadership  --  and help . Today is no different . Now that the concept of building up minority-owned businesses is center stage , black business owners are waiting to see whether the president  --  whoever he is  --  makes good on his pledge .

TABLE <p> Source : The U.S. Small Business Administration , Office of Advocacy , Washington , D.C. , 1991 . <p> GRAPH : LAUNCHING A DREAM : New business incorporations , 1981-1990 ( Source : The U.S. Small Business Administration , Office of Advocacy , Washington , D.C. , 1991 ) <p> By KEVIN D. THOMPSON <p> HOT AREAS FOR SMALL BUSINESS <p> Looking for business opportunities ? Although the weak economy has done some serious damage to the nation 's small business sector , there are still industries that are either growing or are ready to do so . It 's no secret that small businesses are becoming major players in the game of economic hardball . Here are some of the hottest areas : <p> HEALTH/PHARMACEUTICAL SERVICES . Health and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The industry represents about 12% of the nation 's gross national product and is growing at a 25% clip . The reason is simple : More people live longer and need nursing services or home health care . According to the National Center for Health Statistics in Hyattsville , Md. , the average life expectancy increased to 75.3 years in 1989 from 74.7 years in 1984 . <p> Three members of the Reed family Cynthia , Arjester and Hamish have cashed in on the boon since starting their medical products distribution firm three years ago . The siblings own Branches Medical Inc. , a Lauderhill , Fla. - based company that sells such medical and surgical supplies as wheelchairs , braces and Band-Aids . " We 're on to something hot here , " says CEO Hamish C. Reed . " This is a recession-proof business and there 's always going to be a lot of buying and selling . " <p> TEMPORARY EMPLOYMENT . Pinching pennies has become a way of life in corporate America and that suits Allene Graves just fine . " Most companies do n't want the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what the future will hold , " says Graves , president of The Answer Temps Inc . ( TAT ) in Washington , D.C. , " so , they 're turning to temp agencies until they feel secure . " <p> More companies are doing just that and making such agencies as Graves ' a success . Graves admits she had no idea of the industry 's growth potential when she hung her shingle five years ago . TAT grossed $400,000 in sales in 1991 and expects to earn $700,000 in sales by the year 's end . <p> HEALTH AND FITNESS . With the current resurgence of whole-body health promotion , the health and fitness industry is booming worldwide . In 1990 , Americans spent $5.3 billion on health club memberships and $11 billion on sports clothing . <p> That 's good news to Carlos Blackwell , owner of the American Lady Spa &; Men 's Gym in Houston . Blackwell 's 3-year-old company earned $600,000 in sales last year and projects revenues of $750,000 in 1992 . The weak economy has hurt many small businesses , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his facility . " The recession has been a tremendous boost to our business , " says Blackwell , a former bodybuilder . " When a person is under stress , they may feel bad , but they still want to look good . lt seems that the worse the economy gets , the better it gets for us . " <p> IMPORT/EXPORT . It 's a fact , American business has gone global and so are more small business owners . According to the Commerce Department imports and exports rang up nearly $900 billion in business in 1990 . " More business owners are realizing that they have to expand their market , " says John Robinson , president and CEO of the National Minority Business Council Inc . ( NMBC ) . " And if they ca n't do it here , they have to do it abroad . " <p> Doing business internationally is not for everyone . lt usually requires a lot of upfront expense in the time and travel it takes to establish contacts in business and government in a foreign country . You 'll also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to communicate effectively despite cultural differences . lt takes deep pockets and a lot of patience to establish profitable international business relationships . <p> PHOTO : Siblings Hamish , Cynthia and Arjester Reed are counting on a boom in the health care industry to boost Branches Medical Inc .
