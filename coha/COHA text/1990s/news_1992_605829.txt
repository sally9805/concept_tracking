<p> Attorney General William P. Barr 's new multimillion-dollar plan to curb illegal immigration calls for new border lights and fences and 150 additional Border Patrol agents in this area , where nearly half the 1 million arrests along the southern border are made each year . <p> Javier Ortega , a 40-year-old auto body repairman from Guadalajara , is not impressed . <p> Ortega and dozens of other men and women  --  and a 4-year-old girl  --  are standing on the Mexican side of a recently constructed 10-foot-high , solid steel barricade . There is a gaping hole dug under the wall . <p> " It does n't matter how many people , horses , bicycles , helicopters or planes they use , " Ortega said . " People will go . It does n't matter if the fence is electric , we 'll fry , but we 're still going . " <p> If the United States really wants to keep people out , said Carlos , a 28-year-old restaurant worker who did not give his last name , " They need to do it like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoot people . <p> " But even then we 'll go , " he laughed . <p> A few hours later  --  just after the Border Patrol 's afternoon shift change  --  a group of eight young men sat atop another section of the wall staring down at a lone agent . The agent turned away for a moment and the group jumped down and dashed about 200 yards toward a K-mart on the U.S. side of the border in San Ysidro , Calif . Other agents gave chase and it appeared some were caught . Others got away . <p> The nightly ritual had begun . On a rainy night last Wednesday , agents chased as many as 2,000 people  --  no one knows for sure  --  through the narrow canyons , parking lots , apartment complexes and businesses along the border . Some were picked up by friends or smugglers waiting on the other side . Others walked up Interstate 5 . <p> " We 'll always come back , " said Luis , a 21-year-old shoe repairman from Mexicali . He said his job last year at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home . " We have to look for a way to survive . " A Huge Economic Temptation <p> Immigration and Naturalization Service ( INS ) officials , civil rights activists and immigration experts interviewed on both sides of the border generally agreed with Luis and his friends : Short of a Berlin Wall solution , with agents instructed to shoot to kill , the huge wage disparity between the United States and Mexico will always tempt large numbers of people to sneak across the border . <p> They shared Border Patrol agent Ed Conlin 's observation shortly after the group dashed to the K-mart . " If someone really , really , really wants to make it , he will . We ca n't stop him . " <p> They also agree that the number of people trying to cross has increased in recent years , although Hispanic rights groups say INS inflates its estimates , and fails to take into account multiple apprehensions of the same people . <p> The number of people caught at the border dropped sharply for three years after the 1986 Immigration Reform and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the United States . But apprehensions have increased in the past two years to pre-law levels , with more than 1 million likely to be intercepted this year . <p> The sharpest disagreement is a longstanding one over whether the barricade and increased agents , sanctions on employers who hire illegal aliens and other enforcement measures can ever succeed in substantially reducing the numbers of illegal entrants . <p> Barr , announcing the plan Feb. 10 in a speech in San Diego , just north of here , said it was needed to stop illegal aliens from " flouting our sovereignty and ignoring our process . " He said he recognized his proposals were not " a silver bullet , " but they were a " steady march in the right direction . " <p> Critics of the U.S. enforcement effort say it is a waste of time and resources and may even impede efforts to address the underlying problem  --  the 8 to 1 wage gap between the two countries . <p> U.S. emphasis on police measures , such as the new wall , increases resentment and economic nationalism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Center for U.S.-Mexican Studies at the University of California at San Diego . Barr 's proposals " make it more difficult for the Mexican government to adopt free trade policies " needed for a long-term solution . <p> Focusing on enforcement is " highly inflammatory on the Mexican side , much more than U.S. people realize , " he said . " Even if the practical impact on immigration is negligible , the symbolic effect is great . " <p> " Every country has a right to control its borders , " said Jorge Bustamante , president of the state-funded College of the Northern Frontier in Tijuana , which closely studies immigration . <p> " But the United States wants to have its cake and eat it too . You want to stop illegal immigration , but you want and need cheap labor , " he said . " You can not have both . It is a U.S. schizophrenia , wanting to open and close your borders at the same time . " <p> As a result , the State Department and economic interests want free trade and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " treats Mexico as the enemy . " <p> Increased enforcement of the type outlined by Barr " is just a political game , " he said . The new steel barricade will do little to stop people , he said , " but it will have a very strong effect on political consumption in Southern California , " where anti-immigrant sentiment is strong and growing . <p> There is some evidence that increased enforcement may in some cases worsen the situation , he said . Higher entry difficulties and costs  --  the smugglers dropped their fees after the 1986 law but have raised them back to more than $ 300 a person  --  may be encouraging people to stay longer each time , Bustamante said . The increased stay in the United States then encourages some to bring their families across , actually increasing the magnet effect by the very effort to keep them out . <p> The 1986 law itself may have created a strong magnet , legalizing millions of male workers who now appear to be bringing over their families in increasing numbers . <p> But immigration officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declare the border to be open , the laws must be enforced . James B. Turnage Jr. , INS director for the San Diego area , said the 1986 law , which introduced employer sanctions for the first time , can eventually do a great deal to " turn off the jobs magnet . " <p> The sanctions , which include fines of up to $ 3,000 per worker and jail terms for repeated offenses , are " the last best chance short of militarizing the border , " he said . " We can certainly control this , and we must . <p> " This is the most generous country in the world , " in terms of number of people legally admitted each year , Turnage said . " It 's not closing the golden door , but we ca n't continue on having people crashing in through the back door . " Those trying to do so must be told to " get in line and wait your turn like everyone else . " <p> " If this goes on , " he said , " there will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights groups argue there has been a backlash against sanctions , whose effectiveness has been undermined , if not destroyed , by widespread use of forged documents . The threat of sanctions causes employers to discriminate against Hispanic citizens and legal residents , opponents say , and employers also are calling for repealing sanctions . More enforcement , critics argue , will simply increase opposition . <p> Much of the criticism against new enforcement efforts is misguided and overstated , INS officials said , focusing on each element , rather than the broader enforcment plan . <p> No one enforcement tool will deter illegal immigration , Turnage said , adding that there needs to be a " comprehensive approach " including employer sanctions and increased border security . <p> INS officials say they are under no illusions that the new steel barricade , which will eventually extend inland from the ocean for about 14 miles , will keep people out . " It 's not a people fence , " said Gustavo De La Vina , head of the Border Patrol here . " It does n't stop people . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers of people and drug smugglers to simply drive pickups and cars across the border . It has reduced rock-throwing at agents in their vehicles , he said , and has made it more difficult for some to get across , especially women and children . <p> Fence Provides ' More Control ' <p> The fence has had a " funneling effect , " he said , forcing people to circle around it , which moves them away from business and residential areas into rougher and more open terrain , where they can be caught . <p> The fence has provided " more control to a situation that had been out of control , " he said , and " the more difficult it is , the less they come . It 's a deterrent . " <p> But Cornelius said the " Keystone Kops " approach only " forces migrants and smugglers to change tactics , " and will simply " cause the revolving door to spin faster . " <p> The barricade itself , critics speculate , may have induced hundreds of men , women and children earlier this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through Mexican customs checkpoints and up Interstate 5 against the southbound traffic . The new ploy has been blocked by Mexican authorities who have stopped people from congregating on that side of the border . <p> Employer sanctions , Cornelius said , have spawned a " cottage industry " of fraudulent documents . <p> There is " no alternative " but a " developmental approach " under a Mexican-American free trade agreement , he said , so that Mexican wages would become more comparable with U.S. wages . They need not be equalized , he said , but reducing them from 8 to 1 to roughly 4 to 1 would be enough to dramatically reduce the northward flow . <p> Critics of that approach argue that it will take decades or generations to have any effect , and the problem is growing now . <p> " Free trade is not a quick fix , " Cornelius acknowledged , " but it is not going to take decades . I think you could see some significant improvement in five to 10 years . . . not generations . The current levels of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexican side is what will determine the flow . " <p> Later Wednesday evening , a dozen would-be entrants sat in a Border Patrol van en route to processing and a brief detention . Some of them had been among a group of about 100 who had gathered an hour earlier at the eastern edge of the steel fence , waiting only for agent Conlin 's van to move on . <p> Several were in good spirits , having been caught many times before , and cheerfully vowed to try again the next night . But one woman , about 25 years old , sat forlornly at the front . <p> " We Mexicans have to suffer so much , " she said to a reporter .
