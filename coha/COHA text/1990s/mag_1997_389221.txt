It 's still hard to believe , but when the National Football League starts its season this fall it will not field a team in the second-largest city in the U.S.-Los Angeles . Both the Rams and the Raiders have abandoned Southern California in recent years , heading off for St. Louis and Oakland , respectively . The twin departures have mightily angered and bewildered Southern California football fans ; many of them simply can not fathom why their champions would leave such a huge market and head for smaller , less glamorous outposts . Well , says Rams President John Shaw , the answer is clear enough if you bother to take a look at his club 's ledger : Venuerelated revenues have jumped by 25% since the team moved into the new Trans World Dome in St. Louis and began earning more from luxury box leases and a variety of corporate sponsorship deals . " The stadiums in L.A. are economically obsolete , " Shaw says . " The last year we were in Anaheim we were the lowest-revenuegenerating club in the league . Now we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factor of stadium economics . " The new economic realities of stadiums , or more precisely , all the revenue streams generated by stadiums and arenas , have become a key factor in the new corporate ownership game . Stadiums have become a prime asset , the vehicle through which smart managers can build brand loyalty and enhance the value of the franchise . The drive for new stadiums has swept through each of the four main pro leagues-football , baseball , basketball , and hockey-with 44 teams either constructing or planning splashy new venues . Most of the projects have an obvious aim : jacking up team profits with corporate sponsorships , luxury suites , souvenir shops , elaborate restaurants , and the like . Long gone are the days when team owners were satisfied to lease a stadium or arena from a city during the season and merely pocket a percentage of the gate receipts . " We operate in a highly competitive entertainment environment , " says Roger Goodell , the NFL 's point man on stadium issues . " Our teams have to be in high-quality stadiums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not just about the play on the field anymore . " That 's why , for example , Oregon billionaire Paul Allen waited to exercise his option to buy the Seattle Seahawks football franchise until after voters approved the $425 million stadium-finance package on June 17 . Without the new stadium as the core of the franchise , the money-losing Seahawks just did n't measure up as a property worth owning . Baseball clubs have pursued a strategy of breaking their teams out of ballparks they shared with football teams and moving into intimate , highly stylized stadiums like Jacobs Field in Cleveland , Oriole Park at Camden Yards in Baltimore , and the Ballpark in Arlington , located between Dallas and Fort Worth . These ballparks have become tremendously successful because they have seats closer to the action and provide better sightlines and more women 's restrooms ( by no means a minor issue these days ) . The Ballpark in Arlington even contains a TGI Friday 's restaurant , office space , and a full-scale baseball museum . There 's talk at some stadiums of installing " smart seats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seats , with interactive television monitors that could provide statistics and scenes of what 's happening at games elsewhere . All these features translate into more ticket sales and better sponsorship deals . In San Francisco , for example , the Giants baseball club said goodbye to the 49ers , with which it currently shares 3Com Park , and is building its own privately financed waterfront ballpark . The new downtown stadium will have built-in eccentricities : Batters will literally be able to hit home runs into San Francisco Bay , and passersby outside the park will be able to watch the game , free , through the right-field fence . This evocation of a Norman Rockwell illustration is not being installed simply to be cute . These design features add a uniqueness that enhances the $255 million stadium 's brand value , much as Camden Yards has added value to the Orioles . The Orioles provide perhaps the most vivid example of how a new stadium can turn around a baseball team 's economic prospects . Once a lackluster performer at the box office , the club now has the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colorado Rockies .

SBC 's Pacific Bell division will pay $50 million to put its name on the Giants ' new stadium for 24 years . By comparison , 3Com Corp. , a local computer-network company , paid approximately $1 million per year for the right to put its name on Candlestick Park , a windy , 37-year-old stadium loathed by generations of Bay Area baseball fans . " This is one of the most photographed waterfronts in the world , " says Giants COO Larry Beer , " so we think this will be a showcase facility for corporate sponsors . " In the NFL , stadium revenue is rewiring economics at a fundamental level . The league operates under a revenue-sharing plan in which all television , logo-oriented merchandise , and ticket revenues are split among the league 's 30 clubs . ( Television rights are the NFL 's cash cow , comprising more than half of each team 's overall revenues on average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that play in small markets , like the Green Bay Packers or the Pittsburgh Steelers . But it also means that the New York Giants , which plays in the country 's largest media market , get the same cut of TV revenue the Packers and Steelers receive . It 's no wonder the Rams and the Raiders did n't care about the size of L.A. 's media market-given revenue sharing , it 's irrelevant . But stadiums are not . Teams are entitled to keep all the proceeds from luxury suites , stadium-based sponsorships , naming rights , and food and parking concessions . That 's why owners are willing to pull up stakes , alienate devoted fans , and move clear across the country for a new stadium . " Owners now see that their profitability lies in the revenue streams they do n't have to share , " says Robert Baade , an economics professor at Lake Forest College in Illinois and an authority on stadium finance issues . To get in on the action , some NFL teams plan to ratchet up revenues with ambitious projects that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dallas , for example , Cowboys owner Jerry Jones , in partnership with Nike , plans to spend $300 million to renovate Texas Stadium and embroider it with a mammoth football-theme shopping mall . In addition to a Niketown and other " destination stores , " the complex will also feature a football museum . Says Jones : " In the NFL , everything works back from the stadium now . And this project will maximize the stadium 's potential and enhance interest in the team . " Not to be outdone , his archrival , San Francisco 49ers owner Edward DeBartolo , recently won voter approval to push forward with a $525 million stadium-mall project that is expected to host a Super Bowl by 2003 . Under the new economic rules , big stadium revenues are also essential if an NFL franchise is to sign big-ticket players and stay competitive . A large part of the reason why the three-year-old Carolina Panthers football team almost reached the Super Bowl last year is because it owns Ericsson Stadium in Charlotte , N.C. , and can use venue-based revenues to sign great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which have suffered through some lackluster seasons in recent years , are a great bet to go to the playoffs this coming season-and quite possibly the Super Bowl in the 1998-99 season . Why ? This fall the team will play in a brand-new , club-owned $250 million stadium loaded with 208 luxury suites . The $30 million in additional revenue those suites are expected to generate will enable the club to sign more topranked players . All this constitutes a big change from the NFL 's recent past . There used to be a time when assembling a championship team actually turned a club 's balance sheet red . Between 1980 and 1990 , for example , the 49ers ruled the league with the best record in football and four Super Bowl titles . But it 's a good thing owner DeBartolo is a multimillionaire real estate magnate , because his team lost $45 million during those years . In contrast , the Tampa Bay Buccaneers , the worst team of the decade , earned $47 million in operating income . Not even Hollywood 's economics are that upside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into revenues , " says Paul Much , an investment banker with Houlihan Lokey Howard &; Zukin in Chicago who works closely with many pro teams . " If you went to the Super Bowl , you lost money . " How could that be ? Simple : To reach the championship , the 49ers spared no expense in taking care of its players and dished out big money for superstars like Joe Montana and Jerry Rice ; its costs surpassed its income . Stadium economics and the Dallas Cowboys have changed all that . When Jones bought the Cowboys in 1988 the club was losing $1 million a month . But he also runs 26-year-old Texas Stadium , the prototype for the new generation of football stadiums . Texas Stadium pioneered the use of luxury suites , and today it has 379 of them-by far the most in the league . By using all that extra revenue , Jones has continually signed pricey free agentsmost notably all-purpose playmaker Deion Sanders-who have helped the Cowboys win three Super Bowls since 1993 . In the wake of the team 's resurgence on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lease rates for the suites , ranging from $250,000 to $1.5 million per term of lease . This coming season the boxes are projected to draw between $30 million and $40 million , which , according to investment bank Houlihan Lokey , by itself covers most of Jones ' entire player payroll . Even better , in 1996 , the last year the Cowboys won the title , the team earned $39 million in operating income on gross revenues of $130 million . Photograph RANGERS FANS Photograph THE SOUVENIR SHOP // If there 's a downside to this new system of stadium economics in the NFL , it 's the increasing polarization of the league into haves and have-nots . Take the Cincinnati Bengals , which plays in a 27year-old stadium with a meager 20 suites expected to generate less than $1 million in revenue this coming season . Says Bengals owner Michael Brown : " Without stadium revenues we wo n't produce enough to stay viable , let alone competitive on the field . And in our business , all the teams have to be healthy enough economically , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't stay a have-not forever . He 'll have his new stadium in 2000 , complete with 104 luxury boxes . Seven other new NFL stadiums will also be open for play by 2000 , and plans are in the works for ten more to be erected in the next decade . In the NFL , as in other pro sports , an edifice complex has clearly - and necessarily-become an essential part of team ownership . Still , you should n't forget that sports results sometimes defy logic , even the unassailable logic that big stadium revenues translate into superior teams these days . The New Jersey Devils , a team that plays in an outdated , relatively low-yield arena , won the National Hockey League 's Stanley Cup in 1995 . In baseball , the Atlanta Braves managed to get to four World Series in the 1990s while laboring in funky old Fulton County Stadium .

At first glance it might appear that the Pack , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , blue-collar Wisconsin town , might be another trend buster . After all , the team plays in frigid , 40-year-old Lambeau Field , a stadium that generates a mere $5 million in annual luxury-box revenue . But Packers President Robert Harlan says the team may someday allow a corporation to put its name on Lambeau-the very place where the legendary Vince Lombardi once patrolled the sidelines . In the new world of corporate involvement in sports , it seems , nothing at all is sacred . <p>
