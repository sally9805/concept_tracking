<p> The Democrats ' plan to clean up campaigns wo n't make politicians kick the Big Dollar habit . I know ; I was addicted once myself <p> Last May , President Clinton unveiled his plan to change corrupt campaign practices . The president calls his proposal the " most comprehensive reform of the political system in the history of this country . " I call this a scam . If every line of the President 's legislation were adopted tomorrow , the same corruption in Washington would continue  --  at conveniently reduced prices . The checks that buy the votes would still be signed by those who sign them now . Corporate executives and the wealthy would still call the tune . <p> I grew up in politics . My father rose from San Francisco district attorney to state attorney general to governor of California . He beat Richard Nixon , lost to Ronald Reagan , and missed just one Democratic National Convention in 50 years . I have been present at hundreds and hundreds of fundraising events . Maybe thousands . I have lost count , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the early seventies . <p> Contributions of $10,000 and even $100,000 are not unfamiliar to me . I have spent days on end cajoling all manner of rich and powerful people out of money to mount multimillion dollar campaigns for the U.S. Senate , the California governorship , and the presidency . More recently , as chairman of the Democratic Party of California , I collected more millions . In 1989 , for example , I organized a dinner honoring Mario Cuomo at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Los Angeles and raised $750,000 . In 1990 , I put on another dinner with Lloyd Bentsen at the Fairmount Hotel in San Francisco and collected $550,000 . I know what I am talking about . This is about corruption , not a mere " money chase . " <p> I know that our entire campaign system rests on the twin pillars of $1,000 donations , bundled and multiplied 10 , 20 or even 100 times , and the massively repetitive TV ads and expensive mailings these $1,000 donations buy . House Speaker Thomas Foley recently said that it is a " tremendous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more corrupt . That depends on what you call corruption . <p> The corruption I speak of is not legally defined as a felony-at least not yet-but rather is the current method of paying for American elections . You take money from the richest and best connected 1 percent to get elected and then pretend that this does not affect your judgment . <p> Jess Unrah , the famous speaker of the California State Assembly in the sixties , coined the phrase , " money is the mother 's milk of politics . " He said that you had no business in politics unless " you could take their money , eat their food , drink their booze , f  --  their women and then vote against them . " That 's what I call either naive or skillfully self-deceptive . <p> As you might expect , Speaker Foley also defends political action committees ( PACs ) , calling them " one of the most effective ways for people to make smaller contributions . " Who is he kidding ? PAC donations are managed and guided by the same elite who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in charge of " government relations . " The only difference between PACs and individual high rollers is that PACs are permitted to ante up $5,000 . Of course , there are labor and liberal PACs , but these mainly act as a foil to the better-financed corporate and trade association PACs . Worse , the operatives of the socalled progressive PACs often take on the Beltway perspective of their corporate counterparts . Jeffrey H. Birnbaum of The Wall Street Journal describes it this way : " . . . lawmakers and lobbyists moving together in a largely closed and isolated system , discussing decisions that affect millions of other Americans . " <p> For the Democratic leadership , the temptation is denial , to believe that they are good but practical men able to govern for all while relying on money from the few . For all the incumbents , Republican and Democrat , the tendency is to fight every effort to reduce the role of the wealthy . Enjoying as they do $135,000 a year salaries , the best health care , and innumerable perks , these men and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constituents face . And it all begins with those fundraising dinners . Pac it in <p> President Clinton 's campaign " reform " proposals do nothing to stop this subversion of democracy . True , the cost of running some campaigns would go down under his plan , but the same type of people would remain in charge by writing large checks beyond the reach of most Americans . Only those candidates who attract the favor of the powerful will be able to amass large campaign warchests to run successfully . For the House , Clinton proposes business as usual with the same $5,000 PAC and $1,000 individual donations . The voluntary $600,000 spending limit is above the 1992 average of $557,000 spent by incumbents and way above the $169,000 spent by challengers . And even this so-called spending limit  --  which applies to those candidates who accept public funds  --  is deceptive . Candidates who win their primary by less than 20 percent can spend an additional $150,000 in the general election ; fundraising costs up to $75,000 are also exempt from the limit . All this is indexed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at roughly $900,000 in 1996 . <p> And the public financing provisions of the plan are so limited that they do not remove the need to raise large sums to win office . For House races , candidates may receive up to $200,000 in media vouchers to purchase radio , television , and print ads and postage only after they have first raised $75,000  --  not a trivial sum for those without affluent supporters . Taken as a whole , Clinton 's plan leaves intact a system dependent on the same narrow sources of money . <p> For the Senate , expenditure limits are set between $1.2 million and $5.5 million , depending on the state 's voting age population , but this " cap " does not include up to $2.75 million for primary election campaigning or cost of living adjustments . The Senate , which has already passed its version , bans PAC contributions but allows candidates to keep collecting the coveted $ 1,000 checks from individuals . Under pressure , the Democratic leadership , instead of fighting , quickly capitulated to the Republicans and stripped publicly funded media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Congress so incapable of changing the status quo ? I suggest you look at the March 4 , 1993 , Federal Election Commission report on the last election . It shows that congressional campaign spending jumped 52 percent  --  from $446 million in 1990 to $678 million in 1992 . That 's more than a million dollars for each of the 535 members of Congress . House incumbents had a 5-to-1 financial advantage over challengers in 1992 ; senators had a 3-to-1 edge . And of the Top 40 House recipients of PAC money in 1992 , each and every one were incumbents , and 37 were Democrats . Congressmen Richard Gephardt , Vic Fazio , Dan Rostenkowski , David Bonior , and John Dingell  --  certainly among the House 's most influential leaders  --  ranked one through five , raising a total of over $5 million from PACs . In the Senate , 25 of the Top 40 PAC recipients were Democrats . <p> We also learn that as a group House Democratic incumbents received more than 50 percent of their $126 million in campaign checks from PACs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party of Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman , of the " common man , " of the hard-pressed wage earner , of those who suffer despair in our cities ? <p> To understand how deep the hostility to change is , consider what happened to President Clinton 's plan as it went through the process . Before the plan was even announced , the incumbents served notice that they would accept no drastic changes . Clinton bowed to their wishes , abandoning his modest campaign commitment to limit PAC contributions to $1,000 . He also went along with postponing the law 's effective date from 1994 to 1996 . Then , without bothering to hold hearings in which citizens could meaningfully participate , the Senate took up the weakened bill and desultory debate ensued . Senator Paul Wellstone offered an amendment to limit contributions to $100 . Just 13 senators voted yes . More amendments . More discussion . There was little public notice or media attention . Then public financing was stripped away . But the $1,000 gift remained sacrosanct and the status quo-what Kevin Phillips calls " greedlock " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ingrained practice of money politics attacks and then kills every attempt at genuine reform . <p> The great constitutional principle of " one person , one vote " has been betrayed and in its place we find a rogue system where the pursuit of " one dollar , one vote " takes over . And the obvious way for the public to learn about this  --  informed press coverage  --  is infrequent and thin . Reporters thrive on political combat and in the matter of campaign reform , there is more consensus than conflict among the incumbents . Their debate lacks intensity , and that discourages coverage . The New York Times and The Washington Post ritually editorialize about the need for campaign reform but dutifully embrace the empty packages the leadership puts together . Is anyone listening ? Does anyone care ? <p> What we have here is sham and pretense . The congressional incumbents will not clean up a system that insures them a flow of money to smother their opponents . As the electoral process now functions , it is the exception rather than the rule for citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this anti-democratic system , the objective of any prudent candidate must be to amass enough money to deter potential opposition , or failing that , to ensure that the quantity of their campaign messages overwhelms the opposition . For this plutocratic endeavor , money from the top 1 percent is almost always a sine qua non . Dollar bills <p> This money driven system corrodes intelligent debate and rewards those candidates who win disproportionate access to the voters ' minds through paid media repetition . It is not what you stand for but whether you can buy five or ten times more media or mail than your opponents . It is this evil that the President and Congress must address if there is to be honest reform . To radically reduce the influence of corporate and high income donors , the $1,000 donation must be cut to $100 and PAC contributions outlawed . When I was running for president in 1992,1 asked hundreds of audiences across the country to raise their hands if they had never given $1,000 to a politician . Virtually all hands would go up , accompanied by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prerogative of the few . A $100 limit , which is within reach of most Americans , together with the following reforms , will make the system democratic  --  in practice as well as in theory . Full public matching funds must be given for each $100 donation after a reasonable threshold has been attained . Such a system operates in presidential nominating campaigns and Democrats and Republicans alike gladly avail themselves of this form of public support . Significant amounts of free TV and radio broadcast time featuring the candidates addressing the viewers must be made available . Candidates would qualify by collecting a reasonable number of petition signatures . It is simply impossible for most people to ever see or hear a political candidate except through the mass media . Without exaggeration , the mail and public airwaves are the functional equivalent today of the public square of old . That is why their political use must be democratized . <p> Only a plutocracy sanctions the rationing of political debate based on the ability to pay . I believe every broadcast outlet must devote at least one hour a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forums in exchange for the licenses we the people grant them . During this period , the stations would present the debates during the same primetime hour every night , free of film clips and gimmicks . Meanwhile , privately paid candidate advertising would be outlawed , breaking politics free of the 30- or 60-second commercial in which manufactured images dominate political debate . Incumbents and challengers alike could no longer use uplifting music and family dogs to sell a candidate like a Jeep Wagoneer . This would also end the dependency on quick , distorting sound-bite attacks . If the courts hold this unconstitutional , then an alternative rule should mandate that each time one candidate or party buys time , the opposition will be granted free , equivalent exposure . The postage for at least two district wide mailings must be made available free to all candidates in both the primary and general elections . In House races where TV is not practical more mailings should be authorized . Once the costs of media advertising are out of the equation , it makes sense to set low limits on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the incumbents . With free TV and postage , this becomes feasible . Drastically limit the incumbent 's franking privilege during election years . Even in non-election years , franking should be substantially cut , stopping the flow of newsletters members of Congress mail out only to propagandize the voters . <p> I know that nothing less will alter the profoundly disordered state of American politics . Greedlock can not be overcome by half measures . The first step is to expose the empty reforms now before the Congress . Unless reporters , activist groups , and fed-up citizens do this now , while Congress debates the issue , the charade will continue . <p> by Edmund G. Brown Jr . <p> <p> Edmund G.
