It is 11:45 on a sunny Friday morning as accountants Harry Argires , Jeff Miceli and Todd Schneider amble out of their downtown Chicago office building dressed in khakis , golf shirts and baseball caps . The three are on their way to play golf , but they wo n't be away for long . In two hours they will be back in their charcoal pinstripes , sitting around a table discussing amortization while dreaming about that blown birdie putt on number 3 , the bogey on the sixth hole and the chip-in from the fringe on 8. // Argires , Miceli and Schneider are on their way to Illinois Center Golf , a lush nine-hole course and driving range a mere 50 yards from their office . Billed as " the country 's first-ever urban golf course , " ICG features a 1,000-yard par-27 layout with bunkers and an island green , a 92-stall driving range , full-time instructors , a pro shop with locker rooms , free parking and a restaurant  --  all within walking distance of Michigan Avenue shops and skyscrapers . // " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director of golf Scott Szybowicz . " Where else can you play a challenging round of golf at lunch , with a spectacular view of the city skyline , then walk back to the office for a two o'clock meeting ? " // While urban golf is nothing new in Japan , ICG is the first downtown course in a major United States city . Because the course 's holes range in length from 57 to 145 yards , a spin around the ICG nine takes less than an hour and a half . That 's perfect for the busy business duffer looking to get a fix on his lunch break . " You do n't have to take an entire day off work to play , " says Argires as he , Miceli and Schneider stroll up to the 1st tee . " We have a meeting in a few hours , but we 'll have no problem making it . " // The idea for ICG arose a few years ago , when an office-space glut in the Loop derailed plans for a complex of buildings on the site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unable to sell the parcel , which at the time contained an abandoned railroad yard , so they contacted Vintage Group USA , a Denver golf-course developer . Vintage Group got a 15-year lease on the property and a chance to create a U.S. golf novelty . // " We could n't afford to buy the land ourselves , " says Charles Tourtellotte , the president of Vintage Group . " It 's worth about $100 million . So this is a win-win situation for everybody involved . The landowners make a little money from the lease . The city gets a park with green grass . And we make a lot of money from the course , we hope . " // At $22 per round , and with full memberships beginning at $1,000 , ICG has seen plenty of the green stuff . Golfers have been walking and driving to the facility in steady numbers since its opening a year ago . Though the entrance is a little hard for first-timers to find because it is located 60 feet below street level on Lower Columbus Drive , the rookies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oversees the operation , says more than 12,000 people have toured the course . Most find the Dye Designs layout to be an amusing series of short yet tricky holes , with hilly fairways , hidden sand traps and manicured greens complemented by breathtaking vistas of such Chicago landmarks as the Sears Tower and the John Hancock Building . // " The view is incredible , " says Mary Lou Newbold , a national account manager for a hotel chain , who recently took a group of 50 women to ICG for the first time . " We play a different course every month , but at the other courses you do n't turn around and see the skyline of Chicago . " // If you do n't notice the skyline at ICG , there is a good chance that you 'll see some larger-than-life Chicago figures . Michael Jordan , who occasionally works out at a nearby health club , stopped by the day after Christmas to hit some balls off the covered , heated practice tees . And Ernie Banks , " Mr. Cub " himself , is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can say , " Let 's play two " and still get back to Wrigley Field in time to see the first pitch . // In creating the layout , ICG took a wide range of golfers into consideration . " Because of our location and clientele , we wanted to try to get not only the recreational golfer but also the good golfer , " says ICG designer Perry Dye , whose father is famed course designer Pete Dye . " A par-3 course is not traditionally known for attracting good golfers . But we tried to create a par-3 that required all different shots , figuring that the good golfer would recognize that and play the course . " // That 's not to say , however , that ICG would bring Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer to their knees . Many players shuffling around the course are beginners , practicing their chips and putts , or receiving instruction . " I wanted to learn the game because so many of my friends and associates were golfers , " says John Edelman , a public relations executive who joined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so this is very convenient for me . And this course is good for beginners because you can work through your shots and keep moving without slowing up the people behind you . " // As Edelman speaks , his playing partner and coworker , Dominic Scianna , nods vigorously . Scianna is a 17 handicapper who belongs to a pricey country club in the suburbs , but he too rates the ICG course as a decent blend of easy and difficult holes . " It 's a good course to work on your short game , " Scianna says . " That 's a big problem for a lot of golfers . And there are some pretty tough holes , like the island green on number 9. " // Surrounded by water and accessible only by a wooden bridge , the 142-yard 9th is ICG 's signature hole . By far the toughest on the course , it looks like a carbon copy of the 17th on Pete Dye 's Stadium Course at Sawgrass in Ponte Vedra Beach , Fla. , but it has one notable extra hazard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's an exact replica , ' " Perry Dye says . " I told him , ' No , mine 's a little better . Yours does n't have the wind swirling around it all day . ' " // Indeed , Windy City gusts can pose a problem to golfers trying to land tee shots on greens as close as 50 yards away . Traffic noise from nearby Lake Shore Drive also intrudes a bit on the serenity that is usually considered part of an enjoyable round of golf . But what the ICG course lacks in peace and quiet , it more than makes up for in convenience and architectural scenery . // " Look at that . What a spectacular view , " Schneider marvels as he plants a tee at number 4 and gazes up at the sweeping skyline . " I wonder if I could reach the Amoco Building with this drive . " // Players who are worried about smashing office windows with their errant Maxflis need not fear . Because most golfers tend to slice the ball , Dye designed the course to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way onto Lower Wacker Drive , no broken windows have been reported yet . // " Once in a while I 'll take a Big Bertha out of somebody 's bag , just in case , " Szybowicz says with a laugh . " But it 's a lot harder to hit a building than it looks . " // Rather than scorn the golf course as an attractive nuisance , many neighbors have embraced the facility as an improvement to the area . The 43-story Swiss ? tel , which overlooks the 9th hole , offers guests discounted greens fees and features the course in its brochures . " We consider ourselves blessed to have it at our doorstep , " says Robert Allegrini , a spokesman for the hotel . " Before , it was just a delinquent field . Now we have an amenity for our guests , especially Japanese ones . " // ICG 's success in acquiring such business partnerships may well lead to the development of more nine-hole courses in big cities across North America . Tourtellotte says plans are in the works for similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louis and Seattle , and a 220-yard , 50-station driving range with target areas and nets will soon be built on the roof of the Port Authority Bus Terminal in New York City . " Cities are finding out that this is a great interim use for property that would otherwise go undeveloped , " Tourtellotte says . // That , of course , would be just fine with Argires , Miceli and Schneider . After putting out on the 9th hole and beginning their short walk back to work , they give ICG solid ratings for convenience , cost and challenge . // " There 's one more thing I liked , " adds Miceli , ever the accountant . " I lost only one ball all day . "
