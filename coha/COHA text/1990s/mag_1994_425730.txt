A Foreign Way of Death Is America heading down the euthanasia path blazed by Holland ? Watch the results on Oregon 's Measure 16 . <p> A BREAKTHROUGH in Oregon will start a domino effect of law reform on assisted dying throughout America , " writes Derek Humphry , co-founder of the Hemlock Society , in a fund-raising letter on behalf of the Oregon initiative known as Measure 16 . If Oregon voters pass the initiative , it will mean that doctors , for the first time in American history , will be allowed to knowingly prescribe fatal overdoses of drugs . <p> Measure 16 is a case study in cynicism and subterfuge . The backers of the initiative assumed that Oregonians would reject any measure that appeared to be an outright legalization of euthanasia . So they wrote the proposal in minimalist terms , hoping to fool voters into believing that the measure would " only " permit physician-assisted suicide . But as Humphry 's letter makes clear , the authors of the initiative intend it to be the rock that starts the avalanche down euthanasia 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of public policy prohibiting doctor-induced death . <p> This is not an irrational approach for euthanasia advocates . Legalization proposals have been put forth before and repeatedly rejected by state legislatures and voters . This year in Michigan , Jack Kevorkian 's supporters were unable to gather enough signatures to qualify a euthanasia initiative for the ballot , despite a well-publicized petition drive . Indeed , experience has shown that opposition to legalizing euthanasia grows the more people learn about the topic . <p> And that is precisely the problem for opponents of the Oregon initiative . Coverage of the O. J. Simpson murder trial will be at its height in October , when most voters would normally begin to focus on the campaign . That may make it difficult for the truth about euthanasia to get through . So now may be the best time to analyze what passage of Measure 16 would mean , not only for Oregon but for the rest of us " dominoes . " Slide into Euthanasia <p> THE SOCIAL and moral consequences of legalizing doctor-induced death are already apparent in Holland , a nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bio-ethical future . Holland 's slide into euthanasia can be traced back to 1973 , when a Dutch judge refused to punish a doctor who had been convicted of killing her ailing mother by lethal injection . The judge ruled that the defendant physician had stayed within certain informal policy " barriers " against patient abuse , and so no legal sanction ( aside from one week of probation ) should apply . <p> That case and others like it led to the current state of Dutch law , which technically prohibits doctor-induced death but permits it to go unpunished if physicians stay within legislative guidelines . Under these guidelines , only patients who are experiencing unbearable pain and who repeatedly and voluntarily request death are supposed to be killed . In practice , Dutch physicians routinely ignore the rules . Here is just a sample of what is happening in the Netherlands , a mere 21 years after euthanasia made its first legal breakthrough : <p> According to the Remmelink Report , an official Dutch government survey of euthanasia practices , more than one thousand patients are involuntarily euthanized each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of three patients a day without permission of the patients or their families .  --  Some patients who are not terminally ill are euthanized . Indeed , they do not have to be physically ill to receive " deliverance , " the favorite euphemism among euthanasia advocates . The Dutch Supreme Court recently ruled that a psychiatrist acted properly when he " assisted " a physically healthy but depressed patient to die . ( The woman 's two children had died and her marriage had dissolved . ) <p> Babies born mentally retarded or with birth defects are being killed in their cribs by pediatricians . So common is this infant euthanasia that the Dutch Pediatric Association is drawing up guidelines for its practice .  --  The Dutch Patients ' Association , a disability-rights group , has found it necessary to distribute a wallet card to members instructing doctors that " no treatment be administered with the intention to terminate life . " <p> It is tempting to dismiss these problems as foreign to the U.S. experience . But a quiet revolution in ethics is being led by this nation 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path blazed by Holland . A May 26 , 1994 , editorial in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine opined that the time has come to restrict the right of profoundly disabled people to receive life-sustaining medical treatment . According to the editorial , restrictions could come in three forms : expanding the legal definition of death to include permanent unconsciousness ; legally limiting the health care a severely brain-damaged person would be entitled to receive ; or creating a legal presumption that those with severe disabilities would rather die than live ( reversing the current presumption in favor of life ) . <p> No matter how restricted these new guidelines were , you can bet they would soon be extended . In fact , conscious brain-damaged people are already being hustled into the grave . In 1993 , for example , a Vermont court approved the withholding of food and fluids from a brain-damaged man named Ronald Comeau because of " quality of life " considerations . ( See " The Right to Die , the Power to Kill , " NR , April 4 , 1994 . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michael Martin , another brain-damaged man , may not be as fortunate . ( See " Better Dead than Fed ? " NR , June 27 , 1994 . ) Mr. Martin is slated to die by dehydration and starvation with the approval of a Michigan probate court despite strong evidence that he has communicated a desire to live . The court ruled he is n't competent to choose life over death , so a pre-injury statement to his wife that he would not want to live in a dependent condition allows the state to approve his killing . ( A request for a hearing is currently pending before the Michigan Supreme Court . ) Eroding Guidelines <p> THE decisions to starve Ronald Comeau and Michael Martin were unethical under guidelines created by the AMA Council on Ethics and the Law in 1986 and reiterated in 1992 . The guidelines said it was ethical to withhold food and fluids only from patients who were " terminally ill " or " beyond doubt " permanently unconscious . Mr. Martin and Mr. Comeau are neither , proving that the protective limitations established by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guidelines in Holland are . Moreover , in response to such cases , the AMA has loosened the guidelines . A recently published opinion by the Council on Ethics and the Law deems it ethical to withhold food and fluids from conscious brain-damaged patients like Mr. Martin and Mr. Comeau . <p> Despite the ostensible concern for the welfare of patients , legalizing assisted suicide and euthanasia would be likely to increase the misery and suffering of the very people that doctor-induced death is supposed to help . This is the conclusion reached by the 25-member New York State Task Force on Life and the Law , a permanent commission created by Governor Mario Coumo in 1985 . In 1994 , after an intensive and lengthy investigation , the task force published a report entitled , " When Death Is Sought : Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia in the Medical Context . " <p> The task force found that the medical community is not doing a very good job of caring for severely ill and chronically suffering people . The task force reported , for example , that up to 60 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain . Moreover , terminally ill patients who become clinically depressed and suicidal often do not receive adequate mental-health intervention or anti-depressants . If doctors do such a poor job of relieving pain and depression now , when doctor-induced death is illegal , what kind of job will they do should killing a patient be considered just another " treatment option " ? <p> The task force also found that worries about a slippery slope are justified . It concluded that " clinical safeguards would not be realized " and that euthanasia policies that " hinge on notions of pain and suffering " would be " uncontainable . " The task force 's conclusions were unequivocal and unanimous : The dangers of legalizing assisted suicide and euthanasia " would far outweigh any possible benefits . " Furthermore , " the risks would be most severe for those who are elderly , poor , socially disadvantaged , or without good access to good medical care . " <p> As the task force and others who have studied the issue have concluded , there is little to gain by legalizing doctor-induced death and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voters to stop the avalanche , by voting no on Measure 16 . To do otherwise will unleash forces that will bring about devastating consequences not only in this country but eventually throughout the world . After all , if we can export rock n ' roll , we can export Dr. Kevorkian . <p> By Wesley J.
