Recycled Wood Is Showing Up in the Best Houses // Most of the trees harvested in the U.S. do n't get made into paper ; they 're used by the home building industry . In 1995 , Americans built 1.3 million new houses , with the average singlefamily home using more than 15,000 board feet of lumber , according to the National Association of Home Builders . This average home required the wood of 88 trees , or 3.2 acres of forest , says David McKeever of the U.S. Department of Agriculture 's Forest Service 's Forest Products Lab . But , as supplies of virgin wood drop and prices increase , some home builders are turning to an unlikely source of wood : demolition sites . Salvaging old lumber for re-use is nothing new . Today , however , homeowners can contract with builders who specialize in building with mostly recycled wood . Jonathan Orpin , a home builder in Shortsville , New York , recovers scrap wood from old buildings as they are torn down , and then recycles the wood into material for new homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible homes made of timbers with a history , " says Orpin . He and his crew take the old lumber they recover , plane and re-cut it , and use it in new houses-for framework and also for building cabinets and flooring . Orpin says his clients enjoy the added " character " of the old wood , with its nail holes , uneven sizes and antique coloration . Orpin points out , however , that reclaiming wood is not easy . He and a few other builders travel across the country searching for old buildings to salvage , and when they find material worth saving , they must carefully remove the timbers , inspect them , and arrange for shipping . At times , Orpin says , he has been known to patrol demolition sites with a few spare $50 bills in his hand to encourage equipment operators to protect large beams as they knock buildings to the ground .

" Fresh-cut timber warps and shrinks because it 's not completely dried . With the recycled wood , these problems are eliminated , " he says , adding another reason why he prefers to reuse : " I 'm a strong environmentalist . " Like other builders , he expresses concern about the heavy demand for virgin lumber and the effects of logging on habitat destruction . Because the practice is in its infancy , using recycled wood can wind up being more costly than using virgin timber . But Orpin finds that his clients are willing to pay more . " What we do may be more expensive , but it 's three to four times more energy efficient and will last three to four times as long , so the true costs are less , " he says . " I believe in what we do , but I am the first to say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or worse , Orpin points out , economics drives our consumption of resources . If virgin timber remains cheap , he says , we 're likely to go on using it . Steve Loken , president of the Center for Resourceful Building Technology in Missoula , Montana , says that the building industry needs reform . " We 're going to see a change in how we build houses , " he says . " The traditional materials that we 've used in the past-large , old-growth trees that we 've made into lumber-just are n't around anymore . " Loken is the first to admit that the home building industry is wasteful . He notes that on a per-capita basis , the U.S. uses more wood for homes and buildings than any other country . Furthermore , we waste 20 percent on the job site , he says . " When wood was cheap and plentiful , we practically threw it away , " says Loken . He notes that he used to work with trees 14 inches in diameter , but now must contend with logs half that size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forest ' and other alternative ways of putting houses together , " says Loken , who recently received an award from the Energy-Efficient Building Association . He designed and built a house that-from the outside-looks like a conventional home , but uses only one-sixth the regular amount of wood . Loken says he also tries to conserve raw materials by convincing his clients to build smaller . " There is a move to smaller , saner houses rather than those huge starter castles that appear in glossy magazines , " says Loken , who points out that , ironically , he builds the biggest houses for the smallest families . But wood recycling is hardly an elitist enterprise . On the mean streets of New York City , Bronx 2000 's Big City Forest division has turned recycled wood , mostly from industrial pallets , into a thriving business . Big City Forest , which emphasizes community-based enterprise , has created 20 jobs in its wood recycling business , and has reclaimed some 9,000 tons of wood from 180,000 discarded shipping pallets and crates . " There are 600 million pallets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City Forest 's environmental affairs advisor . " Most of them are turned into wood chips . We 're the only people taking the material in whole form and adding value to it . " Dimino says that since most of the pallets are made from hard woods , they are reusable as flooring , or as the raw material for architectural mill work , wooden plaques , and other uses . Prices are competitive with virgin suppliers , she says . And Lou Host-Jablonski is an architect who practices the old-fashioned style of recycling : He trash picks . " I hate to waste things , " he says . " I 've been a garbage picker ever since I was a little kid , and I 'm not afraid to admit it : ' Host-Jablonski put his scavenging techniques to the test earlier this year when he built an addition to his home . " Much of it I picked up off the street on trash collection day , " he says . " Wood has been plentiful and cheap for so many years . " But Host-Jablonski says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of recycled wood as the price of virgin timber goes up , he predicts . And there 's always trash to pick . <p>
