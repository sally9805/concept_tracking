<p> It 's 5:45 a.m. and John Anderson , former presidential candidate , is about to aid and abet human rights abuses in the Third World , the depletion of the ozone layer and testing on animals . <p> All before he even gets dressed . <p> And all without his knowledge . <p> Anderson , 71 , now teaching law at Nova University in Davie , Fla. , 13 years after his last failed presidential bid , is unwittingly supporting practices the unabashed liberal activist would otherwise oppose . <p> Do n't blame him , though . He 's probably still doing better on the index of social consciousness than you are . There are currently almost 160 known national boycotts called as social causes , and by the time the year is out , there should be an all-time high of more than 200 . Unless you buy nothing at all , you 're probably violating a boycott . <p> They cover the spectrum of consumer products , from the stuff you use to clean your oven , to the gas you put in your car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Blockbuster tape you just rented . <p> Right now , you might be - check that , you almost certainly are - supporting apartheid in South Africa or human rights abuses in Burma , giving money to companies with allegedly unfair labor practices , and financing tobacco companies ( even if you do n't buy tobacco products ) . <p> Yes , the Age of the Boycott is here , and it 's not just California grapes , anymore . <p> " " There 's probably the biggest boycott boom in history going on right now , " says Todd Putnam , a college dropout who has spent the last nine years tracking boycotts from his parents ' home in Seattle . As editor of the National Boycott News , he is an expert in a growth industry . <p> The industry is having growing pains , of course . Some boycotts are frivolous , others may have little merit , and still others exist only as rumors , victimizing companies that are not really being boycotted . <p> And some boycott activists are expanding the playing field to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agenda , even if the companies themselves are doing nothing deemed wrong . <p> Cesar Chavez and the United Farm Workers pioneered the boycott of mass public appeal with the first grapes boycott of the late ' 60s to protest migrant worker conditions . Still , until the Reagan era , there were so few boycotts at one time that you could count them on two hands . Then , says Putnam , " " in 1989 , with the Exxon Valdez spill , I think that is the point at which the American public remembered that there are boycotts . " <p> After the multitude of boycott efforts against Exxon , activists across the nation picked up on the notion . A recent example is a grass-roots effort by Cuban exiles against Mexico in retaliation for Mexico 's deportation last month of eight Cuban boat refugees . <p> " " Corporations are the ones calling the shots in this country , " says Putnam , 30 . They need an economic incentive to be socially responsible , and by buying their products , consumers are n't providing that incentive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies until you have responsible consumers . " Maybe so , but the American public is n't aware of all the boycotts going on . What happens when you call 200 boycotts and nobody comes ? If supporting corporate evils with hard-earned dollars is a crime , 250 million Americans are presumed guilty . <p> On this recent morning , Anderson 's kitchen was the scene of the crime , and the Hills Brothers coffee he drank was the smoking gun . Did n't he know that Hills Brothers is a subsidiary of Nestle , which markets baby formula to the Third World and in so doing , boycotters charge , contributes to infant deaths from malnutrition every year ? <p> No , he could n't have known , just like he could n't have known that his Stouffer 's frozen dinners were made by Nestle . What else was in this man 's kitchen ? <p> Let 's see here , there 's Nabisco Shredded Wheat . Nabisco , a subsidiary of R.J. Reynolds , is the target of several boycotts , one charging that R.J. Reynolds uses manipulative advertising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran an ad that trivialized violence against women . <p> What do you have to say for yourself , Anderson ? <p> " " Make a note of the fact that it is my wife that eats the Nabisco Shredded Wheat . I eat the Corn Flakes . " <p> Kellogg 's Corn Flakes ? <p> " " Only when they 're on sale . " <p> But Kellogg 's has not divested from South Africa . <p> Coca-Cola has n't fully divested , either , but the lettering on a big , red radio in Anderson 's kitchen urges people to " " Drink Coca-Cola . " In the refrigerator , we find Kraft Parmesan cheese . Kraft and its parent company , Philip Morris , are the target of several boycotts , including one that says Philip Morris , too , markets cigarettes to teen-agers . And that Miller Genuine Draft ? <p> Miller beer is a subsidiary of Philip Morris . <p> Moving to the bathroom , we find the bar of Zest soap Anderson used in the shower this morning . Zest is a product of Procter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ household products . Then there 's the Bausch &; Lomb eye drops Anderson used , the target of another animal-testing boycott . <p> Anderson is for gay rights , but he mailed his acceptance this same morning to speak at a conference in Denver , violating the gay rights boycott of that state . <p> And Anderson will have to stop listening to Bruce Springsteen . <p> The Boss , it seems , recently crossed two picket lines in Tacoma , Wash. , and despite his blue-collar image , the unions are boycotting him . <p> " " Well , there goes Springsteen . He blew it , " says Anderson , who adds that he would never cross a picket line . " " Now , I go back to Neil Diamond . " ( As far as we know , Neil Diamond is not being boycotted , though Diamond walnuts are . ) <p> It 's tough for even a well-intentioned , socially conscious liberal activist to keep up with all the boycotts these days . <p> The high-profile boycotts - the tuna boycott of the late ' 80s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tourism boycott of 1993 - have a chance to succeed because everyone hears about them and it 's easy to follow them . <p> The tuna boycott , launched in 1988 by Earth Island Institute , is the model . It had sympathetic victims - dolphins killed in tuna nets - and an attention-grabbing videotape , shot by biologist Sam LaBudde posing undercover as a cook on a fishing vessel . People at the grass-roots level - artists , politicians , schoolchildren - took up the cause . <p> Most importantly , Earth Island Institute targeted only the industry leader , Heinz , maker of Star-Kist , rather than confusing consumers with a long list of tuna products . The reasoning was that once the leader caved , the rest of the industry would fall in line , and it worked . <p> But most boycotts suffer mightily from a lack of publicity or a simple target . <p> " " As more mergers and takeovers happen , boycotts become more and more difficult , " Putnam says . " " There 's going to be a point where boycotts will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . will be somehow insulated economically from consumers . " For now , companies may be more vulnerable than some people think . Depending on profit margins , a boycott might decrease sales only 1 percent to 5 percent and still be effective , Putnam says . <p> That 's why Snapple Beverage Corp . was concerned when rumors spread that the company contributes to anti-abortion groups . <p> Snapple sent a letter to National Boycott News firmly denying the rumors , and the company would like to know how they started . Using consumer leverage , Boycott Colorado has explored uncharted territory by including Celestial Seasonings in its general boycott . Celestial Seasonings does n't support Amendment 2 , the statewide referendum , passed in November , that prohibits gay rights ordinances ; the company even includes homosexuals in its anti-discrimination policy . The company is considered guilty of not actively opposing Amendment 2 <p> " Just as politicians are expected to act on behalf of their constituents , more and more , businesses are expected to act on behalf of their consumers , " Putnam says . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Nash worried . Nash , president of the National Association of Corporate Directors , a private nonprofit group that deals with the responsibilities of corporate governance , does n't believe such boycotts are justified . <p> " " If I try to force my will on you through boycotting , and then cause a lot of other innocent people to be hurt , then I do n't think that 's right , " Nash says . " " A group of people are trying to force the company to take a specific stand , which many of its employees , or the general public , may not be in agreement with . " <p> Boycott blackmail ? Not so , argues Putnam . <p> " " These types of boycotts are not a form of blackmail ; rather they attempt to hold business accountable for their activity , and inactivity , as it were , " he says . <p> Still , the Celestial Seasonings boycott raises a question about all boycotts motivated by social causes : What 's good corporate behavior ? <p> Some companies that are being boycotted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully divesting from South Africa , Procter &; Gamble for not stopping animal testing - believe they are being socially responsible . Coke has been working for a peaceful transition of government in South Africa , and Procter &; Gamble has greatly reduced animal testing and continues to look for alternatives , Putnam says . <p> Nevertheless , the Age of the Boycott has dawned upon us . <p> After a morning of confronting the overwhelming corporatization of his own modest apartment , Anderson is getting into his brown 1970 Buick , a General Motors car , to drive to work . A boycott of GM recently ended and GM probably was n't being boycotted when he bought the car anyway , but Anderson is beginning to ponder these issues . <p> " " I never thought of that in 1970 , " he says with a laugh . " " See , I was uninitiated . "
