Land grabber , neighborhood despoiler , wheeler-dealer  --  those are the kinds of labels that stick to an urban real estate developer . Concerned environmentalist would not be on the list . But Douglas Durst is a developer with a green streak . And if he 's not ready to be lionized by the Sierra Club , you could at least call him the greenest of New York City 's megadevelopers . <P> Durst , 55 , the third-generation president of the family-run Durst Organization , prefers to be called environmentally responsible . " I do n't like the term green , " he says . " Any building , after all , is environmentally disruptive . " His latest disruption is a 48-story glass-and-concrete tower that looms over Times Square . It boasts such eco-conscious features as solar-energy panels , on-site electrical generation , internal waste chutes to ease recycling , huge low-glare windows that reduce artificial lighting needs , pumps to circulate fresh air , and nontoxic building materials . <P> Unfortunately , the laudable environmental goals were overshadowed from the start by sloppiness and tragedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injured as a result of construction disasters , which included two fires and the collapse of a scaffolding that forced the streets of Times Square to be sealed off for several weeks . None of this had anything to do with creating a green building , but it gave Four Times Square ( its official name ) a bad rep and a cynic 's nickname : " Times Square Titanic . " Some newly ensconced employees of the Conde Nast magazine empire , the building 's principal tenant , even contemplated extra life insurance . Then there were the break-in glitches , such as too-cold air conditioning , balky elevators and improperly installed locks . <P> While appalled by the misfortunes and embarrassed by the start-up snafus , Durst still sees his building as the leading edge in high-rise construction . " We felt we would be creating an example here . Others would have to follow . " He notes , for instance , that his tenants breathe air that is 50% fresher than that in most offices . That , along with an abundance of natural light , could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to some studies . Durst calls this " the biggest argument for green buildings . If you can make people more efficient , that 's a huge saving . " <P> He could n't do all he wanted to . Financial considerations contributed to cutbacks in the number of solar panels and non-polluting fuel-cell power generators . Nonetheless , Durst has drawn a nod from environmental advocates . " This is a good first effort , " says Joseph Romm , executive director of the Center for Energy and Climate Solutions in Washington . " The skyscraper is the symbol of American architecture , and Four Times Square has changed the way we think about them . " <P>  --  By Christopher Hallowell/New York
