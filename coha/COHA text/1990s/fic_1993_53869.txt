JAY DUNN KNOWS that his rain dance is not working . By the light of the breaking day , he pulls on his work boots and Dekalb cap before stepping out the screen door of the farmhouse . It 's still cool at this hour of the morning . There are 250 baby pigs in birthing crates , and Jay knows that if he does n't feed the thirty sows when they wake up , they 'll eat their own rather than go hungry . <p> Every year he does his rain dance , hoping downpour and drought will balance . It is the dance of forgetfulness , where he tries to forget that the dance is for himself , not for the rain . The dance is his work . Trying to control everything he can because he knows he has no real control over the rain . The rain plays by its own rules . <p> By now , the end of the fourth week of March , it should have rained four or five inches , with fifteen or twenty inches of snowfall the winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal , but enough rain fell in the spring that the corn and beans resisted the effects of the drought . Production was off , but not too far off . This year , there was little snow , and nothing but a few sprinkles so far this spring . In the yard , Jay puts a hand on the ground and feels that it has not rained again . There is not even dew . <p> Jay walks into the grinding room of the old barn . He turns on the lights and releases ten bushels of corn and five of beans into the grinder 's hopper . He pours in an antibiotic pack , a gallon of soy oil , releases the safety and pushes the grinder 's start button . As soon as the grinder moves , the sows begin to scream in the birthing crates in the adjacent confinement hall . Jay puts on a breathing mask , turns off the propane heaters , kills the lights , and walks into the noisy hall . <p> Even with the mask on , the earthy smell of shit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uses a flashlight to see the release for the first overhead window . With a tug on the chain , the spring-loaded window opens , revealing a square of bachelor-button-blue early morning sky . The grinder finishes and dispenses the feed to the sows , who shut up immediately . Jay opens the rest of the overheads and checks the crates . Each crate is eight by ten , made from wooden slats , and contains a sow and her piglets . Everything looks okay . <p> He walks out through the grindery and around the house to the equipment shed , where he steps up into the cab of the tractor ( a John Deere he bought two years ago and will be paying on for twenty ) . As he starts the engine , he hears the ring of the telephone 's outside bell . The only one who would call at this hour is Debbie , he thinks . Jay and Debbie have been sleeping together off and on for about a year . Not every night ( she works in town and it 's thirty minutes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite in love with her . On the fourth ring the answering machine picks up . <p> He pulls the tractor out of the shed , drives back to the hog barn , and steps out onto the running board . Looking at the deepening blue sky , he says out loud , " Another fucking beautiful day . " Standing here , he can see the south side of his farm , eighty acres that he will have seeded by late today . <p> The south part of the farm abuts Highway 3 , a county road , from Flinerman 's old place to the Bogh 's . Neither family farms . Flinerman 's son packs beef for Iowa Beef Products , and the Boghs live in California somewhere . Their land is rented to Consolidated and is already planted , Jay notices , shaking his head . If it does n't rain , their work will probably be a tax write-off ; year-to-year survival is not part of the big operation 's world . <p> Jay hops down from the tractor , leaving it running to warm up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the confinement building . The pigs are done eating . Jay walks through the building and out the great door . Turning on the honey wagon , he lets it suck up the muck from the drainage pit beneath the crates . When he hears it pulling air , he shuts it off and , though he knows it 's not near full , checks the level . He walks back through the great door to the grinder , turns on the sprayer and begins to spray out the walls of the drainage pit , rechecking the pigs . This time through , he sees that the new sow has rolled over on two piglets . He gets a shovel and scoops them up , carries them down to the end of the pit and drops them in . After he finishes spraying , he hoses down the shovel . He pulls the great doors closed and walks back through the hall to the grindery . <p> From the tractor , planting , Jay watches Andy Kelly 's black Chevrolet roll to a stop beside Highway 3 . Andy steps out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing a tie . Jay pulls the tractor to a stop and hops down . A light wind picks up a thin layer of dusty topsoil from the Consolidated 's field across the road and whips it past Andy and over the highway to Jay 's field . Andy is new to town but Jay likes him anyway because he makes no pretense of understanding life in a town of 7,500 . But he works at it . He 's a young guy , twenty-five , sent over from Chicago to manage the Farm Mutual office . " Hey , asshole , " Jay yells to Andy as Andy walks down through the ditch . <p> At the fence where Jay is , Andy takes off his sunglasses and reaches out to Jay , who shakes his hand . " Getting it all in ? " <p> " Slowly but surely . What sends you out this way ? " Jay arches his back and stretches . <p> " A pig farmer named Dick Schultz , " Andy says , squinting , putting a foot on the bottom rail of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schultz of Schultz/Pew Implements in Humboldt . Sold me that tractor . " Jay juts a thumb over his shoulder to the $102,000 machine that sits quiet . <p> " Well , he should have followed his father into implements , " Andy says , looking at the ground . " His pigs have transmissible gastroenteritis . " <p> Jay whistles out a falling note , shaking his head . " TGE . Sucks . Sows pass it to the young . Dissolves their stomach lining ; they die of dehydration . Does n't kill the sows , though . Hope they got it contained . " <p> Without looking up , Andy asks , " You at risk ? " <p> Jay laughs and leans on the top rail . " Nah , not bad . County folks 'll stop it . Just have to get rid of the dead right . " <p> " Thank God , " Andy says , meeting Jay 's eyes . " He called about making a claim . " <p> " Ask him if he had visitors in the confinement building . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Probably was n't , though . " <p> " Ever been inside it ? " <p> " Not with pigs . " <p> " Why is that ? " <p> Jay looks across the road at the Consolidated 's work . " People carry all kinds of diseases . The new confinements are almost airtight . Anything gets in 's serious . " When the company farms get big , there wo n't be any stopping things like TGE : one man might work in five or ten huge confinements doing one job . Jay blinks hard . " How many 'd he lose ? " <p> " A little better than a thousand head , " <p> " Fuck a running dog . That 's bad . " Jay runs his hand through his hair ; sweat collects in his palm . <p> " Know anything about what shape he 's in ? " <p> " Between us ? Dad holds the note on the whole place . Brand-new buildings , but no land . " Then in a voice so low that it 's almost inaudible over the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shorts last winter . Paid too much for feed . " <p> " Well , hog futures are up right now because of the rain , so the claim 's pretty big . That should help him , " Andy says , standing straight up . <p> For a moment both men are silent . Dick 's got to be in the hole pretty bad from last winter , Jay thinks . With the drought like it is no one 's buying machinery , so his old man ca n't help him . He 's so new , he 's got to have a hell of a debt load . And no land capital . Insurance only covers cost , not time spent . If he 's in debt , he ca n't borrow to breed and feed without land for collateral . The boys across the road will be at Dick 's doorstep within a week , asking if he needs help . <p> " Yeah , " Jay says , and smacks Andy on the shoulder . He looks at the rows across the highway . They look like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows he 'll have a higher yield than they will . That 's what 's wrong with these big crews . Too many variables . Course , if it does n't rain , wo n't matter , there wo n't be any yield for anybody . Either way , it 's too late for Dick Schultz . <p> Inside the back porch , Jay kicks off his work boots and starts the answering machine . It rewinds for a long time . Much longer than usual . He expects to hear Debbie , asking him about plans for later . The machine whistles , and the first call is a voice he does n't know . " Yes , hello ? Mr. Dunn ? This is the Good Samaritan Nursing Home , can you please call Mr. Johnson here ? Thank you . " <p> Jay looks at the machine and thinks that they want to remind him to pick up his dad for the weekend , just as they have done one weekend a month since his mother died . He walks through the kitchen door to get some lunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know says , " Mr. Dunn ? This is the Good Samaritan Nursing Home , can you please call Dr. Faber here ? Thank you . " Jay leans back into the doorway . Dr. Faber ? <p> The machine whistles and there are no words , just dial tone . Must be a salesman . <p> The fourth message is Debbie . " Hi Jay . It 's me . It 's about eleven . Call me about tonight , okay ? Love you . " He looks at the stove clock : twelve thirty . <p> The machine whistles again , and there is no message . He opens the fridge and picks up the Miracle Whip , ham , a loaf of bread , and an onion . <p> The next message is the voice he does n't know again , from the nursing home . " Mr. Dunn ? It is urgent that you call Dr. Faber here at 546-8678 , right away . " Jay puts the sandwich stuff on the table and looks at the machine , the refrigerator door still open . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Jay says out loud . His voice echoes on the linoleum . Whistles , no message . He steps through the doorway . Whistles , no message . Panicked now , he picks up the phone . The machine whistles , and Jay is frozen by the noise that is usually calming , that usually reminds him he is not alone . <p> The voice this time is his brother Dodge , whom he has n't seen in three years . " Jay , it 's Dodge . Call me . Now . " The message says nothing more , but Jay sits down on the kitchen step . <p> The machine whistles , clicks to a stop , and begins to rewind . <p> Shakily , Jay dials his older brother 's number . It rings once . " Dodge , it 's Jay , just tell me . " <p> " It 's Dad . He had another stroke this morning early . Jay , he 's dead . The nursing home just called me . Where were you ? " <p> Jay does n't say anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at it . Dodge sounds very far away . Farther than his office at the university in Texas . Farther than the twelve years between them . Funny , Jay thinks looking past the phone to the grain silo , Dodge sounds like he 's in the grain silo , his voice echoing and ringing against the sheet-metal walls . <p> " Jay ? You there ? " <p> Jay 's name pulls him back , and he lifts the phone into place . " Yeah . Yeah , I 'm here . " <p> " They 're taking him to Luedtke 's Funeral Home . One of us needs to call them and take care of the details . I thought you should , since you 're there . I booked a flight out for late this afternoon . I 'll get into Des Moines about six . I 'll rent a car and drive out to the house . " <p> " Look , I 'll drive down and get you . You do n't need to rent a car . " <p> " No , I know you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can you call Luedtke 's ? " <p> " Yeah , call Luedtke 's . " <p> " I should get out there a little after eight . " <p> " Okay . " <p> When Jay hangs up the phone he says out loud , " My dad died . " The words sound crazy to him . It 's spring . I 'm planting . I have fifty acres left to put in . Dick Schultz is going under . Only Debbie was supposed to call . The equipment shed needs another coat of paint , and there 's that crack in the floor of the confinement hall that needs to be plugged . <p> He opens the phone book to the funeral home and dials the number , sets the details . <p> As he is dialing the church , a blue Chrysler pulls into the lane . Jay sets the phone down and opens the back door . It 's Pastor Kramer , Jay realizes as the car pulls to a stop in the drive . Pastor Kramer steps out of the car , hat in hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six feet ; he played semipro football , Jay remembers . <p> " Thanks for coming out , " Jay says as the old man puts on his hat and extends a hand to him . Pastor Kramer 's hand is warm and fleshy , as if lotioned repeatedly . The big man steps into the back porch , removes his hat . <p> " I 'll take it by that you 've heard already , " the pastor says , looking down into Jay 's eyes . It is the look that Jay remembers from childhood , the one that stops fidgety children from ten pews away . <p> " From Dodge . He said it was a stroke . " <p> " Yes , I was over there this morning when it happened . " <p> " Can you tell me why no one came to get me ? " <p> " Son , up until an hour ago , it did n't seem very bad . He had stabilized , and they knew they 'd reach you . Shortly past eleven , he had another . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " So he fought it . " Jay looks around the small porch . Sees his heavy winter coat , the work-glove box , the aerial photograph of the farm his dad had made . <p> " His heart beat for a full five minutes after he passed . But when the Lord says it 's time to come home , there 's no sense in holding back . I was with him the whole time : there was no pain . " <p> " You were close , " Jay says , thinking , My mother made those curtains . Dad took the basement door off . Built in the phone table . <p> " We go back a ways . No doubt about that . He was a hell-raiser at your age . " <p> " Dad ? " Jay looks at the old man . <p> " Until he met your mother , your granddad could n't control him for anything . Course , we did some dumb things back then . " The old man smiles and looks away . Jay sees that Pastor Kramer is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two men were . <p> " Would you like to deliver the eulogy ? I do n't think I can do it , and you knew him better than most , " Jay says . <p> " Yes , I suppose I did . I 'd be honored . It 's strange how easy and difficult it is to eulogize a close friend . " <p> " I 'd imagine so . " <p> After Pastor Kramer leaves , Jay goes back into the kitchen he grew up in . His parents moved into town about ten years ago . Dad was n't much good by then . Mom died of congestive heart failure and Dad started getting older faster and faster , the farm life catching up with him . Jay makes a sandwich for himself . Opens a can of soup and pours it into a pot on the stove . At it begins to heat up , he walks through the kitchen and front room , then goes upstairs and gets sheets and blankets for the second bedroom out of the closet . He drops them on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to Dodge 's . The room smells dusty and he leans across the bed to open a window . The frame sticks , and he climbs onto the bed for better leverage . The window wo n't budge . He pushes up on the sash , hard and steady . The board gives a little and then rips free . <p> " Goddamn it ! " He walks back downstairs intending to get a screwdriver . When he gets to the kitchen he smells the soup , boiling and burnt . " Son of a bitch ! " He turns the stove off and picks up the padded handle , dropping the whole pan in the sink . " Shit , shit , shit , " he says , turning on the tap . Black flecks begin to rise to the top of the red soup as the water fills the pan . He squeezes in dish soap , turns off the tap , puts his boots on and kicks open the back door . <p> Coming up the lane is a dark green Cadillac , raising a thick cloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sees it 's Morty Sitzmann , his lawyer , a short , balding man who is still fairly young , though he does n't look or act it . The car pulls almost up to him before it stops . " Mort , " Jay says , raising a hand but no smile when the driver emerges . <p> " Hello , Jay , thought I better come on out and make sure things are clear with you . " The two men shake hands and Jay begins to walk towards the barn . <p> " Thanks . " <p> " It 's nothing , " Mort says , following . " I just heard . I think it 's usually better to get this kind of thing out of the way early . You 've got plenty to be thinking about . " <p> " It 's a busy time , all right . " Jay goes through the door to the grindery and into the main barn . <p> Mort follows behind him . " Have you spoken with your brother ? " <p> " He 's on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll make things easier . " <p> " Look , does this really need to be done now ? " Jay says , turning on the hose to water the hogs . " I got a lot of work to do . " He squeezes the trigger gently , sending a fine spray from the nozzle . <p> " Oh . I thought you might want to have a few ideas together about your brother 's part of the farm . " <p> Jay releases the trigger on the hose . " What ? " <p> " It is part his , you know . " <p> " Oh , shit . Great , a partner . " <p> " It 's a sizeable inheritance , especially with the work you 've done on it since your folks moved into town . " <p> " You mean he owns half of my farm ? He has n't done any work here since he graduated college . " <p> " Well , that 's of no consequence . " Mort lifts one foot and checks the bottom . " He only owns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I imagine , that you would stay on . Of course , you can probably buy your brother out for half that , around a hundred forty thousand , " he says . <p> Jay drops the hose . " Dollars ? " The hose throws out a short blast of water which falls as a mist over them . <p> " Yes , well it 's not all that bad . " Mort checks the other foot . He has stepped in something . <p> " It 's not ? Where in the hell am I supposed to get that ? " <p> " You do own the other seventy percent outright . You could sell some land , eighty acres should do it , or mortgage part , " Mort says , scraping the sole of his foot on one of the crate rails . " Of course , if it does n't rain soon , there 'll be a lot of land on the market , and the value will come down . " The sow lifts its snout towards him and exhales sharply . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> " Yes , well , as your lawyer , I thought you should be prepared . " <p> " This is turning into a great fucking day , " Jay says as he turns his hands palms up . <p> " My advice is to feel your brother out while he 's here . Give him a day to realize how much he hates the farm before you talk to him about money . " <p> " Okay , Mort . I 'm going to need some time to sort this out . Can I call you in a day or two ? " <p> " Sure , but remember , we should try to get this settled with your brother before too long . " <p> " Okay , Mort , thanks . Look , I got ta get back to work . " Jay sprays the crate rail down , washing the dirt from Mort 's shoe away . <p> " You should try to get something in writing before he leaves , though . Call me on Monday . " <p> " I 'll try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and goes back to misting the SOWS . <p> " Oh , I almost forgot . When 's the service ? " <p> " Sunday , two . Up the road . " <p> " Okay . Well . He was a good farmer , Jay . " <p> " Thanks . I 'll talk with you . " <p> " You bet . " <p> When he hears the car start , Jay is still spraying . " What do you know about farming , asshole ? " he says out loud . <p> Jay sits on the tractor , watching as car after car pulls into his lane and goes up to the house . People go in , come out , drive away . He does n't stop what he 's doing , just keeps making the rows , putting the seeds in . Up and back , up and back . <p> Jay looks across to the old Flinerman farm . The house is gone , plowed under for an extra half-acre of tillable soil , but the barn is still there , as well as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jay remembers playing there with Erik Flinerman , the only boy within bicycle distance . They played in the hayloft or fished in the small lake that sat at the bottom of the hill that sloped away from the barn . As the sun set , they 'd watch the bats fly out of the old barn , sweep down the hill and over the pond , then swing back up the hill to the tree , where they would disappear among its thick leaves . The bats became a game . They made a high-pitched squeak that could only come from an animal that flew so jaggedly and ate insects . The boys would throw pebbles out over the pond and watch as the bats abruptly dove for them , sometimes nearly skimming the surface of the pond before the pebbles splunked into the water . <p> Over the course of the summer , the boys realized that the point of the game was to knock a bat from the sky . Larger pebbles and stones were thrown into the water . Rhubarb leaves filled with sand and knotted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazing , darting crazily in and out : it seemed that no throw would bring one down . Always it was the same . The bats would come and each boy would time his throw . The bat would fly jerkily , as if knocked to one side . But always , splunk , splunk ! , and the two stones disappeared into the lake . <p> It was the end of the summer , after the first night of the county fair . Jay 's parents were having a late meal at the Flinermans ' , and the two boys had been dismissed from the table . Outside , the sky was cloudless and lightly orange from the set sun . The mosquitoes were thick , and the bats were like hundreds of crows lifting off together from the fall cornfields . As the orange turned to scarlet , and the bats were becoming impossible to see , the boys threw at the same time . The noise came , as it had come so many times that they barely heard it now . Splunk , splunk ... SPLASH . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other and knew . A bat had fallen into the lake . <p> The run to the lake had been funny , both boys laughing and stumbling across the jet-black ground . The sky had gone completely dark , but in the shallows , by the light from the pole lamp , they could just see it , flopping in the water . It appeared broken , its wings at unnatural angles to one another . And it made a new noise , like a kitten mewing . Both boys broke at once for the house . Jay outran the younger Erik by several steps and burst into the kitchen yelling , " We knocked one down ! It 's hurt ! " Erik piled into Jay from behind and Jay 's father looked up from the table , the coffee mug still in his hand . Jay 's father took a small sip from the mug , set it down , and asked , " Is it in the pond , or on the ground ? " <p> " The pond , " both boys said in one voice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Ca n't leave it to suffer . " <p> Jay knew instantly what his father meant , and turned to leave . The younger boy burst into tears and ran to his mother , sobbing . Jay stepped out the back-porch door , hearing it close behind him . He walked to the pickup and took the flashlight from the glove compartment . <p> The noise drew him toward it . Jay laid the light on a rock so the injured bat was lit by the beam . It was flopping less than before . He removed his socks and shoes , being careful not to look at it . Searching the ground , he found a stick and a big rock and waded into the pond , feeling the cold mud squish between his toes . He poked the stick under the bat and flipped it into the shallow water . He stepped to it ; it was in no more than two inches of water , and it more sat on the bottom than floated . Jay looked at it ; it did n't move . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until both it and the rock were submerged . For a moment he waited for something to happen . There were no sounds . No bubbles . No waves . Nothing . <p> Jay waded out of the lake to his father , who stood by the flashlight . <p> " It was good to do , " his father said . <p> " No . It was awful . " <p> " Yes , it was both of those things , good and awful . But it had to be done . " His father scooped Jay up in one arm , resting the boy on his hip . " You ca n't always tell the good thing from the bad thing . But you can always tell the thing that has to be done , " his father said as he carried him to the truck . <p> Now , as Jay finishes the bottom eighty , the sun is beginning to set . He has his corn in . Of course , if it does n't rain , it does n't mean anything . He draws up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , drags it back and leaves it next to the equipment shed . He 'll use it for a few days next week with the beans before putting it in the shed , where it 'll sit until next spring waiting for its next two weeks of usage . <p> He gets back into the cab and pulls the tractor around to the gas tank . He fills it for tomorrow and backs it into its spot in the equipment shed . As he is getting out , he sees another pair of headlights come down the drive . The car pulls up next to the house and his brother , whom he has not seen since his mother 's funeral , gets out . <p> Raising a hand and a " Hello , " Jay walks towards the confinement building . " I 'm about through , go on in and make yourself comfortable , " he shouts . He knows that he should go to Dodge , shake his hand , give him a hug , but the years and distance between them prevent it . <p> " Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I thought our old room . Okay ? " <p> " Sure . " <p> Jay watches as his brother enters his house and lights begin to come on . Then he goes into the grindery and feeds the pigs , checking each pen carefully . This time , there are no dead piglets . When they finish eating , he closes the overhead windows , kills the lights , fires the heaters , and hurries through the darkness towards the house . <p> " Just let me get a shower , " he yells upstairs to his brother . He peels his clothes into a heap and walks downstairs to the open shower in the basement . He turns on the water and steps in . Uses shampoo and shaves . When he is finished cleaning himself , he stands in the shower , feeling the hot water spray against his chest . He raises a hand to waist height and the water flows off him , extending his arm to the floor in a clear arc . Turning away from the shower head , he raises both arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leans back into the spray and takes a mouthful of water , rinses and spits . Gradually the warmth of the shower begins to fade , but he stays in until the water runs almost completely cold . Finally he turns it off . <p> " God , the stars , " Jay hears his brother yell from outside . He dries himself , steps into a pair of jeans and walks up the steps from the basement . The pole light is off . <p> " I 'd give my left nut to have this view at the observatory , " his brother says from the direction of the lawn chairs . " It 's amazing . " <p> " Can I get you a beer or something ? " Jay says , more because he wants to say something than because he means it . <p> " Sure , " Dodge answers , and Jay slips back into the house . He comes back out with two , hands his brother one . <p> " I talked to the lawyer today . He says you own thirty percent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I talked about it a few times . He wanted me to take half . " <p> " Half ? What the hell for ? You did n't want it when they moved . You have n't set foot on it since . Why would you want it now ? " Jay leans forward , resting his elbows on his knees . He can only see the outline of his brother from the starlight . He feels his teeth grit together . <p> " It 's a lot of money . What , fifty-sixty thousand ? " <p> Jay sits still for a moment , then settles back into his seat . " Something like that . " <p> " At least . I suppose you 'd have to mortgage a chunk of the land to pay me . " <p> " I ca n't afford more debt , and I ca n't sell , " Jay says , and takes a sip of his beer . " If you want to farm it , feel free . " <p> " Well , I do n't want that . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jay drinks his beer down about halfway , listens to the night . In the dark , Jay imagines that his father is sitting in the other lawn chair , as he should be this weekend . The two of them , just sitting , enjoying the spring night and the quiet . <p> There is no moon , and the air is so dark that he can just see his hand before his face . The pole light of his nearest neighbor is like a twinkling star . Above him is the Milky Way ; it is as thick as a malt from Dairy Queen . Jay can smell the spring night air : plowed dirt and pig shit . <p> A car passes on the highway that connects his gravel road to town . Though he ca n't see it , he hears that it still has its snow tires on . The tires sound a fading dry note so low that he more feels than hears it . When the note dies , the quiet is defined by what is not present . There are no crickets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pigs squealing . No wind . Jay smiles and takes another sip of his beer . He hears his brother swallow . <p> " Can we just drop the Monty Hall thing ? There 's plenty of time for that , " his brother says , breaking the spell . <p> " What else do we have to talk about ? " <p> Jay sees his brother sit bolt upright , pointing towards him . " God , what is the matter with you ? How about ' How are you , ' ' Had any good dates lately ? ' It 's not like we see each other every day . " Jay hears his brother 's voice go up about an octave . <p> " Okay , how are you ? " <p> " Jesus , must you be so pragmatic all the time ? " <p> Jay expels a hard breath and leans back in his chair , beer in one hand , trying to look at the stars his brother knows so much about . He takes a deep long drink . " There 's a ton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days ? " <p> " I canceled everything until Wednesday . " <p> " Hear anything from Anne ? " Jay asks , opening his eyes and looking at the spread of pinpoints above him . <p> " Only when I 'm late with the child support . " <p> " Sorry , " Jay says , wincing . <p> " Not your fault . Jennifer 's doing fine , though . Going to summer camp this year . " <p> " She 's that old ? " The pinpoints seem to have an order for a moment , and then the order is gone , and the stars look scattered . <p> " Seven in May . " <p> " Get to see her ? " <p> " No . Two weeks in the spring and the fall , a week at Christmas . My schedule just does n't allow for it . " <p> " Anything new happening in the stars ? " Jay says . <p> " I 've got three weeks on the big scope at Cierra Tololo this summer . In Chile . If we get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " What you looking for ? " <p> " It 's a mapping project . Sort of dry . But the country is nice . I 'll get to do some climbing . I do have a good paper coming out in Nature magazine , in August . I 'll send you a reprint . " <p> " Thanks . " <p> " How 's it look around here ? " <p> " Same . If it rains , it 'll be okay . " <p> " If not ? " <p> " Well , last summer was bad . And we did n't get much snow . I need some rain . " <p> " Anybody go ? " <p> " Toleman went ; Consolidated bought him last fall . But his land 's bleached to hell and back . They 'll pump it full of chemicals , get production up for a year or two , then dump it on the market for more than they paid . " <p> " I ca n't get over the stars . I 'd forgotten how nice it is up here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see down to the horizon . " <p> " It 's quiet , all right . " <p> " Did you take care of things ? " <p> " Sunday , two o'clock . Pastor Kramer is giving the eulogy . " <p> Late at night , Jay is asleep in bed when he wakes to the sound of Dodge getting up and going downstairs to the phone . He thinks how strange it is to hear someone moving in the house . He listens to the click of the bedroom phone as Dodge dials below him . " Hello , Anne ? " he hears , in a half-whisper . Jay knows it 's late and he rolls over and looks at the clock : two thirty-five . " I should n't have called , " his brother 's voice says below him , and " At the farm . " Much later , he hears simply , " Dad died . " Then there is no sound for a very long time . <p> Saturday morning , Jay does his usual rounds : checks for rain , feeds the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wait till Wednesday to put the beans in . He walks back into the house ; his brother is up now , making coffee in the kitchen . <p> " Thought I 'd walk up to see Mom . Interested ? " <p> " Let me get a shirt on . " <p> The cemetery is a small one , about two miles up the lane from the farm . There are no more than twenty markers on the side of the small rise with a low stone wall designating the ground from the plantable field around it . In the corner of the cemetery stands a single elm . <p> Dodge sits down on the top of the small stone , zipping the front of his green pile jacket against the wind . Jay sits at the foot of the plot , squinting into the sun . <p> " This was harder for me with Mom . I expect the opposite for you , " Dodge says . <p> " Yes . " The sun feels good on Jay 's back . He can feel it baking through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , you were Dad 's boy . I never was , that 's for sure . " <p> " Then why 'd he give you a third of my farm ? " Jay says , leaning forward . <p> " Because he thought you should have more . " <p> " Like you should have any , " Jay says , standing and turning . <p> The wind blows through the small sanctuary . It smells like dirt and nitrogen fertilizer . Dodge says , " What do you mean by that ? " <p> " It 's my farm . Has been since they moved into town . Not that you 'd have noticed . " <p> " Has n't been such a bad deal for you . You get to do as you see fit . " <p> " Exactly . As I see fit . " Jay turns back to his brother . " Like you know shit about farming . " <p> " I grew up here , too . " <p> " And you left . " The response is too easy , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his brother to the elm tree , buds just beginning to form on the branches . <p> " It 's a lot of money . " <p> " Like you need it . " When he says it , he knows that it is wrong : spiteful and unfair . But he feels it , feels his brother 's comfort . <p> " I 've got a family , a kid to put through school . You do n't , " Dodge says , standing . <p> " Some family , " Jay hears himself say . His voice continues , " Daughter five weeks a year , wife barely speaks to you . " The words are hollow . <p> " Thanks . Just like Dad . You only understand one side of things  --  yours . " Dodge turns away from his brother . <p> " Dad understood both sides . " <p> " He never understood that I could n't stay . " <p> " He understood . " <p> " No , he understood that I wanted to leave , " Dodge says , facing Jay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could n't have stayed . I felt there was something more to life than daily work . " Dodge makes a sweeping movement with his arms . <p> Jay follows his brother 's hand , sees everything . " He said he thought you needed something more solid . " <p> " I do n't follow . " <p> " Mom always said you needed science because it had so many more answers , " Jay says , standing . <p> " Mom was right ; I like to learn . " <p> " He said that he thought you needed something more reasonable . Something that required less luck . " <p> Jay and Dodge sit together in the front room of the local bar . Men and women , people Jay has known all of his life , come by and sit awhile and tell stories about his father . About ice fishing with him on Big Spirit . Or how good an usher he was . Or just about sharing a beer with him when they were younger . They put a hand on Jay 's shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afterthought , shake his hand , avoid eye contact . Debbie comes and sits next to Jay , puts a hand on his leg . <p> " This is my brother Dodge . Dodge , Debbie , " Jay says by way of an introduction . <p> " You 're the astronomer , " she says , reaching across the table . Dodge shakes her hand ; it is thin , but her grip is firm . <p> " Are you two .... ? " Dodge asks , looking more at Debbie than Jay . Debbie looks at Jay . <p> " Him ? God no . Awful , really . " Jay and Dodge both laugh . " I only suck up to him so I do n't have to pay for drinks , " she adds , putting her right arm around Jay . <p> She is rarely serious when they are together . It is precisely this quality that Jay loves about Debbie . It is also this quality that Jay does not love about her . <p> " We 're not anything . We just are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you do n't know where things are with my little brother . He always lets me know , " Dodge says and winks at Jay . <p> " Him ? Completely wishy-washy . Charlie Brownish , if you ask me , " she says , laughing . She kisses Jay on the cheek . Under the table , she folds her left hand into his , separating his fingers with hers . Later , when she gets up to leave , Jay puts his hand in hers , and she sits back down . <p> On the drive to the farmhouse , Jay and Dodge are quiet . They are lit by the headlights from Debbie 's car behind them . As the truck stops in the drive , Dodge quickly gets out and goes into the house without any words . Debbie stops next to Jay 's truck , steps out of the car and walks towards him ; he can smell her perfume . They are close , but there is nothing spoken or defined about their relationship . They are not quite a couple , nor just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she says , and they walk into the house together . <p> In bed , Jay holds her , feels her strong arms with biceps like a young boy 's . Her white skin is smooth , her blond hair long and coarse . She lies with her back to him , and he holds her , kissing her neck and shoulders , feeling her skin . She squeezes against him , turning her head to be kissed . Her breath is sweet . He feels himself stiffen and he moves to between her legs and enters her . The sex is neither simply physical nor love . It is comfort : solace . <p> Much later , her back to him , Jay holds her , feeling how nice it is to have her in the bed with him and listening to her breathing . " Do you love me ? " he asks , thinking she is asleep . <p> " I 'm here , is n't that enough ? " she whispers . <p> " Not now . I want something else . " He runs his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her thigh . <p> " What is it you want ? " she laughs , turning her head and pressing her hips back into him . <p> " I want things to be more permanent . " She turns onto her back , looking at him . " Meaning ? " <p> " I want to know where we are with each other . " <p> " We are intimate . " <p> " I want something more sure . " He runs a hand across her stomach , and she turns towards him . A car passes on the gravel road , and Jay watches as the headlights travel around the room , from the pictures and small box atop the bureau that was his mother 's and father 's and is now his to the fading green closet door . <p> " When I was married , I used to think it would be better for one of us if the other died . I did n't care if it was me or him , I just thought it would be easier for whoever was left . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that again . " <p> Debbie rolls to her side and Jay lies behind her . In a while , he gets up without waking her . He goes downstairs to the kitchen , pours himself a glass of water from the fridge , and in the light reaches for the aspirin . He hears footsteps from upstairs , and for a moment he prays that they are not hers . " Jay ? " comes his brother 's whisper from the living room . <p> " It 's me , " he whispers back . <p> His brother steps into the kitchen , pours a glass of water , sits down across from him at the table . The entryway light splashes them in yellow . " I 've been thinking about the will , " Dodge says . Jay feels his stomach rise with the tone of the sentence . " I do n't want the land . It does n't mean anything to me . It 's your life . This whole way is foreign to me , always was . " <p> " It 's a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " I know . I knew before I got here . If I take part away , though , it 's going to mean that you 'll be in trouble if everything does n't go exactly right every year . I do n't really need it . You do . " " But it 's about a third yours . Dad left it . " <p> " I 've been lying in my bed , " Dodge says , " thinking about how , through that window , I used to watch the fireworks in three towns . How I 've seen the seasons change here so many times I still know exactly what they look like . " Dodge laughs quietly . " I do n't like that bed any more than I used to . But I ca n't imagine it gone . " Jay hears him take a sip of water . " The only thing I ever loved here were the stars , and I take those with me . " He laughs again . " I 'm sure they only look this good when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and walks out the back door . Jay turns off the pole light and follows . There are no stars , no moon , just a black cloud-filled sky and a small square pool of light on the green grass , cast from the porch . <p> " I 'd just sell my part sooner or later . Piss it away and have nothing , " Dodge says . " If I leave it with you , I could bring Jenny out . Maybe get Anne to come . " <p> " What if I sell it all ? Move to town ? " Jay laughs . " Get a real job ? " <p> " Yeah , right . This will never change ; you 'll never do anything exciting . " Dodge steps into the light pool until he 's knee deep in it . He takes a step forward , waist deep . <p> " What 's more exciting than this ? You look through your telescope every night to map stars . " <p> " I hope that 's not the only reason . " Dodge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ankles are gone . <p> " No . You watch because you want to see something , a sign , a marker , some indication that what you do is n't pointless . " " I may never see anything . " <p> " But you would n't watch if you did n't think you were lucky enough to see something , " Jay says . <p> " No . I would n't . " <p> " And nothing beats being lucky . " The yellow washes over Dodge 's face , and Jay sees a few drops of rain fall through the light . <p> In the morning , Jay wakes to the back door closing . He watches from the window as Debbie walks to her car and gets in . She starts the engine and turns on the lights . It is only then that he sees his brother in the doorway to the grindery . Dodge waves to her , and she responds , turning the car down the lane . Jay gets up and pulls on jeans and a sweatshirt . <p> On the back porch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is very cloudy . His brother is in the grindery , and Jay walks to the far end of the confinement and opens the great doors . The grinder kicks on , and he hears the pigs begin to sound . He turns on the lights , shuts off the propane heaters , opens the overheads , and begins to check the crates . When the food begins to come into the troughs , he hears the grindery door close . <p> At the burial , in the small graveyard near the farm , there are thirty or so people gathered when it begins to sprinkle . Many guests , as well as Pastor Kramer , open umbrellas . Dodge opens a great green-and-white-striped one over himself , Debbie , and Jay . Some folks simply stand in the gentle rain . Jay steps out into the rain , looking up . Pastor Kramer calls things to an end , the body is lowered , people file past . The rain comes harder now as Debbie takes Jay 's hand and steps out from beneath the umbrella . In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky as people scramble for cars . Dodge closes the umbrella . In great gray heavy sheets it falls on them as they stand next to the grave , smiling . <p> <p> By Neal Gordon <p>
