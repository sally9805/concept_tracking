Possessive hens can oftentimes make calling in a tom difficult , if not impossible . But there are ways to get between a hen and her gobbler . I should have known it was too good to be true . We were hunting a prime location , a long ridge in the midst of 1,000 acres of seldom-hunted , turkey-infested central Missouri hardwoods . A combination of luck and badgering had gained me a morning in the woods with Brad Harris , a premiere turkey caller who also was on a roll . Each of the last five mornings Harris had called an impressive longbeard into easy gun range for other hunters . From the sound and look of things , I figured the streak would soon enough hit six . The tom had gobbled at one of Harris ' pre-dawn owl hoots . After we set up 120 yards away , the bird had erupted with a double-gobble at Harris ' soft tree yelps . And this did n't sound like just any Ozark longbeard . As we had crept in to set up , Harris and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prime spot on the property . The fact that other gobblers were keeping a safe distance meant that the tom had probably won his share of battles throughout the spring . The sound of the gobble was another clue that we were after a special bird . For 20 minutes I leaned against an oak and listened to the tom roar deep , rattling off gobbles at everything from distant toms to passing crows . When confident the bird was on the ground , Harris had filled the woods with excited cutting . The tom sent back a reply that I felt as well as heard , and I quickly shouldered my gun . I moved only my eyes , staring into the timbered recesses , expecting the neon reds and blues of a gobbler 's head or the shiny black bulk of a strutting tom to appear at any second . I felt my pulse quicken from eardrums to toe tips . Then it happened . A short series of hen yelps sounded in front of us . A minute later the hen , who did n't sound nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My heart rate and breathing instantly fell to normal . Harris broke the silence when he whispered the obvious , " He 's with hens and they 're taking him the other way . " I was indeed disappointed but not surprised or dejected . Outfielders have sun in the eyes , fishermen have cold fronts , and turkey hunters must deal with the disruptive influence of hens . Although we all conjure up pre-season dreams of lonesome toms that strut to our calls , there 's no denying that how the birds respond , and how we must hunt to succeed , largely depends on the hens . In a best-case scenario , opening day will find every hen spending her hours incubating a nest full of eggs , allowing the toms to scour the countryside for a final fling before they retire their libidos for the year . But more often in the world of turkeys , there always will be some hens that run to the side of gobbling toms . Similarly , gobblers also are reluctant to leave a hen at their side for a sweet-talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , if a tom is with hens . Although no single tactic works all of the time , there are some schemes worth trying . Harris and I did n't quit on our " henned-up , " deep-voiced Missouri tom . You should n't surrender either . Though the bird we worked fell silent for hours , some toms are polite enough to continue to gobble as they move away with their hens . If you know the land you can then use the old " head " em off at the pass " tactic . This entails guessing exactly where the birds will pass . In farm country turkeys will often roost on a timbered ridge then parade down to a farm field to feed . Often they take the same trail morning after morning . Find such a turkey trail and you could soon be collecting a gobbler . Like all setups , start off calling sparingly when you 're in front of an approaching flock . Sometimes the sound of aggressive yelping and cutting will cause a selfish hen to change her course and lead the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring the birds right into your lap . As with toms , there are old , dominant hens in the woods that wo n't tolerate a challenger . Get one of those cranky old matriarchs in an ugly mood and your chances of calling in the birds greatly improve . On opening day Dave Billman found himself working a Kansas tom that would n't respond well and refused to budge . Billman smiled when a hen fired back some excited yelps in response to his box call . The verbal duel continued for several minutes . He excitedly mimicked the hen 's call note for note . And although most times you would need to call nearly nonstop to get a hen to come running , such was n't the case for Billman . Confident the hen was on her way , Billman laid his call aside and waited . It was n't long before a clucking hen came into view , followed by another hen and , of course , the longbeard that eventually fell to Billman 's shot . Another method taps into a tom 's fighting spirit : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind . Experienced hunters have long used coarse gobbler yelps , purring and cutting to lure dominant birds far away from hens . It 's also not uncommon to get a little rivalry going between the toms in a flock . Dan Torrence and I found ourselves in the typical good news/bad news situation shortly after we entered some of Torrence 's hunting grounds near his home in Winfield , Kansas . A bird had gobbled at my first round of cutting , but minutes later Torrence peeked into a nearby wheat field and reported we were working a flock of two longbeards , two jakes and an assortment of hens . It was one of the true certainties of gobbler hunting  --  the turkeys we wanted were moving in the other direction . A co-owner of Walnut Valley Guided Hunts , Torrence led us on a serpentine course back and forth across a meandering stream and beneath small ridges to get closer to the flock . We both knew the closer we got the better our chances would be of separating a tom from the bunch . We delightedly set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flock 80 yards away . Even though the birds were still moving in another direction , we figured we 'd be in business if we could get the jakes fired up and coming . I started calling softly , using just a few yelps and clucks . No response . After 10 minutes with absolutely no luck I dug out my loudest , raspiest mouth call and went to work with a full 10 seconds of aggressive cutting . Bingo ! Though I did n't hear them , Torrence whispered that the birds had gobbled in the middle of my calls . For several long minutes the unmoving quartet double and triple-gobbled . Finally they broke free of the hens and started our way . From the sound of things , the two jakes were headed straight in with one of the longbeards right behind them . The young toms continued at a steady pace , but they appeared to be jogging compared with the old gobbler that was trying an end-around and sprinting in from my right . I dropped the nice longbeard when he stopped just 11 yards away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help lure another bird to your gun . Next to the excited calls of a real hen , nothing draws toms faster than a gobblefest that 's being sung by other birds . Last May , Brad Harris , Randy Marcum and I rode horses deep into South Dakota 's Black Hills . The first morning out found us working a mixed flock of Merriam 's toms and hens that refused to come within range . The lack of understory and steep sides of the pine-covered ridge kept us from swinging ahead of the moving flock . Rather than take a chance on spooking the whole bunch , we waited on a jagged spur ridge while Harris kept the toms gobbling with a combination of crow and pileated woodpecker calls . Our plan of moving closer when the birds dropped into the next drainage was put on hold when a distant tom started answering both Harris ' calls and the gobbles of the flock . Realizing that the tom was hot and coming fast , I bailed over the edge of the little ridge and set up as best I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yards out Harris poured out excited cutting and yelps . The gobbler forgot all about the other toms and hens and came right down the ridge toward us . The shot that dropped the longbeard was anticlimactic compared with the sight of the gorgeous Merriam 's tom strutting his way around boulders and huge pines in the soft , early morning light . But more than any one tactic , simple persistence is your best strategy when hens are making it tough . If you 're blessed with a lot of free time and a long season , simply wait a week or two and then try the birds again . Generally speaking , hens are on the nest later in the season . Also , do n't head for home if the birds shut up and seemingly vanish after flydown time . Instead , cover some ground looking for a cooperative bird . You might well leave a tom or two with hens and find a hot bird just over the next hill . And never make the mistake of giving up too early on a bird . I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out if it gobbles at their calls just once . " Sooner or later , " they say , " he 'll come back looking for you . " Following our lost battle with the hard-gobbling Missouri bird at sunrise , Harris and I covered some of the property trying to locate another tom . When that failed Harris simply sat down , leaned against a tree and started to relax . " I do n't see any use in running around spooking turkeys , " he said . " With basically no two-year-olds toms that are long on beard and hormones but short on caution and hens the birds we 've heard are older birds that are with hens . They are n't going to say a word for a while . " Harris went to on to explain that throughout the morning the hens would feed up and eventually go off to nest for the afternoon . Late in the morning , he predicted , those toms that had dated all morning would probably be alone . That , he explained , was why 80 percent of the toms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. , the end of legal shooting time in Missouri . True to Harris ' word , we started hunting again with two hours of shooting time left . First we worked the edges of the farm , trying to get a tom to gobble at Harris ' cutting on a box call . At 12:30 , we quietly eased into the area where we 'd been beaten at daybreak . Harris popped his Lohman box call a few times and thought he heard a gobble to our right . We eased to just below that ridge and he called again . The responding gobble was close enough that we bounced off each other like Laurel and Hardy in our hurry to set up . I plopped myself against a small oak , pulled a headnet over my face and rested the gun 's stock on my knee . Harris took cover behind me and sent another series of yelps and soft cutting from the box call . The bird never gobbled again , but a minute later we could hear the unmistakable sound of turkey toes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the tom was careful to keep the break in the ridge between himself and the location of the calls . I first saw him 40 yards to my left , raising just his red and blue head high enough to check out the flat . The bird was back down in seconds , and I could hear him cautiously moving closer and closer . After what seemed like an hour , but was probably only a minute , I saw the head and neck of the turkey come into view in front of me . As the gobbler passed behind a tree I aimed my gun and squeezed the trigger when he stepped back into view . The tom was indeed an old patriarch . As tall a turkey as we 'd ever seen , years of running the ridges and fighting had kept his scar-pocked body weight down to 21 3/4 pounds . Battered and broken , his spurs were only a token of what they 'd once been but still measured 1 1/4 inches . His beard , however , had fared well through the years . Three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length . We headed toward a crossroads gas station and a well-deserved soft drink . " There 's nothing really fancy about getting a tom when hens are a problem , " said Harris as he took a swig of soda . " All you can do is grab your calls , stay in the woods and keep trying . Hunters who work hard enough will probably be successful . " <p>
