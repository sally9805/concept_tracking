<p> I bought some stamps at the Georgetown Post Office the other day , and visited Anderson House , the gorgeous mansion-museum near Dupont Circle . Different in style , period and purpose , the two buildings have little in common except this : Both are registered historic landmarks and both have been splendidly restored in recent months . <p> These buildings , in other words , illustrate a couple of facts of life in the capital city . One is that Washington is extremely fortunate in the quality and quantity of its historic buildings . They are all around us , in all sections of the city , and they contribute to our lives in important ways  --  giving vitality and beauty to our streets , bringing messages from the past to bear on our present , and adding to the city 's rich , multilayered identity . <p> Furthermore , each restoration in its own way demonstrates the tremendous preservation skills of Washington 's architects . In the two decades following passage of the city 's historic preservation law in 1978 , local architects have explored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sophistication that can be matched by few , if any , American cities . <p> In this long-term effort architects and property owners have enjoyed the support  --  and sometimes the prodding  --  of knowledgeable professionals in the Historic Preservation Division , a tiny office squirreled away in the city 's Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs . The little preservation division , with a staff of seven , does weighty work : It is charged with administering the preservation law , providing liaison with federal preservation programs and providing staff support for the appointed Historic Preservation Review Board , among other responsibilities . <p> And yet , inside the city government a proposal to eliminate the division has been discussed as part of the overall effort to trim the city 's budget . The proposal , emanating from the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs itself , may or may not see the light of day in actual budget hearings . But the very fact that it exists is alarming , for it is a ludicrous and irresponsible idea . <p> The preservation division is one of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of less than $ 600,000 a year  --  more than half of which is picked up by federal grants  --  this highly competent staff performs essential government services efficiently and well . <p> And that is the key : These services really are essential . Before the law was passed , landmark buildings and even entire districts were pushed aside as if they were worthless junk . Today , thanks in no small measure to the folks of the preservation division , such treasures stand a much better chance of getting the kind of attention they deserve . ( Developers often chafe at the preservation regulations but , as time has proved , escape clauses in the 1978 law are more than sufficient for projects of outstanding merit . ) <p> The Georgetown Post Office and Anderson House are excellent examples of preservation at work . In Georgetown , the Washington architecture firm Sorg and Associates , which previously had restored the interior of the Lincoln Theatre on U Street to its former glory , managed to bring a first-rate mid-19th-century building back to something close to its original luster , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and plumbing systems . <p> Located on 31st Street NW just north of M Street , the sober , gray-granite building has been a distinguishing feature of the Georgetown scene for 140 years . It was designed by Ammi Burnham Young as a prototype federal facility ; originally , it also served as a custom house for the busy port down the hill . Modeled after Italian Renaissance palaces , the building 's lines are severe and its proportions pleasing ; it stands back from the street a bit as if dignity demanded the extra space . <p> The building looks much better today than it did just a year ago , thanks to cleaning , a bit of repointing of the masonry joints , a new iron fence and , above all , the removal of a 70-year-old lean-to addition on the north side . A nice-looking wheelchair ramp was fitted unobtrusively into the area where the wood-frame addition used to stand . <p> But the most important part of the $ 2.1 million job took place inside , where the ground-floor postal space had been robbed of its considerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Today , much of its high-ceilinged openness has returned , along with such engaging details as the unusual , re-gilded capitals atop the cast-iron structural columns . <p> In short , the big room has become a pleasure to visit rather than just a chore . To make it so was not simple or automatic . Because old buildings are multilayered puzzles , assiduous research was involved . Consultation and persuasion played big roles . The U.S. Postal Service 's need for an efficient retail operation had to be met in a setting where the standard postal redesign would have proved intrusive . There was give and take all along the line . <p> Not coincidentally , the happy ending is due in part to the professionalism and authority of the city 's historic preservation staff . David Bell , project architect for Sorg and Associates , recalls that their persistence made a real difference : " They did not dictate , " Bell says , " but they were constantly urging everybody to do the right thing . " <p> At Anderson House , the extraordinary 50-room mansion at 2118 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff were simply helpful rather than crucial . Architect Belinda Reeder of Archetype , a Washington firm that has guided the restoration of several of the city 's best historic houses , says staff members were able to point her in the right direction during the research phase . " Often , they know more about a building than I do , " Reeder says , " and they know where every little bit of information is . " <p> The mansion  --  palace is perhaps a better word  --  now does triple duty as headquarters of the Society of the Cincinnati ( an organization of male descendants of Continental officers in the Revolutionary War ) ; as a house museum redolent of Washington 's high-society era early in the 20th century ( diplomat Larz Anderson and author-wife Isabel , the original owners , were even richer and higher than most ) ; and as a rare book and general reference library for scholars of the Revolutionary War period . <p> Designed by Little and Browne of Boston and completed in 1905 , it is a formidable showplace  --  you half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corinthian-columned limestone canopy . The familiar quandary facing the restoration architects was this : Although change to the building was needed , it was potentially harmful . When you upgrade an old treasure , the results can be ruinous because an entirely new set of health and safety regulations apply  --  you need more stairs , doors , fire protection , handicap access , and so on . <p> The truly amazing thing about this $ 6.1 million renovation , then , is that all the public areas , outside and inside , look almost exactly as they did before . And yet behind the old walls this is a thoroughly modern building , with updated infrastructure and lots more space for museum and library functions . <p> In effect , the architects were able to play a sophisticated game of sleight of hand , taking advantage of everything the building gave them  --  a surprising structural system whose fire resistance exceeded the tough demands of contemporary codes , and lots of hidden passageways and neglected storerooms that could be adapted to meet new needs . The new spaces  --  an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the basement , and museum support facilities on the formerly underused fourth floor  --  are crisply designed in a contemporary idiom . <p> The restorations of Anderson House and the Georgetown Post Office are but two recent examples of why , in Washington , we should be thankful . Few cities have so many historic buildings and districts of such outstanding quality , so many architects of such sensitivity and skill , and a regulatory system that so consistently encourages the best . <p> This talk of dismantling a key element in our preservation process  --  the city 's Historic Preservation Division  --  is sheer idiocy . What should be happening is the reverse . Washington 's overseers , both elected and unelected , should be focusing on ways to better take advantage of our historic resources , to make them an integral part of a cohesive , exciting , productive vision for the city as a whole .
