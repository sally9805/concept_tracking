<p> The words tumble from the phone , bumping into each other in their hurry to be heard : " Story , national importance , five myths , Selena . " <p> It was the voice of Hank Caltabiano . He said he was upset by five lies that have haunted Tejano star Selena 's memory since she was killed March 31 , police say , by an employee who also was a former president of the singer 's fan club . <p> " I was home in my house that day , " Caltabiano said . " I got a call from a friend of mine , a disc jockey in Greeley , Ken Nuanez , who knows her personally . It was just like ( President ) Kennedy . I 'll never forget it . <p> " My first thing was , ' Ken that 's not a nice thing to joke about . ' ' It is true , Hank , ' he said , " Caltabiano remembered . <p> Now is the time to clear these matters up , he said , because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The volume of news coverage from the trial means a lot of the untruths will be repeated . <p> Selena Quintanilla Perez was 23 when she was shot at a Day 's Inn hotel in her hometown of Corpus Christi , Texas . By that age she had become a one-name-only star and carried the label of Queen of Tejano music . <p> Tejano music , according to Billboard , is " basically Mexican polkas and cumbias , mixed with elements of rock , pop and country . " Tejano is Texas-based , but Selena 's star shone around the United States and Mexico . At the time of her death , Selena 's audience was by far a Mexican and Mexican-America one . She was the first Tejano singer to become a star in Mexico . <p> She had millions of fans , but ironically , most Anglos first learned of Selena because of her death . <p> That 's one reason Caltabiano insisted the five myths needed to be debunked . <p> Caltabiano arrived for an interview with a 13-by-19-inch Ploy envelope filled to bursting with news releases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories , and a bilingual biography of Selena . All were marked in red . Some of the underlined sentences carried the myths . Others showed how the mistakes came to be and offered proof of their error . <p> He compiled the material both on his own time and as public relations director of Min- <p> utemen Response Security , 4800 Wadsworth Blvd . He also penned an article on his claims for Del Sol , a bilingual Hispanic weekly published in the metro area . <p> Caltabiano 's evidence also contained an audio tape that captured the voice of a Denver Spanish-speaking newscaster repeating the rumor that the wife of the King of Tejano , Emilio Navaira , killed Selena because the king and the queen were having an affair . <p> Caltabiano also packed in seven video tapes to dispel myths that Selena was provocative on stage , could n't speak Spanish , and was the " Mexican Madonna . " The final myth that she threw panties from the stage is dispelled by a correction to a Texas Monthly magazine article . <p> Caltabiano is of medium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for three much larger people . His Brooklyn childhood occasionally surfaces in his speech even though he left there 28 years ago . <p> He talks fast , but really kicks into high gear when he discusses the wrongs he sees having been done to Selena after her death . He often uses " left " and " gone " as euphemisms for " died " and " dead . " <p> " To this day , it is really strange , but it is hard to talk about her in the past . It is really hard . " <p> He first saw Selena five years ago and was struck by her talent , beauty and wholesomeness . <p> Now she is dead , and he wants to make sure that people know the truth about her , especially those who first heard of her after her death . <p> The myth that she was killed by an enraged wife disappeared as soon as police arrested the suspect after a day-long standoff . Myth No. 2 , however , still lives . It started in a September 1994 Texas Monthly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Selena tossed " a pair of panties into the crowd . " <p> " I got the Texas Monthly article when it came out , " said Caltabiano . " I said , ' Selena ? No , it ca n't be . ' They corrected it in the next issue . " <p> He pulled from his evidence file a copy of the correction and an accompanying apology , underlined in red . <p> But that was n't the end of it . <p> The quickie post-murder biography " Selena ! " ( Pocket Books $ 5.99 ) praised Patoski 's " insightful profile . " Author Clint Richmond also quoted the erroneous panty tossing scene . <p> Richmond set up the passage by quoting another portion of the Patoski article that noted that when Selena arrived for the performance , he saw " a natural beauty as beatific as the original Madonna 's . " But on stage " it 's the other Madonna she evokes , sashaying in front of the band in ( sic ) a halter top and tight pants , getting the males in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the crowd " <p> " It became a best seller on The New York Times list , " Caltabiano said , pointing to a clipping of The New York Times best-seller list . " That lie was in a best seller , and the lie was repeated all over the country . " <p> It should have been laid to rest by the correction printed in the October 1994 Texas Monthly . But it did n't , so Caltabiano felt he had to land the knockout punch . " I would never say she is n't sexy . She is sexy , but she was never vulgar . " <p> That ties directly into reports that Selena was provocative on stage , a " Tex-Mex or Latin Madonna . " <p> From his evidence pile , Caltabiano plucked newspaper stories written within days of her death . A Detroit News reporter wrote she had been compared to Madonna " because of her provocative , midriff-baring outfits . " An Associated Press article said part of Selena 's appeal was the skimpy black outfits she wore onstage and that " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tex-Mex Madonna tag , as did the AP . <p> Selena was asked about the comparison in an interview with Latin Style magazine . She replied : " I find it very flattering . I think when people say that , they mean it as far as success goes . " <p> Selena said in the same interview she wanted an acting career but would never take a part that would require her to curse . " I do n't really cuss in my personal life I have a lot of fans who are kids , and I would n't want to disillusion them , especially their parents . " <p> Then Caltabiano pointed out an AP story about the MTV music awards show . " Madonna used the f-word , " it said . That short quote would be enough proof for most people , but Caltabiano had more . <p> He showed several snippets of videotapes of Selena onstage at Tejano Music Awards shows from 1990 to 1995 . " I want you to see how she is dressed . ( She wore a dark-blue evening gown . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he asked . <p> At the 1994 award show , she wore black leather . <p> " She has got on leather pants . So what ? That one from Utah would do that . " <p> You mean Osmond ? <p> " That 's it , Marie and Donnie . " <p> He critiqued another performance : " She is going to go into a little dance , and I want you to see how pure she is . See that beautiful smile ? She is just golden . Look ! Look ! Makes you want to watch more , does n't it ? " <p> Selena 's stage persona looked nothing like Madonna 's . Her " provocative , midriff-baring outfits " were not all that scanty . Mostly , they feature skin-tight pants and rhinestone-studded halter tops . Many young women in Denver wear similar clothes in the summer , so she was pretty tame for stage dress . <p> One can see far more blatantly sexy acts on any country music award show . And that includes some male singers . <p> So , we now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Did she or did n't she speak Espanol ? Caltabiano first submitted an Aug. 4 story written by nationally syndicated columnist Roger E. Hernandez . He wrote , " Selena herself could barely speak ( Spanish ) at all . " <p> Next Caltabiano turned to a July 8 television grid where he had circled in red Channel 9 's 7 p.m. offering : " Latin Nights : An All-star Celebration . " <p> " NYPD Blue 's " Jimmy Smits hosted the show . " The fact is that ( Selena ) spoke little Spanish , " Smits said during the show . <p> " The nerve of him saying she does n't speak Spanish . She speaks it better than her parents . She made it a point to learn it , " Caltabiano said . <p> He made his point with a tape that showed Selena being interviewed in Spanish on " Cristina , " a Miami-based television talk show . Cristina is considered the Spanish Oprah . <p> So , the final myth disappeared as Selena easily replied in Spanish to Cristina 's questions . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She occasionally has to ask in English how to say something , " Caltabiano said . " But that 's because it is not her first language . " <p> She learned Spanish to honor her fans . Many of them are native Spanish speakers . Spanish is the first language of a good number of her millions of fans , he said . <p> While Caltabiano comes across as a super fan , he said he had only two Selena cassette tapes and one CD at the time of her death . She was , he said , a very special person . <p> " The guys noticed her first and talked about her all day and the wives got mad . Then they would see her and fall in love with her , too . It is a very strange thing , " he said . <p> " This is not
