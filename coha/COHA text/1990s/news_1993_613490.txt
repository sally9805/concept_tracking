<p> You do n't need to buy a ticket to lose on the lottery . Ask C.B. " Jack " Rogers Jr. , chairman and chief executive officer of Equifax Inc . <p> The Atlanta-based company , best known for tracking the bill-paying habits of virtually all the adults in the United States , is embroiled in a legal battle with the California State Lottery . A promising new source of revenue is in limbo and a $ 40-million-to-$ 50-million extraordinary charge is possible this quarter or next because of the dispute . <p> Equifax , convinced it had the best technology available , and contending with a weak economy that was affecting its other businesses , bid on and won a contract to provide California with an instant lottery ticket system . The five-year , $ 120 million contract was awarded in 1992 , terminated in 1993 , and Equifax and California are now suing each other . <p> " The lesson to be learned from my point of view is you can be technologically superior but politically inept , " said Mr. Rogers in an interview @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Equifax , but it is one of two issues that , until last week , practically becalmed the company 's stock in 1993 . The other anchor has been uncertainty over what changes Congress might make in the Fair Credit Reporting Act . <p> A revision of the 23-year-old consumer protection law is being shaped in Congress now . Equifax adopted many of the proposals in a similar revision that was withdrawn without a vote in the last Congress . <p> " I 'd rather see a bill pass than no bill at all , " said Mr. Rogers . " Right now we 're in never-never land . I think we 'd all rather put the ground rules down . You might not like them all , but put them down and then we 'll address them . " <p> One proposal made before that Equifax does n't like would require that consumers be given a free copy of their credit report once a year . Consumers who are denied credit , insurance or a job because of something in a credit report are entitled by current law to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under that can get one for $ 8 , " noted Mr. Rogers . " And that is a substantially reduced price from before . . . we do n't believe anybody should compel us to give away our products for nothing . " <p> Analysts see climb to $ 25-$ 27 <p> Mr. Rogers does not anticipate that the outcome of either issue will do much to hurt the stock price . " But , " he said , " I ca n't talk these things away . The investing public has the right to have a critical eye until they see what happens . " <p> What a number of Wall Street analysts see happening is the stock going up further . Susan L. Decker , of Donaldson , Lufkin &; Jenrette , and Kevin R. Gruneich , at First Boston , think the stock could hit $ 25 by year 's end . It closed Friday at $ 22.50 after setting an all-time high of $ 22.62 1/2 earlier in the week . Stephen J. Shook of Interstate/Johnson Lane is predicting $ 27 . <p> These predictions come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Integrity Systems Inc. , the Equifax unit that was awarded the lottery contract . <p> Equifax told analysts the company might take a charge of 38-39 cents a share if there was no progress on a settlement with the California State Lottery . That would be a conservative accounting move , reversible if a settlement were reached later . <p> Richard F. Wacht , vice president of investor relations at Equifax , said neither a writedown , if it occurred , nor a reversal of the charge would be of any consequence , although the stock price might move on the news . <p> " It 's not a cash hit , " he said . " It does n't upset the fundamentals of Equifax 's operations . " <p> Nor does the possibility appear to have dampened support among brokers . Five of nine analysts whose reports are tracked by the First Call research firm currently have a strong buy recommendation on Equifax . One analyst has a weak buy rating . Three others rate it a hold . <p> Louis Giglio of Bear , Stearns , has a hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of late favors faster-growing companies like Atlanta-based First Financial Management , as well as First Data and Sterling Software . <p> Those who favor Equifax cite a lot of reasons to buy the stock : <p> Lack of attention leaves room for the price to rise . Equifax is not a high-profile company and sometimes falls through the cracks on Wall Street , noted Mr. Gruneich . <p> A healthy balance sheet . <p> Strong market position . <p> A rebound in revenue growth . <p> Entry into the health-care cost containment field with last year 's purchase of Health Economics Corp . Equifax has " some other potential health-care acquisitions in the wings , " said Mr. Rogers . <p> Early success with operations overseas . <p> The possibility that Equifax has found a solution to problems in the insurance information segment , long a sore point with analysts . The segment accounted for 35 percent of Equifax 's revenue in 1992 but only 11 percent of operating income , so a turnaround could add significantly to earnings . <p> " I think we 've hit the bottom and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be sure , " offered Mr. Rogers . But he added that " if this team ca n't fix it , we 've got to take other steps . " Financial and organization changes that reduced costs and the bureaucracy at Equifax . The ranks of vice presidents were reduced by two- thirds , for example . The total work force also has been reduced about 20 percent since 1990 . <p> Mr. Rogers is careful not to take credit or hand out criticism , but insiders and outsiders alike think Equifax has become a much more nimble company during his watch . <p> A change in culture <p> " Certainly the corporate metabolism has been raised , " he said . " The energy level has been raised . Cars do n't fly out of the parking lot at 4 o'clock . But I do not want that to reflect on my predecessors . It was a day and a time in a different world . " <p> " Equifax was a fine company for its day , in the ' 50s , and the ' 60s . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ' 90s , " said Donald F. Walsh , a senior vice president who 's been at the company for four decades . Mr. Rogers , he said , made needed changes , " as gently as possible , but with persistence . " <p> Mr. Rogers is but 14 months away from turning 65 , the traditional age at which Equifax CEOs give up that title but remain chairman . If that happens , 56-year-old Daniel W. McGlaughlin , the current president , presumably would become CEO . <p> Mr. Rogers , who has been an Equifax director since 1978 and an officer since 1987 , would say only that " I plan to stay here . . . as long as the board wants me to stay .
