<p> Fred Saylor made it through 99.8 percent of this century with little more to complain about than a case of the shingles and a sore back . <p> He grew up miles by horseback from the nearest doctor , plied Trail Ridge Road driving a rickety tourist bus and spent World War II on an aircraft carrier getting dive-bombed by Japanese planes . But the biggest threat in his slow march to the millennium came while he rested in his easy chair just a few months short of the mark . <p> A heart attack the day before Halloween sent Saylor to the hospital for two weeks , after he 'd largely avoided the place for 99 years . He made it back to his apartment and a little extra nursing care by mid-November ; he has since recovered the ornery voice of a man reluctant to admit how eager he is to see 100 . <p> ' You scared us , Fred , ' his friends say when they come by to greet him . <p> ' I scared myself , ' he replies . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major health complaints is not as surprising as it sounds , said a national expert on centenarians . Dr. Thomas Perls , a Harvard Medical School professor conducting a study on New England 's very old , likes to put it this way : ' The older you get , the healthier you 've been . ' <p> Perls has found a remarkable number of his patients roaring past 100 in fine form , proof of his developing theory that the same robust genes that can take a body past the century mark help ensure a sound body for most of the journey . <p> ' Many are living a vast majority of their lives in incredibly good health , ' Perls said . ' Only has the last 5 percent of their lives been in poor health . ' <p> Perls ' definitive studies may change the ' hope I die before I get old ' mentality among many baby boomers , who are convinced that real life ends at about 75 . People who take good care of themselves by eating right and avoiding the major vices for three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of decent living before things really start to go wrong , Perls emphasized . <p> And then there 's Fred , taking a personal wrecking ball to a major portion of Perls ' theory . Saylor smoked like a chimney nearly all his adult life , and probably would have lit up in the hospital if there had n't been so many oxygen tanks lying inconveniently close to his bed . <p> ' He 's the very first one I 've heard of that has smoked like that , ' Perls said . ' It 's really too bad . I think he got away with it up until now . He must have absolutely amazing genes . ' <p> Saylor 's Denver doctor , John Smits of Kaiser Permanente , said Fred has made it deeper into life than any of his other elderly patients without too much medical advice . Even after the heart attack , Smits does n't know how much to push the nagging about cigarettes . <p> ' You hate to take away one of the few things they really enjoy doing , ' Smits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the few truly pleasurable things in their life . ' <p> Saylor admitted that the smoking may have taken some toll by now , but he has n't made it this far without the ability to put things in a larger context . ' My hobby is going to the funerals of people who do n't smoke and criticized me for smoking , ' he said . <p> Before the heart attack , Smits said Saylor had been cruising toward a July 2000 party for his 100th birthday . He had battled some back pain , as the vertebrae thin out with age , weaken and succumb to stress fractures . Saylor had also battled some stomach problems , as well as a tendency to depression that Smits has come to expect from many very old patients as their still-healthy minds begin to feel imprisoned in a failing body . <p> All the conditions were improved with medication , and ' this fall he was in as good a shape as I 've seen him , ' Smits said . When someone has reached the crest of 100 as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to three : stroke , heart disease and Alzheimer 's . On the third count , Saylor 's mind has not faltered . <p> ' What 's striking is that he 's got such a great memory , ' Smits said . Saylor not only recalls the ships he sailed on in World War II , but more practical , and at least recently , comforting details of how his Texaco stock did yesterday . <p> Of the people that reach 100 , said Harvard 's Perls , about 30 percent retain strong bodies and sharp minds . <p> ' They are the ones who go on to 107 and 108 , ' he said . ' The brain is the main determinant . ' Of the other 70 percent who are not functioning as well by 100 , about half will be lost in the next year . <p> About one in 10,000 of the general population is 100 or older . That rate will stay about the same when the baby boom generation approaches 100 , but because of the huge bubble of boomers , the raw number will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times what we have now . <p> As the boomers age , we can expect to hear more than we want to know about their bodies ' stubborn resistance to their commands . Saylor does n't complain , but will tell you if you ask . He has avoided arthritis , but the messages to his extremities seem to take longer and longer to deliver . ' You button your shirt , and one tail ends up longer . You do it over again , and the other side ends up longer , ' he said . <p> The heart attack has further lowered his expectations . In the kind of heart attack Fred had , the heart muscle ca n't pump blood to the right places , and it begins to pool in the lungs . Fred 's lasted long enough that the muscle itself suffered some irreparable damage , and though it is pumping blood again , it is weaker . Fred went home from the hospital to a regimen with visiting nurses each morning , when before all he needed was a little help preparing his meals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ push to the millennium . Family love and attention are the main factors in helping the very old recover from a severe illness , doctors said . <p> Fred 's daughter , Pat Tobey , has been managing his recovery , and grandchildren like Robin Tobey come by to straighten his magazines , find his channel changer and help him yell at the stuffed dog he keeps at his feet . <p> The wise men and women of Windsor Gardens check on him as well , and Frenchy is among the regulars from Saylor 's Wednesday night poker game who is glad to deliver heckling to Fred in person if he ca n't make it over to the poker room . <p> Saylor would like to get back onto his electric cart , which he resorted to when the Tobey women told him he could n't use his car anymore . ' I 'm still a better driver than either one of them , ' he said on the day before Thanksgiving . <p> The oldest documented human died at age 122 in 1997 , a one-in-5 or -6 billion chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fondly recalls the man . The oldest person living right now is a woman of 119 in Allentown , Pa . She is not doing so well now , Perls said , ' but my guess is at 116 she was in very good shape . ' <p> Perhaps there is a 19-year-old living right now who plans on making it to the year 2100 . There is a Web site , of course , that can calculate the chances for this , given a few bits of information : www.livingto100.com . At his current rate , Perls would hit 92 , a number he said he could easily bump upward if he ate less and wore down his spare tire . <p> There are two countries where doctors have found extraordinary numbers of people making the century mark . In Nova Scotia and in Sardinia , an island off the coast of Italy , twice as many people live to 100 as in America . Because their climates and lifestyles are so different , researchers are still seeking an explanation . <p> New Year 's Eve will be just another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good health in the coming year , as it likely will be for Fred Saylor . These days , Fred ca n't quite stay up through ' Monday Night Football . ' But even when the breaths come more shallow and a big afternoon is moving from the bed to the easy chair , waking up on New Year 's Day with a another year and a 100th birthday to look forward to in the same calendar that would be something . <p> Something that Fred Saylor now wants to do more than ever . <p> The Post is following Fred Saylor 's journey toward his 100th birthday in the next millennium .
