When Pakistan 's President , Ghulam Ishaq Khan , dismissed the government of Benazir Bhutto on charges of corruption and incompetence two weeks ago , he promised new elections on Oct. 24 . Most Pakistanis received that assurance with skepticism : delaying elections in the wake of a coup or sudden change in government has become an established national tradition . Those reservations hardened last week when caretaker Prime Minister Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi , a Bhutto enemy , pushed forward a process of " accountability , " which principally involves investigating crimes committed by the old regime . " The government had become stinkingly corrupt , " Jatoi told TIME last week . <P> As Jatoi 's government hunts for evidence of corruption , its central target is Asif Zardari , Bhutto 's husband , who has been charged with using his wife 's political position to further his business deals . Said Jatoi : " A 10% commission had to be paid to get permission for setting up any project . Commissions had to be paid to get bank loans . . . Zardari is a party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " As part of the investigation , the police arrested four of Zardari 's friends , including Iqbal Memon , a partner in his construction business . Three workers of Bhutto 's Pakistan People 's Party were picked up as well . Says a former minister in Bhutto 's Cabinet : " The game plan seems to be to arrest people close to Asif so that the skeletons can be forced out of the closet . " <P> Jatoi is particularly biting in his personal attacks on Bhutto . Says he : " As Prime Minister , Bhutto was arrogant , corrupt and inefficient . She did n't fulfill the expectations of the people . . . and she has damaged the democratic process so badly that it will take some time to heal the wounds . " <P> Though most Pakistanis support the investigations , the new government has not escaped controversy . Its decision last week to send troops to Saudi Arabia to support the international action against Iraq met with a wary popular response . <P> To temper criticism and rally some nationalistic fervor , the army announced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it crushed an Indian ; attempt to capture an outpost in the Kel sector of Azad Kashmir , a nominally independent slice of Kashmir that is actually under Islamabad 's control . While the Indians denied the attack , the Pakistani army portrayed it as a significant escalation in Indo-Pakistani tensions , accusing the Indians of using heavy artillery on the border for the first time . Jatoi , though , described the border skirmish as " not that serious . " <P> Like any other politician preparing for an upcoming election , Jatoi is concentrating his energies on bread-and-butter issues . At its first meeting , his 12-member caretaker Cabinet voted to lower prices of such staples as wheat and onions . The Cabinet also disbanded the controversial People 's Program , a $230 million welfare project that Bhutto allegedly used to promote her party 's interests . The big question that remains , however , is whether Jatoi will keep his appointment at the ballot box .
