Monopolistic pricing <p> In a world where parents go into debt to finance their children 's higher education and where alumni , corporations , and Congress are besieged with calls for more donations to colleges and universities , the time is long overdue to ask why college is so costly . Nobel-prize-winning economist Milton Friedman has estimated that colleges could operate at a profit , charging about half of what most Ivy League institutions charge . Why then does college cost so much ? What is going on ? <p> The average tuition at American colleges and universities rose every year throughout the decade of the 1980s , at a rate much higher than the general rate of inflation in the economy . Private colleges led the way , charging not only the highest tuitions but also taking a growing percentage of family income . In academic year 197677 , the average tuition at private four-year colleges was less than 17% of median family income but , by academic year 1987-88 , their tuition was more than 22% of median family income . By academic year 1990-91 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per year or more . By no means were these all distinguished institutions . <p> Mitigating the full impact of these charges were : ( 1 ) the widespread availability of financial aid ; ( 2 ) the fact that most private colleges charged less than $8,000 ; and ( 3 ) the fact that most students attended public institutions . Nevertheless , the sums which had to be paid represented serious sacrifices for many families , especially since travel costs , clothing , increasingly expensive textbooks , and other incidental expenses had to be paid for , in addition to charges for tuition , room , and board . Dartmouth is not unique in listing in its admissions and financial-aid bulletin the availability of home-equity loans which permit parents " to tap up to 80% of the equity in their homes as an educational resource . " <p> College and university officials have often responded to complaints about rapidly rising tuition with claims that rising costs have made these increases necessary . Like so much that is said by educational institutions , this claim sounds plausible at first , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not stand up under scrutiny . Even if not a single price except tuition had changed anywhere in the entire economy , " costs " would still have risen , as costs are defined in academic discussion . <p> Whatever colleges and universities choose to spend their money on is called a cost . If they hire more administrators , or build more buildings to house them , or send the college president on more junkets , these are all additional costs . If they hire more secretaries for the administrators , these are all costs . Doing more research , raising salaries , inviting more high-priced speakers to campus , and many other things also increase costs . What colleges and universities seek to insinuate  --  misleadingly-by saying that costs have gone up is that the cost of what they have always done is rising , necessitating an increase in tuition . But colleges and universities have been greatly expanding what they do-and , as long as they spend the rising tuition on something , that something will be called a cost . <p> Expanding Empires <p> Expanding bureaucracies have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put it more directly , it is one of the things on which colleges spend their increased revenues . From 1975 to 1985 , for example , while student enrollment nationally rose by less than 10% , college professional support staffs increased by more than 60% . ( By professional support staff is meant people whose jobs require degrees but who do not teach students . ) At Stanford University , the president , vice-presidents , and their staffs added up to 47 people in 1977 , but this increased to 83 people by 1988 . Colleges and universities have also created new campuses and student centers overseas . Stanford opened overseas student centers in Italy and France in 1960 , Spain in 1968 , Germany in 1975 , England in 1984 , Poland in 1986 , Japan in 1989 , and Chile in 1990 . Nor are overseas campuses or student centers limited to a handful of elite institutions . Innumerable colleges have them , either singly or collectively in consortium arrangements . The University of Evansville , for example , has its own 55-acre campus in England and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> At the University of South Carolina , the president has spent as much as $879 a night for his hotel rooms while traveling and $7,000 in one year for chauffeur services . The university has also paid $350,000 in travel and salary to the widow of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat , for teaching one class a week for three semesters . All of these are " costs . " A federal investigation of " costs " which Stanford University charged against government research grants turned up $3,000 for a cedar-lined chest and $2,000 a month for flower arrangements , both at the home of Stanford President Donald Kennedy , as well as more than $180,000 charged as depreciation on a yacht privately donated to the university 's athletic department . The taxpayers were also charged for part of the cost of a $17,500 wedding reception when Mr. Kennedy remarried in 1987 . <p> While these odd examples are not intended to be typical , they do demonstrate the enormous elasticity of the concept of " cost , " as used in the academic world-and hence its meaninglessness as a justification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is professors ' salaries , which rose faster than the rate of inflation , every year , during the decade of the 1980s . Added to this is the normal tendency toward expansionism in organizations not checked by the competition of the marketplace and the grim realities of a bottom line . At Vassar College , the vice president for finance said : " Vassar 's departments are consulted for projected costs for the following year . Usually included are proposals for new materials and projects . " The college administration then " tries to allow as much departmental expansion as possible " - and this in turn drives up tuition . <p> As a comprehensive economic study of American colleges and universities concluded , " the cost of any institution is largely determined by the amount of revenue it can raise . " This was said , not by a critic , but by a man described as " the supreme defender of higher education . " In other words , it is the amount of money that colleges and universities can get-from tuition , endowment income , donations , etc. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , not the other way around , as they represent it to the public . To say that costs are going up is no more than to say that the additional intake is being spent , rather than hoarded . <p> When a college expands its range of expensive activities first , and then calls it " increased costs " later , when seeking more money from various sources , this tends not only to confuse the issue but also to erode the very concept of living within one 's means . The financial problems of wellendowed Bowdoin College illustrate the process and the attitudes . Its own professors and administrators have blamed its ballooning deficits on a decade of expanding programs , jobs , and buildings . As the dean of the college put it : " People would come forward with plans that were good ideas-and because it was a period in which we could afford to grow , we just said ' Yes ' without being very deliberate about it . " <p> According to the Chronicle of Higher Education : " Many faculty members did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when they read about them in the Maine Times . Several administrators say they also were unaware of the magnitude of the problem until last year . " <p> This situation was not unique to Bowdoin , or even to rich private colleges in general . A consultant looking into the finances of Oregon State University reached very similar conclusions : " It 's amazing how much in a university , processes are added on and added on , and no one takes a critical look at it . " <p> In short , when parents are being asked to draw on the equity in their homes to pay rising tuition , it is not simply to cover the increased cost of educating their children , but also to help underwrite the many new boondoggles thought up by faculty and administrators , operating with little sense of financial constraints . To quote an official of the U.S. Department of Education , many colleges " choose to increase tuition because they can get away with it . " While colleges claim that the increased spending is to improve education , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ranks of vice presidents and deans " and to other costly endeavors which make little or no contribution to quality education , which is " not a function of money . " The availability of federal grants and loans to help students meet rising tuition costs virtually ensures that those costs will rise . A college which kept tuition affordable could forfeit millions of dollars annually in federal money available to cover costs over and above what students can afford , according to a financial-aid formula . Misleading Excuses <p> Arguments have often been made that students are getting a good deal from college , because tuition does not cover the full costs of their education . Such statements are much more difficult to check than they might seem to be . First of all , education is not the only activity going on at research universities , and even at liberal-arts colleges research is increasingly expected of the professors . This research is paid for not only by faculty grants but also by reduced teaching loads-which is to say , by hiring far more professors than were required before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs may be carried on the books as instructional costs but they are in fact research costs . Almost anything can be treated as a cost of educating students-on paper . At the University of Texas , more than $11 million of student-fee payments were applied to paying for construction of a microelectronics research facility , located more than six miles away from the campus . <p> The research imperative has spread across all kinds of institutions and down the academic pecking order . Virtually everywhere , the education of undergraduates is a joint product , along with research and other activities . As any economist knows , there is no such thing as the average cost of producing pigskin , because it is produced jointly with bacon , ham , and pork chops . There is an average cost of producing a pig , but not its components , which can not be produced separately . <p> Even if it were possible to separate out the cost of undergraduate education , there is no reason why tuition should cover it , since alumni and other donors contribute money for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contributed for the same purpose . When college and university administrators expand their empires by raising tuition , this is not necessarily due to the rising cost of education . Nor are the " extras " necessarily an enhancement of education , or something reflecting student demand through the marketplace . In the public institutions , where most students go , it is largely a matter of administrators convincing legislators to contribute the taxpayers ' money . <p> It may seem odd that college-admissions directors are under heavy pressure to enroll more students , if the colleges are losing money on each student enrolled , as academic administrators so often claim . When Dartmouth vice president Robert Field announced that the college was accepting more transfer students , in order to bring in more revenue , the Dartmouth Review asked editorially : " How can Field make money on new students when every time he raises tuition , he claims tuition pays for only half the cost of each student ? " This probing question goes to the heart of the economic issue , and its answer depends upon incremental costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classroom buildings are in place , the additional or incremental cost of adding more students is relatively low , so long as their numbers do not exceed the existing capacity . Within those limits , adding more students may well bring in far more additional revenue than any additional costs they represent . <p> The claim by college administrators that tuition does not cover the average cost of a college education is both meaningless and misleading . It is meaningless because , as already noted , there is no such thing as the average cost of a joint product , and it is misleading because there is no more reason why tuition should cover all the costs of a college than there is for magazine subscriptions to cover all the costs of producing a magazine . Advertisers often pay most of the costs of producing a magazine or newspaper , each of which comprises joint products-journalistic writings and advertisements-just as academic institutions produce both teaching and research . No one believes that magazines are doing a favor to their subscribers by offering subscriptions at prices which do not cover the average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any such sanctimonious claims . <p> It is commonplace in the ordinary business transactions of the marketplace for joint products to be sold simultaneously to different groups , no one of which pays enough to cover the total costs of the business . A professional baseball team not only sells tickets to those who enter its stadium ; it also sells television and radio rights to broadcasters who cover the game , and rents out the stadium to others who use it for rock concerts , boxing matches , and other events while the team is on the road or during the off-season . If ticket prices for baseball games rose to exorbitant levels , it would be no answer to the fans to say that they were still not being charged enough to cover the total costs of the baseball club . Yet colleges and universities use this as an argument against students and their parents who complain about exorbitant tuition . Organized Collusion <p> In the ordinary transactions of the marketplace , competition from rival producers limits how much a given business can charge its customers . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most expensive colleges has stripped the students and their parents of this consumer protection . Each spring , for 35 years , the Ivy League colleges , plus MIT , Amherst , Northwestern , and a dozen other colleges and universities , met to decide how much money they would charge , as a net price , to each individual student , out of more than 10,000 students who had applied to more than one institution in this cartel . The lists of students were compiled before the annual meetings , and officials from the various colleges decided how much money could be extracted from each individual , given parental income , bank-account balance , home equity , and other financial factors . Where their estimates differed , these differences were reconciled in the meetings and the student then received so-called financial-aid offers , which meant that the net cost of going to one college in the cartel would be the same as the net cost of going to another . <p> The U.S. Department of Justice began investigating these and other colleges in 1989 . With a legal threat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit on behalf of students , hanging over this group of colleges , pending the outcome of the investigation , Yale and Barnard dropped out of the meetings in 1990 , and in 1991 the meetings were canceled . <p> A cartel or a monopoly maximizes its profit by charging not only a high price but also , if possible , a different price to different groups of customers , according to what the market will bear in each separate case . Seldom can most business cartels or monopolies carry this to the ultimate extreme of charging each individual customer what the traffic will bear , as the academic cartel does . But academic institutions are armed with more detailed financial information from financial-aid forms than most credit agencies require , and for decades have been comparing notes when setting their prices , in a way that would long ago have caused a business to be prosecuted for violation of the antitrust laws . In other respects , however , the colleges and universities use the same methods as business cartels or monopolies . Like monopolistic price discriminators in the commercial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list price and then offer varying discounts . In academia , this list price is called tuition and the discount is called " financial aid . " <p> The widespread availability of financial aidoften received by more than half the students at the more expensive colleges-changes the whole nature of tuition . Back when scholarships were awarded to a needy fraction of the students , this was clearly a matter of philanthropy and reward for academic ability . Today , varying amounts of financial aid are awarded up and down the income scale , and very little of it has anything to do with the quality of the student 's academic record or with philanthropy to the poor . Approximately two-thirds of the undergraduates at Harvard and four-fifths of those at Rice receive financial aid . The average family income of financial-aid recipients at Harvard in academic year 1990-91 was $45,000 . These financial-aid recipients included more than 400 whose family incomes were above $70,000 , of whom 64 came from families with incomes exceeding $100,000 . <p> Harvard is not unique in this respect . At Marquette University , out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from families with incomes of $60,000 to $70,000 and who applied for financial aid , 71 were declared eligible for it , as were 74 out of 192 students from families with incomes above $70,000 . Similar figures are common at other private colleges and universities . The president of MIT noted that financial-aid applicants at that institution " are distributed almost uniformly across the spectrum of family income . " The percentage of applicants who receive aid typically varies by income level and so does the amount of the aid received , so that the net price actually charged is adjusted to the most that can be extracted from each applicant 's family . <p> Price Discrimination <p> Ordinarily , price discrimination does not work in a competitive marketplace , because those charged extortionate prices will be bid away by competitors , until the price is competed down to a level commensurate with the cost of producing whatever commodity or service is being sold . But this does not happen among high-priced colleges which engage in organized collusion . The picture is complicated somewhat by the fact that the term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listed in college catalogues and actual transfers of money-the great bulk of this money being government-provided or government-subsidized . Philanthropic aid also continues , enabling a needy fraction of students to cover their cost of living , as well as tuition . Fundamentally , however , college-provided financial aid is a method of producing a sliding scale of tuition charges , like ordinary price discrimination elsewhere-and like successful price discrimination elsewhere , it is a byproduct of collusion . For example , when one student found that the financial-aid packages offered by Brown University and by Yale were inadequate to enable him to attend either institution , his efforts to get an increase were complicated by the fact that " each could alter a package only after consulting with the other . " <p> This collusion process has been made easier by the remarkable similarity of tuitions among those in the cartel-despite differences in urban or rural location , endowment income per student , local cost-of-living variations , the size of the student body over which the institutional overhead was spread , and other such economic considerations which normally lead to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different costs per student " among institutions . Yet in 1989-90 , for example , the variation in tuition among the eight Ivy League colleges was less than 5% from the most expensive ( Brown ) to the least expensive ( Cornell ) , even though Ivy League colleges are scattered from Manhattan to rural New Hampshire . <p> Officials of some colleges and universities admit not only to sharing information on financial-aid offers to specific students but also to sharing information on pending tuition increases and faculty salaries . This has all the appearance of a multidimensional " price-fixing system that OPEC might envy , " as the Wall Street Journal characterized it-and is a clear violation of American antitrust laws when businessmen do such things . <p> The time , then , is long overdue to begin applying the same legal standards to academia as to everyone else-and for the media , donors , trustees , and the public to begin scrutinizing colleges and universities , and viewing their pious statements with the same skepticism they apply to self-serving statements from other institutions . <p> <p> This article is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Deception , the Dogmas , to be published by the Free Press in February 1992 , and is reprinted , with permission , from the August 1992 Commentary . <p>
