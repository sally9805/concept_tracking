<p> Into the night roars the multitude , looking for a clean , well- lighted place - or perhaps a gloomy , well-amplified dungeon - to call home for a few hours . What awaits could be the excitement , risk and surprise of the next big thing . . . or just the reassuringly familiar sound of the same old song . <p> Finding good live music in Atlanta on any given night is a diverse and far-flung proposal , which these at-a-glance capsules only begin to address . As Nirvana , a band that 's known a few dungeons in its short time , sings , " Here we are now , entertain us . " Here are a few highly arbitrary suggestions for where you can hum the chorus any day of the week. ; Saturday <p> Atlanta 's largest blues club and the hottest ticket in Underground Atlanta , Blues Harbor gets high marks for the array of performers it books every night of the week - from R &B; great Charles Brown , who returns Feb. 7 and 8 , to the greasiest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as Willie Lockett and the Blues Krewe , who perform tonight and Sunday . Too bad its stage placement is so clumsy , plopped dead in front of a central bar so that only a lucky few stool-jockeys can get a full , unobstructed view . It 's frustrating , as is the clatter of patrons more interested in dining than listening . But when the music 's good , it transcends the neck strain . <p> 155 Kenny 's Alley at Underground Atlanta . 524-3001 . Seven days a week . Live music from 9:30 p.m . Cover charge varies . <p> Black-box sister to The Cotton Club , The Point rocks hardest toward the weekend . Tonight 's gig by rockabilly minimalists Southern Culture on the Skids will likely have a sardine-packed crowd dancing wildly until last call . Shows go way late , and vary from can't-miss to don't-touch-it , with a slant toward local faves and college-radio regulars . Patrons lacking either a leather jacket or a vivid tattoo may feel underdressed . <p> 420 Moreland Ave . N.E. 577-6468 . Seven days a week . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Polyrhythms flow around a trombone 's fat-bottomed wail , silk shirts and high heels go into motion . Saturday night at Chicago 's Latin Dance Club could be Miami or San Juan or the Bronx , but no . It 's . . . Smyrna . This pulsing , once-a-week live scene - which promises to expand in February - flourishes after hours in an upscale restaurant , tucked away in an otherwise anonymous office park off Cobb Parkway at Interstate 285 . The music , featuring either one of two Atlanta-based groups - Orquesta Taboga and Orquesta Lyrica - is hot , hot , hot . The crowd , well-dressed and 90 percent Latin , is smooth on the dance floor , but the L-shaped club makes plenty of room for couples who prefer to listen . <p> 900 Circle 75 Parkway . 10 p.m. 980-6300. $ 8 . ; Sunday <p> Blues abounds at Blind Willie 's , which won the reputation as Mick Jagger 's favorite hang when the Glimmer Twin was in town making " Freejack " last year . But you should n't need a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Virginia-Highland . Slightly larger than a closet , the compact club offers the gamut of American roots music - zydeco , rhythm-and-blues , blues , folk , country and Cajun - with a bent toward rediscovered legends such as Louisiana accordion king Boozoo Chavis and Georgia guitarist Robert Ward .

Live music from 9:30 p.m. $ 3-5 . ; Monday <p> A trio cooking by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and plenty of deluxe hors d'oeuvres to nosh on make The Bar at Ritz- Carlton Buckhead a class ticket for jazz listening . The gentleman 's clubroom atmosphere is a little stuffy and weekend patrons tend to yak over some often fine music , but the venue books top local musicians and a series of national acts that fit comfortably within the tradition . Performances are anchored around a Steinway Grand piano that has served performers as esteemed as Ellis Marsalis and Kenny Barron . Acoustics are up-close and personal . Next week , pianist Gary Motley leads a trio , featuring Atlanta legend Laymon Jackson on bass . <p> 3434 Peachtree Road N.E. 237-2700 . Monday-Saturday .

Fat Matt 's may not be as real as the Mississippi chicken shacks in photographer Birney Imes 's book " Juke Joint , " but it 's as real as you 'll ever find on Piedmont Ave . No cover and $ 1 Pabst Blue Ribbon draft , not to mention some tasty chopped pork , make this a hot ticket , with music by local bands working their way up the blues chain of being . One group , the Mighty Fine Slabs , even takes its name from the tangy ribs that sizzle in the kitchen . <p> 1811 Piedmont Road . 607-1622 . Seven days a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> No less a platform for emerging local bands , The Wreck Room is one of the few places where untried acts can pay some low-risk dues .
