Section : THEATER <p> Night after night troupes from all over the Spanish-speaking world and the United States perform Calderon and Cervantes , Lope de Vega and Moreto , at the annual Siglo de Oro Drama Festival in El Paso , Texas . Sometimes the productions are elaborate and traditional ; sometimes they are sparse and avant-garde . Occasionally , they are electrifying . After each performance , participants meet to share ideas . <p> Every April hundreds of theater people , academics and general spectators participate in the two-week-long festival at the Chamizal National Memorial , which is sponsored by the U.S. National Park Service . Just as in Lope de Vega 's day , the plays are popular events that attract spectators from every walk of life . Laborers in their work clothes , grandmothers and infants , students and secretaries sit side by side with business professionals and artists , often chatting about the plays in English and Spanish . <p> This year 's gathering featured spectacles as diverse as a three-and-a-half-hour production by Mexico 's Compania de Teatro Corral of Lope de Vega 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Calderon 's El alcalde de Zalamea ; a series of highlights from Golden Age plays presented by two actors from the Compania Francisco Portes , of Madrid ; and an adaptation by Mexico City 's Grupo Tarumba of the prologue to Sor Juana 's El divino narcisco , which included some colorful Aztec-inspired dances . The most controversial production was an adaptation of San Juan de la Cruz 's Canticos espirituales , by Tiempo Comun of Venezuela , which incorporated Indian , Afro-Hispanic , and Brazilian music . The piece raised eyebrows not only because of the unconventional nature of the material ( after all , San Juan was a mystic poet , not a playwright ) , but also because of the playful manner in which director Hugo Marquez approached the work , the graphic eroticism of some segments , and the very Latin American tone Marquez gave to the verse . <p> The Spanish Golden Age , which lasted roughly from the beginning of the sixteenth century until the end of the seventeenth , may seem an unusual theme for an annual event on the U.S.-Mexican border , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Affairs for the memorial , it was a perfect choice in view of the history of the Chamizal . Reid explains that the Chamizal Memorial was formed as part of a 1963 agreement between the United States and Mexico . The Rio Grande had been established as the border between the two countries more than a century before , but the river kept meandering , leaving communities sometimes on the Mexican side , sometimes on the U.S. side . Presidents John F. Kennedy and Adolfo Lopez Mateos resolved to cement the bottom of the river  --  thereby preventing it from changing course-and to divide the land . Three-fourths of the area went to Mexico , while the rest went to the Unites States . <p> Both nations made commemorative parks out of the land . The Park Service took over the U.S. portion and Congress established that the Chamizal Memorial would become a monument to culture and the arts . In 1967 President Lyndon Johnson finalized the settlement and in 1971 Franklin G. Smith was appointed superintendent of the Chamizal . Thanks to Smith 's vision and sensitivity , the Park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States . The Chamizal opened in 1973 with a Border Folk Festival that celebrated Mexican popular arts . Other cultural activities followed , including a jazz festival and a variety of historical projects , but the jewel in the Chamizal crown was the Siglo de Oro Theater Festival . <p> Smith hit on the idea of a celebration of Spanish Golden Age drama when he began to look around for a theme that would be rich in possibilities and appealing to the population of El Paso , which is about 70 percent Hispanic . " It was a natural , " explains Walker Reid . " Here was a juicy piece of literature  --  that is , a literary period that included hundreds of writers . Besides , no one else was doing anything like it . " The fact that two major Golden Age authors , Juan Ruiz de Alarcon and Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz , were born in Mexico was another plus , according to Reid . " Coming out of the settlement between the United States and Mexico , " he explains , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the Siglo de Oro Festival fit the theme perfectly . " <p> The Festival , which opened in 1976 , became Reid 's special project , since he had a background in theater and Spanish and Latin American literature . In 1965 he founded the Community Theater of Guatemala , in Guatemala City , and was its director until 1967 . Since then , he has been in contact with countless Latin American theater groups , many of which he has brought to Texas for the Festival . For the last eighteen years he has coordinated practically every aspect of the Siglo de Oro Festival , reaching out to companies , organizing the program , working out details with immigration , procuring lodgings for the troupes , and attending to countless other details . <p> From the beginning the Chamizal sponsored a theater competition to stimulate interest in the Festival and encourage groups to participate . George Woodyard , then a professor at the University of Kansas and editor of the Latin American Theater Review , served as the first academic judge and helped guide Reid around the theater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spain . Although only four groups participated in the first festival , over the years the competition has grown in size and scope . Now there are two categories  --  professional and nonprofessional  --  with prizes offered in each . Three judges from theatrical and academic circles assess the plays . " We 've become more demanding , " says Reid . " We no longer encourage novice groups to apply . " But even though standards have become higher and Reid has become more selective in admitting troupes to the competition , he still reaches out to promising amateurs . " This year we really got the best , " he explains , " because , in honor of the Quincentennial of the Discovery of America , we spent the money to go after top-notch professional groups . We 've grown qualitatively as well as quantitatively . " However , Reid explains , financial restrictions will undoubtedly force him to limit the number of companies that participate in next year 's festival to eight or ten . <p> In selecting participants , Reid looks for experienced companies , whether or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been performed before at the Festival . He also looks for tough , dogged directors who are capable of obtaining funding , since the National Park Service pays only room and board for two days for each company , as well as a small honorarium based on the type of performance and the distance the group has to travel . Since the companies have to pay most of their own expenses , including plane fare , they must appeal to government organizations and private institutions to finance the trip . Reid mentions directors such as Juan Moran of Mexico , Hugo Marquez of Venezuela , and Francisco Portes of Spain , as examples of obstinate go-getters who have managed to obtain funding year after year . Some groups depend on universities ; others , such as Tarumba , directed by Felio Eliel , receive help from organizations such as the Instituto de Bellas Artes in Mexico . <p> In 1980 Smith and Reid introduced the nightly Mesa Redonda , or discussion group . Led by an academic or a theater person , the Mesa Redonda allows directors , actors , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range of topics . Smith 's original idea was to bring the fraternity of Siglo de Oro scholars closer to the theatrical people who actually perform the plays , thereby changing the way academics think of their profession . For years the classics of Golden Age theater had been studied as literature , but few students of Lope de Vega and Calderon actually had seen their plays performed . <p> In 1981  --  as part of the tricentennial celebration of the death of Calderon  --  Smith and Reid proposed that Professor Arturo Perez of the University of Texas , El Paso , organize a symposium in conjunction with the Festival . Now run by Professors John Amastae of UTEP and Sharon Voros of the United States Naval Academy , the symposium has grown into one of the most significant gatherings of Golden Age scholars in the United States . In addition to the Mesa Redonda , the symposium sponsors a daily Encuentro limited exclusively to academics and theater people , which provides additional opportunities for discussion . But what professors seem to like best is the chance to live and breathe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lectures and meetings , but at breakfast , lunch and dinner they meet to talk over the performances , their research , and their classroom experiences . <p> The success of the Chamizal Festival in the academic community was due in great part to the efforts of Professor Don Dietz , then at Texas Tech University . Dietz became the founder and driving force behind the Association for Hispanic Classical Theater , an organization devoted to the performance aspect of Golden Age Theater . Dietz and other academics , such as Vern G. Williamsen and David Gitlitz , conceived the idea of videotaping the plays performed at the Festival and making them available to professors of Golden Age Theater for use in their classrooms . Now , some ten years later , the Association not only lends hundreds of tapes to its members , but provides grants for the production of Golden Age dramas in English . <p> Much of the excitement of the Chamizal Festival derives from the great variety of theatrical experiences it provides . But the tight schedules that different nightly performances demand often cause problems . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " explains Walker Reid . " The next morning , they 're working with our technicians on the show that will go up that night ! " Since 1987 , the companies that perform at the Chamizal have been taking their shows across the border to Juarez the next day . There they perform twice , once for a general audience and once for school children . Sometimes they go on to perform in Mexico City . " Unless some groups can get additional engagements in Mexico City , " explained Reid , " they simply can not afford to come . It is just too expensive for a director to bring a group of twelve to fourteen actors , who have to be paid , transported , lodged and fed , unless he can do some additional shows . " During the last several years , the Mexico 's Programa Cultural de las Fronteras has provided funding to help some professional groups with their transportation . <p> In spite of the financial obstacles , Reid foresees an exciting future for the Chamizal Festival . He hopes to continue to reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and continued high standards . He is already planning next year 's program , which will include a version of Moreto 's El desden con el desden , by the Chicago Opera Factory , a company known for its Zarzuelas , as well as one full-length production by the Compania Francisco Portes and another by the Centro de Arte Dramatico , a Mexican company directed by Hector Azar , that performs plays by Alarcon exclusively . <p> " The Chamizal Festival is the highlight of the year , " says one El Paso resident . " As soon as one is over , I 'm looking forward to the next !
