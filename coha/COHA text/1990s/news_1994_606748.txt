<p> As U.S. Navy ships fired blanks from their guns to simulate a bombardment , American and Philippine Marines today stormed ashore in a reenactment of the U.S. invasion 50 years ago that liberated the Philippines from Japanese occupation . <p> Under a blazing sun  --  an expected typhoon veered away  --  an old Philippine T-28 fighter plane emblazoned with a rising sun flew low over the beach to portray Japanese air attacks . Then 50 U.S. Marines and about 200 Philippine soldiers , all dressed in World War II uniforms and carrying vintage carbines , hit the beaches . An American actor playing the role of Gen. Douglas MacArthur stumbled into the surf from a landing craft as soldiers raised the American and Philippine flags . <p> For Walter Kleinschmidt and his fellow GIs , the real " A-Day " began with a thunderous roar . After a furious naval bombardment , MacArthur 's forces invaded Leyte to make good his famous vow , " I shall return . " <p> But Kleinschmidt 's 96th Infantry Division soon found itself battling not only thousands of die-hard Japanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jungle diseases , impenetrable swamps , three typhoons and an earthquake . Pinned down by machine-gun and mortar fire below a hill the Americans dubbed Bloody Ridge , the young squad leader 's company lost more than half its men , then ran out of ammunition . <p> " At that moment , when the Japanese could have come over and wiped us out , they quit and retreated , " Kleinschmidt recalled . " It was like an act of God . " The farmer from Jacksonville , Ill. , made it through the Philippine campaign , but a bullet wound in the neck on Okinawa in April 1945 left him partially paralyzed on his left side . <p> Today the wiry 73-year-old is among more than 3,000 U.S. veterans and family members who have returned to Leyte to commemorate their Oct. 20 , 1944 , landing . The invasion cut Japan 's World War II empire in half and , MacArthur later wrote in his memoirs , established the Philippines as a springboard " for the final assault against Japan itself . " <p> Within days of the landing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called the greatest naval battle in history . In desperation , the Japanese launched their first suicidal kamikaze attacks as part of a plan to isolate and destroy the 700-vessel U.S. invasion flotilla . It almost worked . But in the Battle of Leyte Gulf , involving 282 warships on both sides , the U.S. Navy decimated the Japanese fleet and consolidated control of the Pacific , which has been a virtual " American lake " ever since . <p> The invasion also led to the destruction of Manila , where an estimated 100,000 Filipinos died during a siege that left the capital as the most damaged allied city after Warsaw . Many residents were killed by U.S. shelling , but thousands more were slaughtered by rampaging Japanese marines in a bloodbath that rivaled the 1937 Rape of Nanking in China . <p> The commemoration thus has raised old controversies about those tragic events and new questions about the relationship between the United States and its former colony . Filipinos are debating anew such issues as U.S. responsibility for the country 's devastation , Washington 's treatment of Philippine veterans and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1964 . Leftists are challenging the government 's current efforts to strengthen military ties with the United States and asking whether the invasion half a century ago really marked a liberation or merely a reoccupation . <p> President Fidel Ramos originally had hoped to turn the Leyte anniversary into Asia 's answer to the D-Day commemoration at Normandy in June , and he repeatedly tried to persuade President Clinton to attend . Instead , Clinton has scheduled a stop in Manila on his way to an Asia-Pacific summit in Jakarta in mid-November . MacArthur 's 92-year-old widow , Jean MacArthur , could not make it either , but sent greetings from Norfolk , Va . <p> Joining the American veterans on Leyte were a U.S. delegation led by Defense Secretary William J. Perry and Gen. John Shalikashvili , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , dignitaries from more than a dozen other nations including Japan and thousands of Filipinos who fought in guerrilla groups or U.S.-organized military units during the war . They gathered to watch a reenactment of the invasion by an armada that includes six U.S. Navy ships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ navy ships , three from Australia and one each from France and Thailand . <p> The Philippine air force also is supplying 30 planes  --  most of its inventory  --  for the occasion , including World War II-vintage T-28 models that are still in use . <p> American Ken Metcalf , an actor in action movies , fell onto all fours in the surf as he waded ashore at Palo , which the Americans called Red Beach . He and Philippine actors playing then-President Sergio Osmena , Gen. Carlos Romulo and other participants rode a vintage jeep to the provincial capital of Tacloban eight miles to the north , distributing chewing gum and candy to children on the way . <p> " People of the Philippines : I have returned , " MacArthur intoned in a radio address on the beach that day in 1944 . " The hour of your redemption is here . ... Rally to me . ... As the lines of battle roll forward to bring you within the zone of operations , rise and strike . ... For your homes and hearths , strike ! For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the name of your sacred dead , strike ! " <p> The call to arms against the more than 350,000 Japanese occupying the Philippines struck some Americans as vain and theatrical , but it had an electrifying effect on Filipinos . <p> " My reaction then was to cry for joy , " said columnist Emil Jurado , who was 18 at the time . All around him in the northern Philippines , he said , " soldiers and civilians alike ... had tears flowing down their cheeks . " <p> The landing sparked a surge of activity by Philippine guerrillas , who numbered more than 180,000 by the end of 1944 . But the Japanese responded with brutal repression , and thousands of civilians were massacred . <p> The invasion of Leyte by 200,000 U.S. troops culminated a 1,500-mile seaborne jump that has been called one of the most daring amphibious operations ever conceived . It also redeemed the promise of MacArthur to return to the Philippines after Japanese troops forced him to abandon his men on Corregidor and sail for Australia in March 1942 . The infamous Bataan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Americans died on the way to prison camps . <p> When the invasion forces landed at Leyte , the GIs faced debilitating conditions and an implacable foe . Typhoons dumped more than 30 inches of rain during the first month of fighting . <p> " Our fatigues rotted off of us , " said Donald O. Dencker , a returning veteran from Sun Prairie , Wis . " We had more illness casualties than battle casualties on Leyte  --  jungle rot , dengue fever , dysentery , you name it . " <p> More than 65,000 Japanese soldiers fought to the death on Leyte . Only a handful surrendered . The Americans listed 3,500 GIs killed on the island and 12,000 wounded . But bloodier fighting was yet to come on the northern island of Luzon and in the battle for Manila . <p> By the time the war ended in August 1945 , about 320,000 Japanese occupation troops were dead . Out of a total U.S. force that grew to more than 300,000 troops , 15,000 died in the campaign and 48,000 were wounded . But the heaviest toll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as 1 million dead out of a population of 18 million . <p> Should the Philippines have been bypassed on the American drive toward Japan , as the U.S. Navy had urged ? Antonio Madrigal thinks so . Now 76 , the former aide to President Osmena is the last surviving member of MacArthur 's landing party . <p> " There would have been no fighting , no damage , no casualties , " he said . " But who would dare contradict MacArthur ? " <p> Dencker , who is now an engineering consultant , calls the argument moot . " MacArthur would n't let us bypass the Philippines , " he said . " He had a sacred pledge . "
