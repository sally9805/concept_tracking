I 'M NOT bad-looking , and ( B ) I 've never ( A ) had any trouble finding girls , so ( C ) what I did that night was not the act of a desperate self  --  deluded jerk . Only I know what you 're thinking and that is : who the hell is this jerk ? To which I 'd have to say that I 'm no more or less a jerk than anyone else my sister tells me about . <p> I love my sister , okay ? But she 's allowed herself to become a parody of herself , uptight to the point of implosion , thinks that everyone 's looking at her as if they can hear her ovaries aging , and that if she 's not married by thirty-one , thirty-two , she 's history , may as well hang up her skimpy underthings and retire to Tampa , take up shuffleboard . It 's a hostile attitude . She 's smart , too , way too smart to fall for that crap , but there 's nothing I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any different than she already does , which is : men are all scum , except for the ones , like the ones our parents are always pushing on her , who are wimps with unimpressive johnsons ( her expression , not mine ) . <p> She tells me stories : the guy who sent roses to her every night for two weeks until she agreed to steep with him , and then she sleeps with him , and it 's great only guess what ? He has to leave right afterward to go back to his place in case his girlfriend who lives in Jersey calls-oh , you mean I did n't mention my girlfriend ? The lawyer who took her out to dinner and then , holding her hand , told her all about his psychotherapy , and actually began to cry . ( It was disgusting , she said . His eyes got red and he kept dribbling all over his dinner napkin . ) The investment banker with the proverbial neckties from Barney 's and the platinum Am Ex card only he 's built on the dainty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Poof , she says . Then he 's snoring . ) <p> So I figure that , compared to these guys , I 'm not so bad . But my sister says no , because I 'm one , too , worse , in fact , than any jerk-off who 's ever messed with her . But by now she 's partisan , ca n't be trusted . She wanted her chance to stand in front of all those people and maybe get a chance to catch the bridal bouquet and God knows what else because the entire way that females think is alien to me , and if I were smart I 'd join some silent monks in France or Indiana , if they 'd have me , or if not then sign on with the Lubavitchers , marry some nice , terrified eighteenyear-old and maybe , if I 'm lucky , drown myself in so much overcooked pot roast and Manischewitz that I can no longer remember what girls smell like . <p> This is what happened : what happened was that there was Robin , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd known in college who we used to call Free Love because once , in a poetry seminar when we were comparing the love sonnets of John Donne to those of Shakespeare , she said something along the lines of her believing in free love , and then while the rest of us snickered and looked at our feet she explained that what she 'd meant had to do with the difference between formal patterns of sound versus the abandonment of traditional versification as in her favorite , Walt Whitman , the ultimate master of free verse-but as far as I could tell , the only person who was interested in this bullshit was the professor , a middle-aged lesbian who had the bad habit of playing with her middle-aged acne . Needless to say , this was back when I had poetic aspirations my@ self , long before I chucked my youthful idealism and adolescent passions for a law degree and , as of this writing , one-ten-a-year plus bonus , office on the 21 st floor , great secretary , and an endless supply of free paper clips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something else , too : smart in that intense , overly animated way of a person with an inflated sense of the superiority of her own soul , plus a serious looker , with a body that would n't quit . She was so beautiful that every time I looked at her my tongue swelled up in my mouth and I became hyperconscious of how much saliva I was producing . But during her freshman year she kind of took on half the rugby team , and later got into women , or at least that 's what the girlfriend I had during the first semester of my last year of college told me . She said : I know she 's pretty if you like that slutty type but let 's face it , Hank , she 's probably got some kind of disease . Then she told me that , on a dare , Free Love had done it with a banana at some dance club in the East Village during spring break . All I had to do was think of this girl with a banana-her underpants around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to attention like a West Point cadet . <p> This is what she looked like : she looked like a total fantasy from California or some place where they grow them like that-tall and shapely-and with this beautiful , heart-shaped face and these kind of slanty brown eyes and long dark wild hair that she raked her hands through as if she were auditioning for a shampoo commercial . Later , when I got to know her a little bit , people were always coming up to her and saying : you look just like that movie star , you know the one I mean , the one who was in .... But the totally most amazing thing about Free Love was that she was n't from some exotic tribe of **31;232;TOOLONG at all , but from Trenton , where her mother worked as secretary to the rabbi in the Reform temple where she 'd been bat-mitzvahed , and her dad worked for Exxon , something to do with emission control . Trenton , which is almost as bad as being from Newark-or , for that matter , Ozone Park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , MORON , is what I know you 're saying . So you had a thing for this Jewish girl from Trenton . So what about it ? Did you or did you not ? And what about this other girl , this Robin , your fiancee ? Where 'd she come from ? And who wants to hear about how horny you were in college which is such an old story that it makes me cry with boredom ? Ever hear of Philip Roth , genius ? Did n't he already do this one ? Like maybe a half-dozen times ? How big is your whizmaster , anyway ? Why are n't you in therapy ? <p> A few years after I finished law school I ran into Free Love-Emily-on Madison Avenue , between Forty-fifth and Forty-sixth . It was early March , cold and wet . She was hurrying past with that intense forward-looking expression that all women get once they 've been in New York for more than a week , carrying a styrofoam take-out carton . Her hair was wet , slicked back , and her feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked right past me even though I called out her name , and then , when I turned around to catch up to her , she looked at me with no recognition at all . <p> It 's Hank , I said , Hank Wolf , from school . We had a poetry class together . Sophomore year . <p> I 'm sorry I do n't remember . <p> I did n't talk much , I said . She looked at me as if I were a con-man or an insurance broker trying to sell her whole-life even though she 's not yet thirty . So I went : not like you . With your free verse . <p> I 'm going to be late for work , she said . <p> I 'd like to say that I ran after her , calling her name and giving her additional hints about my identity-you know , I was the idiot who used to sit near the door and doze off ; or , I knew you when you were Free Love , do you still do it with bananas ? - but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her for six blocks , until I saw her disappear , along with a few dozen other great-looking women , into the Conde Nast building . Then I went back to my own office on Lexington , where I was working , if memory serves , on a case involving faulty ceiling  --  fan parts . <p> And from there it was easy , because I figured all I had to do was call the Conde Nast switchboard to get put through to her , and when I did I stammered all over myself and apologized and generally begged and she talked to me for a long time and it turned out that she worked for Vogue . Vogue ? my sister said when I told her about it . So what ? She 's probably a secretary . Spends her days answering the phone . Either that or maybe she places advertisements . Vogue . Big deal . <p> What I 'd said when I got her on the phone was : I had a crush on you for all four years of college will you please have lunch with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't really matter , anyway , because by then I was seriously involved with Robin , a lovely girl , and I know I sound patronizing but I do n't mean to be . My sister 's like : you are a total pig how can you justify your scumbag existence get out of my face . Even my secretary-I share her with a junior partner-said as much , only of course she could n't be quite so straightforward , verbally . She was more like : are you sure you know what you 're doing ? My best friend from high school , Sam , who 's gone Hollywood , is the only male person I tell any of this stuff to and his opinion was , so what ? Only , as my sister pointed out , Sam writes sit-coms , or at least he 's trying to , so why should I trust his opinion on anything ? <p> But Robin was lovely , as lovely as any girl I 've ever known , as lovely and sweet and gentle as a person can be without becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like me . I met her in law school . Like me , she 'd grown up local : in her case , Jamaica Estates . She was my height exactly , which is five-nine-she said it made her feel overgrown and excessive-and very very steady . Everything about her was steady : her quiet , steady , brown-eyed gaze ; the slow , graceful motions of her fingers and hands as she chopped green beans or worked on her computer ; her rise and fall under or over me . She and I spent countless hours drinking coffee and cramming for exams and going out for middle-of-the-night Chinese before it dawned on either of us to touch each other , and then when we started , neither one of us saw any reason to stop , and after that it was just a hop to being a kind of semipermanent couple , and my mother was going around telling all her friends that I had a very nice girlfriend who was-there is a God-Jewish . <p> What I told my sister about Emily , because it was true , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Yeah , she was different , she said . She made it with bananas . ) But I mean , even then , there were girls-guys , too-who already had the mark of middle age on them . I mean , you could tell , just by glancing at them , not only what they were going to look like ten or twenty years later but what they were going to do , and where they were going to live , and how they were going to decorate their living rooms and what books they 'd have on their bookshelves , if any . You could take one look and see : future CPA two kids one basset hound splitlevel in Cherry Hill spends his weekends gardening . Or : frustrated concert pianist turned thirdgrade teacher with lots of tribal rugs and hardwood floors . Or : marries for money but denies it until she starts having affairs . You could see the trips to the dentist and the carpool rides in the minivan and the requisite **27;265;TOOLONG where the sex is satisfying but not quite quite what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stable marriage which is more than I can say for some people . Or : spineless attorney who settles into a steady but dull marriage because he does n't have the guts to do anything original , fools around in a desultory kind of way , ends up living in a condo in West Hole , New Jersey , sees his kids every other weekend , only they do n't like him . <p> But with Emily , it was different . You could look at her , stare at her like I did , and come up with nothing . And it was n't only that she was beautiful , because there were a lot of beautiful girls-my own sister 's great-looking only she thinks she needs to lose ten pounds . She says : you are delusional . <p> THE NEXT part is tricky because it could n't have happened at all without the bizarre timing of things . The background is : Robin and I are steady . But also , okay , I 'm beginning to see Emily , first only for lunch , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very casual , very low-key , because it is n't like we 're dating or anything , we 're just hanging out , because it turns out that Emily has a boyfriend , only the boyfriend is n't around much , because he is-get this-getting a combined Ph.D . and law degree from Yale . Meanwhile in her eyes the fact that I 'm pulling down decent money means squat because I went to Brooklyn Law School , which is where you go if you do n't even know where Yale is . <p> In the meantime , she tells me all kinds of crap about herself . how she still writes poetry , even though she knows it 's hopeless ; how she 's bored to tears at Vogue , where her job involves editing the movie-star column and something to do with shoes , or maybe it was hats ; how she 's thinking about going back to school herself , maybe in linguistics , which she 's very interested in , she 's always had a knack for languages ; how she believes in God ; how she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids . And I 'm thinking : what about the banana ? <p> One day Emily and I meet for lunch-it was one of those brilliant warm early October afternoons where all of a sudden people who usually look fat and pasty and sticky look , through your fevered , feverish eyes , merely achingly , tragically human . I remember it exactly : Emily 's wearing white pants , a white blouse , a white sweater . And I mean everything is white white , like something a nurse would wear , only on her it looks fantastic . Her wild brown hair is doing its usual electrified number all over her head , and she has these big fat bangles on , and this bright red lipstick , and they say that men do n't pick up on these things unless they 're gay . I want to make love to her right then and there on the corner where we meet but instead we go to a deli and get sandwiches and eat on the steps of Saint Bart 's . Where she says : <p> I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months that we 've been hanging and so by now I know quite a bit about her , including the name of her boyfriend , Richard , and how brilliant and sweet he is , and how he 'll probably teach law himself one day , maybe even at Yale , blah blah blah blah . So I say : <p> New job ? <p> And she says : <p> Jesus . Are you blind ? And she flashes her hand in front of me and right there on it as big as Nebraska is a diamond ring . <p> He asked me this weekend , she says . <p> Then she chatters on about how happy and excited her mother is but how already she 's fighting with her about the details of the wedding , the date of which is n't even set yet , but already her mom is insisting on having it at Beth Shalom synagogue where her mom has worked for forever , and she does n't seem to notice that I 'm choking on my roast-beef sub . <p> Which is how , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engaged . One day I 'm telling Robin about this buddy of mine who 's taking the Deep Plunge , and the next day Robin starts talking about making a commitment , and this goes on for a few weeks , maybe a few months , I do n't know , because I 'm sunk into this depression that has me up nights with this awful combination of the hots and the sweats and sometimes I swear to God I wake up and there 's Robin sleeping right beside me but I have to go to the bathroom to take care of myself . And when I come out of the depression it 's spring again and I look at myself one morning in the mirror and realize that I 'm going gray at my temples and that the woman who has been sharing her body and soul with me for going on four years is as steady and decent and intelligent as they come . And that day I ask her to marry me . <p> IN HOLLYWOOD , my friend Sam is like : congratulations . Only it sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to tell you that we 've found a malignancy . My sister is going : well at least one of us is getting on with life it 's so much easier for guys I wish I had a dick . My mom is estatic . My dad us going around the house humming " When the Red Red Robin Comes Bob Bob Bobbin ' Along . " The only person who does n't react one way or an- other is Emily , because of course  --  and this is the part you 're going to incinerate me for  --  I never exactly ever got around to telling Emily about Robin . <p> At first I did n't because I held out this slim hopeless hope that maybe Emily would let me go to bed with her . And then I did n't because it never exactly came up which is-okay I admit it-not exactly true either : Emily asked me all the time about my love life , and I told her , too , only I never exactly told her the truth because the girls I made up  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and who had a mirror over her bed so she could watch herself while we went at it , or Jeannie Rubin the struggling folk singer who actually sang at the moment of highest pleasure-were a lot more interesting than Robin , and made her laugh . And when she laughed-big laughs coming out of her gut-her whole face turned red and her eyes watered and I felt like a million bucks , I know it sounds corny but it 's true . <p> But Emily and I had been seeing less of each other , anyway , mainly because every time I called her , for lunch or a movie , she was busy : she was spending more and more time with her fianc6 in New Haven , and then she was promoted at Vogue , and on top of that she started taking graduate classes at Columbia in postmodernist semiotics or some other bullshit . But then what happens is : she 's calling me one morning at work , crying into the phone , saying , oh God , I feel so stupid . <p> Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no , you 're at work . I 'll be fine . Are you sure ? It 's no trouble . No , really . Look , Emily , whatever it is , you should n't be alone . Well , okay . <p> This is my big moment . I 'm like : it 's an emergency , Susan , hold my calls . The crosstown traffic is murder , but when I finally get to Emily 's apartment it 's all worth it because there 's Emily saying oh God I 'm so sorry to do this to you but I just wanted a shoulder to cry on and when I say What ? What happened ? she says : Richard dumped me . And I 'm like : you 've got to be messing with me big time who would dump a babe like you but I 'm making all these sweet shushing noises and telling her that I 've been in love with her since the first time I saw her , in that poetry seminar in college . And God help me but I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in the East Village all those years ago , how drunk she must have been , or high , or both , or high on her own lust . And a minute later I 'm all over this girl . <p> You get your rocks off you get your rocks off , is my sister 's take on all things sexual , but then she likes to pretend that she 's a cynic . But it was-I swear to God Himself-more than that happy little burp at the end of things , it was sex like sex is in the movies ; the kind of sex that turns God into a voyeur ; sex like heat and lightning and thunder and dew . It was afterward , during our post-coital bliss phase , that I blew it . And this is where I made one little error in judgment , because if I had just been a little bit more of a scumbag , rather than less of one , none of what was about to happen would have happened , or at least not in the same sordid way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolute incomprehension and my sister is about ready to hang herself for the prophylactic benefits thereof . But in this fit of apr@s-sex arousal and desire , I 'm not thinking clearly . Because instead of begging her right then and there to spend the rest of her life with me , and to forget about that faggot Richard with his fancy Ph.D . from Yale and his unappreciative jones , I say : <p> Is it true ? <p> And she says : what ? <p> The thing I heard . The thing , in college , with the banana . <p> And the next thing I know , she 's the color of sand , and she 's pulling her clothes on and telling me to get out of her house . What ? What did I say ? I 'm saying . And : I heard a lot of stupid rumors in college not just about you but about other people too . Only she cuts me off and tells me that she never ever wants to see or hear from me again . Never . Not ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down on the floor , begging her to relent , begging her to let me stay , let me hold her and make it up to her-whatever she did or did n't do , I do n't care-and I 'm spewing out all these words and in the middle of them I kind of throw in that I 'm engaged to be married but it 's all over now I 've only loved her all this time I 've been fooling myself I 'm going to cut off my engagement and so forth and so on until she says , in this very quiet voice : <p> You 're engaged ? <p> Well . Yes . Sort of . <p> You never told me . <p> I 'm telling you now . <p> Goodbye , she says . <p> And for the next several days and weeks , every time I called , she hung up , and on the two or three occasions I showed up at her office , the receptionist would n't let me back . You do n't have an appointment , she said . Sorry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying : what about Robin ? You did , as gently as possible , break things off with her , did you not ? I mean , that would have been the only decent thing to do , given that you were in love with another woman , right ? Well , the answer is : yes and no . I told her I was having second thoughts , and she said : I understand . And I told her that I was going through a bad time , trying to figure out what I really wanted in life-told her I was burned-out at work ( true ) , and pulled in too many directions the rest of the time ( not precisely true ) , and some other junk , too . And she said : I understand . And then , because Robin was so good and I felt so guilty , I told her that I 'd met another girl but that nothing had happened ( false ) and that nothing would happen ( true ) . And she said : what girl ? And I gave her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , only she was married . And Robin sat there in her tiny living room-on the dumpy light-blue loveseat that she 'd reupholstered herself at night and on weekends-and cried . Then I started to see a therapist and then she started to see a therapist and slowly , slowly we got it back togetherand bit by bit I was beginning to feel like I had blood in my veins instead of dead insect parts , and so we got re-engaged , and set a date , and chose china . <p> The night before our wedding , the guys give me a bachelor party which was just about the last thing in the world I wanted . Suffice it to say that the girl they got to perform performed a few unnatural acts but nothing to compare with the millions of times I 'd imagined Emily with the banana , and when I got home that night-I was still living in the same studio on East Thirty-sixth Street that I got when I finished law school-I called Emily and I said : <p> I 'm getting married tomorrow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : do n't hang up . <p> And she said : why ? <p> And I said : because I do n't want you to think I 'm some kind of pathetic schmuck , but before I do this , I just want to make sure . Because if you 're still not married or involved or whatever , I would like you to marry me . <p> You 're crazy . <p> I 'm serious . What do you think ? <p> Sounds good . <p> Do you mean it ? <p> Sure I mean it . <p> And this part gets extremely complicated , so I 'll cut it short . I got a taxi to Robin 's parents ' house in Jamaica Estates , where Robin was spending the night , and told her , and I kept expecting her to slug me or cry or yell , but she just stood there , staring at me . Then I took the same taxi all the way back to Manhattan , to Emily 's building on the West Side . <p> What ? her voice on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hank . Let me in . <p> Then , while I 'm waiting to hear the buzz and the click to let me in , there 's this pause , and then her voice saying : <p> I thought I made it very clear that I never want to see you again as long as I live . <p> You said you 'd marry me . <p> A joke , she says . <p> Oh Jesus , I 'm saying . Oh Jesus . <p> Grow up , she says . <p> What I told my sister , because it 's true , is that it was n't the banana . It was Emily , all of Emily , her blood and her guts and her bones . I said that she was n't just an excuse to get out of a marriage I was n't really sure I wanted . I said that I knew that what I 'd done was unforgivable . What do you want me to do , castrate myself ? <p> That would be too good for you , she says . <p> What should I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me and shakes her head . <p> Author Affiliation
