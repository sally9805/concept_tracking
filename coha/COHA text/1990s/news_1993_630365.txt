<p> We had a good laugh over the bumper sticker that read , " Surf West Virginia , " remarking that it was just one of those silly signs you see , like " Ski Florida " or " Dive Wyoming . " The next day , we went surfing  --  in landlocked West Virginia . <p> Surfing , let it be explained , is a term of art in the sport of whitewater rafting , where you deliberately maneuver your raft into the roughest part of a river rapids and then let the boiling current lock you in place for the wettest ride you ever had . Sometimes another raft has to throw you a line and haul you out . It 's the part of rafting you 'll remember long after the memory of heat and horseflies has faded away . <p> Whitewater rafting , somebody once remarked , is very much like the classic description of aviation : hours of boredom interspersed with moments of sheer terror . Actually , floating down a raftable river is neither boring nor terrifying , but it does have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  except , of course , in a kayak . <p> The best whitewater rafting east of the Rockies is in West Virginia , with a little slopping over into western Maryland and southwestern Pennsylvania . For a mini-vacation from our home in the far-out suburbs of Washington , D.C. , we chose the lower New River some 60 miles east of West Virginia 's capital , Charleston . <p> Whatever else may be said of the Mountain State  --  " third world , " " underdeveloped , " " poverty-stricken "  --  it takes tourism seriously and manages to reap big returns from its concern for the recreation-seeking visitor . The state-regulated effort to make whitewater rafting both attractive and safe is one of the jewels in West Virginia 's tourism crown . <p> The misnamed New River  --  geologically one of the oldest streams in the Western Hemisphere  --  is carefully monitored by state and federal authorities . The New River gorge  --  running through south-central West Virginia from Interstate 64 to U.S. 60  --  is a national park policed by Smokey the Bear rangers . The companies ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are licensed and supervised by the state , which discourages fly-by-night operators and enforces rigid safety standards . <p> A ride down the New is , in a subtle sort of way , an ego trip . In your heart , you know the ride is not really dangerous ( though it can be ! ) , yet just before and just after each of those " moments of terror , " you ca n't help feeling like Lewis and Clark shooting the Snake River enroute to the Pacific Northwest . <p> A typical New River raft is an elongated rubber doughnut 12 to 18 feet long and perhaps 6 feet wide , divided crosswise by three or four bulkheads to give it solidity in the roughest water . For their size , the rafts are amazingly light ; at the end of the trip , four people can easily lift one over their heads and carry it from the river up to a waiting flatbed truck . <p> West Virginia raft trips can be as long as two days or as short as two hours , and can offer gentle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to people 14 years of age and older . ( There is no upper limit on age , and plenty of people closer to 100 than to 50 make the latter journey without difficulty . ) <p> Probably the most popular trip  --  and the one we took with North American River Runners on this , our latest New River adventure  --  is about six hours long , involving a nine-mile float on the river with perhaps a dozen rapids of varying severity , lots of opportunities to float solo alongside the raft rather than in it , and a midday picnic lunch ashore . <p> This trip , operated daily from April through October , costs from $ 57 a person on weekdays to $ 65 on Sundays and $ 80 on Saturdays , plus West Virginia 's 6 percent tax . Rates may vary from one outfitter to another , but not by much . <p> Our trip started ( nominally ) at 8:30 a.m. with check-in at the outfitter 's headquarters , followed by issue of individual equipment  --  a broad-bladed paddle , a life vest and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Vests are absolute musts for all rafters while on the river , and helmets are required while approaching and running rapids . <p> Several raftloads make up one outfitter 's trip ; ours had 15 passengers in three rafts ( four each in two small rafts and seven in a somewhat larger one ) , plus a guide in each . One guide ( on our trip , a 6-foot-4 giant named Tiny ) was flotilla commander , while Brant , a medium-sized man bossed a second raft , and Chris , a 100-pound university coed , skippered ours . <p> Tiny gave an equipment briefing while paddles , vests and helmets were passed out , and then talked strategy and safety during a 40-minute bus ride to the riverside launch area . Words about tactics of running individual rapids would come later . <p> My wife , Judy , a young Canadian couple named Angela and Eric , and I made up the crew of Chris 's raft . This slight young woman , who is studying for a career in resource management , quickly won our hearts with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ galley master without a whip , we who served as her galley slaves jokingly called her . <p> Several outfitters had flotillas on the river on this not-very-busy Thursday , so there were plenty of " do " and " do n't " examples for Chris to use in briefing us for what lay ahead . <p> It soon became clear that Chris was using Psychology 101 to keep her crew alert and happy . As the roar of an approaching rapids grew in intensity and the current began to pick up speed , she would point to a raft already entering the white water , describe what lay right ahead of it , and then explain the right way and the wrong way of shooting it  --  with graphic stress on the consequences of doing it wrong . She 'd add instructions on what to do should you " become a swimmer " ( euphemism for being tossed out ) . <p> Then would came the moment of truth : the indescribable bump and wrench of raft bouncing off rocks , Chris shouting , " Forward ! Forward ! . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break ! " as water streamed over the gunwales and the raft seemed ready to overturn . <p> Then , all too soon for her psyched-up crew , the rough ride would be over , with Chris praising us for a wonderful ride through perilous shoals  --  the Psych 101 equivalent , we soon realized , of saying , " Good boooy ! " to a dog that fetches a stick on command . <p> We knew we were being had , but we loved it . And , after we floated calmly out of the last rapids and under the magnificent truss bridge , 876 feet high , that carries U.S. 19 across the New River gorge , we knew we had to do it again soon . It would perhaps be on the New once more , but more likely on the nearby Gawley River or the Cheat River farther north in West Virginia , or perhaps the shorter but wilder Upper Youghiogheny in western Maryland . <p> William Hines , retired Washington bureau chief of the Chicago Sun-Times , also reviews books regularly for the newspaper . @x @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about American life by Justin Webb , a British journalist who actually lives here ( " Finally , A Brit Who Gets It , " by Joseph A. Harriss , " TAS , February 2009 ) . The title of the book is Have a Nice Day , and your columnist asserted that the author " gets it , " and not only gets it , is actually willing to admit , even to other Europeans , that under certain circumstances , Americans might not be absolutely awful . I 've spent years in Europe , on the economy , and I especially know my Brits , and I had to physically thrust down my incredulity . I simply could n't wait for the book to come out in the States , but scrambled to order it from my favorite London bookseller . I might have known : disappointment ! And it did n't help that I could predict Webb 's politics within the first couple of pages .

But ! Where another might snarl about American coarseness and stupidity and simply radiate loathing , Webb grants that yes , they are coarse and certainly stupid ; however ( one can imagine his embarrassed smile ) , they ca n't help it ! With his broader , yet indulgent , European outlook , he takes the role of a good father toward someone else 's unruly children . Is there a criminal in Arkansas who , grasping the import of Christianity , has taken steps to change his life ? Why , how nice . Naturally , the great Richard Dawkins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but still , how nice . One could point out that the great Richard Dawkins , under questioning by our own Ben Stein , was forced to grant that , okay , living systems might have been designed by an intelligent agent- just not by God , that 's all ! - but Webb would not believe it . With his own eardrums he could hear Dawkins saying it on Ben Stein 's DVD ; he still would n't believe it . The notion that a doltish lout like , say , an Iowa wheat farmer might actually have been to , say , Paris , more than once , understood what he saw perfectly well , and been ironically amused and saddened by it would not enter his darkest dream . No one , certainly not the Americans , and a thousand times not the Texans , understands how the Texas primary system works .

Newfield , New Jersey The New Is Old Again Flattered as I am that Roger Scruton mentioned New Humanist , the magazine I edit , in his piece on the New Humanism ( TAS , March 2009 ) - any publicity- I feel I should correct his misapprehension regarding the new humanist movement he claims to describe . He describes New Humanist as being part of a novel , self-conscious movement- analogous to Blair 's NewLabour- with our own " sages " and campaigns and a perspective on humanism that diverges from the worthy " old " humanism of his own parents . Perhaps it would be good if this were the case , if we were a movement as new , unified , and well-organized as Scruton implies , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a journal that has been published continually , in one form or another , for 120 years . It started life as Watt 's Literary Guide- a catalogue of the secular books published by one freethinking Fleet Street publisher , then morphed into Watt 's Literary Guide and Rational Review , then in mid-20th century was renamed The Humanist , and in the sixties the " new " was added . Though I might flatter myself that in recent years we have achieved a degree of prominence which might lead some to think that we really are new on the scene , we were actually around before Roger 's folks discovered their humanism . What is new is the reemergence of particularly virulent forms of religious fundamentalism and intolerance in recent years- from creationism retooled as Intelligent Design , to Jihadi violence , to state-enforced religious intolerance from Iran to Nigeria and Russia- which has convinced secularists that we need to have a stronger voice in the public sphere , and diversify our tactics somewhat so as to meet the challenge laid down by so many shrill dogmatists . That Scruton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I suppose , a measure of our success . But lumping together the various organizations and many different people speaking up for secularism and the humanist world view has some clear disadvantages too . Scruton uses the example of one particular ad campaign on a bus to paint us all as trivial hedonists who are uninterested in " man as an ideal , " faith , hope , charity , belief , or how to improve the world . He is absolutely right that we can be light-hearted ( the bus campaign was successful precisely because the message was so simple and uplifting ) and scathing- our God Trumps parody card game mines religious beliefs for laughs- but we also devote a lot of space in New Humanist to serious critical analysis of ideas ( those of our " sages " like Richard Dawkins as well as of believers ) , exploration of scientific and artistic endeavor , and discussions of what makes a sound secular basis for moral judgments and the good life . ( Our wide range of contributors includes many of the world 's leading thinkers on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heelas , A.C. Grayling , and Conor Gearty . ) During my tenure as editor I have published articles on all these issues as well as appreciations of , for example , Goethe , Mozart , and Francis Bacon as well as photographers , film makers , and musicians who cast light on the human condition and provide stirring examples of human achievement . In addition to supporting this wideranging human-centered content , readers of New Humanist have recently raised over 25,000 to support a secular school in rural Uganda- proving , I would argue , that we are not the hedonist nihilists Scruton paints us . It is true that we are all wary of dogma , that it is harder for us to articulate what we collectively believe in than what we are not prepared to believe ( we are after all advocates of free thinking ) , but trying to define that difficult bit- the shared values that underpin our common inheritance and destiny- is part of the fun , and what New Humanist seeks in its small way to do . CASPAR MELVILLE Editor , New Humanist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Humanism is spot on , but he 'll find no correction in the old humanism- merely the first crucial steps toward the New Humanism . Mr. Scruton strikes the right note when he calls the old humanism of his parents " a rearguard action on behalf of religious values . " Indeed , at least his parents ' generation of humanists knew what they had put at stake . The struggle that remains with the Christian faithful today , however , is not just against the hedonism of the New Humanism but also against the moralism of the old humanism . This struggle is central to Christ 's parable of the prodigal son . The hedonist prodigal seeks a life on his own terms without the father , but eventually moves toward an understanding of ultimate happiness in the father 's ( God 's ) kiss . But the one who is most at risk in this story is the elder brother , who lives as an old humanist in complete obedience to the father , unaware that what motivates his commitment to proper living are the same rewards and drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother . No doubt England would enjoy better living if everyone could maintain an elder brother 's commitment to decorum , but the old humanism and the New Humanism are little more than way stations along the same road of where England is today . J. DOUGLAS JOHNSON Chicago , Illinois Roger Scruton is of course right about the humanism he knew from his parents , which sought to raise man rather than denigrate God , but that was in a different England . Now it faces the leveling of socialist education , the stridency of Islamists and Christian evangelists and the ghetto-making dogma of multiculturalism , all directly attacking Englishness : if it remained quiet and decent , humanism might simply evaporate ( like queuing and politeness have ) . Its fight might be badly phrased at times , like the bus slogan about enjoying life ( instead of perhaps " be good for the sake of goodness " ) , but the fight was brought to us .
