TERESA ROSS was 44 when she learned she had breast cancer . " When my doctor told me , " recalls the Washington , D.C. , mother , " I lost complete control of myself . I did n't just cry ; I became hysterical . Part of it was fear and part of it was shock . I 'd never given breast cancer a second thought . " Like the majority of Black women her age , until Ross was diagnosed with the disease three years ago , she had never had a mammogram , a low-dose X-ray of the breast that accurately diagnoses 90% of breast cancers . " The only reason I had the mammogram is because my doctor insisted , " says Ross , a program analyst for the federal government who underwent a lumpectomy followed by radiation therapy and is now cancer free . " It was a real wake-up call . Now , I tell everyone how important early detection is . " Crucial would be more accurate . As any doctor will tell you , early detection saves the lives of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NCI ) , the five-year survival rate for women whose tumors have n't spread beyond the breast is a whopping 92% . Even if the cancer has spread axillary ( underarm ) lymph nodes , the five-year survival rate is still high  --  71% . It drops to 19% , however if the cancer has spread to distant sites in the body like the liver , brain or lungs . For Black women , these statistics have life and death significance . Literally . For one thing , breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death for African-American women . for another , Black women develop the disease at a younger age than White women . And , though White women are more likely than Black women to get breast cancer , Black women are more likely to die from it . ( Since 1974 , the NCI says , breast cancer deaths among Blacks have increased 13% , though they have decreased 11% among Whites . ) What 's behind these chilling statistics ? Why do more Whites survive the disease than Blacks ? Why are Black women now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why do more of us die of this disease than any other race ? How do we explain why breast cancer deaths among Black women are rising when they are falling among White women ? While several recent studies suggest that breast cancer might appear in a more deadly from among Black women , doctors and patients agree that the major reason was summed up by Morehouse Medical School President Dr. Louis Sullivan while he was secretary of Health and Human Services . " Minority women , " said Sullivan , " particularly Black women , do not have sufficient access to breast cancer information or screening facilities . " Zora Kramer Brown , 44 , a breast cancer survivor who discovered her cancer in 1981 through a routine self-exam , agrees . But , says Brown , the disparity is n't solely the result of lack of early detection and early care . " We do n't have enough clinical trial research on African-American women to understand the biology of the disease as it affects us , " says Brown , who founded and chairs the Breast Cancer Resource Committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cutting in half the number of African-Americans who die from breast cancer by the year 2000 . What we do know , however , " is that we get breast cancer at an earlier age and we 're diagnosed with it at a later stage , " says Brown , whose great grandmother , grandmother , mother and three sisters were all diagnosed with the disease . If , as Brown and many other contend , the medical profession 's understanding of breast cancer in Black women is in its early stages , how are they supposed to determine , let alone lower , their risk of developing it ? With a cure for breast cancer in the near future unforeseen , experts agree there is only one answer : " Black women must educate themselves with the vast amount of information that is available , " says Dr. Edwin T. Johnson , a board certified general surgeon and director of the Montgomery Urgent Care and Diagnostic Center in Montgomery , Ala. , whose new book , Breast Cancer/Black Woman , is designed to help African-American women survive the disease . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a one in eight chance of developing breast cancer at some point in her lifetime . However , this risk does not remain constant over the course of a woman 's life . Rather , breast cancer incidence increases with age , rising sharply after 40 . The odds that , say , a 25-year-old woman will get breast cancer is one in more than 20,000 . At 40 , however , it 's about one in 1,000 ; if she lives to be 85 , it is one in nine . Experts have also identified certain breast cancer risk factors , many of which are outside a woman 's control . But , even when a woman has no risk factors , experts warn she is not immune . " I tell women if you have breasts , you 're at risk for breast cancer , " says Zora Kramer Brown . That said , researchers have found a woman 's risk increases if : * She has a family history of breast cancer : If your mother or sister had the disease your risk is about two times higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease before menopause and/or had it in both breasts . At the same time , more than 80% of all women diagnosed with the disease have no family history of the illness . * She started menstruation early and/or reaches menopause late : Women who started their period before age 12 are 20% more likely to develop breast cancer than women who were 14 or older at first menstruation . Similarly , reaching menopause at age 55 or older doubles your risk . * She has children after 30 or she has never had children : As with early menstruation and late menopause , researchers say delayed childbearing increases your risk because it correlates with higher levels of circulating estrogen , the female hormone , which has been known to promote the growth of breast tumors . New research also has identified a host of other possible risk factors . A link between oral contraceptives , estrogen replacement therapy , obesity and abortion is suspected by some scientists but has not been proven . Some studies also have suggested that women who consume at least two alcoholic drinks a day or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even if you do n't have a single risk factor , however , experts stress every woman is at risk . Consequently , they say , all women should do monthly breast self-exams once they reach the age of 20 and have their breasts examined by a doctor every year . WHAT IF YOU FIND A LUMP ? Most breast cancers are detected by women themselves through self-examination . If you find a lump , do n't panic . Experts say about 80% of breast lumps are benign ( not cancerous ) . Many are cysts ( a benign fluid-filled sac ) which , if necessary , your doctor can often aspirate ( draw the fluid out with a needle ) right in the office . Since it is difficult to differentiate between cancerous and non-cancerous lumps , if a woman notices a lump or other change in her breast , experts say she should see a doctor right away . He or she will likely order a mammogram . The NCI recommends that mammograms be administered only by registered technologists trained to position the breast properly between the plates of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 , 1994 , requires all mammography facilities to be certified by the Food and Drug Administration . ( To ensure a facility 's X-ray equipment is accredited by the American College of Radiology and FDA-certified , call the American Cancer Society at 800/ACS-2345 . Single copies of A Woman 's Guide to Quality Mammo-grams are also available free of charge from the Public Health Service by calling 800/358-9295 . ) If the mammogram shows anything suspicious , the next step probably will be a biopsy , the removal of a small piece of tissue to find out if a lump is cancerous . WHAT IF IT IS CANCER ? This year , there will be about 182,000 new cases of breast cancer among women , according to government statistics . If you are diagnosed with the disease , you have two basic treatment options : 1 ) lumpectomy ( removal of the tumor and some surrounding tissue ) followed by radiation therapy ; and 2 ) mastectomy b ( removal of the breast ) . More than 75 percent of women with newly discovered breast cancers have tumors small enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates are equal for lumpectomy and mastectomy  --  as high as 93% five years after diagnosis if the cancer is detected early . Since lumpectomy is the removal of the cancerous lump , not the whole breast , it is a far less extensive procedure than mastectomy . " That 's why it 's so important for Black women to be told all of their options before they make a treatment decision , " says Dr. Lori Pierce , an African-American radiation oncologist and assistant professor at the University of Michigan who studied Black women with early-stage breast cancer and found that lumpectomy and radiation were just as successful in preventing the return of breast cancer as it has been shown to be in White women . Following lumpectomy , radiation is given to the affected breast and may also be given to nearby lymph nodes . Each treatment takes only a few minutes and is painless . Treatments are usually given on a daily basis for five to seven weeks . In the past , a biopsy was combined with immediate surgery if cancer was found . Now , experts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with family , friends and health professionals so that they choose the treatment option that is right for them . Dr. Edwin Johnson says most experts feel that it is adequate to treat the cancer within a few weeks . WHO SHOULD HAVE A MAMMOGRAM AND WHEN ? While experts disagree about what age women should begin regular-screening mammograms , everyone agrees they can detect tumors years earlier than is possible by physical exam . The American Cancer Society urges women to have a mammogram yearly or every other year starting at age 40 , and annual breast X-rays after 50 . However , because Black women under 40 are more likely to develop breast cancer than White women under 40 , many Black doctors believe Black women should begin regular screening mammograms at an earlier age . " Like the National Medical Association , I recommend that Black women have a baseline mammogram at age 35 and annual mammograms beginning at age 40 , " say Dr. Elizabeth A. Patterson , a University of Pennsylvania Hospital mammographer . Dr. Rogsbert Phillips , a general surgeon in Atlanta with a sub-specialty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who are completely asymptomatic , should have a mammogram yearly or every other year beginning at age 35 .
