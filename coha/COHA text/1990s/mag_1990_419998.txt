Section : NATIONAL AFFAIRS TABLE <p> A man who enjoys the pleasure of his own company , David H. Souter sat alone last Monday in an office in the basement of the White House . It was a moment to reflect after a breathtaking 24 hours . On Sunday , he had been working quietly in his judicial chambers in Boston when the president 's counsel C. Boyden Gray called and invited him to Washington . U.S. Supreme Court Justice William Brennan had resigned and George Bush wanted to talk with Souter about replacing him . Before Souter could enter the presidential study , though , he had to run the gantlet of Victorian Washington . No , he assured White House aides , he had never used drugs . And no , the 50-year-old bachelor said , he was not a homosexual . For an intensely private man like Souter , it was a relief finally to see Bush himself ; their 40 minutes went well , two sons of New England who spoke to each other in moderate , reassuring tones . <p> Then he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was rattling his carefully ordered life . A New Hampshire Supreme Court judge for seven years , Souter had been named to the U.S. Court of Appeals just three months earlier . He still had n't unpacked all his books and now he was on the verge of another move . He was , White House staffers said , in a " daze . " In a moment of doubt , he asked his friend and mentor New Hampshire Sen. Warren Rudman , " Why would the president want me ? " <p> Two floors up , another candidate was waiting , U.S. Circuit Court Judge Edith Jones of Texas . Her 30 minutes with Bush had been a lovefest of Lone Star comradery . And her resume was pure Tory : an early Reaganite , thought to be a steadfast abortion foe , and her parents had a place in Kennebunkport , too . <p> So , would it be the Lady or the Yankee ? <p> For 45 minutes Bush listened to his advisers . Vice President Dan Quayle and chief of staff John Sununu argued for Jones . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's anxious right flank and a sure vote to overturn Roe v. Wade , the 1973 landmark decision which read the right to choose an abortion into the U.S. Constitution . Attorney General Richard Thornburgh and presidential counsel Gray pressed Souter 's case . He was smart  --  Harvard , Phi Beta Kappa , a Rhodes scholar  --  conservative , and , best of all , virtually unknown . A man without tracks could n't be hunted down by Senate Democrats . <p> Bush retreated to his hideaway off the Oval Office for an hour 's thought . As he pondered , he wrote a memo , laying out the strengths of each candidate . In characteristic prose , he explained his decision : " I have pledged excellence , strict construction . Souter is most impressive here . I liked his manner  --  scholarly , serious approach  --  right age  --  temperament = A OK . " <p> It was a historic moment for Bush and the Supreme Court . After four appointments by Ronald Reagan , the high court has been on the brink of having its first reliable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the 84-year-old keeper of the court 's liberal flame , gave Bush an opportunity to fundamentally shift the jurisprudential balance of power into the next century . Nowhere was that clearer than on the abortion issue . Four justices already seem prepared to rewrite or even erase the constitutional protection accorded women seeking to end their pregnancies . Bush had campaigned on a pro-life platform and his anti-abortion supporters expected a sympathetic appointment . But nominating an open and ardent abortion foe would infuriate  --  and energize  --  liberal groups and invite a prolonged battle in the U.S. Senate , which must pass on all court nominations . Naming Souter was a bid to avoid a bloody struggle . " He was the perfect candidate , " says one Bush aide . " No footprints , no fight . " <p> Tapping a man without a shadow left friend and foe alike in a quandary ( following story ) . Liberal interest groups were willing to fight but thus far did n't have a target to aim at . In the Senate , the advent of Souter set off a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consent . Could the Senate insist that Souter explain his positions on controversial topics ? <p> Local pride : And anti-abortion forces were discomfited , too . If Bush was telling the truth  --  he insisted that neither he nor his aides had interrogated Souter about his views  --  why should abortion foes assume he was an ally ? To mollify them , Sununu , an unblemished right-to-lifer and former governor of New Hampshire , vouched for the nominee . The message : if Souter was good enough for Sununu , then he must be A-OK on abortion . <p> For Souter , the attention was a bit much . " I must say , I never thought of myself as that obscure , " he said . Indeed , in his part of the New Hampshire outback , Souter has been a source of local pride for decades . His family moved to tiny Weare ( population : 3,232 ) when he was 11 , and , except for schooling , he never left . In high school , Souter was the shy , brainy boy always seen carrying his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " recalls classmate Marcia Palmater . " He may have found that painful but he would n't have shown it . " By his senior year , he was president of the National Honor Society , most likely to succeed and coeditor of the yearbook . In the latter capacity he apparently allowed a head shot of himself to be stuck on the body of a cave man dragging the " most sophisticated " schoolgirl by her hair , as well as the uncharacteristic entry under his name : " enjoys giving and attending scandalous parties . " <p> Fun and refreshing : As a Harvard undergraduate he majored in philosophy , did volunteer work through Phillips Brooks House and wrote his senior honors thesis on aspects of Oliver Wendell Holmes 's legal thought . At Oxford , while his fellow Rhodes scholars headed off to explore Europe , he stayed behind to study . He returned to Harvard for law school and did well though failed to make Law Review . " He was a fun and refreshing person , " recalls classmate Jonathan Roosevelt . " He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> The adult Souter came to embody traditional Yankee virtues . He 's loyal : he lived with his widowed mother until she moved to a retirement community . He 's frugal : he has a net worth of $621,252.41 but his house needs a paint job , badly . He 's religious : a high-church Episcopalian who attends services regularly . He 's not a glutton : he takes his liquor watered and eats cottage cheese for lunch . He 's reticent : neighbors say that some nights Souter wo n't answer his phone . <p> And he loves the law . After a short stint with a private Concord law firm , he joined the state attorney general 's office . After eight years , he became A.G. himself . In that role he unsuccessfully defended Gov . Meldrim Thomson 's desire to fly the American flag at halfmast on Good Friday , and also sought to jail protesters at the Seabrook nuclear power plant . But by most accounts , he ran a respectable , meticulous office and was rewarded with a judgeship . <p> His private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to manage " the lifestyle issue . " His friend Rudman assured a GOP Senate caucus meeting that the nominee was " a very normal guy , " who had been a disappointed Souter in two heterosexual relationships . Journalists found two women he had dated in the ' 60s and ' 70s , who rated him " very warm friendly " and " a real gentleman . " Perhaps more telling , a gay New Hampshire lawyer who spoke on condition of anonymity says there is " not a particle of evidence " to suggest Souter is homosexual . Friends say that his only mistress is the law . " I think he gets lonely sometimes , " says lawyer Tom Rath . " I think his work has been a tremendous release in that regard . " <p> So this much is clear : if he gets to Washington , Souter will be at the top of every matchmaker 's most eligible list . But what sort of justice will he be ? That 's far less certain . His record suggests that he sees the judiciary as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposed a law which would have required minors seeking abortions to either get permission from their parents or from judges . Souter argued successfully that the provision would leave judges without rules to apply ; instead they would be forced into " acts of unfettered personal choice . " As a state Supreme Court judge he joined an opinion which found constitutional a state law that barred gays from serving as foster parents . The court was n't agreeing with the value judgment , merely holding that the legislature had the power to make one . <p> An exception : On criminal-law issues , as an appellate judge he has tended not to reverse convictions . The one much-discussed exception to that tendency involved Souter 's interpretation of a statute that bars the use of evidence of " prior sexual activity " between an alleged rape victim and anyone but the defendant . In 1988 he created an exception to that law when there was evidence of the victim 's " publicly inviting acts " shortly before the alleged crime . At a second trial , the rapist was convicted again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the one hand , Souter served as a trustee of Concord Hospital where abortions are performed , and there is no record of his objecting . Also , he has shown a healthy respect for the past decisions of courts . But , on the other hand , in a case interpreting the state constitution he held that " the language ... is to be understood in the sense in which it was used at the time of its adoption . " That is a very narrow standard , one in conflict with Roe v. Wade as well as much of the modern Supreme Court 's legacy . <p> The confirmation hearings chaired by Sen. Joseph Biden , are now scheduled to begin in September . Until then , Senate staffers will comb through Judge Souter 's past , interest groups will test the waters and the White House will continue its selling job . And Souter can resume his normal life , sitting quietly at home in Weare studying and thinking , surrounded by the books and papers he loves . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Smart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( COLOR ) : The road to confirmation : Judiciary Committee chairman Biden <p> ARIC PRESS with THOMAS M.
