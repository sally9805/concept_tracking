After their mothers death , they had a terrible fight . Would they ever find a way to forgive each other or themselves ? <p> Do n't bother your mother . She 's not feeling well . " Dan 's voice penetrates my foggy brain like a disembodied spirit I hear Junie 's whiny reply : " But yoo put tnx much mayonnaise on my sandwich ! " " Eat it anyway , " Dan says . Score one for Dan , I think , and turn over in bed . Muscles scream in protest ; even my hair hurts . The bedroom door opens , and Dan stops to kiss me goodbye . " Jared left early for practice . I made Junie 's lunch , " he says proudly . Then he sighs . " Why do n't you let me call your sister ? " Standing above me with his back to the window , Dan seems to glow , a lanky angel in a suit . " Forget it , " I say . " I 've told you . I 'm never going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Have it your way . I 'll call around noon . " I wait until I hear his car leave the driveway , then stare morosely at the phone . Nly sister , Delores , a marketing consultant for a cosmetics firm , travels 80 percent of the year . When she 's home , she works out of her apartment in the next town . I know she 's home now because Dan bumped into her last night at the supermarket . " Delores just got back from Paris , " he told me when he came home . " She asked how you were . I said you were laid up with the flu . " " Why did you tell her I was sick ? " " Because you are , " hc said , with maddening male logic . " She asked if there was anything she could do . I told her I did n't think so . " He had that right . There is nothing Delores can ever do to make up for the things she said last November , after our mother died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I WOULD HAVE NOTICED that she was getting worse ! Why did n't you do something ? " Delores and I were strolling on the beach , deserted except for an elderly woman and her dog by the water 's edge . " I did what I could , " I told chest X ray . " " Which he never did ! You should have followed through ! " I stopped and looked at her . Delores was just four years younger than I , but her skillful use of makeup made her appear more like my teenage daughter . " I'hat week , however , when mirrors were covered in deference to the departed , Delores had to do without makeup , and her hair was limp . I noticed the little lines bracketing her eyes . She was 35 , and for once , she Iooked it . " Are you suggesting I 'm to blame for Slom 's death ? " I asked , incredulous . She looked at me coldly . " I 'm suggesting that you could have taken the time to- " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and began walking again . " When I called you before I left and told you to set up a meeting with the doctor , you said you did n't have time ! " " Well , I did n't ! " I turned , indignant . " I had four closings that week . I spoke to the doctor on the phone and I thought that was enough ... " My voice trailed off , and Iooked away . ( continued ) " Oh , please , you never had enough time for iom ! " I could feel tears building , but I was determined not to give in . " Well , I was the one with her when she died , while you were off in Copenhagen- " " And if I 'd been here , she 'd probably still be alive ! " Delores shouted . The woman at the water 's edge was staring at us openly . She appeared to te in her late 60s , my mother 's age . I thought how much my mother would have enjoyed such a day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No longer able to control tears , I soled , " Well , at least I gave N lome something to be proud off I gave her grandchildren ! " Delores recoiled . " ' IThat 's it . I 'm going home ! " She stalked off ahead of me , and we walked the rest of the way in a silence that stretched from that day to this . . . THE PHONE RINGS , IT IS NINA , MY BOSS AT the real estate agency , wanting to know when I 'll be back . " I 'm feeling lbtter , " I lie . " Probably by the end of the week , " I tell her . " No sooner ? " she asks . " Because things are really hopping around here , " I remind myself that we need the money my job brings in , and that telling Nina to get a life would probably not be wise . " I 'll try , " I say . When I hang up , I realize I 'm disappointed that it was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told everyone I have no intention of speaking to my sister again . My friends have tried to be loyal , yet fair . " It was a dumb thing for Delores to say , " they all agree , " but you were both overwrought . " Perhaps , but there are limits to what may be said in anger , and blaming me for our mother 's death qualifies as crossing the line . Pride is n't without consequences , however , for I have suffered a double loss . Now I have no one with whom to share memo rics of our mother , except in dreams . And in my dreams , Delores and I are children again , playing in our backyard . We push our dog , Rusty , in a doll carriage ; we aim for the sky on our swings while our mother smiles at us from her garden : " I love you ! " she calls to us from among the peonies . I STAND UP AND WHEN THE ROOM STOPS spinnling , make my way over to the bathroom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 've read a lot of books with the word light in the title , books about peopIe who 've come close to dying and lived to tell about it I find them very comforting . " Death ends nothing , " the survivors insist . " ' Ihose who have gone on to the other side often come back to reassure the ones they left behind . Be open to them .... " I try like crazy to Inc open . In bed at night , my eyes search the darkness for ct glimpse of ghostly reassurance . But my mother has yet to appear . I believe this is because she is angry because I did n't , as Delores accused , follow up on the chest X raY . Delores , I berate myself , would have badgered the doctor to do the X ray , enabling him to spot the pneumonia that was to kill our mother within a week . THE SIGHT OF MYSELF FRIGHTENING . " Tea , " I whisper to the red-eyed creature who stares at me from the medicine cabinet mirror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better . " A few weeks in the Bahamas would n't hurt , either , I think , as I survey the kitchen : breakfast dishes piled on the counter ; milk and juice cartons open on the table . I put on the kettle and try not to worry that Jared has forgotten his lunch . He 's 12 , and would rather starve than have his mother show up at school with his tuna sandwich . I remember how embarrassed I felt when my mother would appear in my classroom proffering snow boots after a surprise storm . Now , the memory brings me to tears . Outside , the sky is gray and threatening . Please , no more snow , I beg silently . I look at the calendar and count : five weeks to spring . On such an unpromising day , my mother would already be kneeling in her garden , impatiently probing the hard earth with her fingers . It irked her that neither of her daughters inherited her love of gardening . " Give it a chance , girls , " she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , but the rewards are worth it . " " Not me , " I would tell her . " I prefer the dirt to stay beneath my shoes . " Dolores would add , " Besides , who wants to put so mutch effort into flowers when they just die anyway ? " " Everything dies , " my mother would reply softly . " What 's important is the beauty we bring into the world while we live . " MY NOSE IS STUFFY AND MY HEAD ACHES . I want my mother . I want her to kiss my forehead and feed me homemade chicken soup . I want her to play Chinese checkers with me , and afterward read mc a storry about dancing princesses . Come to me , I plead . Tell me that you 're in a better place . Tell me you forgive me . The tea makes me feel semihuman . For the past two days , I 've been unable to function ; now I decide to tackle some of the chaos around me . I go from room to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stagger with my brundle to the landry room . I start to load the washer when the doorbell rings . " Open up , Jen . It 's Delores , " I hear before I make it to the door . At nine-thirty in the morning , she is perfectly made up , her auburn hair cut in a sleek , new style . " You look awful , " she says . " You look great , " I acknowledge , letting her in . For an awkward moment , neither of us says a word , then we both speak at the same time : " Dan tells me you were in Paris- " " I met Dan last night at the market- " We chuckle self-consciously . There 's no denying it : I 'm glad to see her . " Dan said you had the flu . Why are n't you in bed ? " " I 've been there . For two days . " She takes a shaky breath . " Listen , I 'm really sorry , Jen . For that sniff I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was feeling guilty , I guess , for not being here when she died . I 've wanted to call you a thousand times . " " Me too , " I sigh , and we hug . In the kitchen , Delores fixes us fresh tea with honey and lemon . She makes toast and cuts the slices into triangles , the way our mother used to . We talk a long time : about our mother , and what a loving person she was ; and about our dad , who died so long ago we hardly remember him . I wonder aloud if they 're Iooking down on us as we speak , reunited at last . Delores , a professed agnostic , says that although the idea of an afterlife is appealing , she is reluctant to suspend her disbelief . When I mention the books I 've been reading , she asks if I also believe that little men with heads shaped like lightbulbs are conducting reproductive experiments on humans . " Aliens ? Who knows ? " I answer . " Give me a break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Speaking of bulbs , I 've brought some . They 're in the car . " " You brought me lightbulbs ? " " Not lightbulbs . Tulip bulbs . I bought them for blom when I was in Copenhagen . " She lowers her eyes . " I was going to give them away , but then I thought you might want them . " We both turn to the window . The gloomy morning has made my backyard distinctly uninviting . " I do n't know anything about planting tulip bulbs , " I say sorrowfully . " Neither do I. Who knows if this is even the right time of year , but I 'm willing to give it a shot . " Delores tries to persuade me to remain inside while she does the planting , but I wo n't hear of it . " I 'm feeling much better . " This is true , though I do n't know if it 's the tea or the fact that Delores and I are speaking again . " Besides , this is something we should do together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind a scarf around my neck , but the minute we step onto my back porch , the icy wind sets my head pounding again . We go to the section of yard that gets the most sun . Delores and I , each armed with a spade , drop to our knees and start to dig . Silently , diligently , we break the hard surface of the ground , depositing the bulbs into the earth . " I hope we 're doing this right , " Delores says after awhile . " I hope the silly thing grow . " " Of course they 'll grow . " Do n't ask me how , but I know they will . Smiling , I begin to understand what my mother found so irresistible : Gleaning beauty from the drab earth , season after season , in spite of the odds , is a tribute to hope . In a few weeks , I think , Delores and I will stand here together , admiring our handiwork . In the vibrant colors , the graceful stems , the fragrant perfection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and know in our hearts that she will never really leave us . WE WORK FOR ABOUT AN HOUR BEFORE I begin sneezing . Delores looks tip from her digging . " I 'm not kidding , Jen , get into the house this minute ! I 'll finish up . " So I go . From the window , I watch my sister , bent against the wind , kneeling in that pose I know so well . " I 'm exhausted , " Delores says when she finally comes in . I ask if she 'd like to stay for lunch , but she says she has to go home and change for a date with a man she met last month . " He 's very nice , " she offers shyly . " Smart and normal . I think lore would have liked him . " " Really ? That 's great , Del , " I say . " Call me later , okay ? " " Okay , " she promises . Outside , it has finally begun to snow , but lightly , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
