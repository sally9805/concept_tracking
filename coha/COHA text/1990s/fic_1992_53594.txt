THE LEAVES CRINKLING UNDERFOOT sound like a wrapper being torn from a candy bar . <p> " Be quiet , Kevin , " Roy says to his nephew . <p> " When can we stop ? " Kevin whispers . He points the way through the woods with his gun . " We ca n't find any squirrels without Hubert . We should have brought Hubert . " <p> " Shhh ! You 're squirming too much . " <p> When they left at dawn , the dog , whining in his pen , watched them leave . Roy had dreamed of the dog howling at the train , then running after it . He could not stop the dog . The dream seemed suspended , the dog forever racing after the train , Roy forever calling after him , his voice drowned out by the train whistle . Roy woke with the sure knowledge that the dog would catch the train and chase it the way he herded the cows  --  by getting in front and running sideways , just a hair ahead of them . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes trees squirrels for them . Then Roy inches around the tree and catches the squirrel looking the other way . On a recent hunting trip with his nephew , they saw something amazing : a squirrel accidentally falling out of a tree , thrashing in the leaves on the ground , and then whizzing up the tree so quickly they could n't distinguish the squirrel from the ground , the leaves , the tree . They just saw spinning action , like blurred photographs of horses racing . " It makes a squirrel awful mad to fall out of a tree , " he told Kevin . That made the little boy laugh . <p> " Is it true you 'll have to put Hubert to sleep ? " Kevin asks now . He has asked this five times . <p> " I 'm afraid so . " <p> " You do n't have to , do you ? " <p> Roy does n't answer . They have reached an overgrown graveyard at the edge of the woods near the Kentucky-Tennessee line . Vines have killed many of the trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed a thick covering over the high stumps and the graves . Roy and his brother Jim used to come here when they were kids . Once , they made a campfire at the edge of the graveyard and dared themselves to sleep there , under a homemade burlap-sack tent . Jim , who was four years younger , cried , and Roy felt brave and protective . <p> " The squirrels are hiding today , " he says to Kevin . " We 're making too much noise . " He picks up a hickory nut and shows it to Kevin . " These nuts are still too green , " he says . " A squirrel has to cut the nuts and let them dry out on the ground before he stores them . He has to time it just right . He has to have all his food for the winter stored by first frost . " <p> " Do n't they eat anything but hickory nuts ? " <p> Roy sits down on a fallen log . Nearby is a patch of young trees , wrapped by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid , that would have been a hideout for smugglers . <p> " I do n't want you to put Hubert to sleep , " Kevin says , sitting beside Roy and laying his gun parallel to the log . <p> " Well , he bit my little granddaughter and they say I have to put him to sleep . " <p> " It was her fault . She was aggravating him . " <p> " They said it was a bite , but it was really a scratch . Hubert 's big old toenails . " <p> Roy smokes a cigarette as they rest . His shotgun slants against the log , the barrel pointing down . He feels an urge to shoot into the dirt . He is thirsty and the sun is already high , splashing through the vines like spilled marbles . Yesterday Roy rigged up a pen for the dog , stringing wire around some young oak trees and fastening it onto an unused shed . He fashioned a gate out of an old set of mattress springs , using a discarded gun barrel for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barrel with baling wire . The dog jumped the fence last night , and then Roy had to tie him inside the pen with a rusty chain he found in the smokehouse . <p> " I wish the squirrels would come , " says Kevin impatiently . " We have to shoot the squirrels . They make holes in the trees , and then the trees die . " <p> " Vines kill trees too . Look at all these dead trees . " <p> " If we do n't shoot the squirrels , they 'll starve to death . " <p> " Had you rather be shot or starve to death ? " Roy asks , his smoke drifting toward the vine cave . <p> Kevin , his serious little face contemplating the question , like a bird eyeing a worm , says , " I think I 'd rather be shot . I 'd be miserable if I could n't eat . I 'm hungry . Is it almost time to go ? " <p> " We ca n't go till we get some squirrels . That was our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hidden . Some are face down , broken off and buried under the leaves . As they walk through the thicket , Roy tries to get his bearings by finding some familiar stone . He tells Kevin about a row of four children 's graves he remembers . He says , " A woman was working in the field and she left her children on a pallet . A swarm of bees come along and stung them to death . " <p> " Ooh ! " <p> " Look at this . " A gravestone is growing up through the center of a tree , in the opening at its base . The stone , a pale gray marble , peeps out . Roy can make out some dates , 1889-1916 , and the name JAMES . <p> " Twenty-seven years old , " Kevin says after a moment . " I 'm good at adding and subtracting in my head . " <p> " What else are you good at besides being quiet when you 're hunting squirrels ? " <p> " Football . I go for the knee when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " They ca n't hurt me . I 'm quick . I know how to relax when I fall down . " <p> " But patience is what counts , " Roy says . " That 's what squirrel hunting 's all about . If you ca n't wait long enough , then they outsmart you . You do n't want people to say a squirrel is smarter than you , do you ? " <p> " We need Hubert , " the boy says . <p> An acorn drops into the vines , making a soft sound , like a cow swishing its tail . The squirrel is halfway up an oak tree , frozen against a limb , beyond a cluster of leaves . But Roy can see it . The squirrel does n't move , not even a flicker of its bushy tail . It is the dull metal color of Roy 's pickup truck . In a motion that seems to take all morning , Roy aims and fires , and the squirrel whirs like an electric fan as it falls . <p> At home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling a friend about the incident with the dog . " I think Hubert was asleep and Lisa must have stepped on his foot . He had a hurt foot and she scared him . He does that with the cats . He flares up and snaps . He 's getting old , but he was always good with children . He was always loving with them . " Jewell listens a while , twisting her hair with her free hand , then goes on . " Yes , I guess we 're going to have to do something with him to keep peace in the family . Sarah 's so tore up , seeing her little girl hurt . " <p> " That stupid boy she married poisoned her mind , " Roy says . <p> " Hush . I 'm trying to talk on the phone , " Jewell says . <p> " She always loved dogs , " Roy says . " But she lets him boss her around . " <p> Jewell makes squirrel dumplings , but Roy can not eat . He picks out buckshot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , disappointed . Her frown makes dark lines form around her mouth , but she is pretty . After all these years , Roy is sometimes surprised by how much in love with her he is , how a simple little motion , like the way she carries the pot with the loose handle to the table and dishes out the stew on his plate , makes him feel a powerful surge , the way he felt in the cemetery about his past , as though there were still something about Jewell that he does not know . But he ca n't distinguish now between love and simple need . And her calmness irritates him , as though she does n't care what happens to the dog . <p> He pushes his plate away . " My stomach 's soured , " he says . <p> Roy and Kevin take scraps to Hubert , who is lying on the dirt floor of the shed . The dog , unaccustomed to being tied , does not get up . He places his head between his paws and looks ashamed . His shaggy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flecks of dirt , and a patch on his belly is thin where he has scratched at fleas . <p> " Hello , Hubert . " <p> " Hubert does n't have rabies , " says Kevin . <p> " Probably not . " <p> " Let 's turn him loose . " <p> " No . We have to keep him tied for a week . " <p> " What if he has rabies ? " <p> " Then Lisa has to have shots and they 'll cut Hubert 's head off and send it to Memphis . " At the hospital , Roy 's daughter said to him , " When you get back home , I want you to shoot that dog . " <p> " Why , I ca n't shoot Hubert ! " he said , surprised . It was the wrong thing to say , the wrong tone . <p> Sarah said , " If you do n't kill him , then Jerry will . " But the doctor told them they had to confine Hubert for a week , to observe him for signs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirt and the rusty chain rattles , a fused sound like the bees Roy heard buzzing in the cemetery , a sound that had n't registered until just now . <p> " I do n't believe you , " Kevin is saying . " You 're always making fun . This is serious . Nobody 's going to send Hubert 's head to Memphis . " <p> At the stockyard on Wednesday , when the farmers go to trade produce and livestock , Roy looks for someone he can give Hubert to . He wanders around , looking at beagles and bird dogs . He ca n't imagine Hubert in one of these cages , with strangers looking him over . No one would want Hubert , Roy tells himself . Hubert was never much of a rabbit hunter . <p> A farmer he knows speaks to him across a truck bed . " Roy , I heard your dog bit your grandbaby . " <p> " Yeah . The other day . " <p> " They said down at the filling station that the dog plumb tore her ear off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Some buddies of your son-in-law 's . They said the dog turned vicious . " <p> " Why , Hubert 's not vicious ! It was n't even a bite . He just scratched her . Right below her ear on her neck is a scratch from his big old paw . " Roy runs his hand below his ear . " He did n't even touch her ear . " <p> " They said it was a bite . " <p> " No . It was a scratch . " <p> It strikes Roy that the truth is lost . From now on , it will be a different story , the child almost killed , the ear dangling by the skin . <p> The man says , " Why , Roy , if my best horse bit my wife , or any of my children , I 'd shoot him . Your problem is , that dog got a taste of blood and he 'll do it again . That 's the way they do . " <p> Roy 's mind skips ahead : the kinfolks talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , saying that Roy loved his dog more than he loved his grandchild . He imagines the women at church gossiping about it . Jewell goes to church . She is one of those gabby women . He has never thought of her that way before . <p> Roy 's brother Jim , Kevin 's father , telephones that evening . " Listen , Roy , I 've got an idea . " <p> Jim is a hotshot lawyer . He is full of bright ideas , but Roy rarely listens to them . Jim has a brick colonial house in a subdivision and is ashamed of Roy going around in his blue jeans and feed cap . But Roy does n't have to impress anybody in town . <p> Jim does n't simply say , " I know somebody who wants a dog . " He says , " I 've got connections . " Then he talks for ten minutes about a girl he knows who works at the courthouse and needs a guard dog . <p> " I do n't know if I can give him away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And she might not take care of him . " <p> " She 's real good with animals . She 's got a bunch of cats . " <p> " What if Hubert did get the taste of blood ? He might bite her . " <p> " Oh , do n't believe that , Roy You know as well as I do that any dog that 's disturbed in his sleep will snap and growl before he thinks . Remember that time old Rube bit me ? He bit you too . Mama did n't do anything about it . She whipped us for aggravating him . It 's just stupid to punish a dog for being a dog . " <p> " Sarah wants him dead . " <p> " That wo n't solve a thing . I 've learned this in criminal law . It 's true of dogs as well as people , when you come right down to it . " <p> But Jim had n't seen the shape Sarah was in when she visited that afternoon . She had left the child with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jerry does n't want me to bring Lisa out here till you do something about that dog , " she said . " And he wo n't come out either . He 's afraid he 'll get mad and do something he 'll be sorry for . " Sarah was wearing white pedal pushers and sandals , and she was white-looking all over , as though the shock had permanently drained her blood . Jewell was so gentle with her , asking about Lisa 's stitches while Sarah ate damson pie and cried . Looking out the kitchen window , Sarah saw Kevin out by the dog pen . Kevin had a bucket filled with kittens , and he was poking them through the wire to play with Hubert . " You 're going to fool around and let that dog hurt Kevin too , " Sarah said angrily to Roy . By then , her face was red from bawling . <p> At three-thirty A.M. , Roy sits in the kitchen and smokes a cigarette and listens to an early-rising bird outside , singing a tentative song . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the train passes by , he hears Hubert 's delicate , musical howl , woo-wooing at the train . Roy has had Hubert eight years . He was a young dog when he arrived at the farm , a stray . Sarah was fifteen , and she used to take him with her after school to round up the cows . When Sarah married Jerry , she had wanted to take Hubert with her , but Jerry wanted to get a fancy dog with papers . They bought a black dog with a rust-colored face , and it got run over on the road . <p> Earlier in the summer , Roy helped Jerry build a utility room on the back of his house . He spent all week on it , even coming home at noon for dinner , but Jerry never paid him or thanked him . Instead , Jerry said , " Are n't you going to help me pen up them hogs I bought ? " Roy did n't help him . Now he feels Jerry is probably being nasty about the dog because Roy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes into the kitchen , clutching her housecoat around her . She turns up the thermostat . " I could n't sleep either , " she says , putting her hands on his shoulders from behind . " I told Sarah how this was tearing you apart , but she would n't hear me . " <p> Roy stubs out his cigarette and stands up . He walks over to the picture window and opens the drapes . The light from the kitchen reflects on the window , showing him his wife beside the refrigerator , but he can tell how dark it is outside . <p> Jewell says , " Sarah told me she took Lisa with her to see somebody about hemming a skirt yesterday and there was a dog in the yard . Little Lisa just balled up and started to shake . She said , Doggie biter Doggie bite ! ' " <p> " They 'll have her afraid of dogs the rest of her life . " <p> " Are you going to take care of Hubert or are you going to let Jerry do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I wo n't give him the satisfaction . " <p> It is too early to milk , but Roy gets into his milking clothes and waits by the picture window for first light . <p> On Thursday , Jim brings Kevin over after school to shoot at Coke cans . A girl is with them . She 's about his daughter 's age . Sarah was twenty-three on July twenty-sixth . The girl is wearing purple pants and high heels . She is there half an hour , talking to Hubert . She says she is in love with Hubert . Roy has never heard anyone say such a thing about a dog before . " It 's love at first sight , " she says , smiling at Roy . " Collies have always been my favorite . I had collies when I was little , and I grew up reading about the Sunnybank collies . I always thought collies were the sweetest-tempered dogs . " <p> " He 's not full-blooded , " Roy says . <p> " You need you a guard dog , Nancy , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snagged on the mattress springs . <p> " Hubert has such interesting eyes , " she says . " They look soulful . " <p> Roy exchanges looks with Hubert . " Good old Hubert , " he says , patting the dog 's head . <p> The girl 's pants are tight , and when she stands up , after squatting to pet the dog through the wire , she wiggles to let the wrinkles fall down her legs . She has a head of hair that would fill a bushel basket , and several bracelets that jangle , like Hubert 's chain . <p> " Good old Hubert , " Roy says , patting the dog again . He gazes across the grass , where Kevin 's Coke cans are scattered like wrecked cars in a junkyard . <p> Jim is driving Roy to Lovelacetown . Hubert is in the back seat of Roy 's Buick station wagon because the rear is filled with expensive camping equipment . Jim is taking Kevin camping in the Smokies the next weekend . When they stop for a traffic light , Hubert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sit down , Hubert , " Roy says . <p> The girl , Nancy Hall , lives thirty miles away . Roy wonders if Hubert will try to return home , the way dogs he hears about on the news often do . Roy does n't want to talk to Jim . He is afraid he will cry , and he can not bear for Jim to see him cry . <p> Jim says , " It 's her family 's old homeplace , and she 'd rather commute than move to the county seat . But it 's a lot for her to keep up . She really does need a guard dog for that old mansion . " <p> " What mansion ? Hubert 's going to a mansion ? " <p> " You remember who she is . I told you . " <p> " No , you did n't . " <p> " She 's Fenton Hall 's daughter . " <p> " Fenton Hall ? " Roy wonders if Jim 's engine is knocking , but it is his own heart pounding . Fenton Hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a plane crash while on a re-election campaign trip . Everybody in this part of Kentucky believes he would have become president eventually . A rigor runs up Roy 's spine . <p> " I did n't know that 's who she was , " he says , shivering . <p> " I told you . You just were n't paying attention . " <p> " You and your ' connections . ' I never pay attention when you brag about the big dudes you know . " But he is awed . He turns and speaks to the dog . " Hubert , you 're going to live in a mansion . " <p> " Sarah 's probably going to be put out with me for arranging this , " Jim says . " But I know how you love that dog . " <p> " Sarah 's going to murder me . " Sarah wanted to punish the dog . Instead , the dog is getting this reward . <p> The mansion is up a winding gravel road , set back in the trees . It is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is not exactly a mansion , and it looks somewhat rundown . The flowerbeds are over grown . <p> " See why she needs a guard dog ? " Jim asks . <p> Nancy is in tight blue jeans and cowboy boots , her hair tied back with a rolled red bandanna . She hugs the dog , and again she says she is in love with him . They are standing in the yard . The tall trees shroud the house . They are dangerously close , Roy thinks . Broken black limbs from the trees litter the ground , making him remember the dented Coke cans Kevin shot all over the yard . <p> " I 'm going to make you a house dog , " Nancy says to Hubert , leading him toward the door . <p> " Hubert 's never been in the house , " Roy says . <p> " I want him to sleep in my bedroom , " she says , smiling . " He can guard me . Is n't he beautiful ? Come on , Hubert . " <p> The house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sees the mahogany and silver , more fabulous antiques than he has seen at the flea markets . Some of the furniture is covered with protective fringed throws . The living room has a marble fireplace with a grandfather clock on the mantel . Roy notices a gun on the wall , a handsome old rifle trimmed with ornate brass filigree . <p> " Daddy collected guns , " Nancy explains . " I keep that up there like he had it . I want to keep everything the way he had it . I know it 's ridiculous to live way out here like this , but I 'm the only one who cares about preserving the place . " <p> " You behave , Hubert , " Roy blurts out when the dog hikes his leg against a chair . <p> " Do n't worry , " says Nancy , tugging at the dog 's collar . " I 'm sure Hubert 's excited . But he 'll calm down . Wo n't you , Hubert ? " <p> She shows them around the house . " Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim says in an undertone to Roy . Jim has humiliated him many times , but never like this . The girl is showing him a miniature blunderbuss , demonstrating how a little sword pops out , and Jim is whistling with amusement , his hands in his pockets . Roy is sure there 's half-a-million-dollars ' worth of antiques in the house . His eyes ca n't absorb them all  --  the pictures , lamps , a spinning wheel , a brass bed-warmer , a leather-bound trunk , several things he ca n't even identify . <p> " You 're going to have a big job , Hubert , " he says . <p> Nancy leaves them to explore while she shows the dog her room . Jewell should have come along , Roy thinks . She would like the long hallway lined with austere portraits of men wearing string ties and sour-faced women with bundles of hair . The women remind him of the women in church . He wishes they were here , so he could see their expressions when they saw Hubert 's new home . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her blue jeans and cowboy boots . For a moment , he thinks she is going to embrace him , but she asks , " Would you like some coffee ? " <p> " No . I do n't drink coffee . " <p> " We ought to be running along , " Jim says , consulting his watch . <p> Hubert is restless . His nails click on the polished floor . Roy has never heard the dog 's nails click against a floor before . His ruff is white , like the collar of the church lady in the portrait above the mantel . <p> " That was my grandmother , " says Nancy , when she sees Roy looking . <p> Roy studies the picture but ca n't think of anything to say . <p> " She was a character , " Nancy says with a laugh . " She kept a gin bottle under her pillow , and she had a parrot that could quote the Bible . " <p> Roy looks at Jim , who is standing by the door . <p> " Hubert 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I heard of a collie kept in the house , and he could n't rest till he had the whole family herded together in the living room . There was about ten of them and he kept running from room to room . You need you some cows so Hubert will have something to do . " <p> She laughs uproariously , as if he were joking . " Well , maybe I 'll have to get some cows for him ! " <p> As she stoops to pet the dog , Roy pulls his feed cap further down on his forehead and turns away . He says , " Hubert wo n't be happy unless he 's got something to round up . " <p> Roy does n't look back . Behind him , Hubert 's nails scratch the floor , and Roy can hear the click of the safety catch on his gun , a sound he has heard so many times in his mind , when he has imagined shooting the dog . <p> <p> By BOBBIE ANN MASON <p>        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
