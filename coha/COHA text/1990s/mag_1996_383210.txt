Our special section shows you how to find , and use , the extra space right over your head . // the southern home Adding Up // That unused attic space above your head can be a tempting option if your family needs a bit more room . The roof is there already and , perhaps , the stairs . All you need to do is finish a few walls and move on up . Oh , that it would be that easy .
