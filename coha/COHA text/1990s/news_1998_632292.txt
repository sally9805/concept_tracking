<p> ROCKFORD , Mich.  --  Most halls of fame honor noble accomplishments that forever stand tall . There 's hallowed spots for astronauts . Cowboys . Even rock ' n ' rollers , where you can hear Paul Revere and the Raiders sing " Hungry ( For Those Good Things ) . " <p> But there is one place where weenies go down in infamy . <p> That is the Hot Dog Hall of Fame , located in the Corner Bar and Restaurant , 31 N. Main ( 616-866-9866 ) in this scenic community of 4,500 , located about 10 miles north of Grand Rapids . <p> Anyone can gain immortality into the Hot Dog Hall of Fame . <p> Just eat a dozen chili dogs in four hours . <p> " I 'll tell you , if you get full at 11 or 12 , it does n't matter if you have a dozen hours , " said 69-year-old tavern owner Don Berg ( no relation to Chicago frankfurter king David Berg ) . " You just ca n't eat any more . " <p> An entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4,700 Hot Dog Hall of Famers who downed a dozen or more tube steaks in the alloted time period . Berg has sold more than 1,200 miles of hot dogs since 1965 , when he purchased the tavern on the ground floor of the oldest brick building in town . <p> The Corner Bar serves nine different hot dogs in a bun , including the pizza dog ( $ 1.50 ) , the burrito dog ( $ 1.50 ) and the New York-inspired slaw ' n ' chili dog ( $ 1.25 ) . The chili dogs are $ 1.08 , plus 30 cents off every sixth dog . I was full after eating one burrito dog and one chili dog . <p> The Babe Ruth of the Hot Dog Hall of Fame is Sharon VanDuinen , a 41-year-old dental hygienist from nearby Jenison . She set the house record in March , 1982 . She ate 42 3/4 chili dogs in four hours , chased by 15 mugs of Diet Pepsi . Sharon is 5-foot-3 , 110 pounds . <p> The Hall of Fame record still stands . So does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25 chili dogs , " Sharon recalled during a recent phone interview from her home . " The only thing you were allowed to leave out were mustard , onions and catsup . You had to have the chili sauce . <p> " I had 18 to go to break the record ( 42 , set by Dizzy Densmore of Greenwood , Mich. ) and three hours to do it . The first hour was n't bad . After that , they all started tasting pretty pasty . <p> " Every hour on the hour , they 'd bring me six chili dogs . It took the entire three hours . On my last dog , everyone in the bar was pounding on their tables , ' Come on ! ' ' Come on ! ' I had to walk outside to get air . Do you know how you feel when you 're getting car sick ? I was feeling pretty bog . " <p> After setting the record , Sharon wandered down the street to dance at Las Vegas night at the Lions club . " The whole town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in eating ) this record , " she said . " Everyone at Las Vegas night knew about it . We went there afterward , but it 's kind of a blur . They said I was dancing . Someone also said I was eating peanuts . " <p> In June , 1981 , Sharon set the Hot Dog Hall of Fame record/woman 's division by eating 20 chili dogs . " Just because I could , " she said . " My ex-brother-in-law is the salesman of all salesmen . After I ate the 20 , we went back to the Corner Bar and he was pumping me the whole time , saying , ' Shari , I know you can beat the record . ' So we get in the bar and he announces that I 'm going to do this . I figured I 'd do the best I can . " <p> Sharon rolled the dice and paid a price . <p> She gained 10 pounds after her frankfurter feat . She also could n't sleep the night after she set the record . " I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next day I wanted to eat a whole roast by myself . My stomach was that stretched out . It took me a month to lose that weight . " <p> In May , 1982 , Corner Bar manager Jim " Harpo " Richard organized the rematch that rocked Rockford : Sharon vs. former champ Densmore . Sharon reminisced , " Dizzy practiced eating hot dogs from March until May . We had a weigh-in . Dizzy weighed 220 pounds . I weighed in at 110 pounds . " <p> It would appear that Sharon was the underdog . <p> " He ate 12 hot dogs and barfed , " she said . " I ate 13 hot dogs in 16 minutes and whupped his butt again . " <p> Happily married with two children , Sharon returns to the Hot Dog Hall of Fame a couple times a year to bask in her glory of gluttony . She does have some appetizing tips . " When you start eating , it takes 20 minutes to feel full , " she said . " So you have to eat as fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's no technique . It 's just getting them down . " <p> Although Sharon set her amazing record in a tavern , alcohol was not involved . She drank Diet Pepsi and she recommends water for power pup consumption . <p> The Hot Dog Hall of Fame was offically established in 1968 after Detroit Lions football players Milt Plum , John Gordy and Ron Kramer dropped into the bar after playing Rockford high school teachers in a benefit basketball game . Berg said , " They had eight or 10 hot dogs ( each ) . " <p> Other notables who have sampled a Corner Bar dog include former Detroit Tiger Mickey Lolich , Chicago Bears Football Hall of Famer Dick Butkus and the late actor Dick ( " Bewitched " ) York , who lived outside Rockford . <p> The bar 's autographed pictures of Linda Ronstadt and other musicians come courtesy of Berg 's daughter Suzanne , a former vice president at Elektra Records . She now works at Impulse Records in New York . <p> The elder Berg conceded that Sharon 's record is tough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a guy who came in a few years ago around 1 a.m. , " said Berg , whose Chicago roots go back to uncle Ray MacMeal , who ran the Maywood Hotel . " This guy ate 35 hot dogs , but we had to kick him out at 2:30 . It was bar time . He was on his way to breaking the record . " <p> Berg used to sample a dog a day just to make sure the homemade chili was kicking in . The secret chili sauce was concocted in the 1930s by previous tavern owner George Myers , a former Army cook . <p> " The chili varies , " Berg said . " Sometimes it 's real spicy , sometimes the meat absorbs it , sometimes the meat does n't . " That 's the legacy at the Hot Dog Hall of Fame , where the bite is always better than the bark . <p> SPEED BUMPS : Will Bruce Springsteen have to rewrite " Cadillac Ranch " ?
