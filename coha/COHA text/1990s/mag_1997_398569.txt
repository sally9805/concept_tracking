A lot of thought went into the creation of a remarkable new Cabo 45 Sportfisher from award-winning Cat Harbor Boats . // Inspiration , preparation and innovation all come together in the new Cabo 45 Express Sportfisher , the latest in an evolutionary sequenceinitiated by Henry Mohrschladt , president of Cat Harbour Boats , whose earlier Pacific Seacraft sailboats were given a Fortune magazine " top 100 U.S.quality products " award . Cat Harbor was formed to bring Pacific Seacraft 's quality to a new marketplace . Without the unwanted baggage of locked-in design , style , or image , the people whose sailboats had been compared to topdrawer products like John Deere , Levi Strauss , 3M , and Steuben , started to design and build powerboats , specifically sportfishing boats . Their 35-and 31-foot hulls were huge successes driven to a large degree by the quality of construction and finish . The new 45 is meant to keep CAbo owners who are looking for that Cabo quality , but in a larger boat , safely in the fold . " More amenities , more room for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but with the quality of our smaller boats . That is what our customers told us they wanted , and now that we have the first 45 built available for demos and sea trials , we are getting orders . The response has been terriffic , " Mohrschladt told me as we started our inspection and sea trial . The fishing cocpit on the Cabo 45 is a deckhand 's dream . I loved the Carolina-style buil-in transom fish-box which also doubles as an above-ddeck live bait well . A tempered glass window shows at a glance the amount of live bait being held and alerts the crew to any seawater supply problems that could endanger the bait 's welfare . A turned-off switch , a blown circuit breaker , or a clogged intake line will be noticed and the problem rectified before valuable bait is lost . Additional fish/storage boxes lie to port and starboard under the cockpit sole . These large boxes are insulated and drained by macerator pumps that allow the boxes to be used for freshly caught or iced-down fish , as well as for fenders and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the transom door is special . The large custommade stainless steel hinges caught my eye and I asked Mohrschladt if he would sell me a set for a new boat I 'm running in Australia . I also admired the transom-door catch with a spring-loaded locking pin holding the handle down against the closing cam . Other minor items , including gas springs on the tackle bin/cockpit control recess , and the custom-made locking deck-hatch lift that secures the fully gasketed lazarette hatch also reflect Cabo 's quest for excellence in all aspects of engineering . Inside the lazarette area , a custom-built aluminum rudder stop drew my praise . There also is a large aluminum plate laminated into the cockpit deck to ensure that any heavyduty fighting chair mounted on the deck is there to stay . At the forward end of the cockpit , the engine-room access door shares the area , to port of the bridge steps , with a large bait freezer that has a clear plastic shelf to hold soft drinks and beer and a small recess with a freshwater wash-down nozzle . The engine room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The placement of the filters is exemplary : The port-engine secondary fuel filter and starboard-engine oil filter , which would otherwise be on the outboard sides of their big Cat 3196 diesels , are remote-mounted inboard for easy access , as are the primary Racor fuel filters . All wiring is run inside conduit channels with pop-off lids for a tidy installation that can be easily accessed for repairs or additions or deletions to the wiring bundle . Engraved plastic labels identify every valve , switch and component in an easy-to-understand system that will allow any new owner or skipper to instantly feel familiar and confident in doing both daily and more complex maintenance checks . Norscott dripless shaft seals eliminate messy stuff ing boxes , and I particularly liked the small oil reservoirs that obviate the need for pressurized seawater supply lines . Both main-engine seawater supplies have built-in induction bilge pumping take-offs ( with attractive plastic strainers ) suspended low in the bilge , should they ever be needed . A bilge high-water alarm is standard and should eliminate the need for the high-capacity capability the induction system provides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have seen supplied on a factory-built boat . To insure a quiet boat , even the exhaust mufflers have insulation blankets , and the engine-room access hatches have sound-reducing gasket seals . The Westerbeke genset is mounted in a fully enclosed sound shield . Photograph COMFORT ZONE : The 45 's salon features a commodious L-settee ( above ) that conceals a large hide-a-bed . Photograph LOOKIN ' GOOD : The handsome , shippy layout ( above ) has a wealth of creature comforts ; the 45 handles well in all conditions ( top ) . Photograph // The batteries are easy to get to and are held in individual fiberglass boxes . There is even an engine-room heat alarm adjacent to the after bulkhead . The twin 660-hp Caterpillar 3169 diesels I saw were the first production pair of this series , and they were well showcased in this hull . In fact , the only slight negative I could find was a tight squeeze between the forward end of the big Cats and the forward engine-room bulkhead , which would make changing a belt or servicing an alternator more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with shorter engine blocks . Up on the 45 's raised helm deck , a three-drawer tackle center lies to starboard of the steps up from the cockpit . The drawers are constructed of King StarBoard to avert swelling or rotting . The drawers are compartmentalized for maximum tackle storage . An L-shaped settee to port with fulllength rod storage underneath , and a smaller lounge to starboard , which also holds storage , provide maximum seating . This also permits a soft joint in the helm deck , which allows a large hatch to be removed for major engine repairs or replacement . The helm station is well laid out with all analog gauges , as well as provision for a full electronics package above , and surrounding , the steering and control console . When the morning 's cold front had passed and the skies had cleared , we headed out Fort Lauderdale 's Port Everglades inlet into a choppy , confused sea left over from a wind that had come around almost 180 degrees with the weather change . The Cabo ran well in all directions . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boat 's fine forward entry in a headsea punch , there was enough spray flying to reduce vision . I would have preferred the added height of the flying-bridge model . The ride was easy both upsea and quartering , without the pounding you would expect under these conditions . The big Cats had both trolling gears and a low-rpm slow-troll mode . The combination allowed us to creep ahead at an almost imperceptible crawl in a simulated live-bait trolling pattern . Then , back in conventional gear , we spun quickly and easily in both directions in simulated fish-fighting situations . When backing up downsea , almost no water entered the Cabo 's transom door , with its starboard battens functioning as protective sills . In the salon , a large U-shaped settee is covered in a luxurious imitation leather that 's resistant to stains from the inevitable water and sunblock . A double berth hide-a-bed is positioned under the aft section of the settee and a large space long enough to hold more rods and reels lies under the outboard section . A stereo/TV/VCR entertainment center hangs above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full galley is cleverly set up for maximum space utilization . A two-burner stovetop , as well as large trash and dry-goods storage spaces , lie under attractive and easyto-clean , removable countertop panels . There are seven varnished woodtrim storage cabinets above the countertop and four drawers and a cabinet under the countertop and sink . A central vacuum-cleaning system with more storage space lies under the steps from the helm deck . In the master stateroom there is still more rod storage above the queen-size island bunk . Gas springs help raise and then hold the bunk open above another large storage area . The six drawers below the bunk roll easily out on fully suspended guide tracks . A cedar-lined hanging locker is to port and another entertainment center is to starboard . The head and shower can be entered from either the salon or stateroom . The curved sliding shower stall door is a real space-saver . There is still more storage above and below the large mirror over the hand basin . With full vinylester resin and bi-axial stitched fabric construction , the Cabo 45 is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attention to detail that has become synonymous with the Cabo line of sportfishing boats . // Cabo 45 Express Sportfisher // <p>
