Gene therapy and gene-based drugs are two ways we could benefit from our growing mastery of genetic science . But there will be others as well , including new kinds of vaccines , new sources of transplant tissue , even techniques doctors may someday use to stave off the aging process . Here are just a few of the remarkable therapies on the cutting edge of genetic research that could make their way into mainstream medicine in the coming years : <P> TOMORROW 'S TISSUE FACTORY <P> While it 's true that just about every cell in the body has the instructions to make a complete human , most of those instructions are inactivated , and with good reason : the last thing you want is for your brain cells to start churning out stomach acid or your nose to turn into a kidney . The only time cells truly have the potential to turn into any and all body parts is very early in a pregnancy , when so-called stem cells have n't begun to specialize . <P> Yet this untapped potential could be a terrific boon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cells  --  brain cells in Alzheimer 's , cardiac cells in heart disease , pancreatic cells in diabetes , to name a few . If doctors could isolate stem cells , then direct their growth , they might be able to furnish patients with healthy replacement tissue . <P> It was incredibly difficult , but last fall scientists at the University of Wisconsin managed to isolate stem cells and get them to grow into neural , gut , muscle and bone cells . The process still ca n't be controlled , and may have unforeseen limitations . But if efforts to understand and master stem-cell development prove successful , doctors will have a therapeutic tool of incredible power . <P> The same applies to cloning , which is really just the other side of the coin . True cloning , as first shown with Dolly the sheep two years ago , involves taking a developed cell and reactivating the genome within , resetting its developmental instructions to a pristine state . Once that happens , the rejuvenated cell can develop into a full-fledged animal , genetically identical to its parent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milk production in a cow or low fat in a hog have real market value , biological carbon copies could become routine within a few years . This past year scientists have done for mice and cows what Ian Wilmut did for Dolly , and other creatures are bound to join the cloned menagerie in the coming year . <P> Human cloning , on the other hand , may be technically feasible but legally and emotionally more difficult . Still , one day it will happen . The ability to reset body cells to a pristine , undeveloped state could give doctors exactly the same advantages they would get from stem cells : the potential to make healthy body tissues of all sorts , and thus to cure disease . That could prove to be a true " miracle cure . "  --  By Michael D. Lemonick <P> SPIKING THE POTATOES <P> We all know that eating fruits and vegetables is good for us , but within the next decade we could be eating broccoli not just to make Mom happy but also as a way to deliver drugs that stave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The idea of vaccinating people with edible plants is very new , " says Dwayne Kirk of the Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research in Ithaca , N.Y . " But it 's a lot friendlier than injections. "
