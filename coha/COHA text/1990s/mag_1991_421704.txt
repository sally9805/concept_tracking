FEATURE THE BOARDROOM TO THE SHOWROOM , FROM THE HALLS OF THE EPA , TO THE , FACTORY FLOOR , YOU HEAR THE CRY : THERE 'S GOLD IN A GREENER PLANET <p> Perched in a steel- and glass-clad monolith at 1 Beacon Street ( yes , of Boston Brahmin fame ) , David Beckwith does n't so much submit to as take command of an interview . A paragon of Brooks Brothers sartorialism in his oxford shirt and power necktie , Beckwith 's delivery is crisp , ' pointed , intense , bandying about brokerspeak terms like capital nobility , long-term appreciation , and universe of attractive stocks . During the discussion , Beckwith persistently glances over at his VDT , presumably for upto-the-nanosecond input from Dow Jones . <p> Another New England entrepreneur , holding forth from a converted warehouse hung with tie-dyed banners just outside Burlington , Vermont , Alan Newman converses supine on a couch : " Back problems , " he says apologetically . This position enables his rainbow-socked , Birkenstock-shod feet to cross and uncross for emphasis , as strains of Van @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of attractive subjects includes out-of-body experience and a " kinder , softer spirit "  --  corporate style . <p> As diverse as Beckwith and Newman seem in dress and demeanor , they actually have a great deal in common . Both men are involved in businesses devoted to preserving and improving life on the planet for future generations by investing in green companies and green products . In fact the very diversity of these men demonstrates that green business is no longer considered a black-or-white affair , but now attracts an entire spectrum of , people who are convinced there are fortunes to be made in this field . <p> Beckwith is vice president and portfolio manager of a $56 million environmental fund at Freedom Capital Management Corporation , the one fund at Freedom devoted to investing in companies like Ionics , Inc. , which specializes in water treatment , and Imco Recycling , Inc . These companies , Beckwith says , contribute to a cleaner or healthier environment . <p> Newman is president of Seventh Generation , Inc. , a mail-order catalog business that features only environmentally friendly products , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonpolluting dishwashing liquid . Applying textbook business principles to a field virtually unknown five years ago , Newman has built up a multimillion-dollar money-spinner . <p> Beckwith and Newman are successful entrepreneurs sincerely devoted to the proposition that investing in green companies and buying , green products is not only good news for your conscience and for the environment but can also bring in big bucks . Says Beckwith : " The environmental track and the economic track are not perpendicular , they 're parallel ; they are common causes , more than competing causes . " Newman agrees : " Environmental responsibility makes economic sense ninety-nine out of a hundred times . <p> Similar testimony echoes from boardrooms to showrooms , from the halls of the Environmental Protection Agency to the factory floor : There is money to be made from saving the planet . Today government officials , mutual fund managers , and green consumer advocacy groups agree that it makes sense financially to consider the environmental impications of all corporate decisions , from products and services to philosophy and management style . <p> And in the future , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirty " companions far behind . Government and the venture capital community will take eco-minded companies more seriously . Green investing will be the wave of the future . Americans ' purchasing dollars will have the power to change corporate policy ; companies will sit up and listen to the green consumer . The prices for green products will actually come down , making them cheaper than their nongreen counterparts . We 'll even develop modular appliances that can be easily customized . Instead of throwing out an old refrigerator , we 'll buy one for life and update it-spelling the end of the concept of planned obsolescence . <p> On , the practical level , green companies not only try to produce products that are not harmful to the environment , but also work to produce these products through processes that are kind to the environment . A green company might manufacture , say , natural cosmetics , not tested on animals , as opposed to polystyrene containers that are not easily recyclable , clog landfills , and whose production contributes to the depletion of the ozone layer . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , enable customers to choose items that will do minimum damage to the planet , without significantly sacrificing convenience or quality . <p> Beyond products and services , green companies espouse a certain philosophy and management style from the CEO on down : They understand that industry must take responsibility for its employees , neighboring communities , and the planet as a whole-not just now , but in the long term . <p> Products should be manufactured using the least amount of energy and producing the least amount of toxic byproducts possible . Employees should enjoy decent wages and benefits , perhaps a profit-sharing program ; and there should be a regular forum enabling them to voice their concerns complaints , and suggestions to management . In turn , administrators should enlist the expertise of the EPA and environmental groups on how to best use their resources . And a percentage of profits might be earmarked for local or international green organizations . <p> " We got into Seventh Generation so we could leave the world in a better situation than we found it when we started , " says Newman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps unwittingly , set the green business revolution in motion . " Reagan said that government was not going to fund social programs any longer , " Newman says . " It took ten years for us to figure out that business had to step into the vacuum and start contributing to positive change . " <p> Seventh Generation donates 1 percent of its revenues to nonprofit environmental organizations . It runs inhouse seminars to educate employees , on environmental issues . It is fanatical about recycling and using recycled products like cardboard shipping boxes . <p> What really differentiates the greens from the nongreens , however , is that green companies pay attention to a double bottom line : They place equal value on ecological and fiscal considerations . Environmentalists and economists concur : Companies with this positive attitude toward the environment , on-site and around the world , are miles ahead of the competition when it comes to making informed management decisions , and they are going to see substantial financial rewards for their commitment to environmental ideals . <p> Earth 's Best of Middlebury , Vermont , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce that 's better for babies , farmers , and the ecosystem . Earth Care Paper based in Madison , Wisconsin , recycles paper products . It has a special ethics task force that , for instance , fielded a request from Exxon for office supplies by saying , We 'll sell you our paper if you change your environmental policies . ( Exxon declined . ) <p> And shoppers in Santa Fe can find green products at How On Earth , with 2,300 square feet of merchandise , where everything  --  from the biodegradable floor tiling to the solar-powered company car  --  embodies the philosophy that green products pay for themselves in savings on packaging costs ( concentrated laundry detergent sold in small , recyclable containers ) . <p> Naturally , the financial community wants a piece of the action . Green investing is a specialty for mutual fund managers at the Calvert Group in Washington , DC , who seek out environmentally responsible companies , asserting that this is a promising low-risk , long-term growth area . Green investors predict that the green movement is more than a passing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big business , and that stockholders do n't want to be responsible for a polluting company 's cleaning up after itself . <p> To spur America on to environmental responsibility , the EPA has developed programs like Green Lights , which encourages corporations to install energy-efficient lighting . If U.S. companies want to be serious players in the international arena , some environmentalists argue , adopting green management principles is the best way to regain our competitive edge . " The United States does n't have to lose thirty percent of our business to lose the edge ; we can lose five percent , " says John Hoffman , director of the EPA 's Division of Global Change . " We 've got to make savings if we want to accrue capital ; we 'll need new money to invest if we want to be competitive in world markets . Japan and Germany use half the energy that the United States does to achieve the same productivity . " <p> Of course , EPA officials understand that a complex array of carrots and sticks will be required to persuade industrial interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In addition to programs like Green Lights to encourage conservation , the EPA is authorized under the Clean Air and Clean Water acts to penalize " dirty " companies . " Industry must realize that it 's bad business to be dirty , " says Eileen Claussen , director of the EPA 's Office of Atmospheric and Indoor Air Programs . More to the point , industry 's getting the message loud and clear : There 's money to be made by cleaning up its act . <p> " Being green will increase sales because there is a growing distinction in the public mind between ' dirties ' and the true greens , " Claussen says , Pollution prevention , she says , means energy efficiency : Companies can save money by saving energy . " It 's cheaper to clean up sooner rather than later , and it 's cheapest to reengineer to prevent the mess in the first place , " she says . <p> Alisa Gravitz , executive director of Coop America , a nonprofit green consumer advocacy group based in Washington , DC , calls for " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Environmental interests should be on the table , represented in business decisions . This tenet of green management is known as stakeholder management . <p> Steve Schueth , vice president for Socially Responsible Investing at the Calvert Group , says , " When making a decision in the boardroom , all stakeholders must be considered management holders . " Who are the stakeholders ? Employees , the community , the planet . " Each should be considered without preference . By doing this , management will make better , less volatile decisions . " <p> Some of the companies Schueth sees as appropriate for his investors at first glance may not seem typical ecominded operations . For instance , Schueth says , Clorox is a " strong environmental company . " Surprised ? Take a closer look . " Bleach is not particularly toxic , " Schueth says . " Its production , however , has a very toxic by-product , chlorine gas . " But Clorox has a state-of-the-art system to treat this gas , and an emergency response system to protect employees and the community . According to Schueth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendly , and it supports the community and education . <p> Green consumers , an increasingly visible and voluble group , actively seek out goods produced , by ecology-minded companies . Newman says that customers want to do business with a corporation that has a set of social values , and they will choose products based on a company 's track record . Arnie Koss , cofounder of Earth 's Best , says that the baby food industry is a prime example of a business offering a great opportunity to tap into the sensibility of the green consumer . <p> " We felt that if we did things right and were n't just hype , just a marketing facade , we would be appreciated . " And the company has inspired a great deal of brand loyalty among its customers : " They see us as a company that 's different , and they actually want us to succeed . What we enjoy out there in the marketplace is that most prized resource : goodwill . " <p> Advocacy groups such as Co-0p America are making it increasingly difficult for " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by spurring on the public to economic activism . Consumers must realize that what they do in the supermarket does make a difference . <p> " People feel it 's hard as an individual to do anything , " says William Burns , director of environmental affairs at Earth Care Paper . " Green consumerism is a means of individual empowerment . " Consumers can effect corporate change : Look at Starkist , which introduced " dolphin-free " tuna , and McDonald 's , which agreed to discontinue polystyrene packaging . <p> " Companies are bound to sit up and listen if they want to stay competitive , " says Gravitz . " When a dollar leaves your hand , it goes to companies that are either doing work you support or undoing work you support . You need to make that distinction in your mind and purchase accordingly . " <p> Green consumerism , however , does not come without its price . Many Earth-friendly products are 5 , 10 , up to 25 percent more expensive than their non-green counterparts . A jar of Earth 's Best carrots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nonorganic competitors . " Today many people live paycheck to paycheck ; they are n't in a position to pay out a lot of extra money , " says Jeffrey Wellman , manager of How On Earth . <p> Wellman says the store is looking at ways " to make our products more readily available to lower-income people . We 're considering a deferred payment plan or setting aside one percent of our profits to assist people who otherwise would n't be able to shop here . " <p> Some green products can actually be had for fewer greenbacks . Although initially these items appear to cost more , they cost less , and in some cases will even pay for themselves , over time . How On Earth sells a small box of concentrated laundry detergent . Although it costs more than the same size box at the supermarket , at only three tablespoons per load the small box will do 48 loads but costs the same as a large supermarket box that will do only 15 . <p> While some green products offer modest savings to consumers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For instance , the EPA is trying to persuade big companies to install more efficient lighting . " They can save $21.50 per socket , per year by replacing conventional bulbs with compact fluorescents , " says Hoffman , who directs the EPA 's Green Lights program . " For a company with several thousand employees , three or four sockets per employee , we 're talking about tens of thousands of dollars saved every year . " <p> The EPA has made believers of more than 41 companies , including heavy hitters like Bell Atlantic , Citicorp , and Nike , and it hopes to turn on Fortune 500 corporations to green lighting . " Green products equal high-value products , " says Hoffman . " There might be a higher initial cost , but we 're talking about value purchasing over a life cycle . " The EPA hopes that corporate honchos will see the light and introduce green principles elsewhere in their companies . " It 's simple , " Hoffman says . " Green marketing is consistent with high-value marketing . The smart companies are no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Beckwith figures that cleaning up the environment is going to be increasingly big business . " The United States is spending a hundred billion dollars annually on the environment , " he says . " Most reports expect that to double in the next ten years . " And the major ecological problems are not going to go away anytime soon . " The companies we 're investing in are resilient , their services are always in demand : Water is indispensable , garbage needs to be disposed of daily , there 'll always be a need for alternative energy , " he says . <p> Schueth argues that Calvert does not consider " dirty " industries to be attractive investments . " Our investors do n't want to have to pay for a company 's cleaning up its past mistakes , or for completely retooling so it does n't make similar ones in the future , " Schueth says , Delving into a company 's soiled environmental past makes for a lot more work- " ten times the usual man-hours researching prospective companies , " Schueth says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at both how the company is managed and its possible impact on the environment . We look at a double bottom line . " <p> As to the future of green products , W David Stephenson , a management consultant specializing in green issues , forecasts , " We 're going to abandon the concept of planned obsolescence . Any consumer back out in the marketplace wo n't necessarily buy your product again , especially if it broke down after a year : He can choose another company 's product . " <p> Stephenson foresees the development of modular appliances , with plug-in features that can be updated and customized . Take , for instance , a refrigerator that people buy once in maybe 15 years . If that refrigerator were made of modular units  --  plug-in shelves that could be customized , an in-door icemaker that could be updated every five years  --  companies could continue to make money off the original refrigerator . " This will develop system loyalty , " Stephenson says . " And it should be an open system , sort of like computer software @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use your add-ons . " <p> Where cost is concerned , Gravitz predicts , some prices will come down : Products will be made of simpler and fewer materials and have less packaging . Prices for nongreen products , however , may actually increase . <p> " There will be more cradle-to-grave analysis to determine the true cost of a product , " she says . " If we want to be truthful to consumers , we 'll have to start internalizing the presently externalized costs-the cost of cleaning up CFC pollution will be included in the price of polystyrene containers-and that will cause prices to rise . " Finally , as demand increases , new technologies for recycling will be discovered , more companies will produce green products , and prices will fall . <p> If the experts are correct , green businesses will do increasingly well in the future . Gravitz says that as the population declines , " companies will be chasing after fewer customers and fewer sales ; they will have to get really savvy , and the green companies will have an edge . " As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employees . " With the diminishing of the baby boom , the current employers ' market will become an employees ' market , " she says . " Job applicants will question corporate policy , and companies will face stiff competition for the best and the brightest . " <p> Business has to make a change because time is running out , and we 'll soon be facing a point of no return . Arnie Koss insists that companies must lead the way . " It is essential for business today to be responsible , not just to the bottom line  --  that 's one-dimensional  --  but to the added bottom line , the one that considers how we can improve the environment . " <p> Fortunately , we wo n't have to rely on the altruism of business . American companies are beginning to understand that green business is better business . Burns says Earth Care Paper is a " perfect example that you can make money and spread the gospel . We 're a company that spends money on issues , and is doing very well . " Koss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and be very successful . " <p> PHOTO : IN THE FUTURE , EXPERTS AY , GREEN COMPANIES WILL OUTSHINE THEIR " DIRTY " BROTHERS . IT 'S BUSINESS 'S NEXT WAVE , SAYS SEVENTH GENERATION 'S ALAN NEWMAN , BELOW . <p> By MELANIE MENAGH <p> IN OUR TIME : A GREEN , WELL-LIGHTED PLACE <p> Architecture and design for the green office follow , two interconnected tracks : Materials and procedures employed should not be harmful to the ecosystem ; and the interior environment should promote the health and well-being of all employees . Seem like pretty simple premises ? Surprisingly , the , majority of architects and designers today either eschew or are , ignorant of these basic principles . <p> Not so Kirsten Childs , director of interior design for Croxton Collaborative , a New York City firm specializing in green architecture . <p> Croxton has designed space for several eco-minded , organizations  --  notably , award-winning offices for the Natural Resources Defense Council ( NRDC ) and an upcoming project remodeling an entire building for the Audubon Society . The best way to win prospective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost-savings offered by green design . " We do n't go in and talk about the environment ; we talk about what we can do to save them money , " says Childs . " The NRDC is saving more than fifty percent of energy costs compared with a conventionally fitted office . " <p> Perhaps the most significant savings derive from an energy-efficient approach to lighting . <p> " Lighting represents thirty percent of all energy used - not only for illumination but also for cooling costs , " Childs says . Croxton is cutting down on lighting at Audubon and the NRDC hy installing highly efficient fixtures , using smaller fluorescent lamps ( bulbs ) with electronic ballasts ( solid-state sockets that increase lamp efficiency ) , including occupancy sensors ( motion-sensitive switches that turn off lights when a room is vacated ) , and maximizing daylight by using glass transoms to permit it to flow throughout the office . <p> Cutting , back on lighting not , only saves energy , it also saves employees from headache and fatigue caused by eyestrain . Peter Flack , managing principal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the NRDC and Audubon , says that adjusting the quality of light is as important as adjusting the quantity . <p> Flack advocates using warmer , more amber-white , less blue-white , light . Ideally , light should be reflected , ( shining upward , from a cabinet , for instance ) rather than direct , which causes glare . <p> Air quality is another important aspect of the green office . " Sick building syndrome " has received a lot of press when disease-causing bacteria breeding in air-conditioning units have spread through sealed buildings , sickening workers . <p> Douglas Greenwood , manager of , the Environmental Resource Program at the American Institute of Architects , based in Washington , DC , says that ironically , " the air you breathe on a city street is better than that in most offices . " William McDonough , director of William McDonoUgh Architects in New York City , is another preeminent ; ' green practitioner . " Presently , an architect has to trip though a minefield of toxic building materials , " McDonough says . Synthetic fiber carpets and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) toxins ; particleboard used in office furniture off-gasses formaldehyde ; oil-based paints give off fumes . Aggravating the problem is the lack of fresh air . Childs says that Croxton designs call for fresh air to be circulated through an office six or seven times per hour . <p> " You can tell the difference at the NRDC , " she says . " Workers benefit ; the air feels good all the time . " Studies show that by using nontoxic building materials and proper ventilation , worker productivity increases . <p> Finally , green office design strives to preserve the global environment and its precious resources . The Audubon project includes a gas-fired heating and cooling system . Burning gas generates fewer noxious substances ( like the sulfuric acid responsible for acid rain ) and reduces carbon mon-and dioxide emissions ( causes of global warming ) . Green designers also frown upon the profligate use of endangered species such as mahogany or teak . Bill McDonough says , " If you , want to use hardwoods , buy from a source that 's practicing sustainable forestry . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you use it sparingly , treating it like the precious commodity that it is . " WHAT CAN YOU DO ? <p> There are plenty of simple things you can do to make your office a greener place . Most eco-minded products can be found everywhere . " We do n't use , state-of-the-art equipment ; we just bring together materials available on the market , " Childs ' Says . And many green materials are also economical over the long haul . LIGHTING : Decrease the number of lamps ( bulbs ) in fluorescent fixtures . Use task lighting ( i.e. a small , individual light at your workstation ) with a fluorescent ( not incandescent ) lamp . Change color rendition from blue-white to a warmer amber-white light . Replace conventional ballasts with more efficient electronic ballasts . Change fluorescent lamps from T12 to T-8 ( a smaller , more efficient light bulb ) . AIR QUALITY : Trace the path of the air you 're breathing to the outdoors . Be sure you are getting fresh air . Air intake vents may be over a dumpster or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money on energy . Do n't use air fresheners to dull the senses and mask problems . Try to use latex paints ; tack down carpet ( instead of gluing ) install furniture made of solid wood ( not particleboard ) . Talk to your cleaning service about any harsh chemicals it might use . Be sure anything that gives off fumes ( a copying machine , for example ) is properly vented . CONSERVATION : Set up a recycling program . Use vinegar to wash windows . Avoid cleansers with solvents ; try lemon oil . Skip disposable polystyrene cups use ceramic mugs instead . Request that your food service do away with plastic plates and knives . No disposable pens ( use a fountain pen ) or pencils ( use mechanical pencils ) . Carpool or take public transportation to work . <p>
