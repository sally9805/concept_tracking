Handshakes , public and private , carried more symbolism than usual during the 36-hour Middle East summit at the White House last week . Each of the leaders taking part in the meeting and most of the millions watching it held in their mind an image of that awe-inspiring 1993 handshake on the South Lawn . Now , however , Yasser Arafat was face to face with Benjamin Netanyahu , the head of a very different Israeli government , and most onlookers hoped the magic of a handshake might cast another spell . In the closing moments outside the White House on Wednesday , Netanyahu grasped Arafat 's hand and pumped it , adding his left hand atop the grip . Arafat joined in , leaning toward the Israeli , smiling broadly . It was symbolic . But was it significant ? After that farewell , Arafat 's hands were empty again . <P> It was a summit on short notice . But the peace process was threatened by the worst fighting between Palestinians and Israelis in 30 years . Something had to be done immediately . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not talking voluntary checkup here . We 're talking emergency-room procedure . " Stanching the bleeding proved to be perhaps no better than first aid . In public the principals mustered a modest bonhomie to mute the disappointment . But TIME 's look behind the closed-door negotiations , from Jerusalem to Cairo to Washington , found that under the smiles and civility lies the old intransigence . <P> At first the summit was to be held in Cairo . But Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak refused to be host unless Netanyahu agreed in advance to some substantive concessions , which he did not . Since speed was essential , Clinton accepted Secretary of State Warren Christopher 's suggestion that the U.S. President convene the summit in Washington . The invitations went out . But Arafat delayed his response as long as he could , hoping for some sign of concessions from Netanyahu . <P> Arafat spent much of Monday , Sept. 30 , in the grand salon of Mubarak 's summer residence near Alexandria . He said he felt he could go to Washington only if Mubarak joined him there . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he declined an invitation to the summit . Mubarak , aides indicated , was no longer willing to take domestic political risks for a peace process stalled by Israel . But the Egyptian President insisted that Arafat go anyway . " Mubarak spent three hours convincing him he should , " says an Egyptian official . " Mubarak told him , ' You have a cause to fight for . ' " <P> Netanyahu for his part had readily agreed to the summit  --  but not to concessions . He made it clear to reporters on his plane on the way over that he assumed Clinton would press hard for concessions . Presumably those would start with closing the archaeological tunnel that had touched off the violence and follow with a firm date for redeploying Israeli troops in the West Bank city of Hebron , a step already six months overdue . He was more than ready to resist .
