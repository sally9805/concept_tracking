<p> Doors opening : Fulton County sets goals to award contracts to female- owned firms . <p> Carolyn Stradley has been paving roads for more than two decades , the past 13 years as president of her own company , C &; S Paving . <p> She 's put down asphalt for the U.S. Air Force and even won a small- business award from President Bush in 1989 . But when she tried to buy an insurance bond for a job six months ago , the bonding company demanded that her husband sign for it . <p> " I told them I would get a divorce before I ever allowed my husband to sign one of my bonds , " Ms. Stradley said . " I said , ' I want to see how many of your male clients have their wives sign . ' " She got the bond without the benefit of her husband 's signature . <p> Across metro Atlanta , female business owners tell similar stories about the doors closed to them just because they are women , and the extra effort they put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ease the discrimination , Fulton County this month is poised to join a growing list of local governments and agencies that have established goals for awarding business to women . <p> " We would like the same opportunities as other minorities , " said Gloria Boatwright , Georgia president of Women Construction Owners and Executives . " We do n't see it as an open checkbook . " <p> Fulton 's proposed policy calls for 5 percent of all county contracts and purchase orders to go to women , and it establishes new goals for businesses owned by African Americans , Hispanics , Asians and American Indians . <p> The goals for women - urged by Fulton 's first female commissioner , Nancy Boxill - follow a dismal year in the county for female business owners , who received less than 2 percent of county contracts in 1991 . <p> " It has not been enough , " Ms. Boxill said of the contracts awarded to women . " This should encourage us to do better . " <p> Fulton 's proposed policy has been greeted enthusiastically by women who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and land contracts in the private sector . <p> The contacts Gwen Mitchell-Byrd made while working this year as a minority subcontractor for Motorola Inc. on a Fulton job led her to purchase a majority share in a Motorola service shop . <p> She is the first black woman to own a Motorola service business in the United States . " Things have worked out great for me , " said Ms. Mitchell-Byrd , president of Atlanta Communications Co . <p> But many women are wary of programs designed to help them . <p> Anna Sistrunk , vice president of Sisco Snack Sales , worked to get her husband 's vending machine distribution company certified as a black- owned business with Fulton County in 1990 and has tried repeatedly to win some Fulton jobs . So far , the experience has been a bust . <p> " It just seemed to be fruitless to go through all that paperwork if you are just going to be on an approved list that is just a list , " Ms. Sistrunk said . <p> ' Political clout ' necessary ? <p> Maria Rossini @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursued design contracts with Fulton , DeKalb County and the city of Atlanta for four years . But she has yet to land any work as either a Hispanic or Asian , the two minority categories under which she qualifies . <p> " It does n't matter if you are a woman or whatever , you have to have political clout , " Ms. Rossini said . " You can either go and get in with commissioners or the public officials by getting involved in their campaigns , donating money so they will remember you . . . or sit on the sidelines and hope you get a break . " <p> Anna Cablik , a Hispanic contractor , got her first break in 1982 when she helped build MARTA 's Lakewood station as a minority subcontractor . Now , Ms. Cablik believes she ca n't get much public business because affirmative-action programs are geared only to black-owned firms . <p> " They do not want to recognize you as a minority , " she said . <p> Spreading the word <p> The perception that minority contracts benefit a select few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The track record has not been good , " said David Gibson , a management consultant who has been unable to obtain Fulton County business . " An effort needs to be made to spread the word so that others may participate . " <p> Fulton officials said they are determined to make their program fair to all minority business owners . Commissioner Emma I. Darnell , who helped launch Mayor Maynard H. Jackson 's affirmative-action program in the 1970s , has emerged as a strong proponent of fair play . <p> " We are not interested in developing black millionaires or Hispanic millionaires , " she said . " We are interested in developing minority businesses in Fulton County . " <p> Fulton 's existing minority program , begun in 1987 , has certified more than 550 businesses to become eligible for county work . It has been a boon to many . <p> Last year , a Fulton contract compliance officer helped Betty Stratton negotiate a contract to put down the carpeting at the Georgia Dome . Successful in that job , Ms. Stratton 's interior design firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's new E concourse . <p> " It should give us an opportunity to prove ourselves , " Ms. Stratton said . " We just have to be there and do a good job , finish on time and within budget . " <p> Other governments set goals <p> Fulton is the second public body to adopt new affirmative-action goals this year . The Atlanta Board of Education fixed a 3 percent goal for women in May ; the city of Atlanta set a 3 percent goal last year . <p> DeKalb County has had a female business program for more than a decade . MARTA and the Georgia Department of Transportation also have programs . <p> Fulton 's program attempts to address other problems encountered by minorities . <p> Performance bonds guaranteeing a project can be completed if the contractor goes out of business , required for government contracts , are one of the biggest obstacles for small companies . <p> Fulton 's affirmative-action policy proposes to allow minority-owned companies to take out bonds for a percentage of the contract amount , reducing the cost . <p> ' A level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enact local legislation that would reduce the number of contracts that must be sought by sealed bids , giving purchasing agents greater flexibility in awarding contracts to minority vendors . <p> Many minority businesses can not afford to wait the 90 days that it typically takes for the county to pay them , so the proposed policy calls for reducing the payment delay to 30 days . <p> Officials also hope to increase the number of contracts that are awarded as joint ventures between large companies and smaller , minority- owned firms . The goal is to help minority or female-owned companies learn skills and gain experience by pairing them with bigger concerns . <p> " We 're trying to create a level playing field , " Ms. Darnell said . " It 's up to the government to remove all the obstacles . "
