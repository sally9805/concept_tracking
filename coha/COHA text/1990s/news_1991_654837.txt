<p> THE latest agreement between the Kurdish wing of the Iraqi opposition and the central government in Baghdad should be encouraged , not viewed with cynicism . A look at the fragmented internal makeup of the Iraqi opposition , as evidenced at recent gatherings in Saudi Arabia and in Beirut , explains why . <p> The problem is not that the opposition consists of Kurdish separatists and Shiite fundamentalists . Indeed , if these were the only opposition elements , they could conceivably form a coalition capable of running a government . <p> The problem is that there are so many different opposition elements , most at deadly odds with one another , that they would find it difficult to form a government even under the most ideal circumstances . They could certainly never effectively deal with Iraq 's current devastated economy and infrastructure . <p> It is crucial that policymakers in the United States should not be so blinded by hatred of Saddam that they risk future stability in the region . A careful and rational look at the makeup of the Iraqi opposition might illustrate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fall upon the unfortunate people of that country if the existing regime falls apart . <p> The 200 representatives of the Iraqi opposition who met in Beirut on March 11 represented 20 factions loosely subsumed under four ideological orientations : the Islamists , who had 80 representatives ; the Kurdish separatist movement ; the communists ; and the Pan-Arabists . <p> In reality , these movements have as many differences among themselves as they do with the regime of Saddam Hussein . <p> First , within the Islamic movement there are multiple factions , three of which fall under the Supreme Council of the Islamic Revolution . This council is led by Hujatalislam Mohamed Baker al Hakeem , a revered Arab Shiite figure with headquarters in Tehran . <p> Two other more radical Islamic factions are those of the Dawa Party , a transnational organization currently led by Sheikh Al Utaifi that has earned the support of radical groups since its establishment in 1958 . The Dawa Party , since its creation , has been committed to the idea of Islamic Jihad . In many instances , it has displayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This group is more likely to show tolerance to Saddam than it would to a Saudi or Syrian backed government . Both Syria and Saudi Arabia have slaughtered Dawa members in their countries . <p> Another faction , called Islamic Action , is inspired by the teachings of sheik Taqi Modarrisi , leader of the broad-based " Islamic Amal " movement . The Islamic Amal movement has differences with both the Dawa and the council led by al Hekeem . This conflict manifested itself in the Hizbullah/Amal clashes in Lebanon . In a 1984 interview in the French magazine " Jeune Afrique , " Modarrisi said that at any time he can assemble 500 faithfuls ready to throw themselves into suicide missions . <p> The Kurdish Front , established in 1985 , divides along both tribal and ideological lines . Within it are six factions : the Kurdish Democratic Party led by Al Barazani ; the Kurdistan Patriotic Union formed in 1970 and led by Galal Al Talabani ; the Kurdish Socialist Party led by Rasoul Mamind ; the People 's Democratic Union of Kurdistan led by Sami Abdella ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and the Kurdish Proletariat Party led by Sami Abdelrahman . <p> Both the Barazanis and Talabanis ( the surnames are tribal ) were partners in the Kurdish Democratic Party . When Iran under the Shah stopped assisting Mulla Mostafa Barazani in the early ' 70s , Talabani moved from Syria to Iraq to rally support against Mulla Mostafa . Talabani 's attempt failed . He therefore decided to divide the party along tribal lines and form what is now known as the Kurdistan Patriotic Union . <p> In addition , the Talabanis decided to carry the party to the left , moving away from the Barazani religious Mulla whom Talabani portrayed as a traitor to the Kurdish cause . <p> The other four factions represent a revolt against the Talabani and the Barazani tribal dominance of Kurdish politics . <p> A third orientation of some of the Iraqi opposition who assembled in Beirut is communism . Among the communists are two factions : the progressive Iraqi Movement led by Aziz Mohammed and the Democratic coalition led by Saleh Dakla . These two parties represent the far left of Saddam Hussein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they still enjoy the backing of Arab communist parties , particularly in Lebanon . <p> Finally , the fourth orientation , considered the weakest opposition element , is Pan-Arabism . This movement , too , has divided loyalties . One wing is backed by Syria , while the other splintered away from the now-governing Baath party . The Pan-Arabists only strength is that they are Sunni Arabs who will be favored by Arab allies of the US . <p> In addition to the four major orientation mentioned above , two Iraqi groups were established during the Gulf crisis . The Free Iraq movement , headquartered in London , is led by Saad Jaber , a businessman who once lived in the US . Mr. Jaber began his political career early in the crisis by telling CBS 's " 60 Minutes " a tale about Iraq 's alleged purchase of the Persian crown jewels . The second recently formed group is the Iraqi Salvation Front , based in Saudi Arabia . It is led by the former information minister , Salah al Ali . <p> The meeting places of these groups are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Damascus are under the Tehran-Damascus axis , while those convening in Saudi Arabia and London are combating a Shiite dominance over the grand coalition opposing Saddam . <p> It is important to note that all the Arab countries that joined the US-led military campaign against Saddam are Sunni Muslim and would not be pleased by a Shiite government in Iraq . <p> In Kuwait , we have seen the friction between those who fought the media war outside the country and those who stayed to fight the Iraqi occupiers . The Iraqi opposition could be in the same boat . If Kuwait , with only two factions contending for power , has had so much difficulty restoring even basic services and a semblance of law , how could an opposition government in Iraq deal with that country 's more widespread difficulties . <p> Even within the agreement evolving between the Kurds and Baghdad , a civil war may be difficult to prevent simply because other groups feel a sense of betrayal that the Kurds negotiated a deal of their own . And if civil war resumed , fed by disagreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turkey , Iran , and Syria could be drawn in , occupying parts of Iraq to contain the war inside Iraq , similar to what Israel and Syria did in Lebanon . Furthermore , such a spillover could destabilize the predominantly Shiite eastern province of Saudi Arabia . It could also extend to the Zaidi Shiites of Yemen , who represent a majority in that country . <p> Which faction would get its hands on Iraq 's stockpiles of chemical weapons ? Will they be in the hands of Shiites , or of the Kurds ? The chances that such weaponry might be used could be heightened . These concerns should be given priority in any rational agenda that attempts to address the Iraqi situation . <p> It is a cruel irony that the people of Iraq should continue to suffer under the tyranny of Saddam . However , the alternative , a Lebanon-style , multifactional civil war in a country already rendered totally dysfunctional would be even more cruel , as well as more dangerous .
