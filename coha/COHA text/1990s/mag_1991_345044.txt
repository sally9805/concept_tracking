The ringing of the telephone awakened Douglas MacArthur just after 3:30 a.m. in his air-conditioned six-room penthouse atop the Manila Hotel . Japanese bombers had just ravaged Pearl Harbor , the caller said . " Pearl Harbor ! " echoed MacArthur . " It should be our strongest point ! " <P> The 61-year-old " Field Marshal " asked his wife Jean to bring him his Bible , and he read in it , as he did every morning , for about 10 minutes . It brought him little comfort . At this moment of crisis , facing a threat that imperiled his life , his command and his whole world , America 's greatest living military hero , the bemedaled veteran of bayonet charges through no-man's-land in France , seemed paralyzed . When he did go to his nearby headquarters , he issued no orders to his forces . Officers seeking instructions found themselves barred from his presence . <P> When nearly 200 Japanese bombers finally arrived over Manila , fully 10 hours after the raid on Pearl Harbor , the pilots were amazed to find most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South Pacific , lined up like targets on the runways . They proceeded to destroy everything they saw . <P> " Instead of encountering a swarm of enemy fighters , " recalled Saburo Sakai , pilot of a Zero fighter , " we looked down and saw some 60 enemy bombers and fighters neatly parked . They squatted there like sitting ducks . Our accuracy was phenomenal . The entire air base seemed to be rising into the air with the explosions . Great fires erupted , and smoke boiled upward . " <P> Afterward Lieut . Colonel Eugene Eubank telephoned MacArthur 's headquarters and said , " I want to report that you no longer have to worry about your Bomber Command . We do n't have one . The Japanese have just destroyed Clark Field . " <P> If Pearl Harbor was a disaster for the U.S. , the Japanese attack on the Philippines that same day ( Dec. 8 on the far side of the international date line ) was in many ways worse . American casualties were much lower  --  some 80 killed in the Philippines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were higher . The raids on Clark and Iba fields outside Manila wrecked 18 out of MacArthur 's fledgling force of 35 B-17 bombers , 56 of his 72 P-40 fighters and 25 other planes . In returning later to pound the airfields again , the Japanese also smashed the Cavite naval base . And while Pearl Harbor was a hit- and-run raid , the Japanese would seize and hold the Philippines for the next three years . <P> Pearl Harbor represented just one small part of the Japanese master plan for the conquest of Southeast Asia . Tokyo launched attacks in that same December week not only against U.S. outposts in the Philippines , Wake Island and Guam but also against the Dutch East Indies ( now Indonesia ) and the British colonies of Malaya , Burma and Hong Kong . The methodical Japanese had printed the currencies for their occupation of all these lands as early as the spring of 1941 . And they conquered this vast sweep of territory so easily that the immediate worry was whether they would strike next at ill-defended Australia , ill-defended India or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , and one of its generals warned against a new kind of overconfidence : " victory disease .
