<p> He is brilliant . He is broke . He is a prophet . A fruitcake . A flop . He is the most famous scientist on Earth . But he has n't been taking phone calls for days , so you just show up at his door . <p> From outside , you can hear the phone ringing and ringing , so you guess no one is home . Then the door opens and there he is . A dangerous man , it is said . He has been denounced by the president of the United States , castigated by the secretary of health and human services , threatened by the Food and Drug Administration . Congressmen want to pass a law to prevent him from doing the terrible thing he wants to do . <p> He blinks , befuddled . His trousers do not match his jacket . His lapel bears a juicy stain . You are not the Fed Ex man ? <p> No . <p> Confound it . He should not have answered the door . <p> Behind him the phone keeps ringing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Too many reporters , calling from too many places . The last one was Bogota . Some people have left messages offering oodles of money , he says . He 'll get back to them when he can . He 's afraid the answering machine tape has run out . Confound it . <p> Distractedly , he waves you to a seat . The furniture is old , the fabric shiny . He walks with an old man 's stoop and shuffle . His great , gaunt body is adrift in his clothes , his pants hanging loosely from clip-on suspenders . His face is fissured , his eyes haunted , his mouth set in a thin , wry grin . <p> What does the scientist want ? Fame ? Riches ? Eternal life ? <p> Yes , yes and yes . This last one in particular intrigues him . <p> " There is a powerful urge to live , " he says . " The urge to die is negligible . If you did not have the urge to propagate , the species would not survive . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and copulate , and have children , he says . He has had three wives , seven children . Copulate , and procreate . <p> But soon , he says , his voice rising to a thundering rumble , " there will be another way . " <p> This is Richard Seed , 69 , the bearded , grumpy , Bible-thumping , Harvard-educated physicist and fertility researcher who says he is going to open a human cloning clinic for childless couples . He estimates he is about $ 2 million and two years away from the first birth . He claims to have assembled a medical team . Four clients , he says , are on standby . <p> His announcement , made last month at a Chicago symposium on reproduction , exploded like heavy ordnance , with a bang and a shudder . To many , the prospect of human cloning  --  creating an embryo by duplicating the genetic material of one person  --  is profoundly troubling ; it creates life without love or physical communion , a narcissistic intrusion into the work of God . But until Seed came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientist Ian Wilmut produced a healthy cloned sheep last year in Scotland , President Clinton and some bioethicists pushed for a national ban on human cloning . They found little enthusiasm ; it was a complex issue , it seemed remote , and the scientific community was not of one mind . <p> Then , suddenly , the danger had a face . It was a scary face . Forbidding . Mephistophelean . Its eyes smoldered . When it spoke , it growled . <p> For those who would want to demonize human cloning , this was too good to be true . <p> The demon Seed . <p> He was defiant . He was rude . When the president said he would move to prevent the cloning of humans , Seed responded that he would simply move his operation to Tijuana , Mexico . When Clinton suggested , through a spokesman , that Seed was irresponsible and unethical , the physicist said of the president , " As far as I am concerned , he 's slick , sleazy Willy . " <p> Overnight , it seemed , efforts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . House Majority Leader Dick Armey ( R-Tex. ) decried the prospect of " a Brave New World of sidewalk cloning clinics . " A member of the president 's bioethics commission likened Dr. Seed to two other doctors : Kevorkian and Frankenstein . The ramifications of human cloning were examined ad nauseam in the national media , down to the specter of genetically manipulated , headless human fetuses being farmed for their organs . <p> Meanwhile , people who knew Seed were plainly mystified . <p> " He 's nuts ! " says Dick Seed , 37 , a graphic designer from Truro , Mass . Dick is Richard 's son . <p> " He 's nuts , but he 's creative , " said Robert Seed , 23 , a computer programmer in Chicago . Robert is also Richard 's son . <p> " You can imagine my amusement when I saw the president of the United States responding to this person , " says Mary Walters , laughing . " I felt like I was in the Twilight Zone . " <p> Walters was Richard Seed 's next-door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ill. , historic district , a neighborhood famous for its Frank Lloyd Wright architecture . The house Seed and his wife lived in stands vacant these days , dark and windswept . The new owner appears to be gutting it , " thank goodness , " says Walters . <p> Seed lost it to foreclosure last summer , after living there 12 years with his third wife , Gloria . Once comfortably well off , he says he is " out of money . " <p> " Bad investments , " he says , pacing the living room of the small house he lives in now in this Chicago suburb . He consults his watch . He 's a busy man with many important appointments . How long will this take ? <p> This is not about his personal life anyway , he says sourly . What does his personal life have to do with whether he can pull this cloning thing off ? <p> Human cloning is inevitable , he says . <p> " If not me , then someone else . If not here , then somewhere else . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that , with grand flourishes and hints of mystery . He will not disclose the names of his partners in this venture , not the nurse , not the embryologist , and certainly not the **25;304;TOOLONG , a man he calls " my obie-gynie . " <p> " If I did , " he says , noting the furor that swirls around him , " his business would be ruined . " <p> " Neither of us likes to lie , but I have told him to lie , to deny any connection with me if he is asked . " <p> So there is no way of confirming that he has any allies at all ? <p> " Correct . " <p> The Seeds of Oak Park are an intellectual and accomplished family . Richard Seed is the son of a prominent Chicago surgeon who , in the 1930s , helped pioneer blood banking . Seed 's brother Randolph is a doctor , and so is his brother John . Richard went into physics , earned three degrees at Harvard , and all his life teetered on the brink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He may have had the scientific skills of a Fermi , and the entrepreneurial instincts of a Carnegie , but he also had the attention span of a toddler . <p> In the 1950s , he began a semiconductor business in his basement . Few people had then heard of semiconductors , which would become the infrastructure of the computer industry . Seed left the company shortly before people made vast fortunes in semiconductors . <p> Then he was into gas lasers . Same thing . <p> " He has a problem with follow-through . He has no sense of closure , " says his son Russell , 34 , who lives in the Chicago area and once was in the mortgage business with his father until they had a falling-out . Richard was lousy at the mortgage business , says his son . The mortgage business , says Russell , " is about pushing papers from one side of the desk to another . It is not intellectual . There is no fun . " Richard got bored and careless , Russell says . He lost his money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with his brother Randolph , he ran Embryo Transplant Corp. , which developed advanced reproductive techniques to produce high-yield milk cows . Seed figured out a non-surgical procedure to super-ovulate the most productive cows , and then wash the embryos out of the uterus to be implanted in other cows . From one " super cow , " as many as 12 super calves could be born . It was an ingenious idea , and it worked , but Seed 's company went bust because it depended on the financial health of the farming industry at a time when agribusiness was in trouble . <p> " We were n't too sharp , business-wise , " Randolph once told the Associated Press . <p> Seed was undeterred : He figured the egg-washing procedure would work on humans . A doctor would remove an embryo from a fertile donor and transfer it to an infertile woman client , who would carry the baby . No surgery would be necessary . Working with his brother Randolph , he got funding in a public stock offering and formed Fertility &; Genetics Research Inc. in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50,000 procedures a year , thousands of bouncing babies . Instead , there were three . The technique proved more difficult than Seed had anticipated . " There were technical problems , " he says . Eggs did n't wash as easily out of humans as they did out of cows . In vitro fertilization  --  the surgical procedure that produced the world 's first test-tube baby in 1978  --  became the state of the art . <p> Fertility &; Genetics Research went belly up . Next , Seed showed up one day in the late 1980s in the office of Walter Cornett , a venture capitalist in Glenview , Ill . The first thing Seed told Cornett was that he , Seed , was " the smartest man in the world . " The second thing he said was that he had a secret plan to corner the world 's market on fish meal . All he needed was $ 35 million . <p> " I thought he was a couple of bubbles off plumb , " Cornett says . <p> Cornett listened , though . Seed had done his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coast trash fish harvested for its oil . After the oil was extracted , the rest of the fish was ground up and sold cheaply for fish-meal fertilizer and animal feed . Seed had learned that there were only seven small , struggling fishing fleets that caught all of the menhaden , and he proposed secretly buying up them all , and then bumping fish-meal prices through the roof . <p> Cornett did n't nibble . He did n't have the money . <p> " You know , " he says today , " it was not a farfetched idea . It might have worked . " <p> But Seed never pursued it . Instead , he went into mortgage banking with his son . Lost his shirt . <p> By and large , the scientific community has been contemptuously dismissive of Richard Seed , a research scientist who has gone 10 years without a significant research project . The consensus seems to be that human cloning may someday be possible , that it may indeed be inevitable , but that Seed will not be the man to do it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amused that everyone says cloning humans will be fraught with peril . Humans are much easier to clone than sheep or cows , he contends . <p> The refinement of in vitro fertilization techniques , he says , has made human cloning a relatively safe and simple procedure . Ultrasound probes into the vagina make the extraction and implantation of eggs simple and accurate , he says . <p> What about the possibility of error in human cloning ? Ian Wilmut had 276 failures before Dolly the sheep was born . Some of them were grotesque . Fetuses grew monstrously large . Fetuses were deformed . Fetuses had to be discarded . Wilmut has said he would anticipate similar problems with humans . <p> He 's wrong , says Seed . <p> " My solution is DNA fingerprinting before transfer . " He explains : The same technique used by forensic scientists to catch criminals can be used to make sure that the genetic material of the donor and the clone are identical . " You look at those long pages of dots and make sure they are identical . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is impossible to have chromosomal abnormalities . " <p> Can it possibly be that simple ? <p> He smiles . " Maybe these guys have n't thought of it yet . " <p> The phone keeps ringing . Seed keeps peevishly checking his watch . Appointments await . <p> " You are clearly not as intelligent as I am , you recognize that , do n't you ? " <p> This comes out of nowhere . Is he joking ? <p> " You do n't think as fast as I do . " <p> He is not joking . <p> " You do n't use words as large as I do . " <p> The doctor does not lack for self-esteem . <p> " I am a near genius , " he says , and then corrects himself . " I am a former near genius . " <p> A former near genius ? <p> He does not elaborate . <p> The doorbell rings . Seed rises to answer it . <p> " Doctor , I have seen you on TV and I have great respect for the work you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a shuffle of papers . <p> " I am Anthony . . . and I have something I would like you to read . " <p> Anthony is small and pudgy and earnest . He proffers a document . <p> " The federal government is illegally using microscopic technology on me , " he says . " They made me consume something that can communicate to your neurons with electrical impulses . The federal government is committing this crime against me . I am having problems getting this recognized by the state police because it makes people look like they are mentally ill . It mimics schizophrenia , and I am hoping you can help me . " <p> Seed graciously agrees to look at the material . <p> When Anthony is gone , Seed smiles sadly and spins a finger in circles against his temple . There are many things about which he is cynical , and he is contemptuous of people who he feels are of inferior intellect , but he is not making fun of the visitor at the door . <p> " I try to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people 's feelings . " <p> He knows what it is like to be called a madman . <p> Seed has some secrets . As the hours pass , he dribbles them out . The first is his " secret number . " It is 200,000 , and it is what he predicts is the total yearly market for human clones in the United States . The infertility market , he says , is relatively small , only 3,000 sterile couples a year . Where will the other 197,000 customers come from ? <p> " People with strong egos , who want to clone themselves . " <p> People like Richard Seed ? <p> " Yes . " <p> Will he clone himself ? <p> " Yes . " <p> A second secret appears to involve payment of a gratuity to a sovereign state . Richard Seed says that if he is forced to go to Mexico , his start-up costs will rise from $ 2 million to about $ 2.5 million . <p> " I do n't disapprove of bribes , " he says matter-of-factly . " We can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world . " <p> He says he would also set up a free medical clinic in a poor part of Tijuana " to buy goodwill . Then they 'd have a hard time tossing me out of town . " <p> He leans back in his chair , then sits bolt upright . " Hey , what if I put up a free medical clinic in the Chicago Housing Authority ? This is worth thinking about ! " He makes a mental note . <p> The phone keeps ringing , unanswered . <p> Seed 's third secret is a secret fantasy . He envisions a cure for cancer through cloning . <p> The nuclei of breast cancer cells , he says , look normal in the early stages of the disease , and later get deformed . He proposes taking new cancer cells , in this early stage of development , and putting their nuclei in other cells . You let them divide and grow  --  essentially the same process as cloning  --  and see if you get something without cancer . <p> " Then you will have reprogrammed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he says . " You would not have cured this cancer , you would have cured all cancer . " <p> But what will you have created ? What if you get something grotesque ? <p> " A lumpy beast ? " Seed asks , laughing . <p> Yes . A monster . <p> " Well , if it is a lumpy beast without cancer , you are still 90 percent of the way there ! It would be astonishing , biologically . " <p> But what would you do with the monster ? <p> " I 'd freeze and store it , " he says . <p> See ? No problem . <p> Seed is dismissive of most ethical objections to cloning . He gives an example : <p> His clinic is going to serve infertile couples . Because a clone is the genetic copy of one person only , the first baby born to a client would be a genetic duplicate of either the father or the mother . Then the couple would come back , a year or two later , and duplicate the other parent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one boy and one girl . <p> These children would grow up as brother and sister in the same household , but they would have no genetic material in common . They would be little genetic duplicates of their father and mother . <p> Now , what if they fell in love , just as their father and mother did ? What if they married ? <p> " Some people think that would be horrible , " Seed says . " I do n't see anything wrong with it . " You have to be a scientist , he says . You have to define incest genetically . <p> " I have a feeling clones wo n't marry , though . Brothers and sisters do n't like each other , you know . If you want them to fall in love , you would have to send them to separate boarding schools . It would be interesting to see , though I do n't think it would be a problem no matter how it comes out . <p> " Actually , I do n't like boarding schools . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are seven Seed children , five men and two women with three different mothers . They are scattered across the country . <p> " He 's stimulating , " says Russell of his father . " He is a loving , caring father , but he is not very good at expressing that . Not many of his children are as close to him as I am , and I am not very close to him . " <p> Says son Robert : " Me and him , when we talk , we pretty much only talk about science . " <p> Seed admits he can seem cold and clinical . Not to mention insufferable . " Can you imagine listening to me 24 hours a day ? " Sometimes , he says , his wife will go to the bathroom just to get away from his hectoring . <p> " I 'll follow her in , because I was n't finished . " <p> It is evidently impossible to live with Richard Seed and not be exasperated with him , and impressed by him in spite of yourself . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does Russell Seed . So does Dick Seed , even though he has seen his father only a few times in the past 25 years . Richard left when he was 10 . <p> And so does Zaroohy Seed , Richard Seed 's second wife . They were were married in 1960 , divorced in 1972 . <p> Zaroohy calls her ex-husband " dynamic , ambitious and interesting . " Also completely maddening . <p> What does he want ? <p> " Money , " she says . He gets money , then excretes it " right down the toilet . " <p> That 's it ? Money ? <p> Money first , she says , then scientific challenge and , finally , immortality . <p> " He once wanted to be preserved cryogenically , can you believe that ? I would have pulled the plug . " <p> The former Mrs. Richard Seed pauses to let this sink in . <p> " I 'd have not paid the electric bill , and quietly let the lights go off . And that would be that . " <p> In his living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is convinced , is part of God 's plan . Beside his chair is the Good News Bible , a modern translation of Scripture . Seed is a devout Methodist . <p> " In the first two chapters of the Old Testament , we learned that God made man in his own image . He intended the union of man and God . Is this union spiritual or in body ? I think it is talking about the body . That we would become God in body and spirit . " <p> Cloning is the first step , Seed says . The second step is manipulation of the genetic material to reset the human body clock , to end the aging of cells . " Indefinite life extension , " he calls it . Man becomes God . <p> But for the moment , he will have to be content with more conventional avenues of immortality . Copulation . Procreation . Family . The immortality that comes with memory . <p> Seed 's living room is sparsely furnished . By far the most imposing feature is a pair of lighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are filled , top to bottom , with earrings . There are perhaps 800 pairs of earrings , row upon row , neatly arranged , hanging from bars . Some are delicate , some are ungainly , some are expensive , but most seem like costume items , plain and cheap . This is not a particularly valuable collection , except to Richard Seed . They were his mother 's earrings . It is her shrine . <p> " See that beautiful woman ? " he says , pointing to a framed portrait amid the earrings , hand-tinted in the manner of the 1930s . Frances Seed was indeed an elegant woman . <p> " My mother was a minor socialite and a lady  --  you never heard her say a foul word in her entire life , " Seed says . " She was a very interesting woman . She never struck us . Maybe a tap on the hand . <p> " My mother did n't know us , " he continues , his voice softening . " My brother and I spent our childhood torturing each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the window , jump off the second floor ! She did n't know who we were . She thought we were just ruffians who tore through the house . <p> " My father was the last of the Victorians . He was very proper . He would never use an improper word . He was a good father , but he had no demonstrable affection for his children . We used to drive him nuts . One of my favorite games was to sneak up behind him when he was reading the Sunday paper , like a lion cub , and bat the paper out of his hands . It is a very startling thing when that happens . . . . <p> " I never saw my father ill , and then he up and died of prostate cancer . " <p> Seed has prostate problems himself . <p> He trails off . <p> " I had an almost idyllic childhood , " he says . <p> And then life got very , very complicated . <p> " I am disappointed at my achievements , " he says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have all that much to show for it . He gave me creative and inventive abilities . Robert Noyce was at MIT when I was at Harvard . He 's the inventor of the integrated circuit . I consider myself more competent than Noyce . But he made an enormous contribution , and I have n't . " <p> Above all , he says , he regrets not winning a Nobel Prize . He always wanted to win one , and now , he says , it is too late . <p> Too late ? <p> " You lose a lot of brain cells as you get older , " he says . He is not complaining , he is speaking clinically , like a scientist . <p> This would explain why he is a former near genius ? <p> " Right , " he says . <p> " You get dumber and dumber , " he says . " Your body gets weaker and weaker , too . But that is not as frightening . " <p> The public unraveling of Richard Seed began shortly after he burst into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chicago Tribune revealed his financial troubles , his unsuccessful business schemes , his grandiose posturings . The Tribune also spoke of an old criminal charge against Seed , something from 1990 allegedly involving medical malpractice . The newspaper did not obtain the records , and Seed would not discuss it . His silence seemed damning . He said he was protecting someone who would be hurt by the disclosure . To the cynic , that someone seemed to be Seed himself . <p> To this day , Seed has continued to refuse to talk about this incident . <p> The records are in the Chicago criminal courts . This was one of the few things the Tribune got wrong . The case had nothing to do with malpractice . People involved remember it well . <p> On July 19 , 1990 , Richard Seed and his wife , Gloria , brought their younger daughter to a private hospital . She was 14 or 15 . She was distraught . She was threatening suicide . A hospital psychiatrist ordered her held for observation and treatment , against her parents ' wishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ambulance arrived to transport the girl to a state mental facility , apparently because the Seeds were uninsured . <p> Not only was she not going home , she was being sent to a place not known for the quality of its care , a facility that Seed considered a snake pit . <p> He tried to place himself between the ambulance and his daughter . <p> There were shouts , and a scuffle . Seed was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct . Eventually the case was dismissed . The daughter was treated and released . She is 21 now , and doing okay . <p> One hospital employee who was at the scene remembers a tall , dignified man , welldressed , half crazy with fear and humiliation , fiercely fighting to protect his child . <p> " I could understand why he did it . I could definitely understand . I might have done the same thing . " <p> Because he understands genetics , Richard Seed is confident he 's got maybe a quarter-century left in him . He has the genes for long life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nineties . <p> Before he dies , he expects to be cloned , but , he says , that will not be immortality : " It wo n't be me . " He 's right , of course . It wo n't be Richard Seed . It will be a baby boy who will grow up to be a whole lot like him . Ingenious . Arrogant . Impulsive . Obstinate . Irascible . Eccentric . Immature . Decent . Loving . Distant . Kind of sweet . Kind of sad . <p> But truth to tell , it probably wo n't happen . Few people other than Seed figure humans will be cloned that soon . The government is doing everything it can to see that he does n't move forward . The Food and Drug Administration last week announced it would have to license any procedure involving human cloning . Presumably , the approval process would take years and years . <p> So Richard Seed probably will die unduplicated , and , like the rest of us , he will probably live on the way we all live on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Seed is asked what he would most like out of life , now that the Nobel is beyond his reach . Does he want to be wealthy ? Respected ? Vindicated ? <p> Nothing he has said in the previous four hours prepares you for his answer . <p> " I would like all of my children to go to my funeral . " <p> That is all ? <p> " I would like them to say , ' He was my father , and I loved him . ' " <p> For once , Richard Seed 's composure breaks . The most dangerous scientist on Earth wipes away a tear .
