<p> LUBBOCK - The two most talked-about coordinator positions in Texas suddenly came open , and in a rare development , neither focus of attention resided in Austin or College Station . <p> There had been talk about Texas defensive coordinator Gary Darnell and Texas A &M; offensive coordinator Steve Ensminger the past few seasons . But the offensive coordinators at Texas Tech and Baylor received the most attention . <p> Tech 's Dick Winder was widely respected and constantly praised . Baylor 's Jack Crowe was harshly criticized and blamed too often for the Bears ' continued problems at quarterback . <p> Then both jobs suddenly became open . Winder joined John Blake 's staff at Oklahoma ; Crowe was fired . And both programs faced high-stakes decisions , with the results sure to be watched even more closely than were Winder and Crowe . <p> This is especially true because the hiring of the new coordinators could not have been more different . At Tech , as soon as recruiting ended , Spike Dykes promoted his son Rick , who had been the running backs coach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father'a tenure - James Gray , Bam Morris and Byron Hanspard . <p> Dykes cited Rick Dykes ' role in Tech 's offensive success and pointed to the continuity on his staff . But the pressure will be on any coach succeeding Winder , especially one sharing a last name with the head coach . <p> " " I think continuity , if you have any degree of success , is tremendously important , " Spike Dykes said . " " If you 're struggling , sometimes you want to have dramatic changes . We 've been extremely pleased . Dick did a great job . He 's a fantastic football coach . But a lot of people were a part of that team . " <p> At Baylor , the transition has been anything but smooth . Baylor coach Chuck Reedy fired Crowe but chose not to announce the move to allow Crowe to land his next job before having to publicly deal with losing one at Baylor . David Culley , the former A &M; assistant cut loose in Sam Wyche 's dismissal in Tampa Bay , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announcement . <p> But this week , Culley officially moved on , joining the Pittsburgh Steelers ' staff . And with the start of spring football just two weeks away , Reedy is out looking again . <p> " " I thought we had the situation resolved , " Reedy said . " " It worked out exactly how we planned with David Culley . One of the reasons we waited so long was to get through the Senior Bowl and all those things to eliminate the possibility he 'd remain in the pros . <p> " " It was disappointing to get it resolved and have him leave . <p> But if you hire good people , other people will want to hire them . " <p> They usually wait , however , until he unpacks . <p> Instead , the advantages that come with continuity are out of the question . And they are not insignificant . For years , A &M; was able to keep its staff together . After a few SWC titles , the carpet got worn out with coaches leaving to the NFL or other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the NFL , three with college head-coaching positions and two with high-profile coordinator jobs at Michigan and Notre Dame . Those numbers make the next hire easier , but keeping a good staff together works far better . <p> " " It 's very helpful , " Slocum said . " " It 's a positive thing in recruiting . Guys learn recruiting areas and the people there . <p> And it helps coaches to really know , to have an understanding , a clear picture of the philosophy and vision of a program . <p> That 's the biggest thing . " <p> Change , Slocum said , helps prevent staffs from becoming stagnated . And there will be changes at Baylor and Tech . <p> Baylor will seek to pass more effectively . Tech will likely go even more toward the no-huddle offense that worked so well in the Copper Bowl . <p> And both will be watched very closely , if for very different reasons . <p> Around the league <p> I 'm bad , I 'm nationwide - For years , Texas A &M; prided itself on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A &M; players were from Texas , nine from out of state . Of this season 's recruiting class of 19 , only three players were from out of state , two of those a drive away in Louisiana . <p> But A &M; coach R.C. Slocum says it is time to branch out . Slocum noted that Michigan played a bowl game in San Antonio ( its Alamo Bowl loss to A &M); and Colorado played a bowl game in Dallas ( its Cotton Bowl win against Oregon ) and then followed those forays into Texas by combining to pull eight top players out of the state . <p> Slocum said with all the top programs looking wherever top players can be found , A &M,; now also recognized nationally , will step up national recruiting . <p> " " The increased academic requirements have effectively shrunk the pool of players that are not only good enough athletically to play at the level we play but good enough academically , " Slocum said . " " If you look at college football , everybody has that problem . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also other states , recruiting . <p> " " It is out of necessity . Our base will be here in Texas . We 'll try to do the same job in Texas we always have but we have to look outside our boundaries now . We have positioned ourselves to go out and have a realistic chance to recruit some of these players . We can go into California , and those kids are very familiar with Texas A &M."; <p> How to make a million - Incentives agreed upon by Texas football coach John Mackovic and school officials could earn Mackovic close to $ 1 million for a dream season . <p> A national championship , which would include Big 12 South and conference title-game championships along the way , would earn Mackovic $ 350,000 in bonuses , $ 200,000 for the national title and $ 75,000 each for the division and championship-game titles . <p> There are also some graduation-rate bonuses on top of Mackovic 's $ 600,000 base salary . <p> " " Just a handful of coaches win national championships , " Texas athletic director DeLoss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ championship , that 's what he should get . " <p> Bump on the road - One of the more interesting scenes of the basketball season followed Texas ' game Sunday at TCU . <p> Long after the game and postgame interviews had been completed , Texas coach Tom Penders was in the hallway between the home and visitors locker rooms talking with point-guard recruit Anthony Goode from Dallas Carter . <p> Goode signed with Texas before the season , making the contact permissible . <p> Meanwhile , Goode 's teammate , junior center Lamar Wright , was speaking at length with TCU assistant coach Richard Bacon . This is also allowed because Wright was visiting TCU 's home game . Wright eventually made his way to where Penders and Goode were talking and moved into the NCAA 's gray area of a " " bump . " Conversation was brief and limited to little more than hellos . <p> But when TCU coach Billy Tubbs finally left his locker room , he sternly barked a warning to Penders about improperly talking to Wright . <p> Tubbs later said he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed very serious at the time . <p> Penders followed Tubbs toward the interview room saying , " " It 's a bump , a bump Billy . " Penders even followed Tubbs to the interview room to talk further about it . <p> Although " " bumps " often become bones of contention , the scene will not amount to anything else , especially because Penders had to be in the hallway , having had a game there that day . <p> But it should make next season 's recruiting battle for Wright more interesting . <p> Help wanted - In guard Tommy McGhee and center Shaun Igo , Rice has two of the SWC 's top five scorers ; the two are averaging a combined 38.6 points per game . The next best scoring duo , Tech 's Jason Sasser and Cory Carr , average a combined 34.7 points per game . <p> But McGhee and Igo are the only Rice scorers in double figures , and only freshman Robert Johnson , averaging 9.4 points per game , is close . Rice 's fourth-leading scorer , J.J. Polk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last in the SWC among third and fourth scorers , 4.5 points behind the average . <p> " " Part of the frustration they ( Igo and McGhee ) have is they do n't have a lot of guys that take advantage of scoring opportunities to take pressure off those guys , " Rice coach Willis Wilson said . " " Some of those guys have to step up and score for us . This is usually the time of year in our program we find third and fourth guys to be consistent , not to score big numbers , but consistent numbers in the 8-12 range . <p> That 's what we need now . " <p> Also notable : The last time Rice made half its shots or better in a game was in its win at Texas to open the conference season . <p> Hill-acious week - Texas Tech 's Jason Sasser and Baylor 's Brian Skinner were the SWC 's picks to share Player of the Week honors . Skinner had 56 points , 23 rebounds and five blocked shots in two games and made 23 of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against TCU and A &M; <p> But numbers like those posted by Sasser and Skinner are expected . The player of the week when it comes to grabbing unexpected attention and inspiring conversation was Texas ' Lamont Hill . <p> Hill is a former walk-on whose absence was barely noticed when he sat out last season . Before the season , he was largely known only as former Duke guard Thomas Hill 's brother . <p> But in the past three games , Hill has twice posted his career best of 16 points , then shattered that personal record with 26 at TCU . In the past three games , he has averaged 19.3 points , making 58.1 percent of his shots overall and 58.3 percent of his 3-pointers . <p> And in the past two games , he held Rice 's Tommy McGhee and TCU 's Jeff Jacobs to 11 points each . <p> The last word - SMU coach Mike Dement on rebuilding : " " Unfortunately , this is extremely parallel to the first year of a program I took over in North Carolina . That was almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and everything else . <p> " " It 's like a train is coming , I 've seen it coming , and it keeps coming , and it hits me every day . And I 've been through it before . " <p> The future is now <p> We were not nuts early this season when ranking Missouri high in the Big 12 , just prophetic . The upset of Kansas was not a fluke . Well , not all fluke , anyway . Texas is also making a move in the Big 12 , and it was easy to tell the Longhorns went into Wednesday 's game with a three-game winning streak . Texas coach Tom Penders was talking about the polls and Texas voters again . " " We 're even getting respect in the polls , " he said , " " although I do n't think we got a vote in Texas . " True , but moving to sixth in our Big 12 list is a far greater honor . <p> WAC Big 12C-USA . <p> 1 . UtahKansasCincinnati . <p> 2 . Fresno St.Texas TechMemphis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
