" It 's always something " is the unofficial anthem of mothers who work . If it 's not a sick child or a snow day or a workplace that has hardly flexed despite the fact that 68% of women with children younger than 18 work , it 's an ex-husband using your career to try to take the kids away . Mothers with high-powered jobs like Marcia Clark , the prosecutor in the O.J. Simpson case , may have the most to worry about . In a flurry of recent custody battles , women who do n't conform to the Donna Reed notion of motherhood have lost custody to men who slightly exceed Homer Simpson 's idea of fatherhood . <P> As she heads to court this week to contest her estranged husband 's petition for custody of the couple 's two young boys , Clark should take heed of a similar case decided last fall in Washington . The fact that Clark is up early with the children and manages to get home and tuck them into bed most evenings before returning to the courthouse may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incompatible with mothering . It was not enough for Sharon Prost , deputy chief counsel of the Senate Judiciary Committee , whose ex-husband Kenneth Greene in 1994 won custody and $23,010 a year in child support . Prost told the court she rose at 5:30 a.m. daily to fix breakfast and drive the older child to school ; the younger came with her to Senate day care , where she had lunch with him and logged him out many days well before the 6 p.m. closing time . Her boss , Senator Orrin Hatch , testified that when the Senate was in recess , about half the year , he supported her going home early . A psychiatrist , chosen and seen by both parties , found that Greene , who had insisted that there be an au pair in the house even when he was unemployed for more than a year , was attentive to the children but that Prost was the primary caregiver who provided structure and discipline . The judge , however , gave great weight to the testimony of the au pair , who said Prost was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers when she was . <P> Prost filed a new affidavit last month in which she swore that she is still the primary caregiver for the children , except that now it is haphazard and at her husband 's discretion . Prost says she still drives them to school and day care , stays home when they are sick , arranges for their shots , buys their shoes and goes along on field trips and to soccer practice . She does all the kids ' laundry , which is dropped off along with them . Greene disagrees but is not required to respond to matters already decided at trial . <P> Some of these suits seem to be more about money and revenge than about the children . Gordon Clark did not sue for custody until Marcia Clark asked for more child support . The willingness of the courts to let young children be used as poker chips may be one more bow to the Angry White Male . But the signals from the new majority are mixed : work is bad when it takes the professional mother away from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave her children for a job at a minimum wage that she will then owe to whoever watches them .
