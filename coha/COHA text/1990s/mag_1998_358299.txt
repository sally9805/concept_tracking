Extraordinary claims , scientists like to say , require extraordinary proof , and none has been more extraordinary in recent years than Scottish embryologist Ian Wilmut 's claim that he and his colleagues had cloned a sheep named Dolly from a mammary cell of a pregnant ewe . More than a year later , nobody has managed to reproduce the Dolly experiment , and Wilmut is under growing pressure to prove that his famous sheep is what he says she is . Last week at a genetics meeting at the University of Louisville , in Kentucky , he blandly conceded that there was a " remote possibility " that there could have been a mix-up  --  that Dolly could turn out to be the clone not of the adult ewe , but of the fetus the ewe was carrying . <P> So does that mean all the cloning hoopla Dolly set off was for naught ? Not quite . What Wilmut is conceding is that Dolly 's mom  --  or should we say her twin sister ?  --  probably had some fetal cells circulating in her bloodstream , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found its way into the laboratory culture from which Dolly sprang . Cloning an embryo from a fetal cell , of course , would not be as big a deal . What made the Dolly experiment so extraordinary was that Wilmut had managed to get the DNA of an adult cell to revert to its early embryonic state , opening the door to the cloning of a cell from full-grown human , say , a Michael Jordan or a Bill Gates . <P> Wilmut last week put the chances that Dolly was some sort of fetal-cell contamination at less than a million to one . Nonetheless , he and his colleagues are scrambling to track down any other tissue samples taken from Dolly 's mom so they can perform the genetic tests that will determine , once and for all , if Dolly 's DNA and her mom 's DNA are identical . <P> Meanwhile , scientists trying to make another Dolly  --  or her bovine equivalent  --  have come intriguingly close . For example , James Robl , at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst , and his colleague Steven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken from a big , hoofed cow leg supplied by a local slaughterhouse . So far they 've cloned hundreds of cells and nurtured dozens into embryos , but to date none of those embryos has survived past 60 days of gestation . <P> Why should cloning an adult cell be so hard ? The cell-cloning technique scientists use offers some clues . Typically , the nucleus of the donor cell , whether fetal or full grown , is transferred to an unfertilized egg from which the nucleus has been removed . In mysterious ways scientists still do not understand , something in the cytoplasm of the egg appears to reset the donor cell 's DNA . That resetting , it has been clear from the beginning , works much less reliably when adult cells are used , even when they are relatively immature fibroblast cells . <P> But this comes as no surprise , says Stice , the chief scientist for Advanced Cell Technology in Worcester , Mass . After all , it took Wilmut 's team 400 tries to create Dolly . Others attempting to reproduce the experiment could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in other words , may turn out to be a fluke , not a fake . No matter what she is , it 's looking less and less likely that we 're going to see clones of Bill Gates or Michael Jordan anytime soon . <P>  --  By J. Madeleine Nash
