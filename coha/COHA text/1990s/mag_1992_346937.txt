- Movies may have been his downfall , but that does n't mean ex-Washington Mayor MARION BARRY will turn his back on them , especially when one will feature his life story . Barry has visited Tinseltown for a meeting with producer Ron Samuels , who wants to make a film that will highlight events in Barry 's life such as the civil rights movement and his spell in jail . " He has had a fascinating life , " says Samuels . It all is on hold until after D.C. 's Sept. 15 election , when Barry could return to public office by winning a city council seat . If he does , Samuels says , it would make the movie " even more of a Rocky story . "
