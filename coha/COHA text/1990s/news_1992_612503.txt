<p> With great hoopla , American corporations are entering into all sorts partnerships with local public schools . <p> They are awarding cash grants to excellent teachers , donating computers to classrooms and urging corporate employees to tutor slow learners . They are giving college scholarships to deserving high school seniors and advising principals and superintendents about efficient management . <p> Some of these efforts are useful . Others are little more than public- relations gimmicks. but even the best of them is a scatter-shot approach to dealing with the core educational problem in America : the growing number of young , unskilled workers whose incomes continue to plummet . <p> High schoolers who get college degrees are not part of the problem . America 's college grads are actually becoming more competitive in the new global economy . During the 1980s their earnings rose 10 percent , as the world market paid a steadily higher rate for people with innovative ideas and problem-solving skills . <p> But unskilled workers without college degrees are becoming less competitive . Indeed , routine production is being moved to areas of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fraction of the U.S. price . The earnings of workers with only high school diplomas dropped 9 percent in the 1980s and the earnings of dropouts plunged 12 percent . <p> It 's becoming a vicious cycle . Employers are reluctant to train non- supervisory employees in basic skills because it 's often cheaper to automate the job or do the work overseas . But before it 's too late , American business must launch a coordinated national strategy to rescue non-college-bound youth . <p> Here are eight guidelines for businesses to follow : <p> 1 . Give to public elementary and high schools , not strictly to prestigious private colleges . <p> Of the $ 2.6 billion contributed by U.S. corporations to education in 1989 ( the last year for which data are available ) only $ 248 million went to support public schools . That 's a bit under 10 percent . The rest of the money went to colleges and universities - especially America 's most prestigious private colleges and preparatory schools , both of which the firms ' top executives were likely to have attended . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already well- positioned to thrive in the 90 's global economy . Less likely to succeed are many of the kids now in public elementary and secondary schools . Businesses should heed this difference . <p> 2 . Look beyond schools where the firm is based or where its labs and factories are . These may not be the schools whose kids are in the greatest danger of dropping out or failing to gain basic skills . <p> Indeed , as U.S corporations continue to shift their headquarters and labs to well-heeled corporate research parks outside the cities , the nearby public schools are likely to have advantaged children whose parents are managerial , professional and technical workers . Moreover , these school districts are likely to have relatively healthy tax bases . Less likely partners are schools in poor rural townships or working-class urban areas . <p> 3 . Do n't starve the public schools by demanding steep tax breaks from the community . <p> These days , few self-respecting chief financial officers expect to pay the same rate of property tax as local residents . It 's easy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials that without tax incentives the firm 's factory wo n't locate there . Or , if the factory is already there , that it will leave . <p> As a result of such bidding , businesses now contribute a far smaller proportion of local taxes than they once did . In 1957 businesses paid about 45 percent of local revenues ; in 1989 around 16 percent . <p> But because families in many industrial communities ca n't afford to make up the difference , the quality of public education , as well as other municipal services , suffers . Yet these areas have the very schools where the proportion of non-college-bound kids is typically high . <p> Businesses in Wichita , Kan. , for example , donated more than $ 1 million to the public schools , but simultaneously got $ 1.6 million in tax breaks from the city . A successful effort by General Motors to cut by $ 2 million its annual taxes in Tarrytown , N.Y. , where the firm has had a factory since 1914 , has forced the town to lay off dozens of teachers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Offer apprenticeships in jobs that will await high school graduates . <p> All too often , non-college-bound high school students are dumped into vocational-education classes that are little more than holding bins , irrelevant to real-world jobs . What students need most is technical training under the guidance of skilled employees in apprenticeship programs carefully designed to supplement classroom work . <p> Sixty percent of western Germany 's 18-year-olds - virtually all who will not go on to college - are enrolled in apprenticeship programs . They split their time between academic subjects in school and training with qualified corporate staff . While apprenticed , the teenagers receive a learner 's wage . After they successfully complete an exam , they get a certificate that is recognized by employers as signifying minimum proficiency in a certain technical area . <p> 5 . Give summer jobs to high schoolers . <p> Most young people have little or no contact with the working world or the discipline it takes . A summer job can be a vital link to mentors who provide advice and guidance all the way to graduation . The summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is completed . <p> 6 . Hire students for full-time jobs directly out of high school . <p> American corporations often want employees to have some college or post-secondary vocational training before they are hired - even for non- technical jobs . But often this adds a new , unnecessary hurdle . It may discourage countless young people who might otherwise finish high school , but lack the patience and resources to stick it out another few years beyond graduation . <p> Usually the requirement is meant to ensure that new employees have basic standards literacy and numerical ability . A better way is for businesses to rely on standardized literacy and numeracy tests that high school seniors can take voluntarily . <p> 7 . Base hiring decisions on overall school performance . <p> Non-college-bound students often fail to apply themselves in high school because they do n't see any link between school performance and a good job after graduation . That 's because companies rarely check on high school performance when it 's time to make hiring decisions . They do n't seek grade reports or consult with teachers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high schools in Japan - even relying on them to select the students to be hired . Japanese students know their school performance is critical to their futures . <p> 8 . Train non-college employees . <p> American corporations claim to spend almost $ 30 billion a year on employee training . But most of it goes to college graduates . As a result , non-college graduates are often stuck in dead-end jobs with no hope for promotion and little employment security . <p> In other nations , private businesses spend more to train non- supervisory workers . France requires employers to dedicate 1.2 percent of their total wage outlay to such training . Anything short of this is paid out as a tax to support a system of national technical education . <p> It may be more dramatic to donate computers to classrooms . But taken together , these eight principles offer a way for corporate America to make a profound impact on the nation 's children who are most at risk of failing in the new economy . <p> Robert B.
