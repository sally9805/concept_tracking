Why are Australia 's carnivores particularly coldblooded killers ? During ice ages , when sea level is low , Australia , Tasmania , New Guinea , and their smaller neighbors coalesce into a single great island . Dubbed Meganesia by scientists , this landmass covers an area of almost 4 million square miles and is a single geological entity , carried across the Southern Hemisphere by plate tectonics . Meganesian plants and animals thus share a common biological heritage , and even when the sea carves their great island homeland into discrete pieces , the flora and fauna retain their affinities . In addition to an abundance of marsupial , or pouched , mammals and a dearth of placental mammals , one of Meganesia 's most striking features is its extraordinary lack of large mammalian carnivores . This unusual situation is perhaps best illustrated by going back some 60,000 years , before the arrival of humans in Australia . At that time , Meganesia was home to approximately sixty species of mammals that weighed more than twenty pounds . Of these , not more than three were meat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other warmblooded carnivores weighed more than ten pounds , and they still survive : the Tasmanian devil and the spotted-tailed quoll . Each of these species fills , or filled , a somewhat different ecological niche . The Tasmanian devil , a scavenger and bone cruncher that takes whatever prey comes its way , is perhaps best described as a miniature marsupial hyena . Also a marsupial , the spotted-tailed quoll is weasel-like or civetlike in both appearance and in its stealthy behavior . The now-extinct thylacine ( which survived in Tasmania until 1936 ) was roughly the size and shape of a wolf and was Meganesia 's only doglike marsupial carnivore . Also extinct , the marsupial lion , one of the few carnivores to have arisen from herbivorous ancestors , had large , slicing premolars . This led some nineteenth-century scientists to speculate that it was a vegetarian that fed mainly on melons . But the discovery of a well-preserved fossil paw revealed that it was equipped with a big hooded claw , and the marsupial lion is now believed to have been an adept predator . Despite its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leopard than a lion and may have been the marsupial equivalent of the medium-sized cats on other continents . The marsupial giant rat kangaroo weighed a hefty ninety pounds and stood some four feet tall but had teeth similar to those of much smaller insectivores . This beast lived throughout eastern Australia  --  in woodland , grassy steppeland , and savanna  --  during the last ice age . Its ecology is enigmatic , however . It may well have been an omnivore , eating plants , scavenging carcasses , and opportunistically preying on bird eggs and small vertebrates . If such an interpretation of its diet and habits is correct , this primitive kangaroo may have filled a niche similar to that of some small bears . In the entire Australasian region , therefore , the broad carnivore niches were filled by just one mammal species each  --  doglike , catlike , civetlike , scavenging , and , possibly , bearlike animals . In contrast , even today the United States ( the lower forty-eight of which are roughly the size of Australia ) is inhabited by three bear species , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six species of weasels and their relatives , as well as raccoons , ringtails , and coatis . And the region 's abundance of carnivores pales when compared with its fauna during the Pleistocene , when dire wolves , various bears , jaguars , cheetahs , lions , and saber-tooths also roamed the continent . This diversity of mammalian carnivores is by no means exceptional ; Europe , Asia , Africa , and South America either did or still do support similarly diverse carnivore guilds . In all these regions , the broad cat and dog niches are subdivided according to size , prey type , and habitat , allowing many species to coexist . Biologists have long speculated on the cause of the imbalance in the Meganesian mammal fauna . One of the most important limitations known to affect carnivores is simply the size of the landmass they inhabit . Although Australia , which comprises the bulk of Meganesia , is indeed the smallest continent , it is still about 3 million square miles in area . Yet the Meganesian carnivore assemblage is not much richer than that of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Meganesia . Another school of thought holds that marsupials , having relatively small brains , were unable to evolve into successful predators . A quick look at the fossil record of South America , however , disproves the hypothesis that a connection exists between brain size and predation skill . Many species of doglike marsupials , ranging in size from bearlike to civetlike , lived in South America during the Tertiary period , about 65 to 2 million years ago . A remarkable subfamily of carnivorous marsupials evolved into catlike animals , resembling North American saber-tooths , that were capable of killing the largest of prey . The group that includes the ancestors of the American opossum also produced large flesh eaters . While all of these beasts became extinct when placental carnivores arrived in South America over the past 5 million years , they thrived for many millions of years , preying mainly upon large placental herbivores . Since there appears to be no intrinsic bar to carnivory in marsupials , perhaps the environment holds a clue to Meganesia 's paucity of large carnivorous mammals . Meat eaters sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus the most vulnerable of life forms to disturbances in the food chain . For example , an area of grassland that supports billions of individual grasses may sustain only a few thousand large herbivores . These , in turn , may be able to support fewer than one hundred large carnivores . If the environment is poor , large herbivores will be rare and thinly spread , and a critical point may be reached where the density of prey is so low that a population of large meat eaters can not be sustained . If further impoverished , such an environment can no longer support any large carnivores . Australia is notoriously infertile . An old continent with a stable geological history , it has experienced no widespread glaciation , mountain building , or volcanic activity  --  the forces that create new soil  --  over the past 50 million years . As a result of its quiet past , Australia is a land of old , thin , and leached soils . In the country 's semiarid zone , for example , soils have about half the levels of nitrates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality of arable land is another good measure of productivity , and even the 10 percent of Australia 's total land area that is considered arable is marginal when compared with other landmasses . Other indications of poor soil come from Australia 's plants , which have developed a variety of strategies , including slow average growth rates , to cope with the lack of nutrients . A contributing environmental factor is El Nino , or the Southern Oscillation cycle , which influences rainfall with a periodicity of roughly a decade . In some years , Australia receives high levels of rainfall , and productivity peaks , as it did in 1990 . But in El Nino years , such as 1992 , rainfall is reduced and prolonged droughts are likely . On no other continent does the cycle have such an extreme impact . Its effects can readily be seen in the high degree of nomadism and nonseasonal breeding in many Australian animals , particularly birds . When such variability is superimposed on a system that is already marked by low productivity , top-order carnivores are subject to exceptional stress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the region that even areas of rain forest lack big carnivores . The largest area of rain forest in Meganesia is in New Guinea , which is even more noteworthy than Australia for its lack of meat-eating mammals . Here we have no evidence of indigenous large catlike or scavenging predators . Before human settlement , New Guinea supported some two hundred species of rather small mammalian herbivores and insectivores , but was home to just one large warmblooded carnivore , the thylacine . Today , apart from humans , the largest predator is the bronze quoll , a two-pound , civetlike species . If large meat-eating mammals are disadvantaged in such a system , might animals that require less food and energy fare better ? Reptiles eat far less than mammals do , having no need to create inner body heat . They can survive long periods of food shortage and can exist at higher population densities than mammals , relative to their prey . Coldbloodedness thus becomes a great boon to survival . I believe this is what has happened in Meganesia , home to a remarkable array of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largest carnivores in the region were Wonambi , a 110-pound pythonlike snake with a 12-inch girth ; a giant land crocodile known as Quinkana : and a goanna  --  a kind of monitor lizard  --  called Megalania . Weighing as much as a ton , and more than twenty feet long , Megalania would have dwarfed present-day reptiles . Its nearest living relative is the Komodo dragon , which lives on a few small Indonesian islands adjacent to Australia . Although it weighs only a fraction as much as Megalania , the Komodo dragon is capable of killing goats , calves , and even humans . Megalania would have been powerful enough to subdue diprotodons , the rhinosized marsupial plant eaters that were the largest of all Australian mammals . Wonambi , the snake , occupied a far different ecological niche . It lived much farther south than large snakes do today and its remains are often found in rocks and caves . Its head was enormous ; its jaws filled with hundreds of tiny teeth . It may have fed upon wombat- and wallaby-sized mammals . The least well known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quinkana . It seems to have been quite independent of water . for its fossils have been found in caves that contain only remains of terrestrial species . Quinkana had a large , boxlike snout and compressed , serrated teeth . It may have competed with young Megalania for the now extinct kangaroos and smaller diprotodons . Are the climatic patterns of the Pleistocene and more recent times an aberration in the history of Meganesia ? Paleontological research suggests that during much of the " age of mammals . " and certainly since about 20 million years ago , Meganesia has been relatively resource poor and lacking in mammalian carnivores . On the other end of the spectrum , leading into historic times , Meganesia has been colonized by humans and , more recently , by animals introduced by them . How have the predators among them fared ? The number of humans in Meganesia since people first crossed the sea from Asia some 40,000 years ago remained small prior to European settlement . Adaptable and omnivorous , humans also became the top predators ; their hunting prowess probably led to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in size , including all of the land carnivores larger than the thylacine . The dog known as the dingo , introduced some 3,500 years ago , apparently drove both the thylacine and Tasmanian devil to extinction on the mainland . The success of other smaller , introduced predators such as the fox has been detrimental to native predators such as quolls . Humans , dingoes , and foxes have not caused a net increase in the number of mammalian carnivores in Meganesia ; they have simply replaced the few existing warmblooded carnivore species . But today , Australia , Tasmania , and New Guinea can still boast a rich supply of reptiles  --  ten species of goannas and a further ten species of pythons that weigh at least ten pounds . This remains a record number of sizable coldblooded carnivores . The case of the Meganesian meat eaters opens up new areas for exploration while reinforcing the view that because of its unusual climatic conditions and long isolation , Meganesia is truly a separate experiment in evolution . <p>            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
