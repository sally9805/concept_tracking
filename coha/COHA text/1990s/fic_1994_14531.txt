REMZI SABOURA The veil 's not the problem . You have n't been a virgin since you were thirteen . FAIROUZ SABOURA How dare you ! REMZI SABOURA I 'm sorry . FAIROUZ SABOURA I was at least fourteen ! ( They laugh . ) Mother still says to me : " The honor of a girl is like a piece of glass . If it 's broken , you can never glue it together again . " p. 22 REMZI SABOURA Why do n't you tell her the truth ? FAIROUZ SABOURA It 's my truth . Not hers . You hardly know her , and she lives five minutes away ! REMZI SABOURA I ca n't talk to her . FAIROUZ SABOURA Learn Arabic . REMZI SABOURA No . She should learn English . She 's been here over twenty years . FAIROUZ SABOURA She speaks English . She just wo n't . REMZI SABOURA You 're still doing the shopping for her , are n't you ?

They 're finally letting the women out of their houses to throw stones ? FAIROUZ SABOURA We throw stones . We run unions . We go to prison . We get shot . REMZI SABOURA Oh , martyrdom ! Why do n't you get out of the house and throw a few stones around here ! You 've got a big mouth , Fairouz , but your world is this small . I 'm sick of being a hyphen : the Palestinian , the gap between Arab-American . There 's room for me here . Where I have my friends . FAIROUZ SABOURA Ah , yes . Your friends . You tell your friends I was born that way . p. 24 REMZI SABOURA You 're going to blame me that no one wants to marry a girl with a gimpy foot . FAIROUZ SABOURA My foot is deformed , but my cunt works just fine ! REMZI SABOURA You have a mouth full of dirt , Sister . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want ? ( She speaks some angry lines to him in Arabic ) REMZI SABOURA Gibberish , Fairouz . Save it for the relatives . ( Fairouz speaks another line of Arabic to him . ) I 'm not a refugee . It 's always somewhere else with you , always once removed . I am not scattered . FAIROUZ SABOURA If I could go to war with you , I 'd shoot my enemies first , then I 'd shoot the ones who made them my enemies . REMZI SABOURA Enemies . Always the enemies . FAIROUZ SABOURA There are three kinds of people . Those who kill . Those who die . And those who watch . Which one are you , Remzi ? Which one are you ? I know . I know which one you are , do n't I ? REMZI SABOURA Go to hell . I was a kid . A child . You 'll never let it go , will you ? FAIROUZ SABOURA I just do n't want you to join up without knowing that sometimes I still hate you . p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desert in the past . Remzi and Craver are doing jumping jacks .

REMZI SABOURA The States . BOXLER I mean , where are your parents from ? REMZI SABOURA My father died when I was just a kid . My mother never told me where she was from . BOXLER Now that 's not nice Parents owe the knowledge of their roots to their sons . A root must know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ root living in the dark without a compass , and you have no idea what kind of tree is going to sprout forth from your skull . I 'd say , American Indian , maybe .

We 're all family here , are n't we ? CRAVER PERRY Do you know about the Sad Eyes , sir ? BOXLER Boxler 's my name . And of course I know about the Sad Eyes .

The creativity of it . ( Beat ) Shall we ? CRAVER AND REMZI Ready , sir . ( As Boxler speaks , he takes out a blindfold and puts it on . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's say you have a situation . A delicate situation . You 've taken an Iraqi prisoner . He has a secret , and you need to get this secret without breaking international law , the Geneva Constrictions , etc . Prisoners must be treated humanely . Please tie my hands behind my back . ( No response . ) Do as I tell you . Use your handkerchief . ( Remzi ties Boxler 's wrists . ) All right . Interrogate me . ( Neither Craver nor Remzi responds . ) Bang , crash ! Rat-tat-tat-tat ! Howl ! There are bullets flying all around you . This camel jockey knows where the reserve forces are located , and if they are n't destroyed you and your buddies are minced meat . ( Beat ) Interrogate me ! p. 27 REMZI SABOURA What 's your name ? I said : what 's your name ? He wo n't talk , Craver . What do we do ? BOXLER Be firm . CRAVER PERRY Tell us your name , shit bag , and we 'll go easy on you . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . BOXLER That 's an idea . Go on . ( Remzi pushes him , but not hard . ) That 's a start . ( Craver does so , but harder . ) You two Barbies , you think just because you push me around a little I 'm going to spill my guts ? You 're nothing but piss-ants with one hand tied behind your back . ( Craver shoves him , and he falls over . ) REMZI SABOURA One hand tied behind our backs ? ( He strikes Boxler . Craver strikes him , too . ) BOXLER You two dandelions are n't getting anywhere . Hey , baby doll , yeah you , the one with the dark skin , are you a half-breed ? REMZI SABOURA No . But you are . ( He kicks Boxler in the stomach ) You fucking sandnigger . BOXLER From what I can see of your face , you 're a sandnigger yourself . ( Remzi kicks Boxler again . ) What a farce : a sandnigger killing sandniggers . ( Remzi keeps kicking until Boxler lies still . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Did I hurt you , sir ? ( Boxler does n't move . ) CRAVER PERRY Oh shit . ( Remzi and Craver free Boxler 's wrists and uncover his eyes . Boxler springs to his feet , unharmed . ) BOXLER ( To Remzi ) : That was good . For a first time . ( Suddenly he punches Remzi in the stomach . He collapses . ) Pity is what you leave behind you , son , back home , tucked under your pillow with your teddy bear and girlie magazine . Now get to your feet , you stinking Arab . ( Remzi starts to get up , but Boxler pushes him over with his foot . Remzi attacks Boxler ; Boxler restrains him . ) That 's it . That 's it . Now hold on to it ! Hold on to that anger . Stoke it . Cuddle it , and when the right moment comes take aim and let it fly . A soldier without anger is a dead soldier . CRAVER PERRY What about me , sir ? BOXLER What about you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need it ? BOXLER Where are you from ? CRAVER PERRY Town of Hazard . Kentucky . Sir . BOXLER Let me see your teeth ? Hmmm .

BOXLER Burned to a crisp in an explosion ? CRAVER PERRY Suffocated . His lungs , sir . BOXLER A pity you were n't with him when he died . CRAVER PERRY It was like something sawing through wood . His breathing , sir . I could n't stand to hear it . But the Company would n't let him retire . He kept working . For the money , sir . We had to tie him into his chair to keep him at home . BOXLER Shat right there in his chair , did he ? And you let your mother clean up his mess . Never offered her a hand . Tsk , tsk . Went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ribbon . But one night you came home early , and he was still sitting there , tied to his chair . Your mother was passed out on the couch . REMZI SABOURA Sir , this is ridicu  --  BOXLER ( Interrupts ) : Yes , it is , is n't it ? Because Craver then leaned over and said into his father 's ear : " I 'm sorry , Dad . I am so sorry . " And do you know , Remzi , just what his father did to show his acceptance and respect for his prodigal son ? He pissed . Right then and there . Pissed where he sat , and Craver did n't even know it until he looked down and saw he was standing in it . The piss soaked through his shoes , right into his socks . p. 30 CRAVER PERRY When he went into the mines he was my father . When he came back out , he was something else . I could n't love something else . BOXLER And you were out fucking some pretty little box in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his last , painful breath . You shot your come the moment his heart stopped .

Are you a funny little boy , one of those ha-ha little boys ? CRAVER PERRY What are you going to do about it ? Report me ? I 'll break your fucking neck . REMZI SABOURA Let 's get out of here , Crave . ( Craver shoves Remzi away . ) BOXLER ( To Craver ) : My , my . I can call your father a broken-down , coal-shitting , piss-poor excuse for the American dream and you do n't bat an eye , but when I detect that you 're a bit on the queer side REMZI SABOURA Craver ? ( Craver suddenly turns on Remzi . They push each other . Craver knocks Remzi down and begins to choke Remzi . ) Craver ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Faggot . Shit-fucker . REMZI SABOURA Stop it ! Get off of me . BOXLER Sodomite . Fairy . ( Beat ) Feel it ? Feel it inside you , Mr. Perry ? Now grab hold of it . ( Boxler finally pulls Craver off of Remzi . ) Catch it . Hold it like a bullet between your teeth . And when the right moment comes , when you 've spotted your enemy , let it rip , my son . Let it rip . But remember , aim is everything and unbridled anger is of no use to you , it 's like crude oil : worthless without refinement . But you 've got to know where to direct it . Out there , my friend . Out there , in Indian territory , beyond the sand dunes where the camels lie in wait . Think of them as culprits in the death of your father . If the ragheads had n't shot our buffalo , we could have swapped them for their camels , and then we would n't have needed the coal mines to begin with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factory , and he 'd still be alive today . CRAVER PERRY That 's not how it happened . ( Beat ) Sir . BOXLER You can give his death any reason you want . Facts are not infallible . They are there to be interpreted in a way that 's useful to you . Why , your president does it , and he is no smarter than you . President Johnson says  --  p. 32 REMZI SABOURA President Bush . BOXLER Whatever the hell his name is , he said : " Our troops will not be asked to fight with one hand tied behind their back . " As you did in Vietnam . ( Begins to laugh ) Do you know how many tons of bombs were dropping on Vietnam ? Four million six hundred thousand . It 's awesome , is n't it ? REMZI SABOURA This is a different war , sir . BOXLER The tonnage dropped by the Allies in World War II was only three million . Now , my hands wo n't be tied behind my back when we go into Panama City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CRAVER PERRY It was called Operation Just Cause . Just Cause . REMZI SABOURA That was in ' 89 . In December . BOXLER I 'll be driving a tank there . They promised me I could drive a tank this time . The only nuisance is that crunching sound under my treads . A crunching sound , like this . ( Makes the sound ) Civilians have so little consideration . CRAVER PERRY You were never in Panama , sir . REMZI SABOURA There were no civilian deaths to speak of . BOXLER But not to speak of , I 'd say about three thousand . Now , when we went into the barrios of Grenada p. 33 REMZI SABOURA Just where have n't you been , sir ? CRAVER PERRY To hell . He has n't been to hell , but he 's on his way there . BOXLER Oh , there you 're wrong . I stood outside the gates for a very long time . In rain and snow , fire and brimstone , but they would n't let me in . I do n't know why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lue Ming 's voice offstage calling : ) LUE MING Fairouz ! Fairouz ! BOXLER Now we 're ready for lesson two . How to handle women in combat . ( Lue Ming calls : " Where are you ? " in Vietnamese . ) Hear it ? ( Remzi and Craver do not hear Lue Ming 's voice .

I had very long hair , beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . ( Beat ) But one day Rush did n't bring any gum and he took out his knife and cut off my braid . FAIROUZ SABOURA Was it a slow knife ? Serrated are slow . LUE MING Oh no , it was a quick knife , a Rush knife , and he strapped my hair to the back of his helmet . His friends laughed and laughed . Rush looked so very silly with his camouflage helmet on and this long , black braid hanging down his back . FAIROUZ SABOURA It was only hair . LUE MING I 'd be careful if I were blindfolded . FAIROUZ SABOURA I like it . I could go anywhere in the world right now , and to do it I would n't have to lift a finger . LUE MING Or a foot . FAIROUZ SABOURA I 'm four hundred and thirty miles from home . This is the first time I 've been outside of Atlanta . The first time I 've flown in a plane . p. 36 LUE MING I despise flying . It puts my hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message to Remzi ? LUE MING Your brother 's not accepting messages these days . FAIROUZ SABOURA I 'm sorry , but I do n't have time for your lost braid .

FAIROUZ SABOURA When we were small , the children from our school would come to our house to have a look at my funny foot . You made them pay a dime each time they had a look . REMZI SABOURA I split the profit with you , fifty-fifty . FAIROUZ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my idea . FAIROUZ SABOURA I used to lie awake at night , for years , dreaming of ways to kill you . I thought : if I kill him , there will be no one to hate . I was investing my hatred in you . It was a long-term investment . Really , I think you owe me some thanks . REMZI SABOURA For hating me ? FAIROUZ SABOURA Yes . Then you would n't be surprised by the hate of the world . p. 38 CRAVER PERRY ( Offstage ) : Remzi ! Remzi ! ( Craver , offstage and " somewhere else , " calls Remzi 's name , and Remzi exits . Lue Ming enters . ) FAIROUZ SABOURA Listen to me . You do n't have the right balance . I do . You see , I love you , but I hate you too . I have to . Tightly , tightly . As though at any moment either of us could slip off this earth . Are you listening to me ? LUE MING ( Answering as Remzi ) : Yes , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go say good-bye to Mother . She 's in her room , and she wo n't come out . She says they 'll kill you . Just like they killed Father . LUE MING ( As Remzi ) : That was an accident , and you know it . He fell onto the lily pads and into the pond and drowned . FAIROUZ SABOURA His face was messed up . As though he 'd been hit many times . LUE MING ( As Remzi ) : Water can do that to a face . FAIROUZ SABOURA I 've told Mother that , Remzi . Over and over I 've told her that it 's the Iraqis you 're going off to fight , but she keeps saying ( Speaks in Arabic and then translates ) " They 'll kill him . The Yankees will kill him . " Silly old woman . She 's all mixed up . p. 39 Act 1 , Scene 9 SCENE NINE A military camp in Saudi Arabia , in the past . Remzi is sitting alone and reciting . REMZI SABOURA Tabun .

She called me " Yankee Palestina . " These people lose their homes . They live in poverty , and they 're the enemies of the world . ( Throws Craver a bag of figs ) I brought that for you . CRAVER PERRY Nice you remembered I existed . I think of the three , I 'm the white fig variety . How do you say it ? REMZI SABOURA Abiyad . CRAVER PERRY Yeah . Abiyad . ( Tastes a fig ) These are nasty . REMZI SABOURA You 're not eating them right . You do n't just plug them in your mouth like a wad of chewing tobacco .

( Craver eats it . ) CRAVER PERRY Nastier than the first one . REMZI SABOURA No . Look . You 're gobbling . CRAVER PERRY Why did n't you buy me a souvenir , like a nice little prayer rug ? REMZI SABOURA Eating is like walking . My sister taught me that . There 's a balance involved . You have to eat the fig gently . As though it were made of the finest paper . ( Puts a fig in his own hand ) Look . I 'll put the fig in my hand , and , without touching my hand , you pick it up . Gently . ( Craver starts to use his fingers , Remzi stops his hand . ) With your mouth . ( Beat ) Go on . See if you can do it .

( Remzi helps the fig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How does it taste now ? CRAVER PERRY ( After some moments of silence ) : Did you take a lot of pictures ? REMZI SABOURA On the streets of Atlanta I 've been called every name you can think of : pimp , terrorist , half-nigger , mongrel , spic , wop , even Jew-bastard . And to these people in this camp it did n't matter a damn that I was some kind of a mix . Some kind of a something else , born someplace in a somewhere else than my face said .

CRAVER PERRY Things get lost . People  --  FAIROUZ SABOURA Get lost . But why not you ? Why did n't you get lost ? CRAVER PERRY Because I fell in love . In our bunkers at night , Remzi used to read the names out loud to us , and it calmed us down . He must have read that weapons manual a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body . Lullabies . It was like they were always the same and always there , and when we said them to ourselves there was nothing else like it : Fishbeds , Floggers and Fulcrums . Stingers , Frogs , Silkworms , Vulcans , Beehives and Bouncing Bettys . FAIROUZ SABOURA Did you love my brother ? CRAVER PERRY I ca n't remember . FAIROUZ SABOURA But you can . You will . Remember !

CRAVER PERRY It has an engine thrust of thirteen thousand seven hundred and fifty pounds and a maximum speed of five hundred and ninety-five miles per hour . It 's slow but it 's bad . FAIROUZ SABOURA If you could give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the B-52s , won the Gulf War . Not the smarts . Not the smarts . FAIROUZ SABOURA Or a number , what would it be ? CRAVER PERRY Ninety-three percent of the bombs dropped were free-falls from the bellies of Fat Fellows . FAIROUZ SABOURA If you could give his flesh a number ? CRAVER PERRY Only seven percent were guided , and , of these half-wits , forty percent missed their targets . FAIROUZ SABOURA A number that 's short of infinity ? Was that your desire for him ? CRAVER PERRY Forty forty-five percent of the smarts they missed FAIROUZ SABOURA Something short of infinity ? CRAVER PERRY They missed their targets . FAIROUZ SABOURA Did you or did you not fuck him ? p. 49 CRAVER PERRY That ( Beat ) is a lot of missed targets . FAIROUZ SABOURA OK : Mr. White Trash likes Arab ass , yes ? Is it good ? Is it sweet like white ass ? Do you find it exotic ? CRAVER PERRY I 'm not that kind of a soldier . FAIROUZ SABOURA He could be a bastard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt him in any way , I 'll tear your heart out . CRAVER PERRY Remzi never said he had a sister with a limp . His sister , he said she walked like a princess . FAIROUZ SABOURA Was he gentle with you ? Sometimes when we were children he would soak my foot in a bowl of warm water , with lemon and orange rinds . He would blow on my toes to dry them . He thought if he cared for my foot , day by day , and loved it , that somehow it would get better . ( Beat ) What was it like to kiss him ? CRAVER PERRY After the Buffs it was the GR . MK-1 Jaguar with two Rolls-Royce Adour MK-102 turbofans . A fuselage pylon and four wing pylons can carry up to ten thousand pounds of armaments ( Remzi now " appears .

REMZI SABOURA At any given moment ? CRAVER PERRY Any given moment . REMZI SABOURA How about now ? CRAVER PERRY We could go to jail . It 's illegal in the army . REMZI SABOURA So are white phosphorous howitzer shells . So are fuel-air explosives . CRAVER PERRY We do n't decide what gets dropped . REMZI SABOURA Would you kiss me if I were dead ? CRAVER PERRY Why would I kiss you if you were dead ? REMZI SABOURA Would you kiss me if I were alive ? CRAVER PERRY I had a thing for the Sentry jet , but how long can love last , after the first kiss , after the second , still around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went on to the Wild Weasel , F-4G . Like a loyal old firehorse , the Weasel was back in action . p. 51 REMZI SABOURA Have you ever touched the underbelly of a recon plane ? Two General Electric J79-15 turbojets . CRAVER PERRY If you run your hand along its flank , just over the hip , to the rear end , it will go wet . Not damp but I mean wet .

CRAVER PERRY Ever had a Phoenix missile at the tip of your tongue ? Nine hundred and eighty-five pounds of power , at launch . ( Craver moves to kiss Remzi , but at the last moment Remzi moves away . ) FAIROUZ SABOURA Is that how you kissed him ? CRAVER PERRY I kissed a girl for the first time when I was twelve . She had a mouth full of peanut butter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ever seen an airplane take off vertically ? That 's what I was when I kissed Remzi , like the AV-8B Harrier II , straight up into the air , no runway , no horizontal run , but VTO , vertical takeoff . FAIROUZ SABOURA Why do n't you say it ? CRAVER PERRY One Rolls-Royce turbojet going up , engine thrust twenty-one thousand five hundred pounds maximum speed . p. 52 FAIROUZ SABOURA Please . Just say it . CRAVER PERRY Forever . Remzi said to me the first time he kissed me : " What are you now , Craver Perry ? A White Trash River Boy who kisses Arabs and likes it ? " I said , " I 'm a White Trash , River Boy , Arab-kissing Faggot . " And the rest , as they say , is history . ( Beat ) Remzi was , as they say , history too . FAIROUZ SABOURA Remzi is dead , is n't he ? CRAVER PERRY I said he was history . That 's something else . FAIROUZ SABOURA How can this be funny to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sand , just what would you say to him ? Imagine it . There he is . Dead on the sand . A bullet in his neck . FAIROUZ SABOURA Bled to death ? CRAVER PERRY Maybe . What would you do ? ( Fairouz touches his face . ) Like that ? Would you touch Remzi like that ? What if he did n't have a face ? What if his face were gone too ? ( She kisses Craver on the cheek . ) That would take a lot of guts if he did n't have a face . FAIROUZ SABOURA What was it for ? You 're of no use to me . Just a dead brother now . Zero . No more Remzi to hate . No more Remzi p. 53 CRAVER PERRY to love . That 's right . Do you think we 're doing it too , falling in love ?

( Remzi enters , unobserved by either of them . ) My brother was the kind that watched . Is he the other kind now , Mr. Perry ? ( Beat ) I think I 'm going to scream . ( Craver now sees Remzi and backs away , watching the two of them , as though he is seeing them both in the past . Remzi holds her foot . ) REMZI SABOURA ( Talking to her gently ) : Just once more . FAIROUZ SABOURA I ca n't . I ca n't REMZI SABOURA You 've got to do it or you 'll never walk right . Just once more . FAIROUZ SABOURA Just once more . Only once more . Will it be better then ? REMZI SABOURA Soon . It will be better soon . ( Remzi twists her foot , and she lets out a sound of pain that is part scream and part the low , deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of place and time . She summons up the Gulf War : the deafening sound of jets , bombs , guns . The war sounds continue through the following invocation . LUE MING My sweet . My love . Come out from your hiding .

It was like the branch of a tree . That 's how heavy it was . I said to myself : Craver , you 're not carrying what you think you 're carrying . It 's just a piece of tree . For the fire . And you 're out in your backyard in Hazard , Kentucky , and he 's still alive , my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having a barbecue . And I can smell the coals .

( Beat ) This box you see before you is a very special box . It 's a common device we use here within the military , a receptacle in which soldiers can relieve themselves of contraband , no questions asked . Would you like to drop something in it ? You ca n't take those bits and pieces home with you . No , no , no . I 've already made the rounds with the other troops . You 're not alone . ( Lifts the lid just a bit but then slams it shut ) What distinguishes this particular box is its stench . Now some soldiers are more attached to their souvenirs than others ; in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military flight leaving the base for Chicago . One might assume that someone somewhere would be disciplined for anatomical trophy-hunting , but no , not this time . Lucky , lucky . Are you listening ? I 'm ready for hell , but they wo n't have me and that 's where they 're wrong . ( Beat ) All that nasty shit , it took place all the time , before I even killed my first one .

FAIROUZ SABOURA I do n't usually show men my foot unless I take my pants off first . ( Craver takes a look at her foot . ) It does n't smell very good , does it ? Remzi used to crush grass , and dandelions , sweet clover , sometimes even the wings of insects , all together in a bowl . He was quite a medic .

She takes a hammer from her skirt . ) Bitch . REMZI SABOURA Get away from her ! CRAVER PERRY Fucking Arab whore . REMZI SABOURA Get away from her . I 'm warning you ! FAIROUZ SABOURA Take a look , Craver . This is n't a B-52 . This is n't a Buff . This is a hammer . I could do to your face what they did to my foot . p. 75 CRAVER PERRY Go on then .

REMZI SABOURA No ! CRAVER PERRY ( Pushes the hammer away ) : No . ( Remzi goes " unconscious . " Fairouz and Craver are alone . ) A plague . A flood . An ice age . That 's what I expected when it was over and I got back here . An earthquake . Something that would rip this country wide open . Eighty-eight thousand tons of explosives dropped . That country is like a body with every bone inside it broken . FAIROUZ SABOURA How did he die ? CRAVER PERRY Every single bone . We tried . Day after day , but there were too many pieces . We could n't get them all . Do you know how many pieces make up the human body ? Two , three hundred thousand . ( Beat ) Dead . Maybe half of them civilians . We bombed the sewers , the electricity , the water . They 'll die in the thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 76 FAIROUZ SABOURA Give me an answer . CRAVER PERRY They came for us . Both of us . FAIROUZ SABOURA But you 're still alive . CRAVER PERRY The question here is n't how many feet were between Remzi and I. It could have been thirty feet . Or twenty-five . I think it was more like twenty . FAIROUZ SABOURA Tell me . CRAVER PERRY I had practiced it with him . I got it down just right . Do you want to see how I walked ? ( Craver does his " walk " for her as she watches him . ) Are you watching me ? ( Continues his " walk " ) p. 77 Act 2 , Scene 8 SCENE EIGHT Boxler and Lue Ming alone . BOXLER I remember you .

BOXLER It 's simple : a bit of a clump of a piece of ( Beat ) a piece of the future is alive , and then it is n't . LUE MING Were you ever in love ? BOXLER Oh , yes . Long ago . I was born a human being , you know . But one ca n't stay that way forever . One has to mature . ( Beat ) Maybe it was you I fell in love with . I mean , it could have happened , could n't it ? ( He kisses her . She does not respond. ) p. 78 LUE MING Why was n't one time enough ? BOXLER Because I wanted to kiss you again . Naturally . LUE MING Why did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just to make sure ? BOXLER Just to make sure , I did it four times . And shooting a child , if you must know , is rather exceptional . It 's like shooting an angel . There 's something religious about it . LUE MING I woke up after you and your troops were gone . I woke up with my child in my arms . A dead child weighs so much more than a live one . I carried her back to the village . When I was well again , I continued my work with the Vietcong . I was one of their top commanders . I searched for you everywhere . Everywhere . With more passion than one would a lost lover . But I never found you . BOXLER Just how did you die ? LUE MING I ca n't remember . How long have you been dead ? BOXLER Calley is still alive and well in Georgia , only I 've run out on him .

It 's the only place that feels like home . I did n't kill your daughter . Calley did . I was inside him , looking out , but I did n't do it . I did n't pull the trigger . LUE MING You watched . BOXLER What else can a soul do but watch ? We 're not magicians . LUE MING Are you suffering ? BOXLER I ca n't suffer . I ca n't , and it hurts me . LUE MING Is it terrible ? BOXLER It tears me apart . LUE MING How long will this go on ? BOXLER World without end . LUE MING Delightful . More than I 'd hoped . ( Beat ) But I want you to make a sound for me .

LUE MING You owe it to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know what you 're talking about . p. 80 FAIROUZ AND LUE MING The sound  --  FAIROUZ SABOURA you made inside you . Not the second time . LUE MING Not the third or fourth . But the first time you died . BOXLER The first time I died . LUE MING Yes . BOXLER That would be sometime in November 1967 . There was an old man . He was wounded . He would n't have made it anyway . I threw him down a well . REMZI SABOURA ( To Craver ) : I could n't say it any louder . I whispered her name . ( Whispers ) Fairouz . CRAVER PERRY ( Whispers ) : Fairouz . REMZI SABOURA There were five of them . FAIROUZ SABOURA Go on . BOXLER I threw him down a well . An old man .

He had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . BOXLER I was a child once . Did you know that ? I liked to run naked and jump up and down on the bed . I had a bath toy . A blue bath toy . I ca n't remember what it was . p. 81 REMZI SABOURA They got one of her shoes off . Then the sock . I stood behind the bushes and watched . CRAVER PERRY You looked out for yourself . That was right . REMZI SABOURA I was afraid that if I tried to stop them they 'd do the same to me . CRAVER PERRY Shhhhhhhhh . BOXLER I threw him down the well . I heard a crack . I heard a splash . I heard a crack and a splash , and I died . CRAVER PERRY You were just a kid . ( Craver and Remzi kiss , and Craver removes Remzi 's shirt . ) FAIROUZ SABOURA You were just a child . BOXLER When I killed him , I died , though I did n't make a sound when I died . My body just turned and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the job . LUE MING But I heard it . I heard the splash . And I heard you die . FAIROUZ SABOURA Do you want to know what it sounds like ? LUE MING What it sounds like to go on living and the child in your arms is so heavy and she is dead and you are dead and I am dead but  --  LUE MING AND FAIROUZ We just keep living . p. 82 BOXLER Forever and ever . LUE MING It sounded like this : ( Lue Ming , Fairouz and Boxler all scream : " No . " Their screams are deafening and mixed with the sound of thundering jets . Remzi and Craver look up at the awe-inspiring jets above them. ) p. 83 Act 2 , Scene 9 SCENE NINE Craver and Fairouz in his motel room . Craver is still holding Remzi 's shirt . CRAVER PERRY That 's beautiful . Sad Eyes . The CBUs were prohibited weapons , like the napalm , cluster and fragmentation . But Sad Eyes . Who would have had the heart to try and stop a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sad , really . But confused . Or furious . Or scared . ( Remzi appears as a vision . Craver speaks to him . ) The first time we made love , we were so scared and I started to cry . It was a first time for both of us , and it hurt . You leaned over me and kissed the back of my neck and you said over and over : REMZI SABOURA You are my white trash , and I love you . ( Craver mouths the words along with Remzi . ) CRAVER AND REMZI You are my white trash , and I love you . CRAVER PERRY They caught us together , out behind the barracks . They were lower ranks . Just kids . Like me . Kids who grew up with garbage in their backyards . Kids who never got the summer jobs , who did n't own CD players . They knocked us around . After a while , they took us to a room . Handed us over to an upper rank . There was a British officer and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and saying : " Sandnigger . Indian . Gook . " ( Beat ) Remzi . Well . He went wild . He jumped one of those officers . I was standing there . I could n't move . I could n't Then somebody hit me over the head , and I went out . ( Beat ) The first time I came to , the prisoner was down and he kept waving his arms like he was swimming , doing the backstroke , and Remzi was there and I could hear his voice , but it was like trying to see through a sheet of ice . ( Beat ) My head was spinning , and it was snowing stars . In that room . In the middle of the biggest bunch of hottest nowhere in the world and it was snowing stars and Remzi in the center of it and this one officer or maybe it was two and there was a knife and the Iraqi had stopped moving  --  I think he was dead  --  and they were all over him and having a good time at it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you want to know how you died , Remzi ? p. 84 REMZI SABOURA Friendly fire . CRAVER PERRY One of them had his arm around my neck , choking me , while another one held you down . I shouted for you to stay down but you would n't stay down . Each time he knocked you down you stood up . He hit you in the mouth so many times I could n't tell anymore what was your nose and what was your mouth . ( Beat ) What did you call the other soldiers when you first joined up ? REMZI SABOURA Family . CRAVER PERRY When I woke up , I took him in my arms . The blood had stopped coming out . ( Beat ) Five foot eleven inches . That 's how tall you were . I used to run my hand up and down your spine like I was reading the bones . REMZI SABOURA I wanted to travel everyplace on your body . Even the places you 'd never been . Love can make you feel so changed you think the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survived the war . ( To Craver ) What are you ? FAIROUZ SABOURA ( To Craver ) : What are you ?
