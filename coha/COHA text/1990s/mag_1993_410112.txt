First of all , it had the Matterhorn . That was probably the most important factor . Second of all , it was in Switzerland , which somehow , in our minds , is the prototypical Alps place : Heidi , cows with big bronze bells , yodelers , cheese , chocolate , and all that . Third of all , I wanted to impress my wife , Christina , with my ability to provide her with remarkable trips to fabled places , so it had to be somewhere really great , and I thought " what could be better than Zermatt , for God 's sake . " So we went . Because we had never skied in Europe before and because the thought of airports , transfers , trains , languages we did n't speak , and money that is n't green made us tense , we decided to book a package . That way , everything would be taken care of ( we hoped ) , and all we 'd have to do was show up with our skis , our loud , corn-fed American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spend as little money as possible . ( For more detailed info on our package , see the box on page 112 . ) We flew Swissair , in part because we were going to Europe and thought it would be cool to fly a Euro airline , and in part because Swissair offered the cheapest ticket to Zurich ( okay , so the cheap part was the main reason , and we just got lucky on the cool Euro part ) . We got all the little Euro touches , like flight attendants with accents , a channel on our headsets playing Swiss folk music , an American movie dubbed into German , Swissair slipper-socks , an almost ruthlessly efficient meal service , little chocolates after dinner , and , best of all  --  free liquor , even in coach . We landed early , with apologies from the captain . That was as good a prelude to Switzerland as any , where ruthless efficiency rules the day . We picked up our baggage , put it on one of the many free carts , and popped down a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train station . As simple as that . We felt the first gentle tug of the train moving just as the hands on my watch were lining up with the correct numbers . In fact , not once in our entire stay did a train leave or arrive at a station more than 30 seconds off the exact scheduled arrival or departure time . We checked our two ski bags and two big boot/clothes bags through to Zermatt at the train station , in part so we would n't have to lug the bags around as we changed trains , and in part to test the system . I recommend it . It cost the equivalent of $6.30 per bag , and they appeared at the door of our hotel room in Zermatt within an hour of our arrival . The train trip was beautiful , just like a train trip through Switzerland should be . We munched chocolate and watched the green hills turn to massive Alpine mountains so tall that we had to lean down to see the peaks out the train window . That is one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceeds your Swiss expectations . We had a similar experience in Zermatt itself . We 'd be walking through town , fully captivated by its charm and small scale . But then , every once in a while , we 'd come around a corner , and bang ! we 'd be smack up against a view of the Matterhorn that sucked us out of the dark , twisted streets and up into the bright , icy sky . Alright , you 're saying , enough about Switzerland 's damn Swissness . What about the skiing ? Well , let me say right up front that there is so much skiing at Zermatt of such high quality that it is impossible to begin to do it justice here . First of all , there 's the more-than-7,000-foot vertical drop from the top of the 12,000-foot Klein Matterhorn ( Little Matterhorn ) to the village of Zermatt , a run of close to nine miles , all of it downhill . All along that nine miles , there is other skiing on both sides . And that 's just one part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really a ski area in the American sense , but a bunch of lifts stretched over an entire glacier and mountain range . And most of it is above tree line , so you can ski pretty much wherever you like . So do n't expect it to be like American skiing . Just as the scenery reeks of Old Worldliness , so , too , does the skiing . On the downside , you will spend a lot of time waiting on lines with people who either do n't care that they are waiting on line because that is what one does at ski areas in Europe , or who will push their way in front of you with such brazenness that you will wonder for a moment whether it was you who quite rudely pushed your way in back of them . In addition , they will be smoking stinky little French cigarettes . Just accept it , laugh at it , break off a little piece of the chocolate bar in your pocket , and enjoy the scenery and the expensive Euro-style ski togs everyone but you is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovery that , for the most part , the folks who pushed in front of you are lousy skiers who rarely leave the piste  --  the groomed part of the hill  --  and therefore leave all the powder to camera-toting , loud-but-polite Americans . We discovered this on our first day of skiing . It was a gorgeous , sunny day , and we decided to head straight to the top , the highest you could go and the closest you could get to the Matterhorn . This meant taking three trams 7,000 vertical feet up to the Klein Matterhorn . The final tram is one of those incredible feats of Euro-tram engineering , crossing the Unterer Theodulgletscher , a huge glacier , and climbing almost vertically up the solid rock face of the Klein Matterhorn . It took us over an hour to get there from the village , but it 's one cool way to blow an hour of lift-ticket time . The tram deposits you on a concrete platform crammed , somewhat precariously it seems , into a teensy niche in the face of the Klein Matterhorn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 200-meter-long tunnel carved out of solid rock . Since the trams come up one at a time , six an hour , and only hold 100 people , the top can only get so crowded . Wait two minutes for everyone else to head down , nibble some more of that intensely rich chocolate , and you 've got the place to yourself , at least for another eight minutes . From the tunnel , the piste swoops away in a big arc , and beyond the arc is a roped-off area , an entire bowl , where absolutely no one is going . And since this is Europe , ropes just mean no patrol , not no skiing . It looked pretty nice , so I hopped in , with Christina threatening to kick my butt if I got caught in an avalanche . I did n't , and I started kicking turns in the wind-packed but eminently skiable powder . Turn after turn after turn , it seemed to never end . I looked up , and there was the Matterhorn . I looked down and there were still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the piste ; I could still smell and taste the chocolate on my tongue , and I started to laugh , and soon I was laughing uncontrollably , and my legs were aching because I was still turning , turning , turning , and then I fell in a big snowy , laughing heap . Then I knew why skiers who have been to Europe are constantly raving about skiing in Europe . Skiing in Europe is exactly like skiing in Europe is supposed to be . The lack of crowds in all the best places just seems to be the way things are at Zermatt , even on a powder morning . One night we got some new snow , and the next morning I and a collection of Americans and Norwegians I 'd met ended up over by the Hornli T-bar , an area that I had heard was good for powder . Sure enough , the snow seemed to be twice as deep there as anywhere else we 'd been  --  at least a foot and a half deep . We were just having a ball , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only other people out there were some Japanese skiers who looked as if they 'd never seen this much snow in their lives . Meanwhile , looming right above us was the north face of the Matterhorn , and spread out in front of us , appearing intermittently through the clouds , were the Alps . The Zermatt trail map is abysmal , not the result , I think , of a lack of caring on the part of its makers , but of an acknowledgement that the ski terrain is just too vast and the topography too complicated to accurately chart on a piece of paper the size of a trail map . So instead there 's a painting of a mountain range with a bunch of vague thin lines running down it , indicating the approximate location of the marked runs . And since you can ski so much more than the marked trails anyway , this hardly paints an accurate picture of the scope of skiing available . A worthwhile souvenir is a topo map of the area , which gives you a much clearer notion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be divided grossly into three areas . To the south , there is the Klein Matterhorn area , accessible from town via by a series of trams and nearest the Matterhorn ; to the southeast , the Gornergrat area , accessible from town via a cog railway and with the best views of the Matterhorn ; and to the east , there 's the Sunnega/Rothorn area , accessible via the Sunnegabahn , an underground cog railway much like a modern subway . You can get directly from Sunnega/Rothorn to Gornergrat with some effort and vice versa , but you ca n't get from either to the Klein Matterhorn area without a great deal of effort . We 're talking huge distances here , though , and it would take several days in each one of these zones to get the lay of the land . And it is not all daunting , expert skiing . The vast majority of marked runs are intermediate , designed to be negotiated after a huge lunch and several glasses of fragrant wine or cool , hoppy beer . If you 're an expert or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a guide , who will keep you from getting lost and will show you the best snow . I wish now that we had hired a guide , but we had fun anyway . The off-piste opportunities are virtually limitless , but do n't attempt much without a guide . Most of the skiing is way above tree line , and it 's easy to become disoriented in the vast ocean of whiteness . It 's easy to forget , in a setting so cute , so benign , so like a postcard , that the Alps are a wilderness , a harsh environment just as unforgiving of error as any in the world . It is also absolutely crucial that you understand that you are not skiing in America , and that priorities are different . People are not concerned with getting in as many runs as they can , with zooming up and down and up and down . They are concerned with getting up late , heading out to the mountain for a few runs ( if it 's sunny ) , then choosing a place for lunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  maybe some plump , juicy wurst , or some perfectly cooked pasta with a cheesy , tomato-y sauce , all washed down with beer or wine  --  out on a deck , in the sun , and then wending their way back to town . To aid in this , there are something like 35 restaurants on the mountain , which are indicated on the trail map not with a knife and fork , but with a wine glass . They are scattered about unpretentiously , not necessarily at the top of a lift , nor at the bottom , but seemingly wherever someone decided it would be a scenic or pleasant place to put a restaurant . What I finally realized was that this is what all those overblown restaurants littering mountains in America are trying desperately to imitate , only they get it wrong . These are not fancy places , major events ; they are stube  --  cozy , rustic , well worn , and , given the ones we sampled , uniformly outstanding . I have spent my life in mad pursuit of as many runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I found myself adjusting pretty quickly to the wine , cheese , and chocolate approach to skiing . The same focus on creature comforts carried over to the lodging facilities . Our hotel , the Butterfly , which came as part of our package , was rated in the brochure as " standard , " which meant it was a notch below " first , " and two notches below " deluxe . " I make this distinction because we found ourselves wondering all week if this was standard , then what more could you get with deluxe ? In short , the place was delightful . As with most packages , ours included what is referred to as half-board , which means breakfast and dinner ( why they do n't call it two-thirds-board is beyond me ) . Breakfast consisted of a bread , animal , and animal-byproduct buffet . Stupendously fresh bread and various cheeses , cold cuts , yogurt , butter , and jam , all in prodigious quantities , made for enforced carbo-loading , and the jet-fuel-quality coffee slapped us into wakefulness each morning . Each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Amadeo , would greet us with " Good evening , Mr. Layermonn , " and a mischievous smile that said , " Look , I know you are only Americans , but here in Switzerland we are so gracious that it does n't really matter . " Dinner at the Butterfly was a five-course meal with soup , salad , appetizer , main course ( often including seconds ) , and dessert included . Liquor was extra . But the food was remarkable . This was not hotel food as Americans have come to expect it . One warning : Vegetarians will have to make special arrangements , as dinner was invariably some variation on veal , beef , or pork . There was one chicken night , but we missed it . There are no cars allowed in Zermatt . There are some little electric taxis and trucks , and some horse-drawn carriages and carts , but no cars or trucks burning gasoline . As a result , the town is peaceful and sane , the streets crowded with people window-shopping , strolling , eating , and going skiing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( By the way , we defy you to leave Switzerland without somehow finding yourself very seriously considering the purchase of some kind of utterly impractical timepiece , such as a cuckoo clock featuring a little two-inch-tall Swiss girl on a swing , with braids and a dirndl , bouncing rhythmically below the clock as it ticks . ) The only sounds in town are ski boots on cobblestones , skiers buying chocolate and renting ski equipment in a zillion languages , the wind , and , when you 're close to it , the river . Though Zermatt is very developed , and some of the development is ugly , most of it is not . Hotels have been built to look like charming Swiss hotels , and many old houses and little mini-barns still stand . The village as a whole is squeezed between steep mountainsides less than a third of a mile apart . The streets are all narrow and crooked , as though the village was too large to be crammed into its narrow valley home . In part because of the cramming and narrowness , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the lifts in town . At nine in the morning , it will just be you and some intrepid Brits . Besides , given that lunch is going to last two hours , you 'd better get an early start so you can get tons of skiing in . Or , if you 'll be skipping lunch , or packing your own ( a good idea , as prices on the mountain are astronomical , even by American ski area standards , and the grocery store in town is no more expensive than you 'd expect ) , you 'll want to get an early start so you can earn what I now consider a crucial component of skiing : an end of the day stube stop . For what better way is there to end the day than , part way down the mountain , stopping at a stube for beer or wine and a plate of tangy , salty , creamy , stinky cheeses , sitting outside with your feet up , eating and drinking as the sun sets , the air slightly sweet with the smell of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giggly , beery buzz , skiing the rest of the way into town in the deepening twilight . OUR PACKAGE We got our package from Swisspak ( the tour division of Swissair ) . We figured that if Swisspak does n't know its way around Switzerland , no one does , and it all went off without a hitch . The package cost $832 per person and included hotel , breakfast , dinner for seven nights , and train transportation . Our airfare cost $518 each , round trip from New York to Zurich , so the total cost was $1,350 per person . Some packages include airfare . One such package , from another tour operator to the same hotel , cost $1,459 , so we made out better on our own . But another American couple at our hotel had paid $800 for their tickets and $832 for their package , so they 'd have been better off at $1,459 . The variables , then , are airfare , the hotel , and when you go . For the week we went to Zermatt , the cheapest rates were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , or $1,181 ( airfare , hotel , breakfast , dinner , rail ) . Not cheap , certainly , but hey , it 's Zermatt . None of these packages included lift tickets , as most American packages do . A one-week pass cost 280 Swiss francs , which came to $196 . I also brought $500 in traveler 's checks and used every single solitary last one of them . To compare this to domestic prices , our per-person cost including lift passes was $1,546 ( remember that includes dinner and breakfast ) . For $1,550 you can get airfare , a six-day lift ticket , and seven nights at a hotel in Aspen described to me as being " like a Holiday Inn . " No breakfast , no dinner . <p>
