Latitudes and Departures I Snow-Balls have flown their Arcs , starr 'd the Sides of Outbuildings , as of Cousins , carried Hats away into the brisk Wind off Delaware ,  - -  the Sleds are brought in and their Runners carefully dried and greased , shoes deposited in the back Hall , a stocking'd-foot Descent made upon the great Kitchen , in a purposeful Dither since Morning , punctuated by the ringing Lids of various Boilers and Stewing-Pots , fragrant with Pie-Spices , peel 'd Fruits , Suet , heated Sugar ,  - -  the Children , having all upon the Fly , among rhythmic slaps of Batter and Spoon , coax 'd and stolen what they might , proceed , as upon each afternoon all this snowy Advent , to a comfortable Room at the rear of the House , years since given over to their carefree Assaults . Here have come to rest a long scarr 'd sawbuck table , with two mismatch 'd side-benches , from the Lancaster County branch of the family , some Second-Street Chippendale , including an interpretation of the fam 'd Chinese Sofa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be drawn all ' round to make a snug , dim tent ,  - -  a few odd Chairs sent from England before the War ,  - -  mostly Pine and Cherry about , nor much Mahogany , excepting a sinister and wonderful Card Table which exhibits the cheaper Wave-like Grain known in the Trade as Wand'ring Heart , causing an illusion of Depth into which for years children have gaz 'd as into the illustrated Pages of Books ... along with so many hinges , sliding Mortises , hidden catches , and secret compartments that neither the Twins nor their Sister can say they have been to the end of it . Upon the Wall , banish 'd to this Den of Parlor Apes for its Remembrance of a Time better forgotten , reflecting most of the Room ,  - -  the Carpet and Drapes a little fray 'd , Whiskers the Cat stalking beneath the furniture , looking out with eyes finely reflexive to anything suggesting Food ,  - -  hangs a Mirror in an inscrib 'd Frame , commemorating the " Mischianza , " that memorable farewell Ball stag 'd in ' 77 by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their Withdrawal from Philadelphia . This Christmastide of 1786 , with the War settl 'd and the Nation bickering itself into Fragments , wounds bodily and ghostly , great and small , go aching on , not ev'ry one commemorated ,  - -  nor , too often , even recounted . Snow lies upon all Philadelphia , from River to River , whose further shores have so vanish 'd behind curtains of ice-fog that the City today might be an Isle upon an Ocean . Ponds and Creeks are frozen over , and the Trees a-glare to the last slightest Twig ,  - -  Nerve- Lines of concentrated Light . Hammers and Saws have fallen still , bricks lie in snowcover 'd Heaps , City-Sparrows , in speckl 'd Outbursts , hop in and out of what Shelter there may be ,  - -  the nightward Sky , Clouds blown to Chalksmears , stretches above the Northern Liberties , Spring Garden and Germantown , its early moon pale as the Snow-Drifts ,  - -  smoke ascends from Chimney-Pots , Sledging-Parties adjourn indoors , Taverns bustle ,  - -  freshly infus 'd Coffee flows ev'ryplace , borne about thro ' Rooms front and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Association in these Parts , is deploy 'd nowadays like an ancient Elixir upon the seething Pot of Politics , for the Times are as impossible to calculate , this Advent , as the Distance to a Star . It has become an afternoon habit for the Twins and their Sister , and what Friends old and young may find their way here , to gather for another Tale from their far-travel 'd Uncle , the Rev.sup.d Wicks Cherrycoke , who arriv 'd here back in October for the funeral of a Friend of years ago ,  - -  too late for the Burial , as it prov 'd ,  - -  and has linger 'd as a Guest in the Home of his sister Elizabeth , the Wife , for many years , of Mr. J. Wade LeSpark. a respected Merchant active in Town Affairs , whilst in his home vet Sultan enough to convey to the Rev.sup.d , tho ' without ever so stipulating , that , for as long as he can keep the children amus 'd , he may remain ,  - -  too much evidence of Juvenile Rampage at the wrong moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Door with him , where waits the Winter 's Block and Blade . Thus , they have heard the Escape from Hottentot-Land , the Accursed Ruby of Mogok , the Ship-wrecks in Indies East and West , an Herodotic Web of Adventures and Curiosities selected , the Rev.sup.d implies , for their moral usefulness , whilst avoiding others not as suitable in the Hearing of Youth . The Youth , as usual , not being consulted in this . Tenebrae has seated herself and taken up her Needlework , a piece whose size and difficulty are already subjects of Discussion in the House , the Embroidress herself keeping silence , upon this Topick , at least . Announc 'd by Nasal Telegraph , in come the Twins , bearing the old Pewter Coffee-Machine venting its Puffs of Vapor , and a large Basket dedicated to Saccharomanic Appetites , piled to the Brim with fresh-fried Dough-Nuts roll 'd in Sugar , glaz 'd Chestnuts , Buns , Fritters , Crullers , Tarts . " What is this ? Why , Lads , you read my mind . " " The Coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Time , you were talking in your sleep , " the Pair explain , placing the Sweets nearer themselves , all in this Room being left to seize and pour as they may . As none could agree which had been born first , the Twins were nam 'd Pitt and Pliny , so that each might be term 'd " the Elder " or " the Younger , " as might day-today please one , or annoy his Brother . " Why have n't we heard a Tale about America ? " Pitt licking Gobbets of Philadelphia Pudding from his best Jabot . " With Indians in it , and Frenchmen , " adds Pliny , whose least gesture sends Cookie-crumbs ev'rywhere . " French Women , come to that , " mutters Pitt . " It 's not easy being pious for both of us , you know , " Pliny advises . " It 's twenty years , " recalls the Rev.sup.d , " since we all topped the Allegheny Ridge together , and stood looking out at the Ohio Country ,  - -  so fair , a Revelation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the McCleans , Darby and Cope , no , Darby wouldn't 've been there in ' sixty-six ,  - -  howbeit , old Mr. Barnes and young Tom Hynes , the rascal ... do n't know where they all went , some fought in the war , some chose peace come what might , some profited , some lost everything . Some are gone to Kentucky , and some , as now poor Mason ,  - -  to Dust . " ' T was not too many years before the War ,  - -  what we were doing out in that Country together was brave , scientifick beyond my understanding , and ultimately meaningless ,  - -  we were putting a line straight through the heart of the Wilderness , eight yards wide and due west , in order to separate two Proprietorships , granted when the World was yet feudal and but eight years later to be nullified by the War for Independence . " And now Mason 's gone , and the Rev.sup.d Cherrycoke , who came to town only to pay his Respects , has linger 'd , thro ' the first descent of cold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meals appearing upon the next-best Dishes . He had intended to be gone weeks ago , but finds he can not detach . Each day among his Devoirs is a visit , however brief , to Mason 's grave . The Verger has taken to nodding at him . In the middle of the night recently he awoke convinc 'd that ' t was he who had been haunting Mason ,  - -  that like a shade with a grievance , he expected Mason , but newly arriv 'd at Death , to help him with something . " After years wasted , " the Rev.sup.d commences , " at perfecting a parsonical Disguise ,  - -  grown old in the service of an Impersonation that never took more than a Handful of actor 's tricks ,  - -  past remembering those Yearnings for Danger , past all that ought to have been , but never had a Hope of becoming , have I beach 'd upon these Republican Shores ,  - -  stoven , dismasted , imbecile with age , an untrustworthy Remembrancer for whom the few events yet rattling within a broken memory must provide the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Tenebrae pretends to gasp , "  - -  and but this Morning , you look 'd so much younger ,  - -  why I 'd no idea . " " Kindly Brae . That is from my Secret Relation , of course . Do n't know that I 'd phrase it quite like that in the present Company . " " Then ... ? " Tenebrae replying to her Uncle 's Twinkling with the usual play of Eye-lashes . " It begins with a Hanging . " " Excellent ! " cry the Twins . The Rev.sup.d , producing a scarr 'd old Note-book , cover 'd in cheap Leather , begins to read . " Had I been the first churchman of modern times to be swung from Tyburn Tree , had I been then taken for dead , whilst in fact but spending an Intermission among the eventless corridors of Syncope , due to the final Bowl of Ale , had a riotous throng of medical students taken what they deem 'd to be my Cadaver back beneath the somber groins of their College , had I then been ' resurrected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being , in which Our Savior ,  - -  strange to say in that era of Wesley and Whitefield ,  - -  though present , would not have figur 'd as pre-eminently as with most Sectarians ,  - -  howbeit ,  - -  I should closely resemble the nomadic Parson you behold today ... " " Mother says you 're the Family outcast , " Pitt remarks . " They pay you money to keep away , " says Pliny . " Your Grandsire Cherrycoke , Lads , has ever kept his promise to remit to me , by way of certain Charter 'd Companies , a sum precise to the farthing and punctual as the Moon , to any address in the World , save one in Britain . Britain is his World , and he will persist , even now , in standing sham 'd before it for certain Crimes of my distant Youth . " " Crimes ! " exclaim the Boys together . " Why , so did wicked men declare ' em ... before God , another Tale .... " " What 'd they nail you on ? " Uncle Ives wishes to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Green Brief-bag over one shoulder , but lately return 'd from a Coffee-House Meeting , he is bound later this evening for a slightly more formal version of the same thing ,  - -  feeling , here with the children , much as might a Coaching Passenger let off at Nightfall among an unknown Populace , to wait for a connecting Coach , alone , pedestrian , desiring to pass the time to some Revenue , if not Profit . " Along with some lesser Counts , " the Rev.sup.d is replying , " ' t was one of the least tolerable of Offenses in that era , the worst of Dick Turpin seeming but the Carelessness of Youth beside it ,  - -  the Crime they styl 'd Anonymity . ' That is , I left messages posted publicly , but did not sign them . I knew some night-running lads in the district who let me use their Printing-Press ,  - -  somehow , what I got into printing up , were Accounts of certain Crimes I had observ 'd , committed by the Stronger against the Weaker ,  - -  enclosures , evictions , Assize verdicts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as many of the Perpetrators as I was sure of , yet keeping back what I foolishly imagin 'd my own . till the Night I was tipp 'd and brought in to London , in Chains , and clapp 'd in the Tower . " The Tower ! " " Oh , do not tease them so , " Tenebrae prays him . " Ludgate , then ? whichever , ' t was Gaol . It took me till I was lying among the Rats and Vermin , upon the freezing edge of a Future invisible , to understand that my name had never been my own ,  - -  rather belonging , all this time , to the Authorities , who forbade me to change it , or withhold it , as ' t were a Ring upon the Collar of a Beast , ever waiting for the Lead to be fasten 'd on .... One of those moments Hindoos and Chinamen are ever said to be having , entire loss of Self , perfect union with All , sort of thing . Strange Lights , Fires , Voices indecipherable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tale where your old Uncle gets to go insane , or so , then , each in his Interest , did it please ev'ryone to style me . Sea voyages in those days being the standard Treatment for Insanity , my Exile should commence for the best of Medical reasons . " Tho ' my Inclination had been to go out aboard an East Indiaman ( the Rev.sup.d continues ) , as that route East travers 'd notoriously a lively and youthful World of shipboard Dalliance , Gale-force Assemblies , and Duels ashore , with the French Fleet a constant , for some , Romantic ,  - -  danger , " Like Pirates , yet more polite , " as the Ladies often assur 'd me , alas , those who controll 'd my Fate , getting wind of my preference at the last moment , swiftly arrang 'd to have me transferr 'd into a small British Frigate sailing alone , upon a long voyage , in a time of War ,  - -  the Seahorse , twenty-four guns , Captain Smith . I hasten 'd in to Leadenhall Street to inquire . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greeted . " Are you saying that a sixth-rate is beneath you ? Would you prefer to remain ashore , and take up quarters in Bedlam ? It has made a man of many in your Situation . Some have come to enjoy fairly meaningful lives there . Or if it 's some need for the Exotic , we might arrange for a stay in one of the French Hospitals .... " " Would one of my Condition even know how to object , my Lord ? I owe you everything . " " Madness has not impair 'd your memory . Good . Keep away from harmful Substances , in particular Coffee . Tobacco and Indian Hemp . If you must use the latter , do not inhale . Keep your memory working , young man ! Have a safe Voyage . " So , with this no doubt well-meant advice finding its way into the mid-watch sounds of waves past my sleeping-place , I set sail upon an Engine of Destruction , in the hope that Eastward yet might dwell something of Peace and Godhead , which British Civilization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus was consternation the least of my feelings when , instead of supernatural Guidance from Lamas old as time , here came Jean Crapaud a-looming ,  - -  thirty- four guns ' worth of Disaster , and only one Lesson .
