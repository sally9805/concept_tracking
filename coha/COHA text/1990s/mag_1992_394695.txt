The names of most astronomers are quickly forgotten , as are their fleeting discoveries . Only a few make lasting contributions to astronomy . Among these stand giants like Johannes Kepler , William Herschel , and Edwin Hubble . Some of the giants , such as George Ellery Hale , have left a legacy of large optical telescopes and observatories . One astronomer , Grote Reber , is largely forgotten today , but he made a lasting contribution by designing the modern radio telescope . Reber designed and built the first parabolic-dish radio telescope . Most modern radio telescopes use one or more of these dishes to detect radio emission from celestial objects . But the idea to use a dish-type radio antenna to study stars and our Galaxy 's radio sources was n't new to Reber . Karl Jansky ( 1905-1950 ) , the engineer who opened the radio window to the universe , first suggested it . After obtaining his college degree in physics and completing a year of post-graduate study , Jansky joined the Bell Telephone Labs near Cliffwood , New Jersey , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of finding the cause of the static that interfered with shortwave transatlantic radiotelephone service . Customers paid $75 far a three-minute call and they did not like the hissing noise . Late in 1929 , Jansky started to build a rotating antenna in fields that once grew corn and potatoes . The 96-foot-long antenna was 13 feet high and used almost 400 feet of brass pipe mounted on a wooden frame . The antenna , which was hoisted on four Model T Ford wheels , turned three times per hour around a 33-foot-diameter circle , causing Jansky 's co-workers to call it " Jan 's merry-go-round . " Rotating the antenna enabled Jansky to determine the direction to the radio source that was causing the radiotelephone interference . This large antenna operated at a wavelength of 14.6 meters . In 1930 , the lab and Jansky 's antenna moved to Holmdel , New Jersey . Later in that year , Jansky observed only a little static , so he decided to investigate other aspects of radio communications . Resuming his search for the source of static in August 1931 , Jansky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By 1932 , he had identified three components to the radio noise : local thunderstorms , distant thunderstorms , and a hiss . By comparing records of succeeding days , he found that the source of the hiss did not recur in exactly 24 hours but in 23 hours and 56 minutes . In a year 's time , the pattern had slipped one whole day . Not being an astronomer , Jansky took some time to realize that he was dealing with a source fixed in space . He ruled out the Sun as the source of the noise , because the signal recurred four minutes earlier each day . ( Jansky could have detected radio bursts from the Sun , but it was in a quiet state near sunspot minimum in the early 1930s . ) Further observations revealed to Jansky that the signals picked up by his antenna came from the direction of the constellation Sagittarius , the center of the Milky Way Galaxy . Jansky reported his findings in the December 1932 and October 1933 issues of the Proceedings of the Institute of Radio Engineers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ titled " Electrical Disturbances of Extraterrestrial Origin " to a small audience in Washington , D.C. His paper attracted little attention from the scientific community , much to Jansky 's disappointment . But it did get him some national media exposure . A New York Times story reported Jansky 's discovery in the May 14 , 1933 , Sunday edition . On May 15 , the NBC Blue Network radio broadcast carried Jansky 's hiss by way of a direct hookup to the radio telescope . Jansky once again tried to interest the scientific community in his discovery of an astronomical radio source in a paper presented in Detroit on July 3 , 1935 . This paper described his detection of radio noise all along the plane of the Galaxy . But there were only two dozen people in his audience . Several reasons explain the lack of response on the part of astronomers to Jansky 's momentous discovery . Astronomers were not yet ready to venture into the radio portion of the spectrum , having just started photographic studies of stars and galaxies with large telescopes after years of visual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the astronomers ' repertoire , so they did n't know how to judge Jansky 's results properly . It was n't clear that radio emission studies would greatly aid studies of the Galaxy . And the country was deep in the Great Depression , so university astronomy departments could n't afford to hire radio engineers to pursue this discovery . Jansky proposed building a dish-type radio telescope to further pursue his cosmic radio source . But the beginning of radio astronomy came to a brief end when Jansky 's supervisor asked him to investigate another aspect of radiotelephone static . Only a few astronomers and radio engineers followed up on Jansky 's work . The most successful was Grote Reber . THE FIRST RADIO DISH Grote Reber  --  born December 22 , 1911 , in Wheaton , Illinois  --  started in radio communication as an enthusiastic radio " ham . " But after contacting other radio amateurs in over 60 countries , he was ready for a new challenge . While a student at what is now the Illinois Institute of Technology , Reber thought about using his radio transmitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calculations showed that the signals would be too weak to receive . After graduation he went to work at the Stewart-Warner Company , designing radio receivers . Reading Jansky 's articles inspired Reber to try as a home experiment to listen to the signals emitted by our Galaxy . Such a project was beyond the range of normal amateur radios . He needed special equipment . To capture the longer radio waves emitted by celestial bodies , Reber laid plans to make a parabolic reflector or dish antenna . The reflector would collect radio waves just as the mirror in an optical reflecting telescope collects light waves . Reber 's reflector then would focus the radio waves on a small antenna , which in turn would feed a radio receiver . After drawing up plans for a dish antenna , the young engineer asked for a bid from the American Bridge Company . Their price of $7,000 seemed excessive to a young man just starting a career in the midst of the Great Depression , so Reber decided to build the dish himself . With the assistance of two men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West Seminary Street in Wheaton . The mirror had a diameter of 31 feet and a focal length of 20 feet . The reflector was made of 45 pieces of galvanized sheet metal screwed to 72 radial wooden rafters cut to a parabolic shape . The telescope moved only in a north-south direction , a configuration astronomers call a transit instrument . Reber 's neighbors had plenty to talk about as his radio telescope took shape . When it rained , the reflector collected a large volume of water , which then poured through the center hole . This caused some to speculate that the machine had something to do with controlling the weather . And after an airplane developed engine trouble over the antenna , others thought that it was a military project , designed to disable aircraft . In September 1937 after four months of hard work , Reber and his helpers completed the radio telescope at a cost of $1,300 . Considering that a new automobile could be purchased for less than $1,000 in those days , this was no small investment on Reber 's part . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about to work out the problems involved in recording signals received from space . Because of interference from auto ignitions , he did most of his work from midnight until dawn . He worked all day at his job with Stewart-Warner , went to bed early , and slept until midnight , when his observations began . Reber obtained vacuum tubes from the University of Chicago and other radio components from his employer as he refined his receivers . He manually recorded the strength of the radio signals off a meter on the receiver . His early attempts were fruitless . Reasoning that radio sources should behave like other radiation sources and appear brighter at shorter wavelengths , Reber tried operating his radio telescope at shorter wavelengths than Jansky 's 14.6 meters . Starting at a wavelength of 9 centimeters ( microwaves ) he found nothing . By the summer of 1938 , he changed to a wavelength of 33 cm but still had no luck . Finally , at 1.87 m ( VHF-high shortwave radio ) , his efforts paid off in the spring of 1939 . Once Reber 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set about to make a radio map of the Milky Way Galaxy . His map of the radio intensity of celestial objects was akin to the optical maps of the Galaxy first made by William Herschel in the 18th century . Reber looked through the radio window to make his map of the Milky Way Galaxy . One of his first observations was that cosmic static was strongest when he focused on the constellation Sagittarius . This confirmed Jansky 's report . Other hot spots were centered in Cygnus , Cassiopeia , Canis Major , and Puppis . Working alone in the field of radio astronomy , Reber recognized his duty to publish his findings . This he began to do in 1940 . At first , astronomers did n't know how to judge Reber 's results , because they never had seen anything like them . Later , they were too busy with defense-related research to pay much attention to the new science . ( The paper did make it to Nazi-occupied Holland , however . After reading Reber 's article , Jan Oort , the originator of the comet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the possibility of radio lines  --  single wavelengths of emission by a source . Van de Hulst discovered that hydrogen should emit strongly at 21 cm , radiation first observed in 1951 . ) For nearly a decade Reber 's telescope was the only one in the world , and he was the only radio astronomer . In 1943 Reber turned his radio telescope toward the Sun . He had not done so previously because of his work schedule . Solar radio waves caused his recording instrument to be driven full-scale . Later he learned from articles published after the war that British scientists had accidentally run across solar radio waves in 1942 as they worked on military radar . They thought that the Germans were jamming their equipment when in fact the Sun was the culprit . Before Reber 's Wheaton operations ended in 1947 , he worked on improved maps of the Galaxy , detecting emission from such sources as the Crab Nebula in Taurus and the Rosette Nebula in Monoceros . In 1948 Reber accepted a position as chief of the University of Virginia 's experimental microwave radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While rebuilding the antenna , he installed the turntable he had built in 1941 , while considering a move to Texas . This allowed him to move the telescope around in azimuth in addition to the prior up and down motion in altitude , enabling him to look at radio sources anywhere in the sky . By 1954 Reber joined the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization in Tasmania , off the coast of southern Australia , where he has lived ever since . He left his original radio telescope behind . Eventually it found a permanent resting place in Green Bank , West Virginia , where it stands today near the entrance to the grounds of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory ( NRAO ) . Astronomers today still use the telescope occasionally . By the 1950s , many other scientists and engineers had joined Reber in radio wave research . Britain , Holland , and Australia led the way and many other nations followed in the construction of giant radio dish antennas . This surge of interest occurred as the many physicists and radio engineers , who were trained during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new fields of research . Reber continues his research and even spent several winters in Canada during the 1980s to look for very-long-wavelength radio emissions . But his greatest contributions to astronomy were the introduction of the parabolic reflector radio telescope and the demonstration that the radio window was important to the progress of astronomy . Most modern radio telescopes owe their basic design to the dish Reber built in 1937 . The largest single dish radio telescope is 1,000 feet in diameter and is located at Arecibo , Puerto Rico . Many modern radio telescopes use a combination of small radio dishes to collect radio waves . The antennas are spaced apart and the signals from each are added together . Such a telescope is called a radio interferometer , but it uses the basic radio dish invented by Reber . The largest single grouping of radio telescopes is the Very Large Array ( VLA ) built outside Socorro , New Mexico . And radio astron-omers can now add signals from radio telescopes on opposite sides of Earth to form an even larger radio telescope with a technique called very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 antennas spread from New Hampshire to the Virgin Islands and Hawaii is one such telescope . But whether it 's one large dish like Arecibo , or the collection of 17 dishes at the VLA , they all owe their existence to the inventiveness of Grote Reber , who launched a life of contributions by building the first dish-type radio telescope .

THE NATIONAL SCHOOL LIBRARY MEDIA PROGRAM OF THE YEAR AWARD ( NSLMPY ) IS PRESENTED BY THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL LIBRARIANS ( AASL ) , AND GOES TO A SCHOOL LIBRARY MEDIA PROGRAM THAT IS FULLY INTEGRATED INTO THEIR SCHOOL 'S CURRICULUM AND IS FULFILLING THEIR COMMITMENT TO ENSURING STUDENTS AND STAFFS ARE EFFECTIVE USERS OF IDEAS AND INFORMATION . <p> Furthermore , a best program has to be an example of Information Power : Building Partnerships for Learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , student-centered school library media programs ) , in action . 0f course those standards have been updated with the 2008 AASL Standards for the 21st-Century Learner , but the core principles remain the same . <p> This is certainly a tall order , but since the Award 's 1963 inception , there has been some 74 programs honored . Each winning program in the three areas , receives a $10,000 prize ( $30,000 total ) , which is donated by Follett Library Resources , a company that provides educational materials to school libraries . <p> Teacher Librarian asked NSLMPY recipients from 2005 to 2008 to discuss their programs and environments . From their responses we hope you gather some great ideas to implement in your programs and practices . <p> L : SCHOOL LIBRARY INTERACTION Regardless of size or developmental level , all NSLMPY winners spoke about the need for school libraries to be a gathering place or center for the entire learning community . Their partnerships were many and included not only partnerships with public libraries , but partnerships with businesses and community centers in the area . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GA , found a way to bring the community 's equestrian interest into the library , offering resources about horses to students as well as a chance to tactilely interact with horses around them . <p> Simsbury High School , CT , organized a drive to connect students with the public library database systems , modeling the ability to connect students with information across the nation . <p> Norman Public Schools , OK ( a district winner ) , went about defining how best practices known to teacher-librarians could be implemented into their daily routines , using assessment data to develop action plans that tied these practices together . <p> In general , there was across the board interest among NSLMPY winners in doing what was best for students and assisting in student/learner quests for effective and valid information while keeping open the possibilities of effective learning regardless of student/learner status . Many of the winners have set up bodies of understanding within their school(s) and in the learning community about how to create a foundational continuum of information literacy that was a part of a student 's learning life no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TN , gathered best practices from their metropolitan area , collaborating not only with their own teachers but also with different school departments and community groups that celebrated this type of learning . <p> Biblioteca Las Americas , Mercedes , TX , established community services that helped everyone understand the school 's focus . <p> Kapolei High School , Kapolei , HI , used the services of various library staff personnel to help develop curriculum that was not only project-based , but strategically designed to support the concepts of life long learning to allow this to happen in the school and the community . They also orchestrated a " wish list " concept of needs of the school library with the Rotary Club , a strong community-based philanthropic organization . <p> Downer 's Grove High School , IL , worked to interact with every department at the school and delivered a uniform library curriculum for multiple subject areas . <p> L : NSLMPY CHARACTERISTICS The schools that won the NSLMPY award all had excellent programs that extended their worth into the worlds of others in and around the school . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and visions for their students and staff . They lived these missions on a daily basis . These missions were n't only theirs ; they were shared goals and foci of the school and its dedication to student learning . Most notably , Downer 's Grove High School believed in making the entire community a part of their agenda , providing service to all its constituents . <p> None of these award winners shied away from the onslaught of technology in their school ; rather , they embraced its arrival creating thoughtful and innovative connections to the school library . The programs were broad-based and had an outreach component that included everyone in the learning community . There was also assurance by the school that what the library did counted and mattered to all connected to the school . For example , Simsbury High School guaranteed the lessons it was involved with would have classroom content and authentic assessment work . <p> Also , the Norman School District modeled its work in a way that demonstrated commitment to learners and achievement . The district enlisted and got support for what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Another fundamental characteristic of the winners was their collaboration with building personnel-all personnel . Their planning and implementing of programs was designed collaboratively with those closest to the work they would do . For instance , Harpeth Hall worked not only with various committees that had members from the school as well as the community , but it also made a strong connection with higher education area institutions that could offer suggestions about their work . <p> The NSLMPY winners took time to analyze their collaborations and improve upon them , enlisting others to critically review the work and the progress made by learners . North Elementary School , Noblesville , IN , had regular meetings with grade level personnel to design instruction that would meet the learning needs of that set of learners . Biblioteca Las Americas shared information about how there were increases in resource use by learners , and how this information led them to upgrade their services . <p> Finally , there was an ambience of global ownership of the school library . Everyone seemed to share in the school library program work , regardless of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ libraries enhanced the programming they offered , and made the programming much more integral to every learner 's education . <p> Kapolei High School teamed , not only to provide resource services , but to be able to connect the learning process with the learning product for their learners , enlisting the assistance of community members and other schools in the complex to help with these designs . They also stayed on top of critical updates such as the Standards for 21st Century Learners , and offered them as an alignment component to consider . <p> No school library was seen as other than an integral part to the learning of every student ; no school library had difficulty facilitating the learning of each and every student given everyone 's depth of planning and ownership of the school library . <p> L : STEADFAST CHARACTERISTICS OF THESE SCHOOL LIBRARIES According to the information we received , consensus among these award winners seems to be that the greater learning community likes what it sees , and believes in the worth of the programs . Kapolei High School reported that it has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its win by continuing to hear and act upon the needs of the learner and the school . <p> Unfortunately , several schools reported that their library programs are anomalies to what is seen as a " regular " school library program . Luella Elementary talked about an author visit where the author himself felt the vibrancy of the program when he saw elementary kids using the school library in ways that empowered them toward information literacy independence . A former school administrator noted that he did not see such engaged learners in most school library programs he was familiar with . <p> It is clear that these programs are not only recognized for their outstanding value to the learning community , but also for their willingness to engage the learning community in ways that make them valuable to more than their particular school . <p> These schools report a high level of collaboration between the school library and the classroom . They see collaboration as the mechanism by which they are not only integral to the learning environment in the school , but also in the school library 's investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instituted practices and systems that ensure a high degree of collaboration with other instructors . <p> L : CHANGES TO THESE SCHOOL LIBRARY PROGRAMS SINCE THE AWARD Little has changed in many of these school library programs . Other than receiving the award and its monetary prize , these programs continue to build on what they have already . Although there are staffing cuts that are presently rampant in school libraries , the majority of these school library programs have seen little to no staffing changes . One school , Downer 's Grove High School has lost one librarian 's position , but attributes it to the district 's need to spend more of its budget on test skills as defined by the high stakes exams in place for its school district . However , Downer 's Grave 's awareness of their work and responsibility to student learning has not wavered -- staff still believes it is their core and their most important value . <p> In general , the school library programs are proud of their connections to their school and to their expertise in working with all learners at their schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of this award as well as their staffing . Biblioteca Las Americas mentioned it has added several technology enhancements as well as personnel upgrades because of what it came to know about their programs and what others saw as the reputation of this school library program . <p> Simsbury High School gave information about how the award money was spent to enhance the program already in place and how it has future intentions of using more monies in this way . <p> None of these award winners fear change , but rather , they embrace it . Each of them understands the need to stay abreast of change . The constant element is that they embrace changes that will further student achievement . As a matter of fact , Downer 's Grove High School writes : " Change defines our library . " <p> L : WHAT IS THE TAKE-AWAY FROM ALL OF THIS ? Clearly there was consensus that the power of the school library program is in its connections to learning , to all stakeholders , and to all decision-makers . This was especially so for Simsbury High @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in establishing expectations for the school library program . <p> There was also consensus that the school library program is n't " theirs " as much as something " they " manage for others . <p> All the award winners spoke about their very active , vibrant programming in the school library . Yet this active , vibrant programming had a very direct link with the expectations and visions of the entire educational community . From parents to classroom personnel , they understand that type of programming was not just a reaction to what was in place in the classroom , but was an integral part of the classroom learning environment . <p> The other issue that the award winners spoke about was having this type of vision and programming for much more than just the year in which it became an award winner . They have understood their " lessons learned " along the way , making their programming well-connected and well-respected by more than the school library , by more than the school-by all connected to learning in general . <p> There is n't an end to these programs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programs , the community continue to study and implement best practices that are most appropriate to meet the needs of their learners . You can too ! <p> So , we congratulate the 2005 to the present NSLMPY winners . We provide these tips as a means for everyone to consider what is happening with their school library program and how they might be a future winner of this coveted and prestigious award . <p> The three award categories are one District Award and two Single School Awards , changed in 2006 from Large District , Small District , and Individual School .
