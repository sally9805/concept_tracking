" In general , mankind , since the improvement of cookery , eats twice as much as nature requires . "  --  Benjamin Franklin <p> Her B12 Injections Are Being Questioned <p> Dear Dr. SerVaas : <p> I have been a victim of the " dumping syndrome " for over 30 years , when I had half of my stomach removed for an ulcer in the pyloric section . The letter in the March/April ' 94 issue from Bernice Hill of Concord , California , was the first time I have seen or heard anything about this terrible condition . The whole article , including your reply , is so helpful , and I am writing for the information offered by NDDIC ( National Digestive Diseases Information Clearinghouse ) . Since I have had many years of experience in dealing with this condition , I am offering some further help for anyone who may be in need of relief . <p> When I first became ill , there was little known about what happens when the pyloric valve is removed . I had many trips to emergency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treat the terrible nausea and pain . The ER doctor would start an IV to replace the body fluids and give me a relaxer by injection . After I was stabilized , I would go home and rest for several days . These drastic attacks are less frequent now due to the careful intake of food . One test , of the many I have had over the years , revealed I have a very high intolerance of lactose , which further limits the diet . I can not tolerate fish of any kind , and meat is very hard to digest , as well as fresh fruit and vegetables . I eat ( all cooked ) potatoes , vegetables , small amounts of chicken and bread . I use butter sparingly . I use all nondairy products and eat very few desserts , and then only a taste to satisfy the appetite for a sweet . <p> One more thing : the vitamin B12 does not assimilate through the digestive system , so I find B12 by injection is very helpful , especially now , since I am almost 79 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I would be happy to communicate with anyone who may need a kindred soul to support them , and I will pass all the information from NDDIC on to my doctor . <p> I deeply appreciate the attention you have given in the Post ( my favorite publication ) to this drastic condition . <p> There is recent news of an antibiotic which treats stomach ulcers , so perhaps in the near future there will be no need for this drastic surgery . <p> Louise Phillips Modesto , California <p> <p> <p> Thank you for your letter . We 've asked Dr. Christian Jansen to respond to your comments about B12 by injections . Dr. Jansen has been trying for more than 33 years to convince the medical establishment that B12 can be given just as well by mouth . His comments and related articles begin on page 46 of this issue . <p> Diabetic Concerns <p> Dear Dr. SerVaas : <p> I have a question about diabetes . I took a test given on TV that said : " Give yourself three points if you are constantly drinking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have to void 30 times a day . I do n't get up at night to go to the bathroom . ) Give yourself two points if you have periodic blurred vision . " <p> That gave me eight points , and Paula Zahn said , " If you have more than five points , then you might be at risk for diabetes . " I went to get a diabetes dipstick that I 've seen in the drugstore . I tested my urine , but the test showed no glucose . Can one be getting diabetes and still not have any glucose in the urine ? Is that sometimes late in the course of the disease ? <p> The doctor being interviewed said that one half of the people with diabetes do n't know they have it . Is the urine test sufficient to know that one is n't becoming a diabetic ? <p> Marcia Taylor Kansas City , Missouri <p> <p> <p> We went to Dr. Moazzam Habib with your questions on diabetes . Dr. Habib is a consultant in endocrinology and metabolism and is affiliated with St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> " In reply to your query regarding the possibility of your having diabetes and its not showing up on the urine test , I would like to explain the following to you . <p> " The urine test for sugar is the least sensitive test to diagnose diabetes mellitus . It will only show up positive if your blood sugar is above 200 or 250 ( depending on age ) . Therefore , if your blood sugar is , say , 150 or 180 ( high by any standards ) , it would still show up negative on the dip-stick . Also , this test is interfered with by other substances such as vitamin C. The more reliable test is to have a fasting or random blood sugar check . <p> " If you have suspicions regarding diabetes mellitus , I suggest you consult your local health practitioner . " <p> Symptoms of diabetes include excessive thirst , frequent urination , fatigue , unexplained weight loss , and occasional blurry vision . Your risk for developing the disease is increased if you are over 40 , overweight , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or have a parent or brother or sister with diabetes . <p> Diabetes mellitus affects about 10 million people in the United States , and probably another 10 million have the disease but do not know it . Some people may go five or six years before discovering their disease . The body is not able to change foods into the energy needed to keep it functioning properly . Complications of diabetes are a frequent cause of blindness and kidney failure . Although there is no known cure , diabetes can be controlled in most people by medications and lifelong attention to diet and exercise . <p> Excessive Sweating Is A Problem <p> Dear Dr. SerVaas : <p> I recently called your magazine seeking a solution to a medical problem my daughter is having , and they suggested I write to you directly . <p> For the majority of her teenage years and into her 20s , she has had a severe problem with sweating hands . This is not a normal case where , when nervous , they become damp . Instead , her normal , not-under-pressure hand condition is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands continually on her clothing to keep them dry enough to do homework , type on a computer , etc . <p> Then , when she comes under any stress at all , they will drip like a faucet . The stress can be just the thought of having to shake hands with another person she has just met , or having to hold hands around a family prayer circle . <p> I have taken her to a dermatologist repeatedly throughout the years , trying to find a cure for her problem , but to no avail . She has used Drysol for several rounds with no relief . The doctor has told her that Drysol is the strongest medicine he now has available . <p> I remember reading in the Post about being able to cure sweating feet with a tea therapy , although I can not recall exactly what you were to do . I was wondering if this therapy would cure her hands , even if they stain her hands for several weeks , or if you were aware of any new medicines she could use to stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cure that requires surgery to the back of the neck where , I believe , the nerves that control perspiration to the hands are located . In my opinion , this is simply too drastic of a step , but one that my daughter is seriously considering . <p> Thank you for your attention to this matter . I look forward to hearing from you at your convenience . <p> Kathryn H. Hunt Cleburne , Texas <p> <p> <p> Your daughter is suffering with localized hyperhidrosis , or excessive perspiration due to overactivity of the sweat glands in her palms . The cause of this condition is unknown and usually occurs in otherwise healthy individuals . Unfortunately , we are unaware of any treatment other than Drysol . Did she try covering the treated area at night with saran wrap held in place by a snug mitten or sock ? The treated area is then washed the following morning . Excessive sweating may be decreased after a couple of treatments before applying Drysol as needed . Perhaps our readers have other suggestions . <p> Vaginal Discomfort <p> Dear Dr. SerVaas : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vulvodynia or vulvar vestibulitis . This is a constant and terrible burning in the vulvar area of her vagina . This is caused by the crystallization of calcium oxalate in her diet . Even though she is on a strict diet , she has no relief . Doctors do n't seem to know much about this problem . Can you help ? <p> Name and hometown withheld <p> <p> <p> Dear Dr. SerVaas : <p> Thank you for an excellent magazine . Most helpful is the " Medical Mailbox " each month . I clip and save this part when the magazine gets old . <p> For nine years now , after seeing five gynecologists and three dermatologists , and after all kinds of tests , I 've been diagnosed as having burning vulva syndrome . Very little seems to be known at this time . At the present , I 'm trying mixed creams  --  three parts betamethasone 0.1 percent to one part Eurax ( at times very painful ) . <p> Any information you can give will be appreciated . Do you know if research is being done on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Name and hometown withheld <p> <p> <p> We forwarded your letters to Robert A. Munsick , M.D. , Ph.D. , Indiana University ( IU ) Medical Center Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology . He has a special interest in this condition , and his comments follow : <p> " The causes of chronic , continuous vulvar pain can run from herpes zoster infections ( shingles ) , to neuritic pain originating from the spine to the vulva , to vitamin deficiencies , to skin disorders , to vaginal and vulvar infections , to scars from previous operations , to recurrent injury , to allergic reaction to perfumes , detergents , semen or saliva , to hysterical or psychological pain . <p> " My recommendation is to obtain an opinion from a gynecologist or dermatologist who is highly reputed in the treatment of vulvar diseases . <p> " In reference to the first letter , if the pain is indeed constant and not particularly related to sexual intercourse , tampon insertion , or tight-fitting pants , it does not sound like the usual case of ' vulvar vestibulitis , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evaluation is mandatory . What does your doctor say about the problem , and does he or she have a consultant to recommend ? " <p> C. William Hanke , M.D. , at the IU Medical Center Dermatology Department offered this additional advice : <p> " Vulvodynia , or burning vulvar syndrome , is a frustrating problem for patients , spouses , and physicians . There are multiple causes . It can affect women in their 20s to women in their 80s . There are no magic cures , but a precise diagnosis can lead to treatment that is more likely to be effective . It is ideal if a patient can consult both a dermatologist and gynecologist . Oftentimes , a university dermatology department will have a faculty person who has a special interest in this type of problem .

The Vulvar Pain Foundation publishes a newsletter for patients . <p> Cured of Irritable Bowel Syndrome <p> Dear Dr. SerVaas : <p> I was extremely interested in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the May/June ' 94 issue of The Saturday Evening Post , as I accidently cured my chronic diarrhea ( irritable bowel syndrome ) with amoxicillin and aspirin . <p> I was given amoxicillin for a sinus infection . ( I have no record of the amount . ) At the same time , I had a bad back after yard work and was taking 375 mg acetylsalicylic acid , 15 mg caffeine , and 8 mg codeine approximately twice per day for the pain in my back . <p> The antibiotic I took for ten days , and the painkiller for about a week . Since that time  --  about five years ago  --  I have had more or less normal bowel movements about twice a day . <p> Mary J. Foxton Sparks , Nevada <p> <p> Impact of Incontinence <p> Dear Dr. SerVaas : <p> We were ecstatic to see the complete and wonderful coverage of inflammatory bowel disease that was done in the Jan. /Feb. ' 94 issue . As an enterostomal therapist , I have long been involved in the care of patients with IBD who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every aspect of the presentation of the disease and the good and the tragic outcomes were superb . <p> That leads me to the second purpose of this letter , which is to say I think that now the Post is perfectly poised to give in-depth coverage to the problems , treatments , and management options associated with urinary and bowel incontinence . As you know , incontinence affects up to 25 million Americans and exacts an enormous economic , psychologic , and health toll on those who suffer from it , their caregivers , and our nation . One of your writers , Carol Krucoff , is quite familiar with the subject . <p> I would be delighted to put you in touch with physician and nurse authorities on the subject and patients who are all too willing to discuss the impact of incontinence on their daily lives . You might be interested to know that one man with post-prostatectomy incontinence was so devastated and frustrated by his situation that he gave HIP a grant of $22,000 for the purpose of developing a model for a multispecialty continence clinic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promulgating this information . <p> Dr. SerVaas , the time is right . The subject needs the kind of coverage that you have shown that you can give to a condition that has heretofore been " untouchable " because of its lack of glamour and/or because of societal stigma and taboo . Thank you for rising to this challenge ! <p> Katherine F. Jeter , Ed.D. , Executive Director HIP ( Help for Incontinent People ) Spartanburg , South Carolina <p> <p> Scratching the Surface <p> Dear Dr. SerVaas : <p> I have the identical itching problem described by Ruth Steppe from Madison , Indiana , included in your Jan. / Feb. ' 94 issue . <p> I have suffered from this problem for years . The itching is worse at night . I am taking Chlor-Trimeton at bedtime , and I think it helps a little . Doctors just shake their heads . <p> For six years , I have been on a daily maintenance dose of Macrodantin ( which I take at dinnertime ) to control a chronic urinary tract infection . Somehow I feel there is a connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be no way I can get off the Macrodantin . If Ruth Steppe finds a solution , I would like to hear from her . <p> Junile Seeling Santa Ana , California <p> <p> <p> Dear Dr. SerVaas : <p> Regarding Ruth Steppe of Madison , Indiana , whose scalp and face itched so badly . . . I have had the same problem and for ages did n't know the cause or treatment . It began when I was a child and seemed to become worse when I was in a crowd of people , making me think it was stress-related , until I noticed it was bad in the car with my mother and at home when both parents were home . . . and then I noticed it was when I was with people who smoke ! <p> Low doses of antihistamines , avoiding smokers when they are smoking , and frequent shampooing solved it for me ! Hers may be a smoke allergy or another airborne substance . <p> Catherine Cline Jacksonville , Florida <p> <p> Terrifying Moles <p> Dear Dr. SerVaas : <p> First , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people : " The Saturday Evening Post is T-O-P-S ! " <p> In my old age , I especially like the medical pages . I learn much from reading other people 's troubles  --  with the answers given . <p> My problem is moles  --  by the hundreds-on my back , neck , and arms . The dermatologists I have seen tell me it is hereditary and recommend lotions twice a day . <p> The daily problem with them is itching . When a new one starts as a little red bump , it itches on and on  --  terrifying ! <p> If you find anyone who hears about or knows of any treatment that might work , I would like to hear it . <p> Thanks for your contribution to the health of the subscribers , and may God bless you for editing a magazine with a tone of old-fashioned " goodness . " <p> Lura M.
