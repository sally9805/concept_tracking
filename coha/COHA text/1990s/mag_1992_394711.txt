A small , faint smudge of light adorned the photographic plate . Using the 18-inch Schmidt telescope on Palomar Mountain , astronomers Eugene and Carolyn Shoemaker and David Levy were searching for Earth-crossing asteroids  --  small but potentially dangerous objects whose orbits intersect that of Earth . As they scanned a plate exposed on the morning of October 6 , 1991 , looking for the telltale motion of an Earth-crosser , they came across the smudge . Located in western Perseus , this was no ordinary smudge . It was the light from a comet no one had ever seen Named Comet Shoemaker-Levy after its discoverers , the comet spent most of the next eight months slowly looping through the constellation Andromeda . Now it is poised to make a mad dash across Earth 's northern sky . During June and much of July , Comet Shoemaker-Levy shines brighter than 10th magnitude and lies far enough north that observers at mid-northern latitudes can watch it throughout the entire night . Then , in the second half of July , the comet shines at its brightest as it passes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' predictions , it may then be bright enough to glimpse with the naked eye . IN THE DARK OF THE NIGHT The key to getting a good view of the comet is to choose a good observing site . For Comet Shoemaker-Levy , that means getting as far away from city lights as you can . The glow from bright artificial lighting can nearly wash out faint , fuzzy objects like comets . If you want to spot Shoemaker-Levy with your naked eye , you 'll need a pitch-black site . But even if you plan on using a telescope to observe the comet , a dark sky will afford you a much better view . In the same way that artificial lights make comet hunting difficult , so does the natural light of a bright Moon . Avoid observing on nights when the Moon brightens the sky . The comet 's northerly position in June and early July helps in this regard . If the Moon is bright in the evening sky , plan on observing the comet before dawn . Likewise , a bright Moon in the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Except on nights near the Full Moon , you can outmaneuver the Moon simply by picking the proper observing time . When the comet moves south in late July , it also moves into the evening sky . Fortunately the Moon is a morning object during this period , so you should still get a good view . To get the best view of Shoemaker-Levy , however , bring along binoculars . A pair of 7x35 or larger binoculars will gather enough light to make the comet appear distinct against the starry background , even if the comet does n't quite live up to expectations . Binoculars are also the instrument of choice for viewing the comet 's tail . Though Shoemaker-Levy probably wo n't produce a spectacular tail ( it wo n't get close enough to the Sun for that ) , the tail could easily span a few degrees . Binoculars provide a wide enough field of view to show you the entire comet at once . If you want to view details in the tail or get a closeup look at structure in the coma or gaseous jets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability and magnification of a telescope . A good 6-inch or larger instrument at medium to high magnifications should offer a superb view . A GUESSING GAME Unfortunately , it 's nearly impossible to predict how bright Comet Shoemaker-Levy will get . The magnitudes cited in this article are based on astronomers ' best predictions of what will happen as the comet approaches the Sun . However , the comet could easily prove to be a couple of magnitudes brighter or fainter than the values given . There 's nowhere near as much uncertainty in the position of Shoemaker-Levy . Astronomers have enough observations to calculate a good orbit for the comet , so the positions shown on the map on pages 76 and 77 should be right on . The altitudes and azimuths given below are for an observer located at 40deg north latitude . This approximates the view across the central United States and southern Europe . The time to start observing Shoemaker-Levy comes after the Full Moon in mid-June . By June 20 , the Moon has waned enough to allow you to spot the 8th-magnitude comet in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears 21deg above the northern horizon as evening twilight ends . The comet becomes easier to see toward the end of June , when the Moon is New and the comet stands more than 30deg high both when evening twilight ends and morning twilight begins . On the 24th , Shoemaker-Levy passes from Cassiopeia into the barren reaches of Camelopardalis , which will make spotting the comet easier . HEADING SOUTH July offers the best opportunities for viewing Comet Shoemaker-Levy because it is brightest then and well placed in the evening sky . The first good observing window this month runs from the 1st to around the 11th . As in June , the comet is visible in both the evening and morning skies . Though the comet is higher at the end of evening twilight  --  about 35deg above the northern horizon in the evening compared with 30deg or less in the morning  --  the morning view is better once the Moon reaches First Quarter phase on the night of July 6/7 . This eleven-day period sees the comet hovering around 7th magnitude , bright enough to see easily in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 79deg ) on June 29 , Shoemaker-Levy in July begins heading south as well as east . On the 5th , it leaves Camelopardalis behind and moves into Ursa Major , where it is destined for some exciting conjunctions with deep-sky objects . On the night of July 6/7 , Shoemaker-Levy passes less than 2deg northeast of the bright pair of galaxies M81 and M82 . This is a perfect chance for astrophotographers who want to capture the comet along with these favorite deep-sky objects . Although observing comets near the time of the Full Moon is not easy , some excellent conjunctions in mid-July make it worth the effort . On the night of July 12/13 , Shoemaker-Levy passes just over 1deg north of the bright galaxy M108 . On the following night , the comet passes 0.5deg east of M97 , the Owl Nebula . The next good observing window opens around July 20 and lasts until the end of the month . This is when Shoemaker-Levy is at its brightest , peaking at a predicted magnitude of 6.5 . If conditions are perfect or if the comet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to spot it with your naked eye . Shoemaker-Levy continues its rapid motion southward now and moves out of the circumpolar sky and into the evening sky . Look for the comet between 15deg and 30deg above the western horizon as twilight comes to a close . Though Shoemaker-Levy has no particularly exciting conjunctions during this period , with the comet at its brightest and our view of the tail at its best , this could be an exciting time for comet observers . The odds of a long tail are slim because Shoemaker-Levy does n't get that close to the Sun , but if a tail does develop , this is the time to look for it . Once August begins , viewing conditions deteriorate rapidly . Not only does the Moon return to the evening sky , but Shoemaker-Levy continues its plunge to the south . By August 13 , the comet sets before evening twilight ends . As the Sun 's glare swallows it from view , we 'll all look back on the comet 's brief visit . It certainly wo n't make us forget the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lucky and it meets or exceeds expectations , we 'll all remember it fondly .
