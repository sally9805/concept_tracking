Tupac Shakur is dead , but gangsta rap is n't . Yet . Shakur 's posthumous CD , The Don Killuminati : The 7 Day Theory , which he recorded under the name Makaveli , entered the Billboard charts at No. 1 . Last week Snoop Doggy Dogg released his new CD , Tha Doggfather , another likely big seller . <P> But neither of these albums , both on Death Row Records , delivers the goods . The 7 Day Theory boasts complex production and some great tunes but is overwhelmed by exhausted gangsta imagery . As for Tha Doggfather , some of the songs have a narcotic seductiveness , and Snoop slips in a few positive messages . But much of the album is boorish and boring . <P> One reason is that Snoop 's innovative ex-producer , Dr. Dre , has moved beyond Snoop , beyond gangsta rap ( a genre he helped found ) and beyond Death Row Records for a new venture : Aftermath Entertainment , a label that will explore genres like soul and pop . Dre 's new CD , Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , features performers from his label , from soul singers Kim Summerson and RC to rappers Nowl and Sharief . <P> Dre , who produced the CD , gives all the music gangsta grit  --  minus much of the usual gangsta venom . Dre contributes one solo performance on the record , the brooding Been There Done That , which takes a swipe at the gangsta genre . " I try out some different things on this album , " Dre says . " Yeah . It will surprise some people . "  --  C.J.F.
