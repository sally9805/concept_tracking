Like the vampires , ghouls , rabid dogs and other monsters that populate his fiction , Stephen King seems practically unstoppable . New novels appear with almost supernatural speed , take a choke hold on the best-seller lists , and are transformed into movies that typically make a quick blitz at the box office before settling into a long , lucrative life on the video shelves . For an impressive array of filmmakers , from Brian De Palma to Rob Reiner , King has made an ideal collaborator : he provides the sprawling , imaginative raw material ; they bring the cinematic compression and sometimes ( as in Stanley Kubrick 's The Shining ) the resonance of art . <P> Television , however , handles King clumsily . ABC 's four-hour version of It ( childhood friends battle nameless evil , personified by Tim Curry as a malevolent clown ) was bloated and out of control , while The Tommyknockers ( more nameless evil , this time chasing Jimmy Smits ) seemed derivative and halfhearted . Still , both were big hits in the ratings . At a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tales , King 's dark , fanciful ( though still moralistic ) stories seem liberating . <P> The Stand , airing on ABC next week , is the biggest TV serving of King yet . Based on his 800-page 1978 novel ( to which the author restored 400 previously cut pages in 1990 ) , it spans four nights and eight hours and portrays nothing less than the end of the world as we know it . King 's horrors , as usual , are firmly rooted in the everyday . The opening scene sets the tone . At a government lab nestled in a quiet California desert community , a security guard gets a panicked alarm : the containment of a deadly experimental virus has been breached . Instead of triggering the security system , the guard races across the manicured lawns , grabs his wife and baby and bolts off in a car before the area can be quarantined . <P> He is the unwitting carrier of a germ that causes flulike symptoms and sudden , grisly death in almost everyone who comes in contact with it . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a series of short , effective scenes that hopscotch around the country  --  a small town in East Texas , a disease-control lab in Vermont , the streets of New York City  --  the plague spreads , causing death , panic , chaos . Practically all that remains of civilization is talk-radio etiquette . A radio host ( Kathy Bates ) , enraged about the " superflu " cover-up , takes calls from panicked listeners who tell of dying babies and mass body burnings . Says one caller : " First of all ( ( cough ) ) , I just want to tell you that I love your show . . . " <P> The first two hours of The Stand , which Mick Garris directed from a screenplay by King , are as gripping as anything in recent TV memory . But after the cities have been cleaned out , the mini-series mutates into a more tepid apocalyptic soap opera . The narrative coalesces around a few disparate survivors ( who have an unexplained immunity to the flu ) , among them an easygoing Texan ( Gary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Molly Ringwald ) , a rock singer ( Adam Storke ) and an angelic deaf-mute ( Rob Lowe ) . The few people left are mystically drawn into two camps : one led by a messiah- like black woman ( Ruby Dee ) , the other by a satanic " dark man " ( a leonine Jamey Sheridan ) .
