SERIOUSLY . <p> " Sam , run some forks through the dishwasher fast and I 'll be your love-slave , " promised Julie . <p> Sam considered . " Thrown in half a cheesecake and it 's a done deal . You got anything good on that tray ? " <p> Julie looked . " Half-eaten slice of blueberry pie ? " <p> " Give it here . " Sam wiped a hand the size of a sugar-cured ham on the tail of his apron , lifted the pie from the plate and shoved it home . " Oh , I 'm in the mood for love ... , " he sang when he could speak , wagging himself like a happy Saint Bernard as he took Julie 's tray from her hands and sorted its contents - silverware into one rack , plates into another , glasses into a bucket of solvent . Julie snatched the napkins and other trash out of the way , then abandoned the steamy clatter of the scullery for the air-conditioned muzak of the dining room . She looked at her watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three hours ? Her back hurt , her feet hurt , her head hurt . Four years in college and four in an office had left her unfit for this kind of work . Sam had caught her three nights ago - her first night on the job - leaning her head against the side of the food locker with half a broken plate in her hand , ready to weep with fatigue and frustration after three hours of work . He had given her a thump on the shoulder , taken charge of the plate , and promised her by the end of a week she 'd be able to do this job in her sleep . Julie had n't taken him literally , thank God , but at least the work was resolving itself into a series of comprehensible systems . As she learned to fall into step with the waitresses , the cook , and the boys in the kitchen , she was finding it easier to work without making a mess or getting upset . <p> Julie understood at some level that her psyche was making less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her limit . She realized , of course , that it was n't she who had failed . It was a soft economy , and one industry taking a hit . She was n't less of a person because she was temporarily out of a job . She had a dozen resumes wafting in as many promising directions , even as she spooned chocolate pudding and speared preserved cherries . She was working the night shift to keep her days free for the interviews she knew would be coming . <p> Her decision to take this kind of job at all had astonished her friends - especially Laurel , her sleek , well-groomed corporate mentor . Three years older than Julie , she was three years higher up the organizational ladder . Laurel seemed to think the aura of hourly labor might follow a woman into a head-hunter 's office and ruin her chances . Julie , however , had looked at her severance package , made a realistic assessment of the number of months she could keep up the mortgage on her condo , and decided that a job doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a depressed real estate market . <p> It was also the case - though Julie was keeping this to herself - that five weeks into this lay-off she had begun to experience panic . She gave up the charade of holding open a book or pretending to listen to the radio at night . Instead , she 'd lie awake , thinking . There was no one to talk to at one in the morning , and there were a lot of hours to get through before it was time to get up and make phone calls . <p> Lately , it seemed , there were fewer and fewer people to talk to in the daytime . To her friends at the office she had become the walking , breathing embodiment of everyone 's nightmare . To her friends identity recently amputated and the wound not yet fully healed . No one , of course , had pushed her away ; there were even three or four of her friends who included her now in their " duty calls " one night a week . Bright , optimistic calls that took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a ward for the chronically crippled . She hated the feeling . <p> So , go out and get a job , any job if it 's honest work . She 'd done it in college , she could certainly do it again - put on a uniform and take that long leap backward to the point in her life when everything was a problem and she could n't do anything right . <p> Sam had been the saving grace , that first night . The cook had a temper , the hostess had an attitude , the other waitresses had children at home and defended their tips with their lives . Waiting tables in a place like Henry 's was three-quarters free enterprise : you sized up the customers according to established restaurant demographics - stake your claim on the guys with their dates , ignore , if you could , the women eating alone - and processed them through your station like an express train . The experienced waitresses could n't be expected to help her to their own disadvantage . Julie learned she could count on Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all their tables ; and along with the forks she could count on a grin and a snatch of some old happy song . <p> Sam was an anomaly in a restaurant kitchen - too old an much too cheerful . He was large0boned and heavy , with as much grizzled black-and grey hair on his face as his head . He was never impatient , he never seemed rushed , yet the only time she was him at absolute rest was during his break . Then he would load up a plate with anything he thought he could get past the cook , hunker down at the table the waitresses used to clean shrimp and sort our their checks , consume his meal in eight or ten minutes of steady mechanical labor , then bury his head in his folded arms and sit motionless for the rest of his hour . <p> Tonight Julie came through the scullery with a nearly untouched piece of cheesecake amidst the dinner debris on her tray . She found the dishwasher silent and Sam sound asleep at his table in the corner of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch him consume leftovers of unknown origin , but now it was like much else about this whole scene - a story to tell at a party once she returned to the " land of the living , " but nothing that merited serious inspection right now . She looked at the cheesecake , the trash can , then at Sam 's damp , sleeping from . Finally , she emptied the cheesecake into a clean paper napkin and left her offering on the table , where Sam would see it ahead of the cook . <p> Julie ostensibly worked till one-thirty , but one night a week in rotation , each waitress stayed late to wash tables and chairs . This night was Julie 's . Sam stayed late every night to break down the grill and scour the kitchen , and in addition he superintended the dinning room clean-up . Tonight , as the hostess drew down the blinds and checked the receipts in the drawer , Sam filled a bucket with ammonia and wate for Julie and found her some rags . He gave her a run-down of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own monstrous job in the kitchen . Julie worked hard for over an hour and when , at last , she carried the bucket to the scullery , her arms were so tried they shook . Sam had finished the grill and the floor , and was sitting at this table cleaning the bottom of a pot with a piece of steel wool . " All done ? " he asked , setting the pot aside as she emptied her bucket in the scrub sink . <p> " I did n't realize I was holding you up . You want to go check it out ? " <p> " Lady , I do n't want to check anything out but my bed and my pillow right now . Hit that light on your way out . " <p> " You know , you did n't have to wait ... " <p> " No problem . You parked around back ? " <p> " Yeah . Can I give you a lift anywhere ? " <p> " Thank you kindly , " san Sam with big grin . " I generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sam , " Julie asked as she started the car , " how long have you worked at this place ? " <p> Sam considered . " Be three year in August . " <p> " Can I ask a personal question ? " <p> Sam shrugged . <p> " What 's the attraction ? " <p> " Oh , that 's easy , " Sam laughed . " The food . " <p> Julie started at him . " Half-eaten cheesecake and blueberry pie ? " <p> " Any anything else that offers itself . Three thousand calories a day do n't come cheap , " he said . " You can take it from me . " <p> " Sam , " she laughed , " three thousand calories would last me the better part of a week ! " <p> " Lady , when you walk past that dishwasher with that first tray of food in your arms , I 've already put in a ten-hour day and I 'm still a good thee hours away from my dinner . I 'll eat anything I can catch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked back at the road . " This is sounding a little too weird ? " he asked , echoing her thoughts with uncanny accuracy . " I work nights because there 's no electricity where I live , and I need the daylight hours for other pursuits . And I work in a restaurant so I don ' have to cook for myself . Anything else I can answer ? " <p> " Not unless you 're willing to tell me about those other pursuits . " <p> " Piqued your curiosity , hey ? That 's my mystique - I always like to keep'em guessing . Hang the next right ; it 's the warehouse there on the corner . " <p> Julie hung the next right , pulled up to the loading dock in back of a warehouse , and studied her passenger . " I give up , " she conceded at last . <p> " You mean all your acquaintances do n't live in warehouses ? " he laughed . He opened the car door and slid our into the night . " Thanks for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your at work . " <p> Julie drove home , got into bed , and slept like the dead ' til the phone rang . Groggy , she lifted the receiver with one hand as she felt with the other for her watch . It was laurel at the office , and it was almost half-past nine . <p> " Hey , Julie , how 's tricks ? " she asked brightly . " I called you last night . " <p> " I 'm working now , remember ? Night shift at Henry 's ? " <p> " You actually look that job ? " <p> " Well , Luarel , I have to pay my mortgage . " <p> " What if you get called for an interview today , and you have to sit across the desk from somebody and you smell like ... like boiled shrimp ? And what about your manicure ? Do n't waitresses all get red hands and broken nails ? You do n't want some guy in a Brooks Brothers suit to think you work in a restaurant ... " <p> Laurel knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay to listen to her . Laurel knew everything about getting around in the world . She was the only who had hired Julie , and warned her right at the start to make herself known as " Julia " at the office . Laurel had paid a man back for calling her " Laurie " by doing exactly the same to him - calling him " Tommy " or " Bobby " or " Kenny " in meetings till the man took the hint . She was good at her job , fiding ways to persuade elderly clients to gamble on stock ; she was better at keeping track of the skeletons her colleagues kept in their closets . She had a nice office , a beautiful wardrobe , and an apartment that could have been featured in Decorator 's Digest . <p> " I 'm trying to be careful , " said Julie earnestly . " I 'm rinsing my hair with lemon and every morning I redo my nails . I think I 'll be okay in a job interview . " <p> " Well , I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Even if I would n't have done it myself . But here 's why I called . You remember how I always tell you to keep a mole in the personnel office ? I have n't been taking those ladies boxes of chocolates at Christmas for nothing . Edna called me up yesterday . She says there 's a job opening up in Capital Markets . If you put on your little blue suit and get down here today before the posting goes out ... " <p> Julie was already out of bed and yanking clothes form the closet . She showered and dressed , put on her make-up , and was sitting in an interview an hour and ten minutes later . She did n't get the job . There was , in fact , no job to be had . There had been position , already effectively filled , which , for reasons of affirmative action , had to be posted , but there was n't a job . Dejected , Julie went home and changed clothes for the restaurant . <p> It was not a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sam left an underling in charge of the dishes and divided his time between the scullery and the cook . In the resulting confusion Julie let a customer slip without without paying her check ; and , a long with the information that it would cost her half a night 's take-home , the hostress relayed a customer 's complaint that the soup she 'd brought from the kitchen was barely lukewarm . <p> Angry and discouraged , Julie fled the dining room and ran smack into Sam in transit from freezer to sink . " Excuse me , " said Julie with what grace she could manage , " I needed a new rack of glasses . " <p> " Eddie , " called Sam to the boy at the dishwasher , " lean out the door and tell Helen to cover her tables . " Julie he steered by the elbow to the kitchen 's back door , saying , " Let 's take a walk . " They went out past the dumpsters to the parking lot and leaned against Julie 's car in the gathering dusk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same casual interest she had shown in his personal life . " Is it safe to assume you are n't planning a career working the night shift at Henry 's ? " <p> Julie laughed a little in spite of her gloom . " Yeah , that would be a safe bet . " <p> " May I ask what you do in real life ? " <p> " In real life ? Well , in what I used to call my real life I worked as a marketing statistician for a brokerage house . It was a little bit dull , but it had the advantage of being a dependable source of income . " <p> Sam nodded . " It 's really a shock to wake up one morning and find out you 're not who you thought . " <p> Sam spoke as one who had been there . Maybe he had , but Julie was n't yet ready to buy such an apocalyptic view of her lay-off . " It 's just a matter of hanging on till the economy picks up a little . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sam . One of these days I 'll get it all back . I 'll have my life together just like it was . " <p> " Well , that 's fine , Julie . We only get one shot at this ; it 's good to know what life we want to life . " <p> Julie looked at Sam in the restaurant floodlight and discovered she felt somewhat better . They went back to work , and later that night she somehow made too much milkshake for one of her customers . She poured the extra into a glass and discreetly took it to Sam with her next load of dishes . <p> He repaid the favor the following evening ; he broke for dinner when Julie sat down to de-vein a big bowl of shrimp , and when he had finished his meal he worked along with her . As they peeled , they talked . <p> " Tell me something , Sam , " she said finally . " You do n't strike me as a man born and educated to work in a restaurant kitchen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Seriously ? " <p> " Seriously , I was an accountant . I came through a car wreck a few years back and took a long look at my life . Now I work with stained glass . " <p> " Stained ... ? " <p> " Glass . It started our as therapy ; now it 's an obsession . I make stained glass windows . " <p> " Mm . " Julie considered , and asked politely , " Who for ? " <p> " Who for ? " Sam repeated the words as if searching for meaning . <p> " I mean , are you a contractor ? Do you work for somebody ? Who do you sell to ? " <p> " Ah . Well , to tell you the truth I have n't finished one yet so it is n't a problem . " <p> Julie reflected , as she picked at the shrimp , that this was one strange character . Also , that she would never eat shrimp again in any disguise . " So , " she said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warehouse . Would you tell me about them ? " <p> " My windows ? Well , I have two of them , actually . When I was a kid someone took me for a walk in a forest right after a snowstorm . I 've never seen anything like the sun on the snow in that forest . So I have a snow window . " <p> " Is n't that kind of monochromatic ? " asked Julie . " For stained glass , I mean . " <p> " Julie , I 've got some pieces of sky so blue they 'd knock your socks off . Red berries , cardinals , some evergreen boughs , and where the sun hits an icicle there 's every color in the rainbow . " <p> " How big ? " asked Julie , trying to imagine all this in a normal-sized window . <p> " About twenty feet by thirty , which accounts for the living arrangements . And then there 's the other : a rain forest with flowers and birds , and that 's nothing but color . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick my environment to suit my mood for the day . " <p> " How long , " Julie asked , " does it take to finish a twenty-by-thirty-foot window ? " <p> " Well , " Sam replied , " since I have n't finished one yet , I ca n't really say . Another two or three years . " <p> " And then what ? " <p> Sam shrugged . " Find an architect who wants to design a building around an incredible window ? " <p> " Have you had many offers ? " <p> " No , but I ca n't say I 'm putting much effort behind it . " <p> " If you are n't in a hurry to sell them ... why do you make them ? " <p> Sam took his time as he worked on the shrimp , but eventually he answered the question . " Did you ever , " he asked , " see something so beautiful you could n't get it out of your mind ? Did you live with it and play with it over the years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times ? And then one day did you sit up in bed and say to yourself , I want this thing to have an existence somewhere outside my own head ' ? " <p> No , Julie could n't say she 'd had that experience . As she worked through the rest of the evening , then drove herself home and got ready for bed , she tried to remember the last time she 'd done a single original thing . She fell asleep wondering and woke up , yet again , to the sound of the telephone ringing . It was Laurel . <p> " Julie , I 'm so sorry I ca n't speak , " she exclaimed . <p> That 'll be the day , thought Julie ; then reproached herself for disloyalty . She could hear the rapid tick-tick of Laurel 's fingers on her keyboard : the woman was a good enough friend to call her up on a busy workday . Laurel was trying to help , and she ought to be civil . <p> " Nothing ventured , nothing gained , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going to make it all up to you . I 've got a line on a job that I know is for real . It 's in our department . " <p> " Okay , " said Julie , skeptical after her too-recent wild goose chase . " Tell me about it . " <p> " Well , you 'd be working for Tommy Parker ... " <p> Tommy Parker ? Laurel had to be kidding . " Laurel , " said Julie , " you have to be kidding . I trained that yutz two years ago . " <p> " Julie , a job is a job ... " <p> " And this is no job , it 's a sentence , " said Julie , suddenly surprised at herself . " Thanks , I 'll give it a miss . " <p> " Sounds like somebody 's giving you goofy advice , " said Laurel severely . " Have you met a guy ? " <p> " Well ... in a manner of speaking , " said Julie , to tease her . " Last night I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What 's this guy do ? " <p> " He washes dishes , Laurel , and he lives in a warehouse without any lights , and he spends all his time making stained glass windows that nobody buys . Look , I 'm going back to sleep for a while . I 'll give you a call later . " <p> Nothing much happened the next several days , except that Julie got into the habit of overestimating when she made milkshakes , and Sam got into the habit of timing his breaks to coincide with her own . Julie talked to him about her apartment , about her former job and her friends at the office . Sam talked about his trip across Europe , where he 'd seen the cathedral windows that had claimed his whole life . They talked about books , they talked about school , they talked about everything they knew . Sam , it turned out , had seen quite a bit of the world and done many things . Julie , who had passed unremarkable from high school to college to work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As if suddenly shaken awake by Sam 's energy and his sense of adventure , Julie slowly abandoned filling up her time obsessively calling on head-hunters . She went to the library and to the zoo . She spent a day in the sculpture hall of the museum looking at tombs . She began reading National Geographic and the travel section of the Sunday newspaper . After about a week of this , it began to down on her that paying the mortgage on a small urban condo was a rather tame goal for a person with health and youth and no obligations . <p> One night , after she and Sam had worked late together and she gave him a lift in her car , she said , as she drove toward the freight yards down by the river , " So ... do you ever let anyone look at these windows of yours ? Like , for instance , someone who showed up around dinner time on your night off with a steak and a cheesecake ? " <p> She held her breath for the answer , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Julie , " Sam said at last , and he sounded regreful , " I do n't run into many ethical dilemmas in my line of work . There 's something I want to be sure you understand . I 'm not the solution to the problem you 're having right now . I can be a friend , if that 's what you need , but you 're at a vulnerable point in your life and I have a hunch that 's not what you want . " <p> There was , of course , truth here , but right at the moment it was lost in the sting of rejection . " Night , Sam , " said Julie , angry and injured , slamming the car into reverse before Sam cleared the door . " I 'll see you at work . " <p> Julie stopped talking Sam half-cups of milkshake , and Sam took the hint and stopped taking his breaks when she did . He did n't stop smiling or singing , however . Julie thought about taking a course in watercolor painting or applying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she wallpapered the bedroom in her condo and started researching trips she could take . <p> One day while she was nosing around the library for something to read , she discovered they carried a number of foreign newspapers . Intrigued , she gathered an armload of the ones she could read and sat down at a table . From force of habit she sought the job listings , and suddenly the other shoe dropped . <p> Five weeks later she work up once again to an early-morning telephone call . She had to lean over Sam - asleep on her floor with maps and guidebooks around him - to reach the receiver . " Hey ! " chirped Laurel from her office downtown . Julie could hear the ceaseless ring of the stock brokers ' phone bank . " I called you again last night . You 're not still waiting tables ? " <p> " Not after Friday , " said Julie . " I gave them my notice . " <p> " Atta girl ! " Now , here 's the thing . Tommy Parker got everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means his job 's available , and if you walked in now they 'd hire you back in a minute . Same job you left , and a little more money . Julie , it 'll be just like it was . " <p> " Laurel , I 'm going away in a week and a half . I do n't need a job . " <p> " Away ? Like , to visit your sister ? " Laurel asked absently . Julie could almost see her mouthing instructions at her secretary , thumbing through a stack of messages . <p> " Not , away like I 'm flying to Auckland . There 's a family who 's going to be living in Singapore and Tunisia for the next year , and they need a travelling tutor for their twelve-year-old daughter . " <p> Silence , while Laurel refocused her attention and came to terms with this freakish development . At last she asked mournfully , " Seriously , Julie ? " <p> " Seriously . I 've already rented my condo , " said Julie . <p>    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
