My apartment in New York was on Perry Street , a five minute walk from the White Horse . I often drank there , but I was never accepted because I wore a tie . The real people wanted no part of me . I did some drinking there on the night I left for San Juan . Phil Rollins , who 'd worked with me , was paying for the ale , and I was swilling it down , trying to get drunk enough to sleep on the plane . Art Millick , the most vicious cab driver in New York , was there . So was Duke Peterson , who had just come back from the Virgin Islands . I recall Peterson giving me a list of people to look up when I got to St. Thomas , but I lost the list and never met any of them . It was a rotten night in the middle of January , but I wore a light cord coat . Everyone else had on heavy jackets and flannel suits . The last thing I remember is standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Rollins and cursing the freezing wind that blew in off the river . Then I got in Millick 's cab and slept all the way to the airport . I was late and there was a line at the reservations desk . I fell in behind fifteen or so Puerto Ricans and one small blonde girl a few places ahead of me . I pegged her for a tourist , a wild young secretary going down to the Caribbean for a two week romp . She had a fine little body and an impatient way of standing that indicated a mass of stored-up energy . I watched her intently , smiling , feeling the ale in my veins , waiting for her to turn around for a swift contact with the eyes . She got her ticket and walked away toward the plane . There were still three Puerto Ricans in front of me . Two of them did their business and passed on , but the third was stymied by the clerk 's refusal to let him carry a huge cardboard box on the plane as hand baggage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke in . " Hey ! " I shouted . " What the hell is this ? I have to get on that plane ! " The clerk looked up , disregarding the shouts of the little man in front of me . " What 's your name ? " I told him , got my ticket , and bolted for the gate . When I got to the plane I had to shove past five or six people waiting to board . I showed my ticket to the grumbling stewardess and stepped inside to scan the seats on both sides of the aisle . Not a blonde head anywhere . I hurried up to the front , thinking that she might be so small that her head would n't show over the back seat . But she was n't on the plane and by this time there were only two double seats left . I fell into one on the aisle and put my typewriter on the one next to the window . They were starting the engines when I looked out and saw her coming across the runway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . " Wait a minute ! " I shouted . " Another passenger ! " I watched until she reached the bottom of the steps . Then I turned around to smile as she came on . I was reaching for my typewriter , thinking to put it on the floor , when an old man shoved in front of me and sat down in the seat I was saving . " This seat 's taken , " I said quickly , grabbing him by the arm . He jerked away and snarled something in Spanish , turning his head toward the window . I grabbed him again . " Get up , " I said angrily . He started to yell just as the girl went by and stopped a few feet up the aisle , looking around for a seat . " Here 's one , " I said , giving the old man a savage jerk . Before she could turn around the stewardess was on me , pulling at my arm . " He sat on my typewriter , " I explained , helplessly watching the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plane . The stewardess patted the old man 's shoulder and eased him back to the seat . " What kind of a bully are you ? " she asked me . " I should put you off ! " I grumbled and slumped back in the seat . The old man stared straight ahead until we got off the ground . " You rotten old bastard , " I mumbled at him . He did n't even blink , and finally I shut my eyes and tried to sleep . Now and then I would glance up at the blonde head at the front of the plane . Then they turned out the lights and I could n't see anything . It was dawn when I woke up . The old man was still asleep and I leaned across him to look out the window . Several thousand feet below us the ocean was dark blue and calm as a lake . Up ahead I saw an island , bright green in the early morning sun . There were beaches along the edge of it , and brown swamps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced that we should all buckle our safety belts . Moments later we swept in over acres of palm trees and taxied to a halt in front of the big terminal . I decided to stay in my seat until the girl came past , then get up and walk with her across the runway . Since we were the only white people on the plane , it would seem quite natural . The others were standing now , laughing and jabbering as they waited for the stewardess to open the door . Suddenly the old man jumped up and tried to scramble over me like a dog . Without thinking , I slammed him back against the window , causing a thump that silenced the crowd . The man appeared to be sick and tried to scramble past me again , shouting hysterically in Spanish . " You crazy old bastard ! " I yelled , shoving him back with one hand and reaching for my typewriter with the other . The door was open now and they were filing out . The girl came past me and I tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the window until I could back into the aisle . He was raising so much hell , shouting and waving his arms , that I was tempted to belt him in the throat to calm him down . Then the stewardess arrived , followed by the co-pilot , who demanded to know what I thought I was doing . " He 's been beating that old man ever since we left New York , " said the stewardess . " He must be a sadist . " They kept me there for ten minutes and at first I thought they meant to have me arrested . I tried to explain , but I was so tired and confused that I could n't think what I was saying . When they finally let me go I slunk off the plane like a criminal , squinting and sweating in the sun as I crossed the runway to the baggage room . It was crowded with Puerto Ricans and the girl was nowhere in sight . There was not much hope of finding her now and I was not optimistic about what might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a man of my stripe , a brutalizer of old people . I remembered the expression on her face when she saw me with the old man pinned against the window . It was almost too much to overcome . I decided to get some breakfast and pick up my baggage later on . The airport in San Juan is a fine , modern thing , full of bright colors and suntanned people and Latin rhythms blaring from speakers hung on naked girders above the lobby . I walked up a long ramp , carrying my topcoat and my typewriter in one hand , and a small leather bag in the other . The signs led me up another ramp and finally to the coffee shop . As I went in I saw myself in a mirror , looking dirty and disreputable , a pale vagrant with red eyes . On top of my slovenly appearance , I stank of ale . It hung in my stomach like a lump of rancid milk . I tried not to breathe on anyone as I sat down at the counter and ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early sun . Beyond it a thick palm jungle stood between me and the ocean . Several miles out at sea a sailboat moved slowly across the horizon . I stared for several moments and fell into a trance . It looked peaceful out there , peaceful and hot . I wanted to go into the palms and sleep , take a few chunks of pineapple and wander into the jungle to pass out . Instead , I ordered more coffee and looked again at the cable that had come with my plane ticket . It said I had reservations at the Condado Beach Hotel . It was not yet seven o'clock , but the coffee shop was crowded . Groups of men sat at tables beside the long window , sipping a milky brew and talking energetically . A few wore suits , but most of them had on what appeared to be the uniform of the day  --  thick-rimmed sunglasses , shiny dark pants and white shirts with short sleeves and ties . I caught snatches of conversation here and there : " ... no such thing as cheap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gentlemen ... do n't worry , he has plenty , and all we need is ... sewed up , but we got ta move quick before Castro and that crowd jumps in with ... " After ten minutes of half-hearted listening I suspected I was in a den of hustlers . Most of them seemed to be waiting for the seven-thirty flight from Miami , which  --  from what I gathered of the conversations  --  would be bulging at the seams with architects , strip-men , consultants and Sicilians fleeing Cuba . Their voices set my teeth on edge . I have no valid complaint against hustlers , no rational bitch , but the act of selling is repulsive to me . I harbor a secret urge to whack a salesman in the face , crack his teeth and put red bumps around his eyes . Once I was conscious of the talk I could n't hear anything else . It shattered my feeling of laziness and finally annoyed me so much that I sucked down the rest of my coffee and hurried out of the place . The baggage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had a porter carry them out to the cab . All the way through the lobby he favored me with a steady grin and kept saying : " S , Puerto Rico est bueno ... ah , s : , muy bueno ... mucho ha-ha , s ... " In the cab I leaned back and lit a small cigar I 'd bought in the coffee shop . I was feeling better now , warm and sleepy and absolutely free . With the palms zipping past and the big sun burning down on the road ahead , I had a flash of something I had n't felt since my first months in Europe  --  a mixture of ignorance and a loose , " what the hell " kind of confidence that comes on a man when the wind picks up and he begins to move in a hard straight line toward an unknown horizon . We were speeding along a four-lane highway . Stretching off on both sides was a vast complex of yellow housing developments , laced with tall cyclone fences . Moments later we passed what looked like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses . There was a billboard at the entrance , announcing to all travelers that they were passing the El Jippo Urbanizacin . A few yards from the billboard was a tiny shack made of palm fronds and tin scraps , and beside it was a hand-painted sign saying " Coco Fro " Inside , a boy of about thirteen leaned on his counter and stared out at the passing cars . Arriving half-drunk in a foreign place is hard on the nerves . You have a feeling that something is wrong , that you ca n't get a grip . I had this feeling , and when I got to the hotel I went straight to bed . It was four-thirty when I woke up , hungry and dirty and not at all sure where I was . I walked out on my balcony and stared down at the beach . Below me , a crowd of women , children and pot-bellied men were splashing around in the surf . To my right was another hotel , and then another , each with its own crowded beach . I took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The restaurant was closed , so I tried the bar . It showed every sign of having been flown down intact from a Catskill mountain resort . I sat there for two hours , drinking , eating peanuts and staring out at the ocean . There were roughly a dozen people in the place . The men looked like sick Mexicans , with thin little mustaches and silk suits that glistened like plastic . Most of the women were Americans , a brittle-looking lot , none of them young , all wearing sleeveless cocktail dresses that fit like rubber sacks . I felt like something that had washed up on the beach . My wrinkled cord coat was five years old and frayed at the neck , my pants had no creases and , although it had never occurred to me to wear a tie , I was obviously out of place without one . Rather than seem like a pretender , I gave up on rum and ordered a beer . The bartender eyed me sullenly and I knew the reason why  --  I was wearing nothing that glistened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apple . In order to make a go of it here , I would have to get some dazzling clothes . At six-thirty I left the bar and walked outside . It was getting dark and the big Avenida looked cool and graceful . On the other side were homes that once looked out on the beach . Now they looked out on hotels and most of them had retreated behind tall hedges and walls that cut them off from the street . Here and there I could see a patio or a screen porch where people sat beneath fans and drank rum . Somewhere up the street I heard bells , the sleepy tinkling of Brahms ' Lullaby . I walked a block or so , trying to get the feel of the place , and the bells kept coming closer . Soon an ice-cream truck appeared , moving slowly down the middle of the street . On its roof was a giant popsicle , flashing on and off with red neon explosions that lit up the whole area . From somewhere in its bowels came the clanging of Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driver grinned happily and blew his horn . I immediately hailed a cab , telling the man to take me to the middle of town . Old San Juan is an island , connected to the mainland by several causeways . We crossed on the one that comes in from Condado . Dozens of Puerto Ricans stood along the rails , fishing in the shallow lagoon , and off to my right was a huge white shape beneath a neon sign that said Carib Hilton . This , I knew , was the cornerstone of The Boom . Conrad had come in like Jesus and all the fish had followed . Before Hilton there was nothing ; now the sky was the limit . We passed a deserted stadium and soon we were on a boulevard that ran along a cliff . On one side was the dark Atlantic , and , on the other , across the narrow city , were thousands of colored lights on cruise ships tied up at the waterfront . We turned off the boulevard and stopped at a place the driver said was Plaza Coln @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two bills . He looked at the money and shook his head . " What 's wrong ? " I said . He shrugged . " No change , seor . " I felt in my pocket  --  nothing but a nickel . I knew he was lying , but I did n't feel like taking the trouble to get a dollar changed . " You goddamn thief , " I said , tossing the bills in his lap . He shrugged again and drove off . The Plaza Coln was a hub for several narrow streets . The buildings were jammed together , two and three stories high , with balconies that hung out over the street . The air was hot , and a smell of sweat and garbage rode on the faint breeze . A chatter of music and voices came from open windows . The sidewalks were so narrow that it was an effort to stay out of the gutter , and fruit vendors blocked the streets with wooden carts , selling peeled oranges for a nickel each . I walked for thirty minutes , looking into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , peering into foul bars full of whores and sailors , dodging people on the sidewalks , thinking I would collapse at any moment if I did n't find a restaurant . Finally I gave up . There seemed to be no restaurants in the Old City . The only thing I saw was called the New York Diner , and it was closed . In desperation , I hailed a cab and told him to take me to the Daily News . He stared at me . " The newspaper ! " I shouted , slamming the door as I got in . " Ah , s , " he murmured . " El Diario , s . " " No , goddamnit , " I said . The Daily News  --  the American newspaper  --  El News . " He had never heard of it , so we drove back to Plaza Coln , where I leaned out the window and asked a cop . He did n't know either , but finally a man came over from the bus stop and told us where it was . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no sign of a newspaper , and I suspected he was bringing me down here to get rid of me . We turned a corner and he suddenly hit his brakes . Just ahead of us was some kind of a gang-fight , a shouting mob , trying to enter an old greenish building that looked like a warehouse . " Go on , " I said to the driver . " We can get by . " He mumbled and shook his head . I banged my fist on the back of the seat . " Get going ! No move  --  no pay . " He mumbled again , but shifted into first and angled toward the far side of the street , putting as much distance as possible between us and the fight . He stopped as we came abreast of the building and I saw that it was a gang of about twenty Puerto Ricans , attacking a tall American in a tan suit . He was standing on the steps , swinging a big wooden sign like a baseball bat . " You rotten little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of movement and I heard the sound of thumping and shouting . One of the attackers fell down in the street with blood on his face . The large fellow backed toward the door , waving the sign in front of him . Two men tried to grab it and he whacked one of them in the chest , knocking him down the steps . The others stood away , yelling and shaking their fists . He snarled back at them : " Here it is , punks  --  come get it ! " Nobody moved . He waited a moment , then lifted the sign over his shoulder and threw it into their midst . It hit one man in the stomach , driving him back on the others . I heard a burst of laughter , then he disappeared into the building . " Okay , " I said , turning back to the driver . " That 's it  --  let 's go . " He shook his head and pointed at the building , then at me . " S , est News . " He nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said gravely . It dawned on me that we were sitting in front of the Daily News  --  my new home . I took one look at the dirty mob between me and the door , and decided to go back to the hotel . Just then I heard another commotion . A Volkswagen pulled up behind us and three cops got out , waving long billyclubs and yelling in Spanish . Some of the mob ran , but others stayed to argue . I watched for a moment , then gave the driver a dollar and ran into the building . A sign said the News editorial office was on the second floor . I took an elevator , half expecting to find myself lifted into the midst of more violence . But the door opened on a dark hall , and a little to my left I heard the noise of the city room . The moment I got inside I felt better . There was a friendly messiness about the place , a steady clatter of typewriters and wire machines , even the smell was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empty , although I could see at least ten people . The only one not working was a small , black-haired man at a desk beside the door . He was tilted back in a chair , staring at the ceiling . I walked over and as I started to speak he jerked around in the chair . " All right ! " he snapped . " What the fuck are you after ? " I glared down at him . " I start work here tomorrow , " I said . " My name 's Kemp , Paul Kemp . " He smiled faintly . " Sorry  --  thought you were after my film . " " What ? " I said . He grumbled something about being " robbed blind , " and " watching it like a hawk . " I glanced around the room . " They look normal . " He snorted . " Thieves  --  packrats . " He stood up and held out his hand . " Bob Sala , staff photographer , " he said . " What brings you in tonight ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He smiled . " You broke ? " " No , I 'm rich  --  I just ca n't find a restaurant . " He dropped back in his chair . " You 're lucky . The first thing you learn here is to avoid restaurants . " " Why ? " I said . " Dysentery ? " He laughed . " Dysentery , crabs , gout , Hutchinson 's Disease  --  you can get anything here , anything at all . " He looked at his watch . " Wait about ten minutes and I 'll take you up to Al 's . " I moved a camera out of the way and sat down on his desk . He leaned back and stared again at the ceiling , scratching his wiry head from time to time and apparently drifting off to some happier land where there were good restaurants and no thieves . He looked out of place here  --  more like a ticket-taker at some Indiana carnival . His teeth were bad , he needed a shave , his shirt was filthy , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We sat there in silence until two men came out of an office on the other side of the room . One was the tall American I 'd seen fighting in the street . The other was short and bald , talking excitedly and gesturing with both hands . " Who 's that ? " I asked Sala , pointing at the tall one . He looked . " The guy with Lotterman ? " I nodded , presuming the short one to be Lotterman . " His name 's Yeamon , " said Sala , turning back to the desk . " He 's new  --  got here a few weeks ago . " " I saw him fighting outside , " I said . " A bunch of Puerto Ricans jumped him right in front of the building . " Sala shook his head . " That figures  --  he 's a nut . " He nodded . " Probably mouthed off at those union goons . It 's some kind of a wildcat strike  --  nobody knows what it means . " Just then Lotterman called across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sala did n't look up . " Nothing  --  I 'm off in three minutes . " " Who 's that with you ? " Lotterman asked , eyeing me suspiciously . " Judge Crater , " Sala replied . " Might be a story . " " Judge who ? " said Lotterman , advancing on the desk . " Never mind , " said Sala . " His name is Kemp and he claims you hired him . " Lotterman looked puzzled . " Judge Kemp ? " he muttered . Then he smiled broadly and held out both hands . " Oh yes  --  Kemp ! Good to see you , boy . When did you get in ? " " This morning , " I said , getting off the desk to shake hands . " I slept most of the day . " " Good ! " he said . " That 's very smart . " He nodded emphatically . " Well , I hope you 're ready to go . " " Not right now , " I said . " I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  tomorrow . I would n't put you to work tonight . " He laughed again . " No , I want you boys to eat " He smiled down at Sala . " I suppose Bob 's going to show you the town , eh ? " " Sure I am , " said Sala . " Do it on the old expense account , eh ? " Lotterman laughed nervously . " You know what I mean , Bob  --  let 's try to be civil . " He turned and waved at Yeamon , who was standing in the middle of the room , examining a rip in the armpit of his coat . Yeamon came toward us with a long bow-legged stride , smiling politely when Lotterman introduced me . He was tall , with a face that was either arrogant or something else that I could n't quite place . Lotterman rubbed his hands together . " Yessir , Bob , " he said with a grin . " We 're getting a real team together , eh ? " He slapped Yeamon on the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communist bastards outside , " he said . " They 're savage  --  they should be locked up . " Sala nodded . " They 'll kill one of us pretty soon . " " Do n't say that , Bob , " said Lotterman . " Nobody 's going to be killed . " Sala shrugged . " I called Commissioner Rogan about it this morning , " Lotterman explained . " We ca n't tolerate this sort of thing  --  it 's a menace . " " Damn right it is , " Sala replied . " To hell with Commissioner Rogan  --  we need a few Lugers . " He stood up and pulled his coat off the back of the chair . " Well , time to go . " He looked at Yeamon . " We 're going up to Al 's  --  you hungry ? " " I 'll be up later on , " Yeamon replied . " I want to check by the apartment and see if Chenault 's still asleep . " " Okay , " said Sala . He waved me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go out the back way  --  I do n't feel like a fight . " " Be careful , boys , " Lotterman called after us . I nodded and followed Sala into the hall . At the rear of the building a stairway led down to a metal door . Sala poked at it with a pocket knife and it swung open . " Ca n't do it from outside , " he explained as I followed him into the alley . His car was a tiny Fiat convertible , half eaten away by rust . It would n't start and I had to get out and push . Finally it kicked over and I jumped in . The engine roared painfully as we started up the hill . I did n't think we 'd make it , but the little car staggered manfully over the crest and started up another steep hill . Sala seemed unconcerned with the strain , riding the clutch whenever we threatened to stall . We parked in front of Al 's and went back to the patio . " I 'm getting three hamburgers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serves . " I nodded . " Anything  --  I need bulk . " He called to the cook and told him we wanted six hamburgers . " And two beers , " he added . " Real quick . " " I 'll have rum , " I said . " Two beers and two rums , " Sala shouted . Then he leaned back in his chair and lit a cigarette . " You a reporter ? " " Yeah , " I said . " What brings you down here ? " " Why not ? " I replied . " A man could do worse than the Caribbean . " He grunted . " This is n't the Caribbean  --  you should have kept on going south . " The cook shuffled across the patio with our drinks . " Where were you before this ? " Sala asked , lifting his beers off the tray . " New York , " I said . " Before that , Europe . " " Where in Europe ? " " All over  --  mainly Rome and London . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah , " I said . " I had a fill-in job for six months . " " You know a guy named Fred Ballinger ? " he asked . I nodded . " He 's here , " Sala said . " He 's getting rich . " I groaned . " Man , what a jackass . " " You 'll see him , " he said with a grin . " He hangs around the office . " " What the hell for ? " I snapped . " Sucks up to Donovan . " He laughed . " Claims he was sports editor of the Daily American . " " He was a pimp ! " I said . Sala laughed . " Donovan threw him down the stairs one night  --  he has n't been around for a while . " " Good , " I said . " Who 's Donovan  --  the sports editor ? " He nodded . " A drunkard  --  he 's about to quit . " " Why ? " He laughed . " Everybody quits  --  you 'll quit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He shook his head . " People dropping out like flies . I 've been here longer than anybody  --  except Tyrrell , the city editor , and he 's going soon . Lotterman does n't know it yet  --  that 'll be it  --  Turrell 's the only good head left . " He laughed quickly . " Wait till you meet the managing editor  --  ca n't even write a headline . " " Who 's that ? " I said . " Segarra  --  Greasy Nick . He 's writing the governor 's biography . Any time of the day or night he 's writing the governor 's biography  --  ca n't be disturbed . " I sipped my drink . " How long have you been here ? " I asked him . " Too long , more than a year . " " Could n't be too bad , " I said . He smiled . " Hell , do n't let me throw you off . You may like it  --  there 's a type that does . " " What type is that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The wheelers and the dealers  --  they love it here . " " Yeah , " I said . " I got that feeling at the airport . " I looked over at him . " What keeps you here ? It 's only forty-five dollars to New York . " He snorted . " Hell , I make that much in an hour  --  just for punching a button . " " You sound greedy , " I said . He grinned . " I am . There 's nobody on the island greedier than me . Sometimes I feel like kicking myself in the balls . " Sweep arrived with our hamburgers . Sala grabbed his off the tray  --  and opened them up on the table , throwing the lettuce and tomato slices into the ashtray . " You brainless monster , " he said wearily . " How many times have I told you to keep this garbage off my meat ? " The waiter stared down at the garbage . " A thousand times ! " Sala shouted . " I tell you every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a smile . " You should leave  --  this place is getting to you . " He gobbled one of his hamburgers . " You 'll see , " he muttered . " You and Yeamon  --  that guy 's a freak . He wo n't last . None of us will last . " He slammed his fist on the table . " Sweep  --  more beer ! " The waiter came out of the kitchen and looked at us . " Two beers ! " Sala yelled . " Hurry ! " I smiled and leaned back in the chair . " What 's wrong with Yeamon ? " He looked at me as if it were incredible that I should have to ask . " Did n't you see him ? " he said . " That wild-eyed sonofabitch ! Lotterman 's scared shitless of him  --  could n't you see it ? " I shook my head . " He looked okay to me . " " Okay ? " he shouted . " You should have been here a few nights ago ! He flipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table . " He slapped our table with his palm . " No damn reason , " he repeated . " Knocked all our drinks in the dirt and flipped the table on some poor bastard who did n't know what he was saying  --  then threatened to stomp him ! " Sala shook his head . " I do n't know where Lotterman found that guy . He 's so scared of him that he lent him a hundred dollars and Yeamon went out and blew it on a motorscooter . " He laughed bitterly . " Now he 's brought some girl down here to live with him . " The waiter appeared with the beers and Sala snatched them off the tray . " No girl with any brains would come here , " he said . " Just virgins  --  hysterical virgins . " He shook his finger at me . " You 'll turn queer in this place , Kemp  --  mark my words . This place will turn a man queer and crazy . " " I do n't know , " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me . " I smiled . " I think I 'll look around for her tomorrow . She 's bound to be on the beach somewhere . " " She 's probably a lesbian , " he replied . " This place is full of them . " He shook his head . " It 's the tropic rot  --  this constant sexless drinking ! " He slumped back in his chair . " It 's driving me wild  --  I 'm cracking up ! " Sweep came hurrying out with two more beers and Sala grabbed them off the tray . Just then Yeamon appeared in the doorway ; he saw us and came over to the table . Sala groaned miserably . " Oh god , here he is , " he muttered . " Do n't stomp me , Yeamon  --  I did n't mean it . " Yeamon smiled and sat down . " Are you still bitching about Moberg ? " He laughed and turned to me . " Robert thinks I mistreated Moberg . " Sala grumbled something about " nuts . " Yeamon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Juan . How old are you , Robert  --  about ninety ? " " Do n't give me your crazy shit ! " Sala shouted , springing up from his chair . Yeamon nodded . " Robert needs a woman , " he said gently . " His penis is pressing on his brain and he ca n't think . " Sala groaned and shut his eyes . Yeamon tapped on the table . " Robert , the streets are full of whores . You should look around sometime . I saw so many on the way up here that I wanted to grab about six and fall down naked and let them crawl all over me like puppies . " He laughed and signaled for the waiter . " You bastard , " Sala muttered . " That girl has n't been here a day and you 're already talking about having whores crawl on you . " He nodded wisely . " You 'll get the syphilis  --  you keep on whoring and stomping around and pretty soon you 'll stomp in shit . " Yeamon grinned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sala looked up . " Is she still asleep ? How long before I can go back to my own apartment ? " " Soon as we leave here , " Yeamon replied . " I 'll take her on out to the house . " He nodded . " Of course I 'll have to borrow your car  --  too much luggage for the scooter . " " Jesus , " Sala muttered . " You 're a plague , Yeamon  --  you 'll suck me dry . " Yeamon laughed . " You 're a fine Christian , Robert . You 'll get your reward . " He ignored Sala 's snort and turned to me . " Did you come in on the morning plane ? " " Yeah , " I said . He smiled . " Chenault said there was some young guy beating up an old man on the plane with her  --  was that you ? " I groaned , feeling the web of sin and circumstance close down on the table . Sala eyed me suspiciously . I explained that I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to crawl over me . Yeamon laughed . " Chenault thought you were the lunatic  --  claimed you kept staring at her , then ran amok on the old man  --  you were still beating him when she got off the plane . " " Jesus Christ ! " Sala exclaimed , giving me a disgusted look . I shook my head and tried to laugh it off . The implications were ugly  --  a crazed masher and a slugger of old men  --  not the kind of introduction a man wants to make for himself on a new job . Yeamon seemed amused , but Sala was plainly leery . I called for more drinks and quickly changed the subject . We sat there for several hours , talking , drinking lazily , killing the time while a sad piano tinkled away inside . The notes floated out to the patio , giving the night a hopeless , melancholy tone that was almost pleasant . Sala was sure the paper was going to fold . " I 'll ride it out , " he assured us . " Give it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assignments and then he was off , probably to Mexico City . " Yeah , " he said , " figure about a month , then we start packing . " Yeamon shook his head . " Robert wants the paper to fold so he 'll have an excuse to leave . " He smiled . " It 'll last a while . All I need is about three months  --  enough money to take off down the islands . " " Where ? " I asked . He shrugged . " Anywhere  --  find a good island , someplace cheap . " Sala hissed . " You talk like a caveman , Yeamon . What you need is a good job in Chicago . " Yeamon laughed . " You 'll feel better when you get humped , Robert . " Sala grumbled and drank his beer . I liked him , in spite of his bitching . I guessed he was a few years older than I was , maybe thirty-two or - three , but there was something about him that made me feel like I 'd known him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not quite as close  --  more like a memory of somebody I 'd known in some other place and then lost track of . He was probably twenty-four or - five and he reminded me vaguely of myself at that age  --  not exactly the way I was , but the way I might have seen myself if I 'd stopped to think about it . Listening to him , I realized how long it had been since I 'd felt like I had the world by the balls , how many quick birthdays had gone by since that first year in Europe when I was so ignorant and so confident that every splinter of luck made me feel like a roaring champion . I had n't felt that way in a long time . Perhaps , in the ambush of those years , the idea that I was a champion had been shot out from under me . But I remembered it now and it made me feel old and slightly nervous that I had done so little in so long a time . I leaned back in the chair and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen and for some reason the piano had stopped . From inside came a babble of Spanish , an incoherent background for my scrambled thoughts . For the first time I felt the foreignness of the place , the real distance I had put between me and my last foothold . There was no reason to feel pressure , but I felt it anyway  --  the pressure of hot air and passing time , an idle tension that builds up in places where men sweat twenty-four hours a day .
