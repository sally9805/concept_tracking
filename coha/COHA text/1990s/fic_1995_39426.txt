RAYNELLE Bullfinch told the young oiler that the only sense of mystery in her life was provided by a deck of cards . As she set up the table in the engine room of the Leo B. Canterbury , a government steam dredge anchored in a pass at the mouth of the Mississippi River , she lectured him . " Nick , you 're just a college boy sitting out a bit until you get money to go back to school , but for me , this is it . " She pulled a coppery braid from under her overalls strap , looked around at the steam chests and piping , and sniffed at the smell of heat-proof red enamel . In the glass of a steam gauge she checked her round , bright cheeks for grease and ran a white finger over the blue arcs of her eyebrows . She was the cook on the big boat , which was idle for a couple of days because of high winter winds . " My big adventure is cards . One day I 'll save up enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those folding chairs , " she told him . " Seven in all . " <p> " I do n't know how to play bourree , ma'am . " Nick Montalbano ran a hand through long hair shiny with dressing . " I only had one semester of college . " He looked sideways at the power straining the bronze buckles of the tall woman 's bib and avoided her green eyes , which were deepset and full of intense judgment . <p> " Bullshit . A pet rat can play bourree . Sit down . " She pointed to a metal chair , and the oiler , a thin boy wearing an untucked plaid flannel shirt and a baseball cap , obeyed . " Pay attention here . I deal out five cards to everybody , and I turn up the last card . Whatever suit it is , that 's trumps . Then you discard all your nontrumps and draw replacements . Remember , trumps beat all other suits , high trumps beat low trumps . Whatever card is led , you follow suit . " She ducked her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes . " This ai n't too hard for you , is it ? Ai n't college stuff more complicated than this ? " <p> " Sure , sure . I understand . But what if you ca n't follow suit ? " <p> " If nontrumps is led , put a trump on it . If you ai n't got no more trumps , just throw your lowest card . Trust me  --  you 'll catch on quick . " <p> " How do you win ? " The oiler turned his cap around . <p> " Every hand has five tricks to take . If you take three tricks , you win the pot , unless only two decide to play that hand after the draw . Then you need four tricks . If you got any questions , ask Sidney there . " <p> Sidney , the chief engineer , a little fireplug of a man who would wear a white T-shirt in a blizzard , sat down heavily with a whistle . " Oh , boy . Fresh meat . " He squeezed the oiler 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triple-expansion engine opened , letting in a wash of frigid air around the day fireman , pilot , deckhand , and welder , who came into the big room cursing and clapping the cold out of their clothes . Through the door the angry whitecaps of Southwest Pass raced down the Mississippi , bucking into the tarnished Gulf sky . <p> " Close that damned pneumonia-hole , " Raynelle cried , sailing cards precisely before the seven chairs . " Sit down , worms . Usual game : dollar ante , five-dollar rip if you do n't take a trick . " After the rain of halves and dollars came discards , more dealing , and then a flurry of cards ending with a rising snowstorm of curses as no one took three tricks and the pot rolled over to the next hand . Three players took no tricks and put up the five-dollar rip . <p> The engineer unrolled a pack of Camels from his T-shirt sleeve and cursed loudest . " I heard of a bourree game on a offshore rig where the pot did n't clear for eighty-three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had seventeen hundred dollars in it . The next day the genius what took it got a wrench upside the head in a Morgan City bar and woke up with his pockets inside out and the name Conchita tattooed around his left nipple . " <p> Pig , the day fireman , put up his ante and collected the next hand . " That ai n't nothin ' . " He touched three discards to the top of his bald head and threw them down . " A ol ' boy down at the dock told me the other day that he heard about a fellow got hit in the head over in Orange , Texas , and did n't know who he was when he looked at his driver 's license . Had amnesia . That sorry-ass seamen 's hospital sent him home to his scuzz-bag wife , and he did n't know her from Adam 's house cat . " <p> " That mighta been a blessing , " Raynelle said , sending him three cards in a flock . She rolled left on her ample bottom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day fireman said , unzipping his heavy green field jacket . " That gal told him she was his sister , gave him a remote control and a color TV ; he was happy as a fly on a pie . She started bringin ' boyfriends in at night , and that fool waved them into the house . Fixed ' em drinks . Figured any old dude good enough for Sis was good enough for him . The neighbors got to lookin ' at her like they was smellin ' somethin ' dead , so she and her old man moved to a better trailer park where nobody knew he 'd lost his memory . She started into cocaine , and hookin ' for fun on the side . Her husband 's settlement money he got from the company what dropped a thirty-six-inch Stillson wrench on his hard hat began to shrink up a bit , but that old boy just sat there dizzy on some cheap pills she told him was a prescription . He 'd channel surf all day , greet the johns like one of those old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a bitch in Orange , Texas . " The day fireman spread wide his arms . " Was he glad to see Sis come home every day . He was proud she had more friends than a postman with a bag full of welfare checks . And then his memory came back . " <p> " Ho , ho , the merde hit the blower , " the engineer said , slamming a queen down and raking in a trick . <p> " Nope . That poor bastard remembered every giggle in the rear bedroom and started feelin ' lower than a snake 's nuts . He tried to get his old woman straight , but the dyed-over tramp just laughed in his face and moved out on him . He got so sorry he went to a shrink , but that just cost him more bucks . Finally , you know what that old dude wound up doin ' ? He looked for someone would hit him in the head again  --  you know , so he could get back the way he was . He offered a hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people will whack on you for free , so you can imagine what kind of service he bought hisself . After nearly gettin ' killed four or five times , he give up and spent the rest of his settlement money on a hospital stay for a concussion . After that he held up a Pac-a-Bag for enough money to get himself hypmotized back to like he was after he got hit the first time . Wound up in the pen doin ' twenty hard ones . " <p> They played three hands of cards while the day fireman finished the story , and then the deckhand in the game , a thick blond man in a black cotton sweater , threw back his head and laughed , ha ha , as if he were only pretending . " If that wadn ' so funny , it 'd be sad . It reminds me of this dumb-ass peckerwood kid lived next to me in Kentucky , built like a stringbean . He was a few thimbles shy of a quart , but he sort of knew he wadn ' no nuclear-power-plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started hangin ' with these bad-ass kids  --  you know , the kind that carry spray paint , wear their hats backward , and stuff live rats in your mailbox . Well , they told the poor bastard he was some kind of Jesse James and got him into stealin ' hubcaps and electric drills . He started struttin ' around the neighborhood like he was bad news at midnight , and soon the local deputies had him in the back seat for runnin ' off with a lawn mower . Dummy stole it in December . " <p> " What 's wrong with that ? " the day fireman asked , pitching in a dollar . <p> " Who 's gon na buy a used mower in winter , you moron ? Anyway , the judge had pity on him , gave him a two-bit fine and sent him to bed with a sugar-tit . Said he was a good boy who ought to be satisfied to be simple and honest . But Stringbean hung out on the street corner crowin ' . He was proud now . A real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of swamp gas by these losers he 's hangin ' around with . Finally one night he breaks into the house of a gun collector . Showin ' how smart he is , he chooses only one gun to take from the rack  --  an engraved Purdy double-barrel , mint condition , with gold and ivory inlays all over , a twenty-thousand-dollar gun . Stringbean took it home and with a two-dollar hacksaw cut the stock off and then most of the barrel . He went out and held up a taco joint and got sixteen dollars and thirteen cents . Was arrested when he walked out the door . This time a hard-nut judge sent him up on a multiple bill and he got two hundred ninety-seven years in Bisley . " <p> " All right , " Raynelle sang . " Better than death . " <p> " He did ten years before the weepy-ass parole board noticed the sentence and pulled him in for review . Asked him did he get rehabilitated and would he go straight if he got out , and he spit on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dummy and would be the richest bank robber in Kentucky if he got half a chance . " The deckhand laughed , ha ha . " That give everybody an ice-cream headache , and the meetin ' came to a vote right quick . Even the American Civil Liberties lesbo lawyers on the parole board wanted to weld c the door shut on him . It was somethin ' . " <p> THE pilot , a tall man wearing a pea jacket and a sock cap , raised a new hand to his sharp blue eyes and winced , keeping one trump and asking for four cards . " Gentlemen , that reminds me of a girl in Kentucky I knew at one time . " <p> " Why ? Did she get sent up two hundred ninety-seven years in Bisley ? " the deckhand asked . <p> " No , she was from Kentucky , like that crazy fellow you just lied to us about . By the way , that king wo n't walk , " he said , laying down an ace of diamonds . " This woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell in love with one of her patients , a good-looking , mild-mannered fellow with a cyst in his brain that popped and gave him amnesia . " <p> " Now , there 's something you do n't hear every day , " the engineer said , trumping the ace with a bang . <p> " He did n't know what planet he came from , " the pilot said stiffly . " A few months later they got married and he went to work in a local iron plant . After a year he began wandering away from work at lunchtime . So they fired him . He spent a couple of weeks walking up and down his street and all over Louisville looking into people 's yards and checking passing buses for the faces in the windows . It was like he was looking for someone , but he could n't remember who . One day he did n't come home at all . For eighteen months this pretty little nurse was beside herself with worry . Then her nephew was at a rock concert downtown and spotted a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just standing there like he was watching a string quartet . Between songs the nephew asked the shaggy guy if he had amnesia , which is a rather odd question , considering , and the man almost started crying , because he figured he 'd been recognized . " <p> " That 's a sweet story , " the day fireman said , rubbing his eyes with his bear-paw-sized hands . " Sidney , could you loan me your handkerchief ? I 'm all choked up . " <p> " Choke this , " the pilot said , trumping the fireman 's jack . " Anyway , the little nurse gets attached to the guy again and is glad to have him back . She refreshes his memory about their marriage and all that and starts over with him . Things are better than ever , as far as she is concerned . Well , about a year of marital bliss goes by , and one evening there 's a knock at the door . She gets up off the sofa where the amnesia guy is. opens it , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Wait a minute , " the deckhand said . " I thought that was her husband on the sofa . " <p> " I never said it was her husband . She just thought it was her husband . It turns out that the guy on the sofa she 's been living with for a year is the identical twin to the guy on the doorstep . Got an identical popped cyst , too . " <p> " Aw , bullshit , " the day fireman bellowed . <p> The engineer leaned back and put his hand on a valve handle . " I better pump this place out . " <p> " Hey , " the pilot yelled above the bickering . " I knew this girl . Her family lived across the street from my aunt . Anyway , after all the explanations were made , the guy who surfaced at the rock concert agreed it would be best if he moved on , and the wandering twin started back where he left off with his wife . Got his job back at the iron plant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why the hell not ? " the engineer asked , dealing the next hand . " She had two for the price of one . " <p> " Yeah , well , even though those guys were identical in every way , something was different . We 'll never know what it was , but she could n't get over the second twin . Got so she would wander around herself , driving all over town looking for him . " <p> " What the hell ? " The deckhand threw down his cards . " She had her husband back , did n't she ? " <p> " Oh , it was bad , " the pilot continued . " She 's driving down the street one day and sees the rock-concert twin , gets out of her car , runs into a park yelling and sobbing , and throws her arms around him , crying , ' I found you at last , I found you at last . ' Only it was n't him . " <p> " Jeez , " the engineer said . " Triplets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head . " It was worse than that . It was her husband , who was out on delivery for the iron plant , taking a break in the park after shucking his coveralls . Mild-mannered amnesiac or not , he was pretty put out at the way she was carrying on . But he did n't show it . He pretended to be his twin and asked her why she liked him better than her husband . And she told him . Now , do n't ask me what it was . The difference was in her mind , way I heard it . But that guy disappeared again the next morning , and that was five years ago . They say you can go down in east Louisville and see her driving around today in a ratty green Torino , looking for one of those twins , this scared look in her eyes like she 'll find one and never be sure which one she got hold of . " <p> RAYNELLE pulled a pecan out of her bib pocket and cracked it between her thumb and forefinger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a room full of skeeters . You sorry sons of bitches tell the depressingest lies I ever heard . " <p> The deckhand lit up an unfiltered cigarette . " Well , sweet thing , why do n't you cheer us up with one of your own ? " <p> Raynelle looked up at a brass steam gauge bolted to an I beam . " I did know a fellow worked in an iron foundry , come to think of it . His whole family worked the same place , which is a pain in the butt if you 've ever done that , what with your uncle giving you wet willies and your cousin bumming money . This fellow drove a gray Dodge Dart , the kind with the old slant-six engine that 'll carry you to hell and back , slow . His relatives made fun of him for it , said he was cheap and wore plastic shoes and ate Spam  --  that kind of thing . " She turned the last card to show trumps , banging up a king . " Sidney , you better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty dollars . " <p> The engineer swept up his hand , pressing it against his T-shirt . " I can count . " <p> " Anyway , this boy thought he 'd show his family a thing or two and went out and proposed to the pretty girl who keyed in the invoices in the office . He bought her a diamond ring that would choke an elephant , on time . It was a nice ring . " Raynelle looked at the six men around the table as if none of them would ever buy such a ring . " He was gon na give it to her on her birthday , right before they got married in three weeks , and meantime he showed it around at the iron foundry figuring it 'd make ' em shut up , which basically it did . " <p> " They was probably speechless at how dumb he was , " the deckhand said out of the side of his mouth . <p> " But do n't you know that before he got to give it to her , that girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swimming pool and drowned . The whole foundry went into mourning , as did those kids ' families and the little town in general . She had a big funeral and she was laid out in her wedding dress in a white casket surrounded by every carnation in four counties . Everybody was crying , and the funeral parlor had this lovely music playing . I guess the boy got caught up in the feeling , because he walked over to the coffin right before they was gon na screw down the lid and he put that engagement ring on that girl 's finger . " <p> " Naw , " the engineer said breathlessly , playing a card without looking at it . <p> " Yes , he did . And he felt proud that he done it . At least for a month or two . Then he began to have eyes for a dental hygienist , and that little romance took off hot as a bottle rocket . He courted her for six months and decided to pop the question . But he started thinking about the monthly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would go on for four and a half more years , keeping him from affording a decent ring for this living girl . " <p> " Oh , no , " the pilot said , as the hand split again and the pot rolled over yet another time . <p> " That 's right . He got some tools and after midnight went down to Heavenly Oaks Mausoleum and unscrewed the marble door on her drawer , slid out the coffin , and opened it up . I do n't know how he could stand to rummage around in whatever was left in the box , but damned if he did n't get that ring and put the grave back together slick as a whistle . So the next day he give it to the hygienist and everything 's okay . A bit later they get married and are doing the lovebird bit in a trailer down by the foundry . " Raynelle cracked another pecan against the edge of the table , crushing it with the pressure of her palm in a way that made the welder and the oiler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big blue blowfly in the ointment . She was showing off that ring by the minute , and someone recognized the damned thing and told her . Well , she had a thirty-megaton double-PMS hissy fit and told him straight up that she wo n't wear no dead woman 's ring , and throws it in his face . Said the thing gave her the willies . He told her it 's that or a King Edward cigar band , because he wo n't get out from under the payments until he twenty-first century . It went back and forth like that for a month , with the neighbors up and down the road , including my aunt Tammy , calling the police to come get them to shut up . Finally the hygienist told him she 'd wear the ring . " <p> " Well , that 's a happy ending , " the deckhand said . <p> Raynelle popped half a pecan into her red mouth . " Shut up , Jack , I ai n't finished . This hygienist began to wear cowboy blouses and jean miniskirts just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old boy kind of liked it at first , but when she dyed her hair the same color as the first girl , it gave him the shakes . She said she was dreaming of that dead girl at least twice a week and saw her in her dresser mirror when she woke up . Then she began to talk like the foundry girl did , with a snappy Arkansas twang . And the dead girl was a country-music freak  --  liked the old stuff , too . Damned if in the middle of the night the guy was n't waked up by his wife singing in her sleep all eleven verses of ' El Paso , ' the Marty Robbins tune . <p> " He figured it was the ring causing all the trouble , so he got his wife drunk and while she was asleep slipped that sucker off and headed to the graveyard to put it back on that bone where he took it . Soon as he popped the lid , the cops was on him asking him what the living hell he was doing . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coffin , and they said , Sure , buddy . Man , he got charged with six or eight nasty things perverts do to dead bodies , and then the dead girl 's family filed six or eight civil suits , and believe me , there was mental anguish , pain , and suffering enough to feed the whole county . A local judge who was the dead girl 's uncle sent him up for six years , and the hygienist divorced him . Strange thing was that she kept her new hair color and way of dressing , began going to George Jones concerts , and last I heard had quit her job at the dentist and was running the computers down at the iron foundry . " <p> RAYNELLE , chere , I wish you would n't of said that one . " Simoneaux , the welder , never spoke much until late in the game . He was a thin Cajun , seldom without a Camel in the corner of his mouth and a high-crowned , polka-dotted welder 's cap turned backward on his head . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me les frissons up and down my back . " A long stick of beef jerky jutted from the pocket of his flannel shirt . He pulled it out , plucked a lint ball from the bottom , and bit off a small knob of meat . " But that diamond shit reminds me of a old boy I knew down in Grand Crapaud who was workin ' on Pancho Oil number six offshore from Point au Fer . The driller was puttin ' down the pipe hard one day and my frien ' the mud engineer was takin ' a dump on the engine-room toilet . All at once they hit them a gas pocket at five t'ousand feet and drill pipe came back up that hole like drinkin ' straws , knockin ' out the top of the rig , flyin ' up in the sky , and breakin ' apart at the joints . Well , my frien ' , he had a magazine spread out across his lap when a six-inch drill pipe hit the roof like a spear and went through-and-through the main diesel engine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knees , through the Playmate of the Month and the steel deck both , yeah . He could hear the iron comin ' down all over the rig , but he could n't run because his pants was around his ankles on the other side of the drill column between his legs . He figured he was goin ' to glory before he could get some toilet paper , but a worm run in the engine room and cut him loose with a jackknife , and then they both took off over the side and hit the water . My frien ' rolled through them breakers holdin ' on to a drum of mineral spirits , floppin ' around until a bad-ass fish gave him a bite on his giblets , and that was the only injury he had . " <p> " Ouch , man . " The deckhand crossed his legs . <p> " What ? " Raynelle looked up while posting her five-dollar bourree . <p> The welder threw in yet another ante , riffling the dollar bills in the pot as though figuring how much it weighed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company to pay him a lump sum after he got a four-by-four lawyer to sue their two-by-four insurance company . That 's for true . My frien ' , he always said he wanted a fancy car . The first t'ing he did was to drive to Lafayette and buy a **26;350;TOOLONG Mercedes , yeah . He put new mud-grip tires on that and drove it down to the Church Key Lounge , in Morgan City , where all his mud-pumpin ' buddies hung out , and it did n't take long to set off about half a dozen of them hard hats , no . " The welder shook his narrow head . " He was braggin ' bad , yeah . " <p> The engineer opened his cards on his belly and rolled his eyes . " A new Mercedes in Morgan City ? Whew . " <p> " Mais oui , you can say that again . About two , t'ree o'clock in the mornin ' my frien ' , he come out and what he saw woulda made a muskrat cry . Somebody took a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would take a dent . That t'ing looked like it got caught in a cue-ball tornado storm . Next day he brought it by the insurance people and they told him the policy did n't cover vandalism . Told him he would have to pay to get it fixed or drive it like that . <p> " But my frien ' , he had blew most all his money on the car to begin with . When he drove it , everybody looked at him like he was some kind of freak . You know , he wanted people to look at him , that 's why he bought the car , but they was lookin ' at him the wrong way , like ' You mus ' be some prime jerk to have someone mess with you car like that . ' So after a week of havin ' people run off the road turnin ' their necks to look at that new Mercedes , he got drunk , went to the store and bought about twenty cans of Bondo , tape , and cans of spray paint . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deckhand cried . <p> " No , no , " the engineer said to his cards . <p> " What ? " Raynelle asked . <p> " Yeah , the po ' bastard could n't make a snake out of Play-Doh and is gon na try and restore a fine European se-dan . He filed and sanded on that poor car for a week , and then hit it with that dollar-a-can paint . When he finished up , that Mercedes looked like it was battered for fryin ' . He drove it around Grand Crapaud , and people just pointed and doubled over . He kept it outside his trailer at night , and people would drive up and park , just to look at it . Phone calls started comin ' , the hang-up kind that said things like ' You look like your car , ' click , or ' What kind of icin ' did you use ? ' click . My frien ' finally took out his insurance policy and saw what it did cover  --  theft . <p> " So he started leavin ' the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but nobody in Grand Crapaud would steal it . He drove to Lafayette , rented a motel room , yeah , and parked it outside that bad housin ' project with keys in it " The welder threw in another hand and watched the cards fly . " Next night he left the windows down with the keys in it . " He pulled off his polka-dotted cap and ran his fingers through his dark hair . " Third night he left the motor runnin ' and the lights on with the car blockin ' the driveway of a crack house . Next mornin ' he found it twenty feet away , idled out of diesel with a dead battery . It was that ugly . " <p> " What happened next ? " The pilot trumped an ace as if he were killing a bug . <p> " My frien ' , he called me up , you know . Said he wished he had a used standard-shift Ford pickup and the money in the bank . His wife left him , his momma made him take a cab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do was drink and stay in his trailer . I did n't know what to tell him . He said he was gon na read his policy some more . " <p> " Split pot again , " the deckhand shouted . " I ca n't get out this game . I feel like my nuts is hung up in a fan belt . " <p> " Shut your trap and deal , " Raynelle said , sailing a loose wad of cards in the deckhand 's direction . " What happened to the Mercedes guy ? " <p> The welder put his cap back on and pulled up the crown . " Well , his policy said it covered all kinds of accidents , you know , so he parked it in back next to a big longleaf pine and cut that sucker down , only it was a windy day and as soon as he got through that tree with the saw , a gust come up and pushed it the other way from where he wanted it to fall . " <p> " What 'd it hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cockroach , yeah . The propane stove blew up , and by the time the Grand Crapaud fire truck come around , all they could do was break out coat hangers and mushmellas . His wife what lef ' ai n't paid the insurance on the double-wide , no , so now he got to get him a camp stove and a picnic table , so he can shack up in the Mercedes . " <p> " He lived in the car ? " <p> The welder nodded glumly . " Po ' bastard would n't do nothin ' but drink up the few bucks he had lef ' and lie in the back seat . One night last fall we had that cold snap , you remember ? It got so cold around Grand Crapaud you could hear the sugarcane stalks poppin ' out in the fields like firecrackers . They found my frien ' froze to death sittin ' up behind the steerin ' wheel .

" Nick , you little dago , give me that blue deck . " The oiler , a quiet , olive-skinned boy from New Orleans 's west bank , pushed the new box over . " New deck , new luck , " the engineer told him . " You know , I used to date this old fat gal lived in a double-wide north of Biloxi . God , that woman liked to eat . When I called it off , she asked me why , and I told her I was afraid she was going to get thirteen inches around the ankles . That must have got her attention , because she went on some kind of fat-killer diet and exercise program that about wore out the floor beams in that trailer . But she got real slim , I heard . She had a pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' the bars and soon had her a cow farmer ask her to marry him , which she did . " <p> " Is a cow farmer like a rancher ? " Raynelle asked , her tongue in her cheek like a jawbreaker . <p> " It 's what I said it was . Who the hell ever heard of a ranch in Biloxi ? Anyway , this old gal developed a fancy for steaks , since her man got meat reasonable , bein ' a cow farmer and all . She started puttin ' away the T-bones and swellin ' like a sow on steroids . After a year she blowed up to her fightin ' weight and then some . I heard she 'd eat up about half the cows on the farm before he told her he wanted a divorce . She told him she 'd sue to get half the farm , and he said go for it  --  it 'd be worth it if someone would just roll her off his half . She hooked up with this greasy little lawyer from Waveland , and sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After the court dealings he took this old gal out to supper to celebrate and one thing led to another and they wound up at her apartment for a little slap-and-tickle . I 'll be damned if they did n't fall out of bed together with her on top , and he broke three ribs and ruined a knee on a night table . After a year of treatments he sued her good and got her half of the farm . " <p> The deckhand threw his head back , ha ha . " That 's a double screwin ' if ever there was one . " <p> " Hey , it do n't stop there . The little lawyer called up the farmer and said , ' Since we gon na be neighbors , why do n't you tell me a good spot to build a house ?

" Well ? " <p> " Well what ? " The engineer scratched an armpit . <p> " What happened to that poor girl ? " <p> All the men looked around uneasily . Raynelle had permanently disabled a boilermaker on the St. Genevieve with a cornbread skillet . <p> " She got back on her diet , I heard . Down to one hundred twenty pounds again . " <p> " That 's the scary thing about women , " the day fireman volunteered , putting up three fingers to ask for his draw . " Marryin ' ' em is just like cuttin ' the steel bands on a bale of cotton . First thing you know , you 've got a roomful of woman . " <p> Raynelle glowered . " Careful I do n't pour salt on you and watch you melt . " <p> The engineer released a sigh . " Okay , Nick , you the only one ai n't told a lie yet . " <p> The young oiler ducked his head . " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Raynelle said . " A man without bullshit . Check his drawers , Simoneaux , see he ai n't Nancy instead of Nicky . " <p> Reddening , the oiler frowned at his hand . " Well , the cows remind me of somethin ' I heard while I was playin ' the poker machines over in Port Allen the other day , " he said , a long strand of black hair falling in his eyes . " There was this Mexican guy named Gonzales who worked with cows in Matamoros . " <p> " Another cow farmer , " the deckhand said with a groan . <p> " Shut up , " Raynelle said . " Was that his first name or second name ? " <p> " Well , both . " <p> " What ? " She pitched a card at him . <p> " Aw , Miss Raynelle , you know how those Mexicans are with their names . This guy 's name was Gonzales Gonzales , with a bunch of names in between . " Raynelle cocked her ear whenever she heard the oiler speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accent , which she found to be Bronxlike . " He was a pretty smart fella and got into Texas legal , worked a few years , and became a naturalized citizen , him and his wife both . " <p> " What was his wife 's name ? " the pilot asked . " Maria Maria ? " <p> " Come on , now , do you want to hear this or don'tcha ? " The oiler pushed the hair out of his eyes . " The cattle industry shrunk up where he was at , and he looked around for another place to try and settle . He started to go to Gonzales , Texas , but there ai n't no work there , so he gets out a map and spots Gonzales , Louisiana . " <p> " That rough place with all the jitterbug joints ? " <p> " Yep . Lots of blacks and roughnecks , but they ai n't no Mexicans . Must have been settled a million years ago by a family of Gonzaleses who probably speak French and eat gumbo nowadays . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who run a horse farm on the side . He gets an apartment on Gonzales Street down by the train station . " The oiler looked at a new hand , fanning the cards out slowly . " You know how hard-nosed the Airline Highway cops are through there ? Well , this Gonzales was dark , and his car was a beat-up smoker , so they pulled him one day on his way to Baton Rouge . The cop stands outside his window and says , ' Lemme see your license ' ; Gonzales says he forgot it at home on the dresser . The cop pulls out a ticket book and says , ' What 's your last name ? ' He says , ' Gonzales . ' The cop says , ' What 's your first name ? ' and he tells him . That officer leans in the window and sniffs his breath . ' Okay , Gonzales Gonzales , ' he says real nasty , ' where you live ? ' ' Gonzales , ' he says . ' Okay , boy . Get out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the door , hard . ' And who do you work for ? ' Gonzales looks him in the eye and says , ' Gonzales and Gonzales . ' The cop turns him around and slams his head against the roof and says , ' Yeah , and you probably live on Gonzales Street , huh , you slimy son of a bitch . ' ' At one-two-two-six , Apartment E , ' Gonzales says . " <p> The deckhand put his cards over his eyes . " The poor bastard . " <p> " Yeah , " the oiler said , and sighed . " He got beat up and jailed that time until the Gonzales lawyers went up and sprung him . About once a month some cop would pull him over and give him hell . When he applied for a little loan at the bank , they threw him in the street . When he tried to get a credit card , the company called the feds , who investigated him for fraud . Nobody would cash his checks , and the first year he filed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his driveway for a week . Nobody believed who he was . " <p> " That musta drove him nuts , " the welder said , drawing four cards . <p> " I do n't think so , man . He knew who he was . Gonzales Gonzales knew he was in America and you could control what you was , unlike in Mexico . So when the traffic cops beat him up , he sold his car and got a bike . When the banks would n't give him no checks , he used cash . When the tax people refused to admit he existed , he stopped payin ' taxes . Man , he worked hard and saved every penny . One day it was real hot , and he was walkin ' into Gonzales because his bike had a flat . He stopped in the Rat 's Nest Lounge to get a root beer , and they was this drunk from west Texas in there makin ' life hard for the barmaid . He come over to Gonzales and asked him would he have a drink . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a root beer . The cowboy was full of Early Times and pills , and you coulda lit a blowtorch off his eyeballs . He put his arm around Gonzales and asked him what his name was , you know . When he heard it , he got all serious , like he was bein ' made fun of or somethin ' . He asked a couple more questions and started struttin ' and cussin ' . He pulled an engraved Colt out from under a cheesy denim jacket and stuck it in Gonzales 's mouth . ' You jerkin ' me around , man , ' that cowboy told him . ' You tellin ' me you 're Gonzales Gonzales from Gonzales who lives on Gonzales Street and works for Gonzales and Gonzales ? ' That Mexican looked at the gun , and I do n't know what was goin ' through his head , but he nodded , and the cowboy pulled back the hammer . " <p> " Damn , " the welder said . <p> " I do n't want to hear this . " Raynelle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the oiler said . " Like I told you , he knew who he was . He pointed to the phone book by the register , and after a minute the bartender had it open and held it out to the cowboy . Sure enough , old Ma Bell had come through for the American way , and Gonzales was listed , with the street and all . The cowboy took the gun out Gonzales 's mouth and started cryin ' like the crazy snail he was . He told Gonzales that he was sorry and gave him the Colt . Said that his girlfriend left him and his dog died , or maybe it was the other way around . Gonzales went down the street and called the cops . In two months he got a six-thousand-dollar reward for turnin ' in the guy , who , it turns out , had killed his girlfriend and his dog , too , over in Laredo . He got five hundred for the Colt and moved to Baton Rouge , where he started a postage stamp of a used-car lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> The day fireman snapped his fingers . " G. Gonzales Buick-Olds ? " <p> " That 's it , man , " the oiler said . <p> " The smilin ' rich dude in the commercials ? " <p> " Like I said , " the oiler told the table . " He knew who he was . <p> " Mary and Joseph , everybody is in this hand , " the pilot yelled . " Spades is trumps . " <p> " Laissez les bons temps rouler , " the welder sang , laying an eight of spades on a pile of diamonds and raking in the trick . <p> " That 's your skinny ass , " Raynelle said , playing a ten of spades last , taking the second trick . <p> " Do I smell the ten millionth rollover pot ? " the engineer asked . " There must be six hundred fifty dollars in that pile . " He threw down a nine and covered the third trick . <p> " Coming gitcha . " Raynelle raised her hand high , plucked a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trick . That was two . She led the king of spades and watched the cards follow . <p> The pilot put his hands together and prayed . " Please , somebody , have the ace . " He played his card and sat up to watch as each man threw his last card in , no one able to beat the king , and then Raynelle jumped in the air liked a hooked marlin , nearly upsetting the table , screaming and waving her meaty arms through the steamy engine-room air . " I never won so much money in my life , " she cried , falling from the waist onto the pile of bills and coins and raking it beneath her . <p> " Whatcha gon na do with all that money ? " the welder asked , turning his hat around in disbelief . <p> She began stuffing the bib pocket on her overalls with half dollars . " I 'm gon na buy me a silver lame dress and one of those cheap tickets to Las Vegas , where I can do some high-class gambling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worms . " <p> Four of the men got up to relieve their bladders or get cigarettes or grab something to drink . The pilot leaned against a column of insulated pipe . " Hell , we all want to go to Las Vegas . Do n't you want to take one of us along to the holy land <p> " Man , I 'm gon na gamble with gentlemen . Ranchers , not cow farmers either . " She folded a wad of bills into a hip pocket . <p> Nick , the young oiler , laced his fingers behind his head , leaned back , and closed his eyes . He wondered what Raynelle would do in such a glitzy place as Las Vegas . He imagined her wearing a Sears gown in a casino full of tourists dressed in shorts and sneakers . She would be drinking too much and eating too much , and the gown would look like it was crammed with rising dough . She would get in a tight with a blackjack dealer after she 'd lost all her money and would be thrown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she would be back at the slot machines until she was completely broke , and then she would be on a neon-infested boulevard , her tiny silver purse hanging from her shoulder on a long spaghetti strap , one heel broken off a silver shoe . He saw her walking at last across the desert through the waves of heat , mountains in front and the angry snarl of cross-country traffic in the rear , until she sobered up and began to hitch , and was picked up by a carload of Jehovah 's Witnesses driving to a convention in Baton Rouge in an un-air-conditioned compact stuck in second gear . Every thirty miles the car would overheat and they would all get out , stand among the cactus , and pray . Raynelle would curse them , and they would pray harder for the big sunburned woman sweating in the metallic dress . The desert would spread before her as far as the end of the world , a hot and rocky place empty of mirages and dreams . She might not live to get out of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
