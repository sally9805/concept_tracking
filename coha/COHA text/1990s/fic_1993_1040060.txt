" Do n't the circumstances of the case warrant a charge of attempted murder ? Is that why you 're here investigating ? " The detective shook his head .

The detective said , " We 'll leave the legalities of the case to the DA 's office . That 's their purview . " The reporter turned toward the camera , his bland face filling Nettie Lee 's entire screen . " We 'll have live updates as the news continues to break on this story . Back to you in the newsroom , Carol . " The scene changed to a blond woman dressed in a black suit and wearing heavy neck jewelry . She sat at a desk in what Nettie Lee supposed was the newsroom . People walked about , telephones rang . The woman pressed a finger into her ear and spoke to a monitor that displayed Hayashi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brian , it 's been over five weeks since the baby was found at the construction site . How soon will the Child Protection Agency have an idea of what charges they 'd like to press ? " " That depends on a number of things , not the least of which is the District Attorney 's willingness or unwillingness to go forward with the charge of attempted murder . You 'll remember several months ago the agency tried to put together a court case to prosecute a pregnant crack addict on charges of child abuse , but that did n't pan out , mainly because of the question of whether or not a fetus is a legal entity with constitutional rights . It looks to p 51 me as if CPA is considering whether it wants to become involved in litigating a case it simply can not win . On the other hand , as with the past case , one of the purposes of going forward with this one would be to test the law  --  specifically , to test the mother 's and the baby 's protection under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights take precedence , if you will . " The blond woman said , " Thank you , Brian . " She turned back to the camera . " However it all works out , it should be interesting . " Little Barn , dressed in plaid pajamas and hugging an old T-shirt like a security blanket , walked into the living room and laid his head on Nettie Lee 's lap . She rubbed the soft hair on the back of his head . His arms circled her knees . " Grandma , I ca n't sleep . " He rubbed his face against her thighs . " The TV 's too loud . " " Hush up and go on back to bed . " Nettie Lee patted his back . " I 'm going myself in a minute . " " That 's what you said before . " His voice was draggy ; his head lolled against her thighs . " Can I sleep in your bed ? " She thought about it for a second . She wanted to say yes . Having Little Barn beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what would Yolanda say ? You 're spoiling him , Mama . He 's got to sleep by himself sometime . " No , a big man like you would take up the whole bed . A man needs a bed to himself . " " I 'm not that big , Grandma . " Little Barn stood up and gave her a bleary-eyed look . " But I am a man . " " Yeah , you a big man . Now get on back to bed . " She watched him move off into the bedroom . " Shut the door behind you . " The door closed softly . She wished she could go to sleep , but she had too many things rolling around in her mind . Yolanda and this baby . The baby almost dying on Friday . Tookie herself , sweet as a dream . Sometimes she felt like it was a dream , the way she had gotten herself into this whole thing with the hospital , being that close to other people dying , intruding on something so personal nobody ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witness it . Yeah , a witness , that 's what she was . It seemed like she could n't control  | what happened to Yolanda , Tookie , or any of those babies they let her rock , but she could be a witness . She made herself get up and go into the bedroom , find her way in the dark without waking up Little Barn . It was getting late , and Monday would be another early day in the nursery . Nettie Lee was on her third cup of coffee from the pot in the nurses ' conference room . She sat at the table for a five-minute break . Officially , she had ten minutes coming to her , but she did n't have time to take them . It seemed like things were getting worse at the hospital . When she came in at seven , she had seen Tookie all hooked up to a respirator . Foxx told her the baby was in heart failure and had had emergency surgery over the weekend . The doctors had thought she would do better if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first half of the morning helping Martha with the eight o'clocks . They managed to feed all the babies who could nipple their milk . The nurses handled the rest with gavage tubes through the nose and down to the stomach . It made feedings go fast , and surprisingly the babies stopped their restless leg pedaling and calmed down as soon as the milk hit their stomachs . Outside the partially open door , she could hear the monitor noise , the nurses calling to one another over the racket . She wondered how any of the babies slept with the lights on and people talking so loud . Maybe that 's something she 'd bring up at the report meeting  --  people should try to keep their voices down some , to make the nursery more like a home instead of a video arcade . She took a sip of coffee and sat back in her folding chair . That first day with Martha had been a trial , Martha being so bourgy and all . Nettie Lee realized she did need training , with all the babies so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martha acted like she owned those babies , like they were hers , and nobody else better lay a hand on them . She especially acted queer toward Tookie . Funny . It seemed that every time Nettie Lee tried to do something for the baby , help the doctor or just touch her , Martha got an attitude like a little brown turd and tried to stop her . At least Nettie Lee did n't have to go off on her the first day .  | That was a blessing , because Martha would not want to see Nettie Lee mad . Nettie Lee had spent the early part of the morning letting Martha tell her how to hold a baby  --  again . Every time she picked up a baby , Martha rushed over and showed her some minor adjustment to make with her hands , or maybe Martha thought she was sticking her elbow out wrong . Then there was Martha checking up on the milk cylinders , checking to see if Nettie Lee could read the number of cc 's stamped on the side of them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see just fine . You the one wears glasses . " She checked the clock over the door , got up , tossed her cup in the trash , and went back into the nursery . Martha had gone down the hall to the Child Life Advocate 's office for something . Nettie Lee was n't the least curious about what it was . She was happy to have a minute in the nursery without Martha correcting her . Outside the conference room door , the long horseshoe of Isolettes stretched across the room . Nettie Lee decided to take a walk around the nursery to check on each baby . Isolette number 1 , Riley  --  a little girl , she thought ; she 'd have to make sure later ? was rolled up to the glass viewing wall . A woman , probably the grandmother , and a little girl about six or seven stood on the other side of the glass , bending in to see the baby . Inside the nursery , Riley 's mother , a curlyheaded thirtyish woman , pushed the Isolette closer to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded enthusiastically at the little girl . " Okay ? Okay ? " The girl placed her palms on the glass , bent her head against the glare , and looked into the Isolette . She glanced up at the older woman , who looked down and smiled . Nettie Lee looked down the horseshoe : Lewis-Morley , Perez , O'Neil , Cruz , Baker , then , lying on her warming tray , Tookie . Up the other side of the horseshoe : Gonsalves , Mooney , Whiting , Brown , Grant , and Derrick in Isolette number 14 . There were only thirteen babies but , Debbie Foxx had explained , no one had the nerve to call a baby 's incubator Isolette 13 , so they just skipped that number . Nettie Lee stood by Tookie 's warming tray . She had the coffee jangles . Her stomach kept trying to burp itself into her  | throat . She swallowed . Dear Lord . Maybe if she prayed at the baby 's bedside every day , He would protect her and Yolanda . Dear Lord , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move behind her . Dr. Shapiro , an intern newly assigned to the nursery , stood beside her and was looking down on the baby . He was short and thin and wore glasses like the other doctor , but unlike Dr. Xiang he sent out what Nettie Lee called bad vibes . Maybe it was his lack of experience  --  he was just an intern  --  that caused him to act so curt and bossy . " Let 's get Baby Doe examined , then change the bandages on that incision . Where 's the other grandmother ? " The way the doctor said Baby Doe made Nettie Lee stop and think . He sounded like he thought he owned Tookie . " Can you assist me , Grandmother ? " She was n't his grandmother . " I want you to hold the baby . " The baby lay naked on her side , a plastic respirator tube drooping from her mouth . She was swathed in gauze to protect the incision where the knife had sliced through her chest to her heart . Shapiro reached under his yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instrument he put into Tookie 's ears : first the right , then the left . Nettie Lee held the baby 's skinny arms out to her sides , pinning them in place with just the weight of her index fingers . His head bent low , Shapiro finished looking in one ear ; then he held the baby 's head between his thumb and forefinger and flipped it to the other side and looked in the other ear . " We 're going to have to take this bandage off . Where 's Foxx ? " Nettie Lee saw Debbie Foxx bent over the Baker baby 's Isolette on the other side of the room . The other nurse , the redheaded one , was feeding one of the babies with a syringe . " Okay , " the doctor said , " your hands are as good as anybody else 's . Let 's get this bandage off . " " I ca n't be doing this , " Nettie Lee told him . " You can do anything I tell you to , " Shapiro said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He gestured to the sink by the nursery door . Nettie Lee squirted Betadine on her hands and rubbed it into her palms , across the backs of her hands , and up her wrists . She looked around the nursery to see if Martha had come back from  | Ms. Czajwolski 's office yet . Martha had told her not to do what the doctors asked because they did n't care if a grandmother got in trouble or not , and you could get in serious trouble for doing things that were n't in your job description . The hospital could fire you . She rinsed the red disinfectant down the drain and walked back to the warming tray . " Okay , " the doctor said , " hold her hands down . " Nettie Lee pinned Tookie down again , pressing the baby 's palms to the mattress . She felt like a bully , her victim a Tom Thumb sissy . " You 're doing a good job , Grandmother . The other woman always seems so shaky . I do n't completely trust her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bandage against the baby 's ribs and began to cut through the gauze and tape . When he pulled the bandage away , the baby 's chest lay exposed . Nettie Lee forced herself to look  --  Tookie had a two-inch incision over her heart , stitched with neat black thread , just like a trussed-up turkey . Her skin had been painted orange around the wound , probably with Betadine . Shapiro brought out his stethoscope and placed the tiny disk on the baby 's chest . Nettie Lee 's head felt full of gas . She watched Tookie 's face wrinkle and smooth as if she were trying to make sense of what they were doing to her by weaving the sensations into a dream . Later in the afternoon , Nettie Lee sighed and closed her eyes . " Girl , if I was n't so tired today I could put up with your foolishness better . I got me some problems I just do n't know what to do with . " She sat alongside Martha , rocking the babies after the four o'clock feeding . Nettie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was wrapped in three rough-feeling receiving blankets ; their small faces were the only part of them that showed . " Problems ? " Martha looked up from nudging the nipple into Gonsalves 's mouth . " What did you do while I was down the hall ? " " I did n't do anything . Why it 's always got to be me that did something ? What did you go down there for ? " " I was just checking on my application to be a foster parent . " " Oh . " Nettie Lee began to rock a little faster . " Well , I 'm talk-  | ing about something you do n't know about . I 'm talking about my own child . My daughter . " She stopped . Maybe it was okay to talk to Martha . Maybe she would understand . Martha looked away from Nettie Lee , yawning . Nettie Lee guessed she would be tired from the way she hopped around the nursery . She had seen Martha cleaning up before the four o'clocks , flinging a towel over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snap her towel , like some up-and-coming shoeshine boy . " You know how some people always got the answers ? " Nettie Lee said . " You tell them , ' Now , I do n't think you better be doing all that mess . Look like trouble to me , ' and they say , ' No , do n't be bothering me with no commonsense advice . I got to go ahead and make a fool out myself . ' So all you can do is say , ' Go ahead on , make all the mistakes you can . I wo n't say I told you so . ' " Martha nodded slightly , as if she did not know exactly what she was agreeing to . " Well , Yolanda 's just like that , hardheaded as the day is long . And I seen it coming from a long way off . " " Who 's Yolanda ? " " That 's my daughter . I told her , ' Yolanda , you got to take care of yourself now . You and Little Barn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said , ' a little family . ' I told her , ' You got to keep this family of yours little , because if you think one baby 's hard , then do n't try two . ' Two is more than two , if you know what I mean . It 's like in mathematics , what they call opponents . You know , how one number times itself equals some big number you was n't expecting , like two times two times two can equal almost a million if you keep multiplying it over ? Well , that 's what I told Yolanda  --  do n't make your family into opponents like that . I know what I 'm talking about . " " So she 's got a baby ? " Martha wrapped Gonsalves 's blanket over his feet . " How did that happen ? " " Same way it happens to everybody . But for her , I expected her to know better because I taught her good . But she ca n't take ad-vice . " Nettie Lee looked at Martha . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe she would understand Little Barn .  | One time I got home from work and here 's Barn laying up in Yolanda 's bed like he owns the whole damn house . He 's got a reefer in one hand and Yolanda 's left titty in the other . When she sees me standing in the door , she pokes out her bottom lip and crosses her arms . I say , " Yolanda , you got to be crazy because I know you ai n't stupid . I ai n't running no whorehouse . " She sticks her lip out even further and takes a drag off of the reefer . If I was n't so mad I would of laughed . Here 's these two kids doing everything they can think of to be grown , sitting up naked in that child 's bed that 's got the purple balloon sheets on it I bought her when she was six . I look over on her dresser and she 's still got the Easy Bake oven her granny gave her when she turned seven . Her floor is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought he never took off , since every time I saw him back then that 's what he 'd be wearing , and there was that fancy black cowboy hat of his that seemed like a total contradiction to everything else he was , and it 's laying right on the floor . A trail of his underwear is heading from the bedroom door to the bed , the tail end of it being one silk sock hanging off of Yolanda 's mattress . I look back at the bed , and now Barn 's puffing reefer smoke out his nose . He squints at me through the haze with his pale gray eyes , and I 'm just tongue-tied up in knots . I do n't know what to say . I do n't suppose you can believe that , can you ? I look in his face . Barn 's eyebrows are smooth , every hair going the same way , like he lines them up by size with a fine-tooth comb . His nose is straight and short . Underneath it he 's got a thin mustache curling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into an old-maid frown that says he 's looking at something he do n't like . Those nasty gray eyes look right at me . He takes another hit off of that reefer , blows smoke out , and his nostrils flutter like paper . I stand there letting the smoke go up my nose ; then I 've had it . " Yolanda , what you got this raggelly boy sitting up in your bed for ? You fifteen years old . He ai n't nothing but fourteen . "  | She scratches her head like she got to think about it . " Mama , you know Byron 's old for his age . " " This boy ai n't old enough to be in nobody 's bed , and particularly not in yours . " It 's common knowledge that a boy is two years behind a girl in the teenage years . Now , with Yolanda being fifteen and him being fourteen , that means that to her he 's really twelve , or to him she 's more like seventeen . You see what I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now Barn 's taking another Coke off of that reefer . " Mama , I am old enough to conduct my life in the manner in which I see fit , " she says . Her skinny little arms barely cover up her titties . " I can make my own decisions , thank you . " Barn pokes his elbow into her ribs , hands her the reefer . " Thank you , Byron , " she says , like she 's the Queen of Timbuktu . So what am I doing ? I feel like taking him by his nappy head and pulling him out the bed , then kicking his butt on out the back door . And slam it . But I do n't do none of that . I 'm too tired . I 'm going to do like those TV talk show people say  --  I 'm going to communicate with these children . " Barn , do your mother know where you at ? " I do n't even know why I ask him . He looks like he ai n't got no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's not what I mean . He looks like he 's missing something , and he 's looking around trying to find out where he left it . I know he ai n't finding it in my house . Barn looks up from Mr. Reefer , but he do n't talk . " Do you want me to call your mama and let her know where you at ? " " No , ma'am . We do n't have a telephone . " He takes another drag off the reefer , and I watch his little hairless chest inflate . " You want me to talk to her ? Where do you stay ? " Yolanda starts squirming in the bed . " If that 's what you think you got to do , " he says , in that stingy little voice boys use when they trying to talk , but they want to keep their reefer smoke down in their lungs too , where they think  | it 's doing them some good . " But really , Nettie Lee , " he says , " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He finally blows out and his chest goes down to normal . He looks like a kid again . Fourteen . I go over and sit on the bed , on Barn 's side . It sinks down and he almost slides into me , but he straightens himself up . He sets his back against Yolanda 's pillow , looking like a king sitting up there , Yolanda 's ruffled pillow fanning out behind him . With his left arm , skinny with a hard little muscle knotted on top , he nudges Yolanda up straight . I can see I need to try something different , make them act like they got sense . " You plan on marrying my daughter when she turns up preg-nant ? " Yolanda busts out a laugh at that , then covers her mouth and says , " Oops . " Barn looks from Yolanda to me . " I do n't think marriage is a viable institution . " " You do n't think what ? " " I think marriage is dead . " " It 's still going strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the West . " He stops talking then , like what he just said made sense . Now what is he talking about , " the West " ? We live in Ohio . Last I checked , that is the Midwest . I know that reefer is doing the talking now . And he just goes on and on like he 's Ed Bradley on 60 Minutes . " And if I decide to formally commit myself to a female , I would n't do it now . I 'm not old enough to even consider restricting my opportunities for ? " He stops blabbing and looks at Yolanda . She 's got her hand up to her forehead , wiping away sweat . I know I make that girl nervous , because I do n't put up with no b.s . She barely turns toward that little boy and she mouths , Chill . With the tip of his middle finger he smooths first one eyebrow , then the other . I feel like I ca n't breathe right , like something is itching inside  | my heart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grab that boy by his hair , put my hands into that permanent wave mess on his head , and I yank . I jerk his head down to his chest . Then I do it again . He winces and takes it , but all I can think is , It 's soft . His hair is soft and fine like a baby 's . So I let it go . I can see he 's squinting back tears . I get up off of the bed , stand over them with my hands on my hips  --  that 's my " you in deep shit " pose  --  and I look at them hard . Let them know I 'm really analyzing the situation . Barn and Yolanda sit side by side , like two of the same thing , but they do n't touch each other . Yolanda has a scared look I 've seen too many times . Barn 's face do n't look like nothing to me . I tell her , " Yolanda , I 'll be talking to you when you get your clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go on home and do n't show yourself around here no more . " I stand at the foot of the bed waiting for them to do what I say . When Barn notices I 'm not going anywhere , he says to me , " Would you leave so I can get dressed ? " Like he 's got something under that sheet I ai n't never seen before . That little punk thinks he 's a grown man . Yolanda sits on the couch next to me , plucking up a little piece of the sheet I use for a slipcover between her fingers . This couch was where I slept because I knew a teenage girl needs a bedroom to herself . Someplace she can go and plan her future or just dream . When I told her I was moving out of the bedroom so she could have it to herself , at first she said , " No , Mama . If you 're not here I 'll get lonely . " But after I put my things in the hall closet she started to like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another piece of the sheet and rubs it with her thumb . I suppose she 's waiting for me to start . " Yolanda , " I tell her , " honey , you are a fine young lady now . Almost grown . " She does n't answer me . " You have to take care of yourself , because a boy ai n't thinking about doing it for you . " She studies the piece of sheet in her hands , turns it over , and rubs the other side . " Do you hear what I 'm saying to you ? "  | " Saying the same thing you always say . " " And just what is that ? " " ' Men are no good . ' " " What ? " " Oh , Mama , I 'm sorry , but every time we talk about anything it always comes back to ' Men are no good . ' We can be talking about something as stupid as dinner , and it turns out we ca n't have what you 'd like to eat because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have the money because of Daddy , who left you because ' Men are no good . ' We talk about your friend Dorothy . I say , How is Miss Dorothy today ? and you , ' Men are no good . Her boyfriend left her in the middle of the night , got right up out of the bed , left her hugging the pillow . ' Everything we talk about has the same conclusion . I just get tired of hearing it sometimes . " " I was n't about to say that . If you could wait a minute and listen , you 'd find out what I was about to say . " Oh , my feet hurt . My bunions like to kill me , hurt worse than they ever did . I work eight hours every day at the tire plant , bending over a conveyor belt with my calipers , trying to see if the tread measures out right , and I got to come home to this mess ? I kick off my shoes , push them back under the couch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corns are hard and dry . I 'll use some lotion on them tonight , I 'm thinking ; rub the sore spots out . But for now I got this problem on my hands . " First of all , " I say , " I was talking about birth control . You got any ? " Yolanda looks back at the hank of sheet in her hands . " Mama , that 's personal . " " Not if you have a baby ! " " It would be my baby . " " Not in this house ! " " Would you please give me some credit for having common sense ? I would n't have a baby if I did n't want one . I 'm smarter than that . Byron does n't want a baby anyway . He said so . " " At fourteen I should hope not . " " Mama , I keep telling you that age does n't matter . It 's just a  | number , like on a lottery ticket . Some people act older , some people act younger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age . " She looks so sincere about what she saying , it makes my head hurt . " Do y'all think you 're in love ? " " I love him , yes . " " He love you back ? " She do n't say anything , puts her hands in her lap . She got hands like fresh-baked sugar cookies : plump tan skin , nails buffed pink . I just hate to see those hands go to waste patting Barn on the behind . Yolanda 's smart and could be a teacher if she wanted to . I just do n't know why she do n't want to . " He loves me , " she says . " He has n't said it yet , but I know he does . " " His hair that short you can read his mind ? " She gives me that exasperated look she 's so good at . " No , Mama . I do n't have to read his mind . He treats me like he loves me . He lets me talk when I need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I feel like I can take a deep breath around him . " " Girl , if you want to breathe , there 's a whole big world full of air right past that door . Go outside and knock yourself out . " Yolanda sighs , sucking up our words and pushing them out again . " I knew you would n't understand , " she says and gets up . " And do you know why ? Because you do n't know who I am . You do n't have a clue . " She slams the front door , and I can see my old yellow sheet has a dent in it where she 's been sitting . I do n't catch Barn at my house after that , but I know when he 's been there . I can smell him in the air in Yolanda 's bedroom and on her sheets and pillowcases . It 's a sharp odor that comes off his head and gets into everything , not a bad smell , just different from Yolanda 's . When she was a little girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheek down on top of her head just before I washed her hair . I 'd lay my cheek flat against her braids and smell that smell . I could get drunk off it . A smell like fresh dirt . Barn 's smell is like that too , but different somehow , not pleasing to me at all .  | That smell was around so much , I started feeling like there was a ghost in the house  --  the ghost of Barn . Seemed like if I turned around fast enough I 'd catch him disappearing around a corner , maybe going to my bathroom to pee or sliding in my kitchen to empty his ashtray . But the place his shadow grew clear was in the smirk on Yolanda 's face . I wanted to tell her , Girl , you do n't have a secret , but that smile was n't an invitation to talk . I watched her when I was home at night . She did n't go out too much , especially on school nights . By the time I got home from work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She made pretty good spaghetti sauce from the I Hate to Cook Book , so that 's what we 'd eat . When I walked in she 'd already be at the kitchen table with her schoolbooks spread out in front of her , hunched over in her chair , arms crossed , a frown pulling her face down to a point . She never asked me for help . She 'd just look up from her books and say hi . Then I 'd say , " What 'd you do after school today ? " and the ghost of Barn would slide around the corner and flush the toilet . I 'd go lay down on the couch for just a little while to rest before dinner , but ninety-nine times out of ten I 'd fall asleep . What goes around comes back . Yolanda started missing school , started staying in the bed , stopped having dinner ready when I came home . Said she must have the flu . One morning , about three months after I caught them in bed that time , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow on the ground , and I 'm running from the bathroom , pulling on my coat , trying to make my bus to work . I look in the bedroom on my way out . Yolanda 's laying up in the bed with the blankets pulled over her head . She looks small , just a little lump under the covers . I go to the window and yank her drapes open . Thin December sunlight , the kind that do n't warm nobody , comes in . Them drapes been closed so long , dust is flying all around . I lean over Yolanda , pull back the blankets , and press my hand against her forehead . Feels like touching myself . " Yolanda , you sick again ? "  | She turns over so she 's facing the wall and says , " Yeah , " like she 's half dead . " What you think is wrong with you ? I never heard of no flu lasting three months . " I 'm trying to keep the sarcasm out of my voice , but there it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a frown , boosts herself out of the bed , and runs for the bathroom , groaning . Oh , hell , my job can wait . I sit on her bed trying to figure out what I 'm going to say . When she comes back , she lays flat on the bed and stares straight up . " Go ahead and ask me , " she says , looking at that same spot on the ceiling . " Go ahead . " " How far along are you ? " She darts her eyes at me . They say this is not the question she expects . I smooth the hair back from her forehead , away from her eyes . Her face is a blotchy jigsaw puzzle ; the pieces are all there , but if I 'm not careful , they can be shook loose . Her hair feels rough under my hand , so I smooth it down and smooth it down , until she closes her eyes and says , " June . " Men are no good . And it 's too damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . They do things just to be doing them . When Sweet left me and Yolanda , I asked him over and over , " Why ? Why you going ? " His smart reply was , " Why you got to be so nosy , Nettie Lee ? I 'm going because I feel like it . That all right with you ? " I stood out on the sidewalk with Yolanda in my arms . I never even thought of answering him back . I did n't want to waste my breath . I hear Yolanda in the bedroom talking on the phone . First little whispers , then she 's screaming like she 's trying to talk to somebody lives in the next state without the benefit of a telephone . " You trifling nigger , you ! " I block it out , shut off my ears . I look out the window , out to the road . That 's where I 'd rather be . Out on that road that leads away from here .  | One night in May I come home from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take off my shoes . I reach under the couch , and instead of my house shoes what I pull out from under there is one of his black Dunhill 's loafers . The way it feels light , weightless , makes me throw it across the room , against Yolanda 's bedroom door . From inside I hear her say , " Mama ? " She is in her nightgown , sitting on her bed , resting her back against the pillows , her skinny arms crossed tight over the hump of her stomach . She likes to sit like that , says she 's hugging the baby . Barn is sitting right beside her smoking his reefer , his legs stretched out on top of the blankets , drinking a Colt 45 right out of the bottle . When the smoke curls from his nose , Yolanda fans it away with her hand . " Byron says he might move in , " she says , looking at him , coughing a little . " Yolanda , you do n't have the sense you was born with . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , " I thought you 'd be pleased . " I swear I do n't know where she 'd get a notion like that . So I ask her , " Why do I want that boy here ? I already got a child messing up my life . " " Why do you think ? " She 's getting hot now . " My baby will have a father . Byron 's here . " She looks at Barn like he is her sal-vation . " Where 's the baby 's father been up till now ? " " The baby has n't been born yet . And you do n't have to talk about Byron like he 's not here . " I look right in his gray eyes and I say , " All right , Barn , you answer the question . Where you been all these months Yolanda been pregnant ? " Barn puts his reefer in the green bubble-glass ashtray my mama gave me when she died . It 's the only thing I have left of her . He 's got it laying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . " I realize you do n't like me ? " he starts up .  | " Boy , it do n't matter if I like you or not . You do n't put food on my table . " " And I know you think I 'm too young to take care of your daughter . " " You got that right , " I say . " Little fourteen-year-old I-don't-know-what ? " " I 'm fifteen now . And I know you think I do n't know how to be a good father . " " Well , you seem to know all about what I 'm thinking . " I put my hands on my hips and stand over the bed , right on top of him . " Do you know how to be one ? Does n't look like it to me . Where you been for five months , on vacation ? In the Bahamas ? It ai n't been no Bahamas around here . " " I was taking care of my family . " He raises his hand . " Just let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you something . I do n't have a father , I never did , and my mother left us when I was twelve . Do you understand me ? Ai n't nobody raised me . I raised myself and Nathan . " " Who 's that ? " " My little brother . " " All by yourself ? " He nods his head . " How 'd you manage with no mama or daddy ? " He looks like he ai n't going to say no more . He reaches for his reefer , then changes his mind . He looks at Yolanda , who 's giving him the message with her eyes to go on , tell it . " Well , at first Mama 's sister , Cheechee , she stayed with us . She used to live with us when Mama was there . She even looked like Mama sometimes , like how she walked , the way she laughed when she talked on the phone . Sometimes after Mama left , if I was n't paying too close attention , I thought she was Mama . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on the couch with Cheechee watching TV . Have his head in the crook of her leg , laying there till way past midnight . I 'd have to half carry him to bed . He never even knew she was passed out drunk . " He smooths his eyebrows with his finger .  | Yolanda is looking at me to see if his words need embroidery , if he is getting through to me . I sit down on his side of the bed . They scootch over to make room . " What happened to Cheechee ? Where did she go ? " I want to know . He shrugs . " Wherever Mama and Daddy went . " I do n't say anything . I do n't have any answer for it . He shakes his head . " I do n't really care , either . They 're not necessary to my life . I already proved that . Cheechee stayed about two months ; then she said she had some important out-of-town business to take care of . She had on that old red knit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high heels . She told me , ' Y'all be fine , I have no doubt . ' That 's the last thing I heard from her : ' Y'all be fine . ' I had to explain that to Nathan , explain what was wrong with Mama and Cheechee . I said they 're a little mixed up . They 'll be back later . " I ca n't tell if he believes it or not , believes they 're coming back . Ca n't tell by his face . " After she left , we just stayed on in the apartment , pretending like she was there . That lasted about two weeks ; then Mr. Winn came over , hollering about the rent . Said it had n't been paid in three months and he wanted his money right then or he 'd put us out in the street and beat the money out of us . What was I supposed to do ? I got no job at twelve . And here 's this okey-dokelooking motherfucker handing me eviction papers . I almost went off on him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the dealer in my building . Everybody knows Marquis does business upstairs . So I ask him if he 'll hire me . He said yeah . All I had to do was hang around outside from nine at night to five in the morning . Somebody funny-looking come by , I tell Marquis . Or if I miss that and they get up to Marquis 's apartment , then I go around back and wait at the bedroom window . Lots of hustling and shadows on the curtains , then the window scrapes open and out flies Marquis 's duffel bag full of pharmaceuticals  --  you know , cocaine mostly . So I catch it and run . I bring it back to him later . " 1P  | " Barn , you going to get hurt doing that mess . How you go to school in the morning if you 're up all night ? " He just shrugged again , but he looked hurt . I could tell the school thing was bothering him , since he was the kind of boy who liked to sound educated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's all I cared about then . Now I 'm looking for something more ; I got my own business . Anyway , the point is I know how to take care of my family , been doing it too long not to . I can take care of Yolanda and the baby , and I can take care of you too . " And me too . Somebody wanted to take care of me too . Well , I kind of liked that idea , except he tacked me on like he was adding another raggelly ribbon to the tail of his low-flying kite . Barn and Yolanda were outside looking up into the gray sky , checking for thunderheads . They 're standing beside their cardboard grocery boxes loaded up with stuff from my house . Barn wants to take them to the new apartment now . Yolanda wants to wait , says rain will come down any minute . She has her hands on her hips , her face thrown backward while her maternity blouse blows like laundry on a clothesline . " One just hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wipes her cheek with her finger . " See that ? That is a raindrop . " Barn , like a long tree branch , bends over to look . I ca n't see her raindrop , but other drops hit the living room window and I know I 'm not going to move all this stuff now . The couch is sitting in the middle of the floor , waiting for us to carry it out the door , but I lay on it instead . That way I know it 's not going nowhere . Yolanda says Barn 's new apartment is so fine it 's got two bathrooms . She wants me to move out of this house , to stop working and stay with her and Barn , be like a mother-in-law on TV . I told her they 'd have to get married first , but then I said all right , since I owe it to her . I want to see my little girl happy just once . But I been thinking about it . I have to break my promise , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to stay in my little old raggelly house .  | From way before Yolanda can remember , this was my house . I saw the boarded-up windows and the condemned sign . I read the warnings posted on the front door . I paid the dollar it cost to take it off the city 's hands . I signed my name . I borrowed tools . I bought lumber . I stole bricks . I ripped out , tore apart , hauled away . I hammered and plastered and wired until they told me I could quit . The day the county inspector ripped the condemned papers off the door , he looked at me and Yolanda with unnatural pale eyes and said , " This is the worst thing you could have done , lady . All the houses on this block are boarded up except yours . You 'll have rats for neighbors , and that 's all ! " Yolanda buried her face between my legs . I pulled my hand out of my coat pocket and poked my middle finger at his back and told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right now ! " because he was already driving off in his truck . No , I did n't want to move from there . That house was too much like me  --  used up . If I moved away to a new apartment with big old square white rooms , where could I lay down ? Where could I be myself ? Barn and Yolanda come in with a man wearing a maroon windbreaker splotched up with rain . The man says , " Yeah , I 'm here for the couch and shit , " and stands over me . " That it ? " " Yes , " Barn says . " It makes out into a bed . " " How much you want ? " He squats down and runs his bony dark fingers across the fabric on the arms . " Looks kind of worn . Looks real worn . How much ? " Barn and Yolanda are standing there with this man , looking clown at me . Barn 's mouth twists up , ready to sell my couch . " Not a cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couch ai n't for sale . What fool said it was ? " He looks at Barn . When he turns , the water on his kinky head drips down his neck . " Look , " he says to Barn , " I ai n't here to waste time , yours or mine . This shit for sale or not ? " " My shit ai n't for sale and never has been , " I say . " Get out of my house . "  | He looks over at Barn and snorts . Before he goes out the door , he bumps into Barn and whispers , too loud , " Boy , you shoulda asked your mama first . " Barn do n't answer ; his eyes do n't flicker , his lips do n't twitch . As soon as that man is out the door , Barn and me will talk . I got things to say about how no fifteen-year-old little something can sell my furniture out from under my behind . How I do n't need a new apartment  --  I got me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't need him  --  I already had a man once . I 'm going to tell him how I 'm not moving anywhere . Ever . But Barn do n't wait around to talk . He pulls on Yolanda 's hand and they both walk out to his truck , rain hitting their heads , their shoulders . Yolanda 's blouse sticks to her back , and I see the sharp edges of her shoulder blades . They both know they could catch their death of cold , but they go on like you ca n't tell them nothing . They get in his new black pickup truck . Barn sticks his cowboy hat on his head and drives off . Once Yolanda yelled at me , " Mama , I am my worst self around you ! " And I said , " Girl , you know it do n't take no special occasion for you to act a fool . " But I 'm sorry I said it , and if I could take it back , I would . Yolanda is like a voodoo doll  --  full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them all out one by one , but would n't that hurt her too ? Maybe once you got a curse put on you , the best thing is to just go on out and do your magic . Yolanda is on her hands and knees , crawling across the labor room floor . She says she can take the pain better that way . First she crawls forward , screaming the whole way , then she crawls backward . That 's harder ; she ca n't see what 's behind her . Nurses are looking at her through the open door like they think she 's crazy . " Yolanda , " I say , " why do n't you let me help you get in the bed ? You going to wear that baby out . " She sits in a heap , legs splayed out in front , her hospital togs  | open in the back . " Oh , Mama , " she says , and I can hear all the weary in her voice , " I ca n't stand this . How long do I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clock over her bed . " Look like twenty-five seconds to me . " " Oh , shit . " She puts her head in her hands . " Why do n't you go on back to bed ? You 'll feel better if your stomach do n't hang down so far . " " No , I feel better this way , when the baby hangs out , like it 's just part of me , not all of me . How many seconds ? " " Five , " I say , " four , three ... " Oh , Mama , do n't be funny . I do n't have time to laugh right now . " She gets back up on her hands and knees . The nurses come in and out . They pick Yolanda up off of the floor , get her back in the bed . They strap a monitor around her stomach . Later , they take her to the delivery room . They know I 'm the labor coach , so they let me come too . And where is Barn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the delivery table , my hands under her knees , spreading her thighs apart so the baby can come out . She 's got her hands on top of mine , gripping me like she ai n't got nobody else . I tell her to pant , wait for the contraction to get good and strong , then take a deep breath and push . I pant with her until I get lightheaded . We 're together like that , me trying to help deliver this baby , her trying to push it out . I 'm thinking things are so different in the hospital now . I was asleep when Yolanda was born . I did n't know anything about panting , helping the baby come out in its own time , having to be patient with the birth . I guess I 'm just surprised I did n't mess it all up myself . Then here comes the baby 's head . I see it shiny wet , coming out between Yolanda 's legs . She cries , says , " Help me , Mama . Help me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Take a deep breath and push hard . Push real hard . " The baby slides out in one wet plop . When they lay him on her stomach , Yolanda says , " Oh ! " They clamp him off and hand me the scissors , saying , Cut between these two clamps . I open up the scissors and get the cord in there , then cut  | through like I 'm cutting raw steak . I remember something I heard on TV once . I think it was Michael asking Archie on All in the Family : If two people you love are drowning and you can only save one , who would you save ? Well , my answer is : I just do n't know . Martha shook her head . " I think you have to save yourself . " " But I love my child like I love myself . More . " " And you think that 's a good thing ? " Martha looked down at Gonsalves , pulled his blanket in closer to his face . " If you love your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her , then you 'll die . You wo n't have any reason to live because everything you thought was yours will be gone . It 's like when you plan the future with him at the center of it . You see yourself doing everything . In every single picture you have of yourself in the future , your child is there too . Then , if something happens to him , you have to go through and rip out the part of the picture where he was . And that 's not possible . So you have to think of yourself as a separate person , always . " Riley jerked in Nettie Lee 's arms . " Who are you talking about , exactly ? That do n't sound like me and Yolanda . " She rocked slower to keep the baby asleep . Sometimes Martha did n't make sense , though Nettie Lee could see she was trying hard to tell her some-thing . " All I 'm saying is , how can you help somebody else when you 're drowning yourself ? I think if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  then if you have any hope of saving the other person , you have to know you are strong enough to save not just yourself but that other person too . You have to have the strength of two people . " Although Nettie Lee was n't sure what Martha was talking about , she did think maybe Martha was right . Maybe nobody had to drown if she was strong enough to keep all their heads out of the ocean : hers , Yolanda 's , Little Barn 's , Tookie 's . If she could be Hercules , things might be all right .  | In the scrub room , Martha quietly listened to two student nurses who stood by the sink , talking . Their yellow gowns were cinched tight at their waists , and below the long hems the girls wore white sweat socks and high-top sneakers . They looked like new pledges to a convent . In one continuous movement , they lifted their arms behind their heads , twisted their hair into knots , and tucked it into blue paper bonnets . The gesture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Martha pretended to busy herself putting on her scrub gown as they spoke . " I totally blew him off , " one said , fingering the last bit of blond hair into the front of her bonnet . " He pretends like his wife does n't work on the second floor . " The other one , less pretty now without her frame of hair , looked at her friend and shrugged . " Yeah , he 's married , Kristy , but he 's still a doctor and he 's cute . So what 's it going to hurt ? " They leaned in to the sink , taking turns washing their hands in disinfectant . " You 're probably right , " the first one said . " I guess I 'm just old-fashioned when it comes to men . I 'd rather go out with somebody who can stay the night . " She looked up at Martha , then  | blushed . " We better hurry up and get to labor and delivery , " she said to her friend . " We 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Martha felt a small turning in her stomach , an acid displeasure . Since she did n't want to be the last one in the scrub room , she wiped her hands and quickly left before the students did . She stood looking through the small window in one of the nursery doors . Beyond it , the nursery played like a television soap opera with the mute button on : Debbie Foxx skirting Dr. Shapiro , an X-ray tech ponderously hauling his equipment from one Isolette to the next , the electronic monitors silently drawing their fluorescent green graphs of the babies ' heartbeats  --  all of it muffled . She paused to collect herself . Was this really what she wanted to do , to rock these babies , fragile , dangerous as ticking bombs ? With dismay she felt her own beating heart . Worried it could be heard by the doctors , the nurses , she imagined her chest stuffed with cotton swabbing to deaden its strikes . She stepped on the door pad , flinging the double doors open , and there was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chatter , and an occasional yell . " Martha ! " Debbie Foxx waved impatiently from across the room . Martha felt queasy , wished she had at least eaten a piece of toast before leaving home . Now it looked as if the nursery would be too busy for her to eat breakfast during break . She walked to where Foxx leaned against the worktable , writing in one of the charts . Foxx straightened up and put her hand on Martha 's elbow . " Come on . We 're late for Report , but we can say we got hung up talking about a case with the mom and dad . " She laughed a little . " That 's partly true , since I did . Where 've you been ? " She gave Martha a long look , her eyebrows raised . With a sigh , Martha remembered it was Tuesday . On Tuesdays and Thursdays the nurses ' Report began half an hour early . Afterward the social worker from the Child Protection Agency reported her progress on the cases she was assigned . Three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . Two  | were born exposed to drugs , the third was Martha 's Faith : drug exposed , then disposed of in a toilet . She hoped the woman from CPA would place the baby with her . She loved holding the babies , these tiny ones especially , and she took care of all the babies every day ; did n't that prove she was good enough ? Maybe they would let her take Faith home . She took her place at the conference table next to an empty chair . Nettie Lee , wearing deep-brown lipstick , her down-turned mouth accentuated , gave Martha a sour look , then turned away . She looked like a disgruntled Happy Meal clown . Foxx sat in the empty chair beside Martha . The other staff members circled the table . Martha 's chair was on the table 's curve , her feet unable to find a spot to rest flat . After hitting her shins against the table legs , she folded her feet under her chair . She thought again of Faith , lying several feet away beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible for girls who had all these services available to them  --  welfare , Medicare , drug abuse clinics , counseling of all sorts  --  how was it they could still make such a mess out of their lives , do something as trashy as throwing away a baby in a toilet ? She shook her head . With the government playing husband to these girls , what did they lack ? They got money for a place to live , and they got food stamps to feed themselves and their kids . She looked around the table at the hospital staff : Dr. Xiang and the intern , Shapiro ; four nurses ; a social worker ; the director of Respiratory Therapy ; the Child Life Advocate ; and two grandmothers . Here sat all the help anybody could ask for . Any problem could be solved . But some of these girls were on their second and third baby . Why did they keep messing up ? Some of the babies did n't even have anybody to go home to , would have to be released into foster care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to be helped . The new social worker leaned forward in her chair . Dressed in a cream-colored jacket with matching miniskirt , cream stockings , and flat-heeled shoes , she had a hopeful smile that Martha chalked up to youth and good intentions . A triangle of pink lace showed on her chest beneath her buttoned jacket . Lace underwear  | instead of a blouse ? Martha checked the buttons on her own oxford shirt , drew her sweater tighter across her chest . " I 'm Barb Hunter , the new Child Protection Specialist for the nursery unit . " Hunter looked full circle around the table , then laced her fingers together . " The former specialist for Mercy Ped , Lorna Patterson , got married , and now she 's on maternity leave . So I 'm the one you 'll contact if a baby has been drug exposed or if any other type of abuse or neglect is suspected . " She paused . Martha thought her voice sounded little-girlish and jumpy . " You can get in touch with me the same way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm catching up on the casework that 's been turned over to me , but I 'll be able to give you a report on what I 'm planning for the families by next week . And that includes a request I have from one of your volunteer grandmothers to be a foster par-ent . " She looked at Nettie Lee . " Are you Martha Howard ? " Nettie Lee turned down her mouth further . " No , I am , " Martha said , feeling a quickening in her chest . " I put in the application . " " Have you made a decision ? " Terese Czajwolski asked . Martha felt hopeful about being approved . Ms. Czajwolski said they would come out to her house before the final determination , but unless Martha had some sort of serious problems , like a criminal record , things should go smoothly . " Well , " Miss Hunter said , " I will tell you that normally we try to find a couple for placement . You 're an older woman and you are n't married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " She sat back and nervously touched her fingers to her mouth . Martha felt embarrassed and shamed . She angrily thought Miss Hunter was too young to decide on what was best for the babies . Foxx said , " Well , that 's fine , Barb . Welcome to the nursery , by the way . Okay , I have just one thing to add before we all head back into the chaos . " There were groans and a small amount of laughter . " I 've , uh , got a change in personnel plans . " She looked at Martha , then at Nettie Lee . " Nettie Lee Johnson has com-  | pleted her training , and since she 's done such a good job with the babies , the nurses agreed that she and Martha should share the position of Head Grandmother . " She smiled at Nettie Lee and Martha , then sat down . Nettie Lee smiled at Martha as if she could now afford the ex-pense . " May I ask a question ? " Martha said it before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two Head Grandmothers ? That 's like a two-headed monster . " Nettie Lee frowned . " That sure is a funny way to put it . " " Martha , " Foxx said , " there 's no reason to feel upset ? " " I do n't feel upset . " " ? because what I see is you and Nettie Lee working together as equals , like the nurses do in the unit . You divide up the work equally anyway , do n't you ? " Foxx asked cheerfully . Martha said , " Does n't the unit have a head nurse anymore ? " A few seconds passed before Foxx spoke . Martha 's mind raced forward to what she herself would say next in her own defense . " Well , yes , of course the nursery has a head nurse , but what we do is so complicated and we 've got so many patients and personnel providing care that we need someone in charge . " She looked around the room as if searching for someone to hand her head nurse position to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work you do , both of you , is wonderful . I just thought  --  we all did  --  that since you two are the grandmothers who answered the ad and agreed to the workload , you could be equal partners . And besides , I noticed that sometimes you have a little difficulty finishing up the tasks I assign . I 'm sure it 's because there 's so much work to be done . but if you and Nettie Lee kind of checked up on each other , you could both make sure that no baby assigned to a grandmother misses a feeding or a diaper change . It 's just a way to make sure things get done and make it easier on you . I hope it 's not going to be a problem . " She picked up her clipboard . Martha felt a pang in her chest . Had she forgotten to feed a baby ? What had she done wrong ? " No . It 's not a problem . "  | In the early afternoon , the sun slanted palely through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's warming tray , watching the windows become blank with reflected light . She had completed the housekeeping chores she had assigned herself : straightening the babies ' blankets and cleaning the Isolettes by rubbing an alcohol wipe over each one , polishing off the fingerprints and spilled oily medicines . Now came the time she wanted to enjoy  --  holding her babies , one by one , and lulling them into a dream of the womb they had left behind . Before Nettie Lee came , Martha had tried to rock every baby every day . That did n't work . With only ten or even eight babies in the horseshoe , Martha could n't rock them all . Some could n't be picked up , like Faith now ; she had to stay on her warming tray , lying flat or sometimes lying on her side but never held ; her condition was too critical . Foxx said they had cut open her chest for heart surgery on Saturday morning . Even if Martha had the nerve to pick her up , there was also the problem of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down her throat the respirator was connected to . Was it all right to just let them droop or would that hurt the baby ? Beside Faith 's tray stood a Baby Bird respirator , an IV monitor slung from a pole , a heart monitor mounted on the partition behind her tray , and a set of bilirubin lights , brilliantly fluorescent , poised just a foot over the baby . Faith lay on her back , her eyes bandaged against the light . For her , Martha just stroked her arm or lifted her leg , then gently put it down on the mattress . Before Nettie Lee came , she could n't spend too much time on Faith or any of the other babies . They got ten minutes for a morning rock and that was all . She could barely get that done , even with so small an amount of time for each child . The babies deserved more attention than that . Maybe it was good to have Nettie Lee there , an extra pair of hands , another set of eyes , more rocking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her babies had gotten used to her , looked forward to being held in her arms and rocked , not somebody else 's . Babies were funny that way . They  | preferred the person they got used to . Now they had to let a stranger hold them . They would n't like that . She traced her finger along Faith 's thigh , ruffling the sparse lanugo hair . In the supply room , Debbie Foxx was unloading linens off the laundry cart and storing them . Martha could see her through the half-open door . Bracing a pile of folded laundry against her chest , Foxx walked to where Martha stood beside Faith 's warming tray . They both watched the baby sleep , her bony chest rising , taking in measured drafts of respirator oxygen . " She 's a cute baby , " Foxx said , resting her chin on the towels . " Sometimes before I go home , I go over to maternity and look in the nursery . I ca n't help it , but I stand there looking at all those rows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular babies are such big gazoos . You know ? " She rested her finger on Faith 's shoulder . " When my husband and I decide it 's time to have one , I 'm going to be so used to these little guys I wo n't know what to do with a full-term baby . " " I think you figure out what God gives you pretty quick , " Martha said . " No matter what you end up with , you ca n't imagine your children being any other way but the way they are . " " Yeah . " Foxx lifted her head from the towels . " How many grandchildren do you have ? " " None . " Martha turned from the warming tray . " I 'm going to start the afternoon schedule by feeding Riley . All right ? " " All right , " Foxx replied quickly . " Would you change her first ? I 've got to put this stuff on the supply cart . Then save the diaper for me so 1 can record her output . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latch on Riley 's Isolette and slid her arm through the port . On the inside corner , Riley 's mother had taped a green and red plastic Christmas tree ball . Martha bounced it with the tip of her fingers . Occasionally a mother brought something from home , a little stuffed toy or a tiny pillow stitched in bright thread and dotted with her perfume , just to let the baby smell her when she was n't there , for comfort . Riley 's mother was obviously in the Christmas spirit , Martha thought . With Christ-  | mas only two days away , she sadly realized her holiday would pass unacknowledged : no tree , no Christmas dinner . What would be the point ? She unclipped the wires from sticky patches on the baby 's chest and sides , untangling red , blue , and yellow strands . She removed Riley 's diaper , put on a fresh one , folding it down twice to expose the black scab over her navel . It took longer than she wanted , her stiff fingers stumbling over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It did n't want to stay beneath the baby 's navel . She looked up briefly , saw Foxx moving around in the supply room , occupied with stocking the linen carts . " I 'm leaving the diaper on the scale for you , Nurse Foxx , " she called . Foxx 's voice drifted out from the supply room . " Fine . I 'll weigh the evidence before it evaporates . " The double nursery doors bumped open and Nettie Lee walked through . She strolled around the horseshoe , looking into each Isolette , lingered at Baby Doe 's tray , then stood beside Martha . The warmth from Nettie Lee 's body seemed to rise in waves . Martha already felt hot : the nursery lights were too bright , the Isolettes emitted their own heat , and , with all that , the yellow gown over her pants , shirt , and sweater was too much . She wiped perspiration from her forehead , saying to Nettie Lee as politely as she could , " Would you go ahead and get the bottles ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her , making no movement toward the conference room where the feeding supplies were stored . " I 'm doing Riley , and then Cruz after that . You can get Whiting and Mooney . " It occurred to her she should consult Nettie Lee on this arrangement instead of simply announcing which babies she 'd rock and which ones belonged to Nettie Lee for the afternoon , but she could n't force her mouth to say , Sound all right to you ? She did n't really feel like discussing it . Sliding her hands into Riley 's Isolette ports , she balled the paper diaper into a small package , secured it with the sticky tabs , and placed it on top of the Isolette . Hands back inside , she began straightening up the lamb's-wool mattress and waterproof padding . " I'ma rock that little one over there . " Nettie Lee pointed to  | Gonsalves . Her hands were puffy-looking , chapped , the nails bitten off . She was wearing a wedding ring , but it was on the wrong hand . " I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think little Baker is getting ready to wake up and start fussing . He over there squirming in his sleep right now , like he got worms or something . You need to go pick him up . " She looked at Martha expectantly , as if waiting for her to close Riley 's incubator port and carry out her instructions . Nettie Lee 's face looked tired , puffy like her hands . Her mouth , naked of the lipstick she had worn during Report , added to her washed-out look . " I 've already decided which babies I can take care of today . Riley for now , then Cruz when it 's time for the four o'clock feed-ing , " Martha told her . " You 're not going to have Baker to feed . By four o'clock , his mama 'll be in here , " Nettie Lee said . Then she added , " Her husband gets off his job then , and they come straight here . They like to see the baby before they go home to eat their dinner . And see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visitors , a thin long-haired girl and a shorter fat  --  no , pregnant  --  girl talking to Debbie Foxx near the supply room . " That 's Cruz 's mama , the tall one . She can feed him . " Martha had forgotten about Mrs. Baker . And she had never seen Cruz 's mother . Now her slip made her look forgetful , maybe even incompetent . Would Nettie Lee tell anyone she could n't handle the schedule ? She would worry about that later . A silence was born between them . Martha turned back toward Riley 's Isolette , slid her hands out of the ports , and opened the lid . Riley lay on her back , her eyes squeezed shut , her forehead wrinkled with the effort to close out the light . Martha knew she was n't asleep . She wriggled one hand beneath Riley 's back , then scooped up her sprawling weight . With her other hand , she steadied the small head , lifted the baby up . The baby felt awkward in her hands , her tiny legs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off balance . Martha had the dizzying sensation of dropping her . She braced her hands around the baby 's body , stiffening her elbows yet cradling her gently but firmly , the way she  | would a camera , trying not to shake . At the same time , she moved the baby toward the blanket she 'd thrown over her shoulder , then neatly stepped around Nettie Lee . " I see my opinion do n't count for too much . " Nettie Lee turned to follow Martha 's progress to her rocker . " You know I 'm in the same position as you now . " She raised her voice . " We got two head grandmothers in this nursery . " Martha turned quickly , said in a low voice , " I did n't say a word . " She laid the baby against her shoulder , sat in the rocker . " And , as far as two grandmothers in the nursery goes , anything Nurse Foxx decides to do for these babies is all right with me . " She covered Riley with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , then laying her on her lap to tightly crisscross the blanket flaps in front . " I do n't pretend to know more about what 's good for the patients than the nurses do themselves . " Finished with the swaddling , she laid Riley over her shoulder and began to rock quickly , letting the motion of the rocker quiet them both . Nettie Lee disappeared into the conference room , returning several minutes later with a cylinder of milk . " I told Debbie I'ma feed Gonsalves , and she said go on ahead . " She took her time at Gonsalves 's Isolette , unclipping and wrapping him . After she sat down with him and he began to suck his bottle , Nettie Lee stopped rocking and looked at Martha . " Did I ever tell you the story about why the dog hates the cat ? " Martha felt her mouth tighten . " I did n't , did I ? Well , I meant to . See , the dog and the cat loved to dress up and go out together every Friday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear the same kind of clothes . " The dog was partial to silk and lace boudoir outfits and she wanted to borrow the cat 's fine red chemise . " The cat says , All right , Sister Dog . You can have the outfit for Friday night , but I want it back for the party I'ma go to on Saturday . ' " The dog says , Trust me , Sister Cat . I wo n't get nothing on the dress . '  | " On Friday night they 're at the club and Sister Dog is doing what dogs do best : rumbling through the garbage cans looking for leftovers , chasing Brother Skunk through the fence , tussling around the alley with that fine-looking Brother Dog . Pretty soon , the red chemise ai n't red no more . " The next day , Sister Dog comes trailing up the walk with Sister Cat 's tattered dress . Excuse what happened to your clothes , Sister Cat . I was careful as I could be . But you know I ca n't help myself , seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocking . " And just what is that supposed to mean ? " She got up unsteadily , carrying Riley into the conference room . Another cylinder of soy sat warming in a small basin of water in the sink . She picked it up and shook it in her hand , the milk foaming up . She had hoped her days were n't going to be like this , with Nettie Lee taking over the work , getting her own way with the nurses , dominating her , and doing a good job of it too . She felt helpless , faced with the total confidence others naturally assumed when in her presence . When they got around her , people could not seem to mind their own business . They immediately became experts on whatever it was she was doing , from holding these babies to telling her she was selfish . If she was selfish , whose business was it anyway ? Certainly not this woman 's . And at fifty , she was too old to be told what to do . She walked Riley back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mouth . " It do n't mean a thing , " Nettie Lee said placidly , as if Martha had never left . " Except what you get out of it . " Nettie Lee looked up at her . She felt a queer nervousness edge her anger . " I do n't need you telling me my business . " Why did everything she say sound like a kid 's retort ? " Well , who said you did ? " Nettie Lee patted Gonsalves 's bottom . " My idea about stories is this : You hear one , you take what you can from it . Now some people you ca n't talk sense into . Tell them one thing , they hear another . Other people are always thinking you talking about them . No matter what you really saying , to them you talking about their personal business . Now  | those kind of people make me tired . I ca n't be worrying about somebody 's hurt feelings all the time . I got to say what 's on my mind and then let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is their own business . " Martha hissed air through her teeth . " In my family , people try to mind their own business . Not stick their nose where it does n't belong . I suppose you never learned how to do that . " " I suppose I did n't . " Martha and Nettie Lee rocked silently , their chairs facing each other but in no danger of touching . Nettie Lee was close enough to talk to without Martha having to raise her voice . The rhythmic push of their rockers kept back the racket of the intensive care unit . It seemed if they rocked hard enough they could create a quiet space around them that would expand like a balloon they were blowing up . They rocked like that , getting up every half hour or so to change babies ; then both would sit down again with a new one and begin rocking and feeding all over again . After their argument , Martha thought she 'd welcome the silence , but surprisingly she did not . The two student nurses Martha had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little after five . They came immediately to where Martha , LaRone Cruz , and her friend Shavonne , in her last month of pregnancy , stood talking . " Oh , look at this little guy , " one student said , bending over Cruz 's Isolette . " Is n't he cute ? " She turned to Martha . " Can I hold him ? " " You better not wake my baby up . " LaRone stood sullenmouthed beside her son . " Oh , is this your baby ? My name is Kristy Williams , I 'm in nurse 's training . I just want to rock him for a little while . That 's one of the things we do on the neonatal rotation . " " I just put him to sleep . He do n't need rocking . " The student looked at her friend . " Well , okay . Maybe I 'll get to rock him tomorrow . " She shrugged .  | Martha felt the girl 's disappointment . " Derrick and Grant are done eating . You can rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far end of the horseshoe . The students walked over with a slightly knock-kneed shuffle . " They 're pretty girls , " she told LaRone and her friend . " I like to see girls training to be nurses . It 's a good occupation , like teaching . And it pays well enough until they find a doctor to marry . I know they 're looking . I heard them talking about it . " She was sure they never meant to get involved with married men . The doctors were n't being honest with them , that 's all . Some men were like that with young girls , always leading them on . Shavonne snorted . " I do n't believe I 'm hearing this shit . Why you got to be looking all up in white girls ' faces ? If you want to talk about somebody being pretty , look at LaRone . She 's beautiful . I mean , I for one do n't need no picture of some pasty-face blond to show me what I need to look like , know what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LaRone was pretty , but too skinny . She looked Polynesian , dark-haired , dark-eyed , but Martha did n't like her style of dress  --  a stretchy black minidress that showed her long legs to be hinged on the boniest knees Martha had ever seen . And her head looked too large for her body . She looked as if she did n't eat . She thought LaRone was n't married , and decided that was the reason why . No man wanted a skinny woman . " Well , I do n't apologize for my views . I do n't think there 's anything wrong with saying what everybody knows is true . If you were impressed with your own nappy head , you would n't take offense when I compliment somebody else . " " Oh , Lord . Who rang your doorbell ? " Shavonne rolled her eyes at LaRone . " My generation grew up during a time when we tried to fit in , my whole family did . I 'm not one of your politically correct black nationalists , but I do n't need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know which end is up . " " Excuse me ? "  | " What y'all talking about over here ? " Nettie Lee held the schedule clipboard . She looked at Shavonne . " What you got your eyes rolled up for ? " " I do n't believe some of this shit I 'm hearing . " Nettie Lee swung to Martha . " What ? " Somehow , she had gotten herself into trouble . LaRone looked at Martha . She opened the top of her baby 's Isolette . " I 'm going to rock him some more , okay ? " " Sure , dear . Go ahead . " She watched LaRone try to work the monitor clips with her long red nails . " Here , let me help . " She wanted to keep her hands occupied , busy her mind . " It 's okay , " LaRone said . " I got it . " She let LaRone take the blue clip out of her hand . She felt heartened to see another mother , besides Mrs. Baker , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . You go ahead , you 're doing fine . " Her anger was lessening ; she felt more in control . She was , after all , more experienced than Nettie Lee or any of the mothers in the nursery . Only the nurses surpassed her ca-pability . " Get the rockers out , " Martha announced . " It 's time to rock these babies . " She tapped Shavonne on the arm . " Come on and help me  --  being pregnant is n't a handicap . " Shavonne disappeared into the supply room , returning with a small wooden rocker , which she scooted along the floor . Martha found the rocker she 'd used that morning for Riley pulled up next to Brown 's Isolette . She held it out in front of her and duckfooted to where LaRone was settling down with her baby . She unhooked Whiting from his monitor leads and sat down with him . " I need me a new baby this evening . " Nettie Lee scanned the horseshoe . " Who have I been neglecting ? " Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . " Who needs a special rock from their designated grandma ? " She turned to Martha . " Who you got ? " Martha looked at the baby in her lap . " Whiting . " He was flatfaced , puffy-eyed , only eight days old and weighing three and a half pounds . His face had the smooth look of a half-empty leather  | pocketbook . He grimaced , breathing out in gentle pants . " And you 've got your little baby , " she said to LaRone . " What 's his name ? " " Daquille , " LaRone said . " So Daquille is getting his rock . " She looked at the student nurses . " And those two got Derrick and Grant . " " Well , I guess I'ma take Mooney , " Nettie Lee said . " I never rocked her before . " Shavonne got out of her chair . " I can rock a baby . " Martha waved her back into the chair . " I know you can , dear , but you either have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why ? Grandmothers ai n't the only ones who know how to rock . There really ai n't that much to it . " Martha grew impatient . " You 're not insured by the hospital to rock somebody else 's baby unless you 're in the program . " " What are you getting so stressed for ? I guess I could sign their papers . I 'm not doing anything all day . If I get to be a volunteer , I could help y'all out when I come here with LaRone . " " You ca n't do that . " " Why not ? " " You 're not old enough to be a grandmother . " " I got to be a grandmother to be a grandmother ? " " You have to be fifty to be a grandmother . " " Shoot , I ai n't nowhere near fifty . " She laughed . " And glad of it . " " Well , when you get to be fifty you can be a grandmother . " " LaRone going to be a grandmother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " No , think about it , girl . Okay , here you are twenty , and you got Daquille . Then he gets some girl pregnant when he 's sixteen ? " " Shut up . " " You be thirty-six , got some little kid calling you Granny . " " How old will you be when your grandchild is born ? " Martha looked at Shavonne . " I do n't know . "  | " You younger than me , Shavonne . " " Shoot . " They rocked in silence for a while , Shavonne apparently satisfied to be quiet . Martha began to feel restless ; the silence weighed on her . She found it surprising to want to hear her companions talk . Across the horseshoe , the student nurses laughed a little at something one of them said ; then they stopped rocking while one girl pointed to the baby in her arms , and the other girl leaned from her rocker to look . Martha watched them , then turned back to her circle . She drew Whiting against her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling welled behind her eyes . This story poured out . When I came home from my sixth-grade health class with comic books from the Kotex company on menstruation , my mama did n't say anything . There was that hesitation she had , that compression of her lips , then the turning away . I curled up on the couch looking at my pictures of yellow-haired girls with pink eggs in their uteruses and question marks over their heads to show they were wondering about menstruation , what it was going to do to them . I turned the page to see the cartoon girl 's mother , hand resting on her daughter 's shoulder , smiling and holding a box of sanitary pads . While Mama swept the living room carpet with a broom , her strokes especially hard in front of the couch where I lay , I wished passionately for my monthly to come , for the blood to start ; then I could use the clean sanitary pads like the girl in the book . The next day , even though my monthly had n't started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plain blue box of Kotex with my allowance . The clerk , a middle-aged man who stopped his conversation with an older woman standing at the counter , could n't understand me when I whispered that I wanted Kotex . " What ? " he kept saying . " You want a box of what ? " until the woman flatly told him , " She wants a box of Kotex , John . " Rather than being embarrassed because I 'd asked for it , I was em-  | harrassed for not having said it loud enough . Kotex , I should have yelled . I want Kotex ! I saved the box in my dresser drawer for months , waiting for my monthly to start . When it finally did , I did n't recognize it . I was walking home for lunch on one of those overly bright February days when the sun made the snow on the ground glittery and sharp in my eyes . I felt heavy in my crotch and wet between my legs . Squinting , I opened the door to my house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see at all . I was snow-blind . I felt my way from the front door , down the hall to the bathroom . In the dark , I pulled up my dress . On my panties I could see the floaters in front of my eyes and big dark-green spots . My heart caught . It looked like blood , but I could n't be sure what I was seeing . It was hard to wait to get my eyesight back , to stop being snow-blind , to find out if I had finally started my monthly . Meanwhile , I got bad cramps and threw up . Just that quick . I called Mama at her work to tell her . A man answered the phone and said she was in the rest room . I thought it was odd we were doing the same thing at the same time , only she was in Springfield at the air force base , and I was at home . When she got home at five-thirty , Mama did n't ask me about it , but she swatted my butt with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a good woman deep in her heart , and told me when I was little that she loved me more than tongue can tell , I knew my teenage concerns were petty in her eyes . She loved babies , not teenagers . She simply did n't have eyes for me any-more . When my brother , Michael , was in the tenth grade , and I was in the sixth , he told me that nobody was thinking about a silly little colored girl like me . I was n't a threat to anybody , not important enough to worry about . But wait until I got to high school , he said . People would look at me differently . Since sixth grade I 'd had two friends , Kathy and Karen , who spent most of their time lying across my bed reading fashion magazines and , when my mother was at work , smoking ciga-  | rettes . Karen liked Winstons because the high school boy she was after had the same name . I did n't like him too much , though . He called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face sometimes , though she liked it . She said it was as close to sex as you could get . I 'd never been inside Karen 's house . I 'd only stood below her bedroom window while she climbed out to meet me . Her mother did n't like to have strangers in the house , including Karen 's friends , but sometimes she got away with sneaking Winston in through her bedroom window . In back of the house they had a screened-in porch I admired just because it looked like it might be cool to sit there in the summertime . Karen would meet me beneath her window dressed in tan shorts and a sleeveless white blouse . I 'd wear black shorts and a black short-sleeved blouse , hot as hades ; then we 'd walk to the corner store to buy a pack of Winstons for her and a Sugar Daddy for me . I had such a sweet tooth Mama was forever telling me I was about to catch diabetes . The summer between eighth and ninth Karen would n't come out of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had to clean out the fireplace or something . Kathy started doing the same thing too . All that summer I lay on my bed and listened to the radio at night , a wobbly fan blowing hot air from the floor , too hot to sleep . I did n't really see them again , except to pass them in the hall in high school . I decided to forget my eighth-grade friends and to make my own high school life . Custom-make it to suit me , made to fit . When high school started in the fall , I met a girl in algebra class named Angelbertha . She and I were the only black girls at Fairlawn High . Four other black people went to the high school , but I did n't know them . Two were juniors on the basketball team , one was a senior on the football team , and one was running for student council president . Angelbertha was in the drama club . Because she was so fat she mostly got to play middle-aged mothers , or the great-aunt who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the table and eat ; once , to her embarrassment , she played a mammy to a Civil War family in the South .  | She said it was okay because she pretended she was Hattie McDaniel in Gone With the Wind , a real actress , though no one knew it . When I told her I was planning to try out for Fairlawn 1 ligh 's drill team , she said , " I hope you 're not disappointed when you do n't make it . " We were walking home from school together . We both lived about two miles away . " Why do you think I wo n't make it ? " The closer we got to home , the smaller the houses got . Angelbertha lived another half mile from me . " Well , you 're too mousy . " She was quietly panting . " You 've got to speak up for yourself and let people know what you want . " I did n't say anything for a moment , just listened to the rustle of Angelbertha 's stockings beneath her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said . " I want to be on the drill team , so I 'm trying out . " I was thinking that it never failed , people always thought I was too quiet , even though I tried to seem loud and funny . " Do n't get insulted . I did n't mean anything . I 'm just saying you have to know what you want out of life to get it . " It really surprised me back then when people saw me that way , because inside I was alert . I watched people , kept score . I learned how not to make the same mistake twice when all around me I saw fools who added two plus two and got twenty-two . A big number , certainly , but wrong . " Angelbertha , do n't judge a book by its cover . " " You 're mad at me . " She looked down as she walked , her round face doubling in on itself . Her skin was the same color as mine , a light shade of medium brown . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trying to connect them to me by way of family color . Angelbertha would fit into my family . " I 'm not mad at you , Angelbertha . " It just seemed to me that mostly everybody I knew did n't really know what they were talking about . But on the other hand , they were right about everything in a way that I was n't . So I decided I had better change my personality before the tryouts . I had six weeks ; that was enough time . The tryout committee had  | never met me . Mr. Peterson , the band director , had never spoken to me , did n't know who I was yet . For all anybody on the drill team knew , I could be an extrovert . The girls who went to Fairlawn High School had last names that were exotic to me . Names like Schlosser , Baumer , Wonka , Van Zlike . They seemed so different from me . When I told Mama how delicately they stirred the pancake batter with a wooden spoon in home economics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That 's because they got a maid to do everything for them . They never mixed up pancake batter before . " I doubted that . These girls had mixed pancake batter . They knew the right spoon to use , and they were careful with the batter , as Mama did not have the patience to be . In my social studies class I sat behind a little girl named Mindy Madigan . Mindy 's yellow hair fascinated me in a way that Kathy 's and Karen 's mousy brown hair had not . Mindy 's hair lay flat to her head and curled up at the tips . I studied her hair like a minister studies the Bible . Instead of correcting homework with the rest of the class , I kept my head down low , pretending to mark my paper , but my eyes were rolled up to Mindy 's hair . I 'd count the number of gold strands , the number of white ones , the yellow ones . To me her hair was the same as the hair on the baby dolls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angel on top of our tree . Those nights , before I went to bed I put my hair on pink sponge rollers . I smoothed my hair below my ears , then rolled it pinch-tight , so tight I could n't sleep . But in the morning , the result was perfect : my hair lay almost flat to my head , then curled in a sausage roll all the way around my head just below my ears . One afternoon when we corrected homework , I felt something crawling through my hair . At the front of the room Mrs. Walker dragged chalk across the blackboard , explaining what she called the " colonization of the subcontinents , " for the benefit of the students who had missed the question on the previous night 's homework . I looked up from Mindy 's hair just in time to see Mrs.  | Walker looking ; at me , stabbing her chalk at the thing she had drawn on the hoard . " Martha , " she said , in that **36;0;TOOLONG **84;38;TOOLONG voice , " please tell us what continent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the back of my head , barely moving my hail , I swatted it . My hand brushed against something hard sticking ( nit of my curl . A pencil . " Ummttt , totttinent ? " I pulled out the pencil , but I felt something else , two paper clips . The boy who sat in back of me laughed softly , " Well , maybe it 's Australia ? " I felt the back of my head . I wanted to tell her , Look at Dave ! See what he 's doing to me ! " No . " Walker was impatient . That voice of hers lied . " Would like to make another guess ? " She ran the chalk around the'Ottcline again , emphasizing the hump on the left side and the to wt the bottom . I could I Dave 's breath on my neck . " Hey , hey . How do you get your to do that ? It 's like a shelf . " Mrs. Walker waited , chalk pointing to the board . " Umm , continent ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her creature . " Do n't you recog this ? " From behind , Dave whispered . " Hey , hey , is your hair real ? What do do to make it so hard ? " " Umm is t hat a continent ? " Mrs. W ker tossed her chalk in the tray . " Yes , it 's a continent ! One you teed t o study . " That might I did n't put my hair up in the pink rollers . I lay with my lentil on my feather pillow , instead of feeling the rollers digging in my scalp . I prayed to God to please , please , change me . Or at least change my hair . If only He would change my hair , that would be ugh . Make it straight , make it long , make it lie flat on my head , I 'd do anything if only He would change my hair . I prayed , Please , Lord , I have faith . Amen .  | When I woke up in the morning I still had nappy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Shavonne asked impatiently . " Your stupid little prayer or your stupid little wish for straight hair ? " " Praying ai n't stupid , honey , " Nettie Lee said . " Many 's the time saying a prayer was the only thing I could do . " " What good did it do you ? " " What you mean , what good did it do me ? You see I 'm sitting right here , still alive . That 's proof enough prayer did me some good . " " Please . " Martha tried to explain . " I was disgusted with myself . I guess for asking God to perform such a ludicrous miracle . " And there was something more . " I was disgusted with God for not performing my silly miracle anyway , because I needed it so badly . " " God ai n't no fool , " Shavonne said . " He ai n't about to give you something as stupid as straight hair just because you ca n't deal with your own black self . I mean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then I could ask Him for a million dollars and get it . " Have n't you ever asked God for anything ? " " I said I woulda had a million dollars already . Ask LaRone if she ever prayed . " " Shut up . " " Go on and ask her about the time she thought she was preg-nant . " From her chair , LaRone sighed loudly . " Turned out to be more than just a thought , did n't it , girl ? " " Maybe you ought to stop talking so much and have some more thoughts , Shavonne . " LaRone sounded uninterested in what she was saying . " Excuse me ? " " You heard me . You talk too much . " " I was quiet during the story . "  | " Well , you 're not totally rude , then . " " Mmnh . Well , I see the way this conversation is headed . " Nettie Lee said , " I never did have a notion to get something a white person had . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foolish sitting on top of my head . When . I was that age , I guess I was wishing for the same kinds of things , like a better head of hair . I just was n't thinking about no white people . Of course , everybody in my school was colored  --  or black , like they say now ? but changing my looks just never was a notion I held . " " African American , " Shavonne said . " Well , it do n't matter what you call us , we know who we are . " " Nuh-unh . Some black folks , African American folks , do n't act like they know who they are . They so busy trying to get what the white man got they ca n't appreciate their own culture . Then somebody like Vanilla Ice or Marky Mark come along and rip us off and get paid for it . And on top of that , here come our own men with those same old blond girls on they arms . Tell me that ai n't some shit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grant and Derrick , their rockers moving together in the same rhythm . " Ca n't nobody tell you nothing once you get started , Shavonne . " " Shut up , LaRone . " " I 've got another story for you then , since you did n't care for the first one . " " What 's this one about ? " Nettie Lee said . " My brother . " " Well , let me get a fresh baby . I done wore this one out . " While Nettie Lee put Mooney back in her incubator , Martha continued rocking Whiting . He slept now , his small hard head cradled into her breast . His chapped lips made drowsy sucking motions . Shavonne stood up and began stretching her legs . Martha got up and laid Whiting in his Isolette , then went through the ritual of unclipping Brown . Nettie Lee returned to the rocker with O'Neil . LaRone still held Daquille . After bending over in a complete rag doll flop , Shavonne came  | back to her chair and sat down . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going to be quiet . Continue on with your marathon storytelling session . " My brother , Michael , used to save ants . First he 'd try to kill them , then he 'd try to save them . If it worked , he 'd keep them in an aquarium full of dirt in his room . Sometimes he could n't save the ants , but he always tried , and that is what 's important . My family moved to Amberley Oaks Drive on the Tuesday after the Fourth of July , since Daddy could n't wait until the weekend . Mama packed up the dishes and all the household things you 'd expect , but one thing she tried to wrestle onto the moving truck just did n't fit : her rusty trash barrel from South Euclid Street . Most of the green paint was scorched off from all the trash Mama burned . Rain had gotten into the barrel and rusted it down the sides , and the bottom had finally fallen out . She told Boo , Daddy 's friend , to put the barrel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Daddy said we were n't taking any junk . " How 'm I suppose to burn my trash without a can ? " Mama 's voice rose up . She leaned into the truck , examining what Daddy had already loaded . " You wo n't need no can where we moving . " Daddy looked at me with that smile he always used  --  like he and I knew more than Mama . " You ca n't take the country out of some people , " he said , looking at me . " Ca n't force it out of some people . " Mama ignored Daddy and took the barrel anyway . She said Daddy was n't practical . She put the barrel behind the peony bush in our new backyard . It was hidden way out back by the privacy hedge that closed off our yard from our neighbor 's . The bush 's leaves were soft green and fresh , the flowers pink . The first time I stuck my face into one of them , six or seven big red and black ants ran out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my face made me scream and slap them off . As pretty as the flowers were , I knew not to bother them after that .  | Amberley Oaks Drive was a wide clean sweep of blacktop that I could follow to a rise at the end of the block . Our neighbors ' houses were big . They looked like libraries or schools . Though our house was a good size , we lived in the smallest , plainest house on the block . Directly across from us sat a two-story red-brick fortress with black shutters , the yard neat as a checkerboard . Two little round bushes guarded either side of the front door . I could see the front tire of a tricycle peeking around the side of the house , the only sign that people lived there . The house next to that one looked like a picture I had seen in Mama 's Redbook , a bald-faced red-brick square set on a rise of clipped grass parted precisely down the middle by a strip of sidewalk . I was afraid the doors would open and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , ask me what my family was doing moving onto their street . The night before we moved , at dinner , Daddy had folded the newspaper and waved at Mama . " Look at this , Lil . We in this paper tonight . " Mama did n't get up to look . " What 's it say ? " He tapped the paper against the dinette table twice . " About us moving here . Telling the people , Do n't panic ! Do n't sell your house ! Stay put ! " He laughed and slapped the paper against the dinette table , knocking over his water glass . The water seeped under his plate . Mama sat at the end of the table , elbows planted on top , waving her fork in the air . " Do n't panic ! " she said and laughed with him . The first time Mama burned trash at our new house was a Friday evening after dinner . We 'd lived there a little over a week . From a stool I 'd pulled up to the kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the backyard , carrying grocery sacks of garbage out to the privacy hedge . As she disappeared behind the peonies , I could hear the tin cans in the bags rattle . I heard her dump the sacks in the barrel , then she must have put a match to it . Smoke drifted over the top of the peony bush , carrying the  | smell of burning newspaper , then scorching tin . A minute later , Mama came back into the house and let the fire burn by itself . When she passed through the kitchen , she said , " Keep away from that fire , girl . It 'll burn your behind ! " Even though I had planned on going out to the fire as soon as she left , I said , " All right , Mama . " The minute I heard her in the living room , setting up the ironing board , I took off my gym shoes and socks and left them by the sink . Mama did n't hear me go out the back door . The lawn in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scratched the tiny , stinging cuts around my ankles while thick smoke curled from the trash barrel . I looked around for something to burn , trying a few peony leaves , tossing in a couple of twigs . The fire suddenly burned hot , the smoke all but gone as the air shimmered with heat . Tin cans popped , and sparks burst out from deep inside the barrel . I stepped back from the heat to watch the fire grow and consume the trash , then die back to a steady ashy glow . Twilight changed to dark ; a few lightning bugs came out . Mama turned on the lights in the house . Behind me , I heard the privacy hedge rustle . Michael moved up close behind me , placing his hands on my shoulders , watching the fire . " Hey , little sis , where Mama at ? " " She 's ironing . " I turned to look at him . He was in his same old clothes : tan chinos and a light blue shirt with a button-down collar . Unless he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything else . He had n't had any dates since we moved . He pulled a folded-up white envelope from the back pocket of his trousers and smoothed out the creases . " What 's that for ? " I said . " Salvation . " I did n't know what he was talking about . " Who wrote you a letter ? Carnette ? " " It ai n't no love letter . " He bent back the flap and spread his dark fingers inside to show me it was empty . " Do n't do no good to be in love with somebody you never going to see again . " He  | pulled a peony off the bush and shook it over the pocket of the envelope . " You ca n't shake them out , " I told him . " They run in the middle and hide . " He kept on shaking . " Why do you want to catch those things ? " He pulled the pink petals from the outside of the flower and threw them on the ground . " Come on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran onto his hand . He grunted , dropped the flower and the envelope , brushed at his hand . " Here . " He gave me the envelope . " Hold this open . " I cupped it open while he picked the ants from the center of the peony and dropped them in . They ran up the sides , their black butts swinging with the effort of trying to escape . Michael frowned as he touched them . " Are you going to keep them in the aquarium in your room ? " He had n't unpacked his bug collection since we moved . " No , that 's kid 's stuff . I might throw all that junk out . " Since he got a steady girlfriend , he worked hard at leaving what he called " kid 's stuff " alone . When Mama found out about Carnette , she said Michael was acting too mannish . Daddy grinned and said , " Go on , son . Show ' em what you got . " " Here , Marth , give me that thing now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dropped it into the envelope . Then he wet his finger and ran it along the glue on the flap , sealing it shut . He tossed the envelope into the barrel . It lay on the ashes for a few seconds , then the heat ate brown half circles into the edges ; smoke trickled out of the corners . Michael stared into the can , hands hanging at his sides , but before the envelope caught , he reached in and plucked it out . It still smoldered . Only the edges had burned . " I saved their lives , " he said . He blew on the envelope , then stuck the ants in his back pocket and walked to the house . Mama did n't like ants in the house ; she 'd already told Michael that . She said a house that had ants in it meant the people who lived there were nasty . " Mama 's going to whip your butt . "  | He turned around . " Mama ca n't do nothing . So do n't be squealing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next Saturday , glopped on in red paint : NIGERS ARE TRASH ! A red drip hung at the bottom of each letter . I rubbed my hand over NIGERS , to smudge it out before I had to read it twice , but I only ended up with chalky white paint from the bricks scuffed into my palms . I do n't know why that word made me so mad . I 'd heard Daddy say it plenty of times . He 'd say Boo was a " stupid nigger " or " You ca n't tell niggers nothing . " When Daddy said it , I did n't think anything about it . But this mess on our house was different . I slapped my hand against the bricks . Michael 's window scraped open . He stuck his head out , squint-ing . " Marth , what the hell ? Why you always got to get up so early ? " " Read this . " He looked down the wall , craning his neck sideways , but I could tell he did n't get it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later he stood beside me in his pajama bottoms , reading the message on the wall . He was quiet for a moment ; then all he said was , " The stupid son-of-a-bitches ca n't even spell , " before he went back into the house . When Mama saw the paint she did n't say a word . She stood in front of the wall , big and silent , and did n't speak . I was n't surprised . By then I 'd heard her stutter on the phone to bill collectors , or seen her wrap her lips around her teeth in embarrassment , when all she really wanted to do was simply smile . I was used to her plugged-up silences , her unwillingness to let go of her thoughts . " Do we have to move ? " I asked her . It seemed like I was the only one who was happy there , and that seemed like a thin thread to sew things together with . Still , her eyes were on the wall . " We ai n't moving . We ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . Mama bought a can of white paint to cover up the red , but no  | matter how many coats she slathered on , the words bled through . Not enough to read , but enough to remember they were there . Those words bothered me all summer ; then in September school started and I forgot about it . The smudge just became part of the house . October came . The air turned sharp ; the leaves on all the trees fired with color : reds , purples , oranges . Michael was late coming home from school the Friday before Halloween . Mama was at work . Daddy , too . I was lying on the couch reading Mama 's True Love Story magazine when I heard the front door muffle closed . Michael was sneaking in . I held the magazine to my face , pretending to read it , in case he wanted to check on me . After I counted to thirty , I went looking for him . He was in his bedroom , leaning toward the long mirror on top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ripped at the shoulder seam , torn half off . Dirt smeared the back of his shirt and trousers . I watched him gently finger his bottom lip , then his right eye , the motion soft and hesitant . In the mirror , his expression hardened and he swung around . " What you staring at ? " His shirt front was stained bright red , his lower lip swollen and shiny . " Who 'd you fight ? " I kept my mouth tight to keep from throwing up . " I did n't fight nobody . " He punched the air with his fist . His shirt gaped open at the shoulder . " Motherfuckers ran away . " He was crying , so I started to cry too . " Go on out of here , " he told me . " Go on back downstairs and read your magazine . " I was so afraid , I did exactly that . " Go out to the tree and get me a long switch . " I looked up from True Love Story to see Mama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " long " so I 'd know I should break off a big branch . She still had her work clothes on , a pink housekeeping dress from the air force base , and stockings , and crepe-soled  | shoes . Her hair still held its workday curl , a sausage-roll that touched her shoulders . " Who are you going to whip ? " " Go do what I said or you 'll be next . " From the maple tree on the left side of the lawn , I chose a long sucker branch sprouting from the bottom of the trunk . When Mama heard the screen door slam , she called out for me to come up to Michael 's room . They were both standing in front of the mirror , looking at each other : Michael , tall , thin , and sullen , his chin thrust out , and Mama , dressed for work , arms folded over her chest , her lips mashed together in a hard frown . Without looking at me , Mama reached back her hand . I put the switch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air , held it over Michael 's head . He lowered his eyes halfway , still looking at her . " Go on and do what you gon na do . " " Do n't you sass me in this house ! " she said , bringing the switch down on his shoulders . " I will not tolerate sass in this house ! I told you to stay away from that girl . " With every word she spoke , her arm raised and the switch sounded . Whup ! Whup ! " Mama , I do n't go near those people . That simple-acting sister of theirs lies . They follow me ! They jump me ; then the cowards run away . I did n't fight nobody . " Tears were in his voice . " You better hush that sass . I told you and told you till I ca n't tell you no more , stay in your own yard . Leave those people alone . " I 'd heard the other girls in my class talking about it , about what color gowns they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads , the pink lipstick they 'd wear . Everybody wanted to be a fairy princess for trick or treat . I decided on the same costume . Dressed in Mama 's old crinolines , I leaned in to her mirror and puffed her face powder against my skin . I was still too dark for a fairy princess . I shook some of Daddy 's white foot powder onto the puff and covered my face , lips , and eyes . I redrew my mouth and eyes back on with Mama 's black eyebrow pencil . I painted a  | crusty silver star on my forehead with my bottle of glitter . Tilting my head forward and back , I watched the lamplight strike glisters from my star . Michael showed up behind me , laughing his goofy brother laugh . " Girl , you look like some kind of monkey . Do n't ask me which kind . " " Then you 're a monkey 's brother . " " Come on , little sis . Since you so hot to get your candy ration , we better go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " We have to walk there ? " He yawned . " What do you think ? The President heard you want to go trick-or-treating so he sent out his limo ? " " I thought Daddy would take us . " " You know Daddy 's working overtime . " " Michael , I ca n't walk that far in high heels . " " Wear your sneaks . " " I 'm supposed to be a fairy princess ! " " You got that right . " He ran his hand over his hair , making a bristly , electric sound . " Oh , for chrissake , let 's go before it gets too dark . " He started for the bedroom door . " We can just go around here . " " Who you think 's going to give you candy around here ? " He raised his eyebrows . " Everybody , " I said . " The whole damn neighborhood . They 're all waiting for me . Okay ? " " Shut up , Marth . And get your coat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited . " You think you 're pretty bossy , " I said . " You 're not Mama or Daddy . You 're nobody . " We were almost out the front door before I realized he was n't dressed for trick or treat . He had on his same old chinos and shirt . I said , " Why do n't you put a costume on ? At least look like you know it 's Halloween . " " I ai n't in the spirit of it , " he said . " I 'm just taking you out because Mama told me to keep you out of trouble . "  | " Will you put on a costume ? Please ? " I pulled out one of his hands and held it against my face . " Do n't get that shit on me ! " " Please ? " " Oh , for chrissake , all right . You damn sure are a fairy prin-cess . " He took the stairs two at a time . " I 'll be down in a min-ute . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a black undershirt , with one of Mama 's black stockings pulled over his face . He 'd tied the end of it up into a Woody Woodpecker topknot . His nose was smashed to the side like rubber . " A cat burglar , " I said , admiring how he could change himself into something he was n't . " That 's a good one , Michael . " " Yeah , I 'm a second-story man , if you can get ready for that . Let 's go . " He pulled his jacket on and we went to the door . " No , wait a minute . " He yanked the stocking off his face . " I ca n't breathe with this thing on , " he said , and stuffed it in his pocket . While we 'd been talking , it had gotten dark . A lot of kids were on the streets  --  ghosts and skeletons and hoboes and princesses , swinging their flashlights , squealing and running  --  yet our doorbell had n't rung once . I thought about what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the first house was to prove he was wrong . He waited on the sidewalk while I walked through the yard to a small porch . I climbed the steps , passed between two long white columns , and stood in front of a huge door painted glassy white . A brass plaque in the middle of the door said THE HAVERFORDS . I saw them every day on their way to work . He dressed in gray suits . She was a high school teacher . Mrs. Haverford opened the door with a silly , surprised , wideeyed welcoming look , as if she were expecting a pirate or a vampire , as if prepared to scream politely before she handed over the candy . But when she saw me , she wiped her face clean and swung the door closed with a thunk . Back on the sidewalk , I could barely make out Michael in his  | black shirt and pants . I could n't see much more than his movements ; he kept looking back at everyone who passed him . I balled up my pillowcase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So what 'd you get ? " " A Milky Way , " I said . " Big one . " " Oh , yeah ? Well , they got a lot of money . They can afford to be nice . Let 's keep going then . " The next house belonged to the Koenigsbergs . I would babysit their little girl sometimes . I knew Mrs. Koenigsberg would open the door for me , smile at me , say something nice . On the day we moved in , Mr. Koenigsberg came into our yard to shake my father 's hand . Their house was dark , all lights out ; I felt let down . I did n't want to go to the other houses on our block . What was the point ? When I told Michael , he shrugged and said , " You doing all right . You got that big candy bar . Why stop now ? " " Let 's go someplace else , someplace we 've never been . " He looked interested . " You want to go over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses are . More candy for you . " My empty sack was light in my hands , and I did n't want to go home with nothing . We walked three streets up , then one over . I 'd never had a reason to go this far ; school was the other way . The houses rose up high , shadowed by tall trees , but dim lights glowed , and I took comfort in that . Our house sat right out on the street ; anybody could look in our windows anytime and see what we were doing . These houses hid their owners behind brick walls , trees , shrubbery , deep lawns . At the first house I went to , an old man with colorless eyes opened the door and said , " Who are you ? " I watched his Adam 's apple bob in his skinny throat . I felt the dark porch furniture hulking around me on all sides . I jumped down off the porch and ran out of his yard , back to the sidewalk . " What 's wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jammed into his pants pockets . It must have been late . The other kids had gotten their candy and gone home .  | " Let 's go home now . It 's cold and I 'm scared . " " Of what ? Ai n't nobody here . " " That makes it worse . Let 's go home . " " All right . Got your bag ? " I did n't have it . I looked at the old man 's porch . He had gone back into the house . " I dropped it back there . " Michael looked at the house . " Dang ! " he said . " I ca n't see nothing up there . What 'd you drop it for ? " " I do n't know ! Let 's just go . " " Stay here . " He started up the walk . " By the porch ? " " Yeah . In the grass . " He disappeared in a couple of steps , like the dark opened up and let him in . I stood on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to get out of there , to run home , but instead I ran up the walk , through the dark to Michael . Before I could get to him , the yard lights blazed on , the house sprang forward , and I stopped . In the grass , Michael crouched over my empty pillowcase , his head lifted toward the porch , his face alert . I heard a pop like a cap gun . Michael fell backward out of his crouch , as if someone had placed a finger against his forehead and given him a little push . I ran through the old man 's yard , across the grass , straight to Michael . He was stretched out in the grass , one arm resting on his chest , the other flung out to his side , holding the pillowcase . I leaned on my knees beside him , afraid to touch him . On my knees , I bent over him , my ear to his mouth . I prayed to hear him breathe , but I could n't hear . And I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could n't hear him , and he had to get up and leave before the old man got us . We had to hurry up and get out of there . We had to go . We got to be in the newspaper again . This time , there was a picture of Mama and Daddy , staring straight into the camera . Beneath it , the caption said , The Harrises lost their son . I 've still got that picture in an album at home . I do n't take it out too often ,  | but sometimes I do , and I think about that time when everybody seemed so mute : Mama , Daddy , even Michael . Sometimes I can still see Michael in his room , pretending to have a girl in his arms , dancing . Eyes closed , he 'll swing her out , to the tips of his fingers , then curl her back into his arms , tuck his head to fit hers on his shoulder , and dip forward , letting her feel the weight of his chest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Naw , " Nettie Lee said . " Ai n't nothing changed . " " I do n't know . " LaRone drew her baby in close . " I hear so much talk about prejudice being on the rise . But I hope for the best , then usually that 's what I get . My philosophy is : I just try to take people like I find them . " Shavonne cleared her throat loudly . " What about skinheads , LaRone ? They 'd take you somewhere nobody would find you . " " I just want to raise my child in an environment where things like race do n't matter . " " Shoot . What planet you going to live on ? Wait , I know . You going to live on Planet Peaceful , where people call each other brother and sister , and they got wild animals for pets because lions and tigers do n't bite . LaRone , you got to stop living in the Age of Aquarius . " " Well , maybe we should all be hopeful for the world LaRone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel hopeful herself . She felt exhausted . " Ladies , I 'm done for the day . You can solve the world 's problems without me . I 'm going home . " " See you tomorrow . " Nettie Lee looked tired too , Martha thought . As if she were  --  well , plagued by some problem . Martha thought about this on her way out of the nursery to the locker room to get her coat . And she thought about Nettie Lee in the elevator , but by the time she had clutched her coat to her throat and walked outside to the bus stop , Nettie Lee had slipped from her mind .  | Nettie Lee stood at her granddaughter 's Isolette , watching the baby twitch in her sleep . She lay on her side , one thin arm flung across her barrel chest , the other arm wedged beneath her on the mattress . A respirator tube trailed from her mouth , trembling with the force of compressed oxygen . Nettie Lee found herself breathing with the respirator 's rhythm : a prolonged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood for a while breathing in and out , panting almost , with the baby , but she could n't keep up with the respirator 's fast pace without feeling dizzy . She sighed aloud and resumed her own slow rhythm . The baby looked okay , not critical like they said she was , although Nettie Lee was willing to admit she could n't tell a critical baby from a stable one in this place . That was all the more reason to name the baby , she thought . Even if she was the only one who knew what the name was . To come up with a good name , she 'd have to think on it . But for now , I'ma keep on calling you Tookie , because you so sweet . You just like a piece of candy . With a cotton ball , she dabbed at a drop of water collected in the corner of the baby 's eye . Got to keep you comfortable and dry . Got to keep your oxygen level up , your breathing quiet . Got to keep your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loudly . Who was she kidding ? She was falling apart . She wanted nothing so much as to gather this baby into her arms and get the hell out of there , especially since it looked like Martha had designs on her . But if she took the baby away from all these machines , all the doctors and nurses , she was sure to die . Then again , if Nettie Lee stayed here , how long could she pretend she had nothing to do with the baby ? As it was , she felt like she was giving herself away every time she looked across the nursery to the warming tray , every time she sat at the table while that social worker talked about foster care for Baby Doe , every time some hospital worker came to the nursery asking if that was Baby X over there on the tray . What had she thought she would accomplish by coming here ? What good was it doing her , the baby , or Yolanda ? It was hard to tell if she had done the right thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoped for  --  seeing her granddaughter , letting her know she was n't alone in the world ? went off okay . Here she was . But  --  Nettie Lee sighed with exasperation  --  it was n't enough for the baby somehow . Tookie deserved more than to lie on this table like some kind of sick experiment . She wanted to take her grandbaby home . Nettie Lee thought of what Martha had said in Report the day before , that she was looking to be a foster parent for a preemie . It was clear to her that Martha had only one baby in mind : hers . She 'd seen Martha mooning around Tookie 's bed , looking at her , touching her . It would be too crazy if the hospital gave her baby to Martha , while she had to sit silent and never tell anybody she was Tookie 's grandmother . Debbie Foxx had been standing at Cruz 's Isolette , talking to his mother and her friend , and now she came over to Nettie Lee . She looked at the baby . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't she ? " Nettie Lee did n't answer . " You 're not getting too attached , are you ? " Debbie placed her hand on Nettie Lee 's shoulder . " That 's like a rule we 're supposed to have around here . Do n't get too attached . " She laughed as if  | truly delighted . " I 'd just like someone to come in here and specifically tell me how to avoid that . Someone could give us all a lecture on it . Some nonattachment expert . " " Yeah , I could use some expert help . " " We all could , " Debbie agreed . " Well , back in the real world . I have an extra job for you today . " " What 's that , honey ? " Nettie Lee balled up the cotton into her hand . Debbie let her eyes trail away from Nettie Lee and fall on LaRone Cruz , her friend Shavonne , and a man Nettie Lee did n't know , all standing by Daquille 's Isolette . The man kissed LaRone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his yellow gown hanging far above his knees and straining at his chest . LaRone stood by awkwardly while the redheaded nurse lifted the baby out . " He 's going home as soon as he reaches five pounds , " Debbie told her . " That 's his grandpa leaving . He comes in sometimes , even when Mom is n't here , usually during the night shift . " Debbie looked back at Nettie Lee . " Mom needs to be shown how to give the bath . Would you do it ? " " All right . " She left her thoughts of Tookie behind and followed Debbie over to the two girls . LaRone sat down in a rocker , then stretched out her arms to receive her baby from the redheaded nurse . " Miss Cruz , Mrs. Johnson will be helping you with the bath , " Debbie told her . " Just take your time and ask her anything you want to . If she does n't have the answer , she can ask me . Both the grandmothers are here to help you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a grandmother at home to show you how to care for your baby . " " That 'd be a joke , " Shavonne said . " I beg your pardon ? " Debbie looked at Shavonne , confusion spreading across her face . Shavonne , still standing at the Isolette , puckered her mouth and nodded .  | She said , " Having my grandmother at home would n't work out too well , since my mother put her out of the house . " " Oh , " Debbie said . " Well , that 's what our grandmothers are here for  --  they can fill in the gaps our own relatives leave . I want Nettie Lee to show you how to bathe Daquille this morning . " " I was going to feed him now . " The clock read 9:30 . " You 're actually a little early for the ten o'clock . " " I know , but Shavonne got an appointment at wic , and I told her I 'd go with her since it 's her first one . " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lee asked . LaRone looked at Nettie Lee for a long moment , then said yes and rolled her eyes up to Shavonne . Daquille had settled into his mother 's arms and now peeked out from his hood of blankets . His face was alert , cautious . " wic is a program to give extra nutrition to mothers and their children , " Debbie told Nettie Lee . " The mothers can get more milk and formula if they go in and take parenting classes . " Nettie Lee nodded . " It sounds like something beneficial . " She asked LaRone , " Wont Wick wait for you to take care of your child ? You ca n't be two places at one time . " " She told you I got an appointment , " Shavonne said . " I miss my appointment time , they wo n't make another one for me until next week . " " Mmm-hmm , " LaRone said . " Them people do n't care what you have to go through to get there . They got so many people down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you had something else to do and that 's why you 're late . They just tell you to go on home and come back next week . You 'll just be one less person they have to deal with . " " That 's how those people are , " Shavonne said . " They all the same . " She turned away , pretending interest in a large group of noisy medical students coming in for rounds . " You go ahead and show LaRone how to give a bath , " Debbie  | told Nettie Lee . She took the nurser from LaRone . " I 'll defrost some more breast milk when you 're done . " " What 's wrong with her ? " LaRone said . Then she said , raising the pitch of her voice , " ' You go ahead and do like I told you to . Your opinion ai n't shit . ' " " She ai n't usually like that , honey . I guess she got things on her mind this morning . " Nettie Lee pushed the bath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it  --  the plastic tub , liquid soap , body lotion , several large towels , a facecloth . " You can stay put in your chair and hold Daquille on your lap for the bath . " Nettie Lee filled up the washtub in the sink . The water felt warm , just right . " Daquille is a nice name for your baby . Where did you get it from ? " " Thanks . " LaRone smoothed the hair on her baby 's head with a long fingernail , pink this time . " I made it up . " " That is a cute name , " Shavonne said . " LaRone 's going to help me with a name for my baby . I want a name that expresses her in-dividuality . " " You having a girl for sure ? " " As sure as they can be . " Shavonne sat down next to LaRone , in the rocker Martha liked to use , and began to rock , pushing off with her toes . " The doctor said with a girl the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy . He said with a boy you can actually see his little thing , but with a girl what you 're looking at is the absence of a thing . " She laughed . " It sounds wack but it makes sense , do n't it ? " " Yeah , it does , " LaRone said . " It 's kind of a shock , is n't it ? When you see the baby moving around on that TV screen , and you think , All that 's inside of me . " She smiled down at her baby . " I liked that . " " It made me sick , " Shavonne said . " I looked at that TV and I said to myself , " Nuh-unh , girl . No way . That baby is in there and swimming around , and swallowing that nasty pee it 's swimming in , and growing big , and then it 's going to want to come out . No . Shavonne ai n't playing that . "  | " Who do you think is going to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have that baby , Shavonne . You and nobody else . " " I know . I be tripping about it sometime . Sometime I think I 'll beg the doctor to give me a C-section , so I can have the baby when I 'm asleep . " " You do n't want a C-section . They hurt too much after . I was in a room with a girl that had one , and she kept us up all night with her complaining . " " You better show up when I 'm in labor , girl . I better not call you and you say you going to miss . " " I said I 'd be your labor coach . Stop worrying about it . " " Where 's your mama ? " Nettie Lee asked , setting the basin of water on the cart . " Ca n't she help you any ? " She wheeled the cart back to the rocker . LaRone and Shavonne cut their eyes to each other . Shavonne snickered . " You do n't want to hear nothing about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know her behind from a hole in the ground . " She turned to LaRone . " And she got the nerve to say that about me . " " Your mother 's wack , " LaRone said , without enthusiasm . " Tell me about it . " Shavonne looked at Nettie Lee . " I do n't mean to disrespect you  --  what 's your name  --  Nettie Lee , but I think I 'm best off figuring out my life for myself . Considering the great job you so-called grown-ups have done so far . " " Mmm-hmm , " LaRone said . " And let me tell you something else . Everything I got now , I got on my own , did n't have Mommy and Daddy helping me , because , girl , I do n't even know where Mommy and Daddy are half the time , unless I see one of them out on the street . And I do not care . I know I can take care of myself . I know what 's best for me better than anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , save it . " She leaned back in the rocker and closed her eyes . Nettie Lee watched her belly rise and fall in great heaves , imagined the baby turning inside . She pulled the cart close to LaRone 's rocker , dipped the washcloth in the warm water , and wrung it out . " Here . " She extended  | the cloth . " Start with his face and head , then go on to the rest of his body . " " Do I need soap ? " " Not on his face . We 'll put some soap on the rag when you get to his body , but then we got to remember to wash it all off so it do n't irritate his skin . His skin is going to be really sensitive to things like soap and maybe even lotion and the detergent you wash his clothes in . Any baby is sensitive , but he 's a preemie , so you got to worry more when it comes to life on the outside . " " He could n't stay inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it was a few weeks early . " " Yeah , " Nettie Lee said . " But I was talking about outside the nursery , where you got to protect him from germs and chemicals . You got to make sure he eats right  --  you see he eats every two hours in here , do n't you ? You got to keep up his schedule at home too . And you got to make sure he gets his rest . All he 's going to want to do when you get him home is sleep , so let him . Keep your apartment quiet and warm as you can . Make sure his crib do n't sit in a draft . Here . " She pulled the blanket over Daquille 's chest and arms . " After you wash a part , cover it up so he do n't get cold during the bath . " LaRone nodded . " Later , when he 's got more fat on him , you can give him a regular tub bath . For now , just think of him being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from getting exposed to things he just ai n't up to . " During the ten o'clocks , as she rocked and fed Gonsalves , Nettie Lee watched LaRone prepare to feed her baby . She had told Shavonne to go ahead to wic by herself , since she had to take care of Daquille , but Shavonne stayed . Martha sat in a rocker with Riley . The redheaded nurse  --  Callie Hart  --  handed LaRone a fresh cylinder of donor breast milk . She tentatively nudged her baby 's mouth with the nipple , and he tensed his forehead in concentration , opening his mouth wide , his head jerking toward it . He latched on and sucked the milk in quick little pulls . Sitting beside LaRone in a rocker , Shavonne watched her friend feed the  | baby and absently kicked her foot against the IV stand Daquille no longer used . Nettie Lee cleared her throat . " Martha , did I ever tell you about how I came to live here in Dayton ? " She said " Martha , " but she looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martha answered . " But you look like you might do it now . " " I was n't too much younger than these two young ladies right here . We were sick of where we stayed and how we lived , but we could n't make the move until my mama got herself some courage . " Shavonne looked at LaRone . " She be telling stories just like my grandma . Granny got to tell you her old-timey stories or she bust . " " Yeah , " LaRone said . " They be talking about things that happened way back when , like it got something to do with right now . And she thinks she sly , slipping something she wants you to know into the story , like you ca n't tell that 's what she doing . " She sat forward in her chair . " Okay , listen to this : My granny be trying to tell me about sex one day when I was fourteen , and she said , Now do n't stay out on the street at night because a boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put his finger up in your panties . ' His finger ! " I said , Granny , that 's weak . Boys do more than that if they catch you . ' Then she 's looking all flustrated with me , trying to get me to tell her if anybody done anything to me yet . That 's none of her damn business . Besides , by the time I was fourteen I knew more about sex than she did . She thinks if you do n't talk about sex it means you ai n't doing nothing . I kept on telling that lady to wake up and smell the cappuccino . " She snapped her fingers . " It 's the nineties . " " I thought you ai n't seen your grandma since your mother put her out , " Nettie Lee said . " I 'm talking about before then . " She gave LaRone a look . " My grandma get so senile she be talking about something , and she ca n't remember what she said in the middle of it . You have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her point . "  | " Your grandma trips a lot , but she 's okay , " LaRone said . " I thought you said you were going to wic ? " " Shoot , I can go over there some other time . I 'm tired . " LaRone shook her head and turned to Nettie Lee . " So what happened that made you move here ? " " Oh , Lord . What you want to get her started for , LaRone ? I 'm telling you , once they get their mouths on something , grandmas do n't even know when to stop . " I 'm going to tell you about the time my mama got herself some courage . Up until then , she 'd was a mealy-mousy person . Real meek . If somebody say , " Boo ! " she 'd jump ten feet in the air . If somebody say , " Give me the draws on your behind , " she 'd snatch those panties right off . And feel bad about it too , like she ca n't say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage of her . But she always had this saying , " The worm will turn , " that she 'd end her conversations with . Stop everybody cold , do n't matter who running their mouth , laughing at her , telling her she backwards or whatever . " The worm will turn , " she 'd say . " The worm will turn . " M'Dear came from a poor little country town called North Kenova , stuck in the north corner of West Virginia where it meets Kentucky and Ohio . She talked about that place like being there was some kind of paradise and heaven rolled into one . She 'd call it Down Home . Everything good be happening Down Home . " Down Home we had us some kinda good food . Collard greens , sweet-potato pie , fresh-killed bacon . Ca n't get us none of that in Chicago . " And she 'd say , " Wondering what Ruthie Mae up to Down Home ? Betcha she in that of garden patch of hers right now . Girl probably hoeing the weeds out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M'Dear to shut up about Down Home . He do n't want to hear no fuss about someplace country . He came up from Clarksdale , Mississippi , and could n't get out of there fast enough . Clarksdale , Mississippi , the birthplace of the blues , though it seems to me he brought the blues with him  | when he got off the train . Did n't want no reminders of home , neither . He said he 'd seen all the cotton fields he was going to in his lifetime , and he sure did n't want to see them in hell . Seen too many lynchings , beatings , castrations , till he ca n't see no more . He figured his turn was coming up , better get out of town . Before he hopped the train to Chicago , his brothers and his sister came up , one by one , on that same train . Daddy Walter was the baby of the family , the last one to stay and make sure his daddy was provided for . When the old man died , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a train ticket , and was gone twenty minutes after his daddy was laid in the ground . He saw M'Dear at church up in Chicago . Sometimes he 'd laugh and say , Church is the only place to meet a good-looking woman . Oh , you can meet them in a bar , but they 'll be just as hard-drinking as the men , and as tough too . Bar women are the ones who got the roaming urge , do n't want to stay home and cook or watch their kids . Now church , that 's where all the women who care about God sit . You can just pick one off the pew . Not that Daddy Walter cared about God . He said God is just another white man , the biggest one you ever run into , tell everybody what to do . But when it came to a wife , he wanted a woman used to minding a man . He figured bending down to God 's will was good practice for a woman . He saw M'Dear sitting on the church pew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her hair combed back into a French roll , a white tailored dress buttoned up to her neck , her legs pale and shiny in white stockings , feet crossed nice at the ankles , and he thought , Damn . Dearly beloved , gather together and let no man put us asunder because I do . M'Dear was thinking the same thing when she saw him : Here 's a nice-looking redbone man  --  yellow skin , light brown eyes , intelligent-looking . He even had nappy hair , and M'Dear liked that . She had good hair herself , from that French blood in her , but she thought it was better for a man to have naps . You ca n't trust a man with wavy hair ; he 's too stuck on himself , thinking he 's more beautiful than you are . One day after they got married , Daddy Walter surprised her ; he let their neighbor , who ran  | a beauty parlor out of her kitchen , conk his hair . When M'Dear saw his slicked-back head , she like to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore his hair from then on . You want to talk about somebody being handsome , then you got to talk about Big Daddy Walter ; he was so fine he had four girls on his arm . And M'Dear said that was the whole problem with that son-of-abitch . " Your daddy got three damn women too many . " Like so many , they started having their children before they got married . M'Dear was pregnant with Brawley at the altar . After that she had her babies right quick : Lenis and Lenetta , my older sisters ; then here come my other brothers , Acie , Egg , and Too Much . Then me , the baby . We all lived in a two-bedroom apartment on Thirty-second and Indiana Avenue . I liked to hear M'Dear talk about her life . Way Back When she called it , but I knew she was n't that old . She may have felt like she was old , but she was only thirty-four . I used to curl up with her on the couch while she read the newspaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head leaned back against the armrest . I 'd start at the hairline and pull the comb through till it reached the ends , curling her hair down over the couch arm . She liked that . She 'd say , " Knock the dandruff out , " and I 'd scratch up all the dandruff on her scalp , then comb through real fast to make the flakes fly off her hair . When I was in the sixth grade I saw that M'Dear had some gray hairs in the front and a small patch of it on top . The longer the year went on , the more gray hairs I saw , till soon they were all over her head . But those gray hairs did n't take away none of her beauty , just added to it . That year was a bad year for my whole family . Maybe all the same old things was happening , but we just took it different . One Sunday morning early in June that year , M'Dear was standing in the living room picking up from the night before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday before church . Seven o'clock in the morning . Had me out the bed cleaning too . Mostly Daddy Walter 's stuff and hers ; pint whiskey bottles his friends  | brought over in their back pockets to be sociable , M'dear 's rundown house shoes laying by the couch , some plates with oily sardine tails and cigar ashes on the coffee table . The drapes were already pulled back and the sun was just beginning to show around the top of the apartment building across the street . " Open up that window and air this place out . Smells like a whiskey factory in here . " M'Dear was standing with a little trash can in her hands , clinking the bottles in , and Daddy Walter was in the bedroom snoring as loud as he felt like , since he just got home at five . Daddy Walter spent his nights all up and down Forty-third , listening to Muddy Waters and Little Milton sing the Delta blues and play their guitars . Mama was getting real mad , listening to him snoring . The window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jiggled it hard till it finally gave way and slid up a few inches . Outside , there was n't nobody on the street . The only car parked in front of our building was Big Daddy Walter 's new red Buick , the thing he was so proud of . On the windowsill was a picture of M'Dear and Big Daddy Walter taken when M'Dear was still pregnant with me . They 're sitting in a nightclub at a long fold-up table with M'Dear 's sister Mary Catherine on one side of her and Daddy Walter on the other . There 's all kinds of people in the background , sitting at other tables and standing up talking . Mary Catherine got an evening dress on , looks like it was made out of watered silk , and cut low so it shows her bosom . M'Dear 's got on something like it , you ca n't see it too good in the picture , same fabric , but the straps are frilly instead of straight like Mary Catherine 's . M'Dear 's got her pocketbook up on the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their hair done up real nice and their faces all made up , their lips painted on . M'Dear is still skinny , and she got one elbow on the table , between the beer bottles , with her wrist bent and her fingers just barely touching her neck . Her head is cocked off to the side , but her eyes look right at the camera and a smile is on her lips . Big Daddy Walter is sitting beside her in a white suit , and his face is almost as white as the suit . Big Daddy Walter 's got a thin mustache , a bald spot on  | top of his head , and a little smile on his face like he 's enjoying himself real good . Everybody in that picture looks like they feeling good and sexy , except Mary Catherine . " Seem like every Sunday it 's the same old six and seven , " M'Dear said with her back to me , and I could n't hear what she said next . Then she turned around again . " I get tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decide to come to bed . " Then her back turned again . I already knew what this meant . I heard it while it was happening the night before . Pretty soon she went into the other kids ' bedroom and got them up and dressed for church while I scrambled eggs in the iron skillet . When they were all ready , we ate our eggs at the dinette table , then walked to church . Our church was down on Forty-ninth Street , a few doors down from the Ace of Clubs . It was a little storefront church that did n't hold too many people . Reverend Cosgrove preached there , and sometimes his assistant reverend took over if Reverend Cosgrove had to work overtime at the bus station . That Sunday morning when we walked in , Chester Applewhite , a big gangly man with womanish-looking hands , was playing on the piano a tinkly little church song made for listening to , not singing to . He had a habit of chewing bubble gum even when he played , and his mouth was going then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Up in front of us I saw Hubie Owens and his mama and daddy sitting . Hubie was in my class at school , Mrs. Thompkins 's sixth grade . Him and his friend Dairy Jones was always trying to look up my dress . Dairy 's daddy was my daddy 's boss at the Carlton Hotel restaurant , where Big Daddy Walter worked as a dishwasher on the day shift . Mr. Jones was what Big Daddy Walter called a " real cracker . " Big Daddy did n't appreciate being told what to do by nobody . He said somebody owned his daddy down south , but nobody owned him , down south or anywhere else . In Clarksdale , Big Daddy Walter was known as a " bad nigger . " That means he was hard-drinking , loud-talking , and made it a point never to say " sir " to any man . Folks was scared of him , glad when IiV  | he left town ; no telling what he might do . He was still like that in Chicago from habit . Dairy 's daddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he was sleeping on the job , got drunk before lunchtime , was too hung over to work some days , picked fights with the other men . Mr. Jones said Big Daddy Walter was just too unreliable . Reverend Cosgrove walked in through the front door a few minutes after nine , when everybody was seated . He was a tall , dark man , kind of round-headed , which was nice . And talk about sweet  --  that man had the nicest temperament I ever saw . Never a harsh word for nobody . But if you needed a good talking-to , the reverend could make you straighten up and fly right with his words . He had a gift . The reverend took the short trip up that little aisle with the people sitting on folding chairs brought out of the side closet for Sunday meetings . The place was always full ; all in all about thirty or forty people were there every Sunday . Even though he had already got up to the podium and was standing there waiting for silence , the two women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was standing up there , so they did n't quiet down like everybody else , and one of them was left with the last word . She looked at the other woman , embarrassed , and restuck the hat pin in her hat . The lady next to her was wearing a fox stole that kept staring at me over her shoulder . We all rose to sing " The Negro National Anthem , " then " Look Up for a Brighter Day Is Coming . " M'Dear did n't have much of a voice , but she was loud and the reverend appreciated it . I mouthed the words so people could n't hear my bad voice . Reverend Cosgrove thanked us for our strong voices that Sunday morning and made us sit down . " This Sunday is a special one , " he said , " because this Sunday we are going to honor those students graduating from high school . Now , I did n't go on to higher learning myself , so I do n't share their honor , but that do n't stop me from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " somebody said .  | " I said , we as parents may not have passed though the annals of education ourselves , but that do n't stop us from knowing how important education is . " " Mmm-hmm . Tell it , Reverend . " " And it do n't matter in these times now if you graduate summa cum laude . No , sir . I said , it just do n't matter how you graduate in these times the Negro is having right now . If you ca n't graduate summa cum laude , the next best thing is Thank you , Lordy ! " " Amen , Reverend . " " And I know some of you young people out there who have not completed your high school education are wondering , Shall I continue ? Shall I keep climbing the mountain of higher learning if I ca n't see the mountaintop yet ? " " That 's right . " " I said , you 're wondering if you are going to see any benefit from all the hard work , all the toil you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name of higher education . Did I hear an amen ? " " Yes , Reverend . Amen . " " But you do n't have to wonder anymore , because the answer to all your questions is sitting right beside you . Look at your fa-thers . " Reverend Cosgrove let his eyes sweep the room . " Well , then , look at your mother if your father ai n't here . See that this man or this woman is one of the pillars of the community . " I looked up at M'Dear . She had a special light coming from her eyes . I knew she felt in the spirit that morning , her hands folded in her lap , her head tipped back , the pheasant feather on her hat pointed straight up and trembling with her heartbeat . " These are the people who raised you up from nothing . Who formed you from clay , just as the Lord God made Adam and Eve from the dirt beneath His feet . " " Amen . " " Preach it , Reverend . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to thank your parents . Get down on your knees and thank the men and women  | who gave you life , and look to them for your answers . " I heard a commotion in the back row . One of the older boys , dressed in a hairy-looking brown suit and tie , was jerking his arm away from his mother 's hand . He said , " I did n't ask to be born ! " and got up and left out the door . His mother was a lady I saw at church every Sunday , but I only saw him every once in a while . She put her hand on her bosom and lifted her head to listen to the reverend . We all turned back to the front . Reverend Cosgrove pretended like he did n't see what hap-pened . " These are the happiest days of your lives , when you 're young . Now I know you may question ? " I heard a ruckus in the row ahead of me , up to the left where Hubie Owens was sitting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at me , twisting up his face to make me laugh . I looked at M'Dear . Her head was still held high in its listening pose , so I turned my head toward Hubie , just the slightest , and stuck my tongue out . M'Dear jabbed me in the side with her elbow pretty hard . She had her some bony elbows , though she was n't a little skinny woman anymore . I knew not to even look her in the face ; that would just make her mad . Even though Hubie stayed twisted around in his chair , buckteeth showing , sitting right beside his mama and daddy , who were pretending not to see him , I kept my head turned forward . As quiet as M'Dear was , she could kill you if she felt like it . Reverend Cosgrove kept on preaching his sermon , through bad kids twisting around pinching each other and babies wailing and whatnot , through boys trying to talk about " Let me have some , baby , " right there in the row behind me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admire the reverend 's concentration . And he went on like that for an hour ; then he passed the plate . When we got home M'Dear opened the door to the apartment . I could smell whiskey . Leaving the window open did . Even so , that did n't stop M'Dear from clanging her pots around while she made Sunday dinner : fried chicken , po-  | tato salad , and deviled eggs , ready at two o'clock . She took off her Sunday shoes and slipped on her house shoes . Still wearing her good clothes , she got a whole chicken out the refrigerator and chopped its head off with a cleaver . Next , the feet came off . She saved those , but she threw the head away . She cut the chicken up into nine pieces and rolled them in flour and fried them in lard . Still , Big Daddy Walter slept on . But I knew that sooner or later he was going to smell that chicken and wake up . M'Dear turned on the radio to the At Home with Brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ About Heaven " along with the choir while she cut up the potatoes to boil . I watched the way her hips swayed when she sang that song ; first she shifted to her left foot , paused for a beat , then swayed to the right . When the water got hot on the stove she dropped the potatoes into the pot . She saw me leaning on Big Daddy Walter 's card table , watching her . " Go change out of your good clothes , " she told me . " Then see if you know how to do something besides stand in the middle of the floor . " " Like what ? " " Like what ? " She could sound just like me . " Like sweep it . Get your behind in there and change your clothes , then sweep the dirt off of the floor . I got to do everything myself . Get so tired of it . Everybody else act like they blind . " I heard Big Daddy Walter roll over in the bed . M'Dear was talking too loud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some people get to sleep , and some people get to clean up after the ones who get to sleep . Well , they can sleep till they ca n't do nothing else but sleep , because the worm will turn . " " Damn . " Big Daddy Walter was still mostly asleep , but he was awake enough to be mad . " What you hollering about now ? Bad enough you have to go to that church and sit there with them Sunday Christians who ca n't act no better than they do come Monday . " The bedsprings started squeaking ; then I heard his feet thump on the floor . " The only time you catch me in  | church be to pray to the Lord to keep those kinda people away from me . " His footsteps got closer ; then Big Daddy Walter was standing in the living room in his underwear . I tried not to look at his privates , but I could n't help myself . I wondered what they looked like in there , what a man looked like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walter was . He saw me not looking at him . He put his hands on his hips and strutted over to M'Dear . " Walter , put some clothes on your behind ! " Mama put her knife down on the counter . " Run around half naked in front of the children like you ai n't got good sense . " She still had four more potatoes to cut up , and they caught her attention again . She sliced the knife through them like she was deadheading a chicken . " Why you always got to be thinking about somebody 's be-hind ? " Big Daddy Walter stuck his hands in his pants and started to scratch with a bristly , itchy sound . " Ai n't nobody care about my underwear ! " Mama chopped up potatoes so fierce you could hear the knife scrape the Formica . " I 'm going back to bed . Wake me up when you got dinner ready to eat . " He turned and walked back into their bedroom , the soles of his feet slapping the floor like wet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I liked a whole lot , just because I knew the week had got started . I got the feeling on the weekend , especially Sunday , that I was stuck in my life . Time did n't just drag along then , it stopped dead in its tracks and refused to go on . When I felt like that , I did n't want to be home with M'Dear and them . At least on Monday things got going again . I had to hurry up to get out the bed to get to school ; teachers expected to see some work from my mind . That 's the way I felt on one particular Monday that same June , like my life had wound itself back up and started ticking again . I was sorry school was about to end for the year , that this was my last week with someplace to go . Walking up Indiana Avenue where all the shops were , on my  | way back from school , I turned down Forty-ninth , thinking I 'd go over to the Forty-ninth Street beach instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days we ever had in Chicago . Later , M'Dear read in the paper that people were dying of heatstrokes that summer . I did n't know anything about that , I just knew I was hot and did n't feel like going home . So I turned down Fortyninth and headed toward the beach , about a mile away . On the street , people was sitting out on their stoops playing cards and music , mostly Leadbelly wailing like a cat caught on a roof at night , and of course Muddy Waters . Walking along that street I could smell dinner drifting out through their screen doors ; cabbage , which made me sick , and liver and onions , one of my favorites . I started thinking about M'Dear 's dinners , that when she came home from work around four there 'd be something good to eat . Forty-ninth Street was solid tenements , just door after door , as far down the block as you could see . Then there was a stoplight at the corner and the tenements went on up the next block @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Right on the sidewalk was a row of basement windows that marched on up the street . Those windows would be people 's only light . A man was sticking his head out his basement window , talking to an older man squatting on the sidewalk . I saw him just as I was fixing to walk by , his head right by my feet . He smiled at me really nice , his face friendly . Look like he was about thirty or so . But when I walked by he looked up my dress and said , " Those sure are some pretty panties . " Now that made me mad . That fool thought he was giving me some kind of sneaky compliment . I told him , " You can get yourself a pair just like them at Kresge 's , " and swished right on by him and that old fool he was talking to . The older man laughed and said , " That little girl do n't want none of your candy , Archie . " He got that right . Behind me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nettie Lee , wait up ! " It was Dairy Jones , Big Daddy Walter 's boss 's son , running with his bookbag thrown over his shoulder . His face was red from running , his socks run down into the heels  | of his shoes . He did n't worry about tucking the tail of his shirt into his shorts or pulling up his socks , and I liked that . He impressed me like he had better things to think about than how he looked and how other people was taking him . He said , " Want me to walk you home ? " " What for ? " He looked confounded for a minute ; then he said , " You 're walking through a bad neighborhood . " " I live right up the next block . " I pointed to where my building was . He started walking in the direction I pointed . " I 'm not going home anyway , " I told him . " I 'm going to go see the beach . " He stopped . " Which one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed over my shoulder . He followed my finger with his eyes , then squinted and shook his head . " That 's not a good idea . " I laughed at him . " What you talking about ? " " Going to the Forty-ninth Street beach is not a good idea . " " Who said ? " " My parents . You could get killed over there . " " No , " I said . " You the one could get killed over there . " " Then what 's the point of going ? " He stopped walking and looked at me . " Maybe for you there ai n't no point , but for Nettie Lee Johnson there is a point . " " So lemme walk you home , okay ? " I liked the way he dragged it out : Okaaaaay ? " Okaaaaay . " We turned around in the middle of the sidewalk and headed the other way , down Drexel Avenue . " You ever see The Wizard of Oz ? " he said . " The who of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He liked to talk about movies he saw on the weekend at Loew 's . M'Dear said going to the movies was something white people like to do . I thought I might like it too , but I did n't want her to accuse me of trying to act white .  | " The Wizard of Oz . In the middle of the movie , Dorothy and the straw man start out walking to Oz . First they go one way , down this yellow brick road , then they turn in the middle of a step , just when they 're ready to put their feet down , and they go in the opposite direction . Like we just did . Almost . The difference is they do it at exactly the same time . " " So ? " " So we could do that . Walk in perfect step , then switch around and walk in perfect step the other way . " " Boy , you crazy ! Why we want to do something like that ? And if we did do it , which one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't a queer ! " " Then you made out of straw . " He looked disgusted . " Forget it . " " Forgot it . " We kept walking , passing by the businesses on Drexel . He edged me with his shoulder . " Boy , what you pushing for ? Quit . " " Go down there . Let 's go that way . " " I do n't want to walk down no alley . Get my shoes dirty . " " It 's a shortcut to your street . You act just like a girl . All they think about is , ' I might get my shoes dirty . I might muss my hair . ' " " I know how to get to my own street . And my hair do n't get ' muss . ' Or ai n't you noticed ? " " Wait a minute . " He stopped and put down his bookbag . " Let me feel it . " I thought about how his hands would feel in my hair . Nobody ever touched me like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He was standing close enough for me to smell his clothes : smelled like green beans cooked in bacon grease and spilled milk . Looking at his face I got scared , worried to death that he might try to kiss me out on Drexel Avenue in front of all them people . I pushed his hand away . " Do n't be touching me , boy . " I thought of what M'Dear would  | say if she caught me and him in the street touching each other . " You got filthy hands anyway , probably been playing with your thing . " Dairy 's mouth opened . " Do n't talk like that , Nettie Lee . Nice girls are n't supposed to say that kind of thing . " " Who said I 'm nice ? " I started down the alley . At least down there nobody would see me with Dairy Jones . He turned and followed me . " If you 're not a nice girl , I bet you done some things , like let boys into your panties . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up at the end and quivering on " panties . " " I do n't have to tell you what I done . It 's my private business . " We were coming up on the back door of the church . Three doors down was the bar Big Daddy Walter went to all the time , the Ace of Clubs . I kept walking up the alley , but I was scared . I had a yearning to find out what he was like , what any boy touching me was like . The other boys in my class did n't bother with me too much . I think they were scared of me , to tell you the truth . Then again , the thought of Dairy touching me , any boy touching me , was repulsive . The door to the bar peeked open a little and a lady in a tight red chemise strutted out . Her dress had wide straps and a row of tassels hanging across her breasts . On top of her bare chest she had a long rope of pearls . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told you , Big Daddy ! I done told you I want a ring to prove your love . Talk is very , very cheap . " Daddy Walter rushed up behind her and grabbed her arm . " Aw , baby , " he said . " Did n't I tell you I already bought the ring ? Got it in layaway over to the jewelry place on Michigan . " She strutted her tail on up the alley . I thought he looked my way for a minute before he hurried after her . I saw them get in his Buick , parked behind the butcher 's . " That 's your daddy , " Dairy said , like I ai n't got eyes . " I know it . " " Who 's he talking to ? That ai n't your mama . " 130 LINDA RAYMOND Rocking the Babies 131  | " Shut up . " Dairy put his bookbag down in the gravel . " Only thing shut me up is a kiss . " He pushed his lips against mine so hard I felt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose smashed up against mine . I could n't breathe . I knew right then and there why that woman told Daddy Walter he better give her a ring for all her trouble . I decided I was n't going to give nothing away either . Every time somebody put their hands on me , I was going to come away with something . Dairy had his eyes squeezed shut and was pushing me so hard I leaned backward and stumbled over my own shoes , and we fell on the ground . But he did n't stop pressing his mouth on mine and trying to push his hands under my dress . I squeezed my legs shut so his hand would n't find my coochie . I just was n't ready for him to be forcing himself on me . Now if he had asked , that might have been a different story . I could n't breathe and the rocks in the alley was pressing into my butt , so I got sick of being underneath him , and I pushed him off . " What 's wrong ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Oh . " I looked up , the-alle-y , toward the bar . " Let 's go . " He seemed relieved , like he did n't have plans on what to do next anyway . " Okay . " I heard a car start up , and then I saw the Buick move off down the alley . Big Daddy Walter was sitting on the front stoop waiting for me when I got home . He sat on the top step with his legs splayed open , his shoulder against the iron rail . I concentrated on the top of his bald head while I squeezed past him . I thought , If he says anything to me , I 'll just turn around and run as fast as I can . Just take off down the street and fly  --  he 's so drunk he could n't catch up with me nohow . My leg hit his shoulder while I was trying to turn the doorknob , and he grabbed me around the ankle . I shook his hand off and ran into the living room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fatback . A whole row of bean cans sat on the counter with their tops open in a little salute . She said , " Hello , what took you so long coming home from school ? " She slid a pan of cornbread batter in the oven . I turned toward the door . Daddy Walter swayed in the doorway , a mean look on his face , but something more was there . He looked scared . " Nettie Lee , " he told me , " go on to the bedroom and do that homework you so crazy about . " He looked at me so intense it was like he was praying to me . " Why , Daddy Walter ? " " I said go . Do n't want to start no arguments with me today . I ai n't but two minutes off of your behind . You ai n't as grown as you think you is . " " What 'd I do ? Besides , I ai n't got no homework today . I did it all at school during recess . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then . " That was something I did not want to hear . All of us children slept in that room . Acie , Too Much , Brawley , Egg , the girls , and me . M'Dear had two beds and a mattress on the floor crammed into that room . The boys was about as bad as you can get about not picking up their clothes and hiding food under the beds . Last thing I wanted to do was go in there and pick up their mess . " Daddy Walter , that room a mess and it 's not my fault . I 'm not going to clean up something that a bunch of slobs made . " He took a step toward me , his face pleading with me to get in my room . " I told you to get that sassy little black behind of yours into that pigsty you sleep in and clean it up . Now . " " Big Daddy , " M'Dear said in her nice voice , " do n't be getting mad at the child . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a look . " She going right in . You go on outside and get yourself some air . I 'll call you when your dinner 's ready . " She looked at me and jerked her head toward the bedroom . " Naw , I ai n't going outside . " He jerked his arm from M'Dear 's hand . " And do n't be using that voice on me . I ai n't no public aid lady listening to no lies you telling . "  | I was trying to figure out what was going on . Daddy Walter was drunk , but that did n't account for all this kind of loud talk-ing . Daddy Walter caught me by the head and pulled me over to him . He pushed his mouth into my ear and said , " Keep your mouth shut . " After a little pause he said , looking right into my face , " Okay , Nettie Lee ? Can you do that for Daddy ? " " Your breath stink , smell like you been kissing some stinky old lady who drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that . I knew he would slap me silly . His face turned so mad I thought he was going to drool at the mouth . He put both his hands around my neck and squeezed till I could n't breathe . I knew he would n't choke me for real . He would n't do such a thing . But I was getting dizzy waiting for him to stop . " Damn , Walter , let loose of that child ! " M'Dear grabbed Daddy Walter by his arm . He did n't answer her , just kept on grunting and trying to strangle me . I guess when you 're drunk it takes some of the strength out of your hands . Still , those hands felt like cats ' claws digging into my neck , giving me the worst headache I ever had . In back of me I could hear M'Dear screaming , " Walter ! Walter ! Do n't kill that child ! " I wanted to tell her this was none of her business , this was between Big Daddy Walter and me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , I would n't mind . He 'd get in trouble , not me , and boy , would that be worth it to see Big Daddy Walter get his . The more he choked me , the more I thought it . Let him kill me . It would serve him right . I heard thong , thong , thong ! and I knew the bells was ringing for me up in heaven , that I done passed over to the other side . Then I hit the floor , and it woke me up right quick . M'Dear was standing over Daddy Walter with her big bean pot held over her head with both hands ; she was bringing it up again smack over his head , until she saw he was passed out from the first blows . She dropped the pot on the floor and grabbed me by my hands . I looked into her eyes , as serious and scared as I had ever seen them .  | " We got to leave here quick before that son-of-a-bitch wakes hisself up , " she told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of them to run to the Buick , do n't worry about taking no clothes or nothing , just get in the car quick . She told Brawley to drive us out of Chicago . She do n't care where , he just supposed to get the Buick on the road and keep going till we somewhere else . Then she changed her mind and said , " Brawley , head this car Down Home where we belong . " And that 's how we ended up in Dayton . That 's all the gas the car had in it . " Your family trips a lot , " Shavonne said to Nettie Lee . " I could n't handle a family like that . " Nettie Lee did n't feel like replying . " Do you miss Chicago , miss where you grew up ? " LaRone asked . " Naw , I do n't miss that place . " Sadness pushed up her throat , followed by a short little laugh . " I sure do n't miss that time in my life . But you know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got rid of Big Daddy Walter , I never saw him again . Mean as he was , I do miss my daddy . " " So when your mama had enough of your daddy telling her what to do , she told the fool to step ? " Shavonne said . " Yeah . Something like that . " " Sometimes people are crying out for help . They do n't even know it themselves , " Martha said . " They hide what 's wrong with them so nobody could help if they wanted to . " " Yeah , maybe that 's true . " Shavonne said , " Do n't your story have some kind of a moral or a point to it ? " " There 's no explaining human behavior , honey . You just look at it . " Nettie Lee continued rocking Gonsalves , who had fallen asleep .  | Martha sat across the conference table from Nettie Lee on a dreary Thursday morning . It was Christmas Eve . Everyone was assembled for Report : Barb Hunter and Terese Czajwolski ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nurse who had instructed her on her first day  --  she had n't seen him since then ; Dr. Ethel Xiang , the neonatology resident ; Nettie Lee ; and Debbie Foxx 's empty chair . Barb Hunter shuffled through a stack of legal-sized papers . The smell of coffee and chocolate steamed from a take-out Lava Java cup set beside her smart black briefcase  --  a graduation present , Martha assumed . Through the open door , Martha could see Foxx scuttling around the nursery , giving quick instructions to the other first-shift nurses , who had already taken over the duties from the night shift . Sitting in rockers and holding their babies , Mrs. Baker and LaRone Cruz , who had come to the unit more in the past week than she had during Daquille 's entire hospitalization , fed their babies and talked . Perhaps LaRone finally realized she would be the sole caretaker for her baby in a week or so , and she wanted to get used to him before she took him home . She cradled him in her arms , her finger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we start the meeting now ? " Dr. Xiang looked impa-tiently at the nurses , folded her hands on the table . " Nurse Foxx may catch up with us when she arrives . " " I 've arrived , " Foxx said , closing the door . She sat down . Dr. Xiang nodded to Barb Hunter . " I believe you have some information about our mystery Baby Doe ? " " That 's right , " Hunter said . " But first I 'd like to hear an update on the baby 's medical condition . " Dr. Xiang pulled a metal-cased patient file from the stack in front of her and read from it . " Baby is suffering from transposition of the great vessels and subsequent heart failure , as you know . The corrective surgery performed last Saturday was successful ; the prognosis is , of course , guarded . Her condition is crit-ical . " She flipped through the thick chart . " Bloodwork is looking as expected  --  blood gases fair , moderate hypovolemia , moderate pulmonary hypertension , high bilirubin , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I will order an exchange transfusion . " She looked briefly around the table , her expression grave . " I examined her this morning to check her skin color . Definitely more jaundiced than yesterday . Baby was born with a positive tox to cocaine and is receiving the appropriate drugs . " III There were murmurs around the table . " How is the drug treatment coming ? " Hunter asked . " Of course , we ca n't really treat cocaine addiction . All we can do is tranquilize Baby to moderate the manifestations of the addiction : increased tone , crying and jitteriness , staring , scissoring of the legs , that type of thing . But Baby seems stabilized . No further episodes of seizures since Tuesday , when I upped the meds . " Dr. Xiang took off her glasses and rubbed both eyes . " That was Tuesday , Foxx ? " " That was Wednesday , Doctor , " she replied , then looked across the table to Barb Hunter . " Wednesday the baby had a mild seizure . Her right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seizure meds . " Martha remembered what had happened . She had just finished wiping off the warming tray and looked at Faith . Her chest rose  | rhythmically with the respirator breaths ; her arms , raised above her head in a seeming gesture of mock surprise , and her legs , sprawled apart , twitched randomly . She was sleeping as peacefully as Martha had ever seen . But then her right foot began trembling in a finely tuned vibration that Martha had almost missed . She had stared at the baby 's leg , watching the trembles travel upward to affect her hand ; then her eyelid danced briefly . Foxx had come over to the warming tray and stood beside her . " What 's wrong , Martha ? " She looked at the baby . " My God , that 's all you need , you poor little girl . " To Martha , she had said , " She 's got the shakes . " Foxx picked up the chart and clicked her pen . " This is why your mother tells you not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Xiang , " The meds are controlling the seizures for the most part . But occasionally one breaks through . " " Perhaps I will order an increase . Trial and error . " " Well , " said Hunter , " I 'm wondering what you think the ba-by 's chances for survival are , Dr. Xiang . " " Baby 's condition is as expected . But percentagewise I would say the odds are not on Baby 's side . " " Oh , Lord have mercy . " Dr. Xiang looked briefly at Nettie Lee , who looked terrible , stricken . Barb Hunter went on as if she had n't noticed Nettie Lee 's prayer . " My office is ready to go forward with charges against the mother , " Hunter said . " The DA is looking for attempted murder since the child was abandoned in a portable toilet , and after talking with him I 'm all for it . I mean , when is this ridiculousness going to stop ? But CPA wo n't go for it . All my office hopes for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so premature and was found still attached to the placenta , we could probably do delivering drugs to a minor . " " I think you 'll have a rough time on that one , " Terese Czajwolski said . " It 's been tried before , and the judge decided that even though a pregnant mother can addict her baby in utero , the fetus is not legally considered a baby . And that 's the law . You ca n't prosecute . "  | " I realize that . I read the cases , " Hunter said . But the difference this time is , the prosecutor wants to go on the fact that after a baby has been delivered , but before the umbilical cord is cut , the mother still pumps cocaine to the baby through the cord . In this case especially , since we found the baby still attached to the placenta , the prosecutor feels there was no effort made to protect the newly born child from the cocaine ingested by the mother . " George Johns sighed impatiently . " You have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cross the placenta , yes ? You would have to prove a young girl has an understanding of anatomy and physiology , of pharmacology . " " Not really , " Hunter said . " And who says it 's a young girl ? " " Who else could be so foolish ? " replied Mr. Johns . " We 're not talking about foolish , " Hunter said . " Leaving your car in the rain with the top down is foolish . Leaving a baby to die is murder . But actually , George , if you read the literature , you 'd know the majority of these babies are born to women with more than one child . They are not young girls . " Mary Pangalangan nodded . " It 's very cruel . They should know better . " " It 's cruel , and it 's becoming more common , " said Callie Hart . " I ca n't believe this is the second time it 's happened in the last couple of years . And it 's not even summer . Leaving a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Well , maybe that 's why the mother called nine-one-one right away , " Mary said . " It 's too cruel . " " Do you think they 'll be able to find that mother ? " asked Nettie Lee . " We have some information , " Hunter said . " The call in to nine-eleven reporting the baby 's location was made by a female who sounded black . It was pretty typical . " " What do you mean , typical ' ? " Nettie Lee crossed her arms , lifted her head . " Typical situation . I mean , I was n't surprised when I heard it . Black female , sounded high as hell , calling from a pay phone , cry-  | ing . Incoherent , almost . And when the baby arrived at the hospital , they got a positive tox screen on her . " " And that 's typical ? " " Well , what I mean is , the crack problem is pretty much confined to that area of town . Let 's just be honest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severe drug use takes place . Following that use is a multitude of problems : child abuse and neglect , criminal activity , poverty , homelessness . " " Some of every evil , is that right ? " George Johns said . " Yes , basically . And I 'm not ashamed to say it . It 's a fact . And it 's horrible . I get so tired of people behaving like animals . " " Well , " said Foxx , " I really do n't think prosecuting a mother who obviously needs psychiatric and substance abuse help is going to accomplish much . And how do you expect addicted pregnant mothers to go for prenatal care when they 're worried about being thrown in jail ? " " Then you would n't do anything to stop these people from throwing their babies away ? " the social worker said . " That seems callous , Debbie . Where 's your heart ? " " I guess I left it in the nursery . " Debbie got up and walked out . The table was uncomfortably silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foxx talk briefly to one of the nurses who had stayed in the nursery during Report ; then Foxx went to the phone . " Well , " Hunter said , a bit sarcastically , Martha thought , " let 's go on . Of course the baby 's condition is n't stable yet , but barring an extraordinary turn of events , I expect that she too will recover and need a foster placement . Martha " ? she looked right at her for the first time ? " I am prepared to set up a home visit for you , if you 're still interested . We can talk about it after Report . " Martha 's heart jumped . " That sounds fine . " " Now for Baby Gonsalves . His mother was contacted and her position is , basically , that she does n't want to see him and wants him signed over to adoption services . If they ca n't get a placement there , I suppose we 'll try for a long-term foster placement . "  | Martha let Hunter 's talk drift past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become Faith 's foster mother . For the first time since Paul died , her heart really lifted . LaRone Cruz had been at the hospital all morning . Martha watched her bathe and feed Daquille . A little before four , her friend Shavonne came in to meet her . Shavonne said they were just going to see a movie , though she had tried to talk LaRone into going to a club with her that evening . LaRone said she was too tired . Now , in the late afternoon , LaRone sat rocking her baby , listening to the grandmothers talk . Shavonne sat in a rocker beside her , anxious to leave . " I think I 'll adopt that little Baby Doe myself , " Martha said . " I know they 'll have a hard time finding a home willing to take in a crack baby , and I 'll already have her as a foster child . " Nettie Lee blew air through her teeth . " Do n't count your chicks before they hatch . " She stopped rocking and looked at Martha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take those babies in . I thought you said money did n't interest you . Guess you say anything that suits you at the time . Being a foster is a paid job , just like anything else . " " I do n't think anybody 's getting rich being a foster mother , " Martha said carefully . She did n't understand Nettie Lee 's anger but had seen it pop up so often when the baby was mentioned that she was n't surprised . " They use that money to feed and clothe the kids . " " Some of them do . Then again , some of them do n't . " " You 're too cynical , Nettie Lee . " She paused . It vas the first time Martha had said her name . She looked at Nettie Lee to see if she had noticed . Nettie Lee rocked Gonsalves back and forth , with fury . " What 's the matter with you ? You 've been touchy since the meeting . Though I ca n't say I blame you . " " Ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebody hard and cynical , then talk about that Miss Hunter . I never  | seen somebody who wanted to throw a mother in jail as bad as that woman does . " " Do n't you think Baby Doe 's mother deserves it ? That 's what you said before . " " Well , I do n't think she deserves what they 've got planned for her . I do n't think she had murder on her mind when she left the baby behind . The girl was probably high or something , like the social worker said , and did n't know what she was doing . " " That 's no excuse . " " I 'm not trying to excuse her . I think what she did is against God 's law . But He will judge her . It 's not up to us . " " I was getting angry at that Hunter girl myself , " Martha said . LaRone said , " Who are you-all talking about ? " " Oh , just a smart young lady from the Child Protection Agency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What they talked about in Report was confidential . " What did she do ? " " She 's in charge of Baby Doe , that 's all , " Martha said . " The one they call Baby X ? Well , that mother better look out for her , " LaRone said . " You do n't want to play with a woman who 's got helping poor folks on her mind . " " What did you hear about Baby X ? " Nettie Lee asked casually . Martha thought she sounded too casual . Nettie Lee took a sudden interest in folding down the hand cuffs on Gonsalves 's shirt , covering his fingers . " I 've been hearing about her for the past month . You ca n't turn on the TV without seeing somebody talk about it . " " What do you think is wrong with the mother ? " Martha asked . " The way she just disappeared ? " She shook her head . If it were her , she would miss the baby so much she could n't possibly stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get her baby back ? " " I do n't really think about it , " LaRone said . " I mean , how do I know what she was feeling ? How can I judge ? I 'm just happy I 've never been that desperate . " " Maybe she had post-delivery depression , " Shavonne said .  | " You heard of that ? Where the mother goes crazy and thinks her baby is the devil or something ? I saw that on Oprah . " Martha said , " It 's not just being desperate that has me wored . It 's being misunderstood . I think Miss Hunter looks at people and she sees the pictures , the explanations , already in her mind , and she does n't see what stands right in front of her . That 's what worries me . " " You know what else I saw one time ? " Shavonne said . " They had this woman on who did n't even know she was pregnant . So she has labor pains , right ? And she thinks she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to the hospital and the baby plops out of her , right there in the cab . When she was feeling it , all she thought was she had to go to the bathroom . " " That 's pretty dumb . " LaRone looked unimpressed . " Then another time , they had a show with this girl who looked like she was about twelve or something , I do n't remember how old she said she was . Well , this girl lived with her grandmother , who was real strict and made the girl go to church all the time , and everything like that ? So this girl turns up pregnant anyway , and she hides it from her grandmother by wearing big old shirts and staying in her room a lot , so her grandmother wo n't notice anything . Then she has the baby one night in her room , while her grandmother is asleep . She wraps it up in a bunch of towels and puts it in the toy chest so nobody can find it . Only , her grandmother is cleaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in there dead . So the girl claims she did n't know the baby was in there . Then they get a psychiatrist to examine her , and he says she had that same kind of post-delivery thing that the girl on Oprah had . I do n't remember what show this one was . It could have been Montel . " " Oh , for Christ 's sake , " Martha said , feeling curiosity and disgust . " That garbage is going to rot your mind . " " It really did happen , " Shavonne said . " Do n't you want to know what 's going on in the world ? Unless you 're just like that grandmother , who thought making that girl go to church all the time was all she needed to do . "  | " Well , " Nettie Lee said , " it 's a fact you ca n't control your children these days . Do n't seem to matter how hard you try . They go on out and do as they please and let the devil take the hindmost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that and you 're just living in denial . " " Yes , " Martha said . " People need to face up to what they know is the truth . " " Like who ? " Nettie Lee said quickly . " Anyone . I was just talking in general . But if you want to get specific , I know about a man who was the king of denial . He was one of my relatives . " " Where your people from ? " Nettie Lee asked . " Oh , we come from a long way , over in West Virginia , " Martha said . " And before that , North Carolina . " She closed her eyes and leaned her face against Brown 's back and shoulder , nuzzling the warm , loose skin on the baby 's back , grazing the fine hairs on the baby 's shoulder with the tips of her fingers before tightening the blankets to keep her warm . Brown stirred and squeaked , then opened her eyes . Large and dark , they gave her face a worried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Moved here . Took the bus . " " Girl , talking to you is like walking down a brick road in the middle of January  --  got to do it one brick at a time . You afraid I'ma sell your story to the Enquirer ? " " I 'm not studying about you . " " Because you ai n't got nothing to be ashamed of . Or especially proud of . Far as I can tell , you the average woman . Got a average life . You not going to wake up some bright morning and find out you married to Donald Trump , so you do n't have to worry over your image like you been doing . " " What are you mumbling about ? " Martha rubbed her cheek against the baby 's coarse blanket . " Your airs . You got too many , " Nettie Lee said . " Now do n't get me wrong . A few high-flung notions is a good thing . You know , give the world something good to chew on about you . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say ? " " You 're just saying too much . Leave me alone . I changed my mind . I do n't feel like discussing my private business today . " " You ashamed of your people , " Nettie Lee said simply , then bent her face down to Gonsalves , humming the theme song from The Walton . Could that be true ? Martha 's mind flew off in a race of worry . She loved her mother but had felt sorry for her , and as a child she had wanted to protect her . She 'd walked behind her , throughout the house , watching her hips hump beneath her dress , wanting to be her mother 's second voice , loud as a bullhorn . She 'd tell her father why Mama used sweet potatoes in the pot roast that time , instead of the carrots he was expecting : None of your business ! Next time make dinner yourself ! She thought of her big brother , Michael , angry and dusty and bloody . And then her father 's rage , likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could she do about a grown man 's tears ? Ashamed of her people ? Her grandmother Adele , a tiny-boned woman with a white frizz of hair around her face , lying in a coffin . She 'd seemed like a giant when she was alive . When Martha heard the story of David and Goliath in Sunday school , she had imagined David was Grandma Adele and Goliath a strong black man with her father 's face . She knew Grandma could pick up a slingshot and pitch a rock hard enough , far enough , to knock Goliath down . Her mama was the oldest , Uncle Chillie the baby . There were six other children between them . Back when Martha was growing up , Uncle Chillie was a grown man with a job at the air force base . Once , Martha came into the front room of Grandma Adele 's house and found Uncle Chillie lying with his head cradled in her lap , his legs hanging over the rolled arm of the couch , the tips of his shoes grazing the carpet . Grandma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ai n't no Ivana Trump . " She laughed and shook her head . " Ivana ai n't got to use no Vaseline on her head . " Martha stopped rocking . " I do n't use Vaseline , old woman . " " You grease your head up like anybody else got nappy hair .  | most touching his , and dabbed at his eye with a twisted bit of toilet paper . She had said , " Chillie 's got an eyelash up under his lid . " She held his lashes between her fingers and turned the lid inside out . Even so , Uncle Chillie lay still , his arms drooped over the couch , his hand resting palm up on the floor . Her people : they were unpredictable , rough . Was she ashamed of them ? Martha watched Nettie Lee bending over Gonsalves , swaddling him tighter in his blanket . " My people came from North Kenova , West Virginia . And before that , for five generations back , from North Carolina . My first relative , born a slave but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moses . " " We talking about after the Emancipation ? " " She was born before the Civil War even started . " " Then how come she was n't a slave ? And who was this king of denial you talking about ? " My **29;155;TOOLONG , Armella Sykes Moses , was born on a big tobacco plantation in North Carolina sometime in the late 1830s . I do n't have any pictures of Armella , but in my mind her face is clear as the moon at night . Her nose was broken so badly it lay flat to one side . Her daddy was an Indian brave who took up with black folks . They say the Indian in her made her willful , disinclined to take orders , and along the way she got her nose smashed for it . But I do n't believe in that kind of stereotyping . I think she was strong because she had to be . No such thing as a weak slave . She could plow up a field good as any man . When she planted her big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl from whatever she was trying to haul . Sykes ran a big plantation , more than three thousand acres planted mostly to tobacco , but he grew cotton too . To work the place , he had over three hundred slaves doing all kinds of jobs , from cooking to valeting to working as carpenters , seamstresses ,  | and blacksmiths ; some were also singers and poets . All that the plantation needed , they provided . Armella lived there with her brother Geoffrey . She remembered three things about the Sykes plantation . The first was Christmas dinner , when Sykes would have the men clear out the tool barn to make room for thirty or so long tables groaning with food . The women spent the week before Christmas cooking in the Big House kitchen . While they cooked , they used to sing a song that went : Christmas for the master The food laid out so neat . Darkies cooking dinner For the master 's treat . New Year 's Day is coming . Together we shall rest . Cooking for the master ? Cook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fireplace that took up one whole wall , with cast-iron pots hanging at the sides , kept sparkling clean by old Granny Ivory . That was her job , to cook for the Sykes family . None of the cooking for the slaves took place in the Big House kitchen . Instead , Sykes had a separate building where the chil-dren 's cook kept a fire going , cooking up cornbread and roasting potatoes . Pa Joe 's job was to watch the children while their parents were in the fields . He helped the cook dump cornbread and buttermilk into a trough that stretched across the whole front of the kitchen building , for the young ones to eat breakfast and lunch . Most of the time they got just enough to keep the gripe out of their stomachs , but on Christmas there was food and more food . Plenty of roasted turkeys , of course , and hams , roasted chickens , and sometimes deer meat , though Armella did n't care for that . She and Geoffrey lived with Granny Ivory , who baked  | pies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sticky on top with brown sugar . She made plenty of desserts all by herself , but some of the women would get a contest going to see who could make the best sweet-potato pie , get the sweetest grape juice , the lightest biscuits . They let the men judge . They cooked up all the usual winter vegetables too , turnips and carrots and dried corn soaked in milk . Out in the barn , they had the braziers heaped with hot coals . When all the people gathered together , they made their own warmth . After dinner , they lined up at the back door of the Big House while Sykes handed out the Christmas treats . The men got a plug of tobacco to keep for themselves . Sykes said the slaves grew it , so they ought to get a little piece of it . The women got a length of cloth to make a new dress , and the children got a bit of rock candy to suck . They had their dancing and singing all the rest of the week until New Year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work . The second thing Armella remembered from the Sykes place was Peggy Dear . She lived in the cabin next to Granny Ivory . Peggy Dear did n't have a husband but she had four light-skinned children , all of them too little to work . When Armella turned twelve , Peggy Dear had another baby , just as light as can be . Everybody knew those were Sykes 's children , but nobody said anything in front of Peggy Dear , since she felt humiliated as it was , though she loved her children the same as anybody else . But with this baby , the burden was too great . She lost her mind . Try as she might , Granny Ivory could n't get her to nurse the child . Pretty soon , Peggy Dear ran off without confiding to anybody what she was planning , and she did n't take her children , not even the newborn . Granny took up all the kids into her cabin , the same as she did for Armella and Geoffrey when they arrived without a mother . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put Peggy Dear 's children back in their own cabin , just across the way , and put Armella in charge of them , like a little mother . Around a week after Peggy Dear was still missing , Armella was sitting out in the yard with Granny Ivory , shelling peas for the  | Sykeses ' dinner , the baby sleeping in a wood box next to Armella 's feet . She looked up the road , and here comes one of Mr. Sykes 's tobacco wagons rolling down to the cabins . All of Peggy Dear 's children were sitting in the dirt , making mudpies , watching the wagon come . Granny Ivory got up slowly , her eyes on the wagon still off a ways yet , and she turned to Armella and told her , " Take those children inside and close the door . Do n't you let me see that you- done gone and opened that door , not even a peep . " Armella got them into Peggy Dear 's cabin , but as soon as Granny Ivory turned her back , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the driver  --  a big strong man  --  pull Peggy Dear out of the wagon , her dress front torn down to her waist , her bare chest as bloody as could be and flat as a child 's . Her mouth was torn , her earlobes were gone , and her legs were bloody . He carried her into Granny Ivory 's cabin , her body drooping out of his arms , and Granny Ivory shut the door after him . Armella helped nurse Peggy Dear , helped wrap her bloody chest with a larded cloth , helped clean off her face , her ears . Granny Ivory washed carefully between Peggy Dear 's legs , though Granny would n't let Armella see what she was doing under the covers , what produced so many bloody rags for her to bury . Armella fed Peggy Dear broth until she got her strength back , then she went home and took up being her children 's mother again . Granny Ivory never explained to Armella what had happened . The wagon driver 's wife told everybody that after Peggy Dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out after her . They sniffed her out , found her hiding in a ramshackle hovel some nasty people had abandoned . She was lying unconscious on the dirt floor , rats crawling all over the poor woman , eating off her delicate parts . The overseer sicced the dogs on her . They began to cry , scrambling over each other to get to her , and the rats just flew off . The driver told his wife he thought the overseer was slow to beat those dogs off Peggy Dear , but Armella said the dogs saved Peggy Dear 's life , in a way . They saved her from being eaten by rats .  | The last thing Armella remembered was when she was thirteen , Granny Ivory called her over and said , " Go on up to the Big House and see what 's up there . " Granny looked like she 'd been crying , but she did n't say anything about why . She just stood nodding her head up and down , over and over , as if it were broken . Armella @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tobacco wagon , his legs swinging off the back . Sykes , standing beside the driver , told her to get in too , told her the man driving the wagon was Smith , their new master . The man was younglooking , his hair reddish , tattered . A puny look hung around his shoulders . He did n't say anything , just started up the horses as soon as Armella sat . They rode until the Sykes place disappeared and there was just tobacco fields for miles . For hours they rolled along , Armella next to Geoffrey , neither settled enough to speak . Their hands were n't tied , their legs were free , and the wagon hobbled ; they could have jumped off the back and run . But it never entered little Armella 's head to do such a thing , though she did notice that if she extended her foot down a little bit , she could drag her toe on the dusty road . The wagon jerked along until darkness fell . Through the dark , Armella thought she recognized a stand of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was n't sure . Not too much later , Smith turned the wagon onto a rutty road that traveled up to a small house on a rise , and down to a cabin , which lay in a depression fronted by a stand of trees . They swayed down the road and along a field to the cabin , which smelled of fresh-cut pine boarding . The wagon rolled to a stop and shook as Smith hopped off . He stood before them in the moonlight , pale , one-sided as a paper doll , the cabin posed darkly behind him . Armella knew she and Geoffrey were supposed to get out of the wagon ; they were , after all , slaves . Their obligation was to do anything the man wanted . But they sat , until Smith told them to hurry up and slide on down ; they were at their new home . What you get used to feels like what always was . Armella got used to the farm . It was dangerously small ; she and Geoffrey were the only slaves on it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Occasionally , Miz Smith did too , though she spent most of her time in the modest Big House . Miz Smith was a bigboned , dark-haired woman , not pretty , not even handsome , but impressively , commandingly , feminine . On this little farm , Miz . Smith did n't have household help . Smith claimed he could n't spare Armella from the fields but one day a week to work in the Big House . Unlike her husband , Miz Smith had a natural proprietary gaze ; whatever she looked at suddenly seemed owned . Armella followed Miz Smith 's eyes around the house , jumping when they came to rest on her . The house had pine floors . A mistake , Miz Smith said ; the wood was too soft to last . The little furniture they had sprinkled around the house was made of dark waxed wood and brocade and looked old and handed down , maybe from Miz Smith 's family in Virginia . Miz Smith was tight-fisted . She knew how to squeeze money until it bled . Her daddy gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep control of it herself , given the Smith family history with money . She kept the whole bundle buried in the yard on the south corner of the house , underneath a cape jasmine vine that crawled up the chimney flue . She was scared about that little bit of money , terrified somebody wanted to take it from her . Alone , she tumbled an onerous boulder over the spot to hide it . Armella and Geoffrey knew all about the money , but they did n't touch it . What would they do with money ? Anytime Smith wanted some of that money , even if it was to buy Miz Smith something ( he was always having to give her peace offer-ings ) , she made him dress up in his clean clothes and apply , the way you would to a bank . Some years their small cotton and tobacco crop got them by , but some years it did n't . Smith thought of himself as an imitation Thomas Jefferson  --  inventor , grand estate owner . In his mind , things were always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of his eyes simply did n't count . The special cash crops Smith dreamed up always cost them money . But they did n't suffer . They ate out of their garden patch all year , whether the food was fresh or put up . Wild hog meat usually hung in the Smiths '  | When Smith came to visit Armella down in the cabin , she would n't let him lie down on her real bed . She kept her slave duties and her womanhood separate . The difference between her real bed and the one she used with Smith was , for one thing , her real bed was stuffed with moss , not weeds , and for another thing , her real bed did n't smell like the master 's behind , and she wanted to keep it that way . But Smith thought he was lying on the bed she slept in , and that mattered to him . He was looking for intimacy , possession . She just wanted to get it over with . She 'd back up as he walked in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Geoffrey ? " he 'd want to know . " Out to the barn , tending the milking , " would be her answer . He already knew that . Out in the barn was where Smith told Geoffrey to sleep . When Smith noticed her belly growing , felt his child like a hard stone beneath him , he grew kinder , demanded loving less often . In the fields , he 'd take her hoe , chop the weeds himself . When she got big , he told Armella to lie under the stand of oaks separating the cotton field from the tobacco , to rest . Inside her , the child elbowed and stretched , unhappy , cramped . When she sat , she could track the movements of the child across her belly : a sudden knee jut , or a long rolling wave across her abdomen when he turned , exploring the confines of her womb . When she became weary of his antics , Armella would bend her head to whisper , " I see you 're impatient , but the world is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the time comes . " The baby was late . Geoffrey accused Armella of trying to hold it inside , to protect the child from his fate . Geoffrey placed his hands on her belly , gave her the only advice he could think of . " You better let go of that baby soon , before he knocks his way out . " Knocking his way out was exactly what the birth felt like to Armella . Her pains exhausted her . When Geoffrey held out the baby boy , wrapped in a cotton sheet , his name came to her immediately  --  Amber . He was the clear brown of amber glass .  | Miz Smith refused to attend Armella in labor or have anything to do with her when she found out about the pregnancy . The same night Amber came into the world , Miz Smith sneaked into Armella 's cabin . Geoffrey woke to find her holding a fancy pillow over Armella 's face with one hand , the other hand clamped over the baby 's nose and mouth . He knocked her down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a piece of rope . When morning came , Miz Smith left the master and the farm , raving about how it was killing her to stay there , suffocating her to stay ; she could n't put up with half-human animals living right alongside her . Smith left to hunt her down . He returned her to the house . He bought new furniture he had to send for all the way to New Orleans , and that seemed to quiet Miz Smith for a time . But that fight went on for years  --  Miz Smith leaving , Smith tracking her down , then buying her something to own , to dust , to polish , to keep her attachment to the house . At first , the Emancipation was a rumor . All over the South there were whispers that war was coming . Sometimes the slaves could n't talk about it but gave each other a look that held a moment or two longer , and it felt good . But the way Smith acted had Armella , Amber , and Geoffrey frightened . Smith started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the rifle stock ; he slept with the rifle lying next to him , as if he were its nervous lover . He sat on the porch looking out to the road , the rifle on his knees . Miz Smith got downright nasty with her slaves . Would n't turn her back on them . Made sure her rifle was in plain sight . She told Armella , " If you so much as look me in the face , I 'll snatch you bald-headed , then shoot you dead . " That 's the way things were going with all the rumors flying around . Armella better not turn her eyes toward a newspaper or any little word written down . That would be the end of her . Geoffrey or Amber better not look the Smiths in the eye . They would be hung from a tree , meat flayed off their bones , bodies thrown in the woods for the animals to carry off . Miz Smith told them what was what .  | At night , Armella sneaked to the farmhouse and eased up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's voices drifted out . Lying in the dirt , under the cape jasmine , she heard Miz Smith say , plain as if she were sitting in a chair across from her , " Ai n't nothing to do for it . Nigger lover up in Washington going to set all the niggers free . I hope one comes right in his bedchamber and rapes his wife ! " Miz Smith began to cry . " I hope she feels the degradation white women in the South have been subjected to all these years . And we never cringed from our duty . Why , that Lincoln is more like a soft-hearted woman himself ! Do n't have the sense of a pig mite . Free the niggers , and we all live like they do ! " Miz Smith exhaled loudly . She was carrying on , in a state . When she got like that , her voice screeched . " I am not ready to have niggers in my face without the least bit of control on them ! What will happen to us ? " Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the love of God , Aubrey ! It 's one thing being humane to dumb animals . But we ai n't talking pure animals . The niggers act half human . They ai n't going to appreciate any crying and studying you do over them . They are scheming liars . Stick a knife in your back soon as say , ' Yes , Massa . ' Do n't start feeling soft about them . Especially not Armella . " Armella 's breath caught . Miz Smith went on yelling , her voice like small darts hitting a target , bull's-eye . " If she ever turns out another halfbreed , I 'll kill it soon as I see it . And I 'll kill you too . " More muffled talk . " Oh , go away ! I do n't want to talk about it anymore . Go on outside and make sure those niggers ai n't trying to break in here and cut our throats , while you sit around drinking whiskey . " Right before she left for good , Miz Smith took Armella aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said anything important to her . " Armella , I do n't understand how you can turn against us this way . I nursed you when you were sick . Remember the time you and Geoffrey both came down with pneumonia ? "  | " Yes , ma'am . " She remembered the first winter , lying in her cold cabin , a single wool blanket pulled up to her nose , Geoffrey in the other bed , not yet driven off to sleep in the barn , the fireplace dark , rain outside . Miz Smith blew in on a gust of wind , slammed the door shut , poured a swallow of bitter-tasting elixir down their throats , slammed the door shut again . When old Miz left , both she and Geoffrey prayed out loud . Prayed that pneumonia would be the feather that could float them to heaven . But now they did n't have to die to get their freedom . President Lincoln signed the Proclamation and it was finished . Miz Smith ran off and did n't come back . She dug up her Pal-sy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever have to steal back something that was already yours ? Some precious thing , like a ball or a baby doll ? It was n't worth much to anybody except you , but oh , how you treasured it , how you wrapped your heart around it ! It was n't just a plastic doll anymore , it was your baby . Then a bully gets ahold of it . He steals it and holds it high over your head , your baby in his large ugly hands . Smith decided the Emancipation Proclamation did n't apply to his slaves . He 'd refuse to tell them about it , simple as that . If anybody trespassed onto his farm , white or nigger , he 'd shoot them dead . If any of his slaves tried to leave , he 'd shoot them dead too . Besides , they were happy where they were . He treated them right . He was fond of Armella and his Amber . Owning that boy was like having a son . Somebody to help him break apart the beaver dams in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fields , fill up the smokehouse with hog and rabbit meat . Smith felt old , and the feeling was n't going away . He needed Amber to keep back the loneliness . No . It was impossible for him to tell his slaves about the Emancipation , then watch them walk off . Armella and the others already knew about freedom . They knew more about freedom than a free man . It was a presence and an absence in their lives . The more confined he kept them , the deeper their knowledge of freedom became .  | After Miz Smith was gone , people started leaving the Sykes place , too . They 'd get onto Smith 's property by accident , lost , trying to walk their way north or to other plantations , looking for mothers and wives , sisters and brothers , and children who had been sold away . One old man with four grown children had set off looking for his wife , sold to a speculator ten years before , and got his directions fouled up in the far end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoeing the first weeds of summer . Wiping sweat from his eyes , the old man told Amber about the Yankee soldiers coming to the Sykes plantation a few days before . How the soldiers told them they were free , while old Mr. and Miz Sykes looked on . They had a meeting down in the cabins to plan what to do about the freedom . Some wanted to stay , to help Sykes work his place for pay , but most grabbed their children by the hands and walked . So here he was trying to locate his wife . Did Amber ever know of a Florence Sykes ? Before Amber could answer him , Smith came down from the porch at the Big House , raised his rifle and shot the man where he stood , then turned and went back to the house . They decided they were n't up to a confrontation with Smith . They 'd take the few little things they needed from the cabin and leave in the early morning , way before the sun was ready to come up . They walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmhouse , then out through the cotton field , and finally onto the road . When they 'd gotten as far as the boulder and the cape jasmine vine , its trunk thick as the devil 's walking stick and its leaves crispy brown with neglect , Amber heard a creak on the porch . Smith rose darkly from his sentinel chair , his shadow blacker than the surrounding night . Amber watched him step off the porch , arms raised in the familiar gesture of taking aim . Smith 's " Where y'all going ? " sounded almost pleasant , like a question to pass the time . Armella answered before either of the men could .  | " We going on down the road , Master Smith . Just going on down the road . " " What you doing that for ? " The rifle stock rested high against his shoulder . Amber heard Geoffrey take in a breath . " We know about the Emancipation , " Geoffrey said . " We 're going to take our freedom now . " Smith swung the rifle to Geoffrey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? You want to be free ? I 'll free you from slavery . " He swung the rifle to Amber , raised it high , taking aim at his head . Smith talked slowly , as if he was thinking over every word . " You want to be free . I think I can help you . See , I do n't think a stranger can free my slaves , even if that man is the President of this sad country . No stranger knows what my niggers mean to me , no stranger can take my family away from me . No stranger can free you . " Smith lowered his rifle . " You do want to be free ? " Armella spoke . Her quiet voice spread through the yard . " Yes , Master . That 's what we want . " Smith hefted his rifle to her , steadied it at her head . " Then I 'll free you myself . Like I 'm that salvation ' you 're so fond of singing about . " " Freedom ! " Amber shouted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Amber shouted again , frightened . " That 's something you ca n't provide . You ai n't got the power to give it or take it away . You ai n't got the power to hold on to a slave or free him . Only a man can do that . And you ai n't been a man in a long time . " The rifle swung to Amber . " Amber , hush ! " Armella said . Amber could n't keep silent . " It takes more than what you got between your legs to prove you a man , Smith . Mama told me that , and she 's right . " " All right , Amber , " Armella said . " Stop talking now . Let the master have his say . " " No . I been listening to the master since before I knew I had ears . I been looking at his farm , his cotton , his tobacco . I been lis-  | tening to his ideas , his plans . I got plans too . Did you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I ca n't carry them through , living on this farm with you . I ca n't stay here and be your nigger boy no more . " From the edge of his mind , Amber had a vision of his mother , armed with a stone , poised to strike . He saw Smith swing the rifle to her , saw him aim lower , the rifle like some horrible extension of Smith , his true form , an elephant 's trunk , a bestial deformity that Amber had finally glimpsed . His creep to Smith took an eternity . His breath , a thread , unraveled into the night air and then spooled back . He wanted only for the rifle to remain still until he could quiet its master . Amber circled Smith 's neck with his hands , felt its loose skin beneath the stubble of beard , and broke it quickly . He let Smith sway against him , felt his weight sag into his arms , then let the body slip to the dirt . After Armella , Amber , and Geoffrey walked off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from the Bible , and settled down in Mt . Airy , North Carolina . Armella got work with Miz Eveleen Richmond , who was married to a lawyer . Geoffrey worked as their gardener , and Amber went to a school for colored children through the eighth grade . He moved to Philadelphia and became a merchant , selling whiskey and cloth . He married a woman from Mt . Airy , Pless Higgins , who gave him five children , Mary being one of them . Geoffrey never did get married , and neither did Armella . They lived out their lives in a little house in town , with a small garden patch in back for Geoffrey 's vegetables and flowers . When they got too feeble to do for themselves , Amber moved his family back to Mt . Airy and took Armella and Geoffrey into his own house . Amber Moses turned out to be an odd man . He put all his faith in his business dealings and left his wife , Pless , to herself . He had a habit of shunning his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He said he knew Armella and he knew  | Geoffrey , and that 's as far as he wanted to take it . I think killing his own father addled his mind . Armella would n't talk about slavery days until she got old ; then she could remember some of the things that happened to her , way back then , just as clear as if she had lived them the day before . Armella told my Great-great-grandmother Pless , Pless told my Great-grandmother Mary , Mary told Grandma Adele , Adele told Mama , and now I 'm telling you . " I see what you mean about not living a lie , " Nettie Lee said . " It sure will mess you up . So Smith was your **29;186;TOOLONG ? " " Yes . Mother 's side . " " You think it does you any good to retell them old slaverydays stories ? " Shavonne said . " It just makes me feel mad about the whole mess all over again . " " You think we should forget what happened ? " Martha said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way back that far . If black people want to hold on to the time they was slaves , then white people be holding on to the time they was masters . What kind of sense does that make ? I was n't a slave . I do n't hold a grudge toward nobody . You treat me right , I 'll treat you the same . You do n't treat me right and you got a problem go by the name of Shavonne . But the way I feel about it is this : Forgive and forget . " Martha said , " And the way I feel about it is this : Forget where you came from , and you 're bound to head back to the same place . " Then she added , " People tend to walk in circles . "  | Nettie Lee hated dinnertime . It was n't just fixing the food in her little rundown kitchen , it was eating it in front of the TV with Little Barn and wondering if his baby sister would show up on the set while he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home from the hospital on Christmas Eve she was tired ; her bunions ached . Standing in front of the apartment-sized stove with its four tiny gas burners that could only hold three pots , if she placed them just right , did n't inspire her . She took a package of chicken wings out of the refrigerator . The meat looked pale with fat , was still slightly frozen . She turned on the tap to trickle out lukewarm water , laid the meat in the sink , still wrapped in Styrofoam and plastic . She took the giant bottle of warehouse barbecue sauce out of the refrigerator and set it on the counter , then sat for a moment in the kindergarten chair by the stove . She 'd bought it for Yolanda at a yard sale so many years ago . Now she let Little Barn sit on it to watch her cook , or she 'd stand on it herself to reach up into the high cabinets . Little Barn was in the living room , playing Nintendo and watching Barney . She could hear him switch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " We 'll be right back right after  | these messages ! " Then she 'd hear the mechanical wind-up music from Super Mario Brothers or the deep-throated men 's chorus singing " Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles ! Turtle Power ! " That 's fine , she thought . Let the boy have his fun . He 'd find out quick enough that life was n't like those games . She was glad his daddy bought him all that mess , though at the time she had shaken her head and told him  --  right in front of Little Barn because she was speaking the truth and the truth does n't need to be hidden  --  that a boy needs his father , not a load of guilt toys . Sitting in the chair , she bent low into a cabinet and rummaged through several boxes , finally pulling out the Rice-A-Roni . She wet a paper towel and wiped off a rusty circle on the cast iron skillet , then dug two soup spoons full of margarine out of the little yellow tub and melted them in the skillet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After a few minutes , after the rice turned white and the spaghetti pieces turned brown , she added two cups of water and the contents of the seasoning package , turned the heat down , and covered the skillet with a lid . She sat on the little chair again . She had been awake since three that morning and finally got out of bed at five , when she figured it was no use , sleep was n't going to come ; lying in bed turning over all her problems would n't produce any answers . Tookie was n't getting better . In fact , now that she was having seizures , the doctor acted pessimistic . Nettie Lee overheard Dr. Xiang telling the redheaded nurse that the next few days would determine the baby 's prognosis . She went to the sink and unwrapped the chicken . She began massaging the cold wings between her fingers until the joints loosened and thawed . She put the chicken in a bowl , then ran warm water over her hands to warm them up . If Tookie 's yellow eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would take the blood out of her body and replace it with different blood . Nettie Lee worried maybe Tookie would catch AIDS from the blood . She heard about that happening all the time . But they must test blood for AIDS now , right ? Since they could test people . She arranged the wings on a cookie pan covered with Reynolds  | Wrap and poured barbecue sauce over them , the sharp smell making her hungry for the finished meat . She slid them inside the cold oven , shut the door , turned on the gas . Nettie Lee stared out the kitchen window , counting the bare branches of two intertwined maples in the front yard , their canopy a chaotic outline against the sky . Christmas was the next day , December was coming to a slow close , and a new year waited for her . But she did n't feel up to it . Little Barn sat crossed-legged on the living room floor , three feet from the TV . Nettie Lee sat on the couch behind him , her feet propped up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chicken wings and Rice-A-Roni and two pieces of sliced bread , rested on her thighs . The portable TV they watched sat on top of a console TV that was broken . Little Barn 's chin pointed up to the working screen , his jaws in motion eating the rice . TV light played over his face faintly . " Move on back from that set , Little Barn . I do n't want you getting in the magnetic field . " " What magnet , Grandma ? " Little Barn turned around to look at her , his face open and curious . " Just do n't sit right up on the TV . Move back . Here , come sit by my feet . " He settled by her feet with his back against the couch , but he complained . " I ca n't see , Grandma . The people are too far away . " On the screen , a group of friends who met in a bar every day were scheming to break up the wedding of the bartender and his barmaid girlfriend . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of laughter . " It 's almost time for you to go to bed anyway , " Nettie Lee told him . She wanted to watch the six o'clock news , but she did n't want him in the room . He had to go to bed now , before the news came on . She knew she could n't make it to the eleven o'clock news . She was too tired after a string of long restless nights . She 'd be asleep before nine .  | " It 's not bedtime , " he said . " It 's only dinnertime ! I want to stay up for Santa Claus . " She had forgotten to buy him Christmas presents . " Stop whining . I know what time it is . " She picked up her fork . " Eat your food . " Maybe she could put him to bed , then go out to the toy store . It was n't too late . " I do n't like chicken things . " " Yes , you do . Eat . " She did n't like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let him wake up on Christmas with nothing under the tree . " No , " he insisted . " I do n't like this food . My daddy says you do n't have to eat stuff you do n't like . " " Well then , tell your daddy to get over here and make dinner . " " I do n't know where he is , " Little Barn admitted . " You and everybody else . Now hush up and eat . Let the food stop your mouth . " She would just have to tell Little Barn to get in bed and stay there until she got back . Little Barn picked up a wing carefully , licking the sauce from it , but did n't bite into it . " I hope you do n't call that eating . What you doing do n't put food in your stomach . " " I do n't like the chicken part . It makes my stomach hurt . " He threw the wing onto his plate and turned back to the television , his back pushed furiously against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crying again . Tonight she just was n't up to hearing it . It was really too bad for a boy as sweet as her Little Barn to have to act like such a brat . She knew what was going on . When children do n't get the love they need , they act up enough to get on their parents ' nerves . Nettie Lee tried a different tack . " Your daddy likes chicken wings . " " How do you know ? " He turned around to look at her , his face interested . " ' Cause I seen him eat my chicken wings enough times . They his favorite . "  | Little Barn looked suspicious . " How come I never saw him eat them ? " " What have you seen him eat ? " He was silent for several moments . " Nothing , " he finally said . " I do n't remember . " " Chicken wings are his favorite . " Little Barn bit into one , then chewed in loud smacks meant to keep his taste buds uninvolved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess so , " he said . " They taste kind of good . " He put his plate on the rug . " Grandma , how come you so mad all the time ? " Nettie Lee felt herself suffocating , her chest caving in . If only it were possible to die right then of natural causes , she would n't feel like killing herself . No , she 'd never do that . Little Barn needed her . Tookie needed her . " Boy , pick that plate up off of the floor . What did I tell you about that ? " Her words were slow and half-hearted . " You said the floor ai n't my table . " He put the plate on his knees . " The floor ai n't my closet or my bed neither . " He turned to look at her . His round head needed a good brushing . Good Lord , she guessed she let him go out of the house looking like that , with lint all in his hair . Now here she sat arguing with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You hate me , do n't you ? " he said . " Why you say that ? " Nettie Lee immediately felt her breathing return like a jolt of oxygen . " Look here , you live here , do n't you ? How can I hate you if you living right here with me ? That means I love you . " " Yeah , but Mommy used to live here with you , and you told her you hated her and she had to move out . " " I never said that . " She did n't remember saying it , anyway . Or maybe she did . Sometimes she said things to Yolanda she did n't mean . The last time she had seen Yolanda , the girl was on her way out the door to live with that so-called friend of hers , the one with so many kids she could n't count their daddies . And that apartment they had  --  no furniture except that couch with the  | baby piss and what-all on it , a throw rug , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she lived in this house . " When Mommy comes home with her new baby , we going to find us an apartment where we do n't have to listen to no bitches . " He picked up his plate and began to eat again . " Well , your mommy may have a problem with that if she opens her own mouth . " " What you mean , Grandma ? " " I do n't mean nothing , honey . Eat your Rice-A-Roni . And yeah , I love you . I love you more than tongue can tell . Now do n't ask me that mess no more , you hear ? " " You love Mommy ? " " I said do n't ask me that mess . " Nettie Lee 's stomach flopped in a sudden wave of nausea . " I love your mommy . " " And my daddy ? " Now he was pushing it . " Honey , I ai n't seen your daddy in some time . Your birthday , I guess was it . I ca n't love somebody I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had seen Barn robbing the grocery store over a month ago . Much as she hated his daddy , she could n't hurt Little Barn like that . She got up from the couch . The travel alarm clock on top of the TV said five-thirty . " Give me your plate , then go on in to bed . Put on your pajamas . No , take a bath . Take a bath and then put on your pajamas . " Half an hour later , Little Barn came out of the bathroom in a Dallas Cowboys T-shirt that hung past his knees . He looked like a little girl going to sleep in her nightdress . " Where 'd you find that thing ? " " In my room . Daddy said I could have it . " " Well , that 's not what I said to put on . " She took him in his room , opened his bottom bureau drawer , and pulled out a set of red plaid pajamas creased so badly it hurt her to think she had n't told him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks before . " Here . " She thrust them in his direction . He frowned . " Those are lame . " " You going to be lame if you do n't put these on now . " Weeks  | of not doing laundry . How could she forget him , let him go over to Dorothy 's every morning with his dirty clothes and linty hair ? Yet the bedroom they shared was as neat as if she 'd been picking up after him . " Where 's your dirty clothes ? " He pointed to the bed . " Under there . " Nettie Lee leaned against the mattress and squatted down to get a look under his bed . Sure enough , there were his clothes in a heap , everything he owned : pants , pullovers , underwear , socks , towels , everything jumbled up in a heap on the linoleum . And smelling like a rat 's behind . But how could she yell at him ? " Grandma , " he said , holding the plaid pajamas and stretching his voice into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell her this , " I know the floor ai n't my closet . " He patted her on her shoulder , in quick little flutters . " I did n't want you worrying about the bedroom being dirty . See how I cleaned it up ? " " Yeah , I see . " She felt his soft hand come to rest on her shoulder . " Get on in the bed now . " He pulled the T-shirt over his head , folded it carefully into a lumpy square that stuck between the mattress and the metal bed frame . " This is where I keep it , " he said simply , and put on his pajamas and got into bed . On the six o'clock news , Brian Hayashi interviewed a woman whose thirteen-year-old daughter had been missing for two days . She held up a picture of her daughter , a smiling blonde with braces , or maybe not : Nettie Lee could n't tell with all the snow on the screen . She adjusted the rabbit ears on top of the set . Better . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replaced by another reporter , Rosie Gomez , who held a microphone to her mouth , which worked unnecessarily hard , Nettie Lee thought , to shape the words that poured out . Live at the downtown ice skating rink , breath gusting around her head , Rosie described the skaters , the hot apple cider , the fun , all created by the local chapter of Chil-dren 's Wish . Then back to the newsroom to Carol Smith , a nicelooking woman with a big head of hair , who said that , on a more serious note , a local doctor had been wounded in front of the birth  | control clinic where he worked . The doctor had been stoned by seven women and one man , all under arrest now , who had surprised him as he left the clinic the previous evening . The group called itself People for a Better Tomorrow . A commercial came on . Nettie Lee grew impatient . She sat through the rambling questions of a man in a white jacket asking her about constipation , then a woman who confided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the month when she just did n't feel herself . That 's all right , honey , Nettie Lee thought , I do n't feel like myself , either . I do n't know who I feel like . The news was back on again . George Watson , a handsome man in a plain , inoffensive way , said it was time for sports . Nettie Lee said " Shit ! " and cut off the set . The news was over . All that was left was the weather , and she knew what that would be : cold . In the kitchen , she ran hot water over the dinner dishes . Scraping pieces of greasy rice off the plates , then sliding them into the water , she suddenly felt a revulsion to getting her hands wet . It seemed too much like scrubbing up in the nursery . Her hands were chapped from all the scrubbing . She worried so much about contaminating one of the babies , especially Tookie . She cut off the lights and went into the bedroom . Lying on his back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Little Barn was still awake . Nettie Lee leaned over him . " I told you to go on to sleep . Santa Claus do n't come until everybody in the house is snoring . " He immediately closed his eyes . " I got to go somewhere right now , but I 'll be back in a little while . Stay in the bed and do n't get out for nothing , you hear ? " " Okay , Grandma . " " Can you kiss Grandma good-bye ? " She touched her lips to his forehead . " Good night , honey . " In the living room she counted twenty-seven dollars in her wallet . What kind of toys could she buy for that ? One of these days she was going to get it together . Next Christmas there would n't be a little tinsel tree with no presents beside it . Next year she would have her entire family around her , eating a big dinner and singing carols . Santa Claus would be on time ; she  | would make sure of that . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed the front door behind her , and walked OP the cold street to the corner grocery . Maybe she could find some toys for Little Barn there . When Nettie Lee came into the nursery the following Monday morning , a small group of people were leaning over Tookie 's Isolette . This was how she could always tell things were going wrong : too many experts . Dr. Xiang , Debbie Foxx , and the redheaded nurse bent over the baby . Martha moved to the side , letting them crowd in close , then came over wl1en she saw Nettie Lee . " She all right ? " Nettie Lee felt anxious , " What are they doing ? " " They decided to do the exchange transfusion , " Martha said in a low voice , her eyes worried . She pressed her lips together . " The jaundice got too bad . The light therapy they tried did n't work , and now they 're worried about brain damage . " Nettie Lee had the sensation that Martha 's words were n't real . They lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Brain damage ? She could n't make sense of the words . " What-all they going to do to her ? " She was n't sure Martha 's answer would make any more sense . " Well , I 'm not positive about everything they 're going to do , but they want to take out the jaundiced blood and put in fresh blood . " " I already know that ! " Nettie Lee looked around , then lowered her voice . " What I want to know is , how do they plan to drain her blood out ? " " I do n't know ; I 've never seen it done . " Martha seemed jumpy , unwilling to look straight at Nettie Lee or at the baby 's warming tray . Behind her glasses , Martha 's eyes kept Sliding away from Nettie Lee . " Why do n't you just go over there and watch ? " she said . Instead of going with Nettie Lee , Martha walked off in the opposite direction .  | Nettie Lee was n't afraid of blood , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it was n't spilled on something . As she approached the Isolette , she smoothed out her scrub gown with her hands . Nobody told her to go away , so she stayed . Debbie wheeled over a machine that looked like a mechanical vise with a large syringe of dark blood clamped in it . She was hooking up clear plastic tubing to the syringe , her face pointed in concentration . Dr. Xiang held the tube that came out of the baby 's navel . She attached the tube Debbie handed her to the baby 's plastic tube with a silver stopcock . Dr. Xiang said , " All right , Nurse ? " Debbie turned on the machine , which hummed , then clicked . The click depressed the plunger on the cylinder . The humming stopped . Dark blood crawled through the tube to the stopcock and waited there . Dr. Xiang twisted the stopcock valve , and the blood traveled on , winding its way to the baby 's navel . " Looks fine to me . " Dr. Xiang looked at Debbie . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Debbie nodded and looked back to the baby . As the blood entered Tookie 's navel , Nettie Lee studied her face closely for signs of pain , alert for any indication that she felt the blood moving through her . Was it warm ? Did it make her feel stronger ? Or did it feel wrong , like mixing oil and water ? Tookie slept on . I-ler face sometimes twitched , the corners of her mouth momentarily pulled up into an odd smile , or her eye flickered in a closed wink , but Nettie Lee could n't relate Tookie 's ex-pressions  --  were they expressions ? were they even the gas she had told Yolanda that Little Barn 's smiles were ? ? or any of her movements to the slow snake of new blood into her body . After several minutes , Dr. Xiang closed the valve , attached a small empty syringe to the stopcock , and withdrew blood from Tookie with a mighty pull . " This is not easy , " the doctor said to herself . She held her breath and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ syringe was full , she shut the valve and said , " All right , that looks fine . It 's time to wait . " She left the Isolette . Debbie stayed beside the baby , writing notes on her chart and  | checking the equipment  --  the respirator , the heart monitor , the mechanical vise with the cylinder of blood . After each check , she wrote more notes . Nettie Lee stood silently , feeling only the feet she rested heavily on , the rest of her light as air . She had the brilliant sensation of floating , expanding beyond the nursery , leaving the large hot room . Debbie grabbed her by the arm , her warm fingers gripping tightly through the scrub gown . " Nettie Lee , would you like to sit down ? " " No , ma'am , " Nettie Lee told her as she felt herself being maneuvered to a rocker . Her fall into the chair knocked the air out of her lungs . Debbie squatted in front of her , one hand on her knee . She pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You stay in this chair for a couple of minutes , you hear ? I 'll get Martha to bring you some o.j . " Nettie Lee closed her eyes . Damn tears , welling up and falling out . Damn tears . And yet she did n't have the strength to wipe them away . Martha stood over her , a small Dixie cup of orange juice in her hand . " Are you feeling sick ? " She thought Martha looked at her strangely . " I got dizzy , " Nettie Lee said quickly , and wiped her eyes . " Well , drink this and you 'll feel better . " " You ever get sick looking at some of the things they do in here ? " Nettie Lee asked . " All the time . I think for me it 's the smell of alcohol or whatever that smell is . Soon as you walk in the hospital you can catch a whiff of it . I used to think it was embalming fluid , but I smell it everywhere I go . Except the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lee smiled , though she felt weak . " Do n't you like SpaghettiOs ? " " Not for breakfast , lunch , and dinner . " Martha looked at her . " Mind if I 'm honest with you ? " She put her hand on the back of the rocker , dipped her head in closer . " I got a choice ? You ai n't nothing but honest . "  | Martha smiled and took the cup from her . " Want some more ? " Nettie Lee shook her head . " Why do n't you go home ? Nothing out of the ordinary is going to happen this afternoon . LaRone 's coming at four to feed her baby . And Mrs. Baker already came this morning since she had the day off , . but she 'll be back , so little Bowen 's taken care of . " Martha paused . " Who else ? Well , some of the babies get their milk through a gavage tube . The nurses will make quick work of t hat . And I 'll be sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially that poor little thing over there getting blood . " Martha looked away to where the baby lay . Nettie Lee felt much stronger . " I 'm not going anywhere . I 'm staying right here . I got work to do . " She raised up from her rocker and was deeply sorry she did for about five seconds , but by the time her head cleared she was over to the sink washing her hands , looking at the clock and planning to rock Gonsalves . She just hoped they would finish with Tookie soon . It was horrifying to keep looking over there and seeing all those experts huddled around her . The baby 's exchange transfusion went all right . Smoothly , Dr. Xiang said . She had added a small amount of donor blood to the baby 's total circulation , then removed a same amount from her , then repeated the process until all the blood was given . Nettie Lee understood that the transfusion was an effort by Dr. Xiang to lower the chemical in the baby 's blood that caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granddaughter . That 's just the way she felt about it . She briskly carried out her jobs in the nursery , but she felt mopey inside . Or maybe defeated was more like it . She had never let the trials of life get her down before , but this whole mess seemed like more than she knew how to handle . Right before the four o'clocks , LaRone and Shavonne came in to see Daquille . LaRone looked dressed for a party , and Shavonne , in her big maternity sweatshirt and baggy purple jeans that sagged into a puddle around her ankles , was talking trash . " And I told him he 's working my last nerve , and that ai n't  | something he want to do . " Shavonne grabbed her belly on either side and rubbed . " This baby is kicking me . " She rubbed in deep circles , groaning . " Every time I talk to that fool the baby acts up . " " What did he say about a job ? " LaRone leaned closer to the Isolette , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Job ? I got to spell the word for him . He act like he never heard it before . He says he 's not ready to get married , but he 'll be here for the baby . Meanwhile , I got to pay his rent . " " Do n't get caught . You know that case worker will look in your closet to see if he 's keeping his clothes in there . " LaRone looked at the nursery clock . " She already did that . That nigger do n't have no clothes anyway . What he does have , he keeps at his mama 's . " LaRone rubbed her hand across the top of the Isolette . " I want to feed Daquille now . " " He 's asleep . Do n't be waking him up to feed him . " " Look how his blankets are all messed up like he 's been kicking around . " She straightened up . " I think he got hungry , then went back to sleep . I do n't like him going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Where 's your scrub gowns , la-dies ? " LaRone touched her hand to her forehead . " Oh , yeah . I 'm going to put it on right now . " " Why we got to wear them things ? My clothes are clean , " Shavonne said loudly , while walking to the scrub room . When they got back , Nettie Lee told LaRone , " You want to feed your baby now ? Tell the nurse . It 's your baby . " She saw LaRone hesitate . " Go ahead . See Debbie Foxx over there ? " Debbie stood at Tookie 's tray , looking at Tookie and talking to Dr. Xiang . " Go tell her your baby is hungry and you want to feed him . It is four o'clock . " LaRone walked over to the nurse . Nettie Lee watched Shavonne rubbing her stomach down low . " So how 's your baby today ? Looks like it 's kicking . " " It 's doing somersaults , " Shavonne told her . " I used to say I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wo n't have to mess with no periods every month , but this is starting to be aggravating . And I got acid on my stomach . " She groaned . " You got a Tums ? " " No . Go on down to the gift shop and get yourself some . I know I saw some down there . " " That 'll work . I 'll go later . I know LaRone 's going to take her time feeding Daquille . She wants to get used to him before she gets him home and do n't have all these nurses and doctors to ask questions to . " " She 's a smart girl . " LaRone came back . " She said to ask you to get the feeding out of the freezer for her . " Nettie Lee pulled a four-ounce bag of breast milk from the freezer and ran warm water over it in the sink . She poured two ounces of it into a nurser and handed it to LaRone , who sat in the rocker talking to Daquille . " Here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , worked the nipple into Daquille 's mouth . He took several soft smacks of milk , then stopped , the milk spilling from the side of his mouth . Shavonne blew air out of her mouth . " You letting him waste it , LaRone ! See , I told you to let the nurse do it . " Nettie Lee interrupted Shavonne . " He 's doing okay , LaRone . " She stood behind the rocker . " He just too anxious . Hold him real close to you . " LaRone tucked Daquille against her breast . " Now , put your face right in his . Look that boy right in the eye and put the bottle in his mouth . Now tell him you know he 's hungry and you got just what he needs . " LaRone 's murmurs were soft at first , directed quietly at Daquille . Milk still drooled from his mouth . " That 's all right , " Nettie Lee said . " That 's just what you want to do . Tell him Mama 's got some food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting it in his mouth , but now he 's got to swallow it . " " Okay , baby , " LaRone said , louder this time . " You doing okay . That 's right . Take another swallow . " Daquille 's eyes locked on  | LaRone 's , his mouth pulling at the nipple . She bent closer . " That 's right . You doing it just right , Daquille . You doing fine . " " Babies need encouragement , even for something as simple as eating . Especially little babies like yours . They 're laying around the hospital all day , maybe they forget they supposed to be held and loved . " " Well , when LaRone gets Daquille home , she 'll be missing these nurses , " Shavonne said . " She be doing all this work by her-self . " " That bother you , LaRone ? " " It 's all I worry about . " " See , LaRone got insomnia , " Shavonne said . " She do n't go to bed until three in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be looking at me . I see you up in the bed reading that Mr. Spock book . " Shavonne turned back to Nettie Lee . " She trying to figure out how to raise a baby by reading a book . I told her ai n't no book going to be doing the two A.M. feedings . Of course , she be up anyway since she ca n't sleep . " " You 'd be surprised at all they tell you in that book , " LaRone said , keeping her eyes locked with Daquille 's . " Keep on reading it then , " Nettie Lee said . " A little knowledge is a dangerous thing to waste . " " I 'm too sick of school to be reading books , " Shavonne said . She rubbed her stomach and groaned . " I 'm going to find me a chair . " A little after four o'clock , Martha had pulled her rocker next to LaRone 's . Nettie Lee asked Martha whom she planned to feed . " I 'm planning on Riley , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other plans ? " " No , that 's fine with me . I'ma rock little Gonsalves . I have n't really talked to him since this morning , with everything that 's been going on . " She looked to Tookie 's spot in the horseshoe . No one stood by the warming tray and respirator . The baby slept peacefully , alone . The four of them sat opposite one another , rocking babies and giving the four o'clock feedings . Nettie Lee and Gonsalves , then Martha and Riley on one side , LaRone holding Daquille and , next  | to her , Shavonne with no baby in her arms on the other side . Gonsalves and Daquille Cruz were next-door neighbors , of a sort . Gonsalves would be considered the loud neighbor who partied too much . He stared from his incubator with wide , alert eyes , scissorskicked his legs constantly , often cried inconsolably . Nettie Lee found him hard to feed . First she had to calm him , hard to do with his hypersensitivity to touch , but she figured out that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swaddled so tightly he looked like a bullet . She had to rivet his attention on her eyes to encourage him to eat  --  really , she thought , to convince him that living was worthwhile . Nettie Lee coaxed Gonsalves into taking extra swallows of breast milk while Martha soothed Riley into drinking more soy . She could feel LaRone watching her , imitating the movements she made with Gonsalves  --  the little pats and adjustments  --  with her own baby . Nettie Lee thought briefly about Yolanda . Thinking it could be her own daughter she was showing how to take care of a preemie . It could be Yolanda and Tookie sitting with her at home . LaRone sat Daquille on her lap to burp him , just like Nettie Lee did Gonsalves . Daquille 's chin rested in the V between LaRone 's forefinger and thumb , his head slumped sideways , his fat cheeks pushed against her hand . LaRone patted firmly on his back , using the same rhythm Nettie Lee patted out on Gonsalves . LaRone was going to do okay . She just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things for her baby when the time came . Shavonne was another story . Nettie Lee looked at her . She 'd gotten a little wooden rocker with no arms from the supply room . Rubbing her belly , her short fingers meeting deep in her groin , Shavonne rocked along with the other women . With nothing to occupy her hands , Shavonne seemed fidgety , kept playing with gauze pads or little Band-Aids she picked up from the utility tray next to Gonsalves 's Isolette . She was just a bored kid with nothing to do except have a baby . Nettie Lee shook her head . " Martha ? " " What ? "  | " Did I ever tell you about the time I got pregnant with my daughter ? " Yolanda was my change-of-life baby . At first when I turned forty I wondered what all the fuss was about . You know , you hear from everybody whose business it ai n't , " Forty ? You 're too old to pass the mustard . " I did n't feel old , but I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd been without a man for ten years . They say a woman 's prime is those years in her thirties . Well , I guess I had my prime all to myself . Then all of a sudden everybody else got the same idea and started doing what I been doing . It was women 's liberation time , time to cut loose from men . All over the place I saw women who said they burned their bras . I heard one woman say on the TV that a woman without a man was like a fish without a bicycle . Well , I did n't have a man , and I was n't looking to climb up on top of no bicycle neither . I felt like the things I did n't have , I did n't need  --  or I would already have them , right ? I did n't need liberating because nobody was holding me prisoner . Then Sweet came along , and all of a sudden what I thought I needed changed . I got into forty a little ways , then something in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mirror . My hair was short and kinky , my hips were too big , my face too round . I started thinking I needed negligees and lace brassieres . I thought I had to buy me some perfume from the grocery store , to try those recipes in the Family Circle magazine that tell you how to cook a fancy meal . I read the Reader 's Digest articles like " Fifteen Things a Woman Should Never Say to a Man . " It turned out I had already said fourteen of them , and the fifteenth was on my lips . I was trying to step outside myself , trying to find out if what a man saw when he looked at me was anything he 'd want . I got scared . I started noticing when I went anywhere  --  downtown , the grocery , getting on the bus , anywhere I was  --  I saw nobody would look at me . Their eyes would slide right past . Then I would try  | to be those other people , try to figure out , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I figured it out  --  they 're the center of their world , so I was just scenery , not important . I was the fat woman buying pork chops at the corner grocery . I was the heavy-set woman with the bad feet at work . I was the husky woman with the thin hair at the beauty parlor , the one they had to use the little tiny rollers on . For years , I paid good money for a frizzy head of hair , but it was n't what I wanted . I wanted to be sexy . Before I saw Sweet , I was reduced to ugly in my own eyes . I knew that 's why I had to have him , to prove I still existed . I do n't know what made him want me . I could give him the usual motive , that he was a man and I was a woman and men always got to try , but that would n't be fair to him . Yolanda is always telling me to be fair to her daddy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But to be fair , this is what I know : At forty I did n't know nothing about going out on a date , so I kept Sweet home in bed . If I had thought about it for any length of time , we would 've gone out somewhere , a walk in the park , a cup of coffee on a Sunday morning ; maybe we should have sat in church a few Sundays . I see people do that all the time ? just sit around and be with each other . But I felt nervous with him , like I could n't look him in the face without my own face twitching , like I had to be more than I was to keep him interested . That 's the thing about men , that 's what kept me away from them for ten years . They have a short attention span . They need to be entertained or they get bored . It was n't a mystery to me how Sweet got his name . That man was sweet as an all-day sucker , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , belly round too , but that did n't matter a bit because , like I said , I was ten years without a man . Now do n't get me wrong , I was n't settling for less . By the time Sweet Smoaks saw me in the street , walking past the pawnshop where him and another man were leaning in the doorway fussing at each other , it took a different kind of man to get my eye . I was n't interested in looks by then . I wanted a man with some weight to him , a man who would n't blow down in a stiff wind .  | He stopped fussing long enough to look at me , real sweet , with his eyes just on me . I knew that ignoring him would cause me more trouble than just saying good morning . I knew I should just speak to him and be done with it . I turned my head real quick , and said , " Hi , " and he said , " No , " like I asked him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I was past him , and the smile on my face belonged to just me . He started calling after me , " Hey , Miss Lady , you in a hurry ? " The smile came off my face . I was forty years old , and I did n't want somebody yelling after me in the street . I was n't some child , still afraid of boys on the one hand and boy-crazy on the other . I stopped walking , turned back to the man , and really gave him a good look . I mean , if he wanted the job as my boyfriend , then I wanted to see who I was hiring . He looked like he was about thirty-eight or so , pleasantlooking . The only lines on his face came up around his eyes when he smiled , and to be fair , he kept that smile on his face for a long time , until things went bad between us . Now that smile , I got to explain it . It was all natural . It was the expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , if man was n't so busy making trouble . Standing out on the street , I studied him from his Jheri-curled head to his red platform shoes , and honey , every time I got back to his natural God-given smile , I knew that man had the job . He could talk about anything , I found out later , from the presidential primary to that movie about that funny girl , Barbra Streisand , but he did n't know how to talk to a woman . It still surprises me when I think about it , makes me wonder how I fell so hard for a man who did n't know how to talk me into it . After I was done looking at him , I remembered his answer to me saying hi . I said , " You into drugs ? " and he looked offended . He hemmed and hawed ; then he said , eyes brown and clear as a German shep-herd 's , " No . I told you I was n't high . That 's not my bag . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Miss Lady ? " in some kind of hip way , like he was supposed to be groovy .  | The whole thing tickled me , him making such a lame effort to be cool , trying to get my attention , while life was passing through my body like I was n't any encumbrance to the flow of people around me , like I did n't exist . Here was a man who stopped me with his smile and pinned me down to the moment we were living in . Well , I guess I was impressed . Sweet was a hard-loving man . Not physically hard , because he was gentle in that way , but he was mentally hard for me . Loving him took up all my thoughts , no room left for me to think things through . Before he came along , I was worrying about where my life was headed  --  did I want to continue with my job at Dayton Tire and Rubber or did I see something different for the future ? When I thought about what I wanted to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the assembly line at the tire plant was n't leading nowhere . It paid all right , but it was n't nothing spectacular . I knew I 'd never get promoted out of that job . I wanted a change for myself . I thought maybe I 'd retrain for something at the community college , like a licensed practical nurse . That 's back when the college was brand new . I 'd lay in the bed at night trying to figure it out . Did I have enough money , did I want to work at night and go to school during the day ? But having a man around was so arousing for me that I got overly optimistic . All of a sudden I just knew everything was going to be okay , and I slipped out of the habit of thinking about my future . I let the school calendar get buried under newspapers and old Family Circles . When I was straightening up one day , I must have thrown the calendar out . You get a lazy , fat feeling when you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , smiling the whole time because he was going to be eating them . I arranged the chairs in my house to the best spot in front of the TV because I knew he was going to be sitting in them . I went around the house sitting in chairs , looking out windows , laying in the bed , pretending I was Sweet , testing out everything for him , seeing life with his eyes , feeling love with his heart . In the hours I was at work , Sweet 's face would roll up in my mind ,  | the way his eyebrows met over his nose , the flat space on his forehead . I said his name over and over in my mind : Sweet Blanford Smoaks . I got him in my bed real quick , before he could drift away . Sex can be like that : one minute you think you got to do something about the longing in your heart , the worse longing between your legs , then the next day you do n't remember why you cared . Let that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really got a mountain of indifference to climb . I wanted to get him into my bed while I still felt roused up , still cared about what his mouth would feel like on my neck , what his hands would be like on my breasts . I realized I had missed being touched all those years . And Sweet knew what to do . He was just lovely , I 'll say , and I 'll have to leave it at that . The rest is my business . Now , what usually follows after lovemaking is a love child . Being forty did n't make that any different for me . I missed my period that first month . I did n't tell Sweet right away , since I did n't know how I felt about it myself . I loved babies , always planned on having one someday . In my twenties I guess I was lucky I did n't get in the family way , for all the carrying on I did . Since I did n't get pregnant then , I just assumed I could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there I was , forty and pregnant . On the one hand , I was facing my dream come true ; on the other hand , I did n't know that man from the man in the moon . I started dreaming in sepia tones , like the old brown photographs M'Dear set on our mantel in Chicago . In my dreams the landscape was brown and cream , the people dark and slow . I dreamed about sailors riding the ocean , whales sliding underneath ships . About shrimps and catfish scooting across the ocean floor , looking for trash . About bathtubs with babies in them , overflowing , flooding out the houses they were in , the water traveling down streets , rushing through gutters , stopping at my feet . I 'd wake up at two in the morning , crying for M'Dear , only the words were n't coming out , they were stuck in those sepia-toned dreams . It went on for two months , got so I would n't go to bed at night .  | I waited for Sweet to leave at six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'd take my blanket off my bed and head for the couch . Laying on the soft lumpy couch , I remembered something M'Dear said to Daddy Walter when I was five , and M'Dear and him had all of us kids . She said , " Water dreams . I 'm having me some water dreams , Walter . Guess I 'm having me a baby . " I was laying on the couch half asleep , the air crawling into my throat and me huffing it out without thinking about it , my mind just dead . I did n't want to sleep , but I was too tired to wake up . My throat felt sore and rough , and my head hurt . I sat up with the thought of being pregnant rolling through my head . I laid on my back and felt my stomach between the hipbones , ran my hands over the loose skin , pushed my fingers into the crotch hair . Nothing . I just did n't feel nothing . But the thought of a baby growing inside , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my stomach . Outside , the air was getting hot . I could feel it when I walked past the living room window to the bathroom . I stopped and pulled the window down across a sheet of hot air hovering just inside . Hanging over the toilet bowl , retching till it hurt my stomach , I thought if it was true , if there was a fish baby in there , I could retch it up , spit it into the toilet , flush it away . I guess I knew right then what Sweet would say about a baby . Water dreams . I guess I 'm having me a baby . Daddy Walter had told M'Dear , " No , you ai n't . " He was right . M'Dear did n't have her baby . When I was a child , I wondered how Daddy Walter knew . I came out of the bathroom , back to the couch . I tried to lick the sour taste out of my mouth , then sleep . Water dreams . A sepia man standing on the prow of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom of the ocean . Whales sliding underneath . The ship . The waves . Water dreams . I guess I 'm having me a baby . I kept checking between my legs for blood , the sign I was n't pregnant . I felt sore and full down there , knobby from all the wiping I did with toilet paper , all the checking I had done in the past couple of days . No blood . Nothing yet . But I was having water dreams , and I was having me a baby .  | Sweet sat on the couch , his hands folded in his lap like he was saying his prayers . I hoped he was praying for a new family . " Okay , I 'm here , so what you want ? " He let his hands loose from his lap , folded his arms . The way he was sitting , legs crossed , foot jiggling up and down , so impatient , turned my stomach hard . I made my face into a mask he could n't take off . No use for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk to you about something important . " I watched him fidget , brush his nose with his finger , look away from me to the wall behind my head . " What ? " He made it sound so easy . What ? A little tiny word . " A baby . " I said it , and I watched the understanding of it fly across Sweet 's face . He opened his eyes wide , let his mouth drop . " Do n't try to act surprised about it , " I said . " I ai n't ready for no games . " " What you talking about a baby ? You sound like you think that thing is mine . " Oh , no . Here it starts : I know that ai n't my baby , since you done slept with every man in the neighborhood , and I 'll call them in to say so , if you make me . " How you know it 's mine ? " " Fool , who else 's do you think it is ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life is your own damn business . " I felt my hand twitching to slap that man . " You want to repeat yourself ? " " You heard me . Every woman that says , I 'm pregnant , you the father , ' be getting away with murder . Who 's going to disprove it ? Naw , do n't put that stuff on me . Not me . No . Lot more than you saying I 'm the father got to happen before I become a daddy . " The man was being so typical , I got embarrassed . My stomach cramped up . I think a baby knows what 's going on around it even before it comes out of the womb . Here 's this little tiny baby getting a good taste of what her daddy is like , a close firsthand look into the soul of that man . I put my hand over  | my stomach to rub her quiet while I said to Sweet , " Get out of my house . Do n't never think about putting your foot on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , months later , he came talking about he wanted a second chance . I had already had my baby . It went like this : Sweet said , " I want to ask you something . " I said , " What ? " That little tiny word . He said , " You still mad at me ? " I said , " What difference do it make ? " He said , " I do n't want to marry nobody who 's already got her lip stuck out . " I said , " What you trying to say ? " He said , " Will you marry me ? " " No , " I said . He said , " Why not ? " I said , " It 's too late . " " But we got a baby together , " he said . " It do n't matter , " I said . Then he had the nerve to get mad . " God , woman ! I do n't know what you want . I try to do the right thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me down . " I said , " You had your chance to be a man . You want to do the right thing when it suits you , that 's all . What am I going to do when it do n't suit you no more ? " He said , " So , it 's like that ? " and turned away . " Look , " he said , " you got every right to be mad at me . I was disrespectful to you . But I 'm sorry . I just love you and I want to be a father to my girl . I knew I was wrong not to stand by you . I was scared , Nettie Lee , that 's all . I want to stand by you . " I said , " I do n't know what to tell you . " He said , " Then do n't tell me nothing right now . Think about us being a family . Think about us being together . Okay ? Think about it ? " I said I would think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold my eyes open .  | He went on about his business and I flopped in the bed . I never been so tired . Through all the months I was pregnant with Yolanda , I was n't as tired as I was on that day arguing with Sweet . Yolanda was sleeping in her bassinet in the bedroom . I slept beside her all that afternoon . When Yolanda woke me up crying to be fed , I knew the answer to Sweet 's proposal was no . After he was gone for a year , he had the nerve to call me and tell me where he was : Toledo . I reported him to the Montgomery County district attorney . After I did that , Yolanda 's sixty-dollar checks started coming in , with a four-dollar collection fee taken out by the county . I never saw him again , just talked to him a few minutes on the phone every once in a while when he was calling for Yolanda . He told me once , during one of his let's-be-friends phone calls , he wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and put it in a bank account until Yolanda was ready for college . My answer was , " What 's she going to eat off of until then ? " Then he got married . With his first wife , he told me he was going to electronics school to get a better job . He said money was tight right then , with him just getting married . Would I defer his child support payments until he got out of school ? I said , " Oh , you going to school now ? That 's funny , so is Yolanda . Is she supposed to starve until you get smarter ? " It just did n't make sense to me that he thought whatever little bit he did was good enough and he should be congratulated for it . But the simpleminded part , the part I just ca n't get my mind around , is that Yolanda agrees with him . " Mama , " she says , " he 's doing everything he can . You know he does n't have much money , Mama . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once every six months and tells her he 's thinking about her . Never calls on Christmas , never calls on her birthday , never sent her a cent over what the court said to pay , that pitiful fifty-six dollars a month . Never sent extra money for school clothes . But here 's what that tells me : he was going on with his life . I guess his life was n't measured off September to September , the way it is when you got kids . I guess he did n't think about June being the time to get summer clothes ,  | September being the time for school clothes and books , Christmas being the time for Santa Claus , Easter being the time for new outfits and the Easter bunny , Valentine 's Day being the time for those little heart candies for kids , October being the time for trick or treat . That was n't how he measured off time . He got married more than once . The first time , he wanted me to be friends with his wife . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in to take his place inquiring after Yolanda 's health every six months or so . When she divorced him , when Yolanda was six , she sent me a bus ticket so Yolanda could go visit her in Georgia . There were some letters for a year or so after that ; then she faded away . Next , he had a girlfriend that gave him trouble . He would call , and I was supposed to listen to his grief . I must say I slammed down the telephone on those calls . He got married again to another woman , and they had a baby right away , then another one . I guess those kids are around ten and twelve now . Yolanda still talks to that wife now and then . Yolanda told me once the woman told her that her daddy prays for her a lot . I said it would do more good if he prayed less and did more , and Yolanda liked to have a fit . She told me I was a jealous old woman who did n't have a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told her to look around and see who was there taking care of her and who was in Toledo praying . She told me not everybody could be as mature as I was . Lord have mercy , I never heard the word " mature " sound so much like a cuss word until it fell out of Yolanda 's mouth . You know how you think your life belongs to you , it 's your history ? You think back on how your mama and daddy did this or that to you . Maybe they did n't think much of kids ' feelings , did n't take them seriously , or maybe one of them drank too much whiskey and scared you all the time , or whatever their faults might have been . Then you get grown and you realize that the whole time you were growing up , you were just a little tiny part of your folks ' lives . And here you 'd been thinking you were the center of attention . One day I 'm talking to Yolanda and it hits me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar , tapping his foot to the swing music coming over the loudspeakers , listening to the clarinets blaring out a challenge . He licked a spot of blood off the knuckles of his right hand , moving his shoulders to the beat . He smiled . He was n't a dancer , but he had some moves . Intermission at the ballroom dance exhibition merely moved the competition into the lobby of the Seal Beach auditorium  --  it was a fashion face-off , part nostalgia , part nineties romanticism . Glamorous women in shimmering silk dresses fingered ropes of black beads , men in pastel shirts smoothed their slicked-back hair . Patent-leather was everywhere . One idiot even had an ivory cigarette holder clamped between his teeth . Quinn was the only person in the room whose nose had been broken three times , the only one whose suit smelled of mothballs . He liked his nose just the way it was , but he was going to burn the suit when tonight was over . He ran a hand through his dark , unruly hair as the bartender approached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said proudly . " She 's eight years old . " " Congratulations , handsome . " She was a chunky blonde in a white nautical jacket with frayed gold epaulettes , and a vaguely interested expression . " So , what can I get you ? " " Two champagnes . " Quinn held up a ten for the drinks she poured , added another one . " Double or nothing ? You call it . " p 11 Her eyes narrowed , considering , then reached into her change pouch , deftly flipped a quarter . Quinn snatched it out of the air , slapped it onto the bar . She covered his hand with hers . " Heads , " she said . It was tails . He handed her the two tens anyway , turned her disappointment into confusion . " It was n't a fair bet , " he said , picking up the plastic flutes of champagne . " I 'm on a hot streak . Just wanted to test it out . " He made his way back across the packed room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone , gliding across the polished floor as the music rippled around him . Women glanced over as he passed , nodding absently to their companions while their eyes tracked him . He missed Jen . She had been gone almost a week and he still had n't gotten used to sleeping alone . The first few days he had stayed at her apartment , but he could n't sleep in that bed without her , his face pressed against the pillow , smelling her hair . . . He had moved back into his own place a couple of days ago , taking her pillow with him . A fat man leaned backwards , gesticulating wildly , making a point ? Quinn dipped around him , a drink in each hand , not spilling a drop . You 'd have thought it was choreographed . He could see Rachel watching him , her black curly hair brushing her bare shoulders as she swayed to the music . She wore a new dress , a crinkly rayon that followed her every movement , the back cut low to show off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past a foursome , and Rachel turned along with him , her pale-green dress swirling around her knees like sea foam . Ex-wives should n't be allowed to look so good . Their marriage had been an attraction of opposites . He was an investigative reporter , hot tempered , raw as a blister , more comfortable in the company of criminals than the cognoscenti . She was an art history professor at the university , cool and poised , able to recognize the authentic from the false , and not afraid to say so . He trusted her judgment even more than his own . Their friends were surprised the marriage had lasted six years , even more surprised that they remained such good friends after the divorce . Quinn angled his way free , Rachel applauding as he reached her unscathed . He handed her the champagne , then stole the strawberry from her glass , popped it into his mouth . An old habit . " To Katie 's debut , " he said as they touched glasses . Rachel took a sip . " So , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into his pocket , hiding the battered knuckles . " I phoned Sacramento a few minutes ago , " he said , teasing her , " the state medical board has called a news conference for tomorrow morning . Word is that three doctors on the oversight panel are going to resign . "  | She kissed him on the cheek . " You nailed them . " Last month , Quinn had written a cover story for SLAP magazine detailing the panel 's failures . Ostensibly a self-policing body to discipline doctors , the panel usually served to whitewash medical incompetence . His article quoted from their secret discussion of an obstetrician whose botched deliveries were responsible for the deaths of at least five women , all illegal immigrants . The panel had downplayed the deaths , saying the doctor 's level of care was as good as the women would have received at one of the third-world clinics in their homeland . " I still do n't understand how you hurt your hand , " Rachel said inno-cently . Quinn watched the bubbles rising in her glass . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the news out of Sacramento ? " " Not likely , " said Rachel . " You would n't waste a punch on a wall . You do n't slam doors or write letters to your congressman , either . I know you . " She was n't going to let it drop . " I ran into somebody , " he said , " an acquaintance , spotted him working the room while I was on the phone . Mid-level coke dealer , goldcard clientele . He 's not a bad guy ? " " Not a bad guy ? " " Not compared to some doctors . " Quinn shrugged . " I told him there were little kids here tonight , suggested he take his business elsewhere . " He flexed his fingers . " We had a slight disagreement about the limits of free-market capitalism . " " It 's good to see you like this again . " She was beaming . " Like what ? " " Like you were when we first got married . Charging into trouble , no doubts , no hesitations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit it in half , the remaining flesh bright-red in her pink manicured fingertips . " Maybe it 's your new job . . . " She watched him over the rim of her glass . " Maybe it 's your new girlfriend . I think Jen has been good for you , if my opinion matters . " " It matters . " " Living with you was . . . an adjustment . " Her eyes glinted , remembering . " The phone would ring in the middle of the night and you 'd be off to meet some horrible person , so excited you could hardly wait to get dressed . I 'd be scared , not wanting you to go , and you 'd kiss me , tell me not to worry , say it was only innocent bystanders who got hurt , so you were perfectly safe . " He looked away . " I was wrong , " he said softly . Two years earlier , Quinn had written a series of investigative articles  | that had gotten a serial killer acquitted  --  B. K. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few weeks after the verdict , Groggins botched a mini-mart robbery and held the clerk hostage , demanding that Quinn come to the store to broker his surrender . The clerk 's name was Doreen . She had terrified eyes and broken-backed shoes and a daughter younger than Katie . Quinn had walked them out of the mini-mart toward the police , stood right beside Doreen , holding her hand while Groggins pressed a gun to her head under the glare of the TV mini-cam lights . " Let her go , " Quinn had said . " What are you looking at here , armed robbery ? That 's chump change . " Groggins had smiled and Quinn felt suddenly sick . " Oh , we 're way past armed robbery , partner , " said Groggins . " I did some bad shit to my landlady this morning . She was fun . . . but the college girls were even sweeter . " The gun went off as Quinn tried to push Doreen aside . " You made a mistake , " said Rachel . " Sometimes I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swallowed his answer , checked the street through the windows . A hag lady clattered past , her shopping cart piled high with flattened aluminum cans and fluorescent-orange traffic cones . No one else . He could see his disappointment reflected in the glass . " Still waiting for your stepfather ? " asked Rachel . " No , " he lied . " You sent him an announcement , that 's all you can do . " " Do n't call Teddy my stepfather , okay ? " Quinn ground his teeth . " He 's the guy my mother married before she skipped out on the both of us . We shared a house and a sense of mutual frustration , which is not usually considered a lasting bond . Call him the honorable Judge Theodore Krammerson . He 'd like that . " " He sent you a letter last week at the house . You should give him your new address . I was going to bring it ? " " It 's not a letter , it 's a birthday card , " said Quinn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Every year Teddy sends me a belated birthday card with a note saying let 's have lunch . ' The first few years I actually believed him . Throw it away . " A rat-faced man waved from across the room , then started toward them , pushing his way through the crowd , making slow headway . " We should go back to our seats , " Rachel said quickly , starting toward the auditorium . " The second half is going to start any moment . " " What 's the rush ? " The man half-tripped , regained his feet . " Rachel ! " He scooted over to them , mouth twitching.  | " Oh , hi , Alan . " " Just-just wanted to congratulate you " ? the man paused to catch his breath ? " the whole department is talking about your good fortune . Not that you do n't deserve it , " he stumbled , " such an honor , we 're all basking in your reflected glory . " Quinn looked at Rachel , not understanding . " Alan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you , but we have to go inside . " " Perhaps you could put in a good word for me with the division chair , " the man called after them . " Someone has to cover your classes , and who better than me . Heh-heh . " The lights in the auditorium were blinking as they found their seats . " What 's the big honor you did n't tell me about ? " Quinn said casually , feeling his hands go cold . " Give me a chance to bask in your glory . Heh-heh . " " Let 's talk about it tomorrow . " She did n't look at him . " Tonight is special . Why ruin things ? " " Good news never ruined anything , " he said , feeling the cold spreading through him , and wishing he did n't have such good instincts about impending disaster . He was the canary in the mineshaft . The dog that howled before the earthquake . " Tell me now . I ca n't wait until tomor-row . " " I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strain to hear her . " From the Sorbonne . . . they want me come to Paris and teach courses in American Folk Art . They offered me a two-year contract . " " Two years . . . ? What about Katie ? " The announcer 's voice was fuzzy over the P.A. , something about the mambo contest . " Rachel ? Look at me . What about ? " " She 'll come with me . " She bit her lip . " Happy now ? " The mambo dancers burst onto the stage , three couples twirling in the spotlights in a merry-go-round of red ruffles and Brilliantined hair , all those long legs in perfect syncopation , the steamy Latin beat rolling through the room . The audience leaned forward , fanning themselves , but Quinn was frozen to the back of his seat . " Just like that , you decide ? " Quinn said as applause burst around them like gunfire . " I 've got rights . " " You 've got a record , I 've got custody . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm sorry , I did n't mean to say that . " " The charges were dismissed , Rachel . "  | " I said I was sorry . " A net of fine wrinkles creased her high cheekbones , her eyes like black pearls caught forever . Someone nearby shushed them . " I have n't decided to take the Sorbonne 's offer , " Rachel said quietly . " Let 's talk about it tomorrow . " He started to respond , but the announcer said something about " talented youngsters " and the two of them stopped , called an unspoken truce as Katie and the rest of her dance class peeked through the curtain . The line of twelve little girls wound from behind the curtain in frilly white skirts and wrist corsages , tap-dancing to the opening bars of some Janet Jackson song about sexual fantasies . " Should n't they be tapping to ' Puffin ' on the Ritz ' or Good Ship Lollipop ' ? " whispered Quinn , uneasy as the prepubescent chorus line strutted to the beat . Camcorders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouthed " Hi , Daddy " at him , stumbled slightly , then caught herself . She had Rachel 's curly hair and his big bones . Quinn swallowed , waved back . Last week he had bought her a new Barbie doll and discovered that Ken now came with an optional earring . Everything was chang-ing . He tried to imagine his life without Katie for two years . No Sunday afternoons spent watching pro basketball on TV , Katie shouting " Dunk ! " everytime the Lakers got the ball . No more water-balloon hide-and-seek in the backyard , the two of them drenched , Rachel shaking her head in mock disapproval through the kitchen window . Two years . She 'd be ten . What would he be ? " Maybe you should take the job , " he said , " go to Paris , enjoy yourself . Leave Katie with me . I 'll take care of her . " She did n't answer . The tap dance class finished their number , took a group bow as the applause began , giggling now , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , wishing it was darker in the auditorium . The announcer introduced the judges : a buxom woman in a sequined dress , a short man in a baggy white dinner jacket , and " our very special guest , three-time national ballroom champion . . . " Quinn felt his brow furrow as a handsome older man acknowledged the applause with a nod , his face lean and sensual in the spotlight . There was a red rose in the lapel of his black tuxedo . " Joe ? " Quinn could n't believe it . " Mr. Joseph Staducci ! " " Surprise ! " Rachel grabbed his arm , pleased with herself . " It was Joe 's   idea . Why did n't you ever tell me about him before ? He came by the house looking for you and heard Katie practicing her tap . The two of them hit it off , which was a shock  --  you know how she is around strang-ers . " Quinn was on his feet . " It 's Joe Steps . " He was smiling so hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would disappear . " I have n't seen him since I was a kid . I . . . I thought he was dead . Teddy told me he was dead . " Joe Steps blew Rachel a kiss , waved to Quinn . His dark hair was shot with gray , but he moved with the same commanding grace Quinn remembered . Caesar ordering the legions into battle . Basking in the cheers of the populace . It took Quinn a few moments to realize that Joe Steps sat in a wheelchair , its sleek chrome frame glinting in the warm yellow stagelights as though it was made of gold .  | Red letters dripped down the living-room wall  --  wHITE PowER ! " Who are you kidding ? " the judge snorted , shaking his grand silvery mane . " You expect me to believe you two are Aryan Brotherhood ? " " That 's alright , Teddy , " said Hugo , " the paint job is n't meant for you . " The room was quiet except for the hissing of the aerosol can as Rick started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ZOG USA ! or JEW BABYLON ! " I 'm disappointed in you , Hugo , " the judge said . " Look at the baggy plastic gloves you 're wearing ... " " What about them ? " Rick said defensively . " We use them at the salon when we do a dye job . " " You should be using surgical gloves , " the judge said to Hugo . " You 've never killed anyone before , have you ? It 's not as easy as you think , and getting away with it is even harder . Stick with Gidget here and you 're going to the gas chamber . " " Why do n't you shut him up , Hugo ? " " Hugo does n't shut me up because Hugo has a functioning cerebral cortex , " the judge explained patiently . " He can project himself beyond the immediate situation . He has the intelligence to entertain doubts . And fears . He can imagine the consequences of harming a sitting judge . " " I 'm not afraid of you , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Be quiet , Rick , " said Hugo . " Me ? " " It 's not too late , Hugo , " said the judge . " Do n't let him push you into something you 'll be sorry for . " The judge 's voice was a steady , rumbling growl . He did n't beg . He did n't whine . He still did n't ask who had sent them . Maybe he knew . Or maybe he did n't care . No , the judge had staked out the high ground a long time ago , and regardless of what happened , that 's where he was going to make his stand . Hugo found himself wishing again that he and Rick could walk away , just drive off , and not look back . " What 's wrong with you , Hugo ? " Rick had stopped in the middle of a word . " Kill him ! " " Do you hear that , Hugo ? " the judge said . " That 's the voice of the mob shouting at a man on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very long way down . Farther than you can possibly imagine . " The judge spoke so softly that at first Hugo thought he was talking to himself . " You listen to that voice , you 'll fall forever . " Hugo could see a tiny vein throbbing on the side of the judge 's head . He wanted to reach out and smooth it . " Do n't just stand there , Hugo ! " Rick fumbled for his pistol , snagged it on the lining of his pocket . " I 'm going to take care of my chocolates before they burn , " the judge said carefully , slowly walking toward the kitchen . " You want to kill me , you do it in there . " Hugo followed him . He heard the spray can crash into the living-room mirror , and Rick was right behind him , cursing , waving the pistol . The kitchen was huge , clean , and efficient , with a pink-marble cooking island , the walls lined with copper-bottomed pots and pans . An antique white-pine china cabinet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ littered with broken dishes and shards of crystal . The monkey wrench was embedded in the center of the matching white-pine dining-room table . The judge had turned his back on the wreckage , standing over the commercial stove , stirring a double boiler . He brought a spoonful of chocolate to his lips and blew on it . " Almost ruined , " he pronounced after a cautious taste . He held out the spoon to Hugo . Hugo shook his head . " Skin and bones , " the judge chided . " You 're going to starve to death if you do n't eat something . " " Not me , " said Hugo , laughter bubbling up inside him too fast for him to stop it , " I 'm living on love . "   The judge licked the spoon clean , watching him . For the first time , Hugo thought he looked scared . The kitchen smelled of butter and chocolate , so rich that the sensation was more tactile than olfactory , a heavy drapery of reeking sweetness . Hugo 's mouth watered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He swallowed , feeling dizzy with disgust . The judge indicated the neat rows of candy on the marble countertop . " Try one from an earlier batch , Hugo . No ? You 're really missing something . I use almond butter , and bulk chocolate from this specialty outfit in Seattle , with just a touch of framboise liqueur , plus some other things , too , but that 's a secret . It took me months of fooling around in the kitchen to get it right . My son loved them when he was a kid . He 'd gobble them down while they were still warm , make himself sick . " Hugo glanced toward the front door . " He live here , too ? " " No . . . " The judge stared sadly at the rows of chocolates . " He 's all grown up now . I hardly see him at all . " The phone on the wall rang and they all jumped . " You 've got to let me answer it , " the judge said to Hugo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't answer , they 're going to think something is wrong . " " Finish him and let 's get out of here . " Rick shifted from one foot to the other . " It might be one of my neighbors , " said the judge , " wanting to know why I need a plumber . They could have already ? " Rick picked up the phone , answered with a cheery hello in that fake British accent he affected at the salon . He smiled at Hugo . " Who am I ? Who are you , luv ? " He nodded at the receiver , licked chocolate off his glove . " Let me ask you something , missus . . . how much would you pay for a depilatory body sugaring ? A complete body sugaring ? Hmmm ? " He slammed the phone down . " The wifer hung up on me . " " I want to speak to her , " the judge said to Hugo . The phone rang . " Let me answer it , " said the judge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until she calls the cops . You 'll have to rush off and where 's the fun in that ? I wo n't say anything to her . What good would that do ? " The phone rang again . " I wo n't say anything about you . " " Do n't let him , Hugo , " yelped Rick . " Teddy is a man of his word , " said Hugo , looking right at the judge . " Besides , he 'd hate to have his wife hear the sound of him dying . She 'd never forget something like that . " " We 're not that different , you and I , " said the judge . The phone rang a third time . " We 're more alike than you can imagine . "  | Hugo thought that one over as the judge grabbed the phone . " Hi , honey , " the judge crooned , his voice so tender Hugo did n't recognize it . " How is the party ? Good . I wish I was there . No , really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Rick capered near the judge , giggling , quick-drawing his revolver like a gunfighter , fanning the hammer with the side of his hand , making pow-pow-pow sounds as he pretended to shoot the judge . " I 'm almost done with the chocolates , " the judge said to his wife . " I think you 'll enjoy them . " He played with the phone cord , listening . " I am watching my cholesterol , honey , you know me , healthy as a big old bear . " " What are you waiting for ? " Rick hissed at Hugo . The room was brighter . Hugo blinked , thinking for a moment that Rick had turned the lights up , the glare off the white tile so clear and sharp he could hardly stand it . He could see his reflection in the shiny copper bottoms of the cookware on the wall , the pistol glittering in his hand . " Do it , " chanted Rick , " do it , do it , do it . " " It 's nothing , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on tele-vision " ? he glanced at Rick ? " one of those hemorrhoid commercials . " Hugo had to smile . " I 've got an idea , honey , " the judge said . " Why do n't you bring the Chevertons home with you ? Ask the Piersons , too . I know it 's late but ask them . We 'll have cognac and truffles , make it a real party . Good . " Hugo pressed the barrel of the pistol against the judge 's forehead until the skin around the barrel turned white . Their eyes stayed locked onto each other , the judge 's gaze strangely soothing , luring Hugo into their gray depths . " I 'm fine , " the judge said . " I just feel like company . " There was n't a trace of fear in him anymore . " You do n't mind , do you ? We 've got plenty of time to be alone together . " He closed his eyes for a moment , opened them . " I love you too . Good-bye . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he cried , yanking his wife back from the party . He swallowed , looked away . He had a quiet smile on his face , the same smile that Hugo knew he would find in the judge 's wedding photo album , just after the I-do 's . " Drive carefully . " Hugo could hear the dial tone buzz . " Nighty-night ! " yelped Rick . The judge backhanded Rick with the phone , caught him right in the face , knocking him off his feet . " You have no idea how good that felt , " he said to Hugo , breathing hard , his eyes calm as smoke . " Opportunity knocks . . . I always answer . "  | Hugo 's hand shook slightly , unable to tear himself away from the judge 's eyes . He could hear Rick groaning , trying to stand . The judge seemed closer , just inches away from Hugo now . " Put yourself in my place , " he said softly . Put yourself in mine , thought Hugo . So much sadness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jerked in Hugo 's hand and there was a fine pink fog in the air  --  he felt it on his cheeks , a warm pink mist , tasted it at the back of his throat . Then he heard the sound of the shot echoing off the walls , heard the steady beat of phone bouncing against the floor , bobbing up and down on its spiral cord . Hugo watched the phone until it finally stopped next to where the judge had fallen , just a few inches from his outstretched hand . The judge 's legs were splayed at a weird angle . One of his shoes had come off . Hugo could see one sock stretched thin against the big toe , the sight so indecent he could n't look away . Then Rick was pulling on his arms , dragging him into the hallway . Hugo still had the pistol in his hand , it was part of him now . He staggered out the front door , expecting sirens and spotlights . The night was quiet . The houses dim . A neighborhood that minded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Rick was begging to drive , pleading that it was his turn and he never got to have any fun and . . . Hugo got into the passenger seat just to shut him up . Rick checked his face in the rearview , whining that the cheekbone was already beginning to swell , it was probably broken . He was wondering what shade of makeup would best cover the bruise . They drove slowly down the silent street , Rick muttering to himself while Hugo folded his hands in his lap and waited for something to go wrong . As they drove by a large white colonial the automatic lawn sprinklers came on in a rush , the cool , fine spray floating through the open window . All down the block , one after the other , sprinklers switched on as they passed , perfectly synchronized . Hugo and Rick glanced at each other , grinning nervously . The cabin of the van crackled with electricity  --  Hugo could feel the hair on his arms stand up . Rick snapped his fingers and another lawn erupted as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hugo , golden , " he crowed , all thoughts of his swollen face forgotten as they rolled down the block . " We can do whatever we want . Whatever we fucking want . " They pulled up to the guardshack , engine idling . Hugo squinted in the glaring light , staring at his blood-speckled gloves like they belonged to someone else . Rick was talking to the old man in the shack , but Hugo  | could n't make out what he was saying . He did n't even know why Rick had stopped . There was no gate . They could just drive through . There was a series of loud pops from the front seat , then Rick floored the accelerator , burning rubber , giggling . Hugo rolled the window down , the cool night air rushing in , blowing away the smell of gunpowder . The wind smelled of fresh-cut grass  --  Hugo rested his head against the back of the seat and closed his eyes . " Candy ? " Rick nudged him with an elbow . " I snagged some from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lips . " You sure you do n't want any ? That Teddy was some cook . " Hugo kept his eyes closed , listening to the drumming of the tires on the pavement , the sound growing louder , a howling now , drowning out the judge 's soft voice when he spoke to his wife , drowning out the gunshots and the cries that had come from Hugo 's own throat . There was just the night and the highway stretching out before him . Hugo slowly opened his eyes , blinked into the oncoming headlights . He reached for the chocolates next to him on the seat . He was hungry .  | Look at that , " Rachel said to Quinn , shaking her head in wonder as Joe Steps raced down the pier , wheelchair spinning , Katie on his lap , cheering him on . " She does n't usually warm up to adults , but she acts like Joe is her new best friend . " The Seal Beach pier shuddered underfoot as the waves crashed against it . Katie had dragged them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Joe a chance to speak . She loved the pier at night , when it was dark and mysterious and strung with tiny lights , a rickety , wooden rollercoaster jutting three hundred feet into the Pacific . " Teddy lied to me , " Quinn said , still trying to comprehend the fact that Joe Steps was alive . He kept turning the good news over and over , knowing that something was hidden inside . " He said Joe had been killed in a car crash . " Katie and Joe were far ahead of them now , the wheelchair drumming over the pier 's rough-hewn planks , Katie yelling " Faster . luster ! " as they careened past startled seagulls . Quinn turned to Rachel . " Why would Teddy lie ? " " Maybe Teddy did n't know the truth , either . He may be as surprised to see Joe as you were . " " They were best friends , Rachel , " he said tightly . " Teddy must have known . " The breeze off the ocean smelled of seaweed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , getting the bad news over his cornflakes .   Teddy had sat him down at the kitchen table and he got scared , because Teddy smelled of bourbon and it was morning and he never drank before noon . The last time Teddy had booze for breakfast had been the morning Quinn woke to find his mother gone . Teddy had n't said a word , just shoved her goodbye note to Quinn across the table . Her note to Teddy lay crumpled on the floor . Joe had showed up a few hours later . He put on a pot of coffee for Teddy , then held Quinn in his arms , letting him cry it out , not saying a word , just smoothing Quinn 's hair as he sobbed . The morning Teddy told him that Joe was dead was worse than the morning his mother left . At least that time Joe was still there . Now there was no one . Quinn remembered hanging on to the table , needing to feel something solid , wanting Teddy to look at him , hold him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a week while Quinn stayed out of his way . " Maybe they had a quarrel , " said Rachel . " Sometimes when best friends have fights , the fights are forever . Maybe Teddy did n't know how to make you understand why Joe would n't be coming back . Ask Teddy . Ask Joe . It took two of them to keep the secret . " Joe popped a wheelie , Katie squealing with delight , hanging on to him as they hurtled back toward Quinn and Rachel , their laughter echoing through the evening , the sound so bright and clear that Quinn smiled , and even the stolid fisherman leaning against the railing turned to watch them . " Give Teddy a chance to explain . " Rachel took his hand as they walked . " Give them both a chance . " Katie hopped off his lap and she and Joe Steps played tag , her hair flying as she ducked and twisted away from him . " You should have seen him thirty years ago , " Quinn said as Joe swiveled around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you almost forgot he was sitting down . Quinn expected the old woman to be angry , but Joe turned his head as he passed , winked at her , and she grinned like a teenager . " It was n't just the fancy clothes and cars , Joe had style . Everything he did was effortless  --  dancing , gambling , even the way he tied his shoes . . . he had these custom-made alligator shoes , and it was like the laces tied themselves . I wanted to be just like him when I grew up . " " You did n't turn out so badly . " " I 'm not even close . " Quinn shook his head . " The sunshine was brighter when he was around . Parties got louder . Just being near him made you feel . . . special . " " I know what you mean , " agreed Rachel . " He showed up at the front p 25 door in this pearl-gray suit , bowed , and said , Good afternoon , beautiful , can Slick come out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , but I knew he was asking about you . I was cautious at first , but that smile .. . and there was the wheelchair , of course , and those warm , brown eyes , not innocent , not at all , but pure somehow . " She shrugged . " I invited him in . " Katie hid behind the bronze seal statue that overlooked the surf . She stifled a yawn , looked over at Rachel , hoping she had n't seen . It was almost 10 p.m . Way past bedtime . " Joe had a cigar box full of old snapshots , " said Rachel . " We spent the whole afternoon looking through them . You must have been four years old in this one photo , wearing a sailor suit . . . such skinny boy legs . " The chuckle started low and husky . He loved her laugh . " My favorite was you and Joe clowning around in a big red Cadillac convertible , you pretending to drive , not even able to see over the steering wheel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as cream in the murky light . " We 'd drive to Santa Anita with the top down , radio on , me and Joe singing as loud as we could , trying to drown each other out . " He could still hear their voices , felt the warmth of the sun on his skin . . . " Where was the judge while you and Joe were cruising ? " " Right there singing along with us . The Three Caballeros , that 's what Teddy called us . Teddy was n't a judge then  --  he was just a guy from the same lousy neighborhood as Joe Steps , working days , going to law school at night . " He shook his head , darkening . " The best times Teddy and I had were when Joe came to visit . After Joe was killed . . . after Teddy told me he was killed , I was dumped at my grandmother 's . My mother 's mother , Donna . Bleached-blonde granny . Donna was as surprised to see me as I was to see her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking money from Teddy , then looking at me and wiggling her fingers for more . " Quinn laughed at the memory , but it had n't been funny at the time . It was n't really funny now . " When Teddy picked me up a few months later , " he said softly , " we had a new house in a new neighborhood . It was quieter and cleaner and nothing was any fun . " Fog drifted in from Catalina , slowly blotting out the stars . Rachel wrapped her long coat around her . Joe caught up with Katie  --  she yawned , hanging on to the wheelchair with one hand . She looked like she was about to crawl up into Joe Steps 's lap and fall asleep . Rachel walked over and scooped her up . Katie protested that she was n't tired , eyes half-closed , then leaned over to kiss first Joe Steps goodnight , then Quinn . Rachel kissed them both , too , saying something Joe before starting back down the pier , Katie slung over her shoulder .  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after her . " Parlezvous tomor-row ? " He watched them leave , did n't take his eyes off them until they were safely in their car . Rachel waved as she drove past . Joe led the way out to the end of the pier , past the shuttered hamburger shop , leaving the lights and people behind . " You 've filled out since the last time I saw you . What are you , six-two , six-three if you stood straight and proper ? " He rocked the wheelchair back and forth , keeping himself in constant motion . " Lovely wife , little girl . . . I envy you . " " We 're divorced . Almost two years now . " " That 's what Rachel said . Does n't matter , you 're still a family . You 'll always be a family . " Quinn let it slide . " What happened to you ? " Joe Steps patted the wheelchair . " Arthritis . No big ? " " That 's not what I mean . " Joe saw Quinn 's expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd be happy to see me . " " You 're twenty-eight years late , Joe . " Quinn had n't realized how angry he was . " We were all supposed to go to Disneyland , the Three Caballeros . Remember ? It was a Tuesday , I stayed home from school and you never came and Teddy got a phone call . . . he got this phone call . . . " Quinn could feel a lump in his throat too big to swallow , which was ridiculous . He was thirty-eight years old , he could go to Disneyland any time he wanted . Back down the pier there was the whirring sound of fishermen casting their lines , spinning out hooks into the darkness . " Teddy said you had been killed . A head-on collision outside of Las Vegas . " Quinn used to imagine the wreck , the scream of brakes , the car turning end over end . In his mind he saw Joe Steps with his eyes closed , sleeping through eternity , his body unscathed , suit pressed , a red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going to be back east , and I could n't go . And I was glad . I could n't stand to see you dead . " Joe smiled . " It would have been a wasted trip . " Quinn did n't return it . " Why did Teddy tell me you were dead ? " " Maybe because I was . " " No more games . " Quinn grabbed the old man 's shoulder . " If you and Teddy had a fight , you could have told me . You could have said good-bye . " The black tuxedo wrinkled in his grip , but Joe 's arm was solid and unyielding . " I hate him for lying to me , and I hate you even more for letting me believe it . You could have called . You could have written . Even my mother left a note when she took off . "  | " You got me wrong , " Joe said quietly . " You think you can show up now and we just start where we left off ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you anymore . " " I was in prison for the last twenty-eight years , Slick . " Quinn felt like he had been slapped . Joe Steps 's fingers rested on the arms of the wheelchair , his fingernails lightly tapping . It was a familiar rhythm , but Quinn could n't place it . " What . . . what did you do ? " Joe Steps stopped . Looked up at Quinn . " Nothing . " He said it without expression . " Not a thing . " His fingers resumed their tapping , hammering out the same cadence , his eyes burning . " What I was convicted of was murder . " Quinn finally recognized the song Joe Steps was tapping . It was the music Katie had been dancing to earlier that evening . He shivered . " Murder in the first degree . " Tap-tap-tap . " Double homicide . " Tap-tap-tap . He forced his hands to be silent . " I was on death row when my sentence was reduced to life without possibility of parole . " The salty breeze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no joy in it . lere I am , twenty-eight years later , free as a bird . . . Kind of shakes your faith in the legal system . " " Did you do it ? " Joe looked hurt . " No . " Quinn dropped to one knee and put his arms around him , ashamed to have even asked the question . " I did write you , " Joe said , cradling Quinn 's face in his hands , " but my letters always came back , Refused , ' and after a while I stopped writing . I do n't blame Teddy , he was doing what he thought was best for you . " " You 're here , now , " said Quinn as Joe patted his hair , his hands rough and callused from the wheelchair , comforting him in a way that Teddy had never been able to . Something was broke , Joe could fix it . Something was lost , Joe could find it . Joe had the touch . They all knew it . " You came hack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night wrap itself around Ihem . " You came back . . . that 's what matters . We 'll make up for lost time . " " I 'd like that . " Joe Steps spun his wheelchair and started back down the pier toward shore . " I remember the first time I saw your byline in the cwspaper " ? he shook his head , pleased ? " I had no idea what you were p to , and there you were all over the front page , writing about that ycho who killed the college girls . You got him off . " His expression rued bleak . " Ugly business . Somebody must have given you bum infor-m ion . That what happened ? Somebody set you up ? "  | They listened to the waves against the pier , each waiting for the other to say something . " Yeah , " said Quinn . " Not that it makes any difference . Somebody lied to me . I did n't have to believe them . " Joe cleared his throat . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always poking your nose where it did n't belong . I had to teach you to box because you kept coming home bloody from sticking up for that kid  --  what was his name ? If you 're going to have a big heart , you better have quick hands , that 's what I told you . " " Good advice , " teased Quinn . " I still got beat up . " " Well " ? Joe Steps grinned back at him ? " there were too many of them , and they were bigger . " " I was just about to quit fighting when you started with the boxing lessons . I was going to take a different route home , let that kid take care of his problems himself , but once you got involved I could n't run away . " " Sometimes it 's better to run away . " Joe licked his lips . " I read about what happened to you a few months ago , the football player who took you apart in that hotel room . " Quinn did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Liston , right ? I remember him . I used to bet college games pretty heavy way back when . He was a linebacker , played pro ball for just a couple of games during the sixties , then got hurt . Got old . Got mean . " " He almost killed me . . . " " You 're alive . " Joe Steps plucked at the spokes of his wheelchair . " You 're alive and he 's dead . " " No thanks to me . " Quinn 's voice was lost in the wind . There were tiny whitecaps on the water . " Jen . . . my girlfriend shot him . Emptied the gun into him while he held me down , beating me . His fists were so big . I remember hearing my ribs break . " His legs were shaking so badly he had to hang on to the railing of the pier . " Your girlfriend killed him . That 's right . I read that . Liston had thrown her against a wall , knocked her out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair he could see the scar along the back of her head . " So she . . . Jen , right ? So Jen comes to , sees this gorilla wailing away on you , and she does n't run away ? " " No . " " She stays . " Joe slapped his leg , delighted . " Stays and blows him away . You 're a lucky guy , Slick . Hang on to that one . Do n't lose her . " p 29 The waves were louder against the pier , the old wood groaning under the blows . " You should have let me know where you were all these years , " Quinn said . " I 'd have come to see you . " " I know . " Joe sighed . " I never expected to get out . When you 're looking at that kind of time , you ca n't allow yourself to think too much about what 's outside the walls . You do that , you go crazy . Let the past stay dead , that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Does Teddy know you 're out ? " " Yeah . . . Teddy and I made a start . We 've got a lot of catching up to do . " His eyes followed a plastic bag billow down the pier , rolling end over end until it was lost from view . " We should all get together , the Three ( ' aballeros riding the range again . Would n't that be something ? " " Let me give you a lift , " said Quinn . " My car 's right around the corner . Where are you staying ? " " Right here in Seal Beach . You can get my number from directory assistance . " " I 'll take you home ? " " Give me a raincheck , my ride 's here . " Joe Steps spun his wheels hard , spurted ahead of Quinn toward the taxicab that had pulled up next to the pier . " I 'll call you ! " Quinn yelled after him . The driver got out , popped the trunk for the wheelchair , and opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolled toward him , then easily lifted Joe out of the chair , helped him into the backseat . The man made Quinn uneasy . Under the amber streetlight , the driver seemed more scarecrow than human , his clothes flapping , his face a pale autumn skull . He nodded slowly , deliberately , at Quinn as he drove off , and Quinn had to fight off the impulse to chase the taxi down and pull Joe Steps free .  | What possible use would you be to me in Paris ? " Antonin Napitano sneered at Quinn across the vast expanse of polished ebony , his desk a mirrored black lake between them . The diminutive publisher of SLAP magazine rocked gently in a high-backed red leather chair , resplendent in white silk pajamas , spit curls carefully arranged across his brow  --  a languid emperor dwarfed by his imperial furnishings . He sipped water from a crystal goblet . " What would you do in Paris ? " " I do n't know , Nino . . . " Quinn yawned . He sat directly across from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and irritable . " I could talk to Interpol , ask them how the investigation of you is going . " Napitano continued rocking . " Interpol is vastly overrated . " " Mills of the gods , Nino , " smiled Quinn , " grinding slowly but ever so fine . " " Interpol no longer has any interest in me , dear boy . " Nino 's voice was buttery , but his eyes glittered . " Besides , you would hate Paris  --  the narrow streets , the sanctimonious intellectualism . . . " He shook his head . " Stay here . Stay where you belong . " Where was that , anyway ? Quinn blinked in the early-morning glare from the windows ? 7 a.m. and nothing was well . He had driven aimlessly all night , unable to sleep , worried about the possibility of Rachel and Katie moving to Europe , overwhelmed with Joe Steps 's return from the  | dead . Bad news and good news . He felt like a jack-in-the-box with somebody else 's hand on the crank  --  he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows , his head explodes . Quinn had pulled into the SLAP building as the sun came up , rode the elevator to the twentieth floor , then wandered the empty halls until he stepped into the publisher 's suite . He had waved sleepily to Napitano , ambled into the ornate bathroom and squeezed toothpaste on his finger , scrubbing away while Napitano reminded him there was an employees ' restroom . Quinn had nodded , then wiped his mouth on one of the monogrammed towels . " I 'm not used to seeing you here so early , " Napitano said , peering at him from the other side of the desk , " but then , Ms. Takamura is due back this morning , is n't she ? " He steepled his fingers . " A most extraordinary woman , Jen . I can understand your " ? he savored the thought ? " eager-ness . " Napitano was the first one there in the morning , the last to leave at night . When he left . There was a canopy bed in the suite and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feverish reds and blacks and purples . A Francis Bacon painting dominated one whole wall , a distorted male nude writhing in ecstasy or torment  --  the painting seemed right at home in that angry environment . Jen said Napitano 's office was a nasty little boy 's wet dream . Told him to his face , too . Jen was the best photographer at SLAP . She said what-c ver she wanted to . They had been together for three months now and Quinn still could n't believe his luck . Jen was uncharted emotional terrain , wild and independent and way too young for him . She was considering getting her navel pierced . Where was that going to lead , he wanted to know ? What else was going to get pierced ? She thought his squeamishness " cute . " He hoped he was cute enough to convince her to go to Paris with him , if it came to that . A row of televisions was set into the wall behind Quinn , sound off  --  he could see blurred images of five different news shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink . " You know , " he said , puckering his lips thoughtfully , " I sometimes imagine what it must be like , you and Ms. Takamura in bed ? " A familiar face flashed across the windows for a moment , too blurred to recognize  --  Quinn turned to the TV sets but there were just commercials and fat weathermen pointing to their maps . He shifted back in his scat . " Is something wrong ? "  | Quinn did n't answer , glanced back at the TVs again . Napitano watched him , swirling his drink , a soft little man with a round , infantile face and eyes like dirty glass . " You look tired . " Napitano pulled a bottle of mineral water from the ice bucket beside his desk , dripping water on the Aubusson as he refilled his goblet . " Would you like an espresso ? I have the beans flown in from Perugia every week . " " A double espresso would be great . " " Help yourself . " Napitano nodded to the elaborate copper espresso maker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tubes hissing . " I would n't know where to begin . It sounds like it 's about to explode . " " Pity . Helen does n't come in until eight-thirty . She makes a lovely doppio . " " Do n't you know how ? " " Of course , dear boy , but how would that look ? " Napitano held the goblet aloft in the morning light , then drained it . " Me making you a cup of coffee . . . " He tossed his head at the thought , his silky pajamas bil-lowing . " Who would know ? There 's just the two of us , Nino . " Napitano belched , not bothering to cover his mouth . " Exactly . " A secretive Italian tabloid king , Napitano had suddenly liquidated his European holdings two years earlier , moving an undisclosed fortune and his vast art collection to Southern California . Bored after three months of perfect sunshine , he decided to launch a new magazine , spending lavishly to create SLAP , a chic , upscale monthly specializing in glamour-envy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had recruited Quinn when his career was in ruins , betrayed by a source . . . a friend . Napitano said he liked individuals who were professionally disgraced , people who had risked everything for what they believed in and lost , people willing , nay eager to chop up the lifeboats as the storm gathered ? " grand bloody failures " he called them , and Quinn was his favorite . Derided at first by the mainstream press , condemned by the literati , and ignored by advertisers , SLAP 's blank-check exposes had since brought down a bishop of the Roman Catholic church , a network anchorwoman , and last year 's #3 male box-office star . Quinn had just missed nailing California 's current candidate for governor on a homicide charge . SLAP interviewed people who gave no interviews , photographed that which had never been seen . Circulation had quintupled and their ad rates were the highest in the industry . No one laughed at Napitano any-more .   You still have n't told me why you want to move to Paris . " Napitano kilned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slippers up on the esk . " You know you can trust me . " It was true . Napitano was lewd and arrogant , a short man given to owering rages and petty cruelties , but he was utterly direct and unflinchng in the face of opposition . In an age when presidents apologized to agrants and billionaires wore wigs and wept in court , Napitano begged o one 's pardon . He and Quinn were n't friends , but there was a recogniion between them , a shared sense of the unraveling of all things , and how lit le they could do to stop it . They trusted each other . It was the best they mld do . " Are you and Ms. Takamura having . .. problems ? " Napitano wagled his toes at him , and the gesture seemed both playful and strangely obscene . " Is that the reason for your sudden interest in la belle francaise ? ou want to get away from her ? " He dipped a small gold spoon into the round metal tin balanced on his lap , brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do hope your difficulties with the lady are n't . . . sexual in nature . A young woman , an older man . . . " He slurped the spoon Clean , pushing the caviar against the roof of his mouth with his tongue , bursting the cold roe . " Jen and I are n't having any problems . " Quinn watched the TVs reflected in the glass , the reverse images shimmering and out of focus . " It 's full-speed ahead for the Love Boat . " " Would you like to see my erection ? " asked Napitano . Quinn was caught off guard , but only for a moment . " No thanks , Nino. 1 scare easily . " " I 'm quite serious . " The spoon flashed in the sunlight . " It 's the beluga ? I have four ounces every morning , four ounces of vitamins , minerals , and certain trace elements not yet understood by science . A full four ounces , which is why I can not offer you a taste of my breakfast . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name of my Russian exporter . Beluga is very expensive , but it takes over twenty years for the sturgeon to attain her maturity . So many things can happen in that time , swimming alone in such a dark hungry sea . . . " He shook his head . " How old do you think I m ? " " Fifty-four . " " Yes . . . " Napitano pursed his lips , annoyed . " Regardless , I will match my erection against any man 's , regardless of age . Not size , you understand . Size is for barbarians and homosexuals . I refer to the angle of my tumescence . " The gold spoon tapped against his front teeth . " My  | hardness . " He leaned forward slightly , his pink soft face glowing with heat . " My erection is adamantine . " " Your secret is safe with me . " Napitano sighed , sat back , and slid another spoonful into his mouth . " You Americans are so fastidious , " he said contemptuously , tiny black pearls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Quinn toyed with the objects on Napitano 's desk  --  a moon rock from Apollo XI , an inscribed shard of unglazed pottery . He picked up the Roman dagger from its place of honor , admiring the spiral ivory handle inlaid with gold , then tossed it from one hand to the other , enjoying Napitano 's wince . The knife flew back and forth . Two thousand years old and its balance was perfect . He wished he could say the same thing for himself . " Careful , mi pisano . " " Who are you really worried about ? " said Quinn , slowly stropping the blade on his throat , the metal cool and sharp against his stubble . Napitano was interested now , watching with a heavy-lidded curiosity . Quinn felt the blade nick his Adam 's apple , but he did n't react , wondering instead how many other throats the blade had danced across , howling barbarians and silently praying Christian martyrs . He was blood brothers now with dust and bone , part of an historical atrocity rolling down the millennia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? the woman 's voice came from behind him , warm and teasing . Quinn flipped the dagger onto the desk , turned around and smiled as Jen threw herself into his arms . He lifted her off the floor , burying his face into her thick hair . She smelled of sweat and pine trees and camp fires . She bit his ear as they spun slowly , bit him hard . He licked her neck , tasted salt , felt her nails digging into his back " Go ahead , fuck right here on the carpet , " said Napitano , his cheeks flushed . He held the spoonful of caviar next to his mouth . " Please , do not let my presence dampen your lubricities . " He wagged the spoon at them . " Ignore me . " Jen tenderly kissed Quinn on the lips , barely touching him , breathing into his parted lips . " I 'm hungry , " she growled , then walked quickly to Napitano 's desk . She plucked the can of caviar from Napitano 's lap , dug two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roe . Napitano yelped as she sucked her fingers clean , then went back for more , eating until she had scooped the can clean . She licked her lips , her eyes on Quinn . " I missed you , too , " he said softly . p 35 Quinn watched as she retrieved the camera bag she had dropped beside the door , enjoying the way she moved . She was slim , but her hips were ripe  --  too ripe , she said , but he liked her curves . Her face was smooth , with a full mouth and large eyes . Too blatant for the Japanese ideal , she said , blaming her half-white mother . Quinn woke up some nights and just stared at her sleeping on the pillow next to him and wanted to cry she was so beautiful . She bent over the camera case , her jeans dirty , burrs stuck to the legs . Her t-shirt was smudged , her bare arms scratched . She looked up at him , caught him with those hot green eyes that knew everything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild womyn , " she said . " I could use a long bath and a longer massage . " She ran a hand through her tangled black hair . " I got back before sunup , just finished processing my film and printing some proof sheets and headshots . . . " She smiled at Quinn . " Finding you here is a pleasant surprise ... " " I 'd like to see these proof sheets I paid for , " interrupted Napitano , snapping his fingers . " I still have my doubts about this project . . . Wild Womyn Workshops , ' " he sneered . " Bored suburban wives with too many tennis bracelets and not enough orgasms . " Jen 's face hardened . She wordlessly flung a manila envelope onto the desk . Quinn stood next to her , leaning over Napitano 's shoulder as he pulled out the photographs . Jen had spent the last week at a women 's retreat in the Sierras , lugging her cameras up and down the rugged terrain , following the progress of eighteen women who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and self-discovery . Tuition by donation only . " That 's Donna . " Jen indicated a photo of a sharp-featured white teenager . " She 's a single mother . Works at Burger Chef , and hopes to be a flight attendant because she thinks it 's the most glamorous job in the world . Her two children sleep in the bathtub to avoid random gunfire . She left her tennis bracelet in the Mercedes . " Napitano grunted . " That 's Clarissa . " Jen nodded at the overweight black woman with a short sculpted Afro . " College professor . Ph.D . in psychology . She threw up after every meal for the first two days . Force of habit . " Napitano was riffling through the pictures faster and faster , a blur of faces , young and old , women with flowers tattooed around their wrists , women with cigarette burns on their arms . Jen pointed out that they all had a similar , wary gaze . The second half of the stack of photos showed the same women , but they looked different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with dirt but clean . They looked directly into the camera . Some of them even smiled . " I took those shots at the end of the week , " said Jen . Napitano quietly tucked the photos back into their folder . " Nino ! " Quinn barked , seeing Teddy 's face appear on one of the TVs , the official photo of Teddy with his judicial robes on . " Nino ! Turn up the sound ! " " Quinn ? " said Jen . Quinn hit the TV controls on the desk , fiddling with the knobs until he turned up the sound . " . . . was found last night murdered at his home in a secluded subdivision of Orange County . The cause of death was a single gunshot to the head . A security guard was also killed . " A guardshack was onscreen , one of the glass panels shattered . Something had spilled on the ground . " What 's wrong ? " asked Jen . " Did you know this judge ? " He could n't talk . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . while the authorities have clamped a lid on the investigation , sources close to ? " " Quinn ? " Jen said . He felt her hand on his shoulder . Light as a falling leaf . " Did you know him ? " The TV station had cut to a public-service ad-on . Seat belts . Wear them . Save yourself . Save your loved ones . Quinn nodded his head , unable to look at her . " I knew him . "  | A TV news helicopter screamed overhead as Quinn gunned the open 4X4 Jeep onto the Collingsworth Estates exit ramp , wind howling around him . " I know you 're upset , " said Jen , shouting to be heard . " I 'm not upset ? " He pumped the brakes , whipped around a rusted Pinto , spraying gravel . " I 'm in a hurry . A judge being murdered is a big story and I have access . . . an insight that other reporters wo n't have . You saw how excited Napitano got when I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . " She squeezed his arm . " Quinn . I saw your face . " " Do n't worry about me . I 'm tough . " " No you 're not . I 'm tough , you 're strong . Big difference . " She took his hand . " I know what it 's like to lose a father . " The wind whipped her straight black hair . " I did n't know about Judge Krammerson . . . you never mentioned a stepfather . You said your mother abandoned you ? " " I did n't use that word . I never said abandoned . ' " " You said your mother left when you were a kid , " Jen said carefully . " You said you never knew your father . The way you acted made me not want to ask you anymore about it . I thought you had been raised by a relative or foster care ? " " Teddy raised me . Tried to , anyway . " Quinn kept his eyes on the winding road , wishing Teddy had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quinn had sent him an announcement , but he should have made the invitation personal , enclosed some photos of Katie in her dance outfit . He should have at least made a phone call , told Teddy how much he would like to see him . Maybe they could all have gone out for ice cream sodas afterwards . Acted like a real family . Teddy had seen through his equivocation , his " hope to see you there ! " scrawled at the bottom of the mimeographed dance announcement . Teddy could have come , anyway . He could have taken that first step . It would n't have killed him . Funny . It would n't have killed Quinn , either . " Teddy and I . . . we were n't close . Not for a long time . " It had been years . They sent cards on holidays , sent gifts at Christmas , left messages on each other 's answering machines , relieved that there was no one home . Quinn did n't remember any single incident that had caused an irrevocable rift . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steady drifting apart and no good reason to come together . Now it was too late . Collingsworth Estates was visible from the crest of the hill , a mass of vibrant green spread across the dry brown hills overlooking the ocean . There was a drought in Southern California ; restaurants no longer served glasses of water unless asked , lawns were left to die or paved over and painted to look like grass . Not in Collingsworth Estates . No wonder they put a brick wall around the place . Teddy had moved there three years ago , right after he married Marie , and she decided that a superior court judge and his wife deserved a better zip code than the house on Ravenna . Quinn had n't made it to the housewarming , too busy staking out a wrecking yard that night , working on an auto-repo investigation . He should have gone . Backyard swimming pools shimmered in the distance , cool and blue . Teddy had asked him once if Katie knew how to swim . " Sure , " Quinn had said , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought they did n't need one . It was barely 9:30 a.m. as Quinn and Jen reached the entrance , saw a line of police cars and satellite-dish news vans parked along the side of the road in front of the guard kiosk . Two police cars blocked the way , light-bars flashing blue and red , narrowing it to one lane . A cluster of uniforms leaned against their cruisers , drinking coffee , talking with reporters . Radio probably , or newspapers . Otherwise the cops would be at attention , no coffee or donuts evident . Police spokesperson Manuel Vargas was doing a stand-up with Allison Tate of KHTS-TV , the camera framing the shattered glass of the guardshack . Quinn could see the chalk outline of a leg sticking out , surrounded by a bloodstain . Allison Tate nodded solemnly into the camera while one  | hand idly scratched her hip . Vargas was wearing a reassuring expression and a dark blue suit that probably cost a patrolman 's monthly salary . Worth every penny of it , too . He could give the department 's version @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's grandmother and make it seem justifiable . A cop held up his hand as Quinn 's Jeep neared , then jabbed his thumb toward the side of the road . He was a gruff redheaded veteran with a nasty sunburn . Quinn held up his Press ID but the cop waved it away . " Rancho Shangri-La here is private property -- no one goes in who do n't live there , or has official business . You want a press update , wait in line for Manny like the rest of ' ern . " " I 'm . . . family . Judge Krammerson is . . . was my stepfather . " " Yeah , and my stepfather 's Clarence Thomas . " " Call it in , officer . Okay ? " The redhead grunted , then took Quinn 's ID over to a squad car where he consulted with a bored lieutenant , who was spooning yogurt out of a plastic cup . The lieutenant looked over at Quinn , still eating , chewing with his mouth open , finally picked up his radio mike . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hello . " It was Rachel returning his call . " I 'm fine , " he said as Jen pretended not to listen . " Does Katie know ? " " I told her , " said Rachel , " but she did n't seem too upset . She does n't really remember the judge . " " Teddy was n't part of her life . That 's what happens . . . kids need regular contact , you ca n't do that long distance . . . " His voice trailed off , wanting her to make the connection , to say she was n't taking Katie to Paris . She did n't say a word . He saw the lieutenant hang up , then exchange more words with the redhead before going back to his yogurt . " Quinn . . . " Rachel lowered her voice , and he had to press the receiver against his ear to hear . " I wish I could help . . . but I ca n't . " Quinn listened to the dial tone , feeling Jen 's eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ID back . " Go ahead . " " Can you give me directions ? I know it 's on Forty-seventh . " " Real close-knit family , huh ? " the redhead chuckled . " Ok , John-Boy. ' lake the first right , then a left . You 'll see it . " Jen readied her camera equipment while Quinn drove them down the deserted streets , finally spotting what must have been a dozen cars parked in front of a big brick house  --  regular marked units , the nondescript grayblue Plymouths the undercover cops preferred and three forensics vans . Five techs in white coveralls crawled on their hands and knees along the  | winding driveway , another was on the front porch . Parked illegally across the street was a white Rolls Corniche with a GREENPEACE bumper sticker . Before the Jeep could come to a complete stop , a pair of plainclothes detectives appeared , eyes invisible behind dark glasses , hands on their weapons . The big one in the worn blue corduroy sportcoat leaned against Quinn 's door , but Quinn barely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concentrating his attention on the short one who had taken a position next to Jen . A sleek Asian-American cop wearing a black Members-Only nylon jacket . The big cop pretended to blow his nose on Quinn 's ID . " Boyle ? " Quinn wiped off his ID . " Boyle , you suave son of a bitch . " The big cop lifted up his sunglasses , grinning . " At your service . " Sergeant Vince Boyle was an acne-pitted barrel of guts with twelve departmental commendations for bravery , a survivor of three Internal Affairs investigations . Once , after giving a speech at the Police Academy graduation , he had whoopie-cushioned himself  --  a photo of his shocked innocence made the front page of the Police Guild newsletter that month . " I ca n't believe they fell for your family of the deceased ' horseshit at the gate , " guffawed Boyle . " It 's true . Judge Krammerson was my stepfather . " " Oh man . . . I am sorry . " Boyle looked pained . " Come on . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't track things up . " Quinn hoisted himself out of the Jeep . Jen started to open her door , but the other detective held it shut . " Stay in the vehicle , miss , " Members-Only growled . " She 's with me , detective , " said Quinn . " That 's her problem , " said Members-Only . He had a pale scar that curved down his neck . " You were cleared through the gate . Not her . She should n't even be here . " " Go on , Quinn , " said Jen . Boyle sucked on a tooth . Quinn and Members-Only stared at each other , the detective rocking on his heels , the scar along his neck pulsing slowly . Quinn outweighed him by fifty pounds , but the man looked like he wanted Quinn to make a move on him . " It 's fine , Quinn , " said Jen . Boyle ducked under the yellow perimeter tape . Quinn looked at Jen , then followed Boyle across the lawn . " I did n't recognize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been eating for two . Two hundred . " Boyle grabbed his thick love handles with two hands . " I think my metabolism must be changing . . . The captain 's giving me a hard time , and  | my old lady 's climbed on the bandwagon , too , said she does n't want to fuck no whale . Ask me , I think she needs to see a marriage counselor . " Quinn saw Members-Only stationed beside Jen 's door , following their progress . " Do n't mind Yamada , " said Boyle , breathing hard as they made their way up the steep slope of grass , " he 'd like to hand you your dentures , but it 's not personal . He just do n't like to see his cherry blossoms with white guys . " They crested the hill and Jen was lost to sight . " Yamada always gives away the first punch , " said Boyle . " You take your best shot , then he kicks the shit out of you . He even gives a little bow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last real cops left . " " Sorry if I disappointed you . " " Hey , the day is young . Besides , I seen you fight , you might have surprised him . Either way it would have been worth a peek . Break up the tension . I been to more crime scenes than Carter got pills , and this is the worst party I ever worked . The suits are falling all over themselves , and the forensic nerds brought all their new toys and wo n't let anybody else play . " A harsh blue light flared from inside Teddy 's house and they stopped to watch . " That 's what I 'm talking about . " Boyle nodded toward the big bay window . " You ever seen a Luma-Light ? There 's only one in the whole county . It 's this hot-shit arc lamp , uses metal vapor  --  better than a laser ? you can spot every eyelash and cum stain in a shag carpet . Nobody 's talking , but I think they came up with something on the doormat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wiped their feet ? " " Happens all the time . Habits " ? he patted his stomach ? " habits do all of us in . " He yawned , scratching his bristly jowls . He needed a shave . " How long have you been here ? " " Since just before midnight . " Boyle yawned again , mouth wide , yellowed teeth on display . " I was the first cop on the scene  --  caught the call over my radio , popped out the gumball , and ran every light . I saw the mess at the guardshack and knew there was n't going to be no happy ending . Look at these houses . " He waved at the huge homes nearby , the lavish landscaping . " You got a million-dollar neighborhood here , and they hire these ten-dollar-an-hour retired military police to man the front gate . " He shook his head , disgusted . " Throwing drunks in the brig do n't prepare you for what 's out there on the street . Not nowadays . " " If you were first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detail ? Why are n't you inside ? "  | Boyle spit , almost splashed his black crepe-soled shoes . " Do n't get me started . " His face was getting redder , the deep acne scars flaring purple . " Deputy Chief Feyse shows up around three a.m. in full regalia , takes charge , then asks for my notebook , my flicking notebook , which is a clear violation of departmental rules , and when I tell him I will be happy , sir , to type up a complete report , sir , he tells me to stand out on the street and guard the curb . Guard the curb . ' That pasty-faced REMF actually told me to guard the fucking curb . " He spit again . " Twenty-three years ago my brother asked me to go into the rental appliance business with him . Today , he wakes up in a mansion in Holmby Hills , and I spent the night standing in the gutter someplace where the gardeners make more than I do . " " Yeah , I can see you demonstrating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed , fumbled a crumpled pack of cigarettes out of his pocket , pulled out the last one . It was bent almost in half , but he did n't bother straightening it . Neither of them spoke until he had taken three deep drags , exhaling smoke into the cool clean air . He turned at last to Quinn . " I 'm sorry about the judge . " " Me too . " " He ran a good court  --  no bullshit , no excuses , no mercy . " Quinn watched Boyle smoke . " What happened last night ? Was there a break-in ? Teddy come home and surprise somebody ? " " Teddy ? You call Judge K. , Teddy ? " Boyle shook his head , coughed , flicked the butt into the grass . It sizzled on the dew . " Talk to me , Boyle . " Boyle picked a fleck of tobacco off his front tooth , stared at his fingertip . " It was n't no break-in . " He wiped his finger on his jacket . " The sergeant at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He looked at Quinn . " The judge has been living here for three years . . . what 's your hurry to visit now ? " They turned at the whomp-whomp-whomp sound , saw the newscopter hovering nearby . " They been flying around all morning , " said Boyle , squinting as they followed its slow progress . " If it 's not one station it 's the other . What the hell they think they 're going to see from up there ? " " They do n't care what they can see , " said Quinn , " they just want to make the viewer think he 's part of the action . " " They 're not part of nothing , " Boyle said . " They 're sitting in their living room in their skivvies . We 're here , not them . TV turns everybody  | into a looky-loo . " He waved at the helicopter , grinning as it dipped closer , the pilot indistinct behind his plastic bubble , anonymous as a mosquito in the dark . Quinn smiled , seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salute .  | ? I could give you a sea-salt rubdown later , ? chirped Rick , " exfoliate your skin cells , buff up the old aura . . . ? " Hugo heard the squirt of shampoo , felt Rick working his fingers through the foaming lather . Hugo lay with his eyes closed , wrapped in a white cotton robe in the stylist 's chair of the little salon Rick had set up in his living room . Horns beeped from the nearby freeway but Hugo barely noticed , only vaguely aware of Rick swaying against him , singing to him-self . " Nancy Tyler-Tuck did an on-the-spot report from our crime scene early this morning , " said Rick . " She dive-bombed the judge 's house in the Channel 8 skycopter . You see it ? " Hugo opened one eye . Posters of James Dean and Christian Slater and Wayne Gretsky smirked from the walls . " You did n't ? " Rick was incredulous , slouched in a billowy silk shirt imprinted with red cherries and baggy pleated trousers . There was a faint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him with the phone . He switched on the TV , scrolled past the game shows and infomercials . No news . " Maybe later . I wonder what one of those skycopters costs ? " he mused . " If I had one of those I could land in a client 's backyard for a private cut and consultation , drop right down on their tennis court . " Hugo tried to ignore Rick 's chatter , focusing on the moment , the infi-  | nite now stretching forward and back in time , going round and round and round " That fat anchorman from Channel 5 did his stand-up right where I popped the guard , " said Rick . " John Corey , that was the guard 's name . Retired from the Navy last year . They showed a picture of him in his uniform , saluting . Terrible haircut . I guess that 's why they call them jarheads . " " Swabbies . Sailors are swabbies . Marines are jarheads . " " Guardshack was totally trashed , " said Rick , soaping the nape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass  --  it looked like a bottle of cherry Coke exploded in there . " He nodded , swaying happily . " You 'll like this shampoo . It 's five percent lamb placenta , really builds up the keratin in your hair , makes it fuller . " Hugo stared at himself in the mirror and did n't recognize his own face . His ascetic cheekbones stood out in high relief like wings of bone . He had seen angel wings in his face yesterday . Now he saw bat wings . Rick bobbed around him , silk shirt fluttering , his pompadour tipped with foodcolor purple . Hugo always saw Rick as a beautiful bird , a garrulous parrot with bright plumage . . . today he noticed the dead eyes and cruel hooked beak . " You 're quiet , " said Rick . " You 're thinking all the time . It 's like they say about still waters . . . lay down beside the still waters , something like that . It means you 're real deep , like that cold lake in Scotland where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ footsteps on the stairs  --  groceries shifted in a paper sack as whoever it was walked past Rick 's door and continued down the hall . Hugo had to force himself to exhale . His hands trembled . He was never going to regain his balance , his composure , his perfect stillness , achieved at such cost and so easily shattered . After they had linked up , he and Rick had moved into a peach-colored apartment complex near the Orange County Airport , their third-floor units directly across from each other , separated by a wide stairwell . Leaning against the rickety iron railing outside his door , Rick could spit into the pink , heart-shaped swimming pool in the courtyard below . The developer had planned the building as a twenty-four-unit swing-ing-singles complex , but the sexual economy had soured along with the job market . The tenants were drawn in by the FIRST MONTH 'S RENT FREE ! sign more than the promise of nude backgammon tournaments . The swimming pool needed cleaning , the jacuzzi was broken , and someone had slashed up the red velour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late last night , " said Rick . " Are you keeping track of me ? " " I was afraid something went wrong after I dropped you off . " " You dumped the van near the bar ? You disposed of the coveralls , the shoes , the guns ? " Rick nodded . " Fine . You did your job , I did mine . " Hugo 's hands clenched , hearing again the echo of the shot he had fired into the judge 's forehead . " I expected to see your light on when I got back , that 's all , " said Rick . " It must take forever , lugging old Joe and his wheelchair in and out of your cab , huh ? " Hugo remembered watching Joe Steps talk with the man on the pier ... Quinn , that 's what Joe called him , a big guy who moved easy , standing right next to Joe , like he belonged there . Hugo had watched from the darkness of a side street , wondering if the guy with Joe was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worried just the same . " Is that who we 're working for , Hugo ? Is old Joe the one who 's paying us ? " " We 've been over this before ? " " Well , why ca n't I know ? I can keep a secret . " He drew his fingers across mouth , zipping his lips . " I 'm the only one who needs to know , " Hugo said patiently . " It 's safer that way . " " Safer for who ? " So much for the zipper . " Safer for the man we 're working for . Who else ? " " Did you see me quick-draw that guard last night ? " Rick said abruptly , distracted by a vagrant thought . " Did you ? " He made pow-pow-pow sounds , shooting with one hand , shampoo bubbles dripping off his aimed fingertip . " I almost did n't stop , this was our big getaway and all  --  then I figured , why should Hugo have all the fun ? " " It was n't fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Rick chirped , lathering away . " That first bullet busted through the back cover of the magazine he was reading . He did n't even react at first , he just slowly puts the magazine down and there 's blood all over the pages and he stares at the mess like it belongs to somebody else , then he topples off his chair . . . " Rick laughed at the memory . " He looks up at me from the floor , this dumb rent-a-cop with the blotchy skin and big pores , and he put his hands up in front of his face , like that was going to stop me . Now there was a guy who could have used a paraffin-hibiscus masque . " P 47 Hugo rose half out of his chair , disgusted . " Sorry . " Rick gently wiped shampoo away from Hugo 's eyes , not understanding . " I put a bullet through each palm , " Rick preened , " and he got the message quick enough  --  Western Union calling , you 're dead , motherfucker . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started rinsing Hugo 's hair . Hugo closed his eyes . " Maybe it 's just my imagination , " said Rick , " but I think I radiate a certain . . . I do n't know , intensity , a dangerous , very bankable intensity , like Andre Agassi or Eddie Veder . Once I get my own salon , I bet I get some serious haircare and makeup endorsements . " It hurt to listen to Rick . Particularly after last night . It was easier when Hugo could dismiss him as a garrulous fool who had seen too many action movies . Hugo liked Rick better when he 'd thought he was all talk . " I 'm not putting down the way you took out the judge , " said Rick , slathering on conditioner , his hands making slippery sounds as he worked it in , " that 's who you are , straight and to the point , and let 's be honest ? you do n't really enjoy the work . Me , I 'm an artist . Not just hair , everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pull a trigger  --  I like to think I used some creativity on the guard , a little imagination . That 's what the clients want , high-end clients . You want to cut hair in Beverly Hills , you need imagination . " Hugo slowly sighed , pushing out the screech of existence , the devouring lust . . . another sigh , longer now , one long exhalation , a single stretched note , the only song he knew , resonating from his quiet heart , beyond the dirt of humanity , the bodies , the fears , the endless scuttling . Hugo wanted none of it . Warm water sluiced through his hair , water the temperature of blood , washing him clean . Rick blotted Hugo 's forehead with the towel , feet tapping as he sized up the situation , scissors out , absently clicking , lips puckered in thought . He belted on the leather shoulder-holster he had custom-made for his three silver-plated styling scissors . " Your hair . . . " Rick plucked at the top of Hugo 's head . " All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from its holster , eyes wide as he circled the chair , bits of hair dropping onto Hugo 's shoulders . Rick delicately folded one of Hugo 's ears down with a fingertip . " You sure you do n't want me to do a modified fade ? Maybe angle the sideburns ? It would make you look younger , more fashion forward  --  this nuevo-preppy hairstyle of yours is quelle fucking passe . " " I know who I am . " " Lucky you , " sneered Rick . " Last train to Dullsville and you 're the  | engineer . Chugga-chugga-chugga . " The scissors snapped away , swooping and diving . " I was talking to those guys in 22B " ? he spoke with the same lilting rhythm as his shears ? " the guys in the metal band , well , not exactly metal , more like industrial romanticism ? " " They work in a juice bar . " " People have a right to dream , " Rick said . " You got dreams , right , Hugo ? " Hugo did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know you do , Hugo . " His fingers gently kneaded Hugo 's temples , making small circles , and Hugo gave in to it . " You need to share your dreams , advertise them , " said Rick , " that 's how you make them happen . " He nodded toward the kitchen  --  a new picture was taped to the front of the refrigerator , a photo of a sleek black helicopter torn out of a magazine . " See it , validate it . " " It 's just a piece of paper , " Hugo said . " I wish it was more than that . We 'd all be cutting out paper dolls . " Rick ran a hand through his own hair , preening for the mirror like he was the only person in the room . " The guys in the band told me the honcho from Warners suggested they do something with their look , maybe get different shaped guitars , tart up their hair . I told them I had some ideas . " His scissors grazed Hugo 's ear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was so upset when you were late last night . I was still excited about the judge , then I ran into the band in the hallway and they laid some crystal-GHB on me . I thought we could snort a few lines and go dancing . " " I do n't like drugs . You know that . " " GHB is n't drug . It 's more like an amino acid that fucks you up . " " I had to wait for Joe . Then when he got in the cab he wanted to drive around , look at all the new buildings and shopping centers . He said he hardly recognizes the area , everything is so different . He 's lonely . . . I like him . " Rick shoved the scissors into his holster . " Is that what you and old Joe talk about on those long drives ? How lonely he is ? " Rick 's face was hideous in the mirror . " Maybe you should go dancing with him ? ? give Joe a little spin on the dance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grabbed him by the shirt . Buttons popped . " I 'm sorry . " Rick placed a hand on Hugo 's chest , not pushing , more like pleading . " It 's just that I waited for you to come home and when you finally did you did n't even look over and wave or anything , just opened your door and walked inside . You were thinking about somebody , but you p 49 were n't thinking about me . I was the furthest thing from your mind . You were thinking about Joe . " In fact , Hugo had been thinking about Quinn . He could still see him standing at the edge of the pier , partially in shadow , watching Hugo help Joe into the cab . Something about Quinn 's interest , his concern , had made Hugo uncomfortable . Like he knew where Hugo had been . Like he knew what Hugo had done . Had he really done that ? Did he really stand in a man 's warm kitchen , look deep into his eyes and blow his life out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the van afterwards , seeing the fine red pinheads of blood and knowing nothing was ever going to be the same again . " You want me to give you a facial ? I got this new volcanic mud from Hawaii , supposed to be slightly radioactive . " Hugo shook his head . " Come on , lighten up , " said Rick . " You were the same way about letting me give you a shampoo . How many times did I have to ask ? A million ? A billion ? Now you like it , right ? Trust me . I 'll put the mud in the microwave , heat it up ? " He waved the scissors at the TV , turned up the sound . " It 's our crime scene , Hugo ! A live remote ! " The helicopter camera panned across a cluster of police cars parked in front of the judge 's house , lines of yellow tape flapping in the breeze , the scene barely recognizable from the quiet street of last night . " That 's where I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I bet they already ran a make on the tire tread , they got computers can do it . Good luck , Lt. Columbo ! " he mocked the screen . The announcerpilot was describing the brutality of the crime , the murder of the guard . " They have n't said a thing about my spray paint , " he pouted . " I told you , I should have marked an outside wall . That way they could see it from the air . " " Shhhh , " said Hugo , leaning forward as the camera hovered over two figures walking across the judge 's front lawn . " What did I say ? " The camera zoomed in and Hugo recognized one of the two men squinting up at the helicopter  --  Quinn . He was wearing the same suit he had on last night . Hugo had watched Joe in the rearview mirror as he drove him home , wondering what this Quinn had said that made Joe so happy . Hugo rubbed his temples as he stared at the TV , his brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was inexplicable . " You 're always getting mad at me , " said Rick , " and I never know what I did wrong . " Hugo saw Quinn cock his head , shading his eyes from the sun , and for  | some reason he reminded Hugo of the judge  --  Teddy had looked at Hugo with that same frank curiosity . As if he did n't have anything to worry about either . " What did I do wrong ? " " It 's alright , " said Hugo . " You 're not the one who did anything wrong . "  | Marie Krammerson came from behind the house , striding toward them , black dress boiling around her knees , her hair pulled severely back . Deputy Chief Feyse , a nervous bureaucrat who had never pulled his weapon in the line of duty , tried to keep up , slipping on the grass . His gold epaulets flashed in the sunlight . " She 's been putting Feyse through his paces all morning , " Boyle grinned . " He kept trying to get her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take her to a friend 's house , but she would n't leave . She stayed in the kitchen the whole time they bagged the judge , even yelled at the M.E. for handling the body like a side of beef  --  that 's what one of the forensics guys told me . You believe that ? " He patted his greasy hair . " Judge K. knew how to pick ' em . I 'd give my left nut for a broad like that . " Marie turned on her heel , said something to the Deputy Chief . He reluctantly started back to the house . " Take me , Jesus , " murmured Boyle , smoothing his jacket as Marie approached them , " I 've seen it all now . " Quinn shifted awkwardly , not sure what to do . Her eyes were redrimmed , drilling into him . He could see tiny pearls embroidered across the bodice of her black evening dress . Teddy must have loved that outfit . I le held his arms out to her . " Marie . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears rang . Slapped him  | again , even harder this time . He could n't move his arms , they were nailed to his sides . Boyle caught her hand as she swung again . She twisted in his grip , her dark eyes so fierce that for a moment Quinn thought she was going to bite him . " Three strikes and you 're out , Mrs. K. , " Boyle said good-naturedly , letting her go . " Your son-in-law ? " " You will kindly not refer to this . . . gentleman as my son-in-law , " Marie glared at Boyle , her lower lip trembling . " The only reason I acknowledged him as a family member was so that I could slap his face personally . " " What did I do ? " said Quinn , rubbing his fiery cheek . " Do n't you dare show up at the judge 's funeral , " she raged . " If you could not find the time to visit him while he was alive , I will be damned if I will allow you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . gone . " She wiped at her eyes , smeared mascara , then drew herself up straight . " You are not going to get off that easily . " Boyle offered her a handkerchief , which she ignored . It looked like he was sucking in his stomach . " Please , Marie , " said Quinn . Marie 's expression shifted between anger and exhaustion , and suddenly she was sobbing . She grabbed the handkerchief from Boyle . " I wo n't have you at the funeral , " she repeated to Quinn , wiping at her eyes . " You do n't belong there . " Quinn wished he could argue with her , make her understand why he had never visited , never called Teddy up to see how things were going . It was like they had started playing a game of you-first , and time passed and they forgot it was a game , and now Quinn was the only one left and it was no fun to play anymore . He had to look away , but seeing the glaring blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing the pain in Marie 's face . He kept his eyes down , noting the thick roll of the lawn , the neat beds of yellow tulips bordering the house . Teddy loved order and precision , saw them as a barrier against the ragged chaos of the world . Marie stared at the crumpled handkerchief in her hand , then handed it back to Boyle . " I know you , Officer . " She looked surprised . " You were the first one to arrive this morning . Sergeant . . . Boyle , is n't it ? You were very helpful . Where did you disappear to ? " Boyle worked his jaw . " Deputy Chief Feyse took over the scene , and I " ? he swallowed ? " well , he suggested I take up a station outside . " " I was sitting with Jean Cheverton when you walked in the front door .  | It seemed like only moments since I had dialed 911 and I saw you and thought , who is this disheveled man in my living room ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing to apologize for , Mrs. K. Not after what you came home to . Not many women could have kept it together the way you did . Men neither . Men are worse , most of them fall apart like a two-dollar watch . You , you 're one cool cucumber . " " I was wrong about you , Sergeant . The officers who arrived later were the ugly ones  --  all these bright young men and women bustling through our home in their rubber gloves , chattering away as they worked , talking about television shows and sports scores . " She dabbed at the corners of her eyes . " Not you , Sergeant . I brought you to the kitchen , and you stayed in the doorway , taking it all in , and when you saw . . . when you saw Teddy , you crossed yourself . " " No , m'am ? " " Do n't be coy with me , Sergeant . " Marie stamped her foot . " I roomed with a Catholic girl at Stanford , Mary Ellen Byrne . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I saw you . No one else , not one of all those people who saw my husband 's body . . . who touched my husband 's body , made the slightest show of respect . It was all words from them . Sorry . " My condolences . ' Words , just words . " " Is there anything I can do for you , Mrs. Krammerson ? " " Yes , Sergeant . " Marie laid her hand on Boyle 's arm , and Quinn could see that she was shaking . " You can walk me to the house . I 'm very tired and there is so much to do . " Boyle patted her hand with his paw . " Stay here until I get back , " he told Quinn as they walked away . " You wait . " " Marie ? " called Quinn . " Did Teddy ever mention a man named Joe Steps ? An old friend , he 's in a wheelchair now . " She did n't even look back . Quinn waited , just like Boyle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then started after them . He imagined Teddy walking across the wet grass in his bare feet , wriggling his toes . Teddy had grown up in an asphalt world ; he used to say a lawn was the ultimate luxury . When he got to the rear of the house Quinn saw three cops standing around the patio , drinking coffee from Styrofoam cups and talking . A female officer wearing a white forensics smock and disposable surgical booties sat on the brick barbecue eating a sandwich , taking dainty bites . Her feet swung back and forth as she chewed , the knees of her trousers smudged with dusting powder . The conversation eddied as Quinn strode among them , heads turning  | toward him . He nodded familiarly to the female forensics officer . The crusts had been cut off her sandwich , which was thick with alfalfa sprouts . " Anybody seen Boyle ? " he asked , wanting to cut off any questions about who he was and what he was doing there . A bull-necked sheriffs deputy grunted something about Boyle and they all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from them , edged closer to the sliding glass doors . He could see into the dining room , saw a broken pine sideboard and chairs smashed to pieces . A forensics crew worked a grid pattern search on the floor , squatting on their haunches to avoid the strewn broken glass . It hurt to look at the room  --  Teddy was so particular about his things , hating any kind of waste or sloppiness . Quinn tried to remember the last time he had seen Teddy . It was over a year ago  --  they had lunch at a Mexican tacqueria far from the courthouse . Teddy was the only Anglo regular , the only one in the restaurant wearing a three-piece suit . They ate fish tacos laced with jalapeios , washed them down with bottles of Dos Equis , busying themselves eating and drinking . Teddy had to loosen his tie from the heat of the hot peppers . It was a good time . They fought over the check . Teddy won . They never saw each other again . Quinn blinked as the conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with one of the uniforms over the way Teddy had died , his voice drowning out the rest of them . " The judge was shot at close range , right , Arlene ? " Quinn heard a woman 's voice  --  it must have been the forensics tech ? say something about powder burns and the lack of a contact wound , " six inches maybe , " she said , her voice as dainty as her nibbles , " no more than a foot away . " Quinn winced , seeing Teddy staring into the barrel of a gun , waiting for the hammer to fall . He moved along the back of the house until he was facing into the kitchen , a large room ablaze with the high-voltage lamps the medical examiner used . There was red spray paint on the walls  --  at least he hoped it was spray paint . There were words , but it was hard to read in the glare from the spotlights . " A foot away , " repeated the deputy . " Then the judge was n't the big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Any man with the balls God gave him , has to make a grab for a gun that close . Has to . If he do n't , he 's a pussy , a flat-out pussy . " Quinn turned and stared at the deputy , wanting to shut him up . Teddy was past caring , but he was n't . " Give it a rest , Millikin , " Arlene said to the deputy . " You do n't know what you 'd do . None of us do . " p 55 Quinn could see a chalk outline on the tile floor of the kitchen , a small puddle of blood outside the chalk border . Such a small stain . Quinn had seen more blood when he cut his thumb laying carpet in Katie 's bedroom . " I know I would n't stand there waiting to catch a slug like a B-movie zombie , " said the deputy . " The judge did n't make a move on the shooter , did he ? He just took it , did n't he ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Arlene said wearily , " but it looked like the bullet strike was direct to the forehead , as opposed to a glancing shot . " " So ? " " Which would indicate that the judge was stationary at the moment of impact . " " What I tell you ? " crowed the deputy , " Judge went down without a whimper . Christ , you would n't see me taking it like that . Like I 'm a good little boy and grateful for it . I 'd go out kicking and screaming and it damn straight would take more than one round to put me down . " Quinn 's fists were so tight that his fingernails left marks in the palms of his hands . He tried to relax , to turn away from the yellow chalk outline in the kitchen , but he could n't . He stood there . All that chrome and copper , polished so bright . . . it made his eyes water . Teddy loved being in the kitchen  --  he had to learn how to cook after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he liked creating a recipe , liked filling a room with good smells . Quinn remembered looking up from his plate , mouth stuffed with steak and fried onions , and seeing " Teddy smiling , happy to watch him eat . This was the kitchen where Teddy had fixed breakfast for himself yesterday , French toast maybe , the kitchen where he brewed his strong coffee with two spoons of sugar . . . and last night , while Quinn was pissed off , waiting for him to show up for Katie 's recital , this is where Teddy had died . In the living room , Quinn could see Marie sitting on a pale-yellow loveseat next to an older man with chiseled , patrician features . That room must have already been vacuumed and dusted , neither of them were wearing surgical smocks or booties . The man wore a dark blue suit , his legs crossed at the knee . He was n't a cop . He looked like money and power , a man who would own a white Rolls . Marie sat fingering her wedding band @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had slapped the hell out of him a few minutes ago . She seemed frail now , her shoulders slumped . Quinn wished she had let him comfort her  --  it might have done them both some good . The man patted Marie 's arm , head nodding sympathetically . He saw  | something on his shoe , absently wiped it on the loveseat , still nodding , listening to Marie weep . The man looked directly at Quinn , stared right at him , his face impassive , and Quinn took a step backwards , not knowing why , feeling somehow that he had just lost an argument . There was something faintly familiar about the man  --  a distant memory , not so much of his face but of his manner , the conflicting signals he sent : concerned and contemptuous as the same time . Quinn kept trying to remember . " Maybe the judge was a tough customer once upon a time , " the deputy said , interrupting Quinn 's train of thought , " but he forgot where he came from , living the soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Irish crystal . Well , his fancy crystal is all over the floor ; it did n't help him . He 'd have been better off packing a piece . That 's what I do . On the street , on the crapper  --  if you see me , I 'm armed and danger-ous . " Quinn stared at the ruined white walls of the kitchen , trying to ignore the deputy 's bluster . Quinn had been lying in a white room the last time he had seen Teddy , lying doped up in the hospital after almost being beaten to death by Emory Roy Liston , a psychotic ex-football player . Quinn had drifted along in that white bed with the sheets tucked in too tightly , dreaming of Liston , the sheer enormity of him , seeing those huge fists raining down . He had cried out in his sleep , opened his eyes and saw Teddy sitting in a chair next to the bed , holding his hand . Quinn had tried to speak but Teddy was already fading , until all that remained was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone . The nurses said no one had been in to see him , and Quinn had dismissed it  --  a missed opportunity , one that would never be made right . He squinted into the kitchen  --  he could read the words on the walls now , see the dripping red swastikas . What had Teddy gotten himself into ? Whatever it was , Quinn was going to find out . It was the last promise he would make to Teddy . " You tell me how the hitter got in , Arlene , " demanded the deputy . " There was no forced entry . The hitter rang the bell and the judge invited him inside , just rolled out the red carpet . How stupid can even a judge be ? " Quinn was moving across the patio before he was aware of it . His first punch split the deputy 's lip , snapped back his head in a spray of blood . The next one caught him under the eye , sent a jolt of pain through Quinn 's knuckles . Someone grabbed him before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quinn from behind , holding him in an p 57 iron grip against his soft belly . " No fair , champ , " he whispered . " If any-body 's going to knock the shit out of Millikin , it 's gon na be me . " The deputy stood unsteadily , clutching the air for support , trying to focus his eyes . The other cops watched . One had his hand resting on the butt of his pistol . Arlene was hiding a smile behind the last of her alfalfa sprouts . " You 're okay , are n't you , Milly ? " said Boyle , leading Quinn off the patio . " Big strong guy like you ai n't gon na let some civie cold-cock him . Word gets out , you might as well strap on some tits  --  no offense , Arlene ? and put in for meter maid . " The two of them started up the hill . " I told you to stay put , " grumbled Boyle . " You want to end up in jail ? I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . " Quinn was walking so fast that Boyle could barely keep up .  | Joe Steps could see blue sky and thick white clouds through the canopy of jacaranda branches that overhung the swimming pool . Purple blossoms floated past , tickling his hair , grazing his shoulders as he backstroked slowly through the warm water . He had planted jacaranda trees when he built the house , thinking their fragrant tropical blooms a perfect complement to the Spanish-style architecture , with its rough stucco walls , high ceilings , and rounded doorways . By the time he got out of prison the trees had grown tall and tangled , a riot of glossy leaves shadowing the pool , roots cracking the adobe walls that surrounded the house . Joe had sat beside the pool , and had actually considered having the trees cut back . No . The backyard was his own private jungle , and he was of an age when he did n't like to see wild things brought to heel , carved into shape . Let nature run amuck . He was n't going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and precise , hands slightly bent as they entered the water , pushing it down his sides . Foam floats around his ankles kept his legs up . He could n't kick . His knees and ankles were too swollen and stiff with arthritis . No complaints . He kept his chin up as he swam , watching the morning sky flow through the trees . A lap pool was a rarity during the early sixties when every architect in California was committed to those useless , kidney-shaped monstrosities , But Joe had insisted . He had always loved swimming , and loved it even  | inure now  --  the weightlessness , the fluidity of movement , the freedom . It was as close to dancing as he could get anymore . The pool was kept at a steady 88 degrees , the gas heater running constantly to keep it at bathwater temperature . Mornings were best for him , the water soothing his knotty , swollen joints , allowing him some semblance of mobility . I ie closed his eyes , floating among the flowers . He had once danced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had worn a big orchid in her hair , and moved so lightly that he could have lifted her with a smile . ' I'he house had been closed up for almost thirty years . Renovations had amounted to more than twice its original construction cost , but it was worth it . Broken windows were replaced , hardwood floors polished , the walls and ceilings freshly painted . He kept the original fixtures and as uch of the furniture as possible , comforted by their evocation of good mes past . The handrails in the bathrooms were new . So were the ramps the front and back porches . The house . Their house . He had bought it for her  --  intending it to be a rprise , a celebration of their new life together . It was a nice place , with large kitchen , just a few blocks from Seal Beach , close enough to smell a orm coming in . Plenty of room there for the two of them . Plenty of room for some kids , too , sooner rather than later . She would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dancer , but she had all the right moves . With slim , anyway . That 's what she said the first time they danced together , his and fitting perfectly into the small of her back , her cheek on his shoulder they glided across the floor . Everything between them was easy . Love ost of all . Ile rolled his shoulders as he swam , the water warm as tears . They never got to live in the house . He had kept the pool drained and c property vacant while he was in prison , not because he thought he could ever get out , but because he could n't stand the idea of someone tie living there . He had a hefty bank account when he was sentenced , the interest alone was more than enough to keep up the taxes . Bicycles whirled down the street , children racing to the nearby school , whooping it up . Joe smiled . The sound of kids laughing , yelling . . . he issed that sound more than anything else those long years in prison . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two kids flipping baseball rds against a front stoop , arguing over who was closest . You ca n't buy vthing that good . 1 he morning sun went behind a cloud as jacaranda petals rained down to the swimming pool . He remembered sitting on the veranda of the  | Beverly Hills Hotel , watching a Monarch butterfly hovering over the beds of red carnations , making thousand-dollar bets with Hyman Kipp on which flower it would land on . After losing eight thousand dollars , Hyman had accused him of training the butterfly as he angrily scrawled a check . Thirty years later , the incident still made Joe smile . Hyman was a very wise man , who had made a fortune in penny stocks . He should have known that nobody could train a butterfly . The idea was ridiculous . Painting selected carnations with sugar water . . . that was no problem at all . Joe touched the edge of the pool , slowly turned his body 180 degrees , his knees and ankles already beginning to throb , and started back the other direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a boy  --  the littlest hustler , a beanpole with big bright eyes trying to mimic Joe 's confident walk . He had changed after his mother left for parts unknown , gotten quieter , angrier . Joe had to cajole him into playing nickel-a-hand blackjack , and Quinn was distracted and had trouble keeping track of the cards . Teddy was worse , wandering through the house slamming doors , throwing her clothes into the trash , shiny , sequined dresses overflowing the garbage can like Christmas decorations . The three of them would get together soon , the Three Caballeros , back for an encore . He had called Teddy at his judicial office last week , said he was downstairs in the lobby  --  Teddy was silent so long that Joe thought he had hung up , but then he finally said he 'd come down . Teddy got tears in his eyes when he saw Joe in the wheelchair . Joe told him to can it , said he would n't mention that Teddy had gotten fat if Teddy would n't treat him like a cripple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a good grip . Joe heard his doorbell ring and lifted his head , listening . It could n't he Quinn or Teddy , they would call first . Hugo was supposed to pick him up this afternoon , and he never came by uninvited . A breeze stirred the surface of the pool , sending the purple blossoms skittering to one side . Joe shivered in the warm water . Early morning was the perfect time for a house call . That 's what t:he pros called it . He heard the bell again . The good ones always rang first , they never barged in . They liked to see if you were alone , check out the terrain . Using the doorbell established a formal pace , a rhythm . Once you set the rhythm , you could control the flow of events . The best of the pros were dancers , cheek to cheek with Death . The only way to survive was to avoid the expected : establish your own rhythm , take control of the dance Lead or follow . Joe paddled toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible . He heard footsteps going down the front steps , crunching along t ho  | gravel path leading to the backyard . The back was completely hidden from the street by the adobe wall , but the gate was old , the lock not meant to keep anyone out . Not anyone who wanted in . Joe swam faster , splashing now , not worried about making noise , angry at his helplessness . As a convicted felon he could n't own a gun . He was forced to trust the good intentions of his fellow man . He heard someone rattle the gate as he reached the end of the pool . l le unsnapped the floats from his ankles , pulling himself up the steps and onto the concrete apron , hand over hand . His chest was scraped raw by the rough concrete as he crawled to his canes . The canes were heavy , steel tipped . All he needed was a moment 's hesitation from the pro , seeing this old wreck who wobbled in front of him , knees swollen to the size of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with some of the most dangerous bastards on the planet . He used his wits , his quick reflexes , his charm . Win a pack of cigarettes off a con playing dominoes , you offer him a smoke from that same pack , light it for him . You still cover your back . You keep a shank handy . The gate shook harder as he reached his canes , pushed himself upright . The tip slipped on the wet cement and he banged one knee . Stifling his cry , he pulled himself up again , water dripping around his flopping , inturned feet , as he waited for the gate to be knocked off its hinges . The air was sweet , the sky so blue . Joe flung open the gate . Balanced on one cane , he hooked the other around the startled man 's ankle , tripping him , sending his clipboard flying . He drove the steel tip of the cane against the man 's throat , leaning to it , crushing his windpipe . Water dripped off Joe 's bathing suit onto c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The man 's eyes bulged as he slapped futilely at the cane , trying to Speak . He was wearing a beige uniform with an embroidered nametag , " Chris . " He was young  --  pimples on his chin and braces on his teeth . Joe lased up slightly on the cane , leaning closer to hear what the man was trying to say . " Please , " the man hissed between gasps , " do n't hurt . . . " Joe lifted the tip of the cane from his throat and the man rolled onto his side , weeping , gasping for breath . UPS was stenciled across the back f his uniform in big letters . Joe could see a large , brown-wrapped package beside the gate . " You have ID ? " demanded Joe . Still curled on the ground , the UPS man rubbed at the red welt on his roat.  | Joe limped to the gate . His own name and address were on the pack age . Return address : the California State prison at Vacaville . The Depart ment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and papers he had n't been able to carry out when he was released . The UPS man got to his feet slowly . " I . . . uh , do n't need any ID , " said Joe , offering a hand . " Sorry . We ... we 've had some break-ins around here . " The UPS man nodded , not meeting Joe 's eyes , then staggered crif toward his truck .  | Jen waited until they were back at her apartment before confronting inn , instead allowing herself to doze in the open Jeep on the ride back from the judge 's house , feeling the gritty wind rush past like a bolt of in raw silk . She waited until after her long bath  --  Quinn scrubbing her back with he loofah , then climbing into the tub with her , rubbing away a week of roping on the cold ground from her neck , kneading out the kinks . She suddenly leaned back , pushing him over backwards , the two of them wrestling now , laughing , water sloshing over the sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today he was totally abandoned , one and gripping the edge of the tub as he leveraged himself deeper inside her . His passion was more than not having seen her in a week . He was Inning from Teddy 's death , trying to keep ahead of his fears . She coyfed his hand with her , pushing against him , until their cries echoed off K pink tile walls , leaving them panting , still entwined in the cooling watcr . She waited while he dried her off with a thick towel , kissed the blisters p her feet , whispering how much he had missed her . She almost asked him then , but he had already buried his face in her breasts , and his lashes were tickling her nipples . It felt too good to interrupt . She put p a gauzy pale green robe , then waited until she had brushed out her  | hair while he lay on her bed , a towel around his waist , watching . . then she asked him . " What did Boyle mean ? " " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass top , seeing him in the large oval mirror . " As you were getting back into the car , he walked around to my side , leered , and said , You got a dirty fighter here , miss . Watch yourself in the clinches . ' What did he mean by that ? " He plucked at the towel , a big fluffy one stitched with HOTEL SPLENDID in blue letters . She had taken it from a Beirut hotel last year where the towels were the only thing that qualified as splendid . " Quinn ? " " I punched out a cop . A deputy sheriff with a big mouth . " She dragged the brush through her thick hair . " That was intelligent . " " I was in an intelligent mood . " He pulled at the towel , avoiding her eyes . " Teddy 's wife told me she does n't want me going to the funeral . She said I was a bad son . " He shrugged . " Maybe she was right . " " How would she know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't need her permission . " Jen 's hair was damp against her neck . She brought a handful to her face , sniffed  --  she could still smell woodsmoke , even after shampooing twice . Lots of split ends . She picked up the cut-glass bottle of perfume , sprayed her throat , then opened her robe and sprayed again , the cool mist making her shiver . " Come to bed , " he said . Afternoon light slanted through the closed blinds  --  she was n't going back to work today . She turned away from the mirror , went over and sat beside him . " What 's wrong ? " She laid her hand on his chest . " I always feel this tension , this undercurrent of frustration inside you . It 's like something is chasing you . " She could feel his heart beating against the palm of her hand . " Too much talk radio . " He pulled her down on top of him , held her close , her hair swinging against his face . " I 'll cut back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was acutely aware of the fifteen-year distance between them at this moment , seeing the wrinkles around his eyes , the deep laugh lines framing his mouth . Usually he appeared younger  --  there was a bounce to him , an energy , a brightness that radiated youth . Not today . Not now . It was more than fatigue and the gap between them was more than years . She took his face in her hands , wanting to protect him from whatever it was that was after him . She kissed him . " Maybe you should take some time off after the funeral . "  | " I do n't want to take some time off . " He lay back , stared at the cracked ceiling . " I 'm tired of people being beaten to death with baseball bats for not yielding the right of way . I 'm tired of kids being shot because they shoplifted a can of pop or wore the wrong color bandana . I 'm tired of mothers killing their babies and husbands killing their wives , and customers killing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tired . I see a shoe by the side of the freeway , just an old sneaker , and my mind fills with terrible thoughts . . . I 'm tired of people dying , Jen . I 'll never get used to it . " " That 's why I love you . " She smoothed the worry lines out of his forehead with her fingertips . " I did n't talk to Teddy for months at a time , and when I did we had nothing to say . " He wiped at his eyes . " Now that he 's gone , I miss him . " She touched a fingertip to his cheek , drew a wet X on her heart . Neither of them spoke . A breeze clattered the blinds . Horns beeped in the distance . " I was only ten years old when my father died , " Jen said . " I used to go to his repair shop every day after school and we 'd talk about math class and movies while he showed me how to rewire toasters and record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his immaculate work bench in his white shirt and tie , wielding a soldering iron like a surgeon . Such beautiful hands . Leonard Takamura never got to go to college , but he dressed like the professional man he had hoped to be . " When he died I was sure it was because of something I had done , some way I had let him down . That did n't make any sense , either , but that 's the way I felt . " " Maybe I did let Teddy down . " He swallowed . She could see gray hairs sprinkled across his chest . " I tried to help Marie , but she wo n't even talk to me . I do n't blame her . What did I ever do for her ? I saw her inside the house with this older man ? " " Fontayne . His name is Ellis Fontayne . " Quinn looked at her . " I know that name . .. " " He 's a top defense attorney , " said Jen . " Semiretired now , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil rights and opening up educational opportunities . " " He 's supposed to be on the short list for the next Supreme Court nomination , " said Quinn . " I thought he looked familiar . . . " He shook that idea off . The sight of Fontayne in Teddy 's living room this morning had triggered memories older than newspaper photos of potential Supreme Court justices . He wished he could remember where he had seen him before . " Are you sure that 's who he is ? " " Sergeant Yamada told me that was Fontayne 's Rolls parked across the  | street from Teddy 's house  --  Yamada called in a traffic cop to write him a ticket for illegal parking . Yamada hates defense attorneys . The better they are , the more he hates them . " " I did n't like Fontayne either , " said Quinn . " Nothing definitive . . . he wiped his shoes on Teddy 's sofa . There was such contempt in the way he did it . " He sat up , " What would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He and Teddy must have been friends , " said Jen . " Sergeant Yamada said Marie called him first thing this morning . " " He made it over fast , too , did n't he ? You should have seen Fontayne on the sofa with Marie , drying the widow 's tears . " " That 's what friends do , " said Jen . " Marie 's a very attractive woman , " said Quinn , not hearing her . He rubbed his forehead , his eyes masked . Jen watched him , wondering how they ever got together , glad that they had . They were so different . She was precise and logical , an exacting scientist in the darkroom , factoring exposures in her head . She didn ' believe in intuition . It led to sloppy work . Quinn was n't troubled by such rigorous standards . He operated by impulse  --  punching a police officer ? and instinct , trusting his feelings , without regard for the consequences It worked for him , though , she had to admit it . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fontayne and Teddy 's wife . Quinn rolled over onto his stomach . " I wish I had taken down the license off the Rolls , I 'd run his address ? " " 957 PRW . " Quinn nodded . " That 's right . You 're a high-school dropout with a pho tographic memory , speak four languages , Mensa member since fourteen ? you do n't go to meetings but you still get the newsletter . " " Thirteen , " corrected Jen . " I was thirteen . " " Obviously I 'm not bright enough to make it into the Brainiac club . " " That 's okay . " She slapped him on his bare ass and he yelled . " You have other charms . " She could see her red handprint on his white but tock . He grabbed for hr and she slapped him again , left a fiery matching print on the other side of his beautiful ass . " That hurt , " he said , leaning into her . " I 'm sorry . " She brushed her lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giggling . He yelped , straddled her , pinning her arms over her head . " If it hurts so bad , what 's that ? " she asked , nodding at his rapid ! stiffening erection . He slid his tongue deep inside her mouth , slowly releasing her arms  | le stayed on top of her , pinning her hips against the bed , the two of them tangled in the green robe . He caressed her belly with the back of his fingers . " Have you ever thought of living in Paris ? " She laughed . " Sure , let 's go to Mars . " " Venus , " he said , rubbing his cheek against her ribs as he slid toward Dr navel . " I was just thinking . Paris might be nice . " He slid his tongue to her belly button and she giggled . He kissed his way lower , inhaling Dr fresh , soapy , female smell . " I talked to Napitano . He seemed .. . amenable . We could rent separate apartments if you want , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is . We could live right next door to each other , get a place with an adjoining bath  --  you know how tired I get , showering by myself . " She lifted her leg slightly toward him , and he laughed , catching her . What 's in Paris ? " She jerked as he lightly kissed the inside of her thighs , ling her pelvis against him , eyes clenched shut , feeling his warm breath . " Us , " he whispered , his face between her legs . " We 'd be in Paris . " The of his tongue touched her . " It 's a great place to be in love , that 's what I 've heard . " She moved slightly closer to his tongue . It was an involuntary act , she is sure of it . " I like being in love right here . " She cupped the back of his Dad in her hands , rocking against him as he caressed her , and she was aring at his hair , arching double as his hands slid up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to buck him in deeper but he was holding back and she was clawing at him , and he was right there , and she felt Dr head snap back , rolling against the pillow as he drank her up , and she 1s biting her lip to stop herself from crying out how much she loved him , td then she could n't stop , and what she was crying out was n't words byway , none that anyone could understand , none that anyone but he could . When she came back , when she came back to knowing where she was , hen she could open her eyes , she saw him lying against her hip , a carry , opalescent smile on his face . She reached down and pulled him up to her , the two of them holding ich other , innocent hearts beating a lullaby . Ile wrapped his fingers in hers . " Paris would be a good place for a honeymoon ? " She pressed his lips shut with a finger . " Let 's not wreck it , " she whispered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married would wreck us ? " " Shhh . Last night you saw Rachel and Katie , today you want to get arried . " She played with the hair on his chest , yawning . He smelled  | good , smelled of salt and sex and she wished she was n't so sleepy . " Some men are bachelors , swinging singles , rogue males . . . you , you 're a family man . You want to tuck the kids in bed at night , wake up next to the wife in the morning . My God , " she laughed , " you carry a little Band-Aid in your wallet in case Katie cuts herself . " " What 's wrong with that ? " " Nothing . Not a thing . " " I love you , Jen . We could be a family . " She stroked his hands , strong hands , not at all like her father 's .. . she lightly touched the knuckles , knowing she had to give him an answer . " Jen ? " " I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not now . " He looked pained . " You think we have all the time in the world ? " He gripped her shoulders , trembling now , the shaking running through the two of them . " Not now , you say , but now is all we have , right now , right this minute , that 's all we 're sure of . Teddy and I put off seeing each other ? next week , next month , next birthday . Well , sometimes you do n't get a second chance . " Jen took his hand from her shoulder , kissed his open palm . " You 've got a very strong lifeline . " She yawned , curling against him , feeling him stroking her hair as she drifted into sleep . " A very long lifeline . "  | Jen slept beside him , her breath warm on his chest . Quinn wished he could stay . He gently untangled himself , quieted her mumbled protests with a kiss , tucking the sheets around her . She pressed his pillow against her belly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did n't leave immediately he would be pulled back into that beautiful warm bed with her . He checked every window in her apartment , made sure they were locked , then closed the door behind him , turning both dead bolts with his key . The mid-afternoon traffic on the freeway was still light . Another halfhour and the pace would crawl , the air turning a carcinogenic orange in the sunset . Not now . He made good time , driving hard , tailgating slow drivers in the fast lane  --  he still could n't outrun his anger with himself . For the last three months Jen had turned down his suggestions that they live together , saying she was n't ready , that she needed her privacy ? what made him think she would be willing to marry him ? He tromped the accelerator , cutting off a blue Camaro , staring down the driver . Go ahead . Pull over . Jen should have said yes . At least to Paris . The two of them in Paris . . . the four of them actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . Rachel might say she had n't decided to take the job offer yet , but he knew better . She and Katie were going . He gripped the steering wheel , gunning the Jeep . Horns blared in his wake .  | He jabbed the twentieth-floor button in the elevator of the SLAP magazine building . The other three people in the elevator edged away from him as the floors passed . He glimpsed himself in the burnished steel surface of the door  --  windblown hair , rumpled suit , wild eyes . His face was scratched . He could n't tell if it was from Marie 's smacking him this morning or Jen 's lovemaking this afternoon . The editorial offices crackled with activity : writers hunched over their computers , phones propped against their ears as they tapped away . Napitano would be on his tenth espresso by now , making decisions , snapping his fingers at the laziness and stupidity he saw surrounding him . He told Quinn once that he did n't really enjoy firing people , it was just one of life 's sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their acknowledgment of the Medical Board resignations . Madalyn , the new fashion editor , gave him a round of solitary applause . She had almost died from a botched appendectomy . Her bill included the charge for the original surgeon , plus the second one who had to clean up the first one 's mess . He hung his jacket over the back of his chair , rolled up his sleeves , and logged on to his computer , scrolling past the messages . Joe 's number was n't in the phonebook , but Directory Assistance had him listed . It must have rung twenty times before he picked it up . " Yes ? " Joe sounded tired . " It 's me . Did you hear about Teddy ? " " What happened ? " Joe did n't sound tired anymore . " He was murdered last night . " Quinn could hear Joe breathing on the other end of the line , long deep breaths , steady as the waves hitting the Seal Beach pier . " Joe ? " " I did n't know . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was taking a nap ... " " I 'm sorry . " It was weird . All day people had been telling him they were sorry , now he was saying it to Joe . " Do they know who did it ? " " Not yet . " " I saw Teddy just last week , " Joe said . " We made a start ... " " I 've got a lot to do now , but maybe later . . . tomorrow . . " " Anytime , Slick . I 'm not going anyplace . " Quinn tried Marie next . Teddy 's voice came on the answering machine and he almost hung up . When the beep came , he hurriedly asked Marie to please call him when she got a chance , he understood about this morn-ing . He called the Orange County Superior Court offices , asked to speak to  | Teddy 's court clerk . The clerk , Daronda Washington , was not available , so Quinn left his name and number , said he was Judge Krammerson 's stepson and would like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran Fontayne 's license plate through the Department of Motor Vehicles . He gave the operator his media clearance number , and less than ten seconds later she recited Fontayne 's home address and driving record . He had three vehicles registered , the Rolls Royce , a Jaguar , and a Hyundai . Quinn wondered who drove that . Probably the butler . Fontayne lived at 18 Belford Lane , Balboa . Clean driving record for the last ten years , then two months ago he was cited in a rear-ender . Quinn thanked the operator , sat there tapping his chin . He looked up Ellis Fontayne in the computer database , found 217 separate entries . He started with the " Who 's Who " entry , quickly scrolling down the short paragraphs . Fontayne was sixty-eight . He had looked ten years younger through Teddy 's window . Married , three children . Law degree , Yale , 1951 . Yale Law Review . President of the American Bar Society , 1983-85 . Member of the executive committee of the ACLU . Honored by the NAACP and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights of defendants in criminal proceedings . Argued before the U.S. Supreme Court three times , winning each time . Visiting Professor at the University of Southern California law school . He grabbed his phone before it finished the first ring . " This is Daronda Washington , " the voice on the phone said . She had been crying . " Hello , Ms. Washington , I 'm ? " " I know who you are , " she said . " The judge spoke of you . The judge . . . " she blew her nose . " I 'm very sorry . I was n't going to come in today after I heard . . . then I did n't want to stay home , like I was abandoning my responsibilities . The judge was a stickler . . . but then , you know that . " " Yes . . . of course . " " My heart goes out to you and your family . " " Thank you . The reason I called . . . did the judge have any recent cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the line for several seconds . " We 're not supposed to discuss any of this until the District Attorney makes a formal an-nouncement . " " I understand , " Quinn said , " but the judge 's past caseload is a matter of public record . It would save me some time if you just could tell me yes or no. " 72 FERRIGNO DEAD MAN 'S DANCE 73  | " I . . . I would n't want to get into trouble , " she said . Quinn could hear typing and conversation in the background . " Ms. Washington , anything you tell me is confidential . I would n't want you to do anything that was wrong . " " You could n't get me to do anything wrong . I 'm a Baptist . " " Yes m'am , I understand , Satan himself could n't tempt you to jay-walk . " She did n't laugh , but he felt the tension ease . " I just hoped you could give me a simple yes or no , did the judge try a case recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He nodded as if he were looking at her . He always visualized the other person when doing a phone interview . " I just have a couple more questions , Ms. Washington . " " It 's Mrs. Washington . I 'm a married woman and proud of it . " " I understand . " " I ca n't talk here , " she whispered . " Can you call me back from someplace you feel more comfortable talking ? " Silence on the line . " I 'm sorry to ask this of you , but this has been such a shock , and there 's some concern that other members of the judge 's family might be in danger , and no one will tell me what we 're dealing with . " " I 'd like to help , " she repeated , as though trying to convince herself of something . Quinn 's throat was constricted . " I know you want to do what 's right . I do , too . I wo n't betray your trust in me , Mrs. Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call you back in a few minutes , " she said at last . Quinn heard a dial tone , hung up , and dialed Boyle 's number . The detective who answered said he was off-duty . Quinn tried his home number . Boyle 's wife barked , " Vincent ! " and dropped the phone . Quinn heard someone yawn into the receiver . " Boyle ? " " Quinn ? " Boyle blew his nose . Quinn doubted a Kleenex was involved . " Sorry to bother you , " said Quinn , " but I wanted to know what happened when Fontayne showed up at Teddy 's . " " What happened ? " " How did Marie react ? " explained Quinn . " Did she and Fontayne .. . behave inappropriately ? You have cop-radar  --  did anything about the two of them set you off ? " " You got a fucking sick mind , Quinn , " growled Boyle . " Mrs. Krammerson . . . Marie , that is one stand-by-your-man broad . She did n't even know Fontayne 's phone number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | Rolodex . She said Fontayne was a friend of Teddy 's , and she wanted somebody with heavy juice to come by and keep the department from tearing her house apart . I 'm no fan of Fontayne , but as soon as he showed up everybody inside was on their best behavior . " He laughed . " Assistant Chief Asshole Feyse choked on his Rolaids when the white Rolls pulled up out front . That alone was worth the price of admission . " " Thanks , Boyle . " Quinn did n't feel grateful . The phone rang as soon as he hung up . " This is Daronda Washington . " " Thank you for getting back to me , Mrs. Washington , " Quinn said , disappointed after his conversation with Boyle . " How . . . how long ago was this skinhead trial ? " " Maybe ten months ago , right around Halloween . It was n't much , receiving stolen property , VCRs and guns mostly . The defendant was this surftrash with swastika tattoos on the back of his hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hatch . " Quinn wrote it down . The magazine database kept a one-year record of all state court proceedings . " Did Hatch threaten Teddy ? " " Not out loud . He spat at me , though , when I swore him in . Told me to go back to Africa . You should have seen the judge 's face then , " she clucked , " his eyes got that going-to-the-woodshed look . I know you know the one I 'm talking about . " Quinn did . " Is Hatch still in jail ? " " The judge maxxed him out good . Eight to ten . The prosecutor only asked for two years . The word is that some of his Aryan buddies  --  her voice cracked ? " went to see the judge . " " Thank you , Mrs. Washington . I appreciate it . " " The judge . . . he was like family . " Quinn put the phone down . He doodled on a yellow pad with a pencil , making intersecting circles , big ones and small ones , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe Steps shows up after nearly thirty years , makes plans with Rachel to surprise him at Katie 's dance performance , and that same night somebody murders Teddy . Stranger things had happened , but Quinn was n't a kid anymore . He was suspicious these days . You lived longer that way . Quinn tossed the pencil aside and called the L.A. County Felony Files office . They said Lester was on vacation for the next week . He tried the Orange County office and Romero answered , which was just who he wanted to speak to . There was always a backlog of file requests , and dealing with the usual paperwork could take weeks . " Que pasa , Jesus ? "  | " Quinn ? No complaints , hombre . What can I do you for ? " " I need you to run a check on a Joseph Staducci , aka Joe Steps , double-homicide conviction . I 'm looking for a summary of the court transcripts and complete probation report . I need it by tomorrow at the lat-est . " " About how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check his own memory . " Somewhere around . . . summer , 1964 . " Romero whistled . " Computers do n't go back that far , amigo . I 'm going to have to pull records from the basement . I hate the basement , man . Cock-a-roaches . " " I 'll owe you . " " It 's dusty down there . Cockroaches and everything . I do n't like to get dirty , man , you know that . " " I 'll get you a couple of Rams tickets ? " " Everybody gives me Rams tickets . I wipe my ass with Rams tickets . " " Okay . " Quinn mentally calculated how much he had left on his credit card limit . " I 'll get you a couple of seats to next month 's bantamweight championship bout , Herrera and that other guy ? " " Lopez . " " Lopez . Not ringside , but good seats . " " Why not ringside ? What do you do with your money ? " " Child support . Mortgage on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the mother of your children , man . It 's cheaper . " " You want the seat , Jess ? " " Deal . " " Not yet . I 'm not sure the trial was in Orange County . " Quinn could hear Jess groan . " If you come up blank , I want you to try L.A. for me . My contact is on vacation ? " " No problema , " said Jess . " My cousin Jorge works there . If I do n't find your double homicide , he will . I 'll stick Jorge with your Rams tickets . Jorge loves the fucking Rams. "  | The raw chemical smell burned Quinn 's nostrils as he quietly opened the door to the fiberglass room , but he smiled anyway , seeing Gill Wertham bent over the surfboard he was working on . Quinn released the bouquet of helium balloons he was carrying and held out the six-pack of beer . " Happy Birthday , Gill . " Gill looked up , startled . He was a husky , sunburnt man wearing nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's not my birthday and that 's not my name anymore . " Quinn tossed him the beer . " Relax . " The balloons bounced against the low ceiling , the overhead fan sending them scuttling around the small , stifling room . A poster of Heather Locklear in a bikini was taped to one wall  --  someone had drawn nipplerings on her full breasts . A radio was tuned to that right-wing loudmouth whose sponsors all sold commodities futures or cassette tapes designed to improve your vocabulary . " You could get me in trouble coming here . " Gill checked the closed door . " You could get me killed . " " Give me some credit , " soothed Quinn . " I 'm a Beer-Gram deliveryman who screwed up his order and ca n't remember the name of the birthday boy . I just know he 's some shorthair making boards . I 've been to seventeen surfshops looking for you ; I was about ready ? " " Who told you I was glassing boards ? " Gill 's face was streaked with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red and green fiberglass , his nostrils rimmed with fluorescent colors . He looked like a National Geographic cover of an aborigine in warpaint . Quinn examined the surfboard Gill had been working on . " I asked you a question . Who gave me up ? " " I 'm the one who taught you how to hide , " Quinn said lightly , sighting down the length of the board . " What makes you think I 'd need help to find you ? " They had worked together at the Times-Herald a few years ago . Quinn was the star investigative reporter , Gill stuck on the copy desk with aspirations of front-page glory . They had formed a vague friendship , but Gill grew increasingly bitter and erratic  --  following Quinn like a puppy one day , the next day challenging the security guard to a fight for making him show his ID badge . When he was laid off , Quinn assumed they 'd never see each other again , but a few months later Gill called and asked to meet him . Quinn barely recognized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tank top revealed numerous tattoos : dragons and tigers and a busty woman with swastika eyes . Gill said he had decided to infiltrate the White supremacist scene and write a book about it . A best-seller . He saw himself on " Donahue , " talking about the dangers he had faced , the risks he had taken . He wanted to play himself in the movie . He just needed a few suggestions from Quinn about how you went about doing undercover work . Quinn tried to dissuade him , told him it was dangerous , but Gill was adamant . It was n't a bad idea , actually . Beneath its crust of glamour and wealth , Orange County bubbled with resentment , a poisonous stew of rich against poor , color against color , and everyone against the new immigrants on the block . Asians ate the neighborhood cats , warned the locals , Latins brought exotic diseases , and Whites fleeing the rust belt were drunks and child abusers . They all worked too cheap . Under the microwave of sun and smog , the local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Southern California . They did n't wear sheets or burn crosses . They were n't Bible-reading survivalists stockpiling food and fearing Armageddon . Orange County skins were laid-back dropouts in their teens and twenties , surfers and skateboarders and potheads . They were strip-club Nazis spending Grandma 's money on tequila shooters and pussy , tattooed love boys driving VW vans with " nigger-head " gearshifts and " Party Naked " bumper stickers . Orange County skins surfed Trestles in South County all day , p 77 then dropped some D Meth and drove up to Laguna Beach for a little gay-bashing under the moonlight . Quinn had been interested in covering the Aryan scene himself , but he did n't surf , he did n't skate  --  he was too old to pass . He could still teach Gill a few things about slipping into character though , how to talk the talk , how to ease off and slowly gain people 's confidence . Gill got a job at a head shop in Huntington Beach , selling bongs and cherry-flavored rolling papers . He surfed up and down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beach . " After a few months he stopped calling . Quinn had other worries . " How 's the book coming ? " asked Quinn . " You sounded like you were making progress the last time we talked . " " I quit . " Gill 's mouth tightened and he drug his hand across his peeling nose . " There 's another book I might write someday . . . they 'd never print it though . " Quinn nodded , not sure what he meant . " The cops swept the Screwdriver Tavern yesterday . All those little Nazis led out like a line of ducks ? " " I heard . " Gill checked the door again . " You should go . " " The D.A . is charging three of the regulars with murder and conspiracy in the Judge Krammerson homicide . He 's going to announce the arrests at a five p.m. press conference just in time for the six o'clock news . The judge was murdered Sunday night , here it is just Wednesday afternoon and case closed . Fast work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 's what you pay taxes for . " Minute flecks of iridescent fiberglass floated past , prisming the air . " I can hardly breathe in here , " said Quinn . " Why do n't we go outside , crack some of those beers ? " " I can breathe just fine . " Gill stood over the Styrofoam core of the surfboard , slathering on hot acrylic resin , the acrid vapors twisting in the sluggish breeze . " I 'm not trying to step on anything you 're working on , " Quinn reassured him . " This is n't a news story , this is personal . You know how I get ? " " Yeah , you 're a fucking hero . " Sweat dripped off Gill 's forehead onto the surfboard as he worked . " I went to a lot of trouble to find you , " said Quinn , moving closer . Gill jumped back . " Quit crowding me ! " Quinn stepped away . " I just want to talk . " " I know how that works , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I read your stuff in that fancy-ass magazine . " He bent over the board , mouth  | twisting . " Must be nice , working in an air-conditioned office , babes looking up to you like you 're King Shit . . . " Quinn walked over and turned up the radio . " Is somebody listening ? Is that it ? " " You just do n't get it . " Gill smiled . One of his teeth was missing . " You will . Just wait . " " I talked to your mother ? " " My mother does n't know where I live . She does n't know where I work , so do n't bring her into this . " " She 's worried about you . You used to come home every couple of weeks , drop off a sack of laundry and watch TV with her . Now she does n't see you for months at a time , and when you do come by she says you talk crazy . The fumes in this room . . . you might as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a call ? " " You like my mother 's house ? Flowers in the front , nice little lawn . I grew up in that house in Garden Grove , " said Gill , digging furiously at the surfboard with a long , flat blade , smoothing it out . " It 's ruined now , " he hissed . " They ruined it . " The blade tore chunks out of the board , but he did n't seem to notice . " Little Saigon , ' that 's what they call it now . You ca n't read the fucking signs in the strip malls unless you speak gook . There 's more Trangs and Wangs and Changs in the phone book than Smiths . " He glared at Quinn . " You think that 's right ? " " Gill , working undercover is all about assuming a role , taking on another identity , and that can be as much of a danger as being found out . You have to be careful not to internalize ? " " Save the psycho bullshit . " Gill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be my friend , either . I know who my friends are . You came looking for me because you wanted something , not because you care anything about me . " Quinn watched the shiny glass dust motes dance in the air , finally nodded in agreement . " True . " It seemed to satisfy Gill . " One question , then I 'll go . Do you think the Screwdriver suspects killed the judge ? " " Those posers ? " Gill spit . " The Screwdriver is full of frat boys and jocks talking racial purity Friday night and screwing spics and niggers on Saturday . " Quinn stared at him . " You do n't go for dark meat , do you ? " sneered Gill . " No , you stick with sushi , right ? That gook photographer I read about . Is that what you like ? " " That 's what I like . What can you expect ? My mother was Italian . I just look White . "  | Gill shook his head . " I used to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could turn into a real reporter , " said Quinn . " We were both deluded . " He knew Gill . If he had any information , he would n't be able to stop himself from bragging about it . Gill worked on the board for a little while , then stopped . " I went to the Screwdriver once , " he said , a strange smile playing around the corner of his mouth . " Once was plenty . " " Yeah ? " " Yeah . " The smile twitched happily . " They throw you out , is that it ? They card you ? " Quinn shook his head in dismissal . " All this time undercover and you did n't find out anything . " He started toward the door . " Check out the bartender at the Screwdriver , " called Gill . " I figured that would get your attention . Nice lead , huh ? " He popped a beer and beer foam rolled over his hand . " I thought the bartender looked familiar when I walked in  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pinned him . " He took a long swallow . " Dude was a transfer student at my high school . Right before graduation thirty-four kids were busted . This guy was an undercover cop then , and he probably has n't made any radical career moves since . " He shook his head . " The Screwdriver was a bust . Nobody I know ever went there . Nobody serious . " Quinn nodded his thanks . " These people you know ... the serious ones you 're afraid are going to walk through the door . . . any chance they might have paid a visit to the judge ? " Gill squeezed a long belch out . " That would be premature . Things are n't that bad . Not yet . Besides , the cops are just looking for an excuse to come down on us , wipe us out  --  cops probably killed the judge . Give the papers a chance to run some more of their Honor Diversity ' editorials . Tell that to Reginald Denny . " The empty beer can bounced against a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with your own kind . " Quinn smiled sadly . " I 'm still looking for my own kind . " " You are n't looking in the right places . " For a moment Gill looked like the guy who invited himself to sit down next to Quinn in the Times-Herald cafeteria , then did n't know what to say to him . " Gill ... " " Where were you when I got laid off from the paper ? " Gill said bitterly . " Why me ? Why not the Chiquita who worked next to me ? I was hired before she was . " He shook his head . " I loved that job . " Quinn spread his hands . " The county is half-Hispanic . The whitebreads on Mahogany Row probably thought it would be a good idea to have a few people on staff who speak Spanish . "  | Gill spit again . " Race war 's coming , " he warned , " and sooner than you think , rolling in like a western swell before a storm . . . Get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Quinn did n't move . " Maybe I could put a word in for you at the magazine . It would do you good to make some new friends . " " I like the friends I have just fine . " Gill reached for another beer . " I 'd offer you a brew , but how would that look ? You and me . . . I might have to kill you someday . It 's going to come to that , you know . "  | Quinn blinked , allowing his eyes to adjust to the dimness of the ancient movie palace . Thursday , 2:30 in the afternoon , the Rialto Azteca was almost empty , the wheezing of the air-conditioner echoing through the vast twilight space . Cigarette smoke rose from a dozen scattered seats , twisting slowly in the gray projector light . On-screen a handsome young caballero sat astride his horse , reins loose in his hands as he sang sadly to the night sky . The picture was slightly out of focus , the caballero a ghost rider serenading the stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center of the empty back row , mouthing the mournful Spanish lyrics that warbled over the blown loudspeakers . She sat erect , a short , voluptuous woman wearing a black tuxedo jacket and short skirt , dark hair coiled into a knot , three strands of pale coral beads around her neck . Popcorn crunched underfoot as he made his way over . The floor was sticky with decades of snack-bar detritus , layers of ossified sweetness , an Olduvai Gorge of Southern California 's changing de-mographics  --  from smeared bonbons at the lowest , most ancient level , up through powdered Pez and spilled cherry cokes to the most recent age of Inca Cola , sugary tamarind drops and flattened deep-fried churos . He eased down next to her , then quickly stood back up , feeling the seat cushions slashed to bare metal . He saw her nod to someone , turned , and saw a burly bouncer bow his head , the big man slouched in a wicker  | rocker in the far corner of the theater , a baseball bat balanced across his knees . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulging briefcase , settling into the seat on the other side of her . " Little far from the office though , is n't it ? " " I like the atmosphere , and no one from the D.A . ' s office is apt to disturb us here . " " Not without a police escort . " Fifty years ago the Rialto Azteca was the Rialto Coliseum , a Long Beach landmark , a classic movie theater with pink marble walls and Ben Hur murals , its fluted white columns rising past the third balcony . These days the Azteca offered splashy Mexican melodramas  --  today 's feature : Las Passiones de los Muertos ! ? and dubbed gringo action epics . The Roman murals had been painted over , fierce Aztec warriors replacing the proud centurions , a towering step pyramid covering a frenzied chariot race . The plaster columns were crumbling , the cinemascope screen torn in a dozen places , including a neat bullet hole where someone had put a .38 slug through Mel Gibson 's bare buttock in Lethal Weapon . " It was good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guapo , " she said , her voice husky , with just a trace of an accent . " I lay in bed and played it back a couple of times to make sure it was you . Turned off the lights and played it some more . " " Careful , you do n't want to wear yourself out ... " " No danger of that , " she purred , the words rolling with a bosomy resonance . " I have n't seen you in a long time ; we should celebrate . " She held out a large paper cup , her red lip print on the rim pointed right at his mouth . " Taste . Do n't be afraid . It would n't be the first time , would it ? " He was smiling , remembering , as he took a drink and almost choked . " Wh000eee . " He wiped his chin . " What is this , straight vodka with a splash of coke ? " " Watch . " She nodded at the screen . " This is one of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , closed his eyes , and began sobbing . The horse shifted under him . " Que bonita , que bonita esta mi amor perdido , que bonita , " he choked , tears leaking through his silky lashes . As Tina recited the words along with the caballero , her hand drifted onto Quinn 's knee . Quinn had n't seen her in over a year , but her features were as strong and sensuous as he remembered , broad cheekbones and fiery , dark eyes , her lips full , her eyebrows plucked into a thin , sharp arch . Like most of the three hundred or so prosecutors working for the Orange County D.A . ' s office she was smart and aggressive , but there was p 83 a passionate , raw humanity in her that he had been attracted to the first time he saw her in court . Most prosecutors ignored crime victims until they were on the witness stand , treating them like bit players in the complex legal melodrama . Not Tina . She patted them on the back , helped them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defendants ' threatening glares . Rape victims got follow-up phone calls years after her successful prosecutions of their attackers . Families of homicide victims got help with financial-aid forms and letters of recommendation to colleges and trade schools . " What are you looking at ? " " You , " he said gently . " Do n't get me excited , Quinn . Not unless you 're going to finish the job . " Quinn blushed and she laughed . The camera cut away from the lonely caballero to a smokey cantina ? Zapata moustaches and sombreros around the tables while a scruffy monkey sat chained to the rafters , nibbling on an orange . A sultry senorita danced on the bar , ruffled skirt bouncing high , castanets clicking as the cantina applauded . She threw back her head , nostrils flared . " The caballero is waiting for her , " Tina whispered , leaning close , grazing his cheek with her own , her breath sweet with rum . " She promised to meet him before the moon rose , but she ca n't disappoint the wealthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linen suit watched her twirl while he smoked a thin cigar . " The caballero swore he 'd kill himself if she did n't come , but she does n't believe him . " Tina sighed , her teeth sharp against her bright lipstick . " Love is hard . I do n't know how anyone manages it . How do you do it ? " " Mostly it manages me . " " Why do n't you go out to dinner with me anymore ? " she pouted . " You scared of Tina ? " " Absolutely . " Her throat rippled with laughter . " I thought maybe you got married again . . . " Her hand was higher now . " Not that it bothers me . I am not a possessive woman . " She checked her watch . " You covering the judge 's funeral ? It 's almost time . " Quinn shook his head . " Really ? I thought you were acquainted ? " Tina shrugged , crossed her leg . " I would not miss it . Could not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving one of the eulogies , and he likes to see his troops in attendance . That 's what he calls us , you know . His troops . ' " She drank  | from the paper cup . " I have found that men who use military metaphors invariably have small penises . " " And has this been an extensive survey , Ms. Chavez ? " She pursed her lips . " Modesty and professionalism do not permit me to divulge exact numbers " ? she coyly nibbled the rim of the cup ? " but my conclusion is unassailable . " Quinn nodded , waited a moment . " Sarkis is rushing the investigation , " he said lightly . " I saw his news conference yesterday , and that videotape of the Screwdriver bust he played . Pathetic . What 's he running for , Attorney General ? " " Sarkis wanted to make some arrests before the judge 's funeral . You can not blame him . Besides , there was enough to round them up . They have no alibi for Sunday night , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the evidence team found Brazil nut fragments on the judge 's doormat . " Quinn stared at her . " The Screwdriver has all these ball peen hammers hanging from the ceiling , " she explained , " and the bar top is piled with Brazil nuts . " Her mouth twisted with disgust . " Nigger toes , ' the neo-Nazis call them . They sit around drinking , busting toes . The floor is covered with shells . Forensics figures the killers tracked some onto the doormat . " " Any physical evidence that directly ties the defendants to the crime ? Finger prints ? Hair ? Anything ? " " Not that I know of  --  but , it 's not my case . " " I did some checking , Tina . You ca n't sieg-heil in the Screwdriver without spilling beer on an undercover cop . If there was a plan to kill Teddy , the D.A . would have been waiting inside the house with a SWAT team and a camera crew . I do n't care about Brazil nuts on the doormat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill Teddy . " She shrugged . " Sarkis has enough to put them away for a year or two awaiting trial . If they do n't get a good attorney , it may be enough to send them to the gas chamber . The judiciary does n't like to see one of their own murdered . " He could see her smile in the dim light . " It gives people ideas . " A rat ran down the aisle , stopped , raised up on its hind legs , and sniffed the air . " I thought you said nobody from the D.A . ' s office ever came here , " said Quinn . Tina laughed , took another swallow from the paper cup . " You covered my first homicide trial . Remember ? The twelve-year-old gangbanger who made his getaway on a Schwinn . Pee Wee 's Big Adventure . ' That 's what p 85 they called it around the office , a nothing case , but it meant something to me . " " A nothing case ? " said Quinn . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I will never forget how you described me in that article , " she said : " An elegant predator stalking the courtroom , only her absent tugs at her necklace betraying her nervousness . ' " She smiled to herself , fingertips stroking the rough coral beads . " An elegant predator , ' " she repeated , " such a graceful phrase , so knowing . . . " Her hand moved slowly up his leg like a warm little mouse . He removed her hand . " You did n't used to be so shy , guapo , " she said softly . " I 'm seeing someone . I 'm not shy with her . " " Lucky girl , finding the last honorable man in Southern California . I 'm envious . " She sighed . " Maybe it 's my job , but the men I meet are all tainted somehow . You would n't believe the jokes I hear , the grotesque cynicism . . . welfare jokes , dead baby jokes  --  defense attorneys are the worst , much worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You would n't like it . " He tugged gently at one of her long earrings . " They do n't let you lock up students for not doing their homework . " " Well . . . " She tried to hide her pleasure . " If you did n't call me up because you wanted to have some fun , you must need a favor . " Quinn lowered his voice . " I 'm working on a story . Ex-con , just finished thirty years at Vacaville for a double homicide ? " " He should have waited . " She demurely covered a hiccup with the palm of her hand . " Double homicide is strictly a ten-year ride these days . Out in six if you comb your hair for the parole board . " " I 'd like you to put in a request for his prison file . He 's living in Orange County so it 's in your jurisdiction ; they 'll release his jacket to you . I need to see it . " " We all have our needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and he felt his body respond . " How bad do you need it ? " she whispered , her lips caressing his neck . " How bad ? " He leaned away from her lips . " A man with principles , " she clucked , " you 're a danger to yourself and everyone around you . " The theater darkened as the screen cut back to the caballero standing by a campfire , alone under the stars . Quinn could see the flames reflected in Tina 's hot black eyes , half-closed. now , dreamy . " You really get to me , " she said , her voice thick . " Cops fall in love with whores . Prosecutors . . . we like bad boys with heart and soul . I think you are a bad boy who does not know it yet . What do you think ? "  | " I think I need a favor . " " I could use a favor myself . " She tapped a forefinger against her lower lip . " Maybe you should write something nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The campfire blazed on-screen , the theater brighter now , the metal edges of the seats glowing with cold heat . " You reporters call that a stroke piece , ' do n't you ? A stroke piece . . . I like that . " She watched the caballero fall to his knees in front of the fire , head bent forward in defeat . Quinn passed her a slip of paper . " Here 's the ex-con 's name and case number . The sooner the better . " " I want many photos in my stroke piece " ? she delicately drained the cup of vodka , pinky raised to the ceiling , as the caballero reached for his pistola ? " and quotes from admiring colleagues . Make sure you mention how much I owe to the example and leadership of D.A . Barkis . " Quinn nodded agreement . " How about a photo of you and Barkis in his big corner office ? He could even wear his flak-jacket and shoulder holster ? " " A girl has to look out for herself , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case I 'm on the shitlist . You lose a high-profile homicide . . . sometimes you never get another chance . " She stiffened . " I 'm sick of prosecuting burglars who leave their own wallet at the crime scene , sick of domestic assaults where the wife drops charges . I want Barkis to give me a glamour case  --  a celebrity drug bust or a serial killer , a pro athlete caught with a suitcase of kiddy porn . I am thirty-two years old , Quinn , and I am tired of waiting . " Quinn jerked at movement to his right , saw a young couple in the back row kissing , shy kisses , the two of them with their best clothes neatly pressed , a rhinestone pin in the girl 's thick black hair . Tina checked her watch . " I have to go to the judge 's funeral . You sure you do n't want to come ? You can be my date . I wo n't tell your girlfriend . " Quinn shook his head . She kissed him , breathing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch . " She stood up and headed toward the exit . She staggered a bit at first , but soon got her legs under her .  | Hugo felt the ground tremble under his feet as the torrent of eighteenwheelers roared down the nearby freeway , hot air boiling around them . He listened at the door to Stimmler 's tiny aluminum trailer , heard the television buzzing . MTV ? The trailer glittered in the blazing desert sun , windows covered with silvery foil to reflect the heat . A rusted air conditioner dripped water into the sand . The trailer sat behind a cinder-block truckstop on Route 66 , beached in that long stretch of nowhere between Barstow and Las Vegas . He checked the back door of the truckstop , saw weeds and crushed oil cans and a scraggly orange cat hunkered down in the shade under the steps with something twitching in its mouth . Rick tugged at the collar of his wispy , rayon shirt . " It 's a microwave out here , " he panted , red hibiscus billowing around his chest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way they were wearing them this year , the " Mission to Burma " look . " How come you never sweat , Hugo ? Dressed like a Bible salesman and cool as ice . .. " Hugo stood quietly in a dark suit , white shirt and tie , his hand on the doorknob . It was unlocked . They stepped inside , Hugo letting Rick go first so that he could follow and make sure the door was locked after them . Rick was n't so good with details . They were wearing surgical gloves this time , just like Teddy had suggested . Live and learn .  | The man in the recliner lay in the room 's cool twilight , blinking from the flash of noon they had let in . He registered their presence , then went back to watching the ancient black and white television propped on a wooden fruit crate . Stimmler fit the description . He sat in his underwear , bare legs like sticks poking through the blue robe . A nightstand overflowing with pill bottles stood on one side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its thin plastic tube fitted under his nose , hissing . The trailer reeked of pine disinfectant and lilac air freshener , but Hugo could still detect the sharp , underlying smell of rotting meat . Paper bags full of dirty clothes overflowed onto the stained carpet  --  Rick kicked a gray sweater out of his way , got it tangled around his ankle , and had to pull it off , grimacing , his shirt a swirl of red , the brightest thing in the room . " You 're early , " Stimmler croaked , his breathing labored as he stared at the TV , watching girls in white cotton panties writhe around a pimply guitarist . " My probation visit ai n't until next month . " He smacked his lips at the TV . " Look at that ass . She 's shoving it right in our kissers . " He glanced over at them , noticed the surgical gloves . " You from the Health Department ? " No answer . " Oh , shit . " Stimmler licked his lips , looking from one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Oh . . . shit . " Rick mimicked . " Why bother with me ? " The black circles under Stimmler 's eyes were sunk so deep that he looked like a terrified raccoon . " I ai n't even worth your trouble now . " " No trouble , " said Hugo , moving closer , the smell getting stronger as he approached the recliner . Stimmler shrank back . " Who sent you ? " " Take a guess , " said Rick . " Go on . You get one guess . " Stimmler looked from one to the other . " Fontayne ? " " Good answer , " Rick clapped , " good answer . " Stimmler watched Hugo . " Was it Joe ? Did Joe Steps send you ? " " Good answer , " Rick clapped , " good answer . " " Does it matter ? " asked Hugo . " Either way , you 're a winner , " laughed Rick . " We 've got cash and prizes and the take-home version of our game for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my life , " Stimmler said sourly . He touched the air tube in his nose , making sure it was still there . " It 's Fontayne , right ? " " Good answer , " Rick clapped . Whatever was eating Stimmler had started long before the cancer that was killing him now . He was only in his fifties , but he was already used up .  | i Lugo was equally gaunt  --  you could use his ribs for an abacus  --  but he radiated strength , a power that did n't need something mutable as flesh to operate . Rick rooted through the piles of pills on the nightstand , checking labels , knocking bottles onto the floor . Stimmler shifted in his seat , and Rick 's nose wrinkled with disgust . " Wash your hair , asshole , you 're dis-gusting . " Rick held up a box . " Amyl nitrite , Hugo ! " he crowed . " Pop-pers ! " " Put them back , " said Hugo . " They might be missed . " Rick crushed a yellow ampule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . " You 're not my boss , Hugo , you 're my friend , " he said slowly , his voice coming from far away . " Ask me anything , Hugo . Anything . But do n't order me around . " He leaned against the wall , face flushed , hyperventilating . His eyes were dilated , two black holes in his face . You could look in and not see bottom . " Leave one in the box , " Hugo said . " Please ? " " What 's Fontayne worried about after all these years ? " Stimmler wailed . His cheeks were glazed red , stiff as pottery . " Look at me , boys . Who would listen to me ? " " Joe Steps , " answered Hugo . " He listened , did n't he ? " Stimmler squirmed in his chair . " I 'm no snitch , " he said . " Do n't you stick that label on me . What I did was one con squaring things with another . " He licked his cracked lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the steady hiss of oxygen in the trailer , the rattle of the air conditioner , the rock music on TV . It was a John Cage performance : the Black Lung Symphony . Hugo smiled . He wished he could explain that one to Rick . " I bounced from one lockup to another most of my life , " Stimmler said wearily , his voice fading . " Somehow I always knew I 'd end up in Vacaville with Joe Steps . He did n't know me from Adam , but I knew him . I used to watch him in the yard  --  he 'd been inside forever by then  --  he still moved like he was dancing . " " Is that why you talked to him ? " asked Hugo . " He was such a good dancer ? " " I thought I was dying , " blubbered Stimmler . " Prison doctors had chopped most of my lungs out . . . hospital trustee said it looked like burnt toast inside me . " He shook his head . " I should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who knew ? " Hugo handed him a tissue . Stimmler dabbed at his nostrils . There was a raw spot under his nose where the constant airflow irritated the membrane . " I wanted to clear the  | books with Joe Steps before I died . It bothered me , what I done to him . Did n't you ever do something you wanted to take back ? " " Yes , I have , " said Hugo . " There you go , " nodded Stimmler . " It 's the same with me . " " Maybe you waited too long to ask forgiveness , " said Hugo . " All those years . . . that was a long time for Joe to wait . " Stimmler jerked like a marionette . " Joe sent you ? " His hands flopped in his lap , out of his control . " I thought you told me you were working for Fontayne ? " " I did n't tell you anything , " Hugo said . " That was merely an inference you made . " " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still slack with pleasure . He ran both hands through his hair , then checked himself in the built-in mirror , primping his eyebrows with a moistened fingertip . His toilette finished , he turned toward Stimmler , quickly drawing a tiny .22 automatic from under his shirt , racking a bullet into the chamber with one swift motion . You could tell he liked the solid , metallic sound it made . " My turn , right , Hugo ? " " No guns , " said Hugo . " We have to be more subtle with Mr. Stim-mler . " " Well , I 'm not touching that asshole , " grimaced Rick . " Mr. Stimmler . That 's a good one . " Stimmler trembled . " That 's what they call you in court when they sentence you . That 's what the doctors call you when they found something bad . Everybody 's so polite these days when they fuck you . " " I 'd appreciate it , Mr. Stimmler , if you would n't use profanity , " said Hugo . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hugo spread his hands . " Like Rick said , he 's my friend . " " Thanks , Hugo , and fuck you , Stimmler , " said Rick . " Get in line , " muttered Stimmler . He tried to smile but his teeth were chattering . He bit his lip , tears welling up . Seeing Stimmler 's fear made Hugo think of the judge , bleeding all over his wife 's sofa , knowing it was just the beginning and still keeping up with the wisecracks , acting like he was the one with the last laugh . Every breath that Stimmler took was an insult to Teddy 's dying . " You kill him , Hugo , " said Rick . " He smells like dirty diapers . " He sniffed his own shirt . " I 'm going to have to throw away these clothes . " " Not my fault , " said Stimmler , " there 's too much sulphur in the water . It was my baby sister 's idea to move me out here after I got released . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be good for me . " He cackled , hacked up balls of black spit . " Look at me . Picture of health , huh ? " " Quit complaining , " snapped Rick . " Think about us ! We had to drive way out here to Bedrock to find you  --  no good radio stations and the car I swiped had a broke air conditioner . Look at what the dry air 's done to my skin . " Rick kicked the recliner . " I 'm going to have to double-moisturize when we get back . " He kicked the recliner again , reached over , and turned the valve on the oxygen tank . The hissing stopped . " Hey , " Stimmler reached for the valve , clawed at Rick 's glove . " Hey , come on . " " Give him back his air , " Hugo said to Rick . " And Mr. Stimmler , you give him back his watch . " Stimmler grinned feebly as he pulled Rick 's paisley Swatch from the sleeve of his robe . Rick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " He was more delighted than angry . " Professional secret , " Stimmler gasped as Rick opened the valve of the tank . " I always had quick hands , " he said , his yellowed nails waving an intricate finger-ballet . " I 've slowed down some , " he said to Hugo . " In the old days you would n't have seen me . Joe Steps never felt a thing when I made my move that day at the racetrack  --  I barely touched his wrist and it was like his watch jumped into my hand . I was good . That 's why they did n't kill me  --  Liggett wanted to , but Fontayne said no , they could use me . Fontayne . . . he could talk the birds out of the trees and into a cage . " " Can you teach me that watch trick ? " asked Rick . Stimmler jerked a thumb at Rick . " Nice kid , " he said to Hugo . " I had a punk like him in Soledad . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his mouth . " Happiest year of my life . I still miss him . " Hugo sat on the arm of the recliner and Stimmler flinched , his bravado suddenly gone . " I 'm not a brave man , " whimpered Stimmler , wrapping the blue robe around himself . " Sometimes I think I been waiting for the shit to hit the fan my whole life . " He glanced at Hugo . " Sorry . Never had long to wait , either . " He adjusted the airhose in his nostrils . " It 's getting late , " said Hugo , " and Rick needs to go home and mois-turize . " " You young guys , " gulped Stimmler , " killing does n't mean anything to you . People might as well be cockroaches . " " That wristwatch trick , " said Rick , " does it work with Rolexes too ? "   " Sure , " said Stimmler . " Sure , kid , I can show you . Just takes a little practice , that 's all . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on sleight-of-hand from the public library , " said Hugo . " I w-want my music box back , " stammered Stimmler , " the one I gave to Addie . This one I got now ai n't the same ? " " What 's he talking about , Hugo ? " " You boys do n't know anything , do you ? You 're hired help , just like I was . Look where it got me . " Stimmler fiddled with his airhose , eyes darting back and forth , looking for a way out of his skull . " I can help you . I can tell you things , important things . Take it from me , what you do n't know can kill you . " " It 's late , Mr. Stimmler , and you overestimate my curiosity . " " Never too late . " Stimmler licked his lips . " I 'm tired now , why do n't you come back tomorrow ? I 'll tell you everything . " Hugo shook his head . " Fontayne took me out in his boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurrying now , feeling his life slipping away . It was n't much of a life but it was the only one he had , and maybe if he kept talking no one would cut him off in mid-sentence . " Three a.m. , the ocean is flat as glass and I 'm seasick , heaving my guts out and Jack Liggett is laughing , cheering me on . You met Liggett yet ? No ? You got something ugly to look forward to , then . " He thought for a moment . " Maybe Jack 's got a visit coming he do n't know about . That right ? I hit the nail ? You two are making the rounds , " he nodded . " I wish you had started with Liggett , that way you could have told me how it went down . What he said . What he looked like when . . . when you ? " " Why do n't you just sit back and relax , Mr. Stimmler ? There 's no need to upset yourself . " " I 'm trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There I was , hanging on to the side of the boat , while Fontayne stands behind the wheel like Captain Courageous , telling me how he 's looking forward to our mutual enterprise , and is n't it a beautiful night ? ' Bastard . " Stimmler had to slow down , gasping for breath . " I threw . . . I threw Addie 's things overboard , just like he wanted , but I palmed the music box . I could n't throw Addie 's music box away . I bought it for her . Only thing I ever gave to anybody that I did n't boost . I loved her . Even after what she done to me , I loved her . You ever love anyone ? " Hugo did n't answer . " Love do n't pay , " said Stimmler . " Take my word for it . " P 93 There was a banging on the door and a woman 's voice shouting , " Neil ! I got your lunch here . Open up ! " Rick pulled out his gun . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone ! " squawked Stimmler , his face silently pleading with Rick . " Go on , git ! " " Suit yourself . " She sounded tired . " Food 's outside . " Rick listened at the door . He looked disappointed . " Tell Fontayne I 'll set up Joe Steps for him , " Stimmler said , voice cracking . " I did it once , I can do it again . " He looked back and forth from Rick to Hugo . " Or tell Joe Steps I 'll set up Fontayne  --  I do n't care who sent you , I 'm happy to help you boys . " " Who are we working for , Hugo ? " asked Rick . " This old fuck has got me all confused . " " Go on out to the car , Rick , " Hugo said gently . " There 's still some sodas in the cooler . I 'll be right there . " Stimmler craned his neck , looking around on the floor . " You seen my music box ? It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Sweetie , but it 's all my baby sister could come up with . You seen my music box ? I 'd like to hear that song . " " I think there 's a root beer left , " said Rick . " You can have it if you want , Hugo . " " Thanks anyway . You take it . " " I want to hear my song , " said Stimmler . The door closed behind Rick . " I never got one break in my whole life , " said Stimmler . " Not one . " He pressed the oxygen tube deeper into his nose . He suddenly felt under the cushion , pulled out a wooden music box . His hands shook as he wound it . He opened the lid and the music tinkled out . Hugo waited until the music box had run down . " I hid Sweetie 's music box for safekeeping , " said Stimmler . " Lot of good it did me . You . . . you ask Joe Steps to give you a listen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it . That 's a real music box . " Hugo leaned over the recliner , gradually shutting the valve of the airtank , while Stimmler stared at him , lips moving soundlessly . Hugo listened to the hissing slow . . slow . . . then stop . Time measured in molecules . Later he would turn the air back on . Now he watched Stimmler squirm in the chair , the recliner tilted back almost horizontal , his hands fluttering like white butterflies in the silence .   Quinn sat on the hood of the Jeep , leaning against the windshield as he watched the party going on at Rachel 's house . Friday night , the nearby houses filled with soft light and television . Music drifted on the breeze , the palm trees shading the street from the stars . He felt the hot metal under him , the engine steaming and overheated , a perfect match for his mood . The Jeep was parked on the street , three houses down from Rachel 's , close enough to get a clear view of the colored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boyfriend , Mr. Saab Turbo , had parked his car all the way up the driveway , like he owned the place . Rachel 's house . Two years ago it had been their house , an elegant old two-story in Belmont Shore , an upscale enclave of Long Beach . She had put up the down payment , but he kept up his end of things . Still did . They had n't been able to sell it after the divorce , no one in California was buying houses anymore . Prices had fallen twenty and thirty percent , and still nobody was buying . The smart money was waiting for another riot , when prices would drop even more . After the divorce , Quinn had moved into the guest house in the back . It was a tiny cabin with a leaky shower and a lumpy sofabed , but living there allowed him to be part of Katie 's growing up . A few months ago , after he got involved with Jen , he had found an apartment of his own . He still kept p 95 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing  --  the way things were going between him and Jen , he 'd be back in the cabin by next week . Another car pulled up in front of Rachel 's . The woman waited for the man to walk around and open her door . Nice frilly white dress getting out , flash of leg . One of her high heels twisted in the gravel and he heard her curse . " Motherfucker . " Her date apologized like it was his fault . Way to go , pal , you got a great future as a husband . He stretched out on the hood , crossed his legs at the ankles . He was wearing boots and jeans and a plain white t-shirt with the sleeves rolled up , the same outfit he had been wearing for the last twenty years . He heard footsteps , and was already turning " Quinn ? " They were on the sidewalk , a couple of gangly teenagers in madras shorts and black leather jackets , no shirt , and green 14-eyelet Doc Martens that laced up almost to the knee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long and floppy on the top . " Quinn ? Wow , I thought that was you . " " Bobby ? " Bobby grinned , pushing hair out of his eyes . Bobby , the neighbor kid who mowed lawns and always ran out of gas , the paper boy who did n't deliver when it rained or was too hot . " This is Gomer . " Bobby indicated the other kid . " Whatcha doing , Quinn ? Checking out the old homestead ? " " Something like that . " " Your wife 's having a party , huh ? " said Bobby , one man of the world to another . " Tough break . " He shook his head . " The doofus with the black Saab is over there all the time . He never stays the night , though . You going to kick his ass ? That 's what I 'd do . " " Kick his ass . " Gomer peered out from a curtain of hair . Bobby patted the Jeep . " I always dug this machine . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He and Gomer guffawed . With their boots and skinny legs and scraggly goatees , they looked like cartoon hillbillies . " This is the dude I told you about , Gomer . He writes for SLAP , hangs out with movie stars and crooks and gets paid for it . " " You know Sharon Stone ? " asked Gomer . " She a real blonde ? " " My lips are sealed . " " What 's that mean ? " asked Gomer . " Is that like dirty ? " " No , man , " Bobby chided Gomer , " it 's journalism ethics , do n't ask , do n't tell . Quinn here almost got wasted a few months ago , working on a story . No shit , Sherlock . " " Wicked cool , " said Gomer . " You ever need some help on a stakeout or something , " said Bobby ,   " just say the word . I 'm carrying eight units of Police Science at the community college . Gomer here is going to join the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubbing his gums with a forefinger . " Your name is Gomer , " said Quinn , enjoying their silly innocence , " and you 're going to join the Marines ? " " Yeah . " " So if you wanted to be a beach bum , your name would be Gilligan ? " " No , man , " Gomer explained , " I want to be a Marine . They get to wear swords , right ? " " Just on special occasions , " said Quinn . " Told you , " said Bobby . Bobby stuck a neatly rolled joint into the corner of his mouth . He snapped open a Zippo with a practiced flick of the wrist , ran the flint across his leg . He took a deep hit . " Quinn ? " Bobby held out the joint . Quinn waved him away . " It 's Hawaiian , dude . I pinched it from my dad 's stash . " " He do n't want to be a bad role model , " snickered Gomer . " Shut up , Gomer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not there , if that 's what you 're worried about . Your wife drove her away this afternoon . Katie was carrying a little suitcase . I notice things . . . practicing my surveillance . " " Thanks for keeping an eye on the place , Bobby . " Quinn heard laughter from Rachel 's steps . Bobby and Gomer passed the fragrant joint back and forth while the palm fronds rustled overhead . " You sure the Marines do n't let you wear a sword ? " Gomer said a few minutes later . He was glassy-eyed now , draped over the Jeep . Bobby pulled at his wispy goatee . " You want to come with us , Quinn ? " He held the roach between his fingertips , sucked it one last time , and tossed it down his throat . " We could cruise Hollywood if you do n't mind driving . " " I do n't think so , but thanks for asking . " " I wish you had n't moved away , man , " Bobby said , solemnly shaking his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . Do n't laugh . You 're not that old . " " Yes , I am . " Quinn watched the colored lanterns at Rachel 's house sway in the breeze as Otis Redding 's " Sittin ' on the Dock of the Bay " rolled mournfully through the twilight . He slid off the hood of the Jeep , checked himself in the sideview mirror , and tucked in his shirt . Party time . Quinn did n't bother knocking . He walked in Rachel 's front door like he still belonged there .   The party rolled around him , Jimi Hendrix on CD , slamming out " Purple Haze , " people in party clothes standing around in the living room , glassware tinkling as they chattered away . Nobody was dancing . What a waste of good music . The woman in the frilly white dress from out front watched him as she sipped her drink . When he looked toward her she turned away , then peeked at him over her date 's shoulder . There was a new painting of Rachel 's in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballerina clothes , tugging at her tights in annoyance , hair falling into her face . Quinn smiled . He had seen Katie do that a thousand times . Quinn spotted Rachel in the kitchen being kissed by Mr. Saab Turbo . She turned her cheek slightly into the kiss . Good for her . She saw him , cocked her head like she was n't sure he was really there . He waved . She waved back . Mr. Saab Turbo turned to see who she was waving to and Quinn was pleased to see his mouth tighten . Not that the man let himself frown . Mr. Saab Turbo played squash , and squash players were good sports . Rachel moved toward him , dodging her guests with a sexy swivel of her hips , then she was embracing him , the two of them slowly spinning . " What are you doing here ? " she bubbled , a little tipsy . He recognized the symptoms . When they were first married , he and Rachel played Presidential Scrabble by candlelight after work . Anytime one of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to take off an article of clothing and drink a glass of champagne . Katie had been conceived shortly after Quinn used " Raygun " for a triple-word score . " Nice dress , " he said , still holding on to her . " A little short , maybe . " He could see Mr. Saab Turbo glowering nearby . " Fun party . " " It was Tynan 's idea " ? she looked around for Mr. Saab Turbo ? " he loves organizing these last-minute galas , I think he keeps the caterers on retainer . " She finished her champagne . " Katie 's at Lucy 's house . They 're having a slumber party . You remember Lucy ? " She was suddenly sober . " I 'm sorry about Teddy . I thought we might run into you at the funeral yesterday ... Katie and I looked for you , but it was so crowded . We saw Jen taking photos ? " " I was n't there . " " You were n't there ? " She looked stunned . " Personal request @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mention anything about that ? " " She had other things on her mind , " he snapped .  | " I 'm not supposed to talk to your girlfriend ? " Rachel looked confused . " Why ? Jen and I get along fine . " " It 's not your fault . " Quinn could see Mr. Saab Turbo wandering off to get a drink . " Monday I suggested to Jen that she and I consider .. . relocating to Paris . " Rachel looked surprised . " I had n't gotten around to mentioning to Jen that you and Katie might be moving to Paris , too , so when you told her about your job offer , it kind of made things .. . interesting when I saw her this afternoon . " " You did n't tell her ? " " It 's my fault , not yours . " " Damn right it 's your fault , " Rachel said . " When are you going to learn ? You and your secrets . . . " She shook her head . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private little code of conduct , you just do n't tell them the truth . " Rachel toasted him with her empty glass . " It 's none of my business . You 're Jen 's problem now . " " I hope so . She was n't too sure the last time we talked . " He looked at her , smiled . " Why is it every time a woman comes to her senses she throws me out ? " Rachel did n't return the smile . This was bad . She took both of his hands . Definitely bad . " I wanted to tell you that I 've decided to take the professorship at the Sorbonne . " " I expected that , " Quinn said . It hurt to breathe . " When are you leav-ing ? " " I think it 's the right decision , " said Rachel . Mr. Saab Turbo was back , carrying a tray of canaps . " Get away from me , " Quinn said to him . Heads turned . " Let 's go for a walk in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen . " I 'll be right back , Tynan , " she called . " I hate that guy , " said Quinn as they stepped outside . " This is my house , " said Rachel , angry now . " You do n't live here anymore . Tynan is very good to me . I like him . " " Right , he has great taste in tiger prawns . " She turned to leave and he grabbed her arm . " Do n't go . Please ? " She disengaged his arm but stayed . " When are you leaving ? " " Three weeks . " He thought at first he had n't heard her correctly . " I thought if we were going to go , the sooner the better . " " What does Katie think of this ? Does she even know ? " " She knows . She 's not happy . " " You 're not going to let that stop you , are you ? " Rachel tapped her foot before answering . Three times meant she was P @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He lost count this time . " Being a parent , " she said tautly , " being a full-time parent means that you sometimes have to do things that your child does n't approve of . Sometimes they have to go to bed early . Sometimes they do n't get every toy they ask for . You get to be the good guy , Quinn . You get to take her for banana splits and tell her stories and buy her pets that I have to take care of . You 've got the easy job . I do n't get to be incommunicado for two or three days while I 'm working on something . ' I have to be here . I have to be here when Katie wakes up in the morning . I have to be here when she goes to bed at night . So yes , Katie is very upset that we 're moving so far away from you . I 'm sorry she 's upset , I 'm even sorry you 're upset , but I 'm going to do what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He said it too quickly to take it back . " You 're not going to make trouble over custody ? " " I said you were right . " They had stopped beside the rose bushes . " I just ca n't believe this is happening , " he said . " I mean , I know it 's happening , I just ca n't . . . " He touched a white blossom and it fell apart in his hand . " I 'm going to miss you , " he whispered . Like it would n't hurt so bad if he said it quietly . " You can visit anytime you want . " Rachel took his hand . " Stay as long as you want . " She wiped her eyes and pulled him along the stone path he had laid when they first moved in , pointing out the pansies and tulips , the rustic cypress swing set , the stone frogs that Katie had named , giving him a tour of the yard as though he had never seen it . A breeze lifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he shivered , rubbed his bare arms , feeling goose bumps . " Something is happening , " he said , interrupting her , the words tumbling out before he could stop himself . She looked at him , not sure what he was talking about . " These last few days " ? he tried to explain ? " I 've been talking to people I used to know . Or thought I knew . " He shivered again . " Some-thing 's wrong ... " " What do you mean ? " " I do n't know . " He shook his head . " There was a woman . . . " He glanced at her . " No , it was n't like that . She 's a prosecutor , a good one , very honest , which can be a real drawback . . . she 's drinking in the middle of the day now , worried that she 's running out of time . " Rachel watched him . " Remember Gill ? The guy who worked at the newspaper with me ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always hanging around my desk , reading over my shoulder ... " " I do n't remember him . "  | " Something 's happened to him too . He 's scared , talking crazy . Makes me wonder . . . maybe I 'm going to look in the mirror someday and not recognize myself . " " Do n't worry , " teased Rachel . " I 'd know you in the dark . Easy . " Quinn blushed . He looked at the big avocado tree in the far corner of the yard . " New bird feeder . " " Supposedly . " She shook her head . " Katie and I stock it with sunflower seeds , but the raccoons loot it before the birds get a chance . " " Mother Nature plays favorites . " He bent down , smelled the flowers blooming wildly around the orange tree . " Thanks for attending Teddy 's funeral . I appreciate it . " " I 'm sorry you did n't get to go . " " I 'll say my good-byes to Teddy in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live , " said Rachel . " All those speeches . . . the judge had a lot of friends . " " Yeah . I saw it on TV . Lot of friends . " He stood up . " Who was that man who gave the final eulogy ? He was a beautiful speaker . " " His name is Ellis Fontayne . " The name left a bitter taste . " He 's a bigtime attorney . . . friend of the family . " The wind had kicked up , sending the Chinese lanterns bobbing , yellow and blue and green spotlights scooting across the lawn . Their private kaleidoscope . " I . . . I better go . " Why do n't you go see Jen ? " said Rachel . She slipped her hand in his side pocket as they walked around the side of the house toward the street . " Bring her some flowers and promise her you wo n't ever do it again . " " You think that will work ? " " It worked on me . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough . " " I gave you so many chances ? " " What are you talking about ? " She punched him in the arm . It was just a little harder than playful . " You are such a jerk , sometimes . " " What chances ? I 'm serious . " " I know you are , " she laughed . " That 's what I mean . " " Tell Katie . . . tell her I 'll call tomorrow . " " I 'm going to miss you . " Rachel stood on the sidewalk with her back to the party . " Even after we got divorced , I used to think . . . " She shook her head , dismissing the idea .   " I used to think that too . . . " She kissed him and they both lingered , tangled up in each other , eyes closed , until they heard footsteps on the porch behind them and broke apart like lovers caught in the act .  | Quinn rang the doorbell twice before he heard movement in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he felt oddly vulnerable standing there , trying to resist the urge to look behind him . He was shaky from his conversation with Rachel , confused by the intimacy that still existed between them . There should be a statute of limitations on feelings . The door opened and Joe Steps sat there , dapper as a bridegroom in his suit and tie . " Quinn ! Come on inside ? " " I should have called ? " Quinn stopped , as the cab driver from the pier walked over from the living room and stood behind Joe , his bony hands resting on the back of the wheelchair . " I . . . I did n't know you had company . " " Hugo is n't company , he 's a friend . Hugo , this is Quinn , the guy I told you about . " " Pleased to meet you , " they both said . Neither of them moved . " I saw you at the pier Sunday night . . . " Quinn started . " I saw you too . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock  --  it was impossible to determine if he was making a simple declaration of fact or a veiled threat . " Joe , were you going out ? " asked Quinn , watching Hugo . " I do n't want to interrupt . I was at Rachel 's and ? " " Hugo is off the meter tonight . I told you , he 's a friend . Now , come on p 103 in , damnit , and close the door . " Joe rolled into the living room and Quinn finally stepped inside . " I 'm going to leave , " said Hugo . Joe spun his chair around and faced them , annoyed . " What is it with you two ? Shake hands , you make me nervous . " Their hands stabbed out toward each other . Quinn felt like he was touching a frozen leather glove . " I 'm glad you came by , " Joe said . " I know Teddy 's funeral was yesterday , but I could n't do it . I did n't belong there . " Quinn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling through the darkness , wind rushing past him . " Me neither . " " You knew Judge Krammerson ? " Hugo asked Quinn . He looked sur-prised . " Teddy was Quinn 's stepfather , " said Joe . Quinn nodded . " Did . . . did you know Teddy ? " Hugo shook his head . " I did n't know the man . I just read about the killing . Terrible . " He sagged visibly , his shoulders like sharp sticks . " I am sorry . " His voice was the same dry monotone , but Quinn knew with a strange certainty that the man 's sympathies were genuine . " Thank you , Hugo . " " That 's better , " said Joe , pleased . " Like I said , you two have more in common than you think . " Quinn and Hugo shifted . " I 'm serious , " said Joe . " That 's how I knew Hugo and I were going to hit it off . The first time I got into Hugo 's cab  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hugo 's got this little hand-made sign taped up next to his hack license : Driver will flip double or nothing for his tip . ' Just like you used to do when you were a kid , Slick , remember ? I 'd send you to the store to get me cigars and you always wanted to go double or nothing for my change . You were one lucky kid . Hugo is lucky , too . I keep trying to get him to play the ponies with me , but he wo n't . Just wants to play for his tip . I do n't understand it . " " I do n't like to gamble , " Hugo explained to Quinn . " Double or nothing is different , because I 'm playing for money I never had in my pocket . You do n't miss what you never had . " " Dumbest thing I ever heard , " groused Joe . " What you never had is what you miss the most . " " Hugo 's right , " said Quinn . " You get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . you can go crazy with hunger . " " I was n't asking for a vote , " said Joe . " I just wanted to point out you two had something in common . "   Hugo nodded . " The reason I stopped by , " Quinn said to Joe , " I thought maybe you and I could go out to the graveyard . We 'd have the place to ourselves . " He glanced over at Hugo . " We could do it another time . . . " Joe smacked the arms of his wheelchair . " Let 's go . " " We do n't have to do it right now , " Quinn said . " Why wait ? Let 's go pay our respects to Teddy . All of us . " " I do n't think so , " Hugo said . " This is a family matter . " " Teddy would n't mind , " said Joe . " It 's okay , is n't it , Quinn ? " Quinn did n't answer . " Fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Besides , Rachel told me about the Jeep you drive  --  that thing would shake my bones apart . Hugo 's got his taxi here , a big cushiony land yacht . " He rolled toward the door , flung it wide . " Come on boys , " he called as he started down the ramp on the front porch , " let 's go see Teddy ! " " Careful , " Joe said as Hugo lifted him to the top of the brick wall surrounding the cemetery . Quinn reached up from the other side and gently lowered Joe to the ground . Joe hung onto his shoulder , his legs unsteady as Quinn took the folded wheelchair that Hugo passed over to him . " You 're breathing hard , Slick , " Joe said , sitting down . Hugo dropped onto the grass from the top of the wall , putting his hands out to stop himself from tumbling forward . Joe hoisted himself up in his wheelchair , craning his neck . " Where is it ? " " I 'm not sure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He pointed toward a low , tree-shaded hill , the crest heaped with bouquets , stacked with floral wreaths . " I can do it myself , " snapped Joe as Quinn started to push him . His hands slipped on the wheels and he cursed , leaning forward for leverage . The wheelchair began moving over the spongy ground , slowly at first , then gaining momentum . Quinn and Hugo looked at each other , shrugged , and followed . Looking at Hugo , Quinn was reminded again of a scarecrow , but there was a peacefulness about him , a bright intelligence in his eyes that belied his grim appearance . He wondered if Hugo was sick with AIDS or some other wasting disease , but there was such a robust , energetic quality about him that all thought of illness seemed inappropriate . If Hugo was sick , it did n't show . " Have you been driving a cab a long time ? " " Not really . " Hugo smiled shyly . He had big , uneven teeth . " Joe 's my   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether we drive or not . I feel had taking his money . " " He would n't pay you if he did n't think it was worth it . " " I expect that 's true , but he 's the exception . " Hugo spoke with a calm formality , a quiet reserve that seemed out of phase with the frantic intimacy of Southern California . No wonder Joe enjoyed his company . " I 'm not sure if I 'm really suited for this job , " Hugo said apologetically . " I make people nervous . Sometimes a fare will get in my cab , then ask to be let out a block later . " " I 've had interviews like that , " said Quinn . They were walking together now across the grass . " People think they want to talk , then they worry they 're going to say too much and get themselves in trouble . It 's not us ? people are afraid of themselves . " " It 's very kind of you to say that , but I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearance . People think I look spooky . Do n't deny it . You do n't have to spare my feelings  --  I 've been told that on any number of occasions and I 've learned to accept it . Not that I do n't appreciate kindness when I encounter it . Your wife , for example . . . " Quinn slipped on a patch of wet ground , caught himself . " I dropped Joe off at her house that first time , walked him to the door . She asked him about me later . . . told him that I reminded her of an El Greco painting . " Hugo shook his head in wonder . " What a lovely thing to say . " " What did you mean , the first time ' ? " Quinn said lightly . Hugo shrugged . " I 've brought Joe over there twice this week . . . I thought you knew . " " No . " " I hope I have n't said anything to upset you . " " No . Not at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Hugo , his eyes sunk so deeply into his face that he appeared to be looking at Quinn from the bottom of a well . " I 'm not much of a conversationalist . " " Could have fooled me , Hugo . " They both flinched as a jetliner came in low overhead , engines roaring , wheels down for its landing approach to the nearby airport : Orange County 's John Wayne International , where a larger-than-life bronze statue of the Duke in cowboy regalia guarded the main entrance . The grass was flattened now , tamped down by the hundreds of feet that had stood there yesterday afternoon : the mourners and the curious , police officers and government officials come to pay their respects , to see and be seen .  | Joe struggled up the knoll where Teddy was buried , breathing hard , hair plastered to his forehead . When he finally reached the top , he did a quick 180-degree spin and waited for them , his face flushed and trium-phant . Quinn walked past him and toward Teddy 's gravestone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a simple slab of black granite inscribed with his name , his dates of birth and death , and the inscription , LOVING HUSBAND , HONORABLE MAN . The arc of Teddy 's life  --  no mention of fatherhood . Quinn stood there wanting to feel something , at least a sense of finality , the knowledge that he and Teddy were beyond arguments and apologies now . . . let forgiveness reign . Instead he stood silenced by the freshness of the gravesite , the ripe smell of dark earth and wilting flowers . " I 'm going , " Hugo said from where he had stopped below the knoll . " I 'll . . . I 'll wait back by the wall , give you two a chance to make your peace . " He backed away . Joe watched Hugo hurrying away , watched as Hugo glanced back , then doubled his pace . He followed Hugo 's retreat down the slope of grass , turned and pulled a large silver flask out of his jacket . " Enough with the sad face , Slick  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He poured a splash of booze onto the grave , took a drink himself . " Teddy loved good Scotch , " Joe said pensively . " That 's all any of us drank in the old days . Scotch , bourbon , maybe a cold Gibson served straight up . A man 's drink . I come out of the joint and all you young guys are wearing earrings and drinking these sweet umbrella drinks the color of Easter eggs . " He chuckled to himself , held out the flask to Quinn . " That-a-boy , " he cheered , his eyes wild in the moonlight as Quinn took a long drink , flask pointed to the stars , " the Three Caballeros ride again ! "  | Rick watched the party wind down from the front seat of the Mercedes 560SL convertible , saw women in slinky Lagerfeld knockoffs and their J. Crew dates saying good-bye to this Rachel babe on the front porch , exchanging hugs in the dim light . Barely 1 a.m. and they were headed home to their fixed char-peis and their adjustable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No sign of Hugo . The breeze caressed his hair . He was glad he had put the Mercedes 's top down . Rick aimed the 9mm at the Chinese lanterns bobbing in the wind , made pow-pow sounds like he had a silencer . Chinese lanterns were terminally lame . Might as well string up a fucking pinata . He flipped the safety of the 9mm automatic off and on , off and on , scratching an itch at the back of his head with the barrel , off and on , off and on . Rick had been parked near the house for a half-hour . If he heard another song by Springsteen , U-2 , or Roy Orbison , he was going in with guns blazing . Blazing . Yeah , he liked the sound of that . Like he was a forest fire or a napalm strike . Guns blazing . Oh , yeah . And , nobody going to put him out once he got going . Rick turned the rearview mirror so that he could see himself . He smoothed his right sideburn with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfectly , the collar hugging the back of his neck and shoulders . No prole gap . His first tailored suit . An Ungaro . Three-button , side-vented ,  | dark-blue cashmere . Soft as love , that 's what the salesman had said . Rick could n't wait to show it to Hugo , maybe talk him into getting one , too . They had plenty of money now , and more coming . They were ahead of schedule . Wait until Hugo found out . Would n't he be surprised . Where was Hugo ? He had said he was going to see Joe tonight . . . a social call , if you could believe that . Couple of pals . Rick had driven by Joe 's place but did n't see Hugo 's taxi . He 'd driven past the pier , just in case . Rachel 's house was a long shot  --  there was no sign of the taxi on her street either  --  but Rick had waited anyway when he saw the party . Rick had followed Hugo and Joe here twice this week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well back , each time driving a different car he had boosted . The Camaro Tuesday had taken forty-one seconds from popping the doorlock to driving it away , the VW Jetta Wednesday took thirty-eight . His record was twenty-three seconds for a 1991 Pontiac Firebird . The Mercedes he was driving now  --  Rick smiled  --  he had n't had to boost . Hugo had told him about the woman who lived in this house  --  Rachel ? said she was really nice , and so was her little girl , whatever the fuck her name was . Rick had seen her talking to Hugo , a real tomboy , scabs on her knees , laughing too loud . Rick did n't like tomboys , he did n't like dinosaur rock , he did n't like not knowing where Hugo and Joe were . Out having fun , probably , living it up to the extent that either of them could , which was n't much . A couple of days ago , Rick had watched Joe Steps trying to show the tomboy some intricate dance moves , the geezer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ironside . Hugo probably was n't even thinking about Rick . He played with the safety of the 9mm , trying to imagine what Hugo could be doing without him . Off , on , off , on . D.O.A. Roulette , that 's what he called it , a little game he played when he was a kid . Donny played , too . Rick taught him . They used to goof around in Donny 's bedroom with his father 's .45 , a big gun that you needed two hands to hold . Donny had made him take out the magazine that last afternoon , blubbering how he did n't want to play anymore . One more time , ' Rick had promised , off , on , off , on , pointing the barrel at Donny 's forehead . How was he supposed to know there was still a bullet in the chamber ? Rick 's ears rang for the rest of the day . Bummer . Rick got probation and a lecture from a lady judge with a zit on the end of her nose . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught , he was sent to the California Youth Authority for three years . Good thing they did n't find out about the other times . They 'd never have let him out . Rick tucked the 9mm between the seats , picked up the Mercedes 's car  | phone , and dialed the 900-number of Psychic Soulmate . He jigged the monogrammed leather keycase in the ignition while he waited through the message tape telling him that the call would cost $12.95 for the first minute and $5.95 for each minute thereafter , and that if he was n't eighteen or older he needed his parents ' permission first . Sure . Give me a shovel , I 'll ask them . " Good evening , sir , " said the pleasant woman on the line . She hiccupped . " Pardonnez-moi , " she giggled , then caught herself . " Do you have a regular Psychic Soulmate ? " " Yeah , but I want to try a new soulmate , " said Rick , still watching the front door of the house . " Somebody who knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our psychics are certified , " said the woman , speaking slowly , like they all did , keeping the clock running . " Princess Adriadica is very ? " " She a real princess ? " " Yes . . . yes , I think so . Yes , I 'm sure of it , " she said , hiccupping . Rick heard paper rustling on the other end . " Put her on , " said Rick . He was on hold a long time . Twenty seconds at least . What was that , four or five dollars for sitting around with the phone next to his ear listening to space music ? Not that Rick was going to get the bill , that was going to Mr. Jack Liggett , owner of the Mercedes and the carphone in it . It still pissed him off  --  Rick did n't like to be made a fool of . " This is Princess Adriadica ? " " You sound like the girl I was just talking to , " said Rick . " Sir , I am your personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " My name , " she said slowly , " is Princess Adriadica . What is your name , and how can I help you ? " " You 're the fucking psychic , you tell me . " " I can sense that you are very troubled . . . " " Totally troubled , princess , " said Rick , impressed . " I got a friend .. . sometimes I do n't know if he really likes me , or just needs me . . . for stuff . " " I understand completely . " Princess Adriadica lowered her voice . " Men can be such pigs . I had this one boyfriend ? " " That 's not what I mean . " " Of course . I understand completely . Just a moment , while I consult my higher self . . . " Rick waited . It took a while . " Your friend , " said  | Princess Adriadica , pausing after every word , " he is very sincere . But shy . I do n't think you have any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rick was relieved . " I sense that you have more questions , " she said quickly . " Yeah ? " Rick thought about it . " Okay . I was thinking of opening a business soon . . . " Princess Adriadica hiccupped in his ear . Rick stared at the phone . " Yes ? Go on , " said Princess Adriadica . She hiccupped again . " Pardon-nez-moi . Go on , I understand completely ? " Rick beat the phone against the dash , flailing away until the case cracked . He smoothed his hair , still breathing hard , watching the people leaving the party , lingering on the front steps . He picked up the 9mm again as this woman came out onto the porch , hugging everyone she could get her hands on . Must be Rachel . No wonder Hugo liked to hang around here . He had never seen her touch Hugo , but that did n't mean she had n't . Rick sat back , flipping the 9mm 's safety off-on , off-on as he watched her , off-on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rachel stepped off the porch and down the steps , walking her guests onto the sidewalk . He jerked upright as she stopped under the streetlight , her face clearly visible for the first time as she waved good-bye . It was the woman in the photograph . The one that the judge had kept by the bed . Rick had picked it up the night they killed him , stared at the three smiling faces , wondering who they were , and what the fuck they thought was so funny . He had n't recognized the tomboy , she was just a baby in the photo . There was a guy holding the kid , a jock with tough eyes and a woman with her arm around him . Rachel . He had slammed the pipe wrench into the photo , shattering it , beating it to pieces , not knowing why it made him angry . Princess Adriadica was n't the only one who was psychic . Rachel turned and walked back up the steps and onto the porch . Nice ass . Rick could see himself reflected in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face like an alarm clock . He smiled at his reflection . What time is it ? Time for fun . He aimed the gun at Rachel 's back through the windshield and pulled the trigger . Safety on . Lucky girl .  | Quinn listened to the faint rush of traffic , the freeway a river of headlights shimmering in the night . He jumped as a plane swooped low from the ocean toward John Wayne Airport , engines screaming as it slowed . He had lost track of how long he had been standing in front of Teddy 's grave . " Hard to believe that Teddy 's lying there under all that dirt , " said Joe . He shook his head . " Seems like yesterday he and I were youngsters , chasing around after life . . . Your mama thought I was a bad influence on him ; she said Teddy spilled more booze with me than he drank with her . " He smiled to himself . " Maybe he did . " Joe fumbled in his jacket , brought out one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a kid . He lit a wooden match with his thumbnail . " Your mother never liked my cigars , either . " " She liked you though . Anybody could see that . I never saw her in the kitchen except when you were coming over . " " Well , we went back a ways , your mama and me . She knew what I liked . " He flicked away the match , bounced it off a nearby headstone . " I introduced her to Teddy , did you know that ? No ? Well , I did . I told Teddy he owed me forever . " Clouds rolled over the stars . " Forever . " " She always wore her best dresses when you visited , Joe . I remember playing in the backyard and hearing her sing in the bedroom , getting dressed and Teddy in the doorway , watching me , just watching me , the  | two of us pretending we did n't hear her singing . I was just a kid , Joe , I do n't even know why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , I used to make her laugh , sometimes that 's enough to make a husband uncomfortable . Or a son . " Joe rested his head against the back of the chair . His grin flashed in the night like lightning . " She had a great laugh . You heard it and you thought you were missing out on something good . " Quinn could see Hugo waiting in the shadow of the brick wall surrounding the graveyard , standing there as immobile as a headstone . " Did my mother ever talk about my father ? " Joe hesitated , shook his head . " Your mama . . . well , when something was finished with her , it was over . " He puffed on the cigar . " I never understood her walking out on the two of you like that . Teddy just gets up one morning and finds a note on the table . He never got over it . " " He was n't the only one . " Joe 's face was wreathed in smoke and sadness . " Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around . Maybe she would n't have left . " " Maybe . " Quinn bit off the word . The wind rustled the trees around them , rippling through the grass . " I missed the wind when I was inside , " Joe said quietly , " missed the way a breeze can stir things up , almost without anyone noticing . " " I saw Rachel tonight . She and Katie have been seeing a lot of you lately . " " Rachel asked me over . . . and I like being there . A kid in the house makes all the difference . Katie keeps asking me what you were like as a boy  --  were you brave when the house made funny sounds and did you always like to tell stories ? " Joe shook his head in wonder . " She 's sharp , like you were , weighing everything she 's told , not taking anything on credit . " " I 've been reading your trial transcripts , " Quinn said suddenly . " I 'm not surprised , " Joe said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things . " " The D.A . had a good case , Joe . A big-time bookie and his bodyguard were shot to death in a warehouse . Close range . Cops found your watch clutched in the bookie 's hand ? " " My watch was stolen that morning at the track , " said Joe . " Sometime between the sixth and seventh races . I liked that gold Piaget , too  --  that 's what they gave to finalists at the Nationals that year . My partner and I placed Second . Should have won . Politics . It 's all politics . " They listened to the traffic sounds , neither of them wanting to speak . " Hard to believe  | there was a time around here when you could stand outside at night and not hear cars , " Joe said at last . " We all used to go for midnight swims at Seal Beach and hardly see a light on shore . Remember that ? " Quinn did n't respond . He was tired of Memory Lane . " You do n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your name was in the bookie 's notebook . Bookies are like accountants , they keep good records . You were supposed to meet him the night he was murdered . You owed him money . " " I owed him money , I never denied that . I did n't kill him , though , " insisted Joe . " I never made it over to the bookie 's . " " You had no alibi ? " " That was n't my fault ! " Joe 's voice had risen , echoing off the marble tombstones . He caught himself , looked away . When he turned back to Quinn , his tone was softer . " Teddy and I had made plans to get together that night . We were supposed to meet the bookie , then go out for drinks and catch a show at the Pantages Theatre . . . Teddy showed up at my house four hours late . I had already called the bookie to reschedule , but he did n't answer his phone . According to the cops , he was already dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " His car had broke down on the freeway after he dropped you off with a baby-sitter . He sat there watching the traffic whip past , waiting for a cop or a towtruck to drive by . He finally hiked out on his own . " Joe shook his head . " I used to think I was lucky . Teddy 's Caddy throws a rod and I lose twenty-eight years of my life . " The air was heavy with perfume . Quinn stared at the piled flowers around the gravesite and wanted to kick them to pieces . " You must have been pretty mad at Teddy , " he said carefully . " He should have gotten to a phone quicker , not hung you up like that . He could have been your alibi . " " It was n't Teddy 's fault , " Joe said . " He blamed himself , though . I think that 's why he never wrote me in prison , why he told you I was dead . " He examined the cigar , then puffed it back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I showed up at the courthouse a couple of weeks ago , " Joe chuckled . " After all those years he was still apologizing . " " Who set you up , Joe ? You have to have some idea . " Joe shrugged . He wrapped his coat around himself . " It was a long time ago . " He swiveled his head , taking in the full extent of the cemetery . " This place looks different than it did on TV . All those bigshots talking about Teddy like they knew him . " " Ellis Fontayne knew Teddy , " Quinn said . " I saw him at Teddy 's house the day after the murder , consoling the widow . I did n't even know who he was at the time . He and Teddy must have been close . "  | " Teddy and Fontayne knew each other , " Joe said . " That does n't mean they were close . " " I 'm talking to Fontayne next week . I 've got an interview scheduled for Monday . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do that ? " " I do n't know . " Quinn was telling the truth . " I saw him sitting in Teddy 's house and something about him was n't right . Being a reporter is a lot like playing poker . . . sometimes you have to play your hunches . " " Be careful . " Joe leaned forward . " Watch yourself with him . " " Why would you say that ? " " Just be careful with him . " " I 'm careful with everybody , Joe , " Quinn said evenly . " You remind me of your mother when you get that nasty edge in your voice . " Joe sat back , happily puffing away on the twisted cigar . " She was a beautiful woman . Fiery Italian girl with waves of thick black hair , and the smoothest skin . Those eyes of hers , " he laughed , " she could give you a look that would boil coffee . " Quinn looked around but there was only Hugo , still waiting , well out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid , and things are n't working out at home " ? he licked his lips , feeling like he was ten years old all over again ? " you make up stories , make up things that are n't real but you hope they 're real , because you want to believe them . . . " " What 's the matter ? " asked Joe . " Joe . . . are you my father ? " Quinn had wanted to ask him the question for as long as he could remember . " I looked at my birth records , but there 's no father listed . " Joe just looked at him . " Are you , Joe ? It would make things so much easier . . . I 'm sorry for Teddy , I loved him . . . loved him as best I could , but I always wished " ? the words burned in his throat , a raw insult to Teddy whispered over his grave ? " I always wished you were my father . " " I wish I were . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were tears brimming in Joe 's eyes . " Sometimes I look at you . . . and there she is , staring back at me . " A single tear slid down his cheek  --  in the red glow of the cigar tip it looked like a drop of blood . " I wish that I had had kids , " he said hoarsely . " Boy , girl , it would n't have mattered . I would like to have seen a piece of myself in someone else 's eyes or mouth or the way they held a fork . I would have liked that . " Quinn nodded , unable to speak , not wanting to believe Joe , still hanging on to the hope that the two of them were . . . family . Another plane  | was coming in for a landing , engines screaming . He imagined Rachel and Katie at LAX , boarding an AirFrance jet , waving good-bye . . . Quinn could feel his life contracting to a hard black lump . Located at the very center of his throat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Highway from Long Beach , keeping to the speed limit , a steady 35 mph . The cool breeze off the ocean rippled his lightly moussed hair . He checked himself in the rearview , smoothed his eyebrows with a forefinger . Some girls in a rusted Mustang beeped at him from the next lane , smiled his way . He waved back , winked at the cute one driving . It was a beautiful evening , the moon coming up over the water tower in Sunset Beach . The tower had been converted into a private residence , with 360-degree windows and a private elevator . It was on the market for two million . Someday Rick wanted to live in a place like that , public and private at the same time , distinctive , classy . It would be nice to look down on the rest of the world for a change . He whipped out the yellow silk handkerchief from his breast pocket , dropped a couple of the amyl nitrate ampules he had taken from the desert rat into the center . The girls in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling to him , holding up a can of beer . He crushed the ampules in his fist , brought the handkerchief to his nose and inhaled  --  the pungent smell twisted through his brain , blood rushing through him like a waterfall . He could hear the girls whooping it up as his head flopped back , eyes wide , his penis stiffening , pushing against the soft cashmere of his trousers . The way the girls were shouting , p 117 he thought for a moment the Mercedes had become invisible and they were cheering his hard-on . The Mercedes thudded over the old railroad tracks at the border of Huntington Beach State Park , and Rick heard something wet and heavy bounce against the inside of the trunk . He was speeding . Blame it on the amyl , which slowed everything down , made you think you could keep up , no matter how fast you went . This was no time to be stopped by a cop . Not that it would n't be interesting . He could see fire rings blazing on the beach to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sand like fucking cannibals , stragglers dragging over chunks of driftwood and lumber stolen from nearby construction sites . Rick hated the beach , hated the sand getting in your hair , and the greasy lotion that clogged your pores , and most of all what the sun did to your skin . The sun was a time machine with one direction only : older . Newport Beach was quiet  --  it was after midnight now , the Ferrari dealerships dark , by-appointment-only real estate offices closed , the neon sign turned off at the Yacht Club . Rick in the morning , sailors take warning . Heh-heh . The girls in the Mustang drew alongside him , beer cans waving . One of them shouted something about a party . He tried to focus , but it was n't easy with the amyl pounding in his head . He took another hit from the handkerchief , eyes rolling back in his head . The girl driving was doing something with her tongue . The other one . . . his head lolled against the headrest . . . the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other one was pulling down her blouse , showing off her tiny white breasts . Rick liked them small . The flatter the better . If he wanted a cow , he 'd have been a farmer . He laughed at his own joke . The girls were laughing , too . The three of them were having a regular party . His cock throbbed like a time bomb . He hit the brakes , cut behind them , and veered off at the Fashion Island exit , the girls in the Mustang turning around , shocked as he waved bye-bye . They looked in pain as he disappeared from view . He knew the feeling . Fashion Island was the most exclusive mall in Orange County , a tiny island of orderly palm trees , artificial waterfalls , and sidewalks scrubbed daily . No litter . No graffiti . No Muzak at Fashion Island , either  --  a pianist in top hat and tails tinkled a white concert grand while taut-cheeked matrons flipped out their platinum cards , serene behind their opaque  | Matsuda shades . The mall was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and salesboys tucked into their soft 120-thread cotton sheets . Rick drove up one of the narrow winding streets overlooking the mall . He was the only car on the road , the Mercedes so quiet he seemed to be gliding through the night . He stopped at the crest of the hill , turned off the ignition , and tilted back his seat . He could see the Svenga billboard clearly from where he sat . The billboard showed two young couples lounging around a softly lit sunken living room , L.A. by night visible through the picture window . Plush leather sofa . Thick white carpet . Matte-black component stereo system . Chrome Hydro-Gym gleaming in the far corner . Glasses of clear Svenga liqueur sweated on the black marble coffee-table . SVENGA : THE WINNERS CHOICE . The couples wore pajamas made of a clingy , sheer material that made you think they were moving even though they were sitting still . One of the men did n't have a top on , his chest smooth and muscular . They were all barefoot , pink-toed , and pedicured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lips , settling back into the seat of the Mercedes , the smell of new leather in his nostrils as he watched the winners at play : the blonde boys and blonde girls , all of them long-limbed and tan , sleek as racehorses . Svenga was his favorite billboard in the world  --  he drove out here whenever he was sad and lonely , to remind himself of the things that money could buy . Rick unzipped his pants , released his penis into the cool night air . He was hardening by the moment , growing thicker . He crushed two more amyl nitrate ampules into the handkerchief and inhaled , one hand wrapped around his penis . The girls lay casually on the sofa , skin peeking out from their clothes , faces slack and loose with pleasure . The boys sat on the floor , heads resting against the girls ' splayed bodies . One boy looked directly at Rick , staring back at him with a little half-smile . " I see you too , " he seemed to be saying . Stars exploded behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wanting to be inside that knowing smile , to be part of that little slumber party , boys and girls together , all of them the same : slick and hard and hot and juicy , creaming with confidence . Rick was squeezing himself so tightly he could hardly breathe . An airplane came in low , red winglights blinking as it descended toward the nearby airport . John Wayne Airport . Remember the fucking Alamo . Rick unbuttoned his shirt , caressed his nipples , wanting to join those  | beautiful boys and girls in that living room , wanting to touch them , all of them , kiss every inch of their perfect skin , brush out their clean , soft hair . He wanted to be a winner too , a winner playing with other winners , smiling sex toys without any thought of love . . . no love at all . He inhaled from the handkerchief . A warm electric current surged from his anus to the crown of his head , sparks cracking from his finger-tips . Love was a lie . He gasped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people said to you when they wanted to fuck you . Everyone wanted to fuck Rick . Not that he minded . Girls were good . Boys were good . What he had with Hugo , though , that was better . No boyfriend games . No girlfriend games . They were friends . Hugo had said so and Hugo never lied . Never . Hugo let Rick give him facials and shampoos and haircuts , but that was as far as it went . Hugo just stared at him when Rick offered more . Not angry . Blank . Hugo did n't have any appetite . Not for sex . Not for food . Not for drugs . Hugo was the ultimate winner . He did n't need anyone or anything , which made his acceptance of Rick all the more precious . Rick did n't press for anything more between them . What he and Hugo had . . . it was enough . It was more than enough . Rick groaned with pleasure as he caught the eye of the topless boy and locked on to his ultrawhite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living room , that clear , clean place where no one lost or died , and the fun went on forever . . . His hand circled his penis , twisting the skin behind the head , faster now . The pain was so hot it burned . The only place it did n't hurt was inside the cool blue eyes of the Svenga boy . Rick 's hips buckled as he splashed the dashboard , but he could n't turn away from that win-ner 's smile . It was after 2 a.m. when Rick saw Hugo 's cab turn the corner onto Joe Steps 's street . He breathed a sigh of relief , scooted down low in his seat , peering out through the steering wheel . He knew if he waited long enough , Hugo would show up to drop off the old man . Then the two of them could go dump the Mercedes and head home . They had a lot to talk about . Rick felt like apologizing and he did n't even know why . The cab pulled up to the curb and Hugo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaned forward . Joe always rode in the back , where he had more room . A big guy in a leather jacket slid out of the passenger side , stepped into the street . Tough guy . Real retro with the engineer boots and tight jeans . He needed a haircut . And a tailor . Hugo helped the old man , carried him  | in his arms up the steps , while the tough guy followed with Joe 's wheel-chair . Rick watched them open the front door and disappear into the house . He could n't move . He just sat there in the Mercedes , trying to make sense of it . He had seen this tough guy before . In the photo the judge kept by his bed  --  Rachel , the kid , and this guy . Little family portrait . Blew them a kiss goodnight . Hugo had killed the judge . . . why was he making friends with his relatives ? Rick could hear a faint scratching from the trunk , but he ignored it . He had more important things to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doorbell had been ringing before she woke up . It said 3:35 on the digital clock beside her bed . She lay there blinking at the ceiling , still half-asleep , trying to remember what time zone she was in . " Jen ? " Quinn 's voice : a loud whisper , pleading . She groaned , remembering , slowly sat up in bed , rubbing her eyes , taking her time . " Jen ? It 's me . " She stretched . Raked her hands through her hair , checking the result in her mirror . She considered brushing her teeth . Not a chance . No way . She hit the hall light , saw the front door partially open , restrained by the security chain . Quinn 's face was wedged in the gap , watching her with one eye . His key was still in the lock . He held up a handful of flowers for her to see . She yawned . " I . . . I know it 's late ? " " It 's early . Too early . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half-face and she thought of the jack-of-hearts . She was wearing one of his t-shirts . It was baggy on her , hanging halfway down her thighs , but with the hall light behind her it would be almost transparent . " Are you going to let me in ? " he said . " I picked up the Sunday paper ? "  | " What 's the matter , Quinn , are n't you going to spend Sunday morning with the wife and kiddy ? " " Do n't be like that . " " What are you doing here knocking on my door ? Did you tuck your little family into their nice warm beds already ? Kiss them on their cheeks ? I guess they do n't need you anymore tonight , that 's why you 're here . " " I told you I was sorry . " Quinn pushed the flowers through the narrow space between the jamb , a fragrant offering . " I was n't completely straight with you about Paris , I admit it . What else ? " She kicked the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open again . The bare green stalks looked ridiculous in his hand . " You did n't admit it , " she said . " You were caught . " " I was going to tell you ? " " When ? After we got a charming little place near Les Halles ? " Her voice was rising . " Something just a short walk from Rachel and Katie ? Close enough so they could drop over for fresh croissants ? " She stopped before she started screaming . No one was worth that . That 's what she told herself anyway . " I was wrong and I was stupid , " said Quinn . " I know you 're hurt , but please ? " " I 'm not hurt , " she insisted , knowing it was n't true . " I was hurt this afternoon when Rachel called , and I was angry when I spoke with you afterwards . Now I 'm just bored . " " I 'm sorry , Jen . " She did n't answer . " Why do n't you let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 'd have more fun hating me up-close-and-personal . " She glanced back over her shoulder . " It 's alright , go back to sleep , " she called to her bedroom . Quinn 's smile dropped . " Is somebody there ? " He jammed his face into the gap , trying to see . " Come on , do n't play games with me . " She started to close the door . " Call me this evening , " she said , lowering her voice , pleased to see his pained expression . " We need to talk about how we want to handle interviewing Ellis Fontayne tomorrow . I put together some background ? " " Is someone else really there ? " He held the door open . His eyes kept trying to see over her shoulder to the bedroom doorway . " I do n't have any excuse for what I did , but I did n't plan to deceive you ? " " Let 's call it a lie . " She kept her voice low . " We 're not lawyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " So when you asked me to move to  | Paris and did n't mention that Rachel and Katie were going along for the ride , to me , that qualifies as a lie . So what else have you lied to me about ? " " Nothing . " He dropped the flower stalks onto the floor , reached a hand through the narrow gap to her . " I did n't intend to lie to you , " he gestured helplessly . " We were in bed and it felt so good to be with you  --  I did n't want to lose you , and I did n't want to lose Katie , and the next thing I knew I was asking you about Paris and I 'm sorry , Jen . I 'm sorry . " That was one big difference between Quinn and the young guys she had gone out with before . He did n't try to downplay the importance of what he had done . The young ones would have squirmed and made excuses and argued that her anger was just PMS or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an easy man to forgive . But she could n't forget why he had lied to her . He was a family man and he wanted to keep his family together . There was no room in that family for her . She did n't want a family even if there was room . Sooner or later it was going to be impossible to ignore that fact . " Jen ? " He held out his hand to her . " Please let me in . " " Remember when we first met , " she asked , " and I told you I never got into physical encounters ? " " Sex , " he corrected . " You said you never had sex with anyone over the age of twenty-two . It 's burned into my memory . " " You remember my reasons ? I said older men got tired too easily and they always have all this junk running through their head , career worries , family worries , erection worries . . . Well , you do n't get tired , " she admitted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You 've got more than your share of psychic debris , though . All this . . . baggage from your past . I travel light  --  two cameras , four lenses . No strobe . Natural light only . I keep my life clean and unencumbered ? " " That 's not the way life is . " " That 's the way it is for me . I make sure of that . You wanted to know how I keep it all together after living in Beirut and Sarajevo and Newark . . . that 's how I do it . I look in their dying eyes , feel every wound that will never heal , every need that will never be met , and I take my photographs , I get the shot , and when the job is done and the photos printed , I let it go . All of it . It 's over and done with . Then I go on to another assignment . " " Is that who I am ? " He pulled back slightly from the door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were , then breaking up would be a lot easier . " " I do n't want it to be easy , " he declared . She could see his Adam 's  | apple bob . " I want it to be so hard you ca n't do it . Give us another chance , Jen . Katie is part of my life , and Rachel too , because she 's part of Katie 's life . " His eyes looked right into her , steady and unblinking and she could n't turn away . " I do n't know what 's going to happen with us . . . I do know that if you close the door we 're both going to regret it . " " What happens if I open the door ? " She could feel her heart beating and was afraid he could hear it , too . " I may regret that , too . " His mouth moved but no sound came out . " I do n't know what I was thinking when I got involved with you , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistake ? " " Do n't talk like that . " Jen hung on to the doorknob . " We should quit now . We 're not ahead , but things are n't so awful that we 'll avoid each other at work . We could still have lunch ? " " No we could n't . I could n't eat . Could n't make small talk . " " You do n't know what you can do ? " " I love you , " said Quinn . She nodded . " Jen ? Please . " " You 're going to break my heart . We both know it . " " No . . " Yes , you are . " He did n't answer this time . She gently closed the door . She waited ten long beats , torturing him a little , imagining what it would be like to open the door and find him gone . Loving him infuriated her . There was no sense to it , and she prided herself on her sensibility . She had a gift for calculation , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . She gave it another ten beats before she slid the security chain off and opened the door , just to prove to herself that she did n't need him . Quinn stared at her , his eyes brimming with tears . " Come on in , " she said , sleepily . " Maybe you can prove to me that I have n't made a big mistake giving you another chance . " As he stepped over the threshold she felt a pain in her heart and knew she should have kept the door closed . Should have let him go . She was just prolonging the inevitable by letting him in . It was so obvious . He kissed her . She closed the door behind him , wishing just once that she was n't so smart , hoping she was n't right .  | Quinn stood on the open-air patio , hands on his hips , taking in the rolling grounds at the back of Fontayne 's oceanfront estate on the Balboa peninsula . The lush lawn was dotted with interconnecting pools , water burbling from one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sending rainbows shimmering through the sultry , carcinogenic morning . All the place needed was a couple of peacocks wandering around flashing their asses at the peasants . " Drought ? What drought ? " Quinn said to Jen , listening to the sprinklers . " Somebody should revoke Fontayne 's EARTHFIRST ! bumper sticker . " " It 's GREENPEACE , and I 'm sure the water is recycled . " Jen stood beside him , her eyes against the viewfinder , taking photos of the grounds . " Sure . " Quinn saluted Fontayne 's sleek , fifty-foot motor-yacht bobbing serenely at the dock . " And the Queen Mary there runs on solar power . " " What kind of mileage does your Jeep get ? " Jen said , leaning over , bracing her elbows on the railing to hold the camera steady , using a slow shutter speed to capture the blur of water geysering from the main fountain . She greeted his silence with a smile , sat down in one of the patio chairs . She was a good winner , but then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jen tossed her black hair so that her neck could catch any faint breeze . She wore a gauzy white top and matching , wide-cut shorts , the waist  | cinched with a black industrial-rubber belt , black welder 's boots halflaced . Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm meets the Road Warrior . He could feel his heart beating in his chest as he looked at her , remembering the fresh smell of her bed . He wanted to bend down and kiss the tiny lobes of her ears but was afraid to break the spell . It was Monday , barely 8 a.m. and Quinn was already sweltering in his jeans and a blue dress shirt with the sleeves rolled up . They were early for their interview  --  traffic had been light for a change coming south on Pacific Coast Highway . Fontayne 's servant , an impassive , older Filipino , glided out of the house and refilled Quinn 's glass from a cut-crystal pitcher . Quinn thanked him , but the man did n't respond , merely turned and shoved the pitcher into a sweating silver bowl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuts cracking and he thought of the Screwdriver tavern , Brazil nuts crunching underfoot . . . Jen rolled her glass of cold juice against her throat , eyes closed , reveling in the sensation . " Maybe we should take the day off ? Why not the whole week ? " She stretched in the chair , arms wide . " We both have vacation time coming  --  we could drive up the coast , check out Big Sur . " Quinn watched the servant leave , then sat beside her , lowering his voice . " I need to find out about Teddy . . . find who killed him . " He was so close that he could see the moist dark hairs along the nape of her neck . " I 'm not saying Fontayne is involved ? " She opened one eye . " Yes , you are . " He looked away , toward the orange and lemon trees that ringed the property , branches drooping , heavy with fruit . " I 've seen Fontayne before . I do n't remember where , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her . " I did n't like him then , either . " " Why do you have to make things so complicated ? " She shook her head . " The police ? " " The police are wrong . " " You saw the TV this morning , " Jen said patiently . Channel 7 had interrupted their weather report with a breaking story , the anchor breathless , flanked by a computer map of Southern California dotted with happy Mr. Sunshines . She said that the D.A . had scheduled a noon news conference , and unnamed sources had told Channel 7 News that he was going to announce the recovery of the stolen van used by the killers of Judge Theodore Kramrnerson . Police had made a positive ID from a license-plate notation in the murdered security guard 's logbook . " The van was abandoned less than a mile from the Screwdriver , " said Jen . " The police supposedly found a matchbook from the tavern on the  | floor . If they get a fingerprint match on one of the suspects , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the police make a fingerprint match , then do we get to go to Big Sur ? " " Anybody can plant a matchbook , " Quinn insisted . " You walk into the Screwdriver , wait for the biggest racist loudmouth to light a cigarette and palm the matchbook they drop onto the bar . Instant evidence . " " You should have been a defense attorney , " a voice said from behind Quinn , startling him . An older man sat down next to him , a wellgroomed , professorial type with longish , silver-white hair and dark , flinty eyes peering over his half-glasses . " I 'd be happy to recommend a good law school . " Fontayne turned to Jen before Quinn could answer . " Ms. Takamura , " he said , shaking her hand with his fingertips , " you have no idea what a pleasure it is to meet you . " Jen smiled back at him . Fontayne was dressed in a pink polo shirt and khakis , brown tassel Loafers with no socks . An old preppie , slender and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair still damp from his shower . His bio said he was sixty-eight , but if it was n't for the liver spots on the backs of his hands he could have passed for at least ten years younger . " I trust your orange juice was satisfactory , " said Fontayne . " George picked the fruit this morning  --  he refuses to strain the juice , says it ruins the taste . " He spoke with a bouncy , melodic inflection , like he was reciting poetry . He looked at Jen , taking in her gauzy white shorts and unlaced welder 's boots . " Ms. Takamura , " he purred , " that is a stunning outfit , and beautifully accessorized , I might add . " " Why thank you , Mr. Fontayne , " Jen said cooly , stiffening at his syrupy compliments . " Ellis . Please , call me Ellis . " Jen held his gaze . " I do n't think so . " Fontayne laughed with his mouth . " You 're tough , " he said appreciatively . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He turned to Quinn , peering at him over his spectacles . " I do apologize if I 've kept you wait-ing , " he said , " but my tennis lesson ran late . I was having a bit of difficulty with my backhand . Ah well , in the grand scheme of things , a weak backhand is a minor character flaw . " " Depends on what stakes you 're playing for , " Quinn said . Fontayne nodded , his fine white hair crowned with sunlight . " I 'd like to express my deepest condolences on your loss , Quinn . I saw you at Teddy 's house that terrible morning , but I did n't recognize you . I wish you had  | come around to the front , perhaps I could have induced Marie to let you in . I can be very persuasive . " " I 'm sure you can . " Quinn could still see Fontayne in Teddy 's living room , wiping his feet on the furniture . The three of them were silent . The only sound the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orange juice with an index finger . " On the telephone you spoke of a magazine article on me , " Fontayne said , uncomfortable with the lack of conversation . Words were like oxygen to him . " I became interested after hearing you speak at Teddy 's funeral , " said Quinn . " A lot of people think you 're being considered for the next opening on the Supreme Court . " Fontayne finished his orange juice . " Many are called , " he said , masticating the pulp with his small , even teeth , " but few are chosen . However , I doubt you 're really here to interview me about my possible appointment to the high court . Is n't that true ? " " You 're too smart for me , " said Quinn . " Time will tell , " chuckled Fontayne . He patted Quinn 's arm . " I think you 've come to see me because you hope to learn more about Teddy . Whatever your reasons , I 'm glad you 're here . It 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the drifting apart . Teddy and I knew each other for many years , but he rarely spoke of you . I hope that does n't hurt your feelings ? " " Just a twinge . But then he never mentioned you , either . " " Teddy was a man who kept his confidences , " said Fontayne . " I never knew what he was thinking . I used to say that Teddy could be on fire , and no one would know until they smelled the smoke . " He crossed his legs , flicked the tassel of his Loafer . " I remember when he first started working for me , fresh out of school , all eyes and ears ? " " Teddy worked for you ? " Quinn was startled . " I assumed you knew , " said Fontayne . " Yes , I gave Teddy his start  --  he learned more law carrying my briefcase than he did in that second-rate law school he attended . I wish he had stayed in my employ longer , " he said , his voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " So am I. " Quinn was n't sure he had said the words aloud . " You 're not at all what I expected , " Fontayne said . " I did some checking on you after your call . Attorneys hate surprises  --  I hope you do n't mind . You have something of a reputation as a hothead , but I do n't see it . You 're a pleasant surprise . " " Do n't be fooled , " said Quinn . " I 'm on my best behavior . " " It 's true , " said Jen.  | Fontayne applauded , his soft hands barely making a sound . " You two are quite a pair . Makes me wish I was young again . " He sighed , serious now . " Quinn , I 'm glad to see you in such fine health . I did n't know if there would be any lasting effects from your recent . . . unpleasant-ness . " " What are you talking about ? " " The ex-football player who almost beat you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What was it , three or four months ago ? Quite a news story . " He adjusted his glasses . " Liston . . . ? Yes , that was his name . You 're fortunate to be alive . " " Yes . " Quinn 's voice was lost . " Is this too painful to talk about ? " asked Fontayne . " I did n't mean to upset you . " " There 's really nothing to talk about , " said Jen . " I read that Liston had thrown you against a wall , " Fontayne said to Jen , " knocked you out . True ? " Jen shrugged . " You regained consciousness , " recited Fontayne , " still dizzy , and saw this enormous thug throttling Quinn . Most people would have panicked , run away , saved themselves . You stayed . " He regarded her over his halfglasses . " You stayed . You picked up the gun on the floor and shot this Liston fellow to death . Remarkable . " Quinn looked at Jen . Lightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is . Fontayne watched them through his steepled fingers . " By comparison , my life has been tame , but I , too , have known love like that . " He stood up abruptly . " Come with me , please . I have something to show you . " Quinn and Jen exchanged glances as they followed Fontayne back into the house . They walked through a long central hallway , past spacious , sunny , precisely balanced rooms , couches and chairs in muted colors , magazines fanned across the coffeetables , walls of pale yellow and eggshell white  --  with all the soul of a doll house . Fontayne threw open the double doors at the end of the hallway , waved them inside . High cathedral ceiling . Massive bookcases . Curtains pulled across the windows . Quinn moved closer to Jen without thinking . The desk was elevated , the worn leather desk chair still carrying the imprint of Fontayne 's head , a ghost attorney dreaming of appeals and arguments . The wall behind the chair was lined with photos of Fontayne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Salman Rushdie , Fontayne and Mother Teresa , Fontayne and each of the last three presi-  | dents . A visitor would have to sit before that desk and stare up at Fontayne in that constellation of nobility . Quinn 's attention was drawn instead to a small , hand-colored photograph on the desk  --  a beautiful woman in a delicate pink ballgown . She stared back at him , one eyebrow arched , idly fingering a strand of diamonds . The rigid pose did n't suit her . " I have a confession to make , " announced Fontayne , " I had my own secret agenda for meeting you both . . . " Quinn turned and saw Jen staring at the wall opposite Fontayne 's desk . Framed photographs covered the dark paneling  --  Jen 's entire South-Central Gothic series , black-and-white portraits of young teenage boys and girls formally posed with their favorite guns . As always , Quinn 's gaze was drawn by " Tyrone , " a smooth-skinned adolescent holding a Mac-11 automatic pistol across his hairless bare chest . He had the calmest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great admirer of yours , " Fontayne said to Jen , " your images of Bosnia , Haiti . . . they made me weep . These , though " ? he indicated the wall of photos ? " your last exhibition , the benefit for Rebuild L.A. , are my favorites . I bought the complete set . " He adjusted his glasses with a forefinger . " Anonymously , of course . " " I took these shots less than two years ago , " Jen said . " Royce , Daryl , and Chaka are in jail . Marbella got married . Phillip is in ROTC . Armand wants to be a police officer . Milton and Tupac are dead . No one knows what happened to Tyrone . " Her voice dropped to a whisper . " He just went out one night and never came home . " Quinn wanted to put his arm around her waist , wanted to protect her , but he knew better than to try it . Not here . Not where Fontayne or anyone else could see . Jen did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to touch her . " You 're my secret agenda , Jen , " said Fontayne . " I hope to interest you in a rather formidable project of mine ? " " The Elena Foundation ? " Quinn said , wishing he had kept his mouth shut , but he wanted to interrupt Fontayne 's offer to Jen , felt compelled to throw himself between the words . Like that would protect her . " Why . . . yes , " said Fontayne , surprised . " I have n't made a formal announcement yet . " He idly flattened the nubby collar of his polo shirt with his fingertips , watching Quinn . " It seems we both have our sources . " The Elena Foundation was a rumor and a wild one at that . Quinn 's contact in the mayor 's office had overheard a conversation : Fontayne was planning to donate the bulk of his fortune , estimated at over eighty million dollars , to educate poor children . p 131 " There 's always a buzz when someone wants to give away a ton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . . . wonder . It makes me won-der . " " Unfortunately , we live in an age when good intentions are suspect , " Fontayne said sharply . " Do n't blame Quinn , " said Jen , " I 'm curious , too . " " I 'm neither a saint nor a fool , " insisted Fontayne . " I 'm not trying to assuage a troubled conscience or buy my way onto the Supreme Court . The explanation is rather prosaic : I have more money than I could possibly need . My wife . . . my wife , Elena , is deceased , my children grown ? I could leave it to my heirs , but inherited wealth debilitates the character . So why not do some good with it ? " Quinn could hear a clock ticking . He wondered who Fontayne was trying to convince . " My wife 's death left something of a hole in my life , " Fontayne said to Jen . " I became quite dependent on her love over the years . " He straightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She died of cancer four years ago . " He smiled weakly . " If I were a philosopher , I might suggest that the Elena Foundation is my poor attempt to cure the cancer that is devouring our society . " He shook his head . " You must forgive me , Jen , I sometimes descend into mawkishness . " " You do n't have to apologize , " said Jen . Quinn watched him , reserving judgment . Fontayne walked to the window , swept back the curtains , and stared out at the vast gardens . " My wife designed this house , and the grounds too . She was a very talented woman , " he said wistfully . " She sometimes complained that I worked too hard , that I did n't take time to smell the flowers . " He smiled at her portrait . " Now all I have left are her flowers , and their perfume mocks me . I can not bear their fragrance . " His eyes were like stones . " I loved my wife very much . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ticking of the clock . " Jen , do you think we decide whom we love , or is love something beyond our control ? " " We choose , " responded Jen . " No way , " said Quinn . Fontayne looked at Jen . " I 'm afraid Quinn is right . " His hand stabbed out as though he had lost his balance . Jen moved toward him but Quinn stayed put .  | It was just after 10 a.m. , when Katie saw this boy walking up the walk . She knew what time it was because " Baywatch " had just gone off . Katie hated that show but Natalie insisted on watching it . Monday was n't Monday unless Natalie got to see a bunch of rich actors running around in red swimsuits pretending to be lifeguards . The whole idea made Katie suspicious about growing up . Adults were bad enough , but Natalie was sixteen , for God 's sake . She was supposed to know better . This boy on the walk was really cute . Like Jason Priestly on " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultimate babes " pictorials , not that she was really interested in boys , unlike her friend Erica who was completely insane on the subject . Natalie noticed the boy , too . She wet her lips as she watched him come up the steps . What a surprise . She had boy-radar . Most of the time she was a really good sitter  --  not a baby-sitter  --  she played games ( although she could n't throw a baseball to save her life ) , she made great grilledcheese sandwiches for lunch , and she brought copies of those weird supermarket newspapers with stories about UFO babies and Elvis frozen on ice . She was the best sitter Katie had . She never treated her like a kid . The cute boy rang the bell , even though he could see them inside , watching him . Natalie walked to the open front door , smiled at him through the latched screen door .  | The boy was wearing baggy polka-dot shorts and a flowered shirt , these weird , clunky black boots and rhinestone sunglasses like movie stars from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't believe he was real . What was somebody like this doing on her front porch ? " Hi , " he said . " Hi , " said Natalie , her voice all low and sultry . Puke me out , thought Katie . The boy took off his sunglasses and smiled at Natalie . Katie felt her mouth drop . She took a step backwards . The boy 's eyes did n't go with the rest of him . They were cold eyes . . . like a dead fish . Natalie did n't seem to notice . She just kept staring at his smile and his cheekbones and his slanted sideburns . " Nice morning , " said the boy . " Y-yes , " said Natalie . " You two ladies are in luck , " said the boy , his head weaving slowly through the air on the far side of the screen door , tilting back and forth like he was checking his reflection in the mirror . " Uh-huh , " said Natalie . " We do n't want any , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Natalie stopped her . " Do n't mind her , " Natalie said to the boy . " What are you selling ? " They exchanged smiles . " I 'm Rick , " he said with a mock-bow , " and I 'm working my way through cosmetology school . " He held up a plastic Barbizon tote bag . " I just spent the weekend in an intensive series of seminars , and girl , I am full of goodies . " " Wow , " said Natalie . " Let 's check it out . " She reached up to unlatch the screen door . " No ! " Katie yelled , her voice startling even herself . Natalie 's hand hovered over the latch . " Natalie , " Katie said , tearing herself away from Rick 's stare , " you know Mom 's rules  --  no strangers in the house , for any reason . " " I 'm no stranger , little girl , " smiled Rick , bending down like she was a midget . " Do n't you want me to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look pretty for the boys ? " " No . " Rick kept smiling . Between him and Natalie , it was like being stuck in the middle of an endless toothpaste commercial . " Well , do n't you want your big sister to look beautiful for the boys ? " He glanced at Natalie . " Not that she needs much help . " " She 's not my sister . "  | Natalie 's hand hovered around the latch . " I really like the Juliette Lewis thing you 've got going there , " Rick said to Natalie , " the perky-pouty-kissible thing . It 's working for you , girl , " he smiled , eyes flashing . Natalie touched her hair , beaming . " You have a real style sense . . . it 's Natalie , right ? " said Rick . " Too many fashion victims fall for that **28;0;TOOLONG look . Not you . That little blunt-cut is perfect for your features , but make sure you deep-condition it , maybe even hit it with some color , bring out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You ever thought of a traverse cut ? It 's just a little slicing technique , encourages forward movement . " He shook his hair , sent it shimmying across his forehead . " See ? " " Pretty , " Natalie said softly , dragging one toe behind her . " What 's your favorite band ? " Rick asked suddenly . " Stone Temple Pilots , " Natalie responded immediately . You 'd have thought she 'd been waiting to be asked that question all her life . " Ex-cellent , " said Rick . " They 're in the studio now , working on a video ? " " I thought they were touring , " said Natalie . " Nope , " said Rick . " They got this video . I may get to help with their makeup . If I do , you could come along . " " Definitely , " squealed Natalie . Her hand reached for the latch . " My father is going to be home any minute , " Katie lied . " He 's not going to like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand off the latch and stepped back . " That 's alright , " Rick said smoothly . " I carry a complete line of men 's cosmetics , shampoos , and rinses . I have plenty of free samples I 'd be happy to leave with you . " He reached into his bag , pulled out a handful of tubes and offered them to the closed screen door . " You want to take them ? I think your dad would like them . You could surprise him , give him a shampoo tonight . He 'd like that , would n't he ? " " I do n't think so , " said Katie , standing directly in front of the door . Natalie giggled . Rick 's face got red . " Fine . I got a good sunblock moisturizer you could give him . Your dad gets wrinkles or skin cancer , do n't blame me . It 'll be your fault . " " Leave them outside the door , " said Katie . " Why do n't you come back later ? " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are here . I 'm sure ? " " I 've got a few more houses to visit before class tonight , " Rick smiled  | at Natalie , " but do n't worry " ? his voice shifted to a Schwarzenegger bari-tone ? " I 'll be back . " Natalie cracked up but Katie did n't say a word . Rick moved closer , looking directly at Katie , his face almost touching the screen . His eyes were so flat and ugly , it was hard to believe they belonged with the rest of him . " You 're a very smart little girl . Careful , too . I bet your mother and father are very proud of you . " Before Katie could say anything he had turned and walked quickly down the steps . Katie watched him hustle down the street , followed him until he was out of sight . He did n't stop at any other houses . " God , Katie , " sighed Natalie , " you are such a baby . That guy was so hot and you ruined it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt to let him in for a minute ? Such a fox . . . " She fluffed out her hair . " He said I looked like Juliette Lewis . You 're my witness . " She shook her finger at Katie . " Someday , when you 're older , you 'll realize what you did , but it 'll be too late . He 's never coming back after the way you treated him . He did n't even leave us any samples . "  | N. sign of Deputy D.A . Tina Chavez . Quinn checked out the broad plaza around the Santa Ana courthouse  --  natty attorneys clustered around the steps , jabbing chili dogs at each other as they argued , faces shiny with sweat in the bright sunshine . Knots of uniformed police in mirror-shades huddled off by themselves , either fresh from testifying or ready to be called to the stand . They stood with their arms crossed , watching the attorneys , their mouths twisted with contempt . The families of the Hispanic defendants had spread blankets on the dry grass under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dresses setting out sliced oranges and mangos , stacks of tortillas , yellow plastic margarine tubs filled with beans and fixings . Old women sat on lawn chairs , fanning themselves , watching the children who scampered between the blankets in their best clothes screeching happily . Quinn was still boiling from his visit with Fontayne this morning ? more angry at Jen 's reaction than anything else . She liked him . She thought he was a charming host . She liked his politics and his bumper stickers and his taste in photography . She said he had an honest face . Where the hell was Tina ? " Are you looking for me , guapo ? " Quinn turned at the honeyed voice , saw Tina standing nearby , hands on her hips . Empty hands . " What 's wrong ? " " I thought you were bringing me Joe Staducci 's prison file . "  | " And I thought you 'd be happy to see me , " pouted Tina , tapping the toe of one of her lilac snakeskin high heels . She wore a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complexion , a tiny gold crucifix around her neck . In any other place than Southern California , upward mobility would have necessitated conservative attire  --  defense attorneys could flout the norms with ten-gallon Stetsons and ponytails , leather mini-skirts and hippy bell bottoms , but city attorneys were usually relegated to varying shades of gray . Not here . The local media loved a certain flamboyance even in its public servants . The district attorney himself , Alvin " Attaboy " Barkis , regularly accompanied the police chief on high-profile drug busts , the two of them decked out in tailored black SWAT jumpsuits for the cameras . " You going to kiss me ? " asked Tina . " It 's alright , I kiss all my friends . If you just stand there , people are going to wonder what we have to hide . " Quinn kissed her on the cheek . " Congratulations , Tina . I was in the back of the courtroom this morning . " " I saw you . " Tina smiled , then shrugged . " Save your congratulations for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She shook her head . " Such a waste . " " Take the easy ones when you get them . " Quinn lifted away a single strand of her hair that had fallen across her face . " Thanks for pulling that file , I really appreciate ? " " Such an eager boy , " said Tina , looking up at him with those large dark eyes . His skin felt hot under her open gaze , and for a moment he imagined the two of them alone in the dark , warming each other with their breath and their slippery bodies . " You just ca n't wait to get in there , can you ? " she said , enjoying his discomfort . " Ca n't wait to dig into the file , be a hero . Judge Teddy would be proud of you . " She waved to someone behind his back . " Let 's get something to eat before we have company , " she said , leading him toward one of the All Beef hotdog stands that ringed the plaza . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . A young hunk in a thong was dishing out the goods . Last year a Cuban-American entrepreneur , " Cubanito " Sanchez , had started out with two All Beef stands , featuring kosher dogs and male and female bodybuilders dressed in the bare minimum . The authorities had filed suit , citing public decency laws , but the entrepreneur had argued the case himself and won . His servers were college students who wore no less than could be seen on a public beach . There was no touching allowed . He was an upstanding member of  | the community trying to find the American dream . To deny him this opportunity would constitute restraint of trade . The judge agreed . The bronze muscle boy handed Tina a hotdog layered with sliced jalapeiios . Her regular , evidently . She paid him three dollars , plus a dollar tip , daintily holding the bun between her lilac fingernails , a perfect match for her shoes . She watched as he turned hotdogs on the grill , flexing for her , showing off his oiled washboard abdominals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bite . " Hola , Chica ! " said a swarthy , thickly built man in a white linen suit , embracing her , kissing her full on the lips . He fanned his lips . " Que picante ! " Tina pushed him aside , laughing . " You know Quinn ? " " Sure , me and Quinn go way back . " " Que pasa , hombre ? " said Quinn . " Business is good , " said Cubanito , eyes narrowing as he kept watch on his other stands . " Be better if you ordered something . " He clapped the bodybuilder on the shoulder . " Whasa matter , Quinn , you no like my Baby Huey here ? If you wan ' , we can go over to Cynthia 's stand . " He indicated a tall blonde showing the muscles of her inner thighs to a trio of admiring attorneys . " She a Physics major , man . She talk these equations and vectors , but it don ' matter  --  your dick still get hard when she slops on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to start franchising , Cubanito , " said Quinn . " The TV commercials will be . . . unique . " Cubanito beamed . Within a month after Cubanito 's court victory , and making money by the fistful , competitors had moved in . None of them lasted . Maybe it was his business acumen . Cubanito hired only college students with clean records , and no desire to supplement his generous salary package with after-hours prostitution . He flew in the hotdogs from New York , had the condiments custom-made locally . He kept careful track of his inventory , right down to the last bun . No one stole from him . Cubanito had spent time in Castro 's worst jails . His prison number was tattooed on the inside of his lower lip . He had eyes that would scare a sewer rat . " This pay as well as dealing coke ? " Quinn said softly , leaning close , Cubanito 's Paco Raban so thick that it stung his eyes . " Speaking abstractly , of course . " " Abstractly . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offering the gods his human frailty and his gratitude . " No , amigo . I 'd be lying to you if I said it did . Cash flow is n't as good , and I got to pay the taxes . " He sighed p 139 at the injustice of it . " Still , I sleep better now that fuckers only try to kill me with a fountain pen . " " Wait until you get your law degree , " said Quinn , " you 'll be wishing you were facing down Uzis again . You are still studying to be a lawyer , are n't you ? " " Three nights a week , man . Making straight As , too . I got another couple years , three max , then I take the bar and give D.A . Chavez here " ? a smile for Tina ? " something to worry about . " His eyes gleamed with a feral intelligence . Drop Cubanito onto an asteroid and he 'd carve a spaceship out of the bare rock and sell it to E.T . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glanced from Tina to Quinn , flashing his new capped teeth ? " nothing that ca n't be expunged , though . This is America , right ? Money talks and bullshit walks . " Tina finished her hotdog , took Quinn 's arm . " Later , babee , " she called to Cubanito , who bowed formally , looking like a southern plantation owner in that vanilla ice cream suit . They walked through the crowd , found an empty bench on the outskirts of the plaza , a vantage point where they could been seen but not heard . Still no sign of Joe Steps 's file . Maybe Tina was going to have one of the passing joggers drop it off when she gave the high-sign  --  a snap of the fingers would be more like it . Tina leaned back , watched a thick white cloud edging across the sun . " This ex-con , this Joseph Staducci . . . you did n't tell me he knew Judge Teddy , " she said lightly . " It was a long time ago . " Quinn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , keeping track . " A long time ago . " Tina smoothed her lip gloss with the tip of her little finger , licked her lips . " So why are you so interested in his prison file ? Are you studying ancient history now ? " " Joe . . . Joe is a friend , " said Quinn . She turned her face to the sky , drinking it up . " So now you investigate your friends ? " Quinn had stumbled into a patch of cactus . He was going to have to be very careful to get out without drawing blood . " Gee , Tina , if I had known I was going to be cross-examined this afternoon , I 'd have worn my good clothes . " " You look fine , guapo , " she reassured him , continuing with the same sweet tone of voice . " This Joseph Staducci wrote Judge Teddy many times from prison , but all of the letters were returned Refused . ' " She crossed her legs with a crackle of silk . " Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They had a misunderstanding . It was taken care of . "  | " Judge Teddy is dead and this ex-con is alive , " said Tina . " Now there can be no more misunderstandings . " " You 're wrong , Tina . " " Perhaps . " Tina shrugged . " And perhaps you are too trusting of your friends . I was the same way when I first joined the D.A . ' s office . I fixed a few traffic tickets , listened sympathetically to every excuse . I thought people were basically good . I did n't even own a gun  --  can you believe that ? Today , if I buy a pack of gum , I count my change . " " You have to trust someone ? " " If you trust this Joe so much , why did you have me pull his file ? You must have had a reason . " The sun had come out from behind the cloud . Quinn could feel the heat in his face like an arc lamp . That 's what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . hard to hide from the big bright light . " I wondered about Joe , that 's all , " Quinn said . " I 've made mistakes before . " It was over two years since the mini-mart killing and he could still see the fear in Doreen 's eyes , hear Groggins 's voice , the gunshots and people crying , still see the sweaty TV reporter shoving a microphone in his face , asking him how it felt . How it felt to have gotten a killer released ? Now that the killer . Had killed . Again ? " Quinn ? " She looked worried for him . He wiped cool sweat off his forehead with the back of his hand . " Do n't worry about me , " he said , grateful for her concern . " I 'm like you now . I check people out . I go through their closets , look under the seat of their car , run a credit check . I had you pull the file because I was suspicious of Joe showing up when he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true . " " Maybe he 's way too good to be true , " said Tina . " Your Joe has a temper . Did you know that ? An old man like him . . . arthritis . . . you 'd think he 'd want to take things easy . " Quinn turned to her . " What are you talking about ? " " After I read the prison file , I made some calls , " Tina said . " The Seal Beach police got a complaint about your Joe . Seems he attacked a UPS deliveryman , scared him half to death . Tough old man for a cripple . " " You 've been busy , " said Quinn . " I did n't think you were interested in Teddy 's homicide . You told me the D.A . had a good case on the little Nazis . " " Our District Attorney Barkis does have a good case , " said Tina . " Not good enough for you , though . Maybe not good enough for me , either . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat on the bench . " To break open a high-profile case like this . . . " Her nostrils  | flared . She was the perfect prosecutor now , driven more by ambition than moral outrage . He liked her better before . Quinn watched a woman sitting under a pepper tree peel a tangerine for her children , her long dress modestly tucked under her legs . Her husband was probably squatting in a holding cell , but she carried on , looking exhausted but happy as she passed out the tangerine slices . " Can you imagine what could happen to Barkis if we prove that he botched the investigation ? " said Tina . " A false indictment in the murder of a sitting judge ? Power can shift so rapidly these days . . . there 's no sense of allegiance or honor . Guapo , anything can happen . " She hummed softly to herself as she contemplated the destruction of the D.A . ' s career . " I knew that sitting judge , " Quinn said quietly , keeping his eyes on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . he was my stepfather . " Tina 's face fell . " Pobrecito ! " She grabbed his hands , clutched them to her heart . " I had no idea . I am so sorry . You should have told me . " " There was no reason to . " She looked hurt . " Of course there was . You did n't tell me this was family . That makes all the difference in the world . I thought your interest was strictly professional . " She patted his cheek . " Do n't worry , guapo . We will find the one who killed Judge Teddy . No matter what it takes . If it is a personal thing for you , it is a personal thing for me , verdad ? " " Tina , do you know Ellis Fontayne ? " " I know of him . He spoke at Judge Teddy 's funeral . Why do you ask ? " " I 'm not sure . Teddy and Fontayne knew each other from a long time ago . I did n't know anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how far the friendship went . " He shrugged , wishing he had more specifics . Of course , if he had specifics he would n't need her help . " Maybe you could ask around the department , find out if any of the older prosecutors knew Fontayne from the old days . " " I will do what I can , but . . . " " Thanks , Tina . " Tina checked her watch . " Court is about to start and I have a couple of dime-baggers we 're pleading out . " She stood up , smoothed her skirt . " The file is at the Information desk in a manila envelope with your name on it . " " Let 's take our time , " he cautioned . " So far all we have are some possibilities . Let me ? " " The two of us working together , " she said , arranging her dark hair with deft swipes of her hand , " that is not so bad , is it ? " " I just do n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traced a heart on his chest with one of her lilac-painted nails . Hard enough to hurt . " You take care of your hopes , I 'll take care of mine . " He watched her hips swivel as she walked away from him . She did n't look back the way she had in the Azteca Theater . She had better things to do now .  | Hugo could hear laughter and music as he climbed the stairs toward his apartment . Every step was an effort , the evening warm and full of ghosts . He had taken side streets from Joe 's , trying to avoid rush-hour traffic , exhausted after spending the day with Joe in one medical office after another , listening to doctors blandly describing the possible " outcomes " of his deterioration . Joe had merely nodded , teeth clenched against the future . Most men feared death , but Hugo knew that death was a blessing . A balm to suffering when pain became unbearable . A companion when there was no longer any hope for friendship . A comforting darkness when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dying . He knew with a certainty beyond all reason that the moment of his death would be of his own choosing . He had known this for as long as he could remember . This knowledge was his most precious secret . Teddy had not been ready for death when Hugo and Rick had stormed into his home . Not then . In the kitchen , though , the blood drying on his apron and Rick sprawled on the floor , holding his bruised face , Hugo had looked into Teddy 's eyes and plucked him like a bouquet of flowers . A cigarette butt bounced at the top of the landing right in front of Hugo , rolled down the steps spilling hot ashes . " Sorry , man . " Hugo looked over to Rick 's apartment . A bored teenager leaned in the  | doorway , dark hair dripping around his shoulders , tattoos covering his arms . He fired up another cigarette , cracked a beer , watching Hugo with the dull eyes of an insect . Inside the apartment , Hugo could see Rick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ martini glass in his hand . Rick had read somewhere that the martini was making a comeback among the hip , powerbrokers of the world . It was n't the drink itself , it was the glassware . Rick was laughing at some joke , gesturing wildly , splashing himself in the process . Hugo walked quickly to his apartment , unlocked the door but did n't go inside . There were four or five people at Rick 's , the rock musicians from A-19 who worked at a juice bar and said that learning to play their instruments would " fuck with the raw purity of their sound . Dude . " Rick caught sight of Hugo . He did n't react , waiting for Hugo to make the first move . Hugo nodded at him . Rick beamed , toasted him with the empty martini glass . Hugo waved , went inside his apartment , and closed the door . He sat on the floor with the lights off , wishing he were far , far away . His life was a series of small steps that somehow had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land of the perpetual party . He still could n't believe it . He wondered what Quinn had wanted to talk to Joe about . It must have been important , the way he looked . Strange to have gone to the graveyard with him , the two of them whispering in the darkness while Joe paid his last respects . Hugo had watched the vein throb in Quinn 's forehead , heard the ache in his voice , and wanted to tell him that he had been with Teddy at the end , that Teddy had not hurtled into death alone , Hugo had been there with him , as close as he was to Quinn . Hugo stayed silent , burdened by secrets . Ten minutes later came a soft rapping on the door . Hugo flipped on the light and opened the door for Rick . " Hi , " said Rick , uneasy , standing there in a sky-blue suit with a yellow shirt and a floppy , polka-dot bow tie , his hair lacquered flat , pulled back into a tiny ponytail . He peeked around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered what Rick had done now . " Hello , stranger , " he said . " I was starting to think you were avoiding me . " " Look who 's talking , " snapped Rick . He suddenly looked like he was about to cry . " S-sorry , Hugo , " he stammered , hurrying inside . " I-I 've been busy . . . shopping . Celebrating . Nothing wrong with that , is there ? " " Are you okay ? " " What do you think ? " Rick turned slowly , posing for him , one arm  | cocked against his side . He flicked the bow tie . " Elegant , expensive " ? his thumbs slid down the blue jacket lapels ? " classic lines , yet with seductive , post-modern accents . " Hugo stared at him . Most of the time , Rick was marginally articulate at best , his speech a mixture of the profane and the uneducated . When he talked about style , though , about fashion , he could spout the most effusive jargon with total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was talking about , but he could n't stop himself from listening . Rick caressed his left ear . " I treated myself to three new studs . Ru-bies . " He tossed his ponytail . " Brings out the red highlights I rinsed in this morning . " " What are you celebrating ? " " Do I need a reason ? " demanded Rick . " You never have , " Hugo said , envying Rick 's giddy embrace of pleasure , his manic enthusiasm for fun and feeling . Rick did n't need a reason to celebrate . Or an excuse , either . Rick was a beautiful boy snagging dragonflies on a lazy summer morning , tearing off their iridescent wings and braiding them into his hair . A lord of the dawn with a headdress of dead rainbows . Rick cocked his head . " What are you thinking ? " Hugo 's gaze traced the downy curve of Rick 's chin , the small , cruel eyes . " Nothing . " Rick shook his head . He looked around at Hugo 's bare living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orange shag carpet . The apartment was an unfurnished one-bedroom when Hugo moved in three months ago , and he had left it that way . It was empty except for the thin bedroll Hugo unrolled every night . Rick 's apartment had been just as bare when he rented it , but Rick had immediately recarpeted , painted the walls , hung posters and pictures , bought furniture , and set up his minisalon in the kitchen area . They had each received the same cash down payment three months ago . It was a lot of money . Rick had spent all of his share , then borrowed half of Hugo 's . It was okay . Hugo had no interest in money . And he liked to see Rick happy . " Why do n't you come over to my place ? " said Rick . " I 've got snacks , drinks , music  --  anything you want . " " I do n't want anything . " Hugo felt heavy and earthbound listening to Rick . He wished he had n't seen Quinn this afternoon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take on the world , he reminded Hugo of Teddy . " Do n't worry , the band 's already left , " Rick said , annoyed . " I know you better than that ? ' Hugo the hermit , man of mystery , master of negative vibes . ' "  | " Are we having an argument ? " Hugo asked . " I 'm moving next week , " said Rick , head bobbing . " Someplace fancy . I 'd like to live in a building with a lobby and an elevator and gated underground parking . " He lowered his eyes . " If you want , we could look for a place together . " " You 're getting a little ahead of yourself , " said Hugo . " We still have Liggett ? " " I took care of that . " Rick toyed with his bow tie , smirking . Hugo stared at him . " Let 's get out of here . " Rick indicated the overhead light with a toss of his head . " This place of yours makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hugo , his tone stopping Rick at the door , hand on the knob . " You killed Liggett ? " " We get another big payment now , right ? " said Rick , turning back to him . " I 've been working on a business plan for my salon , " he jabbered . " I 'm thinking of calling it ' Rik 's ' or Rikk 's , ' something distinctive , exotic . Like Jon Peters . You think Barbra Streisand would have gone to him if he spelled his name J-o-h-n ? I do n't think so . " " Rick ? " " You have to differentiate yourself , Hugo , that 's the secret of making it with the top people , Hollywood people . I want to be more than a stylist to them  --  I 'd like to be more of a . . . spiritual advisor . You look good , you feel good , you do good . ' That 's my philosophy of life . " Music blared from one of the apartments across the way , voices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What 's wrong , Rick ? " Rick 's head jerked from side to side , trying to get his bearings in the harsh overhead glare . " I hate an empty room , " he swallowed . " Ca n't we go ? " " No . " " I was mad at you , " Rick blubbered , eyes wide . " What have you done , Rick ? " " Nothing . " Rick twitched . " I did n't do nothing . " He touched his bow tie , nervous . He examined his hand . " My cuticles are ragged . I 'm going to have to put on some lotion . " " Killing Liggett by yourself was dangerous , " said Hugo . " We 're supposed to be a team . The two of us , working together . " " You do n't act like we 're a team , " pouted Rick . " You do n't act like you want me around , not unless it 's time to do some business . " He shook his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Hugo . I fucking saw you . "  | " What are you talking about ? " Hugo said , exasperated . Everytime he seemed about to follow Rick 's thought processes to a logical conclusion , Rick suddenly veered off into unexplored terrain . " You do n't go for little weekend drives with me , " accused Rick . " Fine . You missed your Tuesday night facial . Fine . Hey , it 's your pores ? " " You 're not making any sense . " " I saw you Friday night , " said Rick , " you and Joe and that guy in the judge 's bedside photograph . First it 's milk and cookies with Rachel and the brat , and now you 're hanging out with the husband , too . One big happy family . " " Are you talking about Quinn ? " Hugo could see the pain in Rick 's eyes . " Quinn . . . that 's his name ? Does Quinn know what you did to the judge , Hugo ? Or is Quinn the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to whack out his old man ? " " Whack out ' ? " Hugo started to laugh . " Did I get it right ? " said Rick , his head bobbing wildly . " Yeah ? Is it Quinn ? " " You 're being ridiculous , " said Hugo . " I gave Quinn and Joe a ride to the graveyard , that 's all . " " I 'm not stupid , Hugo . " " I know that . You should n't be hanging around Rachel 's house , though , or Joe 's , either . You 're putting yourself at risk . " " Like you care , " mumbled Rick . " I do care , " said Hugo . Rick brightened . " You should n't have killed Liggett , though , " said Hugo . " Not without me . " " I was showing some initiative , " insisted Rick , his suit as bright with promise as a robin 's egg . " I thought you 'd be proud of me . " " Did you wear gloves when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you dump the gun you used on Liggett ? " Rick shrugged . " You have a juvenile record , " explained Hugo . " Your prints are in the databank . They have computers that can run a match in less than twenty minutes . " " Gloves make my hands sweat , " said Rick . " I get a rash . " Hugo rubbed the sides of his head , squeezing , trying to hold things together . Rick was going to ruin everything . Part of Hugo wished he would . At least it would be over . The world was too loud and the killings just made it worse . " Do n't worry , Hugo , I 'd never rat you out , " nodded Rick . " You and me , Hugo , you and me . .. "  | " Yeah . " Hugo was so tired . There was the faint sound of breaking glass . The party had moved into one of the downstairs apartments , the music muffled like distant thunder . More breaking glass . Hugo was back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the kitchen . Teddy sat on the couch , blinking back the fear . . . " I should have waited for you with Liggett , " agreed Rick , " but an artist needs to . . . express himself . " His face went blank for an instant , then reasserted itself . " Everything 's going to be fine , Hugo , you 'll see . Six months from now I 'll be combing out Julia Roberts 's hair and giving her advice on her love life . I know you do n't care about money , but it will be nice to have a shitload . You 'll see . " " It would be nice , " said Hugo , unconvinced . " You can hang out at my salon or just stay home and think , " bubbled Rick . " I mean , there 's no reason for us to stop seeing each other when this is all over , right ? " " No reason at all . " " Really ? We can still be together ? " " Where else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sharp tiny teeth in a smile and Hugo imagined a vast shrieking . Rick glanced around for a mirror , gave up on finding a reflective surface in Hugo 's apartment . " This Quinn guy is n't your friend , " he said lightly , almost as an afterthought , " he just wants to cause trouble . Some people just ca n't leave well enough alone . "  | You still have n't found anything that connects Fontayne to your stepfa-ther 's murder , have you ? " said Jen . " Not yet . " " Not yet . Does that mean you 're getting close ? " " Not yet . " Jen splashed water in his face and he splashed her back , salt spray dripping from her smile . " I have n't given up , " said Quinn . " Of course not , " said Jen , floating on her back now , the two of them fifty yards offshore , the sky a deep blue above , the hot sun glaring off the Pacific , addling their brains , intoxicating . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , blue sky  --  it was easy to lose perspective and forget which way was up . Quinn dove under , nibbled at her toes , hearing her laugh before coming up for air . He could see Katie treading water a short distance away , giving him dirty looks , then looking away when he beckoned her closer . " If I was being attacked by a great white shark , your daughter would throw me a bloody steak , " said Jen . " What do you expect ? You stole the man of her dreams . " " Wait until her hormones start kicking in , and she discovers boys ? " " I 've already reserved a spot for her in this small convent school in Switzerland ? "  | " It 's the call of the wild , Quinn , you 're not going to be able to stop her , " said Jen , her slim feet happily paddling away . " Nothing will . " " Let 's talk about something else . " She sank below the surface , bobbed back immediately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mine about Teddy and his wife , " she said , wiping her eyes . " You were suspicious about her and Fontayne having an affair . . . " " Jen ? " " I was discreet , " she said . " I made it sound more like idle curiosity , which is nothing out of the usual . David shoots photographs for the Orange County society pages and he always has gossip so juicy it quivers . " Quinn watched the water stream down her neck . " So what did he say ? " " He saw Teddy and Marie just a few weeks ago at some Opera Guild event . David said the two of them seemed very much in love . David has a good eye . These society events can be pretty painful , everyone leering at the camera in silly hats , pretending to be having a good time . He said Teddy and Marie were the real a girlfriend , " said Jen , " but it 's not Marie . David says Fontayne started dating about a year after his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman is a another blue blood , a wealthy widow ? her money is old , she 's about forty . She keeps him quite busy . Fontayne would n't fool around with a friend 's wife . He would n't do anything to jeopardize his chances for making it onto the Supreme Court . " " Thanks for your help . " " What 's the matter ? " said Jen . " I thought you 'd be pleased . " " I said thanks . " Quinn could see Katie inching closer , straining to hear . He swam to Jen , put his arms around her , and Katie backed off . " So Fontayne and Marie were n't having an affair , " he said , keeping his voice low . " Great . " Jen bobbed against him , belly to belly , their private merry-go-round . " You still think he was involved , though . " He wished she would n't keep asking . " I saw something at Teddy 's house the morning you and I went there ? " " You told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't just that , " said Quinn . " It was the way he did it , the way he held his head , his attitude . It reminded me of something , but I could n't remember what . I got the same sensation at his house yesterday morning . The way he sat there , lounging about , the way he waved off his servant ? his tone of voice was very polite , but his gesture was pure arrogance . I had seen that before . I knew it , but I still could n't remember where . " p 151 Jen kissed him , tiny kisses circling his mouth . " It 'll come back to you . Then maybe you can see things more clear ? " " It did come back to me , " Quinn said , pulling back slightly . " Last night I went for a drive . I ended up parked in front of the first house Teddy and I moved into after my mother left . After Joe Steps disappeared . It seemed like Teddy moved us every few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place where the two of us would be able to get along together , where we would be comfortable . " He smiled to himself . " I left home before he found the right spot . " " What did you remember , " Jen said softly , her eyes on his . Quinn looked down . Looked away . Finally came back to her bright green eyes . " I . . . I did n't think it would be this hard talking about it . " " That 's alright , " she teased , peering at him through half-lowered lashes . " I know most of your secrets by now , one or two more wo n't shock me . " " It 's not about me . " Quinn swallowed . " It 's about Teddy . " He took a deep breath , but instead of diving , he stayed where he was , in Jen 's arms , slowly letting it out . " We had been living in the house for about a year . I must have been eleven or twelve years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voices in the living room , and I crept into the hallway . There was a man with Teddy , but the room was dark and I could n't really see him . He was sitting in Teddy 's chair , this beautiful , high-backed leather chair , smoking a cigarette . All I remember was the way his legs were crossed at the knee and the way he flicked ashes on the carpet like he did n't care if he set the house on fire . It infuriated me . I wanted to run into the living room and hit the man in Teddy 's chair , but I did n't . " " What was the man saying to Teddy ? " " I do n't know . " The sun coming off the water made his eyes burn . " It was n't what he was saying that mattered , it was the way Teddy was react-ing . " He shook his head . " Teddy and I . . . we had our problems , but I respected him . He took no crap from anyone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sound of the man 's voice , " said Quinn , " but what was clear then ... and clear now , was Teddy 's resentment of the man , and his total surrender to him . " Quinn trailed a hand in the water , not able to look at Jen . " It was like the guy had something on him . It was weird . I had never seen Teddy like that . " " You think that man was Fontayne ? " Jen looked skeptical . " Yes . " Quinn looked at her . " I sat outside that house last night , and it was like I was a kid again . . . ashamed for Teddy . "  | " Fontayne said Teddy had worked for him , " said Jen . " Maybe he was a demanding boss . Maybe that 's what you saw ? " " No , " insisted Quinn . " Teddy was on his own by that time . He rented space in a nice office building . He took me there sometimes . It had new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't his boss . Besides , Teddy would never have let his boss beat him down like that . He would n't . " " Even if it was Fontayne you saw that night , I still do n't know what this all means . " " Neither do I. " Quinn broke away from her . " Not yet . " " I 'm going back to shore , " said Jen , keeping her distance . " I 'll study those prison records you brought . Okay ? " Quinn nodded , then watched her swim back to shore , the water getting colder with every stroke between them . A hand grabbed his ankle and pulled him under for an instant . " Race you to the marker buoy , " shouted Katie , taking off , her arms a pinwheel of motion . Quinn watched Jen , waited until she reached the shore before chasing after Katie . He barely beat her to the buoy . Katie was getting faster or he was getting slower . She was getting faster . That had to be it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him , and say , " When you have kids , I hope you get one just like you . " Like a curse . Well , Teddy had gotten his wish , and Quinn could n't be happier . He pushed his hair out of his face , watching her practice her backstroke , swimming parallel to the shore . " Chin up , " he called , nodding as she corrected her position . Katie was a good swimmer . He had been teaching her since she was two , at first taking her out into the bay , which was a little warmer . Now they swam together in the ocean , partners in the open water , staying out until their lips turned blue . A brown pelican swooped low over the water , regarding the two of them , then continued on , circling around the artificial island in the distance . The island was really an oil-drilling platform , its machinery artfully hidden under a series of pastel structures that looked like condominiums . Tourists were actually fooled sometimes . Katie kept wanting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better . Maybe when she was older . If they were still swimming together . Two years . . . she was going to be gone two years . Kids and parents get out of practice . Suddenly you 're seeing each other on holidays and checking your watch in the silence . He glanced back to see Jen sunning herself on the blanket . She was wearing a pale-green maillot that shoved off her color and her curves , p 153 her face sheltered by a long-billed cap as she read through the stack of Joe 's trial transcripts and prison records Quinn had brought . A red Scirroco with tinted windows cruised slowly along the beach , stereo cranked . Third time around . The driver was probably checking out the bikinis while he looked for a parking spot . He and Jen had argued all the way back from Fontayne 's house yesterday . " You trust that smug son of a bitch ? " Quinn kept asking . " I do n't have to trust him , " Jen had replied . " I do n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is doing good things . The Elena Foundation is a worthwhile project . " Quinn distrusted righteous types , people with flags and bumper stickers and little charts showing that the world was on the brink and they were just the ones to save it . " What 's the matter , daddy ? Your face is all red . " Quinn dove under the cool water , rose slowly , trailing bubbles . A heavily garbed figure moved slowly down the crowded beach , avoiding the blankets and bare bodies , picking cans and bottles out of the trash , dropping them into the string bag around her waist . She wore gloves and long pants , her head covered so only her eyes showed . The teenagers called her " the mummy , " but her name was Mai . She was a Cambodian girl their own age , making money collecting throwaways , her stultifying outfit worn to protect her from the sun . She would n't want to darken her skin any more than it already was . A Cambodian girl could lose status that way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bronzing in the heat . It had taken Quinn most of last summer to get her to talk to him . One word at a time . He never saw her other features , but her eyes reminded him of a hawk he had seen tethered in a roadside zoo , fierce and determined to get free . Katie splashed over and hugged him , shivering . She was eight years old , skinny and lithe . He wondered how long she would cling to him like this , out over her head in the cold cold sea , utterly convinced that he would never let anything harm her . Forever , he hoped . " You want to go back ? " he asked . She glanced at Jen on the shore . " Not yet . " He could see water beads on her eyelashes like pearls as she clung to him . " I wish you 'd give Jen a chance , " he said . " I think you 'd like her . " Katie snorted . " I do n't know what you have against her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years before I met Jen . " " Mama still loves you , " she said quietly . " Do n't you love her ? " " You do n't understand , Katie . Adults ? "  | " You do n't understand . I see the way Mama looks at you when you are n't looking . " " Your mother has a boyfriend ? " She stuck her tongue out . " When you 're right , you 're right , " smiled Quinn , pulling her to his chest , trying to keep her warm . Katie glared at the beach . " You 're not going to marry her , are you ? " Her breath smelled of bubble gum . " You could marry Mama again , sleep in her room . You do n't tell me stories anymore at night . You 're so far away now . " " I 'm right here . " Quinn wiped at his face . He had salt water in his eyes . Katie shook her head . " Not like before . " " No . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jen waved at them from the shore . She had put down the transcripts . He did n't blame her . Reading in the sun gave him a headache , too . Jen sat on her haunches , facing them , combing out her hair . Katie looked at his face , pushed away from him . " Mama 's as pretty as she is . Prettier . " " Let 's go back in . " " Just cause she 's got nice hair you think she 's prettier than Mama , " accused Katie , dark eyes flashing . " Wait 'll Mama starts using her special new shampoo . " " Your mother has beautiful hair . I 've got the bad hair genes you should be worried about . " " This boy said his shampoo would make our hair thick , " nodded Katie . " I did n't like him , but he had nice hair . " Quinn dunked his head under the cold water , shook himself . " What boy ? " he said , blowing spray from his lips . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selling shampoo and makeup , but I did n't let him in . He was cute . . . he looked like Dylan on Beverly Hills 90210 . ' " She shook her head at Quinn 's ignorance . " I did n't like the way he kept playing with his hair , though . He had dead-fish eyes , too . I did n't let him in . " " That 's good . " " This boy had so many earrings , " her head bobbed , excited . " Five in one ear . " She clung to him . " Becky Cramer got her nose pierced , " she confided . Her voice dropped , cajoling , " Dad . . . ? " " No . " They treaded water together , floating easily , knees bumping . " I do n't want to go to stupid France , " she said suddenly , her voice so quiet it jabbed at his heart .  | " You 'll like it ? " " If it 's so good , why are n't you coming with us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Katie glanced at Jen , angry . " Race you ! " she shouted , face contorted as she turned away , kicking furiously toward the marker buoy . He watched her strong stroke . This time he was n't going to give her quite so much of a head start .  | Your young man does n't like me , does he ? " said Ellis Fontayne . " No , " Jen said , " Quinn does n't like you . " " Ah , well , " Fontayne nodded . " I did try with him ? " " No , you did n't . " " Well , it was a lost cause , anyone could see that , " said Fontayne , reddening . He bent down and picked up a popsicle wrapper from the dirty sidewalk , walked over to an overflowing trash can . " I do hope you and I can be friends . " " Why is that important to you ? " Jen said as she peered into the viewfinder . She photographed him dropping the wrapper into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his manicure . Late afternoon light , F16 , plenty of depth of field , even the background Fatburger was in sharp focus . " I 'm not used to working so hard for someone 's approval , " said Fontayne , only half-joking . " I wo n't tell if you wo n't , " said Jen , enjoying the brief confusion in his eyes . What Fontayne was n't used to was not being in control  --  he probably dominated most social situations with his courtesy and caustic wit , a linguistic good-cop , bad-cop routine that was as effective in private life as it had been in court . " Let 's start over , " said Fontayne . " Give me another chance . I need your support and to do that I need to excite your imagination . " He smiled  | at her , peering over his half-glasses , dark eyes twinkling . " That would n't be so terrible , would it ? " Jen photographed his flirtatious grin . " I 'll let you know , " she said , noting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , leaving her unsure whether he was flattering her or insulting her . Games within games . One thing she was sure of : Fontayne never said anything that he had n't practiced and rehearsed for maximum effect . They were walking along Carson Street in Hawaiian Gardens , a seedy inland town on the border of L.A. and Orange County . There never were any Hawaiians in Hawaiian Gardens  --  real estate developers thought it was an exotic name that would appeal to new arrivals from the South and Midwest , drawn to Southern California by the booming economy . It worked . Hawaiian Gardens had been a good place for blue-collar workers to raise their families , a multiethnic suburb with neat lawns and picnics in the park . Now it was a great place to sell security bars and razor wire and forty-ounce cans of beer . " You 're not going to recognize this area in five years , " Fontayne told her as he gestured expansively toward the boarded-up storefronts and concrete-block check-cashing bunkers . He strolled down the street , wearing gray linen trousers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edged a shattered green bottle of Thunderbird into the gutter with the toe of his Loafers . Seeing the broken glass reminded her of the Cambodian girl on the beach a few hours ago . Jen had watched her delicately picking through the trash barrels for cans and bottles to recycle , and the girl had suddenly looked at her with those beautiful dark eyes . Jen had experienced a momentary flash of recognition , a kinship beyond logic or reason . She had felt the sensation before , usually in the most incongruous situations , in the lowered glance of an Afghani teenager or the grim smile of a Somali child . It was the recognition of orphans , one to another . It was different between her and Quinn . They were lovers , but they were drawn together from across a vast divide . Seeing him swimming with Katie , hearing their laughter echoing across the waves , there was a connection between them that Jen could n't approach . It was the same intimacy she had with her father , and when he had died the connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dying . Atoms decayed . Family was a fiction badly written , and all Quinn 's good intentions would n't alter that fact . The idea of her and Quinn getting married , settling down , raising their own happy little family , that nuclear horror show " Ms. Takamura . . . ? Jen ? "  | " I 'm sorry . " She roughly wiped her eyes . Ridiculous . " I was day-dreaming . " " Ah . Well , I too have dreams , Ms. Takamura . " Fontayne acknowledged the waves of three black men standing on the opposite corner . " We start next month ! " he called to them . " Make sure you sign up ! " Jen switched to her camera with the telephoto lens , bringing the men in close . " Those men are unemployed carpenters , " he said , as they posed for Jen , flexing their muscles , laughing , " hard workers too , but they 've been frozen out of the trade unions . African-Americans hold only six percent of the construction jobs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've already talked to those men about the Elena Foundation and our common goals . The project is going to use local labor as much as possible ; without the people feeling a stake in the success of the school , we 're doomed to failure . " Fontayne talked like he was being paid by the word , but Jen liked what he was saying . She liked what he was doing , too . They rounded the corner and Fontayne fairly raced ahead of her down the sidewalk , striding over the broken glass . " There it is , Jen , there is the future , " proclaimed Fontayne , pointing to the vast windowless bulk of the Great Southland Mall . The chain-link fence surrounding the closed mall was rusting , whole sections cut out , hanging open . Jen saw him through the camera , filling the foreground with his enthusiasm while the abandoned mall loomed over him in the background . His confidence almost convinced her . The Great Southland Mall was another in a series of real estate fiascoes by a defunct S &L; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial crimes . Built in a crime-ridden location at a cost of over $110 million , the mall had been completed just in time for the collapse of the Southern California economy . The U.S. taxpayer had picked up the tab . It was just what Fontayne was looking for . " It 's going to be called The Elena School , ' " said Fontayne , hanging on to the fence with his fingertips , gazing raptly at his new purchase . " Is n't it wonderful ? " Fontayne had bought the mall from the Resolution Trust Authority . He paid slightly less than $3 million for the property , then donated it to the Elena Trust . " Have you read the prospectus I gave you ? " he asked . " I 've formed a blue-ribbon board of directors  --  clergy , educators , entrepreneurs  --  men and women willing to put their money and their time toward this most p 159 noble venture . If you decide to help , Jen , you 're going to be in very good company . " The prospectus had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charts illustrating the financial details . It would cost around $20 million to convert the mall into an independent school system , kindergarten through high school . Air-conditioned , spacious , quiet , and safe , the school would be open to all races and religions . Tuition would be free , but parental involvement was required in matters from building maintenance to staffing the cafeteria to providing security . Fontayne estimated an initial enrollment of three thousand students , and the need for an endowment of at least $100 million . Jen kept Fontayne in the viewfinder , preferring to see him framed by the camera than on his own , without boundaries . That 's the way she liked things , with edges and limits and her finger on the button . She felt like a hunter , capturing souls without shedding a drop of blood . " I 'm willing to donate my entire fortune to the cause , " said Fontayne , looking small and vulnerable in the viewfinder , " but we 'll still need substantial corporate sponsors , both now and in the future , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really begins . That 's why your photographs are so important  --  they reveal the power and dignity of the human spirit . I want you to document the building of the Elena School . I intend to distribute your portfolio to every member of Congress , to every Fortune 500 CEO , to every newspaper and magazine publisher in the U.S. Our nation is adrift , Jen , " he said , voice rising . " It 's up to us to provide a beacon of hope . " Jen put down the camera . The two of them were very close now . Fontayne was breathing hard , cheeks flushed , waiting for her to respond to his offer . " Life is fleeting , " said Fontayne , " it 's over so fast . . . You 're young , you think you have forever , but you 'll wake up one morning and you wo n't recognize yourself in the mirror . " He wiped his dusty shoes with a handkerchief . A car drove slowly past , young men hanging out the windows , cursing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His eyes were fixed on Jen . " I 've made a great many mistakes , " Fontayne said , " errors in judgment and grand failures . " A gasoline truck rumbled by , its dirty wake eddying around them . " We have a whole lifetime to make mistakes , " he said , " and just a few short years to try and set things right . There 's never enough time . Never . It does n't seem fair , does it ? " " Welcome to the club , " said Jen , annoyed at his self-pity.  | Fontayne smiled ruefully . " You 've seen terrible things . . . do n't you sometimes worry that you 're losing your professional distance ? " " I 've never had that problem . " Jen could feel her jaw tighten . " I 'm here , " she said , tapping her heart . " The terrible things are on the other side of the camera . " " Ah , " nodded Fontayne , " how fortunate for you . " The lines around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underneath the arrogance . " Well , I hope the horror always stays on the other side of the camera . " He stared off at the deserted mall . Trash had billowed against the chain-link fence surrounding it , Sunday funnies and fast-food wrappers shiny with grease . " I loved the law . My wife said I loved the law more than her . " He shrugged helplessly . " Who knows ? The law is eternal , while we are small and fleeting things . The law can be more than a protector of our rights , our freedoms  --  the law can nurture our very humanity . I like to think I 've helped shape the law to that end . " " You 've made a good start , " said Jen . " That 's why I 'm here . " " A start . Yes . " Fontayne nodded to himself . " But just a beginning . " He looked at her . " Quinn was correct when he said I hoped to be appointed to the Supreme Court . I 've received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question . Imminent , perhaps . I would welcome the opportunity . There is so much wrong in the world , I hardly know where to begin . " " I doubt that , " smiled Jen . Fontayne laughed . " You 're a tough one . " He took her hand . His skin was warm and dry . " A few days ago you stood in my office and called me a philanthropist . ' You sounded like a biologist cataloguing a rare species of insect . " " That 's unfair , Ellis . " " Perhaps . " Fontayne patted her hand . " You 've seen that bumper sticker , The one who dies with the most toys wins ' ? " He chuckled . " Such foolishness , but I was foolish once myself . Now I know that it 's not what a man dies with that defines him , but what he does with his life . One marvels at the public legacy of Rockefeller , the public record of Earl Warren , while their private indulgences are long forgotten . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give you some advice ? Do n't squander yourself in frivolous pursuits . Keep to the eternal verities . Traditional values . . . they 're not for people like us . I have three children , but truth be told , I rarely think of them . Family is fleeting , Jen . Friends fail us . Even love does not last . Only our good name and good works may yet endure . " Jen thought of Quinn hanging on to the idea of family , trying to hold back the night with some fragile dream of mommy-daddy-baby . Kitchee-  | kitchee-coo . She wished she could believe in the dream with him . It was a wonderful dream , but she knew better . " I talk too much , " said Fontayne , smiling . " I would apologize , but I will surely commit the same sin again . " " There 's no need to apologize . " " Your young man , " said Fontayne . " You love each other very much , that 's obvious . " A cloud passed over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's too emotional for you , though . You 're a professional , cool and precise . He 's volatile , thrashing about , destroying that which he is trying to save . " He slowly shook his head . " It 's not going to work . You know that , do n't you ? " " Stick to the law , Mr. Fontayne . " Jen was n't sure if she was angrier at his presumptuousness or that her own doubts were so transparent . " I take no pleasure in my judgment , let me assure you , " said Fontayne . " My wife and I . . . there was passion , there was love , there were children . It did us no good . " He gazed at the graffiti layered on the nearby buildings , the mosaic of illegible posters and peeling paint . " All things must pass , Jen , " he said , quoting the Buddha , " what is born will die , what has been gathered will be dispersed ? " " What has been accumulated will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What has been built up will collapse , " they said in tandem now , " what has been high will be brought low . . . " The two of them stood beside that busy street , horns honking around them .  | Quinn checked the clock on the wall . 4:43 . He 'd wait another few minutes . The trick was to call just before quitting time , when a person would do almost anything to get off the phone and out the door . He sat in the glassed-in conference room at SLAP , watching the second hand sweep the dial . When Tina Chavez had read through Joe Steps 's prison file , her attention had been drawn to his connection with Teddy , his unanswered letters , his lack of visitors . She had noted the length of his sentence and gone over the evaluations of his behavior over the long years . She had missed something , though . Quinn had missed it , too . It was easy to overlook , but Jen had spotted it this morning on the beach . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another prisoner , Neil Stimmler , had made a compassionate request to speak to Joe from his hospital bed . Maybe it was nothing . But it was worth checking into . Quinn saw Napitano on the far side of the editorial offices , the publisher angrily gesticulating at one of the senior editors . He was sporting chinese-print pajamas . A dragon wearing dragons . Quinn slouched down in his chair , hoping to avoid being noticed . He had been AWOL most of last week . 4:47 . Almost time . The yellow legal-size pad on his desk was covered with his handwriting , the name " Hugo Ganz " at the top of the page with a box around it . Hugo Ganz : Joe 's driver , Joe 's friend . The man did look  | creepy  --  whoever had made Hugo had run out of flesh before the job was over . That was n't Hugo 's fault . He took good care of Joe , and when he said he was sorry about what had happened to Teddy , Quinn believed him . That had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SLAP 's computers to check him out . Quinn checked everyone out . He ran credit checks on corporate attorneys and government officials , scrolled through their driving history , corroborated their educational credentials . All those mail-order university degrees . He told himself he did it to evaluate their information , but he knew it was because he liked having an edge , a glimpse of their secret self . The first time he was in Jen 's apartment he had gone through her medicine chest , looked through her linen closet . She had surprised him . There were lightweight tranquilizers in the medicine chest and a heavy-duty vibrator under the towels . Hugo had only been driving a cab for five months , got his chauffeur 's license three weeks before Joe was released . An interesting coincidence . No arrests , not even a traffic ticket . If anything , his credit file was too clean . No outstanding balance on his credit cards , no bounced checks . This morning , Quinn had asked a friend at the Long Beach Police Department , Lt. Esteban Morales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ license sent to the National Crime Bureau . Esteban had called back a little while ago , said Hugo 's prints were n't on any criminal database . " He is as close to an honest man as you will find , " mocked Esteban . " Disappointed ? " Quinn almost was . It was so much easier when the bad guys wore nametags . At 4:55 , Quinn phoned the prison , identified himself as working for the Orange County District Attorney 's office , and asked for Inmate Records . The faint chatter of voices and computer keys at the SLAP office gave his call a proper soundtrack . Napitano spotted him . Shit . " Here you are , dear boy , " said Napitano , barging into the conference room , his pajamas in full sail , making himself comfy on the chair next to Quinn . " I was wondering if I was ever going to see you again . Was the line too long at the welfare office ? Hmmm ? " Quinn silenced him with an upraised hand and an imploring look as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Narbold , Records . " She sounded slightly out of breath , talking fast . Quinn took his time answering , remaining polite but friendly . He said he was Leonard Dale from Assistant D.A . Tina Chavez ' office  --  Napitano raised an eyebrow at that  --  and gave Tina 's personal ID number , reading  | it off the request that she had made for Joe Steps 's records . It was part of Joe 's file now , a thick sheaf of papers sitting on his desk . " I 'm sorry , Mr. Dale , is it ? I 'm just about ready to leave for the day . Why do n't you fax me your official request and I 'll return your call first thing tomorrow . " " Ms. Narbold , gosh , I apologize for keeping you , but I 've already sent a fax , " said Quinn , acting confused . He read the Records fax number off the initial request . " That 's correct , is n't it ? I sent it hours ago . I guess you 're as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freeze for the last two years , " he clucked . Napitano sat forward , his round face flushed with delight . " Same here , " she agreed . " It 's so late , though ? " " I really hope you can help me on this , Anna Marie , one wage slave to another . Her nibs is going to be pulling an all-nighter , and if I do n't get the information from you , my a-s-s is going to be in a sling , pardon my French . " Napitano pretended to be shocked , covering his mouth with the palm of his hand . Long sigh from Ms. Narbold . " Go ahead . " " You sent our office a file on a recently paroled inmate , one Joseph Sabino Staducci . " " I remember , " she hurried . " There was a mention of a compassionate request by another inmate , a Neil T. Stimmler , who was at that time a patient in the infirmary . Assistant D.A . Chavez was curious what Mr. Stimmler was incarcerated for , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long silence . Ms. Narbold would be watching the clock in her office , gauging the buildup of traffic on the freeways for every minute she lingered . It was a logarithmic calculation everyone in Southern California practiced. 5:01 . She was on her time now . There was a sudden flurry of keystrokes over the phone , and Quinn silently cheered . A few moments later Ms. Narbold 's voice said , reading , " Stimmler , Neil T. , extensive record for burglary , larceny , possession of a controlled substance , served eight years on the most recent conviction , receiving stolen property . Released April 5 , this year . Okay ? " She sounded annoyed . " One more question , please , Anna Marie , and then I 'll let you go home to whoever is lucky enough ? " " Make it snappy . " Napitano rolled his eyes . " Do you have a current address for Mr. Stimmler ? Someone our office can contact ? It 's very important . "  | More key strokes . " P.O. Box 834 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Phone number is 619-827-9983 . " Quinn wrote it down . " Thanks ? " She had already hung up . Quinn put down the phone . " Oh my , " beamed Napitano , " I had no idea your job was so much fun . Lying , duplicity , unctuous conversation . " He smacked his lips over the words like they were the caviar he devoured for breakfast , " I am paying you entirely too much money , dear boy . " " You want to give me a little privacy here , Nino ? I 've got another call to make . This pans out you 're going to get one hell of a story . " " Leave ? " Napitano was shocked . " Out of the question . " He leaned over the table , holding his chin with both hands , waiting . Quinn dialed Harriet Boggs . It rang a long time before someone finally answered . " Yeah ? " A male voice , raspy from cigarettes . " Mr. Boggs ? " " Who the fuck wants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receiver an inch away from his ear . " This is Don Parker , Prison Outreach . May I speak to Mrs. Boggs , please ? " Napitano silently applauded . " She 's at the Tick-Tock . " " Pardon me ? " said Quinn . " The diner . This about my asshole brother-in-law ? " " I 'm calling in reference to Mr. Neil Stimmler . Is he available ? " Boggs laughed , sucking in snot . " Sure , Mac , " he cleared his throat , spit , " dial 1-800-HELL , he 's standing around in asbestos skivvies shoveling coal into the blast furnace . " " Mr. Boggs ? " Boggs had hung up . Quinn thought for a moment , then hit the redial button , listening to the numbers beep off while Napitano smiled . " Mr. Boggs , " Quinn said quickly , " I have some money ? " " Yeah ? " " Prison Outreach is a non-profit organization devoted to helping exconvicts make the transition into society ? " " You said something about money . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boggs . " How did he die ? " " He stopped breathing , " Boggs sneered . " About time , if you ask me . What 's this about money ? "  | " Prison Outreach may be willing to authorize a bereavement bene-fit ? " Napitano shook his head no . " What 's that mean ? " " If we receive proof of his death , we may be able to cut you a check to cover funeral expenses . Do you have a medical report , police report . . . was an autopsy performed ? " Napitano shook his head harder . " Yeah , fucking Quincy showed up with the county meat wagon . " Boggs hacked up something that sounded like it had been wrapped around his intestines . " Look , Mac , Neil 's been dying for years . He finally caught the train last week . There were n't no autopsy , no police . Funeral home just came and bagged him up . You gon na pay me for that ? I got a receipt . " " Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guffawed . " He was a convict , not the fucking king of Egypt . We cremated his ass . Got the plastic urn and it still cost $317 , tax included . I would n't have paid a nickel , but my wife went and put it on her charge card . Women . You gon na send us that check soon ? I 'm never going to be able to rent out that trailer again , not the way he left it . Stink to high heaven . " " Has his trailer been disturbed ? I might want to drive out and take a look at it . " " What for ? " " Mr. Boggs , are you interested in receiving payment ? " " You want us to put up another ex-con , is that it ? Okay by me , but we 're talking $350 a month rent and they pay their own utilities . Pretty nice trailer , too . I was just kidding about the smell . " " Give me the address , Mr. Boggs , we 'll be in touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boggs . He gave Quinn the address anyway .  | It 's not really so bad , " said Harriet Boggs . She opened the door to the rusted trailer , holding a can of Lysol out into the darkness , spraying herself a path inside . " You just got to get used to it . " Quinn followed her inside , his nose burning from the stink . It smelled like burning hair inside the trailer . Dirty hair . Harriet flipped on the light , walked over the debris of clothes and trash , and switched on the air conditioner . It made a few thumping sounds and stopped . She banged it with the heel of her hand . It started up . Quinn decided to leave the door open anyway . " The mister said somebody from the prison office called a few hours ago , asking about my brother , Neil , " said Harriet , " but he did n't say you were coming by tonight . He 's gone to Bingo . I hope you do n't mind talking to me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 're the person I wanted to talk with . " " You best call me Harriet . " She wiped her hands on her apron , looking pleased . She was a buxom , older woman , with weary eyes and too much fat around her heart . She was still wearing her food-stained uniform from the kitchen at the Tick-Tock , her flesh the color and consistency of wet dough . Quinn had driven to the desert straight from SLAP , but got caught in the rush-hour mess . It should have taken an hour . It took three . Going  | back would be faster . When he arrived at the diner it was after 8 p.m. and Harriet was just finishing her shift . She made him have a cup of coffee and peach pie before anything else , saying he looked like he had low blood sugar . The pie was good . The coffee was n't . The trailer was bare of furniture except for a worn recliner and a single straight-back kitchen chair with a cracked seat . Harriet turned on the television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she thought he was considering moving in and wanted to show off the facilities . Quinn stood just within the doorway , looking at the bits and pieces of the room while Harriet moved nervously from one place to the other . Her feet were swollen , but she did n't sit down . " You must have cared a great deal for your brother to take him in , " Quinn said . " With his record , a lot of people , even family , would have turned their back on him . " " Oh I could n't never do that , " said Harriet , shaking her head . " The mister . . . he talks rough , but there was no way I was going to let my big brother die alone . " She dabbed at her eyes with the edge of her apron . " ' Course , he did die alone , in a manner of speaking  --  just last Thursday ? but I was close by , at least . " " That 's something . " " Yes , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had his condition deteriorated in the days before his death ? " " Neil had been poorly for months . That 's why the prison let him out . They figured it was cheaper that way . " " Yes , but the last time you saw him , was he worse than usual ? " " It was hard to tell with Neil . " She wandered to the tiny sink , picked up a crusted fork , then dropped it back with a clatter . " Neil hardly ever let me in here for more than a few minutes , " she said , clearly embarrassed at the mess , " then after he passed on , after that , I still had a hard time coming in here . I should have picked up ? " " It 's not so bad , " lied Quinn . " There are divorced guys all over the country living just like this . " " You 're a nice person , " nodded Harriet , " a very nice person . You should have heard the nasty comments about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oxygen tank . " She straightened up , patted her hair , and faced him . " What did you want to talk to me about anyway ? The mister said there might be some money in it for us ? " " I 'm a magazine writer , " said Quinn , not wanting to lie to her anymore than he had to . " I 'd like to ask you some questions about Neil , and I 'd be happy to pay you for any help you might give me. "  | " I do n't know . . . Neil never got much respect in life . I 'd hate to have all the worst spread out for everyone to see . " " That 's not my intention , " said Quinn . Both of them were still standing , neither of them touching anything in the room . " I 'm working on a related story  --  I 'm not even sure Neil is part of it , but if he is , I think he got a raw deal and I 'd like ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He absolutely did . " " I do n't see a phone , " said Quinn . " We never had no phone in here , " said Harriet . " The mister was n't about to let Neil run up any bills to them 900 numbers . Neil would have , too . He could n't help it . " " Perhaps he made some calls from your home ? Collect ? " " Oh my , no . " Quinn walked to the two cabinets in the kitchen . " May I ? " " Ai n't nothing in there . Neil said he traveled light . " The cabinets were empty . The shallow closet was piled with dirty laundry . Quinn took a deep breath and went through them , checked every pocket , felt every seam and cuff . Nothing . He had to resist the urge to wash his hands . He looked in the bathroom next , lifted up the tank lid , felt around behind the bowl . Then he washed his hands . Twice . " If you 're looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His lungs were shot , and I would n't allow it . " Quinn bent down , started looking over the magazines and newspapers on the floor , wincing at the smell . Stirring things up just made it worse . " What are you looking for ? " said Harriet . " I 'll be glad to help . Not just for the money , either . " " I do n't know what I 'm looking for , " admitted Quinn , on his hands and knees now , picking through an overturned shoebox . " Is that the way you magazine writers do it ? " asked Harriet , holding up a couple of trashy novels for his inspection , " you just flop around until you find something ? " " That 's pretty much the way I do it , " smiled Quinn , " but it 's not the recommended way to go . " She patted his hand . " You 're doing just fine , honey . " " Ouch . " Quinn picked a tiny shard of glass from his thumb . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a strange bit of glass , very fine , thinner than a lightbulb . " These mean anything ? " Harriet showed him five harmonicas . " I do n't know . " " Neil always had a harmonica in his pocket when he was growing up .  | Seemed like he had a new one every week . " She pretended to be interested in the blank television . " He always had a musical nature . " " When Neil was in prison this last time , " said Quinn , " when he was very sick , he asked to speak to another inmate , a man named Joe Staducci . Did Neil ever talk about him ? Joe Staducci ? Joe Steps ? It 's very important , Harriet . " She shook her head . " What about before ? Before he was sick , when he was n't in prison . Joe was a dancer , a ballroom dancer . Does that ring a bell ? He was a gambler , too . Maybe Neil knew him from before he went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to find out why Neil would have asked to see Joe when he was in the hospital . They were n't even on the same cellblock ? Neil was in minimum security , Joe was doing hard time . There had to be a reason . " " I wish I could help you , honey , but Neil did n't talk much these last few months . He did n't do much of anything . " She brightened . " Maybe you should ask this Joe ? " she suggested . Quinn glanced at his watch . He had gotten a call from Bobby just as he was leaving SLAP , and had promised to meet the kid at a club in Long Beach sometime after ten . Quinn had tried to put him off , but Bobby was insistent , a little stoned too , saying he had " surveillanced " something that he could n't talk about over the phone . Bobby was probably just trying for extra credit in his police-science class , but Quinn humored him . Somebody had to . " Did Neil ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ellis Fontayne . He 's an attorney . Very successful ? " " Neil had plenty of attorneys , " said Harriet , " most of them from Legal Aid . They never were successful for Neil . He was just plain unlucky , there 's no way around it . " " Thanks , anyway . " Quinn scooted forward , reached under the recliner , and pulled out a small wooden box . His excitement dimmed when he saw Lawrence Welk 's picture on the lid with the phrase " and a one , and a two " embossed next to the bandleader 's baton . " There it is , " cried Harriet , taking it from him . " I was wondering where that went to . " She opened the lid and a few bars of music tinkled out , then stopped . " Neil had me drive all over creation looking for this thing . Fresh out of prison and that was all he cared about . Plain pitiful . " " Could I see that , Harriet ? Please ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's a keepsake now . " " I know . " He examined the box , but there was n't anything inside it . " Do you know why Neil was so interested in this particular music box ? "  | " Is the box important ? " Harriet said , excited , the color rising in her neck . " I have no idea . It sounds like it was important to Neil . " " Oh my , yes , Neil loved that music box . He said it reminded him of one he had a long time ago and then lost . I used to walk in sometimes and Neil would be in the recliner , crying , winding it up for one more listen . " Harriet suddenly looked like she had bitten into a rotten apple . " He was thinking about that Sweetie girl , of course . He bought her a music box once , real beautiful one , too , must have cost Neil a pretty penny . " Her face jiggled with annoyance . " Neil was always giving her things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know where he got the money . I told him she was n't no good  --  she had wild eyes , anybody could see that  --  Neil about slapped me . " What 's Sweetie 's real name ? " asked Quinn . " I 'd like to ? " " Sweetie 's dead . Long time ago . Everything was a long time ago . " Harriet sighed . " Poor Neil . She died right after they broke up , too . I think that 's when things really went wrong for Neil , " she sniffled . " He had been in trouble before , of course . . . that darned marijuana , but that was just because he was so nervous and quick tempered . After she died , though , it was just one jail after another . Poor Neil . No matter how hard he tried , something always went wrong . " " What did Sweetie look like ? " asked Quinn . " She 's connected to the music box and the music box seemed to be the only thing your brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , I only met her once , " said Harriet , " and once was plenty . Me and the mister was living up in Northern California , right outside of Red Bluff . Neil brought her up for Thanksgiving dinner . This here 's Sweetie , ' Neil says , waving around one of those marijuana cigarettes like she 's something to be proud of , this skinny little blonde thing with more rings on her fingers than Astor 's pet horse , showing off the music box Neil had just bought for her , bragging on how expensive it cost . " She shook her head in disgust . " Harriet ? " Quinn said patiently . " Are you sure you do n't remember Sweetie 's real name ? Neil must have mentioned it . " Harriet scrunched her brow into soft white furrows , thinking . " Nope . All I remember is her saying she did n't like her given name , said it sounded like a little old lady 's name . She said her folks started calling her Sweetie when she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She shrugged . " That 's all I remember about her . That and she told me she did n't like cinnamon in her candied yams . I spent six hours in a hot  | kitchen making Thanksgiving dinner . What kind of person do n't like cinnamon in yams ? " " Do you know how Sweetie died ? " Quinn had put off asking long enough . Harriet leaned close . " She got herself murdered , " she whispered . " Strangled . Poor Neil . They were n't even going together anymore and he still cried like a baby when he told me about it . Neil was like that , " she clucked . " Always worried about somebody else . " Quinn toyed with the music box , winding it up . " Harriet , sometimes men with that much love in them are also . . . jealous , " he said carefully . " They have a hard time letting go . Was Neil like that ? " " Oh my , yes , " nodded Harriet . " I 'm the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expelled from high school for smacking Vonda Carter . Broke one of her teeth . Front one . " She tapped an incisor . " Caught her kissing my boyfriend . Served her right . That 's the way Neil and I were raised . You do n't let nobody take what 's yours . If you do , pretty soon you do n't have nothing . " " She died in L.A. ? " asked Quinn . " Who ? " " Sweetie . " He opened the lid of the box , listened to the music . It was a nice tune . Old fashioned . A one and a two . " I guess . Yeah , somewhere down there . " " Do you remember when that was ? " " It would have been . . . 1962 , " she said , tucking a wisp of hair back behind her ear . " Yes , 1962 . The mister and I had just celebrated our fiveyear anniversary . That 's the paper anniversary . He got me a box of stationery with my initials on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called up and he was upset and asking if he could come stay with us . Right away , too . Asked if I could wire him bus fare . ' Course I said yes , but he did n't stay long . My husband , he never really understood Neil . " She looked at Quinn . " Honey ? You okay ? " Quinn stared at the music box , listening to the tinkling sound . He finally recognized the song . He was n't tired anymore . He felt so good he was almost airborne . He did n't know much , but he knew enough now to find out who Sweetie was , and there was no telling where that would lead . " Harriet , when Neil sent you looking for the music box , it was n't this specific box that he wanted , was it ? " " What do you mean ? Specific ? " " It did n't have to be a Lawrence Welk music box , did it ? That was n't what Neil asked for . Am I right ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Neil never cared for Lawrence Welk . He  | just said the music box had to play that song . Sweet Adeline . ' He must have loved that song . Everybody to their own taste , that 's what I always say . " Quinn reached in his pocket , handed her all the big bills . " No , honey , " she said , trying to give it back . " This is too much . I did n't do nothing . If I had been able to help you some , that would be different . " Quinn wrapped her fingers around the money .  | Quinn hesitated outside The Summer of Love coffeehouse , " In a Gadda da Vida " shaking the gamboling unicorns painted on the plate glass windows . Bobby spotted him from inside the club , waved to him , excited . The noise level soared as Quinn pushed open the door , the air thick with pachoulie and vanilla incense . Bobby pumped his hand , shouting , " Glad you could make it , dude " in Quinn 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he did so . Bobby led him through the crowded room , wobbling on his platform shoes . Quinn tried not to stare , but it was difficult . There were too many bell bottoms , too many tie-dye dresses , too many peace symbols . Girls with straight blonde hair mouthed the words to the music , clove cigarettes crackling between their fingers , while guys in tinted granny-glasses nodded in time to the rhythm , love beads bouncing . Posters on the walls announced concerts by The Doors and Jefferson Airplane , demanded that Nixon Stop the War ! Father Ho gazed beatifically over a pretty darkhaired girl wearing a Mexican peasant blouse , who watched them from a table in the corner . " This is Felicia , " said Bobby , introducing him to the girl in the peasant blouse . She wore white frosted lipstick that made her look like one of the undead . She had a small yellow flower painted on her cheek . " Felicia , this is Quinn . " Quinn offered his hand . She stared at it , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He sat down . This is what he got for keeping his promise to Bobby . It was after midnight . Quinn had gone back to SLAP after leaving Neil Stimmler 's trailer to use the magazine 's twenty-fourhour line into the California Department of Public Records . His fingers had danced over the keyboard , making music . The Lava lamp on their table slowly percolated , oily red bubbles rising and falling . The neo-hippies around him bobbed their heads as the drummer for Iron Butterfly flogged his drumset  --  Bobby rapped the table in time , while Felicia closed her eyes in ecstasy . Having an old-fashioned name might have bothered Sweetie , but it made it comparatively easy to track her down . According to the state coroner 's reports , in 1962 there were 141 women murdered in the sixcounty region of Southern California , 68 of whom were within Quinn 's rough estimate of Sweetie 's age at the time of her death . There was only one Adeline listed : Adeline Gibson , Caucasian , age twenty , Los Angeles , September 23 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to do with Joe Steps , but the time frame was contiguous to Joe 's own murder conviction . Quinn was going to have a little talk with Joe tomorrow , ask him about that bedside visit with Neil Stimmler . Tomorrow . After he got some sleep . " In a Gadda da Vida " finally ended . If there was a soundtrack to Hell , that was the first song on the tape . Evidently followed by " Horse with No Name . " Quinn fought down the urge to bolt for the door . " Oh , I love this song , " said Felicia , mouthing the words with those frosted lips : " been to the desert on a horse with no name . . . ' It 's by America , " she whispered to Quinn , as though passing on the location of the Holy Grail . " I know , " Quinn said . " I was there the first time around . " " Quinn was alive during the real Summer of Love , " Bobby said proudly . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stared at Quinn , mouth open , yellow flower frozen . " Not exactly , " said Quinn . " I was eleven years old at the time  --  little too young for the love-in . I was still playing with firecrackers and my GI Joe . " " I do n't believe in war toys , " declared Felicia . " Quinn 's cool , " Bobby said to her . " Not like those geezers walking around in Docs and black leather saying def ' and whazzup , homey ? ' I hate those guys . " " Groovy , " said Quinn . Bobby looked blank . " He 's teasing us , " explained Felicia.  | " What did you want to talk to me about , Bobby ? " Quinn said . " You want some orange spice tea ? " asked Bobby . " They do n't serve alcohol . . . it 's a depressant , you know ? " Quinn looked from one to the other . They were so eager and sincere . He hoped they 'd never wake up , never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Felicia 's in my police-science class at the community college , " said Bobby . " So we can talk around her . " " I 'm pre-med , " Felicia said . " I 'm going to be a forensics specialist . My father 's an OB/GYN , but the hours are too erratic . Women have babies anytime they feel like it , but autopsies are scheduled , " she said , suddenly serious . " Forensics is the way to go  --  you know when you can party , you know when you have to clock in . " Quinn nodded . She made so much sense it was terrifying . Bobby hung over the table , purple fringe dragging across the tabletop , as " Horse with No Name " ricocheted off the walls . Kids at the other tables were actually tapping their feet to the music . The horror . " Remember Saturday night ? " said Bobby , " you , me , and Gomer ? " " I remember , Bobby . It was only three days ago , I still have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Bobby . " Okay , after Gomer and me ? " " Gomer and I , " corrected Felicia . " Okay , " shrugged Bobby . " Anyway , after we checked out Second Street , which was nowhere , Gomer split and I hiked back to my place . Must have been a couple of hours . Party was still going strong at your old lady 's place . " Quinn looked at his watch . " It was n't until I got up to my room that I scoped the dude in the Mercedes . " That got Quinn 's attention . " Bobby is really good at surveillance , " Felicia said proudly . " I think it 's neurological , a hair-trigger gestalt sensitivity . " She toyed with the fringe on Bobby 's rawhide jacket . " Gestalt is high-level pattern recognition , " she explained to Quinn , " sort of a ? " " I know what it is . " " It 's just something I was born with , " Bobby said shyly , " like knowing when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guide . " " What about the guy in the Mercedes ? " " I think he was the same dude I had seen a couple days before , checking out your old lady 's house . " " You think ? " p 177 " He had a different car last time . A red Blazer , " said Bobby . " I thought he was just waiting for somebody . Then I saw him again Saturday night . I told your old lady the next day , but she blew me off . She still thinks I 'm just the neighborhood kid who never showed up to mow the lawn when he promised . That was n't my fault , Quinn  --  I think I 'm allergic to gasoline . . . or pollen . " He shrugged . " I asked Felicia what I should do . She said to call you . So I did . " " What did he look like ? " Quinn kept his voice even . " It was pretty dark , " admitted Bobby . " He parked between the streetlights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you think ? " " Not particularly , " said Quinn . " You 're sure he was watching Rachel 's house ? " " I told you , I seen him before , " said Bobby . " Saw him before , " corrected Felicia . Quinn kept thinking about his conversation with Katie at the beach , her nervousness about the boy at the front door selling cosmetics , a cute boy who preened himself while he talked . " Bobby , " he said carefully , " were you still pretty stoned when you saw this guy in the Mercedes ? " " Uh . . . " Bobby shrugged , embarrassed . " Bobby ? " Felicia was annoyed . " Do n't rag on me about a few joints , will you , Felicia ? " " Marijuana shows up in a urine test , " she clucked . Quinn felt relieved . " So Bobby , you come home , it 's dark , you 're tired , a little stoned , you see a guy in a car who looks like another guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hissed Felicia as " Nights in White Satin " came on , a shimmering dream of ancient history . " I love The Moody Blues . " She glared at Quinn . " You are so lucky . You could go to free concerts during the sixties and be naked and no one would bother you . Strangers would give you acid , just give it away , and it was like the best acid in the whole world . " The flower painted on her cheek was cracked . Her lower lip trembled , her dark eyes angry . " What did you people do ? The whole world is fucked up now . Everything costs too much and none of it 's any good . " " Do n't blame Quinn , " soothed Bobby . He took her hand . The two of them , not a wrinkle between them . " He did n't wreck the world  --  it was the other ones . " The other ones ? " Bobby , " said Quinn , trying to get his attention , " the previous time you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was early evening , " said Bobby , " I got out of my night class and did n't want to start my homework . He was just sitting in this red Blazer watching the house . "  | " Was Rachel there ? " " Yeah . They all were . Rachel , Katie , the old guy in the wheelchair ? " " Joe was there ? " Quinn cocked his head . " A man in a wheelchair ? " " That 's what I said . He was on the front porch with your kid . She was tap-dancing for him . Cracked me up . The cabby was there too . Skinny dude looks like he belongs in a Sally Struthers Somalia telethon " ? Bobby sucked in his cheeks . " Rachel brought out this plateful of cookies , but he did n't touch them . Katie and the dude in the wheelchair dove right in , though , both hands . You should have seen it , " he snickered , " it was like an episode of Leave it to Beaver . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Felicia . " There 's a proto-suburban angst permeating every episode . " " Yeah , " said Bobby . " I like Eddie Haskell , too . " " The guy in the red Blazer , he did n't get out of the car ? He just watched the house ? " " Yeah . I did n't think much of it , that first time . It 's a free country , right ? But when I spotted him again Saturday night , I got suspicious . " He glanced at Felicia . " I got a good gestalt . " Felicia caressed his scraggly goatee so tenderly that Quinn had to look away . For a moment he wished that he was young again , starting out fresh . He did n't care if everything cost too much and nothing was any good . Half the fun of being young was thinking you could change all the things that were wrong with the world . " It was nice meeting you , Felicia . " Quinn still was n't sure whether Bobby had seen anything . " Thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " insisted Bobby . " Different car , same dude . I 'm sure of it . I did n't see his face , but I remember his hair . He kept playing with his hair . Both times I saw him . " Quinn stopped . " Show him your notebook , " urged Felicia . Bobby pulled a small police notebook out of his jacket , riffed through the pages . " Young , ' " he read , " real feathery hair , kind of glam , keeps fluffing it out with his fingers . ' " Bobby looked up at Quinn , pleased with himself . Quinn stood up so fast he knocked his chair over . It was a twentyminute drive to Rachel 's . " Hey , " said Bobby , " do n't you want his license plate ? " He tore off a page from his notebook . " I wrote down the license number of the Merce-des . " He grinned at Quinn . " I told you , man , I got an aptitude for police work . "  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rang the bell . She was wearing her striped terrycloth robe belted around her waist . She stared at him through the glass section of the front door , pleasantly surprised to see him , it seemed . When she let him in , Quinn noticed she had n't even deadbolted the door . She looked disappointed when he told her why he was there , watching as he went through the house room by room , checking windows and doors , making sure the outside flood lights were on . Then he went upstairs and secured Katie 's window . Rachel came in and stood beside him . Neither of them said a word . They just watched Katie breathe . After a while they sat on the stairs together . " Bobby was stoned , " Rachel said . " Right ? He said he thought it was the same kid he had seen watching the house last week . Has Bobby ever impressed you as a thinker ? " " A kid fitting the description showed up at your front door Monday . A pretty boy . Katie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why would somebody be watching our house ? " Quinn shook his head . " I do n't know . " They sat at the top of the stairs , listening to the night . They used to cuddle here at the end of the day when they were married  --  it was their spot . Rachel laid her head against his shoulder , and he put his arm around  | her . It seemed like the most natural thing in the world . Katie stirred in the next room . He started to get up but Rachel kissed him , and he stayed where he was , trying not to think where this was leading , which was someplace dangerous . Their first date she had kissed him goodnight and he had ended up spending the weekend , barely coming up for air . Kissing Rachel was so different from kissing Jen . Even after three months together , Jen was still unfamiliar  --  there was a reserve between them , as though each of them was holding back . Rachel parted his lips with her tongue and he blushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girlfriend by kissing his wife . Ex-wife . Maybe if he had to remind himself , he was cheating on Jen . " Come to bed , " Rachel said softly , laying kisses along his jaw . It was like being punched by an angel . " Daddy ? " Katie stood in her bedroom doorway , rubbing her eyes . " Are you staying here tonight ? " He and Rachel nervously moved apart . " Go back to sleep , honey , " said Quinn , getting up to help her slide back under the covers , stumbling , overwhelmed with the sudden eruption of passion between him and Rachel . Their feelings for each other had never gone away , but they rarely acknowledged them . It just made their separation worse . When he got back to the landing , Rachel was making up the bed in the guest room . Perfect . Now the two of them could pretend the invitation never hap-pened . Quinn stood behind her while she worked . " You 've been seeing a lot of Joe , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I think you should . . . discourage that for a while , " he said . " Bobby first noticed this kid watching the house when the two of them were visiting . There may be a connection . " " You do n't live here anymore . " Rachel 's dark eyes flashed . " I 'll decide who visits , not you . " " I 'm still checking out Joe and Hugo , " Quinn said evenly . " Why do n't you wait until I 'm finished ? " " You enjoy investigating people , " said Rachel , " it gives you a sense of power . You ran a credit check on Tynan , did n't you ? Have you done that to all my dates ? " " Just him , " said Quinn . " I thought he was special to you . " " You were afraid he was special . " Quinn did n't answer . " I like Joe , and so does Katie , " said Rachel . " Hugo has a tortured face , p 181 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both welcome in my home . Is that clear ? Good . I 'm going to bed . " Quinn sat in the living room all night with Katie 's squirtgun in his hand . It was a very realistic Dirty Harty look-alike , except that it was made of orange plastic . He kept the lights on low  --  hopefully , anyone checking out the place from the street would see the gun , but not the color . Just after 3 a.m. , a blue RX-7 drove slowly past with its headlights off . Quinn stood up , walked to the door , casually displaying the squirtgun . The RX-7 beeped once and kept driving . No telling who was behind the wheel . No telling if it was just one of the new neighbors . The last time he looked at the clock it was after 5 a.m . He dreamed of pretty boys with dead eyes , asking if Katie could come out to play . . . " Why are you sleeping with my water pistol , Daddy ? " Quinn opened his eyes . Katie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her hair a tangle of curls in the morning light , standing there in her Wonder Woman pajamas with a hole in one knee . " Morning , baby . " Quinn stretched , stiff from sleeping upright in the chair . He squirted a few shots into his mouth . The water was warm . " Daddy ? " " It 's nothing , Katie . I was just playing a game . " Katie watched him with her mother 's skeptical eyes . " Really . " " What kind of a game ? " said Katie . She moved next to him , started to crawl into his lap . " Who wants breakfast ? " Rachel said , coming down the stairs in a striped robe , her hair wrapped in a wet towel . She did n't wait for an answer , breezed past him , leaving a faint wake of Nocturnes . She clattered around in the kitchen , making more noise than she had to brewing coffee . In the bright light of morning , last night 's kisses seemed like a dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Rachel called . Katie stayed next to him . " It 's okay , " he whispered . She scampered up the stairs . Quinn squirted her as she reached the third step , Katie squealing with delight . He walked into the kitchen , watched as Rachel stood with her back to  | him , cracking eggs into a brown ceramic bowl . He put away the squirtgun . It was too tempting . " I think you and Katie should go visit your sister . " " I 'm busy . " Rachel whipped the eggs with a fork . " The sitter is coming in an hour ? " " The sitter almost let this kid in Monday , " Quinn said . " It 's a good thing Katie has some street smarts . " " Katie is a little girl with a healthy suspicion of strangers , " said Rachel , flailing the eggs . " That does n't mean that everyone who rings the bell is a serial killer . " The eggs hit the hot iron skillet with a sizzle . Quinn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spatula . The DMV office in Sacramento had just opened . He picked up the phone . " I 'm not going to argue with you . " " That 'll be a first . " She handed him a cup of coffee . Rachel divided the soft omelette into three plates , called to Katie . Quinn took to his regular seat . Quinn gave the SLAP magazine clearance code to the DMV operator , then read her the license plate number Bobby had given him . Five seconds later she read him the name , age , and address of the registered owner of the gray Mercedes as he wrote down the information . The registered owner was Jack Kyle Liggett , 37 Bay Drive , Newport Beach , born 1-5-37 . Fifty-eight years old , definitely not Prettyboy . Quinn was n't surprised . Prettyboy must steal a car every time he wanted to go for a drive . Next Quinn called the Newport Beach P.D . and asked for the public information officer . It might help if he could find out where the Mercedes had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raced into the kitchen , skirt flying as she sat down . It seemed like only yesterday she hated dresses , insisting on the same jeans-and-t-shirt look that Quinn favored . " Bill Dudley , public information , " said the chipper young voice at the end of the phone . " Could I speak to officer Avilla ? " asked Quinn . " She 's transferred , " said Dudley . " How may I help you , sir ? " Quinn identified himself , said he was working on a story for SLAP and needed to know if a Mercedes sedan , license number 863 YSA , had been reported stolen . " I 'm a writer myself , " Dudley said cheerfully , keystrokes beeping in the background . " Poetry mostly . SLAP does n't publish poetry , does it ? " " Ah . . . no . " " Too bad . " There was a moment 's silence . " Nope . No GTA report on an 863 YSA . Sorry . " He cleared his throat . " Glad to help a fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correct spelling of my name ? It 's D-U-D-L-E-Y . As in Doright . ' I get a lot of kidding about that around here . " " Hang tough , " said Quinn , starting to hang up . " Wait . Gee , this is embarrassing , " said Officer Dudley . " The report was right in front of me , but in my defense , it was n't a Grand Theft Auto . Are you still there ? " " What 's the matter ? " said Rachel . " Do n't you like the eggs ? " " I 'm still here , " said Quinn , putting down his fork . " Early this morning the Santa Ana P.D . found a white Mercedes , California license plate 863 YSA . The car is registered to a Jack Kyle Liggett , but they have n't officially identified the body in the trunk . " " Thank you . " Quinn hung up . Pushed aside the eggs . " Do me a favor , Rachel , and take Katie to the campus with you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mama , " said Katie . " Please , please , please ? " Rachel saw the expression on Quinn 's face and nodded . It looked like a street fair as Quinn approached the dead-end street in Santa Ana where the Mercedes had been found . The road was blocked off with police barricades , throngs of people stood gaping at the cops , calling out insults and suggestions in Spanish , Vietnamese , and English . Pushcart vendors sold fried bananas , mango snowcones , and Asian pastries . The crack dealers had moved a couple streets over , taking the opportunity to work the four-lane Grand Avenue now that the available officers were busy . John D. Rockefeller would be proud of their initiative . Quinn flashed his press pass to one of the cops stuck with crowd control . " Any word on the guy in the trunk ? " The lanky officer adjusted his Ray-Bans . " White male . Fifties or sixties . Hard to be sure at this point . Looks like he was pistol-whipped , then shot twice in the face . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against his hip as he watched the street . " Cooking for a few days in a trunk did n't help his appearance any , either . You ever play Mr. Potato Head when you were a kid ? That 's him . " " Forensics come up with anything on the vehicle ? Prints ? " " How long you think a Mercedes stays a virgin out here ? " asked the officer . " Look at it  --  no tires , no seats , no CD player , no phone . They crowbarred open the trunk , pushed aside the body , and stole the jack and spare . Finders , keepers . " He sidled toward the shade , eyeing a girl with a dripping snowcone . " What we got here is another carjacking , and a citizen who did n't hand the keys over fast enough . Stupid . You want to do some good , tell your readers that the coroner sees way too many heroes . " Quinn drifted along the edges of the crowd . He spotted a chubby white  | boy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mouse t-shirt . He sat on a skateboard , smoking a cigarette butt , holding it with his fingertips like a joint . The boy had a Mercedes hood ornament on a leather thong around his neck . Quinn sat down beside him . The boy jumped , but Quinn held him in place with one hand . " I 'm not a cop , " said Quinn . " Get your fucking hand off me then . " Heads turned . " Maybe we should call a cop ? " said Quinn , not raising his voice . " Show him your necklace ? " " They already done asked me about it , " sneered the boy , showing his brown , dirty teeth . Somebody had taken a Magic Marker to his t-shirt so that Mickey had a black eye and vampire fangs . " I told the pigs I found it lying in the street . They ca n't prove different . Neither can you . " " The way I see it , " said Quinn , " the first half hour , nobody would touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ player . After a while , though , somebody would come by , maybe cruise past on their skateboard , grab something quick and easy . . . " " I told you ? " " Yeah . You found it . I 'm just saying , if it was me , I 'd grab something nice , like a gold-plated hood ornament . The older guys would come later , take the CD and the seats and anything else they could find , but if I was small and smart and quick , if I was the first one on the scene " ? he bounced the necklace ? " I 'd get me one of these . " " Yeah ? " " Yeah . " Quinn held out his last twenty . " What did he look like ? " " Who ? " Quinn stood up , put the twenty in his pocket . " Wait , " the boy jumped to his feet . " He was a white dude . Young . Looked like a hustler going to court . You know . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the twenty . He was going to have to call Rachel , make sure she did n't go home after work . " Hey , mister ? " The boy held out a blood-crusted medallion . " How much for this ? " Quinn took it from him , holding it gingerly . It was a retired police officer emblem . " I pried it off the rear bumper , " the boy said proudly . " It 's a real collector 's piece . How much you give me ? " Quinn stared at the cracked metal in the palm of his hand . It was still warm from the boy 's pocket .  | Quinn had been waiting on Joe 's porch steps for over an hour in the late-afternoon heat , sweat trickling down the back of his neck . He hardly noticed . He had called Rachel right after he saw Jack Liggett 's Mercedes , and convinced her to go to her sister 's house directly from work . Do not go home . Do not collect $200 . Quinn made more calls , learned that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nice car for a retired civil servant . There was still no answer at any of Jen 's numbers . He did n't like it , but it was n't uncommon for her to work days at a time , sleeping in the darkroom , not answering her pager . An ice cream truck rolled slowly down Joe 's street , the driver speeding up now , clearly uncomfortable with Quinn 's stare . Joe lived on a nice block , the houses freshly painted , lawns mowed , birds singing in the trees . Main Street U.S.A. Wait around long enough and a parade would come by , beauty queens waving to the neighbors . Quinn did n't believe it . He walked along the side , looked into the backyard through the fence . He could see a chin-up rack , the metal bar shiny from use . A white beach towel was draped over the chaise lounge , purple flowers floating in the murky waters of the swimming pool . Bali Hi . He went back to the front porch . Quinn had driven to the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stairs to his usual floor : the reference section . He had spent a lot of time on the twelfth floor , following the paper trail that was part of every story , every criminal investigation . Ten minutes later , still panting from the stairs , Quinn was seated in the newspaper morgue , scrolling through microfilm copies of thirty-year-old papers , fingers twirling the dials of the machine so rapidly that the print was a blur . He forced himself to slow down , blinking into the screen . The September 23 , 1962 , issue of the L.A. Times had reported Sweetie 's murder on page B3 , a brief , two-inch story with a minute photo of the deceased , Adeline Gibson , a corn-fed blonde from Indiana who had moved to California to break into movies . The other two newspapers simply noted the death in their crime wrap-up , not bothering with a photo . It had been a big news day  --  Chubby Checker was in town , hosting the world 's biggest " Twistathon " outside of City Hall . Two days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was now a B1 story , above the fold , with three photos . The first photo showed Sweetie in her high-school cap and gown . The second was from her modeling portfolio . She had sleepy eyes and a perfect smile . It was the third photo that warranted the increased coverage  --  a picture of a handsome , young black man : Jamie Ledbetter , aged twenty-five , described as " the accused , the musician-boyfriend of the murdered starlet . " There was no mention of Neil Stimmler . Sweetie had lived in a one-room apartment in a seedy building , doing temp work during the day while waiting for MGM to call . She had a lover whom no one had ever seen , although the couple next door had frequently banged on the adjoining wall to get them to quit fighting . A week before her murder she had complained to a friend at work that she was breaking up with her " loser boyfriend . " The manager had used her pass key to enter the apartment after complaints of a bad odor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dressed in only a black brassiere . She had been strangled . Since the door was locked , and the deadbolt turned , police concluded that the killer had a key . Though some of Sweetie 's personal effects were missing , robbery was not considered the motive . Jamie Ledbetter 's photograph had been found in Sweetie 's purse , his phone number written on the back , surrounded by hearts and Xs and Os . The wallet still containing $47 and a laminated perfect-attendance card from St. Peter 's Cathedral , Tallon , Indiana . When he was picked up , Ledbetter had a key to Sweetie 's door on his keyring . Although admitting to a relationship with her , he said they had n't seen each other in a week , a story he recanted after the police  | informed him that " physical evidence " linking him to the victim was the same as his bloodtype . Ledbetter then admitted to visiting Sweetie the night she was murdered , but swore he was innocent , insisting that he and Sweetie had n't broken up  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trial , Ledbetter 's police interrogation was trotted out , his lies and equivocations . The prosecutor demanded that Ledbetter return Sweetie 's class ring to her grieving parents , seemingly as outraged at Ledbetter 's denial as by the murder itself . The defense offered two witnesses , fellow musicians , who testified that Ledbetter had been with them at the time of Sweetie 's death . The prosecutor destroyed their credibility with a sneer and a brusque recitation of their minor criminal records . The jury was out less than an hour . They recommended the death penalty . The judge obliged . Quinn sat with his back against the wall , pulling up blades of grass , splitting them with his thumb without looking , watching both ends of the block . You had to keep your eyes open . If Jamie Ledbetter had been as careful , things would have been different . Sweetie had been a good Catholic girl with two secret lovers : Neil Stimmler and Jamie Ledbetter . A pickpocket and a black man . Hard to explain either of them to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other . Ledbetter never mentioned the existence of another boyfriend at his trial . He had n't known . What seemed obvious thirty years later was that Stimmler had killed Sweetie when she ended their relationship , and Jamie Ledbetter was an innocent man sentenced to death . Just like Joe Steps . Quinn waved away a fat bumblebee . He had left a request on Tina Chavez 's voice mail at the D.A . ' s office . He wanted to know if Jamie Ledbetter had been as lucky as Joe , if he had gotten his sentence reduced to life imprisonment . Tina would be able to find out fast . Quinn tossed aside a knotted blade of grass and was on his feet before Hugo 's cab had even rounded the corner . He waited while Hugo lifted Joe out of the backseat and into the wheelchair , Joe wincing with every movement . " We need to talk , " Quinn said to Joe . " Yeah ? I 'm going to take care of my business first , " said Joe . He slapped Hugo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone , damnit . I 'm a cripple , not an infant . " He grunted up the ramp , unlocked the front door , shaking with the exertion , then rolled inside and slammed it after him . " What do you and Joe do all day ? " Quinn said to Hugo . " I called the  | cab company  --  they said you do n't have to submit a daily log since he 's paying a flat rate . Must be nice to be on your own . " " Mostly we just drive , " Hugo said , " two or three hundred miles some days . Joe wants to catch up on what he had missed , waterfront houses , new freeways , shopping districts . We spent all day at the orthopedist . He 's getting worse . I wish he 'd complain  --  I see him in the rearview biting his lip , but he never says a word . " " Maybe you should keep your eyes on the road , " said Quinn . Hugo blinked , uncomprehending . " You would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said evenly . " Doctors wo n't touch you without health insurance . " " I think I 'm going to go now , " said Hugo . Quinn stared at Hugo , seeing him again that night on the Seal Beach pier , stepping out of his cab , all arms and legs , a scarecrow under the harvest moon . " I have to go . " Hugo shook Quinn 's hand with his icy grip , the gesture curiously formal . Quinn heard the front door open , the sound of the wheelchair going down the ramp , but he did n't turn around until the cab was out of sight . " How well do you know Hugo ? " he said as Joe rolled up . " What are you asking ? " said Joe , his hair freshly combed , his eyes suddenly wary . " If I know you , you already looked into the matter . Am I right ? " " You get out of prison , and a few months later the two of you are driving around like Thelma and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won-der . " He checked the street . " Hugo 's got no credit problems , no warrants , no criminal record ? " " Hey , do n't hold that against him , " Joe grinned . " It 's not that simple , " Quinn snapped . " There 's a hole in Hugo 's life , a twenty-year gap . He 's got no health insurance , no medical history that I could find . I 've seen a fax of his birth certificate , I 've seen his elementary school report cards , but his records all stop after fourth grade . I thought maybe the real Hugo Ganz had died  --  sometimes people who want a fresh identity pick up one from a dead child , but there was no death certificate filed . Then three years ago Hugo pops up like a mushroom after a rainstorm . Where was he ? " Joe watched him . " Hugo is a lifer . He 's never been in prison , but he 's done time . I recognized that the first time he picked me up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hugo got hit in the head with a baseball bat when he was nine years old , " Joe explained . " Getting hit . . . it made his brain not work right . He  | did n't recognize his mother or anyone else . People would speak to him and he would just stare . Hugo told me words sounded like rushing wa-ter . " Joe shrugged . " After a while , they dropped him into a nuthouse and forgot about him . A few years ago something clicked in his head . No reason for it , the words just snapped into place again . The state wanted to cut him loose , but there was no place for him to go . Finally , one of those Goody Two-shoes outfits stepped in , put him in a half-way house , paid for a driving course ? " " What was the name of the institution he was in ? " said Quinn . " Where was it ? If you gave me the name of the mental institution , maybe I could confirm his story . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't need confirmation . I can spot a phoney . I still have my instincts . What 's your problem anyway ? You look like somebody shot your dog . " " I do n't have a dog , " Quinn said . Joe 's vagueness and equivocations just made him more suspicious . " Somebody shot Jack Liggett , though . Does that count ? " Joe turned his chair into the setting sun  --  his eyes were slits as he basked in the golden dying light . " Jack who ? " " Liggett . He was a vice cop in LA about thirty years ago . Up until a few days ago he had a good address and expensive taste in automobiles . " Quinn stepped between Joe and the sun . " I thought a big-time gambler like you might have known him , rubbed shoulders at Santa Anita . " " I knew lots of cops , I did n't keep track of them . " Joe looked up at him . " This Liggett , he 's dead ? " " Very . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubbed his knees . " I 'm not sure yet , " Quinn said seriously , " but something is going on , and I think you know what it is . " " You overestimate me , Slick . " " I do n't think so , " said Quinn . Someone was dribbling a basketball down the street , but he kept his eyes on Joe . " I was so happy to see you at Katie 's dance recital , " he said , seeing Joe once again in the spotlight , waving to the applause . " I could n't believe it  --  Joe Steps , my hero , come back to life . You remember that night on the pier , Joe ? That was the night Teddy was murdered . " " I remember , " Joe said softly . " Watch out for Fontayne , ' that 's what you told me at Teddy 's grave , " Quinn said bitterly . " I did n't need much encouragement  --  I did n't like Fontayne , but maybe somebody should have warned me about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? "  | " It was your conversation with Neil Stimmler in the prison hospital that got me interested , " said Quinn . " I kept wondering , what could have been so important ? ? guy on his deathbed , he 's not going to waste his time talking politics or who 's going to the Superbowl . Then when Stimmler turns up dead . . . " Joe looked surprised . Quinn did n't know what to make of that . " You remember Stimmler , do n't you Joe ? He 's the guy who killed Sweetie . " " I know who he is , " Joe said cooly . " I did n't know he was dead . " " It 's not too late to send flowers , " said Quinn , " Stimmler was found dead just last week . " He bent over Joe , putting his hands on the arms of the wheelchair , crowding him . " You see a pattern here ? First Teddy . Then Stimmler . Now Jack Liggett . How am I doing , Joe ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm just getting started . When I figure out why Teddy was killed , why Stimmler , why Liggett was murdered , then you can be impressed . " " Back off , will you . " Quinn stayed where he was , breathing in Joe 's face . " I looked into Stimmler , and I found Sweetie . I looked into Sweetie , and I found Jamie Ledbetter . " The two of them were inches apart , panting with anger and frustration , neither of them wanting to take the first punch . Two of a kind . " I still do n't know what this is all about , Joe , but I think if I keep looking , I 'm going to find you . " " I do n't know any Jamie Ledbetter or Jack Liggett , " said Joe . " Honest to God , Slick . " " What did Neil Stimmler tell you in the hospital ? " said Quinn . " What was so important ? " " That 's none of your concern . " " Wrong , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheelchair . " Two days ago , Katie had her first gentleman caller . Young guy , knocking on the front door  --  more of a boy than a man , but he was man enough to kill Jack Liggett and stuff him into the trunk of his car . " The color drained from Joe 's face like a plug had been pulled . " Katie was home when the boy came by , " Quinn said angrily , " just her and the baby-sitter . Katie did n't let him in . What do you think he might have done if she opened the door ? " " You got her someplace safe now ? " demanded Joe . " Her and Rachel ? You got them out of there ? " " What do you care , Joe ? " Quinn taunted . " You do n't know anything . Right ? " Joe suddenly smacked Quinn 's arms apart . Quinn fell forward into Joe 's lap . Joe grabbed his head in his strong hands , held him tightly . " You p 191 want me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you answer me  --  Katie and Rachel , you got them out of there , did n't you ? They 're safe ? " Quinn struggled , grunting , but could n't get any leverage as Joe slowly twisted his head backwards . " Yes ! " he gasped and Joe released him . He lay on the ground , the sky spinning .  | Jen ? " Quinn listened at the outer door of one of the SLAP magazine darkrooms . No answer . He cautiously entered and closed it behind him . Utter darkness , not even a crack of light from outside . He knocked at the inner door . " Jen ? " There was only the sound of running water . He opened the door , walked into a dim red haze , the air thick with chemical smells , feeling his way , moving slowly as though through glycerine . " Just a minute , " Jen said . Quinn saw her bent over a long , stainless-steel trough , slowly rocking a photographic tray . He smiled , imagining her as a prospector panning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung another eight-by-ten on the line , brushing against him as she did . He could smell the citrus tang of stopbath in her hair , saw water dripping off the shadowed prints , falling onto the black rubber mat on the floor . " Be right there , " Jen said over her shoulder , busy now at the enlarger . Quinn watched her work , enjoying the smooth precision of her movements as she slid photographic paper into the easel under the dim red light . It was a pleasure watching someone good at her job , someone who knew what she was doing , and why , never entertaining any doubts of the value of what she did . " How did you find me ? " asked Jen . " Armando told me . He saw your car . " p 193 " Who 's Armando ? " " The new night guard in the parking structure . " Quinn knew the name of all the security guards on every shift , knew which sports teams they followed . He knew all the receptionists and cleaning staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the names of their husbands and kids . He listened to their advice , laughed at their bad jokes , the way they laughed at his . " I 'm not complaining , " said Jen , standing on her tiptoes to kiss him . " I 'm glad you found me . " He felt her full lips part , his eyes half shut now . He froze . " What is it ? " She pulled back an inch . He stared at the prints dangling by one corner from the clothesline overhead , saw Fontayne 's patrician face gazing back at him . Under the red safelight , Fontayne appeared to be in fire . " Quinn ? " He pointed to the photographs . " When did you shoot these ? " " Yesterday afternoon . Why ? " Quinn touched the wet photos by the edges . Fontayne was his usual chipper self , but some of the photos showed a softer side , his dapper polo shirt and chinos out of place in the crumbling urban landscape where Jen had photographed him . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You do , huh ? " She pushed his hand away from her photos . " Good . Now when I need someone to schedule my calendar , I 'll know who to contact . " She turned back to the enlarger . " Until then , keep your suggestions to yourself . " " It 's not a suggestion , " Quinn said to her back , " it 's a request . I 'm trying ? " " You 're trying to run my life . " Jen whirled and Quinn took a step backwards , hitting one of the red safelights that dangled overhead , throwing shadows across the darkroom . " You 're trying to tell me who to see , who to photograph . What 's next ? " Quinn held his hands up in mock surrender . " It 's just that I do n't trust Fontayne . He set off alarm bells in me the first time I saw him . " " We 've already been through this ? " " I talked to Joe Steps a couple of hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is up to something , too . " " Up to something ? Well , that 's specific . " Jen stood in the wildly dancing light . " You consider Joe Steps a reliable source ? A man convicted of a double homicide ? " " That 's not what is important here . "  | " I 'm sure you 'll tell me what 's important . " " Jen , please ? " " Does Joe Steps have any reason to mistrust Fontayne ? " Jen said sarcastically . " Or is he operating purely on gut instinct like you ? " " I do n't know , " admitted Quinn . " He did n't want to talk about it . He spent a lot of years keeping his own counsel . " " I see , " said Jen . She did n't . Jen walked to the enlarger , opened the paper safe , and took out a sheet of photographic paper . " So you still think Ellis is involved in Teddy 's murder ? " " I 'm still putting things together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the easel , trying to get it to fit . " You know , if anyone looks suspicious here , it 's your friend Joe Steps . You told me that he and Teddy had problems ? " " That 's not true . " She jabbed the paper into the easel again , her hands strangely clumsy . " Teddy told you Joe Steps had been killed in a car wreck , " said Jen . " Teddy refused any contact with him . Would you describe that kind of relationship as close ? Would you describe it as honest ? " Quinn did n't have an answer . " Joe Steps is the one who just got out of prison , " said Jen , " not Fontayne . " " I trust Joe Steps , " said Quinn , " that 's what counts . " The photographic paper creased as she tried to shove it into the easel . She ripped it out , balled it up , and threw it into the waste can . She looked wild in the red light . " Where were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why you 're so mad at me ? " " I thought you were going to come over . " The two of them were almost shouting now . They might as well be married . " Something more important come up ? " " What does that mean ? " " Were you at Rachel 's last night ? " " Someone had staked out her house , " said Quinn . " I think it was the same guy who killed Teddy . " " Now Fontayne wants to kill Rachel , too ? " Jen shook her head . " Do you have any idea how idiotic that sounds ? " " I did n't say that . " He ran a hand through his hair , shrugged . " I told you , I 'm still working on it . " " I 'm sure you are , " Jen said sarcastically . " I can just see you last night , showing up at Rachel 's doorstep to save her from the forces of evil . " She  | batted her eyelashes at him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The clothesline of Fontayne faces bounced slightly , watching , seemingly enjoying what they were seeing . " You do n't have anything to be jealous of , " said Quinn . " I asked you to marry me . Does n't that mean anything ? " " Oh , thank you . What an honor . " Quinn had to smile . " You miss your family , " said Jen , serious now . " You think you can start over again with me , but I 'm not Rachel . " " You 're the one I want , Jen . " Quinn moved toward her but she pulled back . " You do n't know what you want , " said Jen . " Rachel and Katie are going to Paris . Your solution is for us to go to Paris , too . " She shook her head . " You do n't need me for that . You 're going to go there anyway , sooner or later . I 'll probably give you a ride to the airport , too . Why not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're talking crazy ? " " Leaving your wife is one thing , leaving your kid , that 's different . That 's not so easy , is it ? " " I did n't leave Rachel . She left me . " " That 's your defense ? " Jen laughed , tears running down her face . " Oh , that changes everything , now we 're really in love . Now we can get married . Somebody call a priest ! " He reached for her but she shook him off . " You said someone was staking out Rachel 's house , " she said fiercely . " Did you think maybe they were waiting for you , Quinn ? Maybe they thought you still lived there ? Or maybe they knew you spent a lot of time there ? " " I do n't ? " " If someone is really after you , then anyone near you could be in danger , " said Jen . " I could be in danger . " Her voice was low and steady , talking to him like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ever think of that ? " " No . " " Do you ever worry about me the way you worry about Rachel and Katie ? " " Jen ? " " If Rachel and Katie were on a plane , " she said softly , " and you knew the plane was going to blow up , and there was nothing you could do about it , absolutely nothing  --  would you want to be on that plane , sitting next to them , holding their hand ? "  | " That 's a stupid question . " " You would , would n't you ? " she insisted . " Would n't you ? " He nodded . " If it was me on the plane , " Jen said , her voice a husky whisper now , " what would you do ? " Quinn did n't answer . " Exactly , " said Jen . " What would you do if it was me ? " demanded Quinn . She put both hands on his chest and he was n't sure if she wanted to embrace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the ground , " she said , " just like you . " She looked up at him with those green eyes and he felt himself lost at sea , the two of them drifting farther and farther apart . " I wo n't let anything bad happen to you , " he said . " That 's why I 'm here . " " I do n't need you for that , " she said sadly . " I can take care of myself . Go home , Quinn . Go back to Rachel and Katie . " " I want to stay with you . " She shook her head . " You 're not here , Quinn . You 're already gone . You just do n't know it . " " Do n't throw me out , Jen . Please . " She put a finger to his lips , the two of them crying now . " I could n't do that , even if I wanted to . You already decided . Go on , go home . " Quinn held on to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chest . He did n't have anyplace to put his . They stayed like that , in each other 's arms , the two of them almost dancing under the red light .  | Where 's my burrito ? " Vince Boyle said as Quinn slid into the passenger seat of the unmarked police car , a gray Plymouth parked across from the Blue Flu bar . " You said you 'd bring breakfast . " Quinn held out a Tic-Tac but Boyle swatted it away . Even this early , the Laguna Beach traffic was backed up on Pacific Coast Highway . Everyone was looking for a parking spot . Quinn had left his Jeep behind a hippy health-food store , hopefully protecting it from being towed away by plastering the bumper with " Meat Is Murder " and " Death Begins in the Colon " bumper stickers . He kept a supply of different political and social stickers in the dash for these occasions . Boyle had simply commandeered a Handicapped Zone . " You 're going to like Wild Bill . " Boyle shook a bag of nacho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spilling half of them down his shirt . " Just do n't piss him off . You got a way of doing that , anybody ever tell you ? " " Not that I recall , fatso . " " Wise guy . " Boyle chewed with his mouth open , belly bouncing against the steering wheel . His head was small on a thick neck , tiny ears flattened against his skull . He wore a wide tie with a crude , hand-painted bathing beauty and the same baggy corduroy sport coat that he had on at Teddy 's house . It had been almost two weeks since the murder , the D. A. and the network news teams moving on to other crimes . It still seemed like yesterday to Quinn .  | It was a clear , blue Thursday morning , with a cool breeze off the ocean and seagulls wheeling overhead . The beach was a mosaic of colored towels , perfect bodies centered on the terrycloth , shiny with oil . Gangly youths lined the basketball courts , bare-chested pickup players with zinc oxide warpaint squatting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew how they felt . Boyle dug around in his ear with his pinkie as he tracked a rollerblader in a fuchsia thong . There were cornchips stuck in his grin . " It 's a beautiful day in the neighborhood . " Quinn shifted on the sticky plastic seatcovers , sweating in his jeans and black Harley Davidson t-shirt . The t-shirt lowered his IQ fifty points , but he was still too smart for his own good . He had been awake most of last night , replaying what Jen had said to him in the darkroom , telling himself she did n't know what she was talking about . Just this once . " We going to sit here all morning ? " he said , impatient to get things moving . Boyle wiped his mouth with his necktie and opened his door , cornchips falling off his lap and onto the pavement . He did n't even bother to look before crossing the street . Nice to have a charmed life . Or maybe Boyle just did n't care . Seagulls swooped down and fought for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one of them was left , gorging on Boyle 's debris . The Blue Flu was a cop bar , a concrete-block bunker overlooking the swelter of main beach . Inside it was cool and dark . Quinn could see a pool table in the back room , a lazy game in progress . The bartender stared at him from the far end , a hulking man in a pink , pearl-button western shirt , his face in profile . " That 's him , " Boyle said , nodding at the bartender . They sat at the bar , listening to the talk show shrink on the radio as Wild Bill made his way toward them . The shrink used the word " empowerment " three times in one sentence . Quinn counted . A matchstick electric chair sat next to the cash register , a Gumby doll in the hotseat , arms and legs wide . The wall behind the bar was papered with " Wanted " posters with the faces Xed out , signed and dated by the arresting officers . Fourteen of the posters bore the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charged with murder . " Morning , Vincent . " Wild Bill poured Boyle a double bourbon , and slid Quinn a cup of black coffee without asking . Quinn tried not to stare . The left side of the bartender 's face , the half that had been turned away before , was a mass of crawling pink scar tissue , his left ear shredded , the left eye . . . Quinn smiled in spite of his revul- p 199 sion . The eye was fake , a tiny Texas state flag waved where the iris should he . " Remember the Alamo , " Quinn toasted the glass eye with his coffee , grateful for the steam that obscured his vision . Boyle guffawed . " Bill , this here 's ? " " I know who he is . " Wild Bill 's voice had a moist , spongy quality to it , like he had lost his palate in whatever had cost him half his face . His mouth twisted ... it vaguely resembled a smile . In the silence , Quinn heard the shrink on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Hey Bill , throw a pizza in the micro , " said Boyle . Wild Bill shook his head . " Not with your cholesterol , Vincent . How about a veggieburger and sliced tomato ? " " You sound like my old lady , " growled Boyle , " worried about fat and salt and stress . She 's always listening to that know-it-all babe on the radio , too . That 's your problem , Bill . You 're getting too much free advice . " Two uniformed cops came out from the pool room . The white one hurriedly threw a few dollars on the bar . The black one stopped next to Boyle , flicked his grimy necktie . " That 's quite a cravat , Boyle . You 're a credit to your race . " Boyle waved his hands , mocking fear . " Please , Mr. Po-leece , ca n't . . . ca n't we all just get along ? " The uniforms and Boyle roared with laugher , pounding each other on the back while Quinn and Wild Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two pussies to their cruiser , " Boyle said to Quinn , wiping away tears . " You and Bill have your talk . " Quinn waited until the door closed . " Boyle said you were LAPD during the sixties , " he said quietly . " He thought you knew Jack Liggett . " Wild Bill stared at him . There was only the sound of his soggy breath-ing . " I do n't have time to ask you to the prom first , " said Quinn . " I 'm tired . You want to help me ? " " I heard you had an attitude . " Wild Bill drank from a glass of club soda , bubbles trickling out the side of his mouth . " Yeah , I knew Jack . Feel better now ? " He was enjoying himself . " We worked the seventy-seventh division , the two of us fresh from the Academy , ready to save the world . Me , I liked being a street cop  --  on my own , never the same day twice . . lack " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth ? " Jack preferred rousting hookers and dopers . " " Do you remember a homicide case . . . maybe thirty years ago , " asked Quinn , " young woman named Adeline Gibson , killed by her boy-friend ? " The name obviously did n't mean anything to Wild Bill . " Sweetie ' ? "  | Wild Bill brightened . " Oh , yeah . Black dude . . . I remember . " " His name was Jamie Ledbetter . " " Yeah . He was a musician , I think . " " You have a good memory , " said Quinn . " Did Liggett ever bust Jamie Ledbetter ? " Wild Bill shook his head . " Who knows ? " " What about a pickpocket named Neil Stimmler ? " Quinn said . " Stimmler was a young guy then , he smoked some pot . . . Did Liggett ever arrest him ? " " Jack made a lot of busts , " said Wild Bill , " I did n't keep track of every skank and lowlife he wrote up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yoke , smoke curling from their barrels , the fabric cut so full that it was hard to tell just how big he was . " Maybe you should have paid more attention , " Quinn said . " Liggett retired early , but he lived in Newport Beach , drove a Mercedes . That 's hard to do on half-salary . Hard for a street cop . Evidently not so difficult in Vice . " Wild Bill smiled . His face looked like something Quinn had seen floating in a bell jar at the forensics lab . " What about Ellis Fontayne ? " " You 're full of questions , are n't you ? " Wild Bill sipped his club soda , bubbles trickling down his chin . " A real thinker . Too many cops come in here , beaten down , burned out . No brain waves . You . . . I could watch you all day . " " You 're easily entertained , " Quinn smiled back at him . " Did Liggett know Ellis Fontayne ? It 's very important ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a round of drinks . Jack drank strictly twenty-year-old cognac on Fontayne 's tab . I stuck with beer . I used to see Fontayne at the courthouse . " Wild Bill dabbed at his drooping lip . " Other attorneys would be lugging boxes of depositions and lawbooks down the hallway , but not him . He had assistants for that . One of them even carried Fontayne 's crocodile briefcase . " His good eye gleamed with humor . " Before crocs were endangered , of course . Yeah , Mr. Ellis Fontayne was a man who liked to keep his hands free . " Quinn had an unpleasant image of Teddy following Fontayne down a marble corrider , footsteps echoing . " I ran a title search on Liggett 's condo , " Quinn said hurriedly . " It 's appraised at over $500,000 , no mortgage outstanding . The money had to come from somewhere . Maybe Liggett did Fontayne a big favor once . Maybe Fontayne was grateful ? " Wild Bill grinned . " Fontayne did n't mess with vice busts , his clients were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little habit of
