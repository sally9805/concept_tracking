Chapter One Washington , D.C. The cross house was twenty paces away and the proximity and sight of it made Gary Soneji 's skin prickle . It was Victorian-style , white shingled , and extremely well kept . As Soneji stared across Fifth Street , he slowly bared his teeth in a sneer that could have passed for a smile . This was perfect . He had come here to murder Alex Cross and his family . His eyes moved slowly from window to window , taking in everything from the crisp , white lace curtains to Cross 's old piano on the sunporch , to a Batman and Robin kite stuck in the rain gutter of the roof Damon 's kite , he thought . On two occasions he caught sight of Cross 's elderly grandmother as she shuffled past one of the downstairs windows . Nana Mama 's long , purposeless life would soon be at an end . That made him feel so much better . Enjoy every moment-stop and smell the roses , Soneji reminded himself . Taste the roses , eat Alex Cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved across Fifth Street , being careful to stay in the shadows . Then he disappeared into the thick yews and forsythia bushes that ran like sentries alongside the front of the house . He carefully made his way to a whitewashed cellar door , which was to one side of the porch , just off the kitchen . It had a Master padlock , but he had the door open in seconds . He was inside the Cross house ! He was in the cellar : The cellar was a clue for those who collected them . The cellar was worth a thousand words . A thousand forensic pictures , too . It was important to everything that would happen in the very near future . The Cross murders ! There were no large windows , but Soneji decided not to take any chances by turning on the lights . He used a Maglite flashlight . Just to look around , to learn a few more things about Cross and his family , to fuel his hatred , if that was possible . The cellar was cleanly swept , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were haphazardly arranged on a pegged Masonite board . A stained Georgetown ball cap was hung on a hook . Soneji put it on his own head . He could n't resist . He ran his hands over folded laundry laid out on a long wooden table . He felt close to the doomed family now . He despised them more than ever . He felt around the hammocks of the old woman 's bra . He touched the boy 's small Jockey underwear . He felt like a total creep , and he loved it . Soneji picked up a small red reindeer sweater . It would fit Cross 's little girl , Jannie . He held it to his face and tried to smell the girl . He anticipated Jannie 's murder and only wished that Cross would get to see it , too . He saw a pair of Everlast gloves and black Pony shoes tied around a hook next to a weathered old punching bag . They belonged to Cross 's son , Damon , who must be nine years old now . Gary Soneji thought he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he turned off the flashlight and sat all alone in the dark . Once upon a time , he had been a famous kidnapper and murderer . It was going to happen again . He was coming back with a vengeance that would blow everybody 's mind . He folded his hands in his lap and sighed . He had spun his web perfectly . Alex Cross would soon be dead , and so would everyone he loved . ( Continues ... )
