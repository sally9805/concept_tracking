<p> A classified study prepared as the basis for the Pentagon 's budgetary planning through the end of the century casts Russia as the gravest potential threat to U.S. vital interests and presumes the United States would spearhead a NATO counterattack if Russia launched an invasion of Lithuania . <p> U.S. intervention in Lithuania , which would reverse decades of American restraint in the former Soviet Union 's Baltic sphere of influence , is one of seven hypothetical roads to war that the Pentagon studied to help the military services size and justify their forces through 1999 . In the study , the Pentagon neither advocates nor predicts any specific conflict . <p> The Lithuanian scenario contemplates a major war by land , sea and air in which 24 NATO divisions , 70 fighter squadrons and six aircraft carrier battle groups would keep the Russian navy " bottled up in the eastern Baltic , " bomb supply lines in Russia and use armored formations to expel Russian forces from Lithuania . The authors state that Russia is unlikely to respond with nuclear weapons , but they provide no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reprise of the Persian Gulf War , a major war with North Korea , simultaneous wars against Iraq and North Korea , coup attempts in Panama and the Philippines , and the reemergence of a hostile superpower  --  Russia , with or without other former Soviet republics  --  capable of threatening U.S. interests around the globe . Elements of the Pentagon document , a copy of which has been obtained by The Washington Post , were first reported this week in the New York Times . <p> Drafted at the direction of Paul Wolfowitz , undersecretary of defense for policy , and Adm . David E. Jeremiah , vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , the seven scenarios were prepared as a major part of the " defense planning guidance , " the cornerstone document in a complex process of Pentagon force planning and budgeting . The scenarios were issued to service secretaries and defense agency chiefs on Feb. 4 and will be used by Assistant Defense Secretary David S.C . Chu to measure the adequacy of 1994 budget requests . <p> Planning for ' Regional Contingencies ' <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has proposed cutting U.S. forces from 2.1 million personnel to 1.6 million , but has resisted pressure for further reductions , saying the United States must remain prepared to respond to " regional contingencies " around the world . The planning document , which was not intended for public disclosure , is by far the most concrete description of such regional contingencies to date and thus appears likely to become a lightning rod for congressional debate . <p> Sen. Edward M. Kennedy ( D-Mass. ) , an advocate of deep defense cuts , said through a spokesman yesterday that the Pentagon plans " appear to be aimed primarily at finding new ways to justify Cold War levels of military spending . " Jeremiah , meanwhile , comes before the Senate Armed Services Committee today for a reconfirmation hearing and is expected to face questions about the planning scenarios . <p> An unclassified draft preface to the seven scenarios describes them as " illustrative " of the demands that might be placed on the U.S. military in coming years , adding , " They are neither predictive nor exhaustive . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as " low , " but goes on to say that economic and political tensions " could compel political leaders to make decisions that appear irrational " and asserts that a Russian invasion of Lithuania " is plausible in light of recent events in the former Soviet Union . " <p> More striking to analysts inside and outside the government has been the Pentagon document 's description of Lithuania as a " U.S. vital interest . " The language of vital interests traditionally describes something that the U.S. government would use military force to protect . Though applying the term to Lithuania , the document , titled " 1994-1999 Defense Planning Guidance Scenario Set for Final Coordination , " does not purport to represent current U.S. policy . <p> National security officials outside the Pentagon sharply disputed the scenario 's premise , noting that the United States never recognized the Soviet Union 's World War II conquest of the Baltic states but steered clear of interference there for fear of nuclear war . One State Department official said the Pentagon scenario " strikes me like being more of a Tom Clancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy said flatly , " We have no vital interest in Lithuania . " <p> The Pentagon withheld comment . <p> " You 're dealing with a classified document , and no one 's even going to talk around the edges of a classified document , " said Col. F. William Smullen III , a spokesman for Gen. Colin L. Powell , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff . " It should come as no surprise to anyone that people in this building are doing planning , and do it routinely . It 's essentially what we get paid to do . " <p> In fact , military officials run war game analyses on dozens of scenarios each year at war colleges and in the planning directorates of unified commands . But the seven scenarios were specifically commissioned in order to identify military " requirements " for the defense budget . <p> Wolfowitz , who requested the scenarios in an Aug. 10 memorandum , wrote that they would " guide program formulation and evaluation . " Wolfowitz asked for two scenarios centering on Russia : a smaller , more rapidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a much larger , more slowly developing threat premised on " reconstitution " of a Russian-based hostile superpower . <p> The reconstitution scenario names no adversary , citing only a " resurgent/emergent global threat , " or REGT . It describes a five-year U.S. buildup that would come in response to a Russian buildup , could exceed peak Cold War levels and could lead to a major global war . <p> The Lithuania Scenario <p> The Lithuania scenario is a potential diplomatic embarrassment , emerging as it has in the aftermath of a joint declaration Feb. 1 by President Bush and Russian President Boris Yeltsin that " Russia and the United States do not regard each other as potential adversaries . " <p> It is also the only European contingency in the Pentagon document . Congressional advocates of drawing U.S. forces in Europe below the 150,000 troop level set by the Pentagon for the mid-1990s can be expected to challenge the realism of the scenario and assert that no plausible mission remains for large-scale NATO forces . <p> Finally , the Lithuania scenario is the most demanding single military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potentially controversial yardstick for the military force required in the late 1990s . A working group from the Joint Staff 's planning directorate , the Defense Intelligence Agency and the office of program analysis and evaluation estimated it would take 7 1/3 divisions , 45 fighter squadrons and six aircraft carriers to fight the Russians , compared to 5 1/3 , 16 and five for North Korea , the next most powerful adversary . <p> Waging Two Wars at Once <p> A senior uniformed planner noted , however , that the scenario involving concurrent wars with Iraq and North Korea would require a larger U.S. force than the Russian contingency . " That 's clearly going to be the long pole in the tent for sizing the force , " he said . <p> Another well-placed officer , asked about the likelihood of simultaneous major wars , replied : " I have never been run over by a truck yet , but to say it 's never going to happen is pretty tough . That 's why I have life insurance , and so do you . " <p> Nearly all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unclassified form in the 1991 Joint Military Net Assessment , an annual review of U.S. military priorities . That document described the Iraqi scenario , for example , as " Major Regional Contingency  --  East " and the Korean scenario as " Major Regional Contingency  --  West . " But the classified planning document goes into considerably greater detail , describing force requirements and logistical time lines . <p> Because all six regional contingencies are based , according to a memorandum from Jeremiah , on " the most current intelligence information and assessments available , " the Feb. 4 document offers a revealing window on the world that Pentagon planners expect to face in 1999 . It is projected , for instance , that by then : <p> North Korea " possesses a limited nuclear capability ( 5-10 weapons deliverable by aircraft or missiles ) . " Iraq , by contrast , which has been the focus of an international anti-proliferation effort , is predicted to have only " possible " possession of " enough fissile material to produce a small number of nuclear explosive devices . " <p> Iraq has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a top-of-the-line model it did not possess in last year 's gulf war . It also has 880 T-72 tanks , compared to 150 estimated today , and about 180 more top-of-the-line Russian combat aircraft than it has in today 's inventory of about 50 . <p> Russia has consolidated control of all former Soviet nuclear weapons and the entire Soviet navy , including the portions now claimed by Ukraine . <p> The United States will have " prepositioned " stocks of equipment in Bahrain , Oman and Kuwait , but is uncertain whether it will be able to strike deals with Saudi Arabia , Egypt , Qatar and the United Arab Emirates . <p> India , Pakistan , Somalia , Israel , Kenya , Djibouti and Ethiopia would grant overflight rights to U.S. warplanes in the event of a war in the Persian Gulf . Iran , Yemen , Sudan and Jordan would not .
