The last man on Earth knew not that he was . Nor would he have cared . He had met very few other humans in his life , and none since his woman coughed herself into silence . How long ago that happened , he did not know either . He kept no count of years , nor of anything else . She lay blurred in his memory , but so did most that was more than a few days past . Day-by-day survival took all his wits and strength , such as they were . <p> She had not been the last woman . That one had died in Novosibirsk . To her it was nameless ; the crumbling buildings simply provided dens and fuel against the winters , with a stock of rats and other small game for her to trap . Her family had laired there until , one by one , sickness or accident overtook each and they became food for the rest . A brother lived long enough that his feeble attentions got her pregnant , but it was a stillbirth and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When she fell and broke a leg she was helpless and starved to death . The small creatures cleaned her bones . <p> The last man was likewise born in what had been a city , in his case Atlanta . He fled it when a gang of cannibals arrived and settled in to stalk its streets and hallways for meat . Several generations ago their sort had been common , but the prey dwindled fast . These few soon perished in various ways . By that time the last man was elsewhere , and thus missed the satisfaction of learning about their fates . <p> In his wanderings he came upon a girl , equally footloose . She fled , terrified . Having eaten more recently , he was able to run her down . But then he was not ungentle , and afterward she accompanied him willingly . He meant a slight added measure of food and protection . <p> She had no name and few words , which she seldom used . His childhood had been more fortunate , leaving him with some language and scraps of tradition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until , lurching and croaking , he and his mate found a swamp . Although risen sea level brought a salt tide upstream twice a day , the water was not too brackish to drink . In and around it , fish , frogs , snakes , insects , worms , roots , tubers , and leaves furnished a meager diet if the pair worked hard at their gathering and trapping . They were unaware of the lead , mercury , and organic toxins not yet broken down . <p> Indeed , had anyone spoken to them of contamination , they would have stared uncomprehending . Plankton , krill , soil requirements , ecological balance , the food chain , its broad and vulnerable base , ozone , greenhouse effect , famine , nuclear warheads , positive feedback , mass extinction were noises they had never heard . Their world was what it was , hot , harsh , mostly parched and bare , scoured by rains that turned the rivers to mudflows and uncovered bedrock to the sky . So had it been and always would be . Once upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once upon a time , " and related stories of a fabulous age ; but as life grew harder and people scarcer , such tales seemed gibberish and were forgotten . <p> The girl became a woman before she really took sick  --  neither had ever been healthy  --  and died . Her infrequent couplings with the man had had no issue . He mourned in a mute fashion . Unsure what to do about the body , he finally dragged it behind a fallen tree at a distance from the brush shelter in which they had dwelt . Whenever he revisited the site , he would squat silent and shyly stroke her skull . In time , boggy ground and thorny overgrowth hid the skeleton , but he continued to eat the grubs he picked out of that log with a certain reverence . <p> Otherwise he lived dumb . His name and most else dropped out of memory . Gaunt , rachitic , rotten-toothed , plagued by recurrent fevers and jaw-clattering chills , he endured for years . He made crude tools , traps , snares out of wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find . Fire was a lost art , but on the rare cool nights he kept warm between layers of bracken . He paid no attention to the mosquitoes that beclouded and feasted on his nakedness ; as for ticks and leeches , he plucked them off and swallowed them , ignoring the festering sores where their heads were stuck . <p> In due course his skin cancers shed their seed into his bloodstream and devoured him from within . All he knew was that he felt increasingly wretched , until he could not crawl more than a few of his own lengths in any one day . <p> Yet at the end a delirious yearning came upon him . Just outside the shelter was a small boulder . He had , in fact , chosen the location because this was a convenient surface on which to crack shells and crania or split reeds for their pith . Now he crept there on all fours . The sky burned pitiless blue overhead . A cypress , dead and bleached white , offered no shade . The edge of the swamp , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rain had fallen during the night and a depression in the cracked red clay held a little water . The man sucked its siltiness dry . His thirst still smoldered , he was crusted and he stank , but his eyes cleared somewhat and he dragged his carcass onward to the rock . Several stones that he had collected lay around it . He took a wedge-shaped one in his left hand and a blunt one in his right . Blow by blow , he chiseled a mark into the boulder : as it happened , an X , unless it was a cross falling down . He could not have done this were the material not soft limestone , and even so , the mark was barely visible . For a spell he stared at it . The breath rattled in his lungs . He crumpled , sprawled , and breathed a while longer , then no more . <p> The undertakers sought to him , ants across the ground , insects from the air . They too had no way of knowing that this was the last man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The continents were more brown than they were green ; rare was the sight of silver slenderness cleaving the seas ; but the desert appearance was deceptive . Only the least hardy animals and plants were extinct . They included the larger sorts and those that humans had considered beautiful , but this was of no serious biological consequence . Bacteria , protozoa , and other microscopic organisms had always outweighed as well as outnumbered everything else alive . Some parasites and disease germs died out with their hosts , but most species found the new conditions to their advantage and proliferated . Tough , scrubby grasses , shrubs , and trees made do . Freed of their warm-blooded predators , many invertebrates underwent population explosions . Amphibians had suffered badly , but various kinds of fish and reptiles survived and started to increase . The same was true of certain birds and lesser mammals , especially rodents . Conspicuous among these were the rats . They had declined after the civilization that nourished them ceased to be , but adapted well to the wild , for they were intelligent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and moon wheeled on their ancient ways . Rain torrented , light blazed , oxygen and acids gnawed . In every crack or corner where a bit of dirt had drifted , seeds arrived , rootlets thrust forth , stalks lifted , and within a year masonry was breaking apart into finer and finer fragments . Termites and dry-rot fungi feasted for a century or more on wood , but when a house fell down it was lichen and moss , grass and thistle that reduced the harder parts . <p> Of course , much resisted . Steel-framed buildings reared as before , perhaps hollowed out but their exteriors merely blotched . The Pyramids of Egypt withstood the flood when the Aswan Dam broke and defied every weather . An explorer would have seen a few other such anomalies scattered around the planet . Small objects held on in large numbers , gemstones , goldwork , ceramics , inert plastics . <p> Time passed . Within a century the bones of the last man were gone , dissolved , taken back into nature . The mark he scratched on his headstone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chemistry proceeded . Impurities were transformed or diluted to harmlessness . The ozone layer thickened again . Excess carbon dioxide reacted with exposed rock to form carbonates . Resurgent plant life took up more . Greenhouse effect diminished and Earth cooled . <p> This actually happened rather fast . High temperatures had evaporated vast quantities of ocean water . Much of this fell as snow on mountains and the polar regions . Not all of it melted in summer . The glaciers grew . They locked up most of the water vapor that is also an important greenhouse gas . Temperatures dropped further . Geologically speaking , the new ice Age came overnight . <p> Glaciers penetrated Europe until they had buried what was left of Bordeaux , Berlin , Warsaw , and St. Petersburg . Local sheets in the Alps accounted for their share . In North America , ice engulfed the reaches once called Alaska and Canada ; the Great Lakes froze to make a foundation for cliffs sheer above the sites of Detroit and Chicago . Except at high altitudes , Asia was too dry for this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear , like South America apart from the Andean heights . The Pacific experienced mainly a fall in sea level sufficient to rejoin Australia to the Indonesian islands ; but icebergs often hove above the Tasmanian horizon . <p> At its mightiest , the glacier in Europe or North America bulked a mile thick . Wind whistled over its wrinkled emptiness , driving snow or a glitter of crystals ; crevasses shone a lovely mysterious blue , but the sun alone beheld . In summer at its edge , streams rushed down the cliffs and out of the caves , down to gurgle among stones , make the ground a bog , and lose themselves in the tundra that stretched on southward . Here grew lichens , mosses , now and then a tussock of grass or a clump of dwarf willows . Mosquitoes bred their billions , darkened the air and sawed lt with their whine . Then the brief season ended , pools stiffened , snow fell anew , starts crowded darkness out of utterly clear nights . <p> Interstadial periods occurred , when for millennia at a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay warm , mist baked out of it , life swarmed in from the south , wildflowers , berrybushes , evergreens , seeding , growing , spreading , until a forest stood with its crowns like an ocean beneath the wind and flying creatures clamorous above . But the glaciers returned , froze the woods to death , crushed them underfoot , ground and scattered further the works of man . <p> This Ice Age lasted three million years . <p> They were by no means evil years for living things . On the contrary , Gaia flourished as she had not since the Pleistocene . Rain belts , forced equatorward , quickened the deserts . The erosion that washed soil down the rivers into the seas nourished them . Meanwhile its forces weathered rock and carried in organic matter to make loam , which roots anchored . Plants and animals multiplied , died , decayed , formed humus to support a life more rich . Volcanoes and ocean trenches brought minerals up from the depths ; currents and winds spread them , microbes concentrated them , larger species used them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet , the sky with wings . Below the tundras and beneath the ranges , forests ran from shore to shore , save where grass billowed or marshes choked on their own abundance . <p> Evolution worked onward . Species diversified , more and more as increasing fertility opened opportunities . Those that were gone never came back , but new ones took their places . Sometimes , to some degree , they resembled the old . Broadleaf trees bore nuts and fruits , flowers bloomed like bits of rainbow , creatures had descendants bigger than themselves , such features as horns or fingers reappeared . However , an anatomist would have found essential differences ; the likenesses were as superficial as those between fish , ichthyosaur , and whale had been . <p> After three million years , secular changes in Earth 's orbit and axial inclination , together with geological and geochemical action , terminated the Ice Age . The glaciers withdrew to the poles and mountaintops . The woods advanced northward and southward over the tundras . They demolished the few shards of human artifacts above ground which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rain and frost did not finish yielded to natural acids or the microbes that had " learned " to eat otherwise resistant synthetic materials . <p> The middle latitudes kept a little evidence of man . <p> The violence of earthquake , eruption , and tsunami had brought many works low , but this was as nothing compared to the patience of weather . There were hills , though , some quite big , where burrowing animals still came upon things that nature could not have made ; in them , the soil usually had a high iron content . The Sphinx was long gone but identifiably artificial stumps of the Pyramids stood in the desolation that had encroached again after the rain belts moved back north . Early on , several tombs in the Valley of the Kings had filled with sand , which during the wet epoch hardened into stone . It preserved their contours and hints of their murals . Similar freaks of circumstance persisted in other corners of the world , far apart . <p> And then there were the fossils , not simply bones and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and petrified . They existed both ashore and at sea ; countless minor items and several almost complete ships lay deep in the silt on ocean bottoms . Other remnants were not , strictly speaking , fossils . A coffee mug , a jade ornament , a metate , a faceted diamond , or the like could stay as it was , encysted in stone , indefinitely . Not every relic dated from historic times . Strata held fugitive memories of the Neolithic , the Paleolithic , or eras even older , a jawbone , a brainpan , a flint pounded to shape by Neanderthal or perhaps Pithecanthropus . <p> Beyond the clouds were clearer traces . <p> No artificial satellite or piece of debris had continued in orbit around Earth past a century or two . Residual friction dragged them down , to flash as meteors or drift as dust . Whatever struck ground fell to the forces that gnawed at everything else . A few bits had escaped the planet , to course about the sun on eccentric tracks of their own , but collisions with asteroidal gravel annihilated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wheel tracks off the moon . Crashed probes , abandoned vehicles , used-up robots , and discarded gear were left , untouched by air , water , or life . The stony rain wore them away , but slowly , slowly , perhaps one really damaging strike in a hundred thousand years . <p> Destruction went a little faster on Mars , which kept a wisp of atmosphere and was nearer the asteroid belt , but only a little . Jupiter had almost instantly reduced all that reached it , and Venus had done so within decades . <p> Time passed . Occasionally during the next thirty million years the ice advanced , but never very far , and each retreat went deeper back . At last none remained except on Antarctica and the tallest mountains . Swollen , ocean drowned many islands and coastal plains . Otherwise it was benign , the source and guardian of climates that held steady from tropical rain forests to the mild northern and southern fringes of the continents . <p> Life forms evolved , had their day , and yielded to successor breeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some radiated into fresh kinds while some kept virtually unchanged for periods that ran into the hundreds of millions of years . From the rats arose creatures that grazed , creatures that preyed on them , creatures that took to the air and became raptors more fearsome than any bird . One branch of the rat family went into the trees and developed hands of a sort . Certain among these returned to the ground and grew large and brainy . None ever put fire to use nor any tool more complex than a carefully chosen stone or a stick sharpened with the teeth . Another branch became aquatic and gained flippers , but the truly gigantic sea beasts were originally birds . <p> A variety of Octopodidae got to outliving their own procreation , and thence to caring for their young and a lifespan that lengthened as generation followed generation . Ultimately there were beings whose tentacles worked rock , shell , bone , and coral . They had language , although its symbols were gestures and color changes . They hatched ignorant and weak , but learned from their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ societies which practiced religious rites and subtle arts . Yet being confined to salt water , they never went technologically beyond their equivalent of the Stone Age . One by one , in different manners around the world , their cultures adapted so well to local conditions that innovation ceased ; caste systems congealed ; the biography of an individual was predetermined within narrow limits and in elaborate detail from the egg to the disposal . Having abolished natural selection for itself , intelligence atrophied . The species grew less and less able to cope with any change in environment . Twelve million years after it came into existence , it was extinct . To be sure , this was a considerably longer run than humankind had had . <p> As for the vestiges of that earlier race , geological vicissitudes pursued them . A river would change course , a land mass rise or sink , a fossil come to light and thus to erosion . For example , a set of footprints was once laid down in muddy ground that got covered over and lithified as shale . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rain filled the prints , algae greened the puddles , the stone flaked and crumbled . In less than a century it had completely lost those traces left by the shoes of George Washington . <p> A few things stayed entombed and lasted immensely longer , fossilized tools or teeth , roadbeds or graves . But the planet querned . Crustal plate shifted ponderous about . When Africa sundered from Asia , the marks of the Pharaohs disintegrated . North America , colliding with northeastern Asia , raised a mountain chain and ground every token of man in those parts to molecules . Seabed relics slipped down subduction zones to be cycled through moltenness . So it went , while the years mounted into the billions . <p> No living things witnessed the end . Since first it condensed from primordial gas and dust , the sun had been brightening . Temperatures on Earth kept remarkably stable . In part this was due to chemistry and physics . More heat evaporated more water , much of which recondensed as clouds and deflected sunlight . Rock exposed by falling sea level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas , carbon dioxide , and bound it . Life was a potent force too . Plants tied up their own carbon , which often stayed in place when they died , were buried , and turned into peat or coal . Plankton exuded substances that contributed to cloud formation . Animals helped maintain the balance , cropping vegetable matter and each other lest one kind overrun the world . <p> Yet at last the input became overwhelming . The tropics steamed dry , wildfire consumed their jungles and savannahs , scorching winds blew the ashes off and left hardpan desert . Soon the higher latitudes went the selfsame way . Vertebrates died rapidly beside the vegetation that had sustained them ; the toughest insects hung on for a span ; finally the microbes succumbed . <p> Primitive , sorely depleted life lingered in the oceans , but not for long . The concentration of water vapor in the atmosphere passed a critical point , and a runaway greenhouse effect set in . The seas began to boil . It took a little time , but by one billion A.D. Earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultraviolet photons that split them apart . Their hydrogen escaped to space , the oxygen united with materials below . Carbon dioxide , roasted out of limestone , stoked the furnace further . The planet did not quite change into a twin of Venus , but the difference was trivial . <p> Volcanoes continued to vomit huge quantities of water from the mantle . It too was lost . Deprived of that lubricant , plate tectonics ground to a halt . Besides , the radioactive elements whose energy had driven the process were giving out . <p> You could not say that continental drift ceased . Lacking oceans , Earth really had no more continents , just massifs in the basins . Unblocked by ozone , actinic radiation spalled them ; wind sanded them ; sometimes a large meteorite smote them . Without water , oxygen , and life , erosion went very slowly . Even after four billion added years , a few mesas stood above silicate wastes . A few rocks contained a few fossils , including bits of degraded organic matter that an observer who knew what to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> When the seas departed , the sun and moon generated less tidal friction . Earth turned more leisurely than aforetime , but it did not go into locked rotation with either body . The distance of the moon varied according to the interplay of celestial mechanics , now greater , now lesser , but it neither crashed into the planet nor wandered free . By five billion A.D. meteoritic bombardment had completely , unrecognizably mingled all human-fashioned things on it and on Mars with their regoliths . <p> That was the approximate time when the sun left the main sequence and swelled to gigantic size . Surface temperature declined until it shone red , like a dying coal , but the whole output was monstrous . At its greatest radius , it ate Mercury and Venus and filled almost half the sky of Earth . The globe glowed , sand fused into glass , the last faint fossils melted and the last biotic molecules broke into their olden elements . <p> Now the sun collapsed . It ended as a white dwarf , hellish hot , its mass crushed into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward oblivion . But this is epilogue and incidental . Nature had already erased from the Solar System every spoor of humanity . We might as well never have been . <p> Many light-years away , on widely divergent courses , Pioneer 10 and 11 , Voyager 1 and 2 , and perhaps some small sister spacecraft fared among the stars . <p> Poul Anderson is the author of such classic novels as Brain Wave , Tau Zero , and Three Hearts and Three Lions . His next novel , Fireball , will be published by Tor Books in the spring of 1993 . This is his first appearance in Omni . <p>
