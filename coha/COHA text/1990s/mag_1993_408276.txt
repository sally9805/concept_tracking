HOW MANY OF YOU love to sit down and read a book ? " asks Diana Rowney , an early childhood consultant in the Toronto Board of Education speaking to a group of parents . All the hands in the room go up . A pause , and then Rowney 's follow - up question : " How many of you love to sit down and do math ? " This time groans echo around the room . No surprise here , right ? For most of us , there 's no love lost for the multitude of pencil and paper calculations that meant math class . Yet in over 800 classrooms across Canada today , a new program called Structures may find its young students answering this question quite differently in the future . The program was developed by Otto Weininger , a child psychologist at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education , in conjunction with a group of dedicated teachers , including Rowney . It is proving so successful that Weininger has had requests for the program from Sweden , Germany , Australia and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is like stepping into a sea of pattern , colour and geometry . Concrete materials have been used in elementary classrooms for some time now , but most often they 've been used to help understand and perform arithmetic tasks on paper . In Structures , the materials are the task . Towers , pyramids , constellations of zig - zag cities sprout from table - tops and platforms . Each child in the class selects a particular building material . The choices range from manufactured construction toys such as Multilinks , Sonos and Polygons to materials such as film canisters and yogurt containers . Figure not transcribed Each child works alone , at least at the beginning , and the building is entirely open - ended  --  the children can use the materials in any way they like . In this grade one/two classroom , it 's surprisingly quiet . Twenty - three kids are busy sorting , stacking , shaping and arranging . This is work which requires a lot of concentration and most children give it quite happily . And they 'll work this way anywhere from one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the program as it gives the children ample opportunity to experiment , build , revise , tear down and build again . The teacher 's job is to put the students ' work into a mathematical framework . As she works her way through the class , speaking to the children about their work , she asks them to describe what they 've built . In turn , she responds by providing them with mathematical language to pin down the concepts that the children are intuitively exploring . Look , you put two triangles together there and made a square . " " Did you notice the parallel order you 've made ? " " You 've made a pattern that is the same on both sides . It 's symmetrical . " We think that one of the difficulties that is occurring in the teaching of math is that there is no mathematical language . " explains Weininger . " If you have no way for the child to converse with you , then how does she begin to think mathematically ? " Using this language , the teacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to explore other ideas . " I notice that you made your house two blocks square and three blocks high . I wonder now if you can build another house using these blocks which are two by two , or two by three . " As the children explore the relationships in their structures , they 're able to discover mathematical relationships that previously may have been purely mechanical operations . Diana Rowney remembers observing one little girl looking intently at the piles of beer bungs she had constructed . " She was figuring out how many she had there when she suddenly burst out " Oh , that 's multiplication ! ' ' " recalls Rowney . " And her teacher replied , " Yes ! And this is how you write it down . ' ' " After children have completed their constructions , they are often asked to make a drawing of them . As they get older , they 'll begin to label the drawings using mathematical language , which in time leads into writing detailed descriptions . By grade six , students can be translating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But as early as grade three or four , new materials can be introduced  --  levers , fulcrums , gears , motors , wires , batteries . For math consultant , Megan Gardiner , the benefits in the program go beyond the distinct math skills children acquire . " It gives kids the opportunities to become more confident , to become better risk takers and to become problem solvers , " says Gardiner . " They ask questions of themselves  --  this is n't working , I 'm going to have to take it apart and do it again . " Taking these risks has a particular importance for girls . Boys seem more naturally drawn to building toys and can spend hours of playtime with them . When girls do play with blocks , it 's often for dramatic play , creating social situations out of the materials rather than building in a way that explores mathematical concepts . Many educators now believe that this lack of experience contributes to a reduced facility with spatial skills and even a generalized math anxiety . " If you drill the mechanics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there will be some understanding , " comments Weininger . " But there is n't really an internalization of this understanding and that 's one of the reasons why I think so many of us have been turned away from mathematics  --  especially girls . " Still , many parents may be skeptical of another educational experiment that on the surface looks more like " play ' than " real school work . " How do the mathematical concepts children are developing in the Structures program translate into pencil and paper number calculations ? When we 've performed the objective tests required by the board of education , " explains Weininger , " these children demonstrate just as skilled learning as a child who 's had solely conventional instruction . " But Weininger adds that the results also show that through Structures , the children are advanced in other areas  --  there 's more thinking going on , there 's more reasoning , and there 's more use of language and math terms in talking about what the student has done . The children look more at mathematics as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - taught kids is now in high school . Their anecdotal information shores up the objective test results in a compelling way . " We 've had kids who were in grade five and six when Structures first began in 1985 come back to talk to us , particularly girls , " explains Rowney . " They 've said " Are we ever glad we had this program . Now we really understand what 's going on and a lot of other kids do n't seem to . ' ' " The National Curriculum for Teaching Mathematics , developed by the US National Research Council , is the basis of curriculum developed across both Canada and the United States . The Council 's 1989 document Everybody Counts : A Report to the Nation on the Future of Mathematics Education , echoes the principles of the Structures program . This report claims that while repetition helps in learning the basic skills , students learn mathematics well " only when they construct their own mathematical understanding .

Math talk Weininger suggests that parents themselves build their own structures and use math words and language to describe what they have built . As children see and hear a parent talking about geometry or numbers , the notion of math becomes more tangible  --  and fun . It 's important , however , that parents avoid becoming the teacher . " It 's really vital that this learning not be forced , " cautions Weininger . " The parent should encourage a child to express his knowledge through building . But it 's better for the teacher to have the role of translating and to be the one to interpret for the child .
