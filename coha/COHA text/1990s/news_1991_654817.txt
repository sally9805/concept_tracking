<p> THE only time I felt heroic using force was in the Swiss Alps when I picked up a man twice my weight and threw him down on the spring cushion of snow . His skis snapped off and one slid into deep snow in the woods and he had to go after it . He had been cutting in line , " hot-dogging , " all morning , but this time he cut in front of a kid from a nearby home for children with special needs . I knew the kid , Frankie , and I always stopped the lift for him . The man 's rooster-tail of snow had made him fall down , and Frankie was too polite to object . <p> I got reprimanded by Swiss authorities for my rash act as the man was a local customer . But they let it go and told me to phone from the lift shack if I had further trouble . I only had days to go as a lift-operator for it was spring and the corn snow in the Alps was almost mush . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid Frankie came back to thank me with his nurse-matron from the home . " You come - please ... to ... tea at my house , some day - OK ? " <p> " Sure , " I said , thinking what a nice kid . But my head was really swimming with dreams of spring now , my seasonal job almost over . My buddies on the mountain were all talking about Greece . We had worked hard each day - riding chairlifts in cold red dawns of winter to our stations - and partied at nights . Now they were going to move the feast somewhere else . <p> I was n't so sure . I had had a good time , found a bed and a job in a foreign country , but my conscience was calling me back - not home yet - but I was hungry for more substance than a beach on Mikonos Island . <p> " Check American Express in Athens , Bwana , " they said to me , the morning my friends deserted our chalet with two nights on the rent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun . I was waiting for mail from the States and opted to close things down at the house . <p> To be young and alone for a few days in spring with the world at your feet , you only had to think of where it was you could be the happiest . The chalet was strange in sudden silence , the living room with the table where we 'd had boisterous spaghetti dinners , the upstairs hall and the clanking and squeaking of boots - all silent now , new spring sun streaming in the windows . I got lonely immediately . I thought of going over to see the kid Frankie at the children 's home , to say goodbye before I left Switzerland - a token gesture - but never got around to it . I bathed and read and went to the patisserie and the lady said , " So Bob is gone . And Jeff ... and your other friends ... ? " <p> SURELY it was time to leave , leave this town to their daily lives , and catch up with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hey , man , " " Let 's do it , " and " Check it out , dude . " So I found a book of T.S . Eliot 's poetry left behind from some other expatriate occupant of the chalet . I opened the book to " April is the cruelest month , breeding/ Lilacs out of the dead land , mixing/ Memory and desire ... In the mountains , there you feel free ... " <p> Lilacs . I packed a knapsack and took the cog-train down to Aigle , the valley , where , I once had read , young Ernest and Mrs. Hemingway had stopped at the " Cafe des Lilacs . " I knew he had read the paper there on the porch and fished the Rhone . The porch and the lilacs were there , in full bloom , as if Hemingway 's supreme style had immortalized them . Sure enough , Marcel the proprietor had never heard of the writer , but was grateful for my interest and French and lent me his fishing rod . I sat with my back to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Les Dents du Midi , beginning to feel Shantihshantih shantih ( the peace which passeth understanding ) at the end of Eliot 's poem . I caught , as Ernest would say , " two good trout . " Marcel cooked them with almonds for me , and I sat on the porch and read the papers . I was glad to be alone , for I felt an imposter - pretending to be part of the 1920s " lost generation " ... thinking long thoughts of the world ... <p> Across from the porch of " Les Lilacs " was the train station . The buses stopped there , beautiful sleek Mercedes coaches . I watched two great electric trains come and go , the buses going up and down the mountain , coming in to meet them . From one train , I watched a woman and a girl , a pretty wisp in white blouse and pinafore , and I could see clearly she had difficulties as the mother helped her onto the bus . I supposed the woman was her mother and something about the girl reminded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master his limbs all winter , under the pines , trailing ski poles on pastures of snow . She 's pretty , I thought , a friend for Frankie , perhaps going to the home . <p> I ate my fish , got a haircut , bought a ticket to the Italian seaport of Brindisi , to Greece , and was beginning to feel the legendariness of my youth again . How could a man feel better ? And only a spring day . <p> I went up the mountain in the evening , prepared to leave the next day . But on impulse decided to get off the bus at the stop where I knew the big safe children 's home in the pines was . I could walk the mile up the road home from there in the dark . <p> Inside , the children were having prayers and supper . It was a well-lit , wood-beamed room , with flowers in the windows and boys and girls eating or being fed at tables . The woman I 'd seen with Frankie on the slopes came to meet me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " It 's good of you to come , " she said . " Frankie has been asking about you for days . He 'll be thrilled . " <p> Frankie jumped up as if he had surprised himself , walked slowly over to meet me , with no other thought but to introduce me to all his friends . He shook my hand , hard . <p> " This is him - my friend , " he managed . <p> It was after supper , and I was about to leave when the matron asked me to stay for the singing . The children sang boisterously and banged glasses for drums , even tapping each other 's wheelchair backs . They sang " Der Wanderer . " <p> " What are you doing this spring ? " asked the matron . " We 've been looking for a maintenance man - oh , just to help with the garden and the older children . " <p> I felt a sudden pang for my plans to go off and be " legendary " alone , to Greece . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depend on where to go , but in who could depend on me . <p> " I think we can depend on you , " said the matron to my protests , smiling . I remember her face - and the kid Frankie 's - as I walked up the road in the dark . All I said was , " Let 's do it . "
