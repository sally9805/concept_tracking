<p> For centuries , the architecture of old Beijing has withstood rebels and invaders , warlords and imperialist powers , Communist central planners and Red Guards . <p> But what those waves of people failed to destroy is now succumbing to a far more powerful force : real estate developers . <p> Giant swaths of central Beijing  --  once lined with single-story courtyard houses , sloping tile rooftops and narrow lanes of gray brick  --  are being demolished to make way for the kind of look-alike high-rise office towers , garish shopping arcades and hotels that have become common worldwide . For the most part , the new construction is hasty and poor in quality ; the builders ' favorite facing material resembles white bathroom tile , and windows are often tinted metallic blue . <p> Over the past two years , the destruction of old Beijing has been picking up speed . For the Financial Street development near the Forbidden City , more than 20,000 homes were razed . Along the Second Ring Road where the city walls once stood , whole blocks have been cleared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new Foreign Ministry building . Plans already approved would wipe out 60 percent of the old structures in one of the city 's northwestern sections . And Hong Kong tycoon Li Kaishing has had a hole the size of Camden Yards dug in the heart of the city , where he will erect a high-rise office and retail complex known as Oriental Plaza . <p> " We 're just destroying the city , " said Lu Junhua , a professor of architecture at prestigious Qinghua University . " It 's not a war . It 's not a revolution . It 's construction . " <p> What is being lost is more than old bricks and mortar , it is the very character of old Beijing . In a vast and autocratic nation , Beijing 's architecture gave its citizens homes , courtyards and streets on a human scale . <p> " The city 's character before was horizontal , " said Zhang Kaiji , former chief architect of the Beijing Institute of Architecture . " Now it 's been ruined by high-rises . It 's become a third-class Hong Kong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls within walls . Within the Great Wall spanning the northern border were concentric rings of walls : the city wall , the courtyard house walls , the walls of the Imperial Palace and , at the center , the deep red walls of the Forbidden City , home of the emperor . Although ineffective as military structures , the walls reflected China 's tendency to look inward rather than out , resist foreign influence rather than welcome it . And at the core of the society lay the Confucian family unit . <p> After the Communists seized power in 1949 , Communist Party Chairman Mao Zedong leveled several neighborhoods to create the vast Tiananmen Square at the city center . Around it , he erected Soviet-style buildings such as the Great Hall of the People . The designs were examined at the highest levels of government ; Zhang , who designed the History Museum and Museum of the Revolution on Tiananmen Square , was pressed by Premier Zhou Enlai to make its columns more massive . <p> Later , Mao ignored appeals from Liang Sicheng , a Chinese architect trained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a city plan in the 1950s . Liang had urged Mao to create a new city outside the city walls to absorb future growth , while maintaining the inner city as a living museum and residential area . The walls , he suggested , could be lined with plants and benches and turned into an elevated park . <p> Instead , Mao ordered the destruction of the massive walls , first built by a Ming Dynasty emperor in the early 1400s , to make way for a ring road . " The city wall was like a frame to a painting , " Zhang said mournfully , " and the gray color of courtyard houses was like the background color . " Only one of the 13 gates in the city walls was preserved . Recently , a small section of the wall has been reconstructed . <p> Despite Mao 's projects , much of old Beijing remained unchanged , with low-lying homes and narrow lanes , known as hutongs , that numbered in the thousands . The courtyard homes , originally constructed for wealthy merchants and high-ranking officials , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ornate door handles and carved stones at the entryways . Wider lanes ran east and west , with smaller ones  --  some barely wide enough for two people  --  going north and south . <p> " The city of Beijing is like a magnified quadrangle , symmetrically and neatly arranged and surrounded rectangularly by high walls , " wrote Xu Yong , a photographer who has documented the old city . " This lends magnificence to the city . " He wrote that in 1990 , when hutong neighborhoods still occupied a third of Beijing and provided housing for half the population . Now these neighborhoods house barely one-tenth of the city 's population . <p> Xu also conducts tours of hutong neighborhoods , but parts of the route are disappearing . One highlight used to be Houhai , a peaceful lake district north of the Forbidden City . Today , Houhai has been marred by destruction to make way for luxury houses . <p> A bus ticket-taker living there has vowed to resist . Sitting in a home surrounded by the rubble of former neighbors ' houses , she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in exchange for another that was confiscated when the Communists took power . <p> The longer she holds out , the farther away city authorities threaten to move her . They have warned they will move her to where the sixth ring road would be  --  if it existed  --  in Beijing 's Dante-esque outer rings of inconvenience . Her son would have no way to get to school , which is now a five-minute walk from home . She would have a long commute to get to work . <p> The Houhai woman is not alone . More people will eventually be forced from their homes in a number of Chinese cities  --  including Shanghai , Xian and Beijing  --  than will be relocated along the Yangtze River to make way for the massive Three Gorges Dam , several analysts estimate . <p> Beijing 's sense of neighborhood and community has been pulverized along with peoples ' homes . Residents used to meet in courtyards , squat on front stoops , play checkers on sidewalks or hug the dark alley walls as they walked or biked home . Now most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illuminated by overhead lights . They arrive at nondescript high-rises that dwarf them and scurry up stairs or ride elevators to their isolating compartments . Communities have been atomized ; the individual is alone . <p> To be sure , old courtyards look more charming from the outside than inside . Homes meant for one wealthy family each have been jammed with more than a dozen families housed in ramshackle additions that fill in much of the original courtyards . Coal briquettes , bicycles , brooms and other household items clutter passageways . The new apartment buildings have more space and central heating , and during the Cultural Revolution of 1966-76 , neighbors could be tormentors or spies . <p> Nonetheless , an opinion survey by Qinghua University researchers indicated that only 20 percent of the people in one new housing project were satisfied with their new homes . Twenty-eight percent said they would to go back to their old homes if they could . The rest preferred other options . <p> One Beijing worker said his wife prefers their new apartment 's more modern appliances and larger space and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very sociable . But he is unhappy . Once he biked 15 minutes to work ; now he pedals hard to make the journey in 45 minutes  --  a brutal commute in heat , cold or rain . <p> Children do not play outside anymore , he said ; his old courtyard , occupied by about a dozen families , was once an important source of news and gossip , and he now feels cut off . Moreover , if he has had a bad day at work or a quarrel at home , there is no place to go to " blow off steam , " he said . <p> But the relentless force of real estate development is difficult to resist . " I doubt , even if we can come up with a zoning plan , that it can effectively control developers , " said Lu , the Qinghua architect who is helping draw up a new Beijing master plan . During the two years the planning group has been working , many preservation debates have been settled by bulldozers and sledgehammers . <p> Lu said preservationists realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this city of 13 million . Rising incomes are also creating demands for more living space . " You ca n't stop change , " she said . " It has to change , but it 's not like using an eraser , moving everything old and building a new city . . .
