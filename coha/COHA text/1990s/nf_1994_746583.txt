I. INTRODUCTION <p> As clean-up crews feed hazardous waste laden with PCBs and dioxin into an incinerator , the temperature inside the incinerator drops below 2800 C for a moment . As a result , dioxin , one of the four most toxic and carcinogenic chemicals known to humankind , 1 escapes from the smokestack to be dispersed into the surrounding community . An unsuspecting private citizen inhales the dioxin , and ten , twenty , or thirty years later , dies from cancer. 2 <p> Yes , there are laws that govern the emission of dioxin from hazardous waste incinerators , and , unfortunately , it was the government that allowed the dioxin to be emitted from the incinerator as part of a hazardous waste cleanup . Yes , a cleanup . It seems hard to fathom that a cleanup would actually create a worse harm than the one it was intended to remedy , but it can happen. 3 <p> This Comment explores whether private citizens can bring a lawsuit to prevent a cleanup that the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) has approved pursuant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CERCLA ) when the citizens perceive that the cleanup activities might harm their health or the local environment . To protect public health and the environment from hazardous wastes , Congress has provided the EPA with a substantial array of tools which include CERCLA and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ( RCRA ) . 4 Under RCRA , Congress has also conferred on private citizens a right of action to bring lawsuits to abate imminent and substantial endangerments to public health and the environment , and to bring lawsuits to enforce RCRA 's hazardous waste handling performance standards. 5 The language in RCRA and CERCLA that relates to the ability of private citizens to abate imminent and substantial dangers created by an EPA-approved hazardous waste cleanup , however , is ambiguous. 6 Some courts have interpreted this ambiguous language to deny private citizens the right to protect themselves against improperly conducted , but EPA-approved , hazardous waste cleanups. 7 <p> This Comment explores why courts , in light of Congress 's overall hazardous waste management scheme , should read the language in RCRA 's citizen suit provision to allow private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endangerment due to an improperly conducted , but EPA-approved , hazardous waste cleanup .

Congress 's Hazardous Waste Management Scheme : RCRA and CERCLA <p> Together , RCRA and CERCLA make up the bulk of Congress 's hazardous waste management scheme. 11 CERCLA 's provisions address the actual cleanup of released hazardous waste , 12 and RCRA 's provisions prescribe standards to ensure that the present handling of hazardous wastes will not result in the need for future cleanups13 The language , structure , and legislative history of the two acts indicate Congress 's intent that CERCLA clean-up standards and RCRA performance standards work together to provide a hazardous waste management scheme to remedy the nation 's hazardous waste problem. 14 <p> In 1976 , Congress enacted RCRA to address the nation 's hazardous waste problem. 15 Congress intended RCRA to " promote the protection of health and the environment , " 16 by " requiring that hazardous waste be properly managed in the first instance thereby reducing the need for corrective action at a future date . " 17 RCRA requires the EPA to adopt performance standards for the safe handling and disposal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance standards " to protect human health and the environment . " 19 The EPA enforces RCRA 's performance standards in part by requiring all facilities that store , treat and dispose of hazardous waste to obtain and comply with permits issued by the EPA. 20 Because RCRA compels handlers of hazardous wastes to manage their wastes in a way that eliminates risk of future harm to public health and the environment , RCRA is known as Congress 's prospective tool for addressing the nation 's hazardous waste problem. 21 RCRA , however , only applies prospectively to the management of hazardous waste facilities that are in operation. 22 <p> In 1980 , Congress recognized that this prospective only approach left much previously released hazardous waste unaddressed. 23 As a result , Congress enacted CERCLA to address dangers to public health and the environment associated with past releases of hazardous wastes. 24 By enacting CERCLA to cover past releases of hazardous wastes , Congress intended to fill the gaps in the nation 's hazardous waste management scheme left open in RCRA. 25 <p> The EPA enforces CERCLA in a different way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CERCLA 's provisions to alleviate dangers to public health and the environment by authorizing the EPA to pursue cleanups of released hazardous wastes. 27 CERCLA imposes joint and several liability on responsible parties for the costs of cleaning up released hazardous wastes. 28 Section 104 of CERCLA authorizes the EPA to pursue clean-up activities by borrowing money from a central Superfund to cover the costs of the cleanup , and then seeking reimbursement from responsible parties. 29 Under section 104 , the EPA may pursue short-term remedies , known as removal actions , 30 or permanent remedies , known as remedial actions. 31 The EPA also has the authority , under section 106 , to issue an administrative order that requires responsible parties to undertake a private cleanup of released hazardous waste. 32 <p> Although RCRA and CERCLA function differently , the legislative histories of the acts indicate that RCRA and CERCLA are both part of the same legislative scheme. 33 Congress 's primary goal in enacting both RCRA and CERCLA was the same  --  to protect public health and the environment from dangers posed by hazardous wastes. 34 Moreover , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scheme that contained RCRA. 35 In fact , Congress originally enacted CERCLA as an amendment to the Solid Waste Disposal Act ; , which is better known today as RCRA. 36 Thus , CERCLA is effectively an amendment of RCRA. 37 Even though RCRA and CERCLA are printed in different sections of the United States Code , they are ultimately part of the same legislative scheme that Congress enacted to remedy the nation 's hazardous waste problem. 38 <p> Not only do the legislative histories of RCRA and CERCLA indicate that Congress intended RCRA and CERCLA to be part of the same legislative scheme , but the structure of the two acts also indicates that Congress intended RCRA and CERCLA to work together. 39 While CERCLA provides standards that address how clean a hazardous waste site should be , CERCLA does not attempt to identify performance standards applicable to the actual clean-up process. 40 Because CERCLA and RCRA were originally part of the same act , the Solid Waste Disposal Act , it is only logical that one should look for clean-up performance standards in that act . RCRA is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standards that apply to all handling and disposal of hazardous wastes. 41 <p> The plain language of both acts also indicates Congress 's intent that RCRA 's standards should apply to CERCLA cleanups. 42 RCRA 's " Integration with other Acts " provision states that " the Administrator shall integrate all provisions of this chapter ... with such other Acts of Congress as grant regulatory authority to the Administrator . " 43 Similarly , CERCLA 's " General Rules " provision requires the EPA to consider " the goals , objectives , and requirements of RCRA " when the EPA considers alternative remedial actions for response plans. 44 Moreover , while CERCLA specifically exempts clean-up activities from the RCRA permitting process , CERCLA does not exempt cleanup activities from complying with RCRA 's performance standards. 45 Finally , CERCLA 's " savings provision " states that " nothing in this chapter shall affect or modify in any way the obligations or liabilities of any person under other Federal or State law . " 46 <p> CERCLA is Congress 's retrospective tool for securing cleanup of released hazardous waste. 47 RCRA is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not endanger public health or the environment. 48 Thus , together , CERCLA and RCRA make up Congress 's national hazardous waste management scheme . <p> 1 . Citizen Suit Provisions <p> Both RCRA and CERCLA incorporate citizen suit provisions that enable private parties to bring actions to enforce the requirements of each act. 49 Congress included the citizen suit provisions in RCRA and CERCLA to aid the EPA in the goal of ensuring that the nation manages and cleans up hazardous wastes to avoid harm to public health and the environment. 50 Congress , however , has limited the ability of private parties to enforce the requirements of both RCRA and CERCLA by including a jurisdictional bar provision in both acts which , in general , prohibits citizen suits when the EPA 's actions address the hazardous waste problem that the citizen suit seeks to address. 51 <p> a . CERCLA 's Citizen Suit Jurisdictional Bar : Section 113(h) <p> CERCLA 's citizen suit provision allows private parties to bring an action to enforce CERCLA against the government or private parties. 52 Such an action is barred , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hazardous waste release site that the action seeks to address. 53 Congress enacted CERCLA 's jurisdictional bar , section 113(h) , to prevent citizen suits from delaying CERCLA cleanups54 and to avoid the expenditure of Superfund money on copious litigation. 55 There is evidence in CERCLA 's legislative history , however , that indicates Congress did not intend to deny courts the ability to review citizen suits related to " legitimate " health concerns prior to the completion of a CERCLA cleanup. 56 <p> Under CERCLA 's citizen suit provision , private parties may bring an action " against any person ... alleged to be in violation of any standard , regulation , condition , requirement , or order which has become effective pursuant to this chapter . " 57 If the plaintiff 's claim succeeds , the court is authorized to order " such action as may be necessary to correct the violation. " 58 Nevertheless , the same provision which grants the authority for citizen suits also limits citizens ' ability to bring such an action by stating that actions may be brought " except as provided ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Section 113(h) of CERCLA provides that , <p> No Federal court shall have jurisdiction under Federal law other than under section 1332 of Title 28 ( relating to diversity of citizenship jurisdiction ) or under State law which is applicable or relevant and appropriate under section 9621 of this title ( relating to cleanup standards ) to review any challenges to removal or remedial action selected under section 9604 of this title , or to review any order issued under section 9606(a) of this title , in any action except one of the following : <p> ( 4 ) An action under section 9659 of this title ( relating to citizens suits ) alleging that the removal or remedial action taken under section 9604 of this title or secured under section 9606 of this title was in violation of any requirement of this chapter . Such an action may not be brought with regard to a removal where a remedial action is to be undertaken at the site. 60 <p> Thus , in other words , once the EPA has chosen a response action under CERCLA section 104 or CERCLA section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substantive challenge to the response action , except for challenges by private citizens. 61 Because CERCLA section 113(h) ( 4 ) employs the past tense , however , courts have interpreted this section to postpone review of citizen suits until the " challenged " cleanup has been completed. 62 <p> It is important to understand that the Congressional purpose behind CERCLA section 113(h) was to prevent responsible parties from delaying cleanups ; its purpose was not to eliminate all possibility of judicial review for parties with " legitimate " claims63 involving a CERCLA cleanup. 64 The plain language of CERCLA section 113(h) does not take away the right to pursue " legitimate " claims , even though it may postpone such a right. 65 Nor does CERCLA section 113(h) affect the right to pursue a claim under diversity jurisdiction or under state law. 66 The Committee of Conference confirmed that Congress did not intend CERCLA section 113(h) to take away the right to pursue " legitimate " claims. 67 The Committee stated that CERCLA section 113(h) " is not intended to affect in any way the rights of persons to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hazardous wastes . " 68 <p> Section 113(h) ( 4 ) does preserve the right of private citizens to bring a suit challenging an EPA-approved CERCLA cleanup , but section 113(h) ( 4 ) postpones that right until the cleanup is completed. 69 By delaying review of citizen suits that involve CERCLA response actions until completion of such response actions , responsible parties retain the ability to challenge the EPA 's assessment of liability for clean-up costs upon completion of the cleanup , and litigation does not unnecessarily delay cleanups. 70 In addition , by allowing claims under state law , CERCLA section 113(h) 's preservation of the right to pursue state law claims ensures that CERCLA cleanups will comply with any relevant state laws that govern performance standards for hazardous waste handling. 71 <p> The declared purpose behind CERCLA section 113(h) , ensuring that cleanups are not delayed by " dilatory , interim lawsuits " brought by responsible parties in an attempt to slow down or prevent EPA 's clean-up activities , comports with the overall goal of Congress 's hazardous waste management scheme. 72 A prompt response action helps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the environment by reducing exposure to the hazardous wastes. 73 Thus , such an interpretation of CERCLA section 113(h) to postpone review until completion of a CERCLA cleanup would serve to further the primary goal of Congress 's hazardous waste management scheme , protection of public health and the environment. 74 <p> It is possible that in some circumstances the goal of ensuring prompt cleanup would not be compatible with Congress 's goal of protecting public health and the environment. 75 An examination of CERCLA section 113(h) 's legislative history indicates that Congress desired courts to differentiate between suits brought by responsible parties seeking to delay or prevent a CERCLA cleanup , and " legitimate " citizen suits seeking to address concerns related to endangerment of public health and the environment. 76 <p> Citizen suits that allege that a clean-up action itself may be creating a hazard to health or the environment can become moot if courts delay review until the response action is completed. 77 By the time the court heard the claim , the harm from the cleanup would already be done. 78 The possibility that courts might read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a confounding result lead some members of Congress to urge courts to consider the equities of the situation in the court 's decision of whether to delay review of a citizen suit under CERCLA section 113(h) ( 4 ) . 79 These members of Congress desired to avoid an elimination of judicial review for " legitimate " citizen suits that could lead to irreparable harm by postponing review until the harm was done. 80 <p> The legislative history of CERCLA section 113(h) supports a conclusion that while suits brought by responsible parties often seek to avoid liability by preventing the EPA from pursuing a response action , " legitimate " citizen suits usually allege that the chosen response action will create more of a risk to human health or the environment than an alternative response. 81 During legislative debates on CERCLA section 113(h) several members of Congress recognized this potential problem and encouraged courts to make the distinction between suits by responsible parties and " legitimate " citizen suits. 82 Senator Stafford stressed that " legitimate " citizen suits usually allege " that the President or other official have violated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that public health or the environment would be threatened if the proposed action were undertaken . " 83 Similarly , Representative Roe stated that " the legislation intends that the courts will draw appropriate distinctions between dilatory lawsuits by potentially responsible parties involving only monetary damages and legitimate citizen suits representing irreparable injury that can only be addressed during the course of implementing a cleanup. " 84 In addition , Senator Mitchell noted that <p> Citizens are suing to compel compliance with cleanup standards that are designed to protect the public health . Responsible parties , on the other hand , may be suing to halt cleanup because of concerns that the response action is too costly .... Courts should carefully weigh the equities and give great weight to the public health risks involved. 85 <p> Thus , some members of Congress did not want CERCLA section 113(h) to achieve prompt clean-up actions at the expense of protecting public health and the environment . <p> It should be noted that other members of Congress did not believe there should be any distinction between citizen suits by responsible parties and " legitimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the environment. 86 Senator Thurmond expressed a belief that " the timing of review section is intended to be comprehensive .... It covers all issues that could be construed as a challenge to the response , and limits those challenges to the opportunities specifically set forth in the section . " 87 <p> To a limited extent , courts have noted the distinction between responsible party suits and " legitimate " citizen suits. 88 In North Shore Gas Co. v. Environmental Protection Agency , responsible parties challenged part of a CERCLA response plan that required the responsible parties to construct a boat slip as part of a clean-up action. 89 The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit dismissed the case as barred under CERCLA section 113(h) ( 4 ) . 90 In so doing , however , the court evinced its concern that a court could read CERCLA section 113(h) in a way that eliminated all possibility of judicial review for certain citizen suits. 91 The Seventh Circuit expressed concern that such an interpretation of CERCLA section 113(h) could result in irreparable harm by prohibiting review of " legitimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ v. United States Environmental Protection Agency , the District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania dismissed a suit brought by responsible parties challenging the authority of the EPA to order a cleanup at a hazardous waste release site. 93 The court dismissed the case as barred under CERCLA section 113(h) ( 4 ) , but reached its decision by distinguishing between suits by responsible parties and " legitimate " citizen suits. 94 The court stated that citizen suits alleging that a clean-up action " posed a risk of irreparable harm to health or the environment " would be eligible for review sooner than if the suit alleged essentially liability issues. 95 The court reached this distinction based upon CERCLA 's legislative history which called for courts to draw such a distinction in order to serve the purposes behind CERCLA. 96 <p> Congress enacted CERCLA section 113(h) to prevent unnecessary delay of CERCLA cleanups due to citizen litigation. 97 For a court to read CERCLA section 113(h) to postpone review of citizens suits until completion of a CERCLA cleanup serves the overall goal of Congress 's hazardous waste management scheme , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the released hazardous wastes. 98 The same reading can also have the opposite effect , because the delay of " legitimate " citizen suits can lead to irreparable harm to public health and the environment. 99 Some courts have noted remarks from CERCLA section 113(h) 's legislative history and have read section 113(h) in a way that gives greater weight to Congress 's goal of protecting public health and the environment than to its goal of ensuring prompt cleanups. 100 <p> b . RCRA 's Citizens ' Suit and Its Jurisdictional Bar <p> RCRA 's citizen suit provision provides its own version of CERCLA 's jurisdictional bar. 101 This jurisdictional bar changes , however , depending on whether a party brings a suit under RCRA 's enforcement provision , section ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) , 102 or under RCRA 's imminent and substantial endangerment provision , section ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) . 103 Section ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) of RCRA allows a private party to bring a suit to compel compliance with the requirements of RCRA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own enforcement action. 104 Section ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) of RCRA allows private parties to bring actions to restrain or abate acts which the parties allege are creating " an imminent and substantial endangerment to health or the environment , " unless the EPA is already seeking to restrain or abate the alleged endangerment. 105 <p> The language and structure of RCRA 's citizen suit provision indicate that Congress intended that parties could bring RCRA ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) actions to enforce the requirements of RCRA 's provisions at a CERCLA cleanup. 106 RCRA 's jurisdictional bar , for both RCRA ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) and RCRA ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) actions , is contained in RCRA section 6972(b). 107 The language of RCRA section 6972(b) prohibits a citizen suit under RCRA ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) if the government is already pursuing an action to enforce the same requirements that the citizen suit seeks to address. 108 The language in section 6972(b) that establishes the jurisdictional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B ) actions , however , prohibits such actions if the EPA is pursuing an action to address the activities109 which are creating the alleged endangerment , including a response under CERCLA. 110 In other words , section 6972(b) bars a citizen suit under RCRA ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) in the face of an ongoing , EPA-approved cleanup , 111 but there is no corresponding bar for suits brought under RCRA ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) during an EPA-approved cleanup. 112 The prohibition of citizen suits under RCRA ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) where a CERCLA response is ongoing , and lack of corresponding prohibition for citizen suits under RCRA ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) , indicates Congress 's intent that a CERCLA response would not bar an enforcement action under RCRA 's ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) provision. 113 Thus , parties may bring a citizen suit under RCRA ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) to compel compliance with the requirements of RCRA , even in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of RCRA comports with views expressed in CERCLA 's legislative history that RCRA and CERCLA would work together in remedying the nation 's hazardous waste problem. 114 When Congress composed RCRA 's citizen suit provision to allow enforcement of RCRA 's performance standards at a CERCLA clean-up site , Congress gave further effect to RCRA 's objective " that hazardous waste be properly managed in the first instance thereby reducing the need for corrective action at a future date . " 115 Congress 's application of RCRA 's requirements to CERCLA cleanups ensures that parties conduct cleanups in a " safe " manner that eliminates the need to address future damage to public health and the environment which could result from an improperly conducted cleanup. 116 The ability to maintain an action under RCRA ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) comports with the relationship between RCRA and CERCLA in Congress 's hazardous waste management scheme. 117 Moreover , the ability to maintain a RCRA ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) action comports with the fact that CERCLA does not exempt itself from RCRA 's performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RCRA 's ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) provision , to abate an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health or the environment , RCRA section ( b ) ( 2 ) ( B ) prohibits the lawsuit if the EPA is already pursuing an action to abate the acts which are allegedly creating or contributing to the endangerment to health or environment. 119 The language of RCRA ( b ) ( 2 ) ( B ) provides that an action under RCRA ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) is prohibited if the EPA is acting " in order to restrain or abate acts or conditions which may have contributed or are contributing to the activities which may present the alleged endangerment. " 120 Arguably , one can read RCRA ( b ) ( 2 ) ( B ) to restrict the jurisdictional bar on RCRA ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) suits only to situations where the EPA is addressing the exact same activities which the parties allege to be creating the endangerment to public health or the environment . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an action to clean up a release of hazardous waste that parties allege to be an endangerment , a party may not bring a citizen suit that challenges the cleanup of those wastes until completion of the cleanup. 122 On the other hand , where the alleged endangerment is not the released hazardous waste that is subject to the cleanup , but is instead the emissions from clean-up activities , one may read the language of RCRA ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) and RCRA ( b ) ( 2 ) ( B ) to indicate that a citizen suit is not barred unless the EPA is involved in an action that addresses the allegedly dangerous emissions. 123 <p> It is possible that the clean-up activities themselves may create an endangerment distinct from the endangerment of the hazardous wastes that are being cleaned up. 124 In such a situation , a party might maintain an action under RCRA ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) if the EPA was not taking corrective action relating to the pollution emitted by the clean-up activities. 125 For a court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 ) ( B ) would further the purpose of RCRA to provide for the safe disposal of hazardous wastes in the first place so as to eliminate the need for future remedial action ? Moreover , for a court to allow such an imminent and substantial endangerment action would further the primary goal of Congress 's hazardous waste management scheme , protecting public health and the environment ? On the other hand , it is possible that Congress intended RCRA ( b ) ( 2 ) ( B ) to bar all RCRA ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) actions in order to prevent litigation from delaying clean-up actions128 The intent to bar all RCRA ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) actions does not necessarily conflict with the primary purpose of Congress 's hazardous waste management scheme , because prompt cleanup of hazardous wastes often helps prevent harm to public health and the environment by minimizing exposure to the wastes.129 Given this view of Congressional intent , one could read RCRA ( b ) ( 2 ) ( B ) ' s provisions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) imminent and substantial endangerment suits that relate to ongoing CERCLA response actions. 130 <p> Moreover , the plain language of RCRA ( b ) ( 2 ) ( B ) distinguishes between CERCLA response actions conducted by the EPA itself under CERCLA section 104 , and those response actions conducted by a responsible party pursuant to an administrative order under CERCLA section 106. 131 Where a cleanup is conducted pursuant to an administrative order under CERCLA section 106 , RCRA ( b ) ( 2 ) ( B ) prohibits RCRA ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) actions " only as to the scope and duration of the administrative order referred to . " 132 The case of Fishel v. Westinghouse Elec . Corp. , addressed this issue. 133 In Fishel , the plaintiffs alleged that release of hazardous wastes was adversely affecting their drinking water. 134 The defendant argued that RCRA ( b ) ( 2 ) ( B ) barred plaintiffs ' claim because there was already an ongoing CERCLA cleanup at the site in question. 135 The District Court for the Middle District of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 2 ) ( B ) did not bar plaintiffs ' suit , because the scope of the administrative order , which related to the ongoing CERCLA cleanup , addressed only surface contamination. 136 Because the subject matter of the plaintiff 's suit was subsurface contamination , the court found that the plain language of RCRA ( b ) ( 2 ) ( B ) did not bar the plaintiffs ' suit. 137 <p> The Fishel case stands for the proposition that parties may maintain an action under RCRA ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) in the face of a cleanup under CERCLA section 106. 138 This is so even if one finds that RCRA ( b ) ( 2 ) ( B ) bars RCRA ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) actions that conflict with an ongoing cleanup under CERCLA section 104. 139 One may reasonably conclude that EPA-conducted cleanups would bar a RCRA citizen suit while cleanups conducted by responsible parties would not , because Congress and courts often defer to the EPA 's " environmental expertise " in order to guard against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more likely that cleanups conducted by the EPA , as opposed to cleanups conducted by private parties , would be given the benefit of the doubt that they were protecting public health and the environment . <p> Even though Congress distinguishes between section 104 and section 106 response actions , one may conclude that RCRA ( b ) ( 2 ) ( B ) also bars suits that allege that CERCLA section 106 clean-up activities themselves are creating an imminent and substantial endangerment to health or the environment. 141 This is because any clean-up activities , even if they create their own pollution , are arguably within the scope of an administrative order relating to the cleanup of a hazardous waste site. 142 In North Shore Gas , the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held that any measure involved in a clean-up action " reasonably related to " the cleanup is part of the remedial action , and , thus , is within the scope of the relevant administrative order143 Thus , courts can reasonably find that pollution that results from clean-up activities is within the scope of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the clean-up plan. 144 <p> It is true that litigation delays might be avoided if courts interpret RCRA ( b ) ( 2 ) ( B ) to bar citizens suits in the face of an ongoing CERCLA cleanup , but barring such suits might allow clean-up activities that harm public health and the environment to go unchecked. 145 Such an interpretation of RCRA ( b ) ( 2 ) ( B ) ' s provisions could have consequences that run counter to the expressed purpose behind Congress 's hazardous waste management scheme , protection of public health and the environment. 146 <p> 2 . RCRA 's Citizen Suit meets CERCLA 's Jurisdictional Bar <p> Some EPA-approved CERCLA cleanups may be well-intentioned , but , nevertheless , may fail to meet RCRA 's standards for hazardous waste disposal , or may actually create residual harms. 147 Citizens who live near a clean-up action that fails to meet RCRA 's standards , or allegedly endangers health or the environment , may turn to courts to ensure that the cleanup does not harm their health or the local environment. 148 RCRA 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their concerns to the attention of a court. 149 <p> It is conceivable that suits brought under RCRA 's citizen suit provisions , which seek to enforce RCRA 's requirements or abate an imminent and substantial endangerment at a CERCLA clean-up site , would run up against CERCLA 's jurisdictional bar. 150 Section 113(h) of CERCLA bars any " challenges " to a CERCLA response action ; though section 113(h) ( 4 ) excepts citizen suits from this bar , it postpones the right to bring citizen suits until completion of a response action. 151 Plaintiffs have tried to bring citizen suits alleging violations of statutes besides RCRA and CERCLA , and all have been unable to overcome CERCLA 's jurisdictional bar of section 113(h). 152 Nevertheless , there are compelling reasons to reach a different conclusion about the ability to overcome CERCLA section 113(h) 's jurisdictional bar in an action brought under RCRA 's citizen suit provision. 153 <p> There is reason to believe that citizen suits brought under RCRA will have more success against CERCLA 's jurisdictional bar than suits brought under other statutory provisions . The citizen suits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which have failed as a result , were brought under provisions that did not specifically address the issue of when such suits could be maintained in the face of a CERCLA response. 154 In Boarhead Corp . v. Erickson , the plaintiff brought an action to remove a piece of property from the National Priorities List155 on the grounds that the property was eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places. 156 The plaintiff argued that the National Historic Preservation Act ( NHPA ) authorized the court to review the case and grant relief as appropriate despite CERCLA clean-up activities at the site. 157 In reviewing the case , the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit noted that even though it could hear the plaintiff 's claim under the NHPA , section 113(h) of CERCLA barred federal courts from exercising jurisdiction over the plaintiff 's claim. 158 It is important to note that the NHPA differs from RCRA in that the NHPA does not address the issue of whether and when a party may maintain a citizen suit in the face of a CERCLA cleanup. 159 <p> Similarly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit that sought to compel the EPA to prepare an environmental impact statement , pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act ( NEPA ) , in conjunction with actions taken at a CERCLA site. 160 The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit first found that it could review NEPA claims under the Administrative Procedure Act ( APA ) . 161 Then , however , the court dismissed the case as barred by the plain language of CERCLA section 113(h) , because the plaintiffs ' action constituted a " challenge " to a CERCLA response. 162 <p> As with Boarhead Corp. , it is important to note that neither NEPA nor the APA address the issue of whether and when a party may maintain an action in the face of a CERCLA response. 163 RCRA 's citizen suit provision , on the other hand , does specifically address the issue of whether and when actions are barred in the face of a CERCLA response. 164 Because RCRA 's citizen suit provision does address this issue , it is an indication that Congress did not intend CERCLA section 113(h) to bar a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bring suits in the face of CERCLA cleanups. 165 TO hold that CERCLA section 113(h) bars RCRA citizen suits would be to find that Congress meant to implicitly repeal a right of action conferred by RCRA . As a general rule , courts are reluctant to do this. 166 <p> Another characteristic that distinguishes cases that courts found to be barred by CERCLA section 113(h) from cases involving RCRA citizen suits is that parties did not bring the former suits under provisions which related directly to protection of public health and the environment from hazardous waste. 167 This is an important distinction , because protection of public health and the environment from hazardous wastes is central to both RCRA and CERCLA. 168 The statute at issue in Boarhead Corp . was the NHPA , which addresses preservation of historic landmarks rather than protection of health. 169 Similarly , while the statute involved in Schalk , NEPA , deals broadly with environmental protection , it does not deal directly with protection of public health and the environment from hazardous wastes , and it is not part of Congress 's hazardous waste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corp . and Schalk , RCRA 's performance standards are specifically designed to protect public health and the environment from hazardous wastes. 171 An action brought under RCRA 's citizen suit provision , which seeks either to enforce RCRA 's requirements or to abate an imminent and substantial endangerment , necessarily furthers protection of public health and the environment. 172 This is the primary goal of CERCLA. 173 In addition , Congress passed CERCLA as an amendment to RCRA in order to supplement RCRA 's " prospective " hazardous waste management scheme. 174 Thus , there is a generic , statutory difference between citizen suits brought under RCRA and those brought under other statutes. 175 It is important to understand this difference in order to resolve discrepancies over Congressional intent in the interpretation of CERCLA section 113(h) 's jurisdictional bar so that it does not defeat the primary goal of CERCLA and Congress 's hazardous waste management scheme , protection of public health and the environment . B. The Case Law : A Split in the Circuits <p> The combined language of CERCLA and RCRA does not explicitly address whether CERCLA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ( 1 ) ( A ) and ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) when the RCRA citizen suits involve an EPA-approved CERCLA cleanup. 176 Nevertheless , the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit177 and the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit have addressed this issue. 178 These two courts have split on the issue of whether CERCLA section 113(h) bars judicial review of citizen suits brought under RCRA. 179 <p> 1 . United States v. Colorado : No Jurisdictional Bar <p> In United States v. Colorado , the State of Colorado sought to enforce its RCRA-authorized hazardous waste management laws against the United States Army in the Army 's cleanup of the Rocky Mountain Arsenal. 180 The Army was conducting a cleanup to remedy the many tons of hazardous wastes that it had disposed of at the arsenal. 181 The EPA was overseeing the Army 's clean-up activities to ensure compliance with federal hazardous waste laws. 182 Colorado brought its action to enforce RCRA-approved state hazardous waste laws pursuant to RCRA 's ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) citizen suit provision which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requirements. 183 The Army argued that CERCLA section 113(h) barred judicial review of any challenges to a CERCLA response action prior to completion of the response action. 184 The Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit , however , decided that CERCLA section 113(h) did not bar Colorado 's RCRA ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) enforcement action , and the court allowed Colorado to enforce its compliance order. 185 <p> The Tenth Circuit examined the problem as one of statutory construction. 186 In deciding the case , the Tenth Circuit relied on a close scrutiny of the plain language and structure of CERCLA and RCRA in light of Congress 's intention to create a hazardous waste management scheme to remedy the nation 's hazardous waste problem. 187 The court concluded that Congress did not implicitly repeal RCRA 's citizen suit provision by the inclusion of section 113(h) in CERCLA 's 1986 Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act amendments. 188 The court proceeded to interpret both CERCLA section 113(h) and RCRA ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) in light of Congress 's overall hazardous waste management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not intend CERCLA to change the effect of any other federal or state law , and thus compliance with CERCLA should not alleviate the Army 's need to comply with the requirements of RCRA which Colorado sought to enforce. 190 The court went on to note that , for purposes of CERCLA section 113(h) , Congress contemplated a differentiation between suits by potentially responsible parties which sought to delay a CERCLA response , and " legitimate " citizen suits which sought to further the protection of public health and the environment. 191 As Colorado 's enforcement action was not a challenge by a responsible party , the court found that Colorado 's action was not one which Congress intended to bar from review prior to completion of a CERCLA response. 192 <p> The Tenth Circuit ultimately decided that Colorado 's effort to apply its hazardous waste management laws to the Army 's CERCLA cleanup was not a " challenge " to a CERCLA response within the meaning of section 113(h). 193 The court reached this decision because it found that Congress , in enacting CERCLA section 113(h) , intended to prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or prevented CERCLA cleanups. 194 As Colorado 's lawsuit merely sought to ensure that the cleanup complied with EPA-authorized state laws , and did not seek to delay or prevent the cleanup , the court concluded that Colorado 's action did not fall within the meaning of " challenge " that Congress had contemplated in enacting CERCLA section 113(h). 195 <p> The Tenth Circuit also relied on the language of RCRA 's citizen suit provision to support its conclusion that Congress did not intend for CERCLA section 113(h) to bar RCRA ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) actions in the face of a CERCLA response. 196 The court noted the difference between RCRA ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) and RCRA ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) actions in the " Actions Prohibited " section of RCRA 's citizens ' suit provision. 197 The court decided that RCRA section 6972(b) 's prohibition of RCRA ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) actions prior to the completion of a CERCLA response , and the lack of a corresponding prohibition for RCRA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , evidenced Congress 's intent not to prohibit RCRA ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) actions during a CERCLA response. 198 <p> The theme that runs throughout the Tenth Circuit 's decision is the practical notion that it makes little sense , in light of Congress 's overall hazardous waste management scheme , to allow a CERCLA response to proceed in disregard of RCRA 's requirements. 199 Because Congress intended RCRA and CERCLA to work together to remedy the nation 's hazardous waste problems , 200 the court concluded that it should not implicitly repeal the right of action conferred by RCRA which allowed a citizen suit action to enforce RCRA 's requirements at a CERCLA cleanup. 201 <p> 2 . Arkansas Peace Ctr. v. Arkansas Dep't of Pollution Control and Ecology : Jurisdictional Bar <p> The other case that addresses the question of whether CERCLA section 113(h) bars an action under RCRA ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) is Arkansas Peace Ctr. v. Arkansas Dep't of Pollution Control and Ecology. 202 In Arkansas Peace Ctr. , neighbors of a CERCLA response site brought an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at an abandoned herbicide and pesticide production site. 203 The hazardous waste to be incinerated contained dioxin , which is one of the most toxic and carcinogenic compounds known to humans. 204 <p> The plaintiffs sued under both RCRA ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) , seeking to enforce RCRA 's performance standards to the cleanup , and RCRA ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) , seeking to abate the alleged imminent and substantial endangerment to public health and the environment posed by the release of dioxin into the air via the incinerator. 205 The suit under RCRA ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) sought to enforce compliance with a RCRA promulgated regulation that required incinerators to operate at a " destruction and removal efficiency " of 99.9999% for dioxin. 206 The district court below had found that the defendants could not demonstrate that the incinerator to be used at the site was capable of achieving the RCRA-required destruction and removal efficiency , and the court had issued a preliminary injunction. 207 The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of subject matter jurisdiction. 208 The court found that CERCLA section 113(h) barred the plaintiff 's suit under RCRA ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) , because the suit was a " challenge " under CERCLA section 113(h). 209 <p> In reaching its decision , the Eighth Circuit relied mainly on comparisons of Arkansas Peace Ctr. with cases which addressed the question of whether CERCLA section 113(h) barred judicial review prior to completion of a CERCLA response. 210 The Eighth Circuit compared the case to Schalk v. Reilly. 211 Schalk involved a suit brought under NEPA that sought to compel the EPA to prepare an environmental impact statement ( EIS ) regarding the clean-up method it had selected. 212 The Eighth Circuit also compared Arkansas Peace Ctr. to Boarhead Corp . v. Erickson. 213 Boarhead Corp . was brought under the NHPA. 214 The Eighth Circuit cited Schalk and Boarhead Corp . for the proposition that Congress intended CERCLA section 113(h) to bar any action that delayed a CERCLA cleanup. 215 The Eighth Circuit also relied on North Shore Gas Co. v. Environmental Protection Agency to support its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completion of a CERCLA cleanup. 216 North Shore Gas appeared to be very similar to Arkansas Peace Ctr. in that it had been brought in part under RCRA. 217 North Shore Gas was not entirely similar , however , because it involved a suit brought by potentially responsible parties that dealt with issues of liability allocation. 218 In CERCLA section 113(h) 's legislative history , Congress urged courts to differentiate between such a suit by potentially responsible parties and " legitimate " citizen suits. 219 <p> The plaintiffs in Arkansas Peace Ctr. also tried to bring a suit under RCRA ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) . 220 This part of the suit alleged that the emission of any dioxin from the incinerator into the environment was an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health and the environment. 221 As dioxin is one of the most potent toxins and carcinogens known , even a minuscule amount released into the atmosphere can be lethal. 222 Nevertheless , the Eighth Circuit found the language of RCRA 's " Actions Prohibited " section , section 6972(b) , expressly barred this cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BEDFORD HARBOR AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW RCRA CITIZEN SUITS HELP TO FURTHER THE GOALS OF CONGRESS 'S HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT SCHEME <p> The CERCLA cleanup of New Bedford Harbor provides a vivid example of how the interpretation of CERCLA section 113(h) to allow " legitimate " citizen suits under RCRA can ultimately further CERCLA 's goal of protecting public health and the environment from hazardous wastes . New Bedford Harbor , in New Bedford , Massachusetts , has been one of the most polluted harbors in the world since the 1970s. 224 The sediments in the harbor are laden with PCBs and heavy metals. 225 It was not until 1982 , however , that the EPA declared the harbor a Superfund site , and the CERCLA clean-up process began. 226 In 1986 , the EPA reached a " cash out " settlement agreement with the two primary responsible parties , Aerovox and Cornell-Dubilier. 227 This settlement agreement allowed the EPA to pursue a cleanup itself , under CERCLA section 104. 228 In 1980 , eight years after the EPA declared the harbor a Superfund site , the EPA put forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the best technology to clean up the harbor. 229 <p> CERCLA requires that the EPA consult with a community working group when choosing a response alternative. 230 The EPA worked with such a group in New Bedford. 231 Nevertheless , when the community learned that the EPA had chosen incineration for the cleanup , some members of the community became concerned because of reports that incineration of PCBs can result in the release of dioxin. 232 When the EPA released the ROD , and made known the location of the incineration site , neighbors of the site formed a coalition , called " Hands Across the River . " 233 The coalition intended to block the use of incineration to clean up the harbor. 234 By 1993 , other citizen groups from communities located downwind of the incineration site had joined Hands Across the River. 235 <p> According to scientific evidence gathered during the late 1980s and early 1990s the fears of these citizen groups were valid. 236 The scientific evidence suggested that incineration was not the best alternative for cleaning up hazardous wastes. 237 In fact , the evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incineration could actually be more hazardous to human health than the alternative of leaving the hazardous wastes in place. 238 This information greatly concerned the citizens who lived near the New Bedford Harbor incineration site , because they knew that dioxin would be released when the harbor sediments , containing PCBs , were incinerated. 239 <p> Hands Across the River retained the legal services of Alternatives for Community and Environment ( " ACE " ) in the fall of 1993. 240 ACE , working in conjunction with members of the Conservation Research Group at Boston College Law School , filed a notice of intent to sue with the EPA. 241 In addition to other claims , the notice included a claim under RCRA ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) alleging that the incineration of PCBs and emission of dioxin would create an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health and the environment near and downwind of the incineration site. 242 As a result of this notice , ACE was successful in persuading the EPA to enter into mediation with Hands Across the River and , subsequently , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the harbor. 243 As soon as the EPA withdrew incineration as a cleanup alternative , Hands Across the River became a partner with the EPA in exploring constructive alternatives for cleaning up New Bedford Harbor. 244 <p> Ultimately , Hands Across the River was successful in convincing the EPA that incineration does not protect public health and the environment and , therefore , does not further the purpose behind CERCLA. 245 Even though the legal action by the citizen group had the effect of delaying the cleanup , the action was not brought by a responsible party and was not intended to delay or prevent the cleanup , which was precisely what Congress sought to avoid by enacting CERCLA section 113(h). 246 As a result of the citizen group 's ability to threaten a lawsuit , the ultimate remediation of the New Bedford Harbor will result in a cleanup that truly protects public health and the environment. 247 <p> This case study illustrates why courts should not read CERCLA section 113(h) to bar a citizen suit action under RCRA 's citizen suit provisions . This case is a good example of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the environment would be furthered if citizen groups had RCRA 's citizen suit provision in their arsenal to combat CERCLA cleanups that could create a harm worse than the one being remedied. 249 If the EPA knows that a RCRA citizen suit will not be barred by CERCLA section 113(h) , the Agency may be quick to enter into negotiations and work with communities to remedy hazardous waste problems rather than fight in court over a CERCLA response such as incineration that might not adequately protect public health and the environment . The New Bedford experience demonstrates that by reading CERCLA section 113(h) to allow citizen suits under RCRA it is possible to harmonize Congress 's goal for its hazardous waste management scheme , protection of public health and the environment , with its goal for CERCLA section 113(h) , preventing responsible parties from delaying or preventing cleanups. 250 IV . WHY COURTS SHOULD NOT INTERPRET CERCLA 's JURISDICTIONAL BAR TO PROHIBIT RCRA CITIZENS ' SUITS <p> RCRA , on its face , may be read to reach the conclusion that parties may bring RCRA citizen suit actions prior to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is some evidence that Congress intended courts to read CERCLA section 113(h) to allow for review of " legitimate " citizen suits prior to completion of a CERCLA cleanup. 252 Reading RCRA and CERCLA in this way furthers Congress 's overall goal of its hazardous waste management scheme , protection of public health and the environment. 253 In addition , cases where courts have read CERCLA section 113(h) to bar citizen suits relating to a CERCLA cleanup are distinguishable from situations where citizen suits are brought under RCRA. 254 <p> Where an action is brought under one of RCRA 's citizen suit provisions , RCRA 's provisions for prohibition of review must be reconciled with CERCLA 's section 113(h). 255 RCRA 's " Actions Prohibited " provision plainly , and expressly , contemplates the issue of whether and when a party may maintain a citizen suit in the face of a CERCLA response. 256 While the " Actions Prohibited " provision expressly bars RCRA ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) actions in the face of a CERCLA response , there is no corresponding prohibition for RCRA ( a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language indicates Congress 's intent that a party may maintain an enforcement action under RCRA ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) even if the EPA is engaged in a CERCLA response. 258 In addition , it is possible to read the language of RCRA 's " Actions Prohibited " provision to allow a party to maintain a RCRA ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) action in the face of a CERCLA response if the EPA is not addressing the exact same activities that are alleged to be creating the imminent and substantial endangerment. 259 <p> The question remains , however , whether Congress intended an action under RCRA 's citizen suit provision to be a " challenge " under CERCLA section 113(h) , so as to implicitly repeal the right to bring a citizen suit under RCRA in the face of a CERCLA response . It is doubtful that Congress so intended . Reading CERCLA section 113(h) to bar RCRA citizen suits that allege that a CERCLA cleanup is harming health or the environment would not serve the purposes behind Congress 's hazardous waste management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar for many claims that involve a CERCLA cleanup , it is doubtful that CERCLA section 113(h) should be interpreted in a way that creates irreparable harm. 261 Indeed , taken to its extreme , such a reading of CERCLA section 113(h) could lead to the prohibition of judicial review even if EPA 's remedial plan included " taking the barrels of dioxin , trucking them down to the Arkansas River and dumping them in the river . " 262 <p> In enacting CERCLA section 113(h) , Congress did not intend to eliminate judicial review altogether , but merely intended to postpone review of " legitimate " claims until a cleanup is completed. 263 By postponing review of a suit alleging irreparable harm until it is moot , courts would eliminate any meaningful judicial review and would potentially allow irreparable harm to public health and the environment . Such a result is antithetical to Congress 's goals. 264 Congress designed CERCLA section 113(h) to secure prompt cleanup and thus limit exposure to hazardous wastes , to further the main goal of CERCLA. 265 Indeed , prompt cleanup is often compatible with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances where a " legitimate " citizen suit can be brought under RCRA , however , delaying review for the purpose of securing prompt cleanup would be incompatible with protection of public health and the environment. 267 Some members of Congress explicitly recognized this possibility and called for courts to balance the equities of the situation and to interpret CERCLA section 113(h) to distinguish between suits brought by responsible parties and " legitimate " citizen suits. 268 Distinguishing between suits brought by responsible parties and " legitimate " citizen suits would serve CERCLA section 113(h) 's purpose of preventing responsible parties from delaying cleanups with " dilatory " litigation . To so distinguish would also be consistent with the goal of protecting public health and the environment. 269 It would be sadly ironic if courts were to read CERCLA section 113(h) in a way that defeated CERCLA 's goal of protecting public health and the environment270 and RCRA 's goal of minimizing the necessity of future cleanups. 271 <p> The policy argument for reading CERCLA section 113(h) to further the goal of protecting public health and the environment is applicable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( A ) and RCRA ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) . Suits under RCRA ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) explicitly address protection of public health and the environment ; 272 suits under RCRA ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) implicitly address health and environmental protection issues , as the requirements that they seek to enforce are designed to protect public health and the environment. 273 <p> Understanding that RCRA and CERCLA make up Congress 's hazardous waste management scheme also offers a compelling reason not to read CERCLA section 113(h) as a bar to citizen suits under RCRA in the face of an ongoing CERCLA response. 274 Congress originally enacted CERCLA to supplement RCRA in remedying the nation 's hazardous waste problem , and Congress indicated that it intended CERCLA to work with other hazardous waste laws in addressing this problem. 275 Thus , a suit under RCRA is not necessarily a " challenge " to a CERCLA response , because a full consideration of RCRA 's provisions is necessary as part of a CERCLA response. 276 <p> Even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 ) ( B ) suits seeking to abate an imminent and substantial endangerment at a CERCLA cleanup site are not " challenges " to a CERCLA response , it is doubtful that the same can be argued for RCRA ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) suits that seek to enforce the requirements of RCRA. 277 In understanding why RCRA ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) suits are not " challenges " to a CERCLA response , first consider that Congress originally enacted CERCLA to supplement RCRA. 278 Next , recall CERCLA section 121(e) , which states that CERCLA shall work with other federal hazardous waste laws to remedy the nation 's hazardous waste problem. 279 It is difficult to argue that an action that seeks to compel a CERCLA response to comply with the law , which is in fact part of the same legislative scheme as CERCLA , is a " challenge " to a CERCLA response. 280 It is true that such a lawsuit could have the same delaying effect that Congress sought to avoid by enacting CERCLA section 113(h). 281 Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was to prevent lawsuits that responsible parties brought with the intent to delay or prevent a CERCLA cleanup. 282 Congress did not intend to prevent " legitimate " lawsuits that parties brought to ensure that a CERCLA cleanup was complying with the law. 283 <p> Cases that have held claims under other statutes to be barred on the grounds that they were " challenges " to a CERCLA response are distinguishable from situations that involve citizen suits under RCRA. 284 Both Boarhead Corp . and Schalk were brought under statutes which were not part of Congress 's hazardous waste management scheme. 285 Boarhead Corp . was brought under the NHPA , 286 and Schalk was brought under the APA. 287 In addition , neither the NHPA nor the APA has a citizen suit provision that specifically addresses when an action may be maintained in the face of a CERCLA cleanup. 288 RCRA does specifically address this issue. 289 Therefore , Boarhead Corp . and Schalk do not offer compelling reasons for reading the word " challenge " in CERCLA section 113(h) to bar a citizen suit under RCRA in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In light of the fact that RCRA and CERCLA are both part of Congress 's hazardous waste management scheme , and were both intended to protect public health and the environment , it defies good policy to read CERCLA section 113(h) in a way that bars actions under RCRA that seek to ensure that CERCLA cleanups are conducted properly . Courts should fully examine the language , structure , and legislative history of Congress 's hazardous waste management scheme , and then should read CERCLA section 113(h) in a way that avoids irreparable harm to public health and the environment . Reading CERCLA section 113(h) to allow RCRA citizen suits will ultimately have the effect of ensuring that we reach the best possible solutions to the nation 's hazardous waste problem , and will ultimately help the EPA in its efforts to work with communities to clean up pollution in their environment . <p> * Editor in Chief , BOSTON COLLEGE ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS LAW REVIEW 1994-1995 .

Healy , Judicial Review and CERCLA Response Actions : Interpretive Strategies in the Face of Plain Meaning , 17 HARV . ENVTL . L. REV. 1 , 48 n.234 ( 1993 ) . The public participation requirement also ensures that the EPA considers all alternative response plans in the hope that the chosen response plan will not harm human health and the environment . See id . The consideration of alternatives includes the alternative of leaving the hazardous wastes in place and doing nothing . See CERCLA , 9621(a) ( c ) . There are arguably cases in which the " do nothing " alternative may be safer than removing the hazardous wastes . See , e.g. , Village of Wilsonville v. SCA Servs .
