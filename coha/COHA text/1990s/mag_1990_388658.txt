Section : The Budget <p> We face higher taxes and no spending cuts , but at least we got budget-process reform , right ? Right : reform that makes it easier for Congress to undo the Reagan Revolution . <p> IT WAS only fitting that George Bush waited until election eve to sign into law the largest tax increase in American history . By reneging on his solemn no-new-taxes pledge , Bush had discarded his party 's best political issue and paved the way for the loss of seats in both the Senate and the House . Democratic strategists are still amazed that the White House capitulated so easily and completely . Indeed , through much of the summer , many Democrats were convinced the budget summit was a trap designed to lure them into openly advocating tax increases . <p> After all , who would have predicted one year ago that George " Read My Lips " Bush would agree to a five-year budget deal that raised taxes by at least $170 billion , allowed spending to increase by at least $245 billion , and emasculated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voters . If they had been shown this package in October of 1988 and told it would become law in 1990 , they would have assumed Michael Dukakis must have won the election in the meantime . <p> To make a bad situation even worse , the President did not get anything in exchange for breaking his pledge . When he called for " tax revenue increases " in June , he also insisted that a budget agreement include cuts in entitlement spending , a lower capital-gains tax , and reforms in the budget process . While Congress was delighted to raise taxes , the other " non-negotiable " requirements somehow never made it into the final package . <p> Richard Darman , director of the Office of Management and Budget ( OMB ) , continues to claim that the new " deficit reduction " package is a good one . Much as Ronald Reagan 's advisors during the 1982 TEFRA debacle insisted the President got three dollars of spending cuts for every dollar of taxes , Bush 's lieutenants apparently believe that repeating something often enough makes it true . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spending by $120 billion . In fact , entitlement spending is projected to grow by more than $200 billion over the next five years . Only under the Washington definition of a cut  --  increasing spending at a slower rate than previously planned  --  are there any savings . <p> Even under this slippery definition of a budget cut , Darman 's entitlement savings are largely phony . He counts the transfer of $5.6 billion of revenue from the Postal Service to the general budget as an entitlement cut . Increasing taxes on banks is also counted as an entitlement cut , as is the provision shifting the time when certain retirement benefits are paid to federal employees . Delaying some student-loan payments is considered an entitlement cut , while agricultural savings have been made contingent on the increasingly unlikely completion of international trade negotiations . Keeping the taxpayer subsidy for the Part B portion of Medicare at 75 per cent is considered an entitlement cut . Provisions changing direct-loan programs into guaranteed-loan programs are counted as entitlement savings , demonstrating that politicians have failed to learn from the S &L; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Bad News <p> DARMAN claims the Administration got budget-process reform in exchange for higher taxes , and in some senses he is right . The bad news is that the changes will make it even easier for Congress to spend other people 's money . <p> Along with the two other stooges negotiating on behalf of the Administration , Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and Chief of Staff John Sununu , Darman did absolutely nothing to press for a tax-limitation or balanced-budget amendment in the agreement . Nor was there any serious discussion of the line-item veto or of requiring a super-majority vote to raise taxes . Instead , the White House negotiators effectively agreed to do away with Gramm  --  Rudman , the only part of the budget process that has helped control federal spending over the last five years . <p> For all its imperfections , Gramm  --  Rudman did limit how fast spending could grow . Federal spending in any given year could be no higher than the sum of projected tax revenues plus the maximum allowable deficit . While Congress always used loopholes and gimmicks to increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rudman clearly slowed the growth rate of federal spending , which is one reason why leading Democrats such as Senate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser ( D. , Tenn. ) and House Ways &; Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski ( D. , Ill. ) had come out for repealing the law . An Empty Shell <p> LITTLE did they realize that the Bush Administration would be so accommodating . While Gramm  --  Rudman technically still exists , it is an empty shell . Its heart and soul  --  fixed deficit targets  --  have been replaced by deficit targets that are automatically adjusted upward whenever economic and technical assumptions are discovered to have been too optimistic . Supporters of the budget summit neglected to point out , naturally , that almost all unforeseen increases in government spending are attributable to changes in economic and technical assumptions . The goal of a balanced budget , which had been enshrined in the Gramm  --  Rudman law , is now replaced by a process analogous to a donkey chasing a carrot tied to the end of a stick . <p> The President and others have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and foreign-aid spending as a great breakthrough and a victory for fiscal responsibility . Once again , however , White House officials have mysteriously forgotten to mention that these spending " caps " are also automatically increased every time it is discovered that the Administration 's economic and technical assumptions are wrong . Since the spending caps allow domestic spending to grow by more than 6 per cent yearly under current assumptions , skeptics may be excused for not viewing the creation of these caps as a great victory . <p> With regard to capital gains , the President failed to achieve a tax cut . Typically , the White House considers it a victory that the maximum effective tax rate on capital-gains income stayed at 28 per cent instead of rising to 31 per cent along with the maximum effective tax rate on regular income . It is worth noting that President Bush began the summit process insisting on a reduction in the capital-gains rate and no increase in the personal-income-tax rate and wound up losing on both fronts . <p> It is difficult to understand why the White House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his cronies , the President had no choice . Because the Democrats controlled Congress , he supposedly had to accepta deal that raised taxes in order to reduce the deficit . If deficit reduction had been the true goal , however , the Administration could have accepted a sequester  --  Gramm  --  Rudman 's spending-control mechanism . Since a sequester would have occurred automatically in the absence of a budget agreement , the President did not need much congressional support . So long as he had enough votes to sustain his veto in either the House or the Senate , he would have won . Once a sequester took effect , the President could have used his tremendous leverage to force real entitlement and budget-process reforms in exchange for reducing the sequester 's size to a more politically acceptable level . <p> The Administration apparently decided , however , that the federal budget was more important than the family budget , so the sequestration option was quickly dismissed in favor of cutting a deal with Congress . The effect of this fateful decision was to give Senate Majority Leader George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foley ( D. , Wash. ) effective veto power , since no budget could pass without their approval . Given this unilateral abandonment of political power to the legislative branch , it is no wonder the President wound up signing a bill that so closely reflected the preferences of congressional Democrats . <p> Since the damage has already been done for this year , rather than further post-mortems , a more productive exercise might be to analyze what the budget disaster portends for next year . Unfortunately , the outlook is grim . The same White House that meekly acquiesced to Democrats ' demands , and that had earlier kowtowed to Chinese thugs , pulled no punches when it came to punishing natural allies who stood firm against taxes . The U.S. Chamber of Commerce 's firm opposition to taxes  --  unusual in the Washington business community , which is normally more concerned with buying favors than with protecting free enterprise  --  motivated the White House to bully some corporations into dropping their membership in that organization . <p> Those Republican senators and representatives who stuck with their no-tax-increase pledges attracted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seats in the presidential box at the Kennedy Center withdrawn because he said would vote no . On a more serious note , the White House is doing everything it can , including running a puppet candidate , to unseat National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Guy Vander Jagt . His crime : supporting Ed Rollins , the Committee 's executive director , who tried to minimize election losses by advising Republican candidates to stick to their no-tax-increase promises . See also " The Enemy of My Enemy , " p. 24 . <p> The White House has even purged remaining conservatives at the Republican . National Committee , including I ) on Todd ( former RNC " Man of the Year " ) and his team in the Opposition Research division . Bush might not be President today were it not for the evidence of Dukakis 's pathetic record on taxes , crime , and values that Todd and his staff amassed , but their commitment to principle made them expendable regardless of how well they did their jobs . Speaking of the RNC , the disabling illness of Chairman Lee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observers feel Atwater was the one person who might , through his political acumen and personal influence , have been able to keep Bush from breaking his pledge and stumbling into a bad budget deal . <p> Most troubling of all , it appears that the tax-and-spend budget agreement is merely a symptom of a more fundamental opposition to conservative values and beliefs that has taken hold inside the Bush White House . If this trend goes unchallenged , George Bush may well continue to stumble down the road to Carternomics , undoing the accomplishments of Ronald Reagan . It is time for conservatives to decide whether those accomplishments are worth preserving . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) <p> By DANIEL J. MITCHELL <p> <p> Mr. Mitchell is John M.
