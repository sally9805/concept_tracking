What to expect : Companies that can rev up earnings will shine . Overseas markets will boom . What to do : Choose funds that favor growth stocks . Keep 15% in funds that invest abroad . For mutual fund investors in 1995 , the basic prescription is simple : With the U.S. economy slowing , fill up on domestic funds favoring growth stocks that figure to appreciate 12% or more . And to benefit from a rising economic tide overseas , invest up to 15% of the money you have earmarked for equities in funds that buy foreign shares . Here 's why , starting with the case for growth funds . In general , growth stocks and value stocks take turns topping the market . ( Growth stocks are shares in companies that historically have been able to boost earnings by 15% a year or more . Value stocks are those selling below the per-share worth of their issuers ' assets or future earnings . ) For the past two years , value was in vogue , as the recovery that began in the spring of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the value-stock index kept by Prudential Securities has outperformed its growth counterpart 28.9% to 14.7% since the beginning of 1992 . Remember what happened to the Democrats on Election Day ? Well , look for a similar shift in national leadership to occur in the stock market next year . With economic growth expected to slow half a point or so to 2.5% to 3% in 1995 , many strategists , including MONEY 's Michael Sivy , believe the market is poised to favor growth shares . Why ? In a downshifting economy like 1995 's , high-torque cyclical outfits that rev highest during the early stages of an expansion typically cede market leadership to sportier growth stocks that can more dependably churn out double-digit earnings gains . Moreover , growth stocks are selling at very attractive prices these days . Recently , the price/earnings ratio of the average growth stock was just 1.8 times that of the typical value stock , according to the Leuthold Group , a Minneapolis stock research firm . The last time that ratio was below 2 was in mid-1988 . Over the next 2-1/2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while value stocks advanced 48.9% . Says Leuthold analyst James Floyd of the current outlook : " Growth stocks look reasonable compared with value stocks and have begun to take the lead again . " To help you profit from this likely change in relative performance , we have identified nine superior mutual funds that specialize in domestic growth stocks . All have outperformed the average U.S. equity fund over the past five years and are optimally positioned to thrive in ' 95 . In the profiles below , you 'll notice that most have substantial holdings in technology and health care , two sectors that many analysts believe possess the best growth opportunities of the ' 90s . " The producers of today 's capital goods  --  computer hardware and software and telecommunications equipment  --  will be the premier growth stocks , " says Edward Yardeni , chief economist of the Wall Street firm C.J. Lawrence/Deutsche Bank And with Republicans in control of Congress , the threat of health-care legislation that would crimp drug and hospital company profits has grown even more remote . We have divided our nine domestic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capitalization ( total value of outstanding shares ) of the companies they hold . By and large , small-cap funds invest in companies with market values of $1 billion or less ; midcaps , in those pegged between $1 billion and $5 billion ; and large-caps , in firms worth more than $5 billion . Our neck-on-the-line prediction for ' 95 : If growth is king next year as we expect , our nine growth funds should average gains of 12% , compared with total returns of 10% or so for the S &P; 500 . The argument for owning funds that invest in foreign stocks in 1995 is simple : Economic growth in many nations around the world will outpace that of the U.S. in 1995 , and foreign stock markets will show bigger advances as well . Double-digit gains could emerge in Europe where economic recoveries are taking hold on the Continent , as well as from markets in Latin America and Asia  --  already rebounding from early 1994 downturns of as much as 15% . Reflecting the variety of conditions abroad , the three foreign funds we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outstanding performers that figure to return 15% or more in ' 95 . Detailed description of our choices appear below . All are no-loads except where noted ; they are presented alphabetically within their categories . Small-cap growth Fund manager ( and cover subject ) Richard Aster , 54 , gobbles up growth with his Meridian Fund , but only if the price is right . " I have heard growth fund managers say that they really like a stock so much they do not care what the valuation is , " says Aster , pictured opposite . " We do care . " Aster seeks companies that are generating earnings spurts of 15% or more a year , and he prefers to buy them when their price/earnings ratios are lower than their growth rates . As a result , the 35 fast-growing stocks in $246 million Meridian recently had a reasonable average P/E ratio of 18 times estimated 1995 earnings , not far above the P/E of 15 for the big-cap S &P; 500 and 14.8 for the small-company Russell 2000 . That has proved to be a formula for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a 16.3% annual rate , vs. 11.8% for the average small-company fund . And buying cheaply helps limit downswings . " Aster has delivered consistently above-average performance while holding down the risk , " says Craig Litman , co-editor of the No-Load Fund Analyst ( $195 a year ; 800-776-9555 ) . Aster 's price discipline applies to selling decisions , as well . When he believes a stock is overvalued , he will ditch it even if he still likes the business . And he 's not afraid to sit on his hands . Recently , Aster had 30% of the portfolio in cash . " We are not making a call that we expect a market downturn , " he explains . " We just can not find enough stocks to buy . " The stocks he has bought have positioned him well in market sectors likely to excel in ' 95 . For example , 14% of his portfolio is in cellular-telephone stocks like $1.6 billion AirTouch and $250 million Cellular Communications . He has an additional 8% in technology issues and 12% in health-care shares like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outpatient surgical centers . If you want to go all out for growth in 1995 , you might hitch a ride with $650 million PBHG Growth . But fasten your seat belt . While the fund raced to outsize gains of 51.8% in 1991 and 48.6% in 1993 , it skidded badly during the first half of 1994 , dropping 15.7% , double the 7.9% loss for the average small-cap fund . By mid-November , however , PBHG Growth had moved back on track , up 1.1% for the year ( vs. a 1% loss for the typical small-capper ) . Manager Gary Pilgrim , 54 , and his staff of 12 analysts scrutinize a database of 400 companies with projected annual earnings growth rates of 20% or more . To find the 80 stocks most likely to succeed in that group of growth getters , Pilgrim &; Co. assess the " quality " of each company 's earnings via such indicators as whether profits consistently come in above analysts ' estimates . The portfolio , with an average market value of $475 million , recently included companies with a five-year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the average small-company fund . Technology stocks such as $107 million Zebra Technologies , a maker of bar code printers , accounted for 30% of assets . Another 22% was in consumer companies like $120 million Cobra Golf , a clubmaker . And 21% was in health issues such as $438 million Health Management Associates , an operator of rural hospitals . A veteran of small-cap investing , 34-year-old T. Rowe Price New Horizons can still jab like boxing champ George Foreman . Manager John Laporte , 49 , led the $1.2 billion fund to a 22% gain in 1993 , compared with 17.1% for the average small-cap fund . In 1994 , the fund was up 0.1% through Nov. 11 , while the average small-cap fund had lost 1% . And Laporte 's fondness for stocks with flashy track records ( his selections recently averaged a five-year annual growth rate of 27% ) should help it catch the growth-stock tail wind in 1995 . With big stakes in technology ( 20% ) and health care ( 16% ) , the 100-stock portfolio resembles many of its growth-seeking peers . Laporte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with or without sweeping reform legislation  --  will benefit prized healthcare holdings such as $3.7 billion HMO operator United Healthcare ( for more on United Healthcare , see page 44 ) . Midcap growth Lead manager Alexander Macmillan , 41 , of $597 million Columbia Growth has mastered the tricky game of moving in and out of market segments to catch big upswings . Over the past three years , the fund logged an annual 12.1% average gain , vs. 9.6% for the typical equity fund . Heading into 1995 , Macmillan has 16% of the fund 's assets in technology issues such as $24.8 billion Hewlett-Packard ; 9% in health-care stocks like $11 billion Columbia/HCA Healthcare ; and 7% in energy issues such as $515 million Anadarko Petroleum , a natural gas producer . That puts Macmillan right in sync with MONEY 's 1995 forecast  --  which calls for strong performance by energy stocks-setting up 100-stock Columbia Growth for another outstanding year . Doug Johnson , 40 , has made big bets in stocks large and small throughout his 10-year tenure at the helm of $470 million Safeco Equity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The fund has averaged gains of 16.5% a year over the past 10 years and 14.1% annually over the past five  --  four to five percentage points a year better than the average equity fund . And this year , Safeco jumped 11.4% through Nov. 12 , while the average equity fund lost 1.2% . The fund 's holdings range from small-company zoomers like Callaway Golf ( for more on Callaway , see page 70 ) to such big-company boomers as $2.6 billion media giant Knight-Ridder . The mix of 90 large and small companies gives the portfolio a median size that puts it squarely in midcap territory . Johnson , who prefers to buy at a discount , recently had 14% of fund assets in technology stocks and 10% in utilities like $20.1 billion phone-service provider GTE . He likes such telephone utilities for their high dividends ; GTE yields 6% , vs. 2.7% for the S &P; 500 . Lead manager Howard Schow , 67 , fills the 80-stock portfolio of $1.4 billion Vanguard/Primecap with high-growth companies that are temporarily ( he hopes ) out of favor with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their wings to give Vanguardi Primecap average annual returns of 13.4% over the past five years , vs. 9.6% for the average equity fund . And Primecap ran ahead of the pack in 1994 as well , with a 11.7% gain to Nov. 11 , vs. a 1.2% loss for the average equity fund . Schow 's prospects for 1995 hinge on the budding rebound in technology stocks , which account for 33% of the portfolio . Two of his favorites are European : $1.7 billion Vodafone of Great Britain , a cellular-phone service provider ; and $11 billion Ericsson Telephone of Sweden , an equipment maker . Schow , who has run Primecap since 1984 , also has a 8% position in the troubled airline and transportation sectors , where he believes cost cutting will produce higher profits next year . Large-cap growth Spiros ( Sig ) Segalas ( pictured on page 34 ) is looking overseas for growth in 1995 . Segalas , 60 , who has managed Harbor Capital Appreciation to average annual gains of 18% over his 4-1/2-year tenure ( vs. 11% for the S &P; 500 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stocks . He also had major holdings in U.S. companies with sizable stakes overseas . The latter group included $17 billion Coca-Cola , which gets 64% of its earnings from abroad ; $8 billion McDonald 's , with more than 40% foreign profits ; and two big technology firms : $4.7 million Microsoft and $22 billion Motorola . Segalas believes his stocks will notch 1995 earnings gains of 26% on average , far better than the projected 11.5% profit growth of the S &P.; Says Segalas : " I think that stacks the odds in my favor for 1995 . " Harbor 's sector holdings fit the familiar growth pattern for 1995 . Technology stocks , including the two noted above , account for 40% of the fund 's assets . Another 13% of the portfolio is in health-care issues , including drugmakers $8.2 billion Pfizer and $3.8 million Astra , a Swedish firm . Segalas says he limits his holdings to 60 stocks , selling an issue whenever he wants to buy a new one . One benefit of that limit , he says : " Often that forces me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long otherwise . " Although 125-stock IDS New Dimensions recently had 77% of its portfolio in stocks that are part of the S &P; 500 , it has outperformed that big-cap index during the past five years , with average annual gains of 13.7% , vs. 9.1% for the S &P.; And it has shone both in tough years such as 1990 ( up 5.4% , vs. a 5.8% loss for the average equity fund ) and in boom years like 1991 , when it soared 50.7% , vs. 36.8% for the average fund . Gordon Fines , 49 , who has managed this $4.3 billion , 5%-load fund since 1991 , recently increased his technology stake to 29% ( from 18% last spring ) , adding such major players as $14.6 billion Xerox and $10.8 billion Compaq Computer . Fines also has 6% of the portfolio in energy stocks , including $105 billion Royal Dutch Petroleum and $25.6 billion Amoco . The dominance of cyclicals over growth stocks for the past two years has been especially hard on the $9.5 billion Janus Fund ( up 19.9% since the start of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But with growth coming back into style , James Craig , 38 , who has managed Janus since 1986 , figures to return to form . Craig has relinquished responsibility for Janus Venture to focus his attention on the flagship . And he 's added four analysts ( for a total of 18 ) to help him ride herd on Janus ' 110-stock portfolio . " We continue to have great confidence in Craig 's ability as a stock picker , " says Ken Gregory , co-editor of the No-Load Fund Analyst . Gregory predicts that Janus will resume its above-average performance next year . Like Segalas of Harbor Capital , Craig expects a boost from foreign stocks . A hefty 21% of the fund 's assets are touring in overseas shares , including $35 billion Philips Electronics and $1.6 billion Wolters Kluwer , a Netherlands-based publisher . Overseas With economic recovery just taking hold in most of the countries of continental Europe , $524 million Tweedy Browne Global Value seems especially well set for 1995 : 63% of its assets are in European stocks . That allocation , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a love of underpriced stocks . Says John Spears , 46 , one of the fund 's four managers : " Europe is where we find the best values . " Indeed , this year-old fund with a small-company bias ( median market value of its 180 stocks : $780 million ) is run on strict value principles . Spears explains that prospective purchases must fall into one of two categories . The first is stocks that look cheap in relation to their assets or book value . These tend to be slumbering cyclicals that should rebound with the revived economy , such as Guillard Musique , a $57 million French retailer of musical instruments and recordings , selling at just 70% of its book value . Category two : stocks with low price/earnings ratios , such as $225 million Dutch fiber-optic cable maker Twentsche Kabel , selling at just 4.1 times its past 12 months ' earnings . Investors who worry that a rebound in the dollar from its current historic lows could wipe out overseas gains in 1995 should note that Tweedy Browne uses currency futures to protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on page 38 ) , has proved adept at spotting the companies and industries that are ready to outperform the rest of the world . ( Picture omitted ) In the past five years , his $262 million USAA International has turned in a 10.2% return annually , compared with 7.2% for the average international fund . Right now , Peebles , who has run the fund since 1984 , holds a mixture of value and growth stocks . His favorites include Autoliv , a $1.2 billion Swedish firm that makes air bags for auto manufacturers . Autoliv 's earnings are expected to jump 20% to 25% a year over the next five years in part because its biggest customer , Volvo , plans to equip its cars with side air bags in addition to frontal ones . USAA International 's holdings total 122 stocks in 31 countries . Peebles ' biggest concentrations are in Europe , where he has 37% of his assets , and Japan , which accounts for 25% , down from 30% earlier this year . ( A 22% surge in the Tojo market helped the fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the average international fund . ) Peebles also has 19% in Asian markets outside Japan and 9% in Latin America . " We have always leaned toward emerging markets , " says Peebles . " And we think these holdings will do well for us in 1995 . " A knack for being in the right market at the right time has helped Richard King lead Warburg Pincus International to average annual returns of 13.2% for the past five years , nearly double the average international fund 's 7.1% . This year , the $1.3 billion fund is up 7.8% , vs. 1.6% for the average entry . King , 49 , got a boost from his 27% stake in Japan and a 6% position in the strong Korean market . He also has 26% in Europe , mainly in cyclical issues . In 1995 , the fund should also get some juice from emerging markets . King , who for nearly a decade was an investment analyst in Hong Kong , has 30% of assets in Pacific Rim countries outside Japan and another 9% in Latin America . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a median $2.7 billion . He explains : " We typically look at smaller companies , because that 's where we are likeliest to find strong growth . " And for investors like you , going for growth will be the best bet for big profits in 1995 . A global quest for bargains For a solid shot at a total return of 15% or more in 1995 , Tweedy Browne Global Value is our choice as your best fund bet . Tweedy is run on classic value principles . That is , the four managers  --  Chris Browne , Will Browne , John Spears and James Clark Jr .  --  insist on buying issues that appear cheap compared with their earnings or assets . And while growth stocks seem likely to dominate the U.S. market , Tweedy 's value-seeking approach will be more suited to many overseas markets , especially those in Europe , where economic activity should surge in ' 95 . Furthermore , Spears believes that over the long term , bargain hunting transcends market cycles . " In our experience , " he says , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returns . " <p>
