CHINA 'S COMMUNIST LEADERS ARE having a bad dream . In it they see Lee Teng-hui , Taiwan 's assertive chief executive , being re-elected next month in the first direct presidential balloting in the history of China . They see Lee , flashing his broad grin , standing in the well of the U.S. House of Representatives , addressing a joint meeting of Congress . And they see him moving on to other world capitals to take a bow as the head of a distinct , democratic and economically powerful state on Chinese soil . <P> That is the Beijing nightmare , but it may not be a fantasy . Something similar might actually happen . Lee is expected to win the March 23 election handily , and some of his friends in Congress are thinking about inviting him to Washington . Other countries that do business with Taiwan are watching the U.S. , considering whether to send invitations of their own . To many , not just those in Beijing , this looks very much like a road that leads to Taiwan 's independence , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Beijing considers its one-China policy inviolable , is determined to keep Taiwan from declaring itself a separate state , and threatens to use force if necessary to prevent it . Though China 's armed forces would have a hard time carrying it out , no one takes the threat lightly . <P> Mao Zedong , the leader of the communist revolution that forced Chiang Kai-shek and his Nationalist government to flee to the island of Taiwan in 1949 , used to say he could wait 100 years to bring the province back into the fold . Today 's men in Beijing are less patient , perhaps sensing that Taiwan is growing stronger and more distant all the time . Last week , in a formal speech at the Great Hall of the People , Premier Li Peng lectured the citizens of the island : No matter how they might choose their President , " they can not change the fact that Taiwan is part of China and its leaders are only leaders of a region in China . " Beijing prefers a peaceful reunification , said Li , the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but we have not forsworn the use of force . " Foreign Ministry spokesman Chen Jian even suggested a timetable of sorts , saying that after China reclaims Hong Kong in 1997 and Macau in 1999 , then Taiwan will be " high on the agenda of the Chinese people . " <P> Even in the short run Beijing is intensifying pressure , doing its best to influence the coming election and stifle Taiwan 's efforts to increase its international standing . During the cold war , the government in Taipei officially agreed with Beijing that there was only one China and Taiwan was part of it . Now Lee , a native-born Taiwanese , favors a kind of peaceful coexistence and prolonged status quo . Three years ago , Taiwan said it intended to rejoin the U.N . " as soon as possible , " not as China , but as an entity with as much legitimacy as , say , South Korea . Last month Senegal became the 31st country to establish diplomatic relations with Taiwan . Beijing , says Bertrand Tsai , a political scientist at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole world may reconsider its policy on Taiwan . "
