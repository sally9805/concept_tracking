In spite of passionate speeches by Rev. Jesse Jackson and others and the threat of lawsuits , the Regents of the University of California voted to end 30 years of affirmative action in admissions and hiring . California Governor Pete Wilson has made dismantling affirmative action a cornerstone of his presidential campaign even though he supported the measure as mayor of San Diego in the 1970s . Jackson told the Regents of the massive nine-campus , 162,000 student system : " We urge the Regents to do what is morally right , and appeal to you to maintain affirmative action . Seven out of nine U.S. Supreme Court justices say that race should be a factor , because racism and sexism are still real . President Clinton 's federal review and call for renewal of affirmative action corroborate what we all know too well  --  glass ceilings for women and closed doors for African Americans and Latinos . ' He pointed out Blacks make up only 2.4 percent of the University of California faculty and Latinos 4.2 per cent although they make up 10 percent and 30 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say : " Arguing for colorblind and gender blind admissions is a lot like praising virtue ; it 's easy to say but hard to do . " Willie Brown , who for 15 years was Speaker of the California Assembly and is a former Rent himself , warned the body not to politicize the issue . " To vote to change affirmative action , ahead of the people , ahead of a court order , ahead of a constitutional amendment , ahead of any statute would be to move the Regents into the arena of politics . And once there , extrication becomes an impossibility . " He also pointed out to Regents that because of affirmative action , he was able to attend San Francisco State University in 1951 . " Within six weeks I was performing equal to any other student in that body . And , of course , I graduated , entered this university ( U.C.-San Francisco ) and graduated from law school and qualified as a practicing lawyer . Affirmative action extended to me , the opportunity to do that . " The move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Black and Hispanic students admitted into the giant system . White males and Asian-Americans are expected to see their numbers increase . And White male contractors who do business with the system are expected to see greater benefits . Black enrollment actually has not increased in the system over the last 20 years , studies showed . Jackson said that because California often sets the tone for the rest of the nation , he fears the move could have far-reaching national consequences . " July 20 will live a long time in California history , " he said after the vote . What we are seeing here tonight is a blatant act of racism . " The move to defeat affirmative action was sponsored by Ward Connerly a Black Sacramento businessman who some Black politicians have charged has benefitted tremendously from the system he wants dismantled . The move was opposed by a large number of faculty and multiracial student groups . The nine-campus system had based admission on a combination of academic merit , geographical location , ethnicity , gender and special talents . According to the L.A. Times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on race . At least 18 of the 26 Regents were appointees of Republican governors . <p>
