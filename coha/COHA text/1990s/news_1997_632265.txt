<p> Why do n't people get dressed anymore ? <p> Wait , let me rephrase that . They dress  --  since Midwestern climate , basic decorum and in most of our cases aesthetic considerations all conspire against us performing our daily tasks sporting the state in which we entered the world  --  but they do n't get dressed , with a captial D. <p> Think of a favorite film from the black and white era , and think of the clothes . <p> Fred Astaire was always beautifully turned out , as were Douglas Fairbanks and Cary Grant . Think about cinematic classics such as " Bringing Up Baby , " when Grant invited Katharine Hepburn to dinner , and showed up for the evening in a white tie and tails . She , quite naturally , was devastating in an evening gown ( our cover image ) . <p> All the other restaurant guests were every bit as natty , because this was the thing to do in a day and age where going out was still a Special Event . <p> So , when did we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our attire ? Even in the business world we 're dressing down . <p> Some say the Gap did it , with its chic slouch , instigating the Casual Fridays trend that has begun to stretch its tentacles into our everyday lives . Suddenly , Monday through Thursday are casual as well . Yet in this unconstructed , loose-fitting decade , signs of a stylistic renaissance are beginning to make themselves seen . <p> Look at the recent lounge music craze , in which retro stylists are doing takedowns of ' 30s and ' 40s jazz stylings . Bands such as the Mighty Blue Kings and Royal Crown Revue are not only musical , but sartorial throwbacks as well . The band members sport slick , vintage suits ; French cuffed shirts , and gleaming , polished footwear . <p> Devotees of these bands , as well as the musical genre itself , have adapted period dress . Men are showing up in natty , double-breasted suits , the women in gowns , as couples touch-dance , sip martinis , and go about the business of looking oh-so-cool . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night on the town is still special . It makes men puff out their chests and don their finest suitings , while women automatically reach for nice skirts and dresses . <p> Here are some places that call for sartorial eloquence , as opposed to the disheveled silhouette too many of us present to the world . <p> THE PUMP ROOM <p> This restaurant is one of those places that remains an unassailable bastion of elegance . . . at least until New Year 's Day , after which renovations begin at the Ambassador East Hotel , and the Pump Room closes . A date for reopening has not been set . Since 1938 , jackets have been required for male patrons , with no exceptions . Phil Collins might have released a disc titled " No Jacket Required , " but he could n't dine at the Pump Room because he did n't have a jacket . Jacketless megarockers U2 , although they were hotel guests , had to come up with alternate dining plans in the face of the refreshingly resolute Pump Room policy . " It just sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manager . " Our captains are still in tuxedos and bow ties . But the room demands it . It 's a rare environment . " The Pump Room , located at 1300 N. State Pkwy. in the Ambassador East Hotel , has a supply of jackets for men who might not have packed one . For information and reservations , call ( 312 ) 266-0360 . <p> NARCISSE <p> One place where an elegant state is all the rage is Narcisse , 710 N. Clark ( 312-787-2675 ) . ( Even though the venue is not open on New Year 's Eve due to a private party , it 's worth a high place on your list of resolutions for 1998 ! ) For those who might not know , this is a " champagne and caviar bar . " And as you might imagine , the self-indulgent decadence of those two treats is sufficient to bring out the swell in patrons at Narcisse . <p> " It 's a wide range of ages that come in here , and everyone 's trying to look their best , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's OK to dress up and go out , as long as they 're going somewhere that the ambience of the room fits what they are wearing , " Sullivan said . <p> Sullivan attributes the deconstructed attitude of the ' 90s to athletic wear getting a run outside of health clubs . <p> " I blame it all on the jogging suit , " Sullivan said . " People began wearing those outside of the gym . . . now everyone goes to the mall in a sloppy old jump suit . But it 's kind of swung back . People are dressing up and splurging on themselves a bit . I 'm hoping it 's a trend that will last . " <p> WILLOWBROOK BALLROOM <p> Trends are one thing , while history is yet another , which brings us to the Willowbrook Ballroom , still one of the places in town where you 're most likely to see a tuxedo , even if no one is getting married or serving dinner . <p> Into its 76th year , the Willowbrook offers ballroom dancing to big band sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Sundays from 2 to 5:30 p.m . If you 're looking for a place where style and elegance reign , look no further , as skirts twirl and suited men stride confidently , creating a scene that must resemble the overhead shots from a Busby Berkeley musical . <p> " There 's starting to be more interest in ballroom dancing and live music thanks to the renewed interest in swing dancing , " said Patricia Williams , granddaughter of the ballroom 's founder . " It 's an opportunity to dress up , and there are n't very many anymore . " <p> The Willowbrook Ballroom , 8900 S. Archer in Willow Springs , has several New Year 's Eve packages available . For information , call ( 708 ) 839-1000 . <p> LYRIC OPERA <p> Lyric Opera of Chicago is at the top of any list of places that cry for , scream for , indeed , sing an aria for lovely clothing . ( Resolve to visit Lyric in 1998 . ) <p> The Civic Opera House , 20 N. Wacker , is , on performance nights , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a peacock farm . <p> Yes , there are those who attend a Lyric presentation in jeans , or other such casual attire , but they 're weird . Grand stagings , exquisite music and the Civic Opera House 's stately architecture are inspiration enough . Most Lyric patrons are dressed , if not quite to kill , certainly to watch a Puccini heroine be killed . <p> Opening nights are the best time to catch such finery , which includes many a tuxedo , or evening gown . Obviously , longer operas such as Wagnerian epics might not be the best occasion for dressing to the nines . Hey , after more than five hours of " Gotterdammerung , " you 're ready to do anything for comfort , including stripping naked . For information , call ( 312 ) 332-2244 . <p> THE DRAKE <p> Finally , for you Anglophiles who think of rainy days in London , steaming pots of crystal-clear water and loose tea leaves in proper strainers can boogie over to the Drake Hotel for afternoon tea . <p> Think finger foods coupled with a choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More importantly , the genteel ambience of the ancient , dignified hotel 's Palm Court makes some patrons opt for a higher level of attire , as well . <p> Tea , intended to bridge that chronological gap between the end of lunchtime and the beginning of the evening , is served from 2:30 to 5 p.m. daily  --  yes , this includes Jan. 1  --  at the Drake , 140 E. Walton . Call ( 312 ) 787-2200 . ( The Drake also will host a dinner and gala on New Year 's Eve . ) <p> The apprehensive , who think of dressing up as daunting , can consider it a reconnecting with a calmer time . <p> " I always hear comments about how nice it is to see people all dressed up , " Williams said . " And people do behave differently . The decorum that people exhibit here is extraordinary . It 's very refreshing . "
