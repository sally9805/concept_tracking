A group of TV executives from Eastern Europe confessed at a CNN conference last month that the newly freed TV channels in their countries have left viewers bored . The problem : too much news and not enough entertainment . Just another case where the former Soviet empire has a lot of catching up to do &; with the West . In the jaded U.S. , viewers are bored with entertainment and ca n't seem to get enough news . <P> At least , they ca n't get enough of the networks ' prime-time news programs . CBS 's venerable 60 Minutes , the closest thing to a perpetual-motion machine yet developed by network TV , is riding higher than ever as the most watched show on television . ABC 's PrimeTime Live , after a rocky shakedown period , has emerged as a solid ratings success , while its older sibling , 20/20 , is still going strong after 13 seasons . Back at CBS , 48 Hours ( which departs from the newsmagazine format by focusing on one subject for an hour in cinema-verite fashion ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spin-off : Street Stories , which did well enough in four outings last month to win a renewal through the summer . <P> These shows are increasingly the forum of choice for headlinemakers . Democratic presidential contender Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary went on 60 Minutes to respond to charges of marital infidelity  --  breaking their plans to appear on other news interview shows in order to ensure a bigger audience . Patricia Bowman , the woman who accused William Kennedy Smith of rape , shed her anonymity with Diane Sawyer on PrimeTime Live . Anita Hill appeared last week on 60 Minutes for her first TV interview since the Clarence Thomas hearings . <P> The boom shows no signs of slackening . NBC , the one network conspicuously left off the prime-time news bandwagon , will try again in late March with a new show , Dateline NBC , co-anchored by Jane Pauley and Stone Phillips . And ABC is currently assembling the staff for yet another news hour , which will compete head-to-head with 60 Minutes on Sunday nights , perhaps as early as this summer . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense : they cost only half as much to produce as entertainment programs , and a successful one can run virtually forever . Viewers , for their part , may be turning to news out of exasperation with the sameness of network entertainment fare . Andrew Heyward , executive producer of 48 Hours , theorizes that short newsmagazine segments suit the habits of zap-happy viewers . " Unlike a drama show , " he says , " you do n't have to watch the whole hour to get something out of it . " PrimeTime Live executive producer Richard Kaplan contends that people are " hungry for information , " possibly because of the hard economic times . " Maybe there 's a correlation between people 's interest in what 's going on and their own economic situation , " he says .
