EYES ON THE PRIZE II ; PBS , debuting Jan. 15 , 9 p.m. on most stations <P> When we last left the civil rights movement , at the end of the 1987 PBS documentary series Eyes on the Prize , it had just survived a violent clash with state troopers outside Selma , Ala . The confrontation climaxed a remarkable decade of civil rights activity that followed the 1954 Supreme Court decision outlawing segregation . Eyes on the Prize II , an eight-week continuation of that story , plunges us into a much different world . Malcolm X , Stokely Carmichael and other firebrands have emerged to challenge the movement 's old guard and question its tactics . If Eyes on the Prize recounted the inspiring opening act of the civil rights struggle , the follow-up series presents a more complex and disturbing Act II . <P> The cast of characters is larger , the moral positions less clear-cut , the progress not always forward . The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr . and his followers move their desegregation campaign to Northern cities like Chicago , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Bobby Seale sound as threatening as the white racists they oppose . Riots break out in Watts , Detroit , and Attica prison . Meanwhile , the nation undergoes a virtual revolution of race consciousness . Negroes are transformed into blacks , Afro hairstyles become a political statement , and the rise of a sassy young heavyweight named Cassius Clay has reverberations far beyond the boxing ring . <P> Though Eyes on the Prize was one of the most acclaimed series in PBS history , producer Henry Hampton had difficulty lining up financial support for a sequel . Several corporations reportedly were uneasy about underwriting a series that would deal with more controversial material . Actually , Eyes II steers its way through the turbulent era with admirable calm and impartiality . The unfailingly judicious narration ( spoken by Julian Bond ) at times seems restrained to the point of timidity . <P> Still , Eyes II is about as good as TV documentaries get . The old news footage , of course , is irresistible : scenes of marchers in Cicero , Ill. , or crowds chanting " Free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LP of the Supremes ' greatest hits . But the filmmakers have made unexpected finds as well , like rare glimpses of King 's aides debating strategy before the 1968 Poor People 's March on Washington . ( King interrupted these planning sessions to travel to Memphis , where garbage men were on strike and where he would be assassinated . ) <P> But Eyes II stands out also for the intelligent , graceful way all this material has been assembled . Each episode has an organizing theme ( the movement goes north ; the emergence of black pride ) and a dramatic arc that builds toward climactic episodes marking key milestones . What makes the series most satisfying , however , are the interviews with onetime partisans who look back with surprising insight and clearheadedness . It 's the sight of a graying Carmichael smiling as he recalls a phone conversation with King just before King came out publicly against the Viet Nam War . Or Ron Scott , whose apartment was raided by National Guardsmen during the Detroit riots , explaining , " Inside of most black people there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was about to overflow . " If the historian 's job is to bring some sort of order and sense to events that once seemed chaotic and frightening , then Eyes II deserves top prize .
