The great wall of China snakes like a stern dragon through the opening shots of Mulan , a strange and beguiling new breed of Disney animated feature . This is , in part , a war movie that understands loss , desolation , death . Power and discipline are the motifs here : bending your will and others ' , bending the system while working within it . The villain , a crazed , WWF-style hulkster named Shan-Yu , has no comic irony softening his brute trapezoidal lines . He 's just an evil machine with vampire teeth . The Wall , the vast plains and hills , the Forbidden City itself , all cringe at his shadow . <P> In other words , this is strong , supple entertainment , not a girlish cartoon in the style of The Little Mermaid , in which a girl becomes a woman . Here , a girl becomes a man . Mulan is the only child of a dutiful man tied to tradition . " I know my place , " he tells his rebellious tomboy of a daughter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , it turns out , is at the head of a ragtag platoon fighting Shan-Yu 's Huns . This woman warrior will prove that the art of war is the smart of war , that one wins by cunning , not strength . And unlike most Disney heroines , she achieves her goal without much mentoring . As her sidekick , a spindly dragon named Mushu , proudly says , " You da man ! " <P> Mulan is the first feature from Disney 's Florida unit  --  those people who try to get work done as Walt Disney World tourists gawk at them through the huge windows of the animation pavilion . It does n't seem to have distracted them a whit , for the team , led by directors Barry Cook and Tony Bancroft and producer Pam Coats , has created the boldest , most persuasive storytelling in a while , in a ravishing pastel palette ( from production designer Hans Bacher ) that recalls the color experiments of Fantasia as much as the delicacy of Chinese graphic art . <P> Yes , yes , it 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at first , in a matchmaker scene that seems to revel in inflicting pain  --  and yearning romance . It has some star voices , like Eddie Murphy , very funny as the Mushu shrimp , and a fine cast of East Asian and Asian-American actors ( Ming-Na Wen , B.D. Wong , Soon-Tek Oh , James Shigeta ) playing the main characters . But what 's terrific about Mulan is its reaching for emotions that other movies run from : family love and duty , personal honor and group commitment , obedience and ingenuity . Nice notions for kids to think about . <P> The four songs , by Matthew Wilder and David Zippel , propel the plot with lyric efficiency . But then , at the end , the racy Eddie Murphy spirit that has been held in check during the film explodes with a Motownish rave-up , True to Your Heart , that cascades over the closing credits . The song does n't have much to do with the girl-power theme of this briskly enchanting film , but it 's a perky parting gift from the Disney folks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and harmonica riffs with some sassy horns , and euphoria saturates the multiplex . Cap your soda cup before dancing out of the theater . <P>  --  By Richard Corliss
