There goes another Soviet republic <p> Dateline : KIEV <p> For seven decades the Ukraine has been Europe 's hidden nation . Despite the fact that it was a granary for the Soviet Union , the source of one-fifth of its industrial output , and a training ground for Soviet leaders ( both Khrushchev and Brezhnev cut their political teeth here ) , culturally and politically the Ukraine did not exist under communism . But now the second most populous Soviet republic  --  a country the size of France , with a population of 52 million  --  is re-emerging , and the linchpin of the Soviet empire is coming loose . <p> Chernobyl started the process : the 1986 nuclear explosion occurred sixty miles from Kiev , worsening nuclear , chemical , and industrial pollution . Next came a cultural awakening , culminating in Ukrainian becoming the republic 's state language . Underlying all of it was the long-suppressed desire of the Ukrainians to reclaim the independence won between 1917 and 1921 by their forebears . <p> The Ukrainian revolution unofficially began last January , when as many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretching 300 miles from Kiev to Lvov . In March the democratic forces won more than a quarter of the seats in the republic 's parliament ( and two-thirds where their candidates were able to register ) . In June the government and the parliament agreed to a far-reaching declaration of Ukrainian sovereignty , which proclaimed that Ukrainian laws would take precedence over Soviet ones , called for a Ukrainian militia and army , and declared that the Ukraine would become a non-nuclear neutral state . On October 1 half a million Ukrainians marched on the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet in Kiev , demanding the resignation of the government . The protest was part of a day-long republic-wide general strike that , in the view of its organizers , the KGB had derailed by cutting phone lines and disinforming people about the day it would take place . Inexperienced revolutionaries , the Ukrainian strike leaders are unhappy with the fact that only 10 percent of the republic 's workers downed tools . <p> A day later dozens of students began a hunger strike , demanding the resignation of the Ukrainian prime minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shadow of the Lenin monument in the city center . Daily demonstrations of as many as 100,000 students and their supporters tied up city traffic . Within two weeks the authorities agreed to meet some of the students ' demands : Prime Minister Vitaly Masol ( an old Brezhnev crony ) resigned , and the parliament said it would hold a referendum within the next year on whether new elections should take place . Now , the parliament has begun passing laws to strengthen the declaration of sovereignty . In mid-October it voted to give Ukrainian citizens ( who make up a quarter of the Soviet army ) the right to fulfill their military service on Ukrainian territory . <p> The political force behind the Ukrainian revival is a coalition known as the Rukh ( Movement ) , the Ukraine 's answer to Poland 's Solidarity and Czechoslovakia 's Civic Forum . Formed a little more than a year ago by Ivan Drach , a middle-aged poet with a paunch and a new-found taste for stirring rhetoric , it now has 700,000 dues-paying members ( a threefold increase since last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Communist Party is losing thousands of members each week . <p> The Rukh ethos is pluralistic . It has a commission on national minorities headed by a Jewish activist , Yosif Zisels . The bonds to other nationalities were formed for many Rukh leaders in the gulag . At the Rukh 's second official congress in Kiev in October , warm applause greeted speakers from the democratic and nationalist movements of Russia , Byelorussia , Lithuania , Moldova ( the new name for Moldavia ) , Armenia , and Azerbaijan . The idea of the Ukraine just for the Ukrainians is unacceptable , ' says Rukh leader Dmytro Pavlychko . Ukrainians represent 75 percent of the population , Russians , 20 percent , and Jews , 1 percent ; other minorities include Poles and Hungarians . To win over non-Ukrainians , the Rukh is seeking to replace the notion of a nation-state for Ukrainians with the idea of a republic of Ukrainian citizens  --  a democratic , minority-friendly nationalism . <p> Vyacheslav Chornovil , the 53-year-old governor of the Lvov district and another gulag veteran , proposes a federal structure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educational and language policy , ' he told the congress . Such a formula , he insisted , will win over Russians , both in the Ukraine and in Russia , to the cause of Ukrainian independence . He has embarked on a program of rapid privatization of land and housing for the 3 million residents of his district , without Moscow 's approval . He said that the democratically controlled local governments of the Ukraine are concluding trade agreements and negotiating the distribution of resources while bypassing the central governments of both the Ukraine and the Soviet Union . <p> The Rukh congress was a hybrid  --  part political convention , part cultural happening  --  in which the hip and the prerevolutionary happily mingled . Young men with shaved heads and thick mustaches sauntered through the crowds dressed in cossack garb . A small band of troubadours dressed in the military uniform of the anti-Nazi and anti-Soviet Ukrainian Insurgent Army entertained the delegates during breaks in the proceedings . Vendors hawked hundreds of new independent newspapers and magazines that are reaching millions of readers . <p> At a concert held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post-punk band , belted out angry songs about urban youth , poverty , and sex . Unlike traditional Ukrainian protest songs , these are not laments , but spirited songs of anger and power . They reflect the sense that the enemy is now on the run . Looking like a cross between Madonna and Sinead O'Connor , and with a funk-accentuated horn section , Vika raps sardonically : I do n't want sausage , do n't want butter , do n't want fancy dining ; /All I want is for the Kremlin 's star to keep on shining . ' <p> If the fate of the Ukraine is being debated by the Rukh and the contours of the Ukrainian state are being shaped by the political experiments in Lvov and Kiev , where democrats have won control of the city council , its future will be determined in the vast , gritty industrial wastelands of the east . In the coal centers of the Donbass , a political consciousness is emerging  --  one based on an intense hatred of the reds . ' In Donetsk , where at a miners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first mass-based free trade union , the radical talk reflects the bleak realities of daily life . One jovial Ukrainian mine-worker leader jokes : Komunyaky na hilyaky . ' ( Commies to the gallows . ' ' ) <p> In Donetsk only the town center bears the traces of an older , more genteel order . For the most part the city is an eerie mixture of dilapidated postwar housing projects and pollution spewing out of inner-city chemical plants . Food scarcity is nearing a crisis . All food , even mineral water , is sold only to those who have a passport to prove they live here . Recently a young Donetsk worker , unable to feed his family , hung a noose over the Lenin statue in the city 's central square and hanged himself . <p> After the miners ' congress Yuri Boldyrev , an intellectual who has emerged as a key leader of Donetsk workers , rushed off to Kiev for an all-Ukrainian meeting of strike committees to plead for a common anti-Communist front ' to unite the Rukh with the less nationally conscious workers of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be so eager for Ukrainian statehood , but he recognizes that realpolitik requires a coalition with the main democratic force in the Ukraine . <p> Indeed , much of the breach that long separated east from west is rapidly being traversed . This summer half a million residents of the area around Zaporozhye , in the southern Ukraine , gathered for a kind of Ukrainian Woodstock . Ostensibly a celebration of 500 years of cossack glory , the event was an exercise in mass consciousness-raising . Nationalists from Kiev and Lvov used the traditions of the fiercely independent cossacks to reawaken local sentiments for independence from Moscow . It seems to have worked . In recent months busloads of political activists from the western Ukraine have been traveling to the smaller cities of the east and south , recruiting new converts to the Rukh and setting up small centers to organize for future elections . <p> In September 1989 the Rukh supported a cautious coalition with the reform elements of the Communist Party . Now the Rukh has backed Ukrainian statehood and has voted to exclude Communists from its ranks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months the Rukh will be entering into roundtable talks with the Communists : In the face of widespread economic collapse , I am sure that the authorities will ask us to form a government . ' Indeed , under growing public pressure ( an October 1990 poll shows Ukrainians favoring secession by two-to-one ) many of the Rukh 's demands have already been adopted by the Communist-controlled Ukrainian parliament . Barring a military crackdown , by next year the Rukh 's program for an independent democratic state is likely to be implemented  --  by a government in the Rukh 's hands . <p> By Adrian Karatnycky <p> <p> ADRIAN KARATNYCKY is co-author of The Hidden Nations : The People Challenge the Soviet Union ( Morrow ) . <p>
