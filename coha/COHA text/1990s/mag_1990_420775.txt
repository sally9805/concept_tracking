Section : News you can use ; Cover story ; 1991 investment guide <p> The best cure for an investor 's jitters in today 's volatile mutual-fund market is still a long lens on the future . You 're better off holding funds for the long term , say most advisers , than trying to predict which way the market will move next . <p> To help investors find the top performers , U.S. News asked Kanon Bloch Carre , a Boston brokerage that frequently ranks mutual funds for this magazine , for an exclusive list of the 100 best funds for 1991 , based on both their long-term and short-term performance . <p> Kanon Bloch divided its universe of 2,200 funds into 20 categories based on the funds ' investment objectives . There are 12 varieties of equity funds , six kinds of taxable bond funds and two types of tax-free funds . We have listed the top funds in each category . <p> Rankings are based on a fund 's overall-performance index ( OPI ) , a number between 0 and 100 . The OPI reflects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last 1 , 3 , 5 and 10-year periods and the last seven bear markets . Longer investment periods and more recent bear markets receive the most weight . You can compare OPI 's within any of the three fund areas : Equity ( stock ) , taxable and tax-free bonds . Because of scaling differences , you can not compare a stock fund 's OPI , for example , with that of a taxable bond fund . Kanon Bloch advises investors to hold only funds with OPI 's of 75 or more for the best long-term results . Each fund also receives a bear-market grade reflecting how total returns have held up relative to those of other funds in the last seven down cycles , including the one that began July 20 , 1990 . The higher the letter grade , the more likely that the fund will stay afloat in a market plunge .
