<p> This article provides practical and understandable examples of how much middle-income consumers actually pay in taxes when purchasing goods and services . We address the question by showing how much extra income someone must earn to pay for major purchases . In all of our examples we examine the taxes paid by a married couple with an income between $34,000 and $53,400 a year . <p> We take into account four types of taxes that raise the " true " price of a product . We ignore the impact of business taxes , which are ultimately borne by workers and the owners of capital . For wage earners we also ignore the employer portion of the FICA payroll taxes . Four taxes are examined . The income tax paid . We assume an income between $34,000 and $53,400 per year , which means a 28% marginal federal tax rate on all additional earnings . The payroll tax . For most workers ( with earnings up to $53,400 ) this constitutes a 7.65% tax on earnings on top of the income tax . The self-employed must pay a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 14.1% . The state income tax . Rates vary widely from state to state . They range from a low of zero in 10 states to a high of 12% in North Dakota . The state and local sales tax . Those taxes also vary from state to state and even among localities within states . The highest combined state and local sales tax rate is 10% in Louisiana , but many states have no sales tax . Tax Burden On a Car <p> In our first example we examine the amount of extra money a middle-income worker needs to earn to purchase a car in a state where taxes are typical , Michigan . Michigan taxpayers pay a 4.6% income tax on taxable income . ( For simplicity we ignore the personal exemption , the standard deduction and itemized deductions , except the state income tax deduction , in all analyses . ) Michigan also imposes a 4% nondeductible sales tax on the retail purchase of most products . <p> When all income , payroll , and sales taxes are taken into account , how much money does the typical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $10,000 automobile ? <p> First , of course , you must add Michigan 's 4% sales tax to the price of the automobile , so the automobile now costs $10,400 . <p> But to earn $10,400 in take-home pay , a worker will have to make $17,038 because the government will take an additional $6,638 from his paycheck in ( 1 ) state income tax , ( 2 ) payroll taxes , and ( 3 ) federal income taxes . For a breakdown of those taxes see the chart below . <p> Self-employed workers are keenly aware that they have taxes taken directly out of their incomes because they pay a self-employment tax , which is equal to the employer and the employee shares of FICA payroll taxes . The self-employment tax rate was 14.1% on 1991 earnings of up to $53,400 , which means , of course , that self-employed workers must earn an even greater amount of extra income to purchase a new $10,000 car . In fact , total earnings required to purchase the car in Michigan rise to $18,320 . <p> High- and Low-Tax States . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the states vary widely in the level and mixture of taxes they impose on their residents . The state with the highest sales and income taxes , California , charges an 8.25% sales tax on most items and imposes a 9.3% marginal income tax rate on middle-income workers , whereas Alaska and New Hampshire have neither a state income nor a sales tax . The chart below compares the amount of income a worker must earn to purchase a $10,000 car in eight jurisdictions with the highest taxes and the eight with the lowest taxes . It also shows the amount of taxes self-employed workers pay in those jurisdictions . <p> In California , a middle-income worker must earn an additional $18,776 to be able to purchase a $10,000 car . A self-employed worker in California must earn $20,186 to purchase the car . That consumer must earn more than double the sticker price of the car if all taxes are taken into account . In other words , in the high-tax states , self-employed consumers spend more of their income to pay taxes on the car than on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to avoid working and purchasing goods and services in high-tax states . For instance , to avoid high income taxes , businesses and workers tend to move from high-tax to low-tax states . That was clearly the case in the 1980s , for example , when low-income-tax states saw business and population growth , while high-income-tax states experienced little or no business and population growth . Moreover , to avoid high sales taxes , many consumers shop for major items in low-sales-tax states . For example , although Portland , Oregon , has a much smaller population than Seattle , Washington , Portland , which has no sales tax , has twice the annual retail sales of Seattle , which has an 8% sales tax . Other Goods <p> A $1,500 Computer . The retail price of a new IBM computer is roughly $1,500 . Using Michigan as the example , the income needed to purchase this computer after taking into account all taxes is $2,556 for a wage earner and $2,748 for a self-employed worker . <p> A Year 's Tuition . Many parents spend years sacrificing and saving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those parents are paying much more than they suspect . Although there is no sales tax on college tuition , the parents must pay income and payroll taxes on the money they use to send their children to college . To pay $8,000 in tuition , the parents must earn $13,107 if they are wage earners and $14,092 if they are self-employed . <p> A Year 's Supply of Gasoline . A typical car owner uses 504 gallons of gasoline a year , according to the Federal Highway Administration . The pre-tax price of that gasoline ( premium unleaded ) is $479 . Yet gasoline is different from most other products in that it is subject to special federal and state excise taxes in addition to normal sales taxes . The $1.29 per gallon pump prices includes those taxes . In a typical state , the combined federal and state gasoline tax is roughly 34 cents a gallon . The income needed to purchase the year 's supply of gasoline , after all taxes including the gasoline . <p> In high-tax states the true price of goods and services is about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you need to purchase an item , multiply its price tag by two . That is the rule of two on taxes . <p> In low-tax states the true price of goods and services , including all taxes , is closer to one and a half times the stated price . Thus , to figure how much additional income you need to earn to purchase an item , multiply its price tag by 1.5 .
