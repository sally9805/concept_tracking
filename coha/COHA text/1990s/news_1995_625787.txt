<p> Clyde Drexler has put up some amazing numbers lately . <p> He has been scoring , averaging 28.1 points over his past seven games . And Drexler has been rebounding , putting up a 10.3 average over those same seven games . <p> And he has been putting in a lot of time , playing more than 40 minutes in nine of the past 12 games ( and 38-plus in 11 of those 12 ) . <p> That includes 49 minutes in the Rockets ' 103-101 double-overtime loss to the Blazers on Sunday . <p> All those are impressive , but his assists have coach Rudy Tomjanovich singing Drexler 's praises . Drexler averages 5.3 assists , trailing only Charlotte 's Kendall Gill among the league 's shooting guards ( even though Gill technically plays point guard much of the time with Glen Rice in the backcourt ) . <p> " " With Clyde , the one thing people do n't talk about with this guy is his passing ability , " Tomjanovich said . " " I saw Danny Ainge the other day when he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people do n't understand how well this guy can pass . <p> " " We get layups in the half-court offense because guys cut and Clyde gives them the ball . <p> " " Portland was a different kind of team - a slashing team that did a lot of motion-type stuff , and the spacing was n't there . <p> But the way we do it , with Hakeem ( Olajuwon ) being in there and the 3-point shooters , those things ( passing ability ) are a little bit more obvious . " <p> Watching Drexler hit a cutting Kenny Smith , working the two-man game with Olajuwon or executing a perfect pick-and-roll with Chucky Brown makes Tomjanovich marvel even more about the total package Drexler brought to the Rockets when the deal was made last Feb. 14 with Portland that brought the hometown favorite back to Houston for Otis Thorpe . <p> " " We watched a lot of tapes on him , and when he sees a double team , he 's throwing the ball out , " Tomjanovich said . " " Usually , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I ca n't tell you how much I admire the guy and respect him . <p> He came in here in a very , very tough situation . It was almost a savior-like deal . He could only lose , almost . We understood that part of it . <p> " " But he 's the only guy in the whole league we could have made the trade for , " Tomjanovich said . <p> " " He 's the only guy that could have made it work because of his connection to Houston and his connection with Hakeem . And he was a guy who we knew the No. 1 focus was not climbing the ladder and becoming a star . He was already one of those . He wanted to win a championship . He had been close . <p> " " That made it a very tough situation because I do n't believe in shaking up your team unless you think it will make you better . " <p> And even though the Rockets went the hard way to win another title last spring - no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best records in the league - Tomjanovich thinks the 1994 title without Drexler was harder . <p> " " That first year we won it , that was probably the hardest coaching job because we had a hard time scoring , " he said . " " We never got anything real easy . <p> " " We always had to go through Hakeem , and he did a wonderful job . <p> " " Our outside people did a wonderful job too , but we could not get an easy basket unless we just ran . As a team , we were n't the greatest running ( and ) finishing team in the league . Our defense is what carried us . " <p> The pecking order - Just when the rent-a-refs figure out the superstars get the benefit of the doubt on close plays , they get replaced by the real guys . <p> But not soon enough for Utah 's Greg Foster , who was griping about the foul call that sent Olajuwon to the free-throw line with 54 seconds left in what would be a 103-100 Houston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rockets trailing 100-97 and less than a minute to play , referee James Capers ruled Olajuwon was fouled by Foster on a spinning shot in the lane . Olajuwon drilled the free throws , trimming the Utah lead to one point . <p> " " He 's Hakeem Olajuwon , and I 'm Greg Foster , " said Foster , showing an astounding grasp of the obvious . " " He 's going to get those calls , whether it 's replacement referees or the regular refs . I just ca n't believe they can take a game away from us like that . I ca n't believe it . It should have been a no-call . " Hey , Greg . Last time we checked , you guys were leading after the play , so quit crying . Besides , you 'll need to have those refs on your side when you get sent back to the Continental Basketball Association , so it 's best you hold your tongue . <p> Margin for error - Coach Rudy Tomjanovich on the Rockets ' mental attitude toward doing well in the regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good regular-season record ) is not as urgent as before , but I think they understand ( the importance ) . Who wants to go through that not having the home-court advantage ( in the playoffs ) ? That was just brutal what we had to go through ( last season ) and amazing how we got through it . <p> " " I think everybody would agree that it would be a lot better to have the extra game on our court . You have a little margin for error that way . If you do it the other way and you start losing those games ( at home ) , and they have the extra game there , it 's tough to overcome . " <p> Mario Elie agreed the home-court advantage will be extremely important this season . <p> " " We look at Chicago and Orlando and the records they have , " Elie said . " " We 're trying to keep up ( record-wise ) with those guys . The home court will be key this season because it 's so balanced now in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's a good thing to pay too much attention to what Chicago and Orlando are doing . " " We have to look at our situation , " Olajuwon said . " " If we take care of our own business , then we wo n't have to worry about anyone else . " <p> Statistical oddity - It 's probably not a first , but I 'd be willing to bet it 's been awhile since a team got baskets from opponents in consecutive games . <p> Friday night , Washington 's Jim McIlvaine blocked a Sam Cassell layup with 1:41 to play in the third quarter of the Rockets ' 113-107 victory . McIlvaine then accidentally tipped the ball in off the backboard , and Cassell was credited with the points . <p> Sunday , Portland 's Cliff Robinson contributed to the Rockets ' effort when he outjumped Clyde Drexler to tip in a missed Kenny Smith 3-pointer in the first quarter of the Rockets ' 103-101 double-overtime loss to the Blazers , with Drexler being the beneficiary . <p> Warm and fuzzy - Mario Elie said fans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bicker with each other on the court . <p> " " We have great chemistry out there , " he said . " " Even though we tend to bite each other 's heads off out there now and then . <p> But this team , in the locker room afterward , everyone 's happy . <p> We leave it out there on the court , that 's the good thing about this team . " <p> The last word - Apparently , nobody at ESPN bothered to check with Robert Horry when Craig Kilborn decided to start calling him " " Bobby " Horry on his " SportsCenter " telecasts , as in " " Bobby Horry bombing from way downtown ! " <p> Horry 's reaction ? " " Oh , I hate it . Nobody calls me Bobby . " <p> NOTES : Michael Murphy covers the Rockets and the NBA for the Chronicle . His Rockets Notebook appears on Tuesdays .
