IT 'S BEEN CALLED the " Hilton Head of the Heartland " and the " Golf Mecca of the Midwest , " but northern Michigan is both-and more . Its proper and deserving title is " America 's Summer Golf Capital , " but even that moniker does little to capture the excitement of the many first-rate daily-fee and resort courses sprinkled among the glacier-carved hills and valleys between Traverse City and Gaylord . The region , by the way , does not touch the Arctic Circle . It 's four hours ( or a short flight ) from Detroit . There is n't just quantity in Michigan 's north woods , there 's quality , too . Six area courses were voted to GOLF MAGAZINE 's " Top 100 You Can Play " list last month , including Treetops Sylvan ( Smith and Fazio courses ) , Lakewood Shores ( Gailes ) , High Pointe , Boyne Highlands ( Heather ) , and Grand Traverse ( The Bear ) . One of the region 's most venerable tests , The Legend at Shanty Creek , celebrates its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layout , with its sharp elevation changes , thick wooded areas , and spectacular views of Lake Bellaire , was one of the catalysts for the explosion of big-time designer courses in northern Michigan . A season-long activity of events ( including a $10,000 prize to anyone who scores a hole-in-one on the 12th hole , Monday to Thursday , through Aug. 29 ) is planned at the resort to celebrate a decade of the Legend . Not content to rest on its laurels , the fast-growing region , its summer climate tempered by cool breezes off Lake Michigan , has marched forward with several new projects intended to keep pace with demand . Among the prominent newcomers : BAY HARBOR GOLF CLUB . Shortly after the 1996 U.S. Open champion is crowned this month at Oakland Hills , the Midwest 's most anticipated new course will make its debut . Located west of Petoskey , this 27-hole golf/residential/marina development is perched on 140-foot bluffs overlooking Little Traverse Bay , an arm of Lake Michigan . Because nearly 2 1/2 miles of shoreline acreage has been dedicated to golf holes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beach of the Midwest . " Designed by Arthur Hills , the Links nine , with six holes propped up on bluffs overlooking the bay , will be the first to open . Three holes of the Quarry nine , due to open in September , are highlighted by dramatic elevation changes , giant escarpments , sedimentary rock outcrops , and sheer quarry walls . Six holes of the Preserve , the third nine , will be carved from a wilderness of hardwoods and will also be unveiled in the fall , with the balance of both nines to open next year . BOYNE HIGHLANDS . The first nine of the resort 's new Arthur Hills course debuted last fall , with the second nine due in 1997 . ( The new nine has been grafted to the resort 's Moor Course until next year ) . In addition to a giant pond on the 18th hole , the large-scale layout features expansive fairways , large greens , and sculptured target bunkers that serve as directional aids .

The rolling , wooded layout is distinguished by five picturesque water fountains as well as an impressive covered log bridge . BLACK BEAR . This 19-hole design , located eight miles north of Gaylord and scheduled to open Memorial Day weekend , greets arriving players with a 300-foot-long curtain of water at its entrance . The creative use of water features by architect Mark Sauger is a flashy departure from the usual northern Michigan design motifs . The 19th hole is a charming par-three warmup ( or wage-settler ) . CROOKED TREE . Occupying a former hilltop farm within sight of Bay Harbor , Crooked Tree , opened last July , is an old-style track built around a cedar swamp and 45-acre wetland . Thirteen holes feature stellar views of Little Traverse Bay . Wind is often a factor . A shotmaker 's delight .
