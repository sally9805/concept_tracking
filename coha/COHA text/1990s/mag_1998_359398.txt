As Jim Moran sat at home with his wife on Monday night , he wondered what to do about two of their children , ages seven and nine . Bill Clinton was moments away from delivering a televised address to the nation , and Moran , a Democratic Congressman from Virginia , " did n't want to say to the kids , ' You have to leave the room  --  the President 's coming on . ' " <P> The kids , as it turns out , may have been less troubled than their dad by what they saw . " This whole sordid mess is just too tawdry and tedious and embarrassing , " said Moran on the morning after , his voice a subdued monotone . " It 's like a novel that just became too full of juicy parts and bizarre , sleazy characters . " Characters like Bill Clinton , the leader of Moran 's party , the President he had followed loyally for six years ? " I guess part of this is finding out that everyone is far more human than we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I guess there are no real heroes . " <P> If Moran 's reaction was disturbing , what Clinton heard from some other Democrats in Congress was even worse . Dianne Feinstein , the highly regarded Senator from California , recalled how she believed Clinton back in January when he denied having had a sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky . With the President 's change of story , she said , " my trust in his credibility has been badly shattered . " Paul McHale , a retiring third-term Democratic Congressman from Pennsylvania 's Lehigh Valley , went even further . Declaring that the President " lied under oath " and " almost certainly " encouraged Lewinsky to keep silent , McHale bluntly called on Clinton to " resign or face impeachment . " <P> It 's one thing for Republicans to call for Clinton 's resignation . ( Some , like conservative presidential aspirant Senator John Ashcroft , did so quickly , and predictably . ) But congressional Democrats form the President 's outermost  --  and most important  --  ring of defense against his enemies . Which is why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apologies to more than a dozen Democratic lawmakers on Tuesday . For the most part , those Democrats who said anything at all in public stuck to White House-inspired spin , expressing " disappointment " in the President , but satisfaction that he had taken responsibility for his actions , and a strong desire to see Starr 's investigation come to an end . In private , however , Democrats were saying that the President 's hold on his party has never been so fragile . " We stood by this guy for seven months while he lied to us , " complained one bitter House Democrat . " Now we 're supposed to happily keep defending him ? I do n't think so . " <P> Neither did the party 's congressional leaders , most of whom were conspicuous in their absence from the airwaves in the aftermath of Clinton 's speech . ( In a stroke of luck for the President , Congress is on summer recess , its members dispersed across the country and the world . ) House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt , celebrating his 32nd anniversary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dispatch a satellite truck so he could appear on Larry King Live . His Senate counterpart , Tom Daschle , was spending the week cruising around his home state of South Dakota , alone and , as one aide emphasized , " out of cell-phone range . " Cornered at an event in Sioux Falls on Tuesday , Daschle admitted he was " disappointed in not being told the truth " when the President denied the affair . But , he said , " it 's time we get on with it . "
