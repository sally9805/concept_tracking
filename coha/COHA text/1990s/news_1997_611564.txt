<p> Rebecca Erin Lilly , the Takoma Park teenager whose battle against brain cancer has been chronicled in The Washington Post 's Health section , died peacefully at home early yesterday . She was less than four weeks from her 17th birthday . <p> Becca Lilly died with her family at the bedside : her parents , Joe and Maureen Lilly , and siblings Anne Marie , 20 , and Joe Jr. , 14 . Her 5-year-old sister , Sarah , was asleep . The family woke her and later brought her into the room to say goodbye . <p> After Becca 's fitful breathing stopped about 2:30 a.m. , the Lillys stayed with her awhile and held her hands and quietly cried . Then Joe Jr . went to find candles , and the priest was called . <p> Becca 's six-year fight against a malignant brain tumor exemplifies the promise and limits of state-of-the-art medicine . <p> She underwent every major form of cancer treatment  --  five brain surgeries , two kinds of radiation and four combinations of chemotherapy . In November 1995 , during a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first child to undergo gene therapy for a brain tumor . <p> All the medical firepower doctors could bring against Becca 's tumor was not enough to save her life . Early this month , when her symptoms overwhelmed her and a brain scan showed the tumor growing out of control , Becca 's family decided to forgo further medical treatment and concentrate all effort on keeping her at home and free of pain . <p> Tuesday evening , hospice nurse Sue Eynon Lark spoke to the Lillys in a little room off the kitchen and told them Becca probably would not make it until morning . Her blood pressure was falling , and her heart was racing in an effort to compensate . Her pulse was between 190 and 200 beats a minute , almost too fast to count . Her right lung had filled with fluid , and her breathing became more rapid and more shallow . <p> Becca was wearing her pink Cape May whale watch T-shirt , slit down the back like a hospital gown . A toy moose and a box of tissues lay on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balloons . <p> Becca appeared " very comfortable , " the nurse said , but she raised the morphine level another notch to try to keep the lungs and heart from fighting quite so hard . <p> It was difficult to tell anymore how conscious Becca was . Her eyes were half-open and unfocused , and she no longer moved except to breathe . <p> Earlier in the day , Joe and Maureen Lilly had bent close over her , one on each side of the bed . Joe Lilly spoke slow and loud to her , almost directly into her right ear . <p> " Becca , if you can see Mom , blink your eyes . " <p> Nothing . <p> " Becca , do you want people to come see you ? If you do , blink . " <p> She blinked . <p> " Good girl , Bec , " said her mom . <p> " I know it 's scary when you ca n't see things , " Joe Lilly continued , " but we 'll talk to you and tell you who 's here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relax . <p> " When you get to Heaven , all that changes . " <p> Around midnight , with Becca still holding on , the rest of the family tried to sleep : Joe and Maureen Lilly on a futon next to Becca 's bed , Joe Jr . in a sleeping bag on the living room floor , Anne Marie and Sarah upstairs . Meanwhile , Becca 's aunt Bonnie Logan and a friend kept watch over Becca , under orders to wake everyone if the gaps in her breathing widened . <p> Coming Home <p> " What Rebecca showed us is that you ca n't measure our lives in terms of the number of years we live , " said Martin Lustick , a pediatrician with Kaiser Permanente , the Lillys ' health plan . " To see a 16-year-old confront the ultimate with such amazing grace makes you realize that it 's completely unrelated to how long people live . " <p> " You gain from just being around someone like Rebecca , " said neurologist Roger J. Packer , who directs the brain tumor program at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . " She and her family help you understand how important life is and what true quality of life means . " <p> Packer praised the Lilly family 's courage in trying new treatments as long as they offered hope  --  and in ultimately pulling back from all-out medical treatment " to avoid needlessly hurting her . " <p> Less than four weeks ago , Becca was at Walt Disney World in Florida , where she toured the Magic Kingdom and rode the Splash Mountain spillway . But by the time the Lillys returned from Florida , she was falling sick with severe headaches , nausea , double vision and weakness on her right side . Her doctors said the tumor had progressed beyond their ability to treat it . <p> After a brief hospitalization , Becca went home . She spent her last days in a hospital bed in her sister 's old room on the ground floor of the Lillys ' home , surrounded by balloons , flowers and her vast collection of stuffed animals . Her family handled most of her care , with help from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Metropolitan Washington . <p> Father 's Day afternoon , Joe Lilly lifted his daughter out of bed and carried her into the living room , where she sat leaning back on the sofa for a couple of hours , as family and friends looked at snapshots of the recent Disney World trip . But in the last week , she did not leave her room . <p> Two nights before Becca died , hospice social worker Barbara Psotka asked 5-year-old Sarah what she would tell other children going through a similar experience . <p> " If somebody 's sick , " Sarah replied , " you should let your mom and dad be by theirselves so they can work with the kid who is sick , like my sister , Becca , who has cancer . She is probably going to die . If your sister is sick , you should leave them alone ; they might be tired . Also , if someone is sick you should tell them you love them because it makes them happy and feel better . And if they die , you might never see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make them smile . When Becca 's sick lots of people come to see her because they want to say hello and they want to say goodbye . " <p> Although Becca drifted in and out of wakefulness during the last week , she occasionally surprised visitors , letting them know she was listening by a nod , a smile , a wave of her left hand or a characteristic wince at one of her father 's jokes . When she could no longer swallow pills , a battery-powered pump dripped painkilling morphine continuously into her bloodstream through a catheter . The dose could be momentarily boosted by the press of a button if she seemed distressed . <p> Gradually , she became less alert and her breathing more labored . She did n't eat or drink . She began to go into heart failure . Still , she hung on for a few more days . Over the weekend , she dozed but would not sleep . <p> " We do n't know , " Maureen Lilly said . " Maybe the tumor . Maybe drugs . Maybe she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> ' A Quiet Strength ' <p> Becca 's tumor , a malignant glioblastoma , was diagnosed six years ago this month , when she was finishing fifth grade . In both children and adults , glioblastomas are the most aggressive of brain tumors . Of children diagnosed with a glioblastoma , only one in five is alive three years later . <p> Despite her disease and its dire prognosis , Becca kept up a teenager 's pace . <p> " Becca never let her illness  --  or our treatments  --  slow her down , " said Peter C. Adamson , a pediatric oncologist at the National Cancer Institute . " She could be very sick one moment and a couple of days later be back getting on with her life . I do n't know many adults  --  I 'll include myself  --  who could do that . " <p> One of the most difficult things for families facing a life-threatening illness , Adamson said , is to understand that doctors do n't have all the answers . He lauded the Lillys for accepting as well as parents could " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about brain tumors , even as they pursued every possible means of prolonging their daughter 's life . <p> Adamson visited Becca at home last week and spoke with her  --  as he had about six weeks ago  --  about the seriousness of her condition and the lack of any medical treatment to stop the tumor . He asked her once again if she had any questions about what was happening , and she said she had none . <p> " I really got the sense that she was at peace , as best one can be , " he said Friday . <p> About 10 days ago , worried that they might somehow be misinterpreting Becca 's outward calm , Maureen Lilly asked her directly , " Are you afraid ? " Becca said no . <p> Becca received Holy Communion daily . Because she had trouble swallowing , she could not take the wafer , but Joe Lilly squirted a sip of wine  --  diluted with holy water  --  into her mouth through a plastic syringe . Each evening , the Lilly family gathered around Becca 's bed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sometimes Becca 's lips moved with the words . <p> Hail Mary , full of grace , the Lord is with thee . . . <p> After a fierce thunderstorm knocked out electrical power one evening last week , the Lillys read scriptural passages to Becca by flashlight . <p> " Becca had a quiet strength , " said Karen Olson , a nurse on Children 's Hospital 's neurosurgery unit , 4 Green , where Becca was hospitalized eight times in the last year and a half . " What amazed me was how she always worried about the people around her  --  her mom and dad and her brother and sisters , and the other kids on the unit . " <p> In response to a series of articles on Becca over the last 15 months , hundreds of Post readers sent her cards , letters , poems and prayers . Preschoolers colored for her . A Bethesda man gave her the Bronze Star he had been awarded during World War II . Former first lady Nancy Reagan mailed a jar of jelly beans . <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to know that you are my hero , " Ed Burwitz , of Stafford , Va. , wrote Becca last week . " You are the most courageous person that I have ever known . " <p> Becca seemed unfazed by such attention or by her harrowing treatments . Through it all , what she wished for most was to be an ordinary teenager . She rarely talked about her cancer , even to her closest friends and family . <p> She was a kid who loved hats , bears , dancing , a dog named Lady , angels , London broil , fried shrimp and basketball . She was turned off by loudmouths , people who are full of themselves , a purple dinosaur named Barney , bad basketball referees and bad hair . <p> Becca completed her junior year at Good Counsel High School in Wheaton last month and was awarded a class ring . She had cut back to half the normal course load last fall , as increasing troubles with language and memory made schoolwork difficult . Her favorite class was a special project three mornings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where she helped out with a class of 4-year-olds , whom she referred to as " my kids . " <p> A competitive athlete in an athletic family , Becca played soccer , softball and , especially , basketball . Even this past winter , when her tumor was robbing her of stamina and peripheral vision , she played on a Catholic Youth Organization basketball team . <p> Five summers in a row , she attended Camp Fantastic , a camp for youngsters with cancer near Front Royal , Va . <p> Gene Therapy Pioneer <p> Most of Becca 's medical treatment was at Children 's Hospital , Georgetown University Hospital and the Clinical Center at the National Institutes of Health . After her tumor was diagnosed in 1991 , she was treated with surgery and radiation  --  standard therapy for glioblastomas  --  in 1991 and again in 1994 , when the tumor recurred . In the fall of 1995 , when the tumor grew back again , standard medicine had nothing more to offer her , and she became the first child treated with gene therapy for brain cancer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an effort to treat illness by altering the genes inside a patient 's cells . It offers doctors the tantalizing hope of treating not merely the results of a disease , as current cancer therapies do , but its root cause . <p> In Becca 's case , that meant trying to trick the tumor into committing cellular suicide . After removing as much tumor as possible , surgeons injected into her brain a harmless virus carrying a gene designed to make the tumor more sensitive to a follow-up drug . If it worked , the virus would act as a kind of " taxicab " for the gene , transporting it inside the tumor cells , which would then become vulnerable to the drug . <p> Becca 's tumor grew back six months after her gene therapy . What effect , if any , the gene therapy had on her tumor is unclear and will remain so until more patients can be studied and compared . At the least , Becca 's case helped show that the initial dose was safe and nontoxic  --  allowing doctors to boost the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lull in tumor growth was significant , neurologist Packer said , even though gene therapy could n't cure her disease . <p> " It did n't work for Rebecca , but that does n't mean it ca n't work for other children , if we get smarter , " Packer said . " The only thing we can do is to continue to battle and find more things to battle cancer with . " <p> Becca was also among the first children treated with several promising combinations of anti-cancer drugs in the earliest stages of testing in humans . <p> In considering whether to participate in such tests , known as clinical trials , families often have to make agonizing choices between alternatives with long odds . On the basis of sparse data and sometimes conflicting results , they must weigh hope against fear and likely effect against likely side effect . <p> The quality of Becca 's life was the Lillys ' touchstone as they made such decisions . Becca participated in their discussions , and she signed the medical consent forms before her pioneering gene therapy operation and subsequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close friend and Good Counsel classmate Megan McArdle sat by her bed for a while . Megan read aloud a letter she had written to Becca . <p> " I told her I loved her , and she squeezed my hand , " Megan said .

Traber , of Riverdale , and her paternal grandmother , Nancy M. Lilly , of Washington . <p> * FUNERAL ARRANGEMENTS <p> A public viewing will be held from 5 to 9 p.m. today and from 7 to 9 p.m. tomorrow at the Rafferty Center , Good Counsel High School , 11601 Georgia Ave. , Wheaton . <p> The Mass of Christian Burial will be at 10 a.m .
