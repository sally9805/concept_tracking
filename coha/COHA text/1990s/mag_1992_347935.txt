FIRST HE TRIED PERSUASION . THEN HE OFFERED COMpromise . When that did n't work , Boris Yeltsin declared war . And that finally led to compromise . After eight days of haggling with Russia 's supreme legislature , Russia 's first democratically elected leader took the podium on Thursday and proceeded to heap buckets of scorn upon the Congress of People 's Deputies , a legislature populated with Soviet holdovers . Their simmering feud had finally boiled over . He blasted the body for " blocking reform , " for orchestrating a " creeping coup . " He accused Deputies of defiling the Kremlin meeting hall with " the sick ambitions of failed politicians . " Then he called for a referendum to end the political stalemate . " I am asking the citizens of Russia to make it clear , " he said , addressing the electorate . " Which side are you on ? " <P> Yeltsin was furious at the Congress for refusing to confirm acting Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar , his handpicked architect of reform . When confronted with a stark choice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the balky Deputies under leader Ruslan Khasbulatov became more inclined to deal . So , on reflection , did Yeltsin . By week 's end he had agreed to submit three candidates for Prime Minister and modified his referendum . Although a popular vote would still be Yeltsin 's to lose , Russians will not be asked to choose directly between him and the Congress . Instead , they will determine who should have more power by voting on a new constitution on April 11.
