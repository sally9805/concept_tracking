The first entry in Leslie Stewart 's diary read : Dear Diary : This morning I met the man I am going to marry . It was a simple , optimistic statement , with not the slightest portent of the dramatic chain of events that was about to occur . It was one of those rare , serendipitous days when nothing could go wrong , when nothing would dare go wrong . Leslie Stewart had no interest in astrology , but that morning , as she was leafing through the Lexington Herald-Leader , a horoscope in an astrology column by Zoltaire caught her eye . It read : For Leo ( July 23rd to August 22nd ) . The new moon illuminates your love life . You are in your lunar cycle high now , and must pay close attention to an exciting new event in your life . Your compatible sign is Virgo . Today will be a red letter day . Be prepared to enjoy it . Be prepared to enjoy what ? Leslie thought wryly . Today was going to be like every other day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leslie Stewart was a public relations and advertising executive at the Lexington , Kentucky , firm of Bailey &; Tomkins . She had three meetings scheduled for that afternoon , the first with the Kentucky Fertilizer Company , whose executives were excited about the new campaign she was working up for them . They especially liked its beginning : " If you want to smell the roses .... " The second meeting was with the Breeders Stud Farm , and the third with the Lexington Coal Company . Red letter day ? In her late twenties , with a slim , provocative figure , Leslie Stewart had an exciting , exotic look ; gray , sloe eyes , high cheekbones , and soft , honey-colored hair , which she wore long and elegantly simple . A friend of Leslie 's had once told her , " If you 're beautiful and have a brain and a vagina , you can own the world . " Leslie Stewart was beautiful and had an IQ of 170 , and nature had taken care of the rest . But she found her looks a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but few of them bothered to try really to get to know her . Aside from the two secretaries who worked at Bailey &; Tomkins , Leslie was the only woman there . There were fifteen male employees . It had taken Leslie less than a week to learn that she was more intelligent than any of them . It was a discovery she decided to keep to herself . In the beginning , both partners , Jim Bailey , an overweight , soft-spoken man in his forties , and Al Tomkins , anorexic and hyper , ten years younger than Bailey , individually tried to talk Leslie into going to bed with them . She had stopped them very simply . " Ask me once more , and I 'll quit . " That had put an end to that . Leslie was too valuable an employee to lose . Her first week on the job , during a coffee break , Leslie had told her fellow employees a joke . " Three men came across a female genie who promised to grant each one a wish . The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smarter . ' The genie blinked , and the man said , ' Hey , I feel smarter already . ' " The second man said , ' I wish I were fifty percent smarter . ' The genie blinked , and the man exclaimed , ' That 's wonderful ! I think I know things now that I did n't know before . ' " The third man said , ' I 'd like to be one hundred percent smarter . ' " So the genie blinked , and the man changed into a woman . " Leslie looked expectantly at the men at the table . They were all staring at her , unamused . Point taken . The red-letter day that the astrologer had promised began at eleven o'clock that morning . Jim Bailey walked into Leslie 's tiny , cramped office . " We have a new client , " he announced . " I want you to take charge . " She was already handling more accounts than anyone else at the firm , but she knew better than to protest . " Fine , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's not a what , it 's a who . You 've heard of Oliver Russell , of course ? " Everyone had heard of Oliver Russell . A local attorney and candidate for governor , he had his face on billboards all over Kentucky . With his brilliant legal record , he was considered , at thirty-five , the most eligible bachelor in the state . He was on all the talk shows on the major television stations in Lexington -- WDKY , WTVQ , WKYT -- and on the popular local radio stations , WKQQ and WLRO . Strikingly handsome , with black , unruly hair , dark eyes , an athletic build , and a warm smile , he had the reputation of having slept with most of the ladies in Lexington . " Yes , I 've heard of him . What are we going to do for him ? " " We 're going to try to help turn him into the governor of Kentucky . He 's on his way here now . " Oliver Russell arrived a few minutes later . He was even more attractive in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Leslie , he smiled warmly . " I 've heard a lot about you . I 'm so glad you 're going to handle my campaign . " He was not at all what Leslie had expected . There was a completely disarming sincerity about the man . For a moment , Leslie was at a loss for words . " I -- thank you . Please sit down . " Oliver Russell took a seat . " Let 's start at the beginning , " Leslie suggested . " Why are you running for governor ? " " It 's very simple . Kentucky 's a wonderful state . We know it is , because we live here , and we 're able to enjoy its magic -- but much of the country thinks of us as a bunch of hillbillies . I want to change that image . Kentucky has more to ' offer than a dozen other states combined . The history of this country began here . We have one of the oldest capitol buildings in America . Kentucky gave this country two presidents . It 's the land of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have the most beautiful scenery in the world -- exciting caves , rivers , bluegrass fields -- everything . I want to open all that up to the rest of the world . " He spoke with a deep conviction , and Leslie found herself strongly drawn to him . She thought of the astrology column . " The new moon illuminates your love life . Today will be a red letter day . Be prepared to enjoy it . " Oliver Russell was saying , " The campaign wo n't work unless you believe in this as strongly as I do . " " I do , " Leslie said quickly . Too quickly ? " I 'm really looking forward to this . " She hesitated a moment . " May I ask you a question ? " " Certainly . " " What 's your birth sign ? " " Virgo . " After Oliver Russell left , Leslie went into Jim Bailey 's office . " I like him , " she said . " He 's sincere . He really cares . I think he 'd make a fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's not going to be easy . " She looked at him , puzzled . " Oh ? Why ? " ' Bailey shrugged . " I 'm not sure . There 's something going on that I ca n't explain . You 've seen Russell on all the billboards and on television ? " " Yes . " " Well , that 's stopped . " " I do n't understand . Why ? " " No one knows for certain , but there are a lot of strange rumors . One of the rumors is that someone was backing Russell , putting up all the money for his campaign , and then for some reason suddenly dropped him . " " In the middle of a campaign he was winning ? That does n't make sense , Jim . " " I know . " " Why did he come to us ? " " He really wants this . I think he 's ambitious . And he feels he can make a difference . He would like us to figure out a campaign that wo n't cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to buy any more airtime or do much advertising . All we can really do for him is to arrange interviews , plant newspaper articles , that sort of thing . " He shook his head . " Governor Addison is spending a fortune on his campaign . In the last two weeks , Russell 's gone way down in the polls . It 's a shame . He 's a good lawyer . Does a lot of pro bono work . I think he 'd make a good governor , too . " That night Leslie made her first note in her new diary . Dear Diary : This morning I met the man I am going to marry . Leslie Stewart 's early childhood was idyllic . She was an extraordinarily intelligent child . Her father was an English professor at Lexington Community College and her mother was a housewife . Leslie 's father was a handsome man , patrician and intellectual . He was a caring father , and he saw to it that the family took their vacations together and traveled together . Her father adored her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would say . He would tell her how beautiful she looked and compliment her on her grades , her behavior , her friends . Leslie could do no wrong in his eyes . For her ninth birthday , her father bought her a beautiful brown velvet dress with lace cuffs . He would have her put the dress on , and he would show her off to his friends when they came to dinner . " Is n't she a beauty ? " he would say . Leslie worshiped him . One morning , a year later , in a split second , Leslie 's wonderful life vanished . Her mother , face stained with tears , sat her down . " Darling , your father has ... left us . " Leslie did not understand at first . " When will he be back ? " " He 's not coming back . " And each word was a sharp knife . My mother has driven him away , Leslie thought . She felt sorry for her mother because now there would be a divorce and a custody fight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 'll come for me , Leslie told herself . But weeks passed , and her father never called . They wo n't let him come and see me , Leslie decided . Mother 's punishing him . It was Leslie 's elderly aunt who explained to the child that there would be no custody battle . Leslie 's father had fallen in love with a widow who taught at the university and had moved in with her , in her house on Limestone Street . One day when they were out shopping , Leslie 's mother pointed out the house . " That 's where they live , " she said bitterly . Leslie resolved to visit her father . When he sees me , she thought , he 'll want to come home . On a Friday , after school , Leslie went to the house on Limestone Street and rang the doorbell . The door was opened by a girl Leslie 's age . She was wearing a brown velvet dress with lace cuffs . Leslie stared at her , in shock . The little girl was looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leslie fled . Over the next year , Leslie watched her mother retire into herself . She had lost all interest in life . Leslie had believed that " dying of a broken heart " was an empty phrase , but Leslie helplessly watched her mother fade away and die , and when people asked her what her mother had died of , Leslie answered , " She died of a broken heart . " And Leslie resolved that no man would ever do that to her . After her mother 's death , Leslie moved in with her aunt . Leslie attended Bryan Station High School and was graduated from the University of Kentucky summa cum laude . In her final year in college , she was voted beauty queen , and turned down numerous offers from modeling agencies . Leslie had two brief affairs , one with a college football hero , and the other with her economics professor . They quickly bored her . The fact was that she was brighter than both of them . Just before Leslie was graduated , her aunt died . Leslie finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public relations agency of Bailey &; Tomkins . Its offices were on Vine Street in a U-shaped brick building with a copper roof and a fountain in the courtyard . Jim Bailey , the senior partner , had examined Leslie 's resume , and nodded . " Very impressive . You 're in luck . We need a secretary . " " A secretary ? I hoped --  " " Yes ? " " Nothing . " Leslie started as a secretary , taking notes at all the meetings , her mind all the while judging and thinking of ways to improve the advertising campaigns that were being suggested . One morning , an account executive was saying , " I 've thought of the perfect logo for the Rancho Beef Chili account . On the label of the can , we show a picture of a cowboy roping a cow . It suggests that the beef is fresh , and --  " That 's a terrible idea , Leslie thought . They were all staring at her , and to her horror , Leslie realized she had spoken aloud . " Would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ... " She wished she were somewhere else . Anywhere . They were all waiting . Leslie took a deep breath . " When people eat meat , they do n't want to be reminded that they 're eating a dead animal . " There was a heavy silence . Jim Bailey cleared his throat . " Maybe we should give this a little more thought . " The following week , during a meeting on how to publicize a new beauty soap account , one of the executives said , " We 'll use beauty contest winners . " " Excuse me , " Leslie said diffidently . " I believe that 's been done . Why could n't we use lovely flight attendants from around the world to show that our beauty soap is universal ? " In the meetings after that , the men found themselves turning to Leslie for her opinion . A year later , she was a junior copywriter , and two years after that , she became an account executive , handling both advertising and publicity . Oliver Russell was the first real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks after Oliver Russell came to them , Bailey suggested to Leslie that it might be better to drop him , because he could not afford to pay their usual agency fee , but Leslie persuaded him to keep the account . " Call it pro bono , " she said . Bailey studied her a moment . " Right . " Leslie and Oliver Russell were seated on a bench in Triangle Park . It was a cool fall day , with a soft breeze coming from the lake . " I hate politics , " Oliver Russell said . Leslie looked at him in surprise . " Then why in the world are you --  ? " " Because I want to change the system , Leslie . It 's been taken over by lobbyists and corporations that help put the wrong people in power and then control them . There are a lot of things I want to do . " His voice was filled with passion . " The people who are running the country have turned it into an old boys ' club . They care more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not right , and I 'm going to try to correct that . " Leslie listened as Oliver went on , and she was thinking , He could do it . There was such a compelling excitement about him . The truth was that she found everything about him exciting . She had never felt this way about a man before , and it was an exhilarating experience . She had no way of knowing how he felt about her . He is always the perfect gentleman , damn him . It seemed to Leslie that every few minutes people were coming up to the park bench to shake Oliver 's hand and to wish him well . The women were visually throwing daggers at Leslie . They 've probably all been out with him , Leslie thought . They 've probably all been to bed with him . Well , that 's none of my business . She had heard that until recently he had been dating the daughter of a senator . She wondered what had happened . That 's none of my business , either . ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's campaign was going badly . Without money to pay his staff , and no television , radio , or newspaper ads , it was impossible to compete with Governor Cary Addison , whose image seemed to be everywhere . Leslie arranged for Oliver to appear at company picnics , at factories , and at dozens of social events , but she knew these appearances were all minor-league , and it frustrated her . " Have you seen the latest polls ? " Jim Bailey asked Leslie . " Your boy is going down the tubes . " Not if I can help it , Leslie thought . Leslie and Oliver were having dinner at Cheznous . " It 's not working , is it ? " Oliver asked quietly . " here 's still plenty of time , " Leslie said reassuringly . " When the voters get to know you --  " Oliver shook his head . " I read the polls , too . I want you to know I appreciate everything you 've tried to do for me , Leslie . You 've been great . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , He 's the most wonderful man I 've ever met , and I ca n't help him . She wanted to take him in her arms and hold him and console him . Console him ? Who am I kidding ? As they got up to leave , a man , a woman , and two small girls approached the table . " Oliver ! How are you ? " The speaker was in his forties , an attractive-looking man with a black eye patch that gave him the raffish look of an amiable pirate . Oliver rose and held out his hand . " Hello , Peter . I 'd like you to meet Leslie Stewart . Peter Tager . " " Hello , Leslie . " Tager nodded toward his family . " This is my wife , Betsy , and this is Elizabeth and this is Rebecca . " There was enormous pride in his voice . Peter Tager turned to Oliver . " I 'm awfully sorry about what happened . It 's a damned shame . I hated to do it , but I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " If there was anything I could have done --  " " It does n't matter . I 'm fine . " " You know I wish you only the best of luck . " On the way home , Leslie asked , " What was that all about ? " Oliver started to say something , then stopped . " It 's not important . " Leslie lived in a neat one-bedroom apartment in the Brandywine section of Lexington . As they approached the building , Oliver said hesitantly , " Leslie , I know that your agency is handling me for almost nothing , but frankly , I think you 're wasting your time . It might be better if I just quit now . " " No , " she said , and the intensity of her voice surprised her . " You ca n't quit . We 'll find a way to make it work . " Oliver turned to look at her . " You really care , do n't you ? " Am I reading too much into that question ? " Yes , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When they arrived at her apartment , Leslie took a deep breath . " Would you like to come in ? " He looked at her a long time . " Yes . " Afterward , she never knew who made the first move . All she remembered was that they were undressing each other and she was in his arms and there was a wild , feral haste in their lovemaking , and after that , a slow and easy melting , in a rhythm that was timeless and ecstatic . It was the most wonderful feeling Leslie had ever experienced . They were together the whole night , and it was magical . Oliver was insatiable , giving and demanding at the same time , and he went on forever . He was an animal . And Leslie thought , Oh , my God , I 'm one , too . In the morning , over a breakfast of orange juice , scrambled eggs , toast , and bacon , Leslie said , " There 's going to be a picnic at Green River Lake on Friday , Oliver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll arrange for you to make a speech . We 'll buy radio time to let everyone know you 're going to be there . Then we'll --  " " Leslie , " he protested , " I have n't the money to do that . " " Oh , do n't worry about that , " she said airily . " The agency will pay for it . " She knew that there was not the remotest chance that the agency would pay for it . She intended to do that herself . She would tell Jim Bailey that the money had been donated by a Russell supporter . And it would be the truth . Ill do anything in the world to help him , she thought . There were two hundred people at the picnic at Green River Lake , and when Oliver addressed the crowd , he was brilliant . " Half the people in this country do n't vote , " he told them . " We have the lowest voting record of any industrial country in the world -- less than fifty percent . If you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure they do change . It 's more than a responsibility , it 's a privilege . There 's an election coming up soon . Whether you vote for me or my opponent , vote . Be there . " They cheered him . Leslie arranged for Oliver to appear at as many functions as possible . He presided at the opening of a children 's clinic , dedicated a bridge , talked to women 's groups , labor groups , at charity events , and retirement homes . Still , he kept slipping in the polls . Whenever Oliver was not campaigning , he and Leslie found some time to be together . They went riding in a horse-drawn carriage through Triangle Park , spent a Saturday afternoon at the Antique Market , and had dinner at A la Lucie . Oliver gave Leslie flowers for Groundhog Day and on the anniversary of the Battle of Bull Run , and left loving messages on her answering machine : " Darling -- where are you ? I miss you , miss you , miss you . " " I 'm madly in love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how sexy it sounds ? " " I think it must be illegal to be this happy . I love you . " It did n't matter to Leslie where she and Oliver went : She just wanted to be with him . One of the most exciting things they did was to go whitewater rafting on the Russell Fork River one Sunday . The trip started innocently , gently , until the river began to pound its way around the base of the mountains in a giant loop that began a series of deafening , breathtaking vertical drops in the rapids : five feet ... eight feet ... nine feet ... only a terrifying raft length apart . The trip took three and a half hours , and when Leslie and Oliver got off the raft , they were soaking wet and glad to be alive . They could not keep their hands off each other . They made love in their cabin , in the back of his automobile , in the woods . One early fall evening , Oliver prepared dinner at his home , a charming house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were grilled flank steaks marinated in soy sauce , garlic , and herbs , served with baked potato , salad , and a perfect red wine . " You 're a wonderful cook , " Leslie told him . She snuggled up to him . " In fact , you 're a wonderful everything , sweetheart . " " Thank you , my love . " He remembered something . " I have a little surprise for you that I want you to try . " He disappeared into the bedroom for a moment and came out carrying a small bottle with a clear liquid inside . " Here it is , " he said . " What is it ? " " Have you heard of Ecstasy ? " " Heard of it ? I 'm in it . " " I mean the drug Ecstasy . This is liquid Ecstasy . It 's supposed to be a great aphrodisiac . " Leslie frowned . " Darling -- you do n't need that . We do n't need it . It could be dangerous . " She hesitated . " Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter of fact , I do n't . Take that look off your face . A friend of mine gave me this and told me to try it . This would have been the first time . " " Let 's not have a first time , " Leslie said . " Will you throw it away ? " " You 're right . Of course I will . " He went into the bathroom , and a moment later Leslie heard the toilet flush . Oliver reappeared . " All gone . " He grinned . " Who needs Ecstasy in a bottle ? I have it in a better package . " And he took her in his arms . Leslie had read the love stories and had heard the love songs , but nothing had prepared her for the incredible reality . She had always thought that romantic lyrics were sentimental nonsense , wishful dreaming . She knew better now . The world suddenly seemed brighter , more beautiful . Everything was touched with magic , and the magic was Oliver Russell . One Saturday morning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , enjoying the spectacular scenery that surrounded them . " I 've never been on this trail before , " Leslie said . " I think you 're going to enjoy it . " They were approaching a sharp curve in the path . As they rounded it , Leslie stopped , stunned . In the middle of the path was a hand-painted wooden sign : LESLIE , WILL YOU MARRY ME ? Leslie 's heart began to beat faster . She turned to Oliver , speechless . He took her in his arms . " Will you ? " How did I get so lucky ? Leslie wondered . She hugged him tightly and whispered , " Yes , darling . Of course I will . " " I 'm afraid I ca n't promise you that you 're going to marry governor , but I 'm a pretty good attorney . " She snuggled up to him and whispered , " That will do nicely . " ... A few nights later , Leslie was getting dressed to meet Oliver for dinner when he telephoned . " Darling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have to go to a meeting tonight , and I 'll have to cancel our dinner . Will you forgive me ? " Leslie smiled and said softly , " You 're forgiven . " The following day , Leslie picked up a copy of the State Journal . The headline read : WOMAN 'S BODY FOUND IN KENTUCKY RIVER . The story went on : " Early this morning , the body of a nude woman who appeared to be in her early twenties was found by police in the Kentucky River ten miles east of Lexington . An autopsy is being performed to determine the cause of death .... " Leslie shuddered as she read the story . To die so young Did she have a lover ? A husband ? How thankful I am to be alive and so happy and so loved . It seemed that all of Lexington was talking about the forthcoming wedding . Lexington was a small town , and Oliver Russell was a popular figure . They were a spectacular-looking couple , Oliver dark and handsome , and Leslie with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had spread like wildfire . " I hope he knows how lucky he is , " Jim Bailey said . Leslie smiled . " We 're both lucky . " " Are you going to elope ? " " No . Oliver wants to have a formal wedding . We 're getting married at the Calvary Chapel church . " " When does the happy event take place ? " " In six weeks . " A few days later , a story on the front page of the State Journal read : " An autopsy has revealed that the woman found in the Kentucky River , identified as Lisa Burnette , a legal secretary , died of an overdose of a dangerous illegal drug known on the streets as liquid Ecstasy .... " Liquid Ecstasy . Leslie recalled the evening with Oliver . And she thought , How lucky it was that he threw that bottle away . The next few weeks were filled with frantic preparations for the wedding . There was so much to do . Invitations went out to two hundred people . Leslie chose a maid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with matching shoes and gloves to complement the length of the sleeves . For herself , Leslie shopped at Fayette Mall on Nicholasville Road and selected a floor-length gown with a full skirt and a sweep train , shoes to match the gown , and long gloves . Oliver ordered a black cutaway coat with striped trousers , gray waistcoat , a wing-collared white shirt , and a striped ascot . His best man was a lawyer in his firm . " Everything is set , " Oliver told Leslie . " I 've made all the arrangements for the reception afterward . Almost everyone has accepted . " Leslie felt a small shiver go through her . " I ca n't wait , my darling . " On a Thursday night one week before the wedding , Oliver came to Leslie 's apartment . " I 'm afraid something has come up , Leslie . A client of mine is in trouble . I 'm going to have to fly to Paris to straighten things out . " " Paris ? How long will you be gone ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , four days at the most . I 'll be back in plenty of time . " " Tell the pilot to fly safely . " " I promise . " When Oliver left , Leslie picked up the newspaper on the table . Idly , she turned to the horoscope by Zoltaire . It read : For Leo ( July 23rd to August 22nd ) . This is not a good day to change plans . Taking risks can lead to serious problems . Leslie read the horoscope again , disturbed . She was almost tempted to telephone Oliver and tell him not to leave . But that 's ridiculous , she thought . It 's just a stupid horoscope . ... By Monday , Leslie had not heard from Oliver . She telephoned his office , but the staff had no information . There was no word from him Tuesday . Leslie was beginning to panic . At four o'clock on Wednesday morning , she was awakened by the insistent ringing of the telephone . She sat up in bed and thought : It 's Oliver ! Thank God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for not calling her sooner , but that was unimportant now . She picked up the receiver . " Oliver ... " A male voice said , " Is this Leslie Stewart ? " She felt a sudden cold chill . " Who -- who is this ? " " Al Towers , Associated Press . We have a story going out on our wires , Miss Stewart , and we wanted to get your reaction . " Something terrible had happened . Oliver was dead . " Miss Stewart ? " " Yes . " Her voice was a strangled whisper . " Could we get a quote from you ? " " A quote ? " " About Oliver Russell marrying Senator Todd Davis 's daughter in Paris . " For an instant the room seemed to spin . " You and Mr. Russell were engaged , were n't you ? If we could get a quote ... " She sat there , frozen . " Miss Stewart . " She found her voice . " Yes . I -- I wish them both well . " She replaced the receiver , numb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few minutes and find that she had been dreaming . But this was no dream . She had been abandoned again . " Your father 's not coming back . " She walked into the bathroom and stared at her pale image in the mirror . " We have a story going out on our wires . " Oliver had married someone else . Why ? What have I done wrong ? How have I failed him ? But deep down she knew that it was Oliver who had failed her . He was gone . How could she face the future ? When Leslie walked into the agency that morning , everyone was trying hard not to stare at her . She went into Jim Bailey 's office . He took one look at her pale face and said , " You should n't have come in today , Leslie . Why do n't you go home and --  " She took a deep breath . " No , thank you . I 'll be fine . "             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
