If New Yorkers were asked to name the most important symbols of what has been widely celebrated as a glorious era for the city , they would probably start with the fact that the squeegee guys are off the streets . In years past , at certain intersections in Manhattan , menacing-looking characters used to approach cars at red lights and , without invitation , clean the windshield as well as a windshield could be cleaned with a filthy rag . For this they would expect money . They were called squeegee guys . <P> Everybody hated them . If you called in the board members of the American Civil Liberties Union and the most faithful followers of Mother Teresa , assured them that what they said would go no further and asked them individually what they thought of the squeegee guys , I firmly believe they would have each said , " I hate those squeegee guys . " <P> About four years ago , either the new chief of police or the new mayor decided to get rid of the squeegee guys . ( The fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit for the crackdown was the sort of thing that eventually led the mayor to get rid of the chief of police as well . ) Following the crackdown , it was widely assumed that the squeegee guys , after a decent interval , would reappear . That has n't happened . New Yorkers , grateful but intractably suspicious , wonder where the squeegee guys are . <P> " Who cares where they are ? " you might say to a New Yorker . " They 're gone . And the stock market is red hot , and the crime rate is negligible , and Disney is making Times Square the wholesome family-gathering spot we always knew it was underneath all that pornography and drug paraphernalia . New York City has entered a glorious new era . " At which point the New Yorker might ask what you think of the theory that New York City has given a grant to some down-on-its-luck former mill town to take in squeegee guys rather than become the site of a nuclear-waste dump . Or the theory that the squeegee guys are secretly rehearsing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mock-up of Manhattan . <P> The other night , a New York resident named Jean Vallely , who had just returned from California , told me that her windshield had been streaked up by a squeegee guy on San Vicente Boulevard in Brentwood , Calif.  --  the first confirmed squeegee-guy sighting I 've heard of since this whole thing started . It raises the possibility that the squeegee guys , having heard of the O.J. case , are moving out to Brentwood on the theory that a jurisdiction that lets someone get away with murder could n't be hard on people who wash windshields with filthy rags . <P> Then I saw the movie Face/Off . Some of it takes place in an awesomely severe prison whose very existence is secret . It occurred to me that the squeegee guys could be in such a prison . Maybe part of their sentence is to clean windshields over and over with a clean cloth and then decline the quarter offered them by the guard who sits behind the wheel . <P> Such an incarceration would obviously be unconstitutional . I suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the A.C.L.U. How about Amnesty International ? I 'll let someone else do it . I hate those squeegee guys .
