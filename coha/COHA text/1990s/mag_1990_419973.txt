<p> Most people today accept the notion that they had a legal right to protect the natural places they love . But it was n't always so . Once upon a time , in a beautiful , faraway valley called Mineral King .... <p> In 1956 the Sierra Club made Walt Disney an honorary life member in gratitude for his films on wildlife . A dozen years later the Sierra Club launched its first major environmental lawsuit , to block the filmmakers 's bid to build a gigantic ski resort in a remote valley in the Sierra Nevada of California . The ensuing contest would lead to one of the most important Supreme Court decisions over rendered on environmental matters . It would also turn environmental organizations in an entirely new direction : toward the courthouses of the United States . <p> At the Southern end of the Sierra , just before part of the range swings west to join the Tehachapis , a tall , rugged ridge juts southwest  --  the Great Western Divide . To its east is the canyon of the Kern River , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Kaweah . The valley drained by the creeks that join to form the East Fork is known as Mineral King . <p> The valley comes by its name through a bit of wishful thinking . In 1873 a farmer named dames A. Crab-tree entered the valley from the south , guided , he said , by Indian apparitions . He discovered a deposit of silver ore in what came to be known as White Chief cirque , and rushed to town to file a claim . He recruited four men to return to the valley ; they filed more claims and formulated bylaws for what they dubbed the Mineral King Mining District . Silver fever swept through Porterville , the county seat , and then rolled north through the valley , eventually attracting prospectors from as far away as San Francisco . At the peak of mining activity at Mineral King , in 1879 , there were as many as 300 miners working claims in the valley and the high bowls above it , another 100 people improving an old stock trail to handle the expected heavy traffic in ore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabins , and providing other services for the miners . <p> Despite the high hopes for the Mineral King silver deposits , however , the entire enterprise went bust by 1882 . Cold and snowy winters made the mining season short and access treacherous . Avalanches made the work hazardous . The silver ore was said to be " rebellious , " with an unusually high lead content , which necessitated roasting before milling , a prohibitively expensive process . The valley was abandoned by the miners , and nature began in its deliberate fashion to dismantle the cabins , fill in the shafts , and oxidize the trams and culverts and smelters and mills . Soon flowers and grasses and trees began to reappear on the bare , abandoned slopes . The valley still beckoned to campers , hikers , and anglers , and a small resort community flourished into the 20th century , but the heyday of the King had passed . <p> Little is left now to evoke the short boomtown history of Mineral King , but what remained in 1890 was more than enough to keep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that year mainly to protect the groves of giant sequoias growing west and north of Mineral King at somewhat lower altitudes . In 1893 , at the urging of John Muir and the year-old Sierra Club , President Benjamin Harrison proclaimed a vast Sierra Forest Preserve that encompassed most of the western slope of the Sierra  --  6,400 square miles  --  in order to control the grazing , logging , and prospecting that were already playing havoc with the mountains . A dozen years later the U. S. Forest Service was formed , and in 1908 the unwieldy Sierra Forest Preserve ( by then renamed Sierra National Forest ) was divided into three parts . Mineral King was now located in Sequoia National Forest . <p> Muir and the Sierra Club then mounted a major campaign to expand Sequoia National Park to include the high granite wilderness of the central and southern Sierra . The struggle was a lengthy one , with heavy resistance from miners , loggers , would-be dam builders , and the Forest Service . The original grand plan was whittled back several times . When the park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original size , Mineral King was again left out . The valley , however , was transformed into the Sequoia National Game Refuge , to be managed in a manner that would protect wildlife and habitat . <p> A 15,000-acre U-shaped valley carved by glaciers and forested on its lower slopes , Mineral King harbors a diverse community of plants and animals , including such scarce species as bald eagle , peregrine falcon , spotted owl , and wolverine . It is well within the range of the California condor , should that now-incarcerated bird ever again soar through the skies of the state . <p> The floor of Mineral King lies at about 7,800 feet above sea level . Sawtooth Peak , the highest on the ridge that surrounds the valley , reaches 12,343 feet . Trails leading from the valley floor into the high country in three directions range from fairly gentle to strenuous . <p> Since the 1860s , hunters , hikers , and fishermen had visited Mineral King in the summer , just as Indians had done for hundreds of years before them . Visitation in winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually fill the valley from October through May . The road into Mineral King is still the old miners ' wagon route , which snakes its way about 25 miles from the town of Hammond up the East Fork canyon into the valley . Only the most ambitious cross-country skiers visited the valley after October , yet the hardy souls who did ski into Mineral King reported a spectacular spot for skiing : high bowls that border the valley on three sides , deep powder snow , spectacular views . <p> After World War II , the Sierra Club decided to explore the Sierra in search of areas suitable for development as alpine ski resorts . By that time the Donner Pass area was well served with resorts , as were Sonora Pass and Lake Tahoe . But only Mammoth Mountain , on the east side of the Sierra , provided wide-ranging skiing opportunities for Southern Californians , and it took nearly eight hours to drive there from Los Angeles . Accordingly , in 1947 , David Brower and Richard Felter conducted an aerial survey of the range for the Club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new resort was a remote valley in the southern Sierra known as Mineral King . <p> The Forest Service , meanwhile , was also looking for new ski-area possibilities , and it too was drawn to the area . In mid-1949 , the agency issued a prospectus calling for bids " from individuals or firms who can show ability to develop and operate a resort and ski facility at Mineral King . " The Forest Service prospectus called for a hotel accommodating at least 100 people , a mile-long chair lift , a 2,100-foot T-bar lift , and other features , including " over-the-snow " transportation from Three Rivers to the valley . <p> The Sierra Club Board of Directors , acting on the recommendations of its study team , resolved that the Club " finds no objection from the standpoint of its policies to the winter sports development in Mineral King as proposed by the U. S. Forest Service . " <p> Despit the call by the Forest Service and tepid endorsement by the Sierra Club , the agency received not one bid in response to its prospectus . Interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resort , but it would be some time before a package was put together that promised sufficient return to warrant the substantial investment necessary , especially considering the difficult problem of access into the valley in winter . <p> Quiet prevailed at Mineral King until 1961 , when a young geologist from Bakersfield happened upon an intriguing rumor . Hiking in the basin over the Fourth of July weekend , he fell into conversation with a ranger who said he had heard that Walt Disney was planning a ski resort for the valley , with access to be provided by a monorail . <p> The rumor proved well-founded . Over the next several years , Disney employees studied the valley carefully for its ski potential . They also secretly began to buy out the owners of private property in and near the valley . At the same time , Sierra Club members gathered their own information on the geology of the valley , and on its flora and fauna . They aimed to assess the potential impact of a ski resort , not knowing for certain what was in the wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new prospectus and request for proposals . The prospectus described a resort with overnight accommodations for at least 100 people , trams or chair lifts capable of serving 2,000 people an hour , parking for 1,200 automobiles , sanitary and safety structures , and so forth . It was looking for a company or individual to invest at least $3 million in the resort in addition to upgrading the access road to all-weather standards . <p> The Sierra Club took a look at the new prospectus and , after a rather rancorous year of internal argument , pronounced itself opposed to the project . It asked the Forest Service to withdraw the prospectus and convene public hearings on the matter . <p> The Forest Service was not pleased by this unexpected development . It replied that there had been a public hearing on the matter already  --  in 1953 , a dozen years earlier . Another hearing was not necessary . The Forest Service had made up its mind to find a developer for Mineral King . <p> At this point the State of California got into the act , eliminating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : who would pay the estimated $30 million to upgrade the road . On July 16 , 1965 , the legislature incorporated the existing road into the state highway system and appropriated $3 million for preliminary construction . Further funds would be sought from the federal Treasury . <p> On August 31 , 1965 , the Forest Service announced that it had received six bids for development of Mineral King , two of which were considered the leading candidates . One was from Robert Brandt , a Beverly Hills film producer and investment banker . The other was from Walt Disney , one of the best-loved people in the country . <p> At this point , Agriculture Secretary Orville Freeman wrested the decision making power from Forest Service officials and appointed a committee to advise him . In December , Freeman announced that the Disney proposal had been accepted . <p> The Disney plan was decidedly ambitious . Where the Forest Service had called for an investment of $3 million , Disney planned to spend $35 million , and proposed to build as many as 27 chair lifts . The entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumps , sled runs , chalets , and snack bars . Check dams up to 20 feet tall would be built on all the major creeks to keep debris from washing down to the valley floor . A notation that particularly disturbed conservationists read in part , " Considerable slope preparation dynamite will be required in the forested portions because of large boulders in some areas above an elevation of 8,000 feet . . . . Below timberline , trails of varying widths must be developed . . . " <p> Disney also proposed two hotels and a dormitory to accommodate up to 3,000 overnight guests plus a thousand employees , a maximum ski-lift capacity of 11 , 400 per hour , ten restaurants and snack bars , a gas station , a theater , a chapel , a skating rink , and parking for 3,600 cars in a ten-story , five-acre garage beneath the valley itself All this , save the parking garage and service station , would be designed to look like a village in the Swiss Alps . In short , Disney promised to build the world 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would actually comprise more than half the total each year  --  there would be fishing , hiking , tennis , golf , horseback riding , and swimming , in addition to camping in the backcountry of the national park , which could be reached easily by slinging one 's backpack onto a chair lift or gondola . <p> Repeated pleas from the Sierra Club and others for a public hearing on the project were denied or ignored . The Forest Service issued a formal three-year planning permit to Disney on October 1O , 1966 . Two months and five days later , Walt Disney died at age 65 . <p> Attention then turned to the Department of the Interior . For the ski resort to become reality , the access road would have to be widened , straightened , and paved to accommodate more than a thousand cars per hour . This was a daunting technical challenge and would be very expensive , with an estimated cost in excess of a million dollars a mile . It also presented legal problems , in that eight miles of the road would cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the planning permit to the Disney concern , the Park Service had not given permission for improvement of the road segment through the park . There was a matter of principle involved  --  allowing the building of roads through national parks simply to get to the other side was generally forbidden  --  and also the prospect that a new road would carve massive gashes up the valley of the East Fork of the Kaweah and threaten hundreds of giant sequoias . <p> Interior Secretary Stewart Udall was distinctly cool to the whole idea of developing the valley . It was his firm belief that Mineral King was logically and ecologically a part of the national park and no place for a giant commercial development . Udall stonewalled the Forest Service and the state for more than a year , but he was fighting a losing battle . California wanted the resort , the Agriculture Department wanted the resort , and Udall had some political debts to pay . <p> On December 26 , 1967 , the Bureau of the Budget announced that the state would get its right-of-way through Sequoia National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following November , when he gave preliminary approval . The last possible block in the way of the project had been removed . There was nowhere else to turn . <p> Nowhere , that is , except to the courts . On December 14 , 1968 , the Board of Directors of the Sierra Club authorized the filing of a lawsuit to prevent the development of Mineral King . <p> Until the mid-1960s , the federal courts had firmly rebuffed attempts by conservationists to bring cases to court to protect natural resources . In order to establish the necessary " standing to sue , " the courts held that injury to financial interests had to be demonstrated . In 1965 the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York found that in certain circumstances an " aesthetic , conservational , or recreational " interest could suffice to establish standing . The case involved a proposed reservoir at Storm King Mountain on the Hudson River . The Sierra Club had participated in that litigation as a friend of the court , and lawyers on the Sierra Club Legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal affairs , had noted the Storm King decision with interest and had begun to mull over the possibility of taking advantage of it in pursuit of other conservation objectives . <p> Following the Board 's December resolution on Mineral King , Michael McCloskey , the Sierra Club 's conservation director , approached a young attorney named Robert Jasperson , of the Conservation Law Society of America . The Society was the brainchild of long-time Club director Richard M. Leonard , who had established it to provide low-cost legal services to conservation organizations . Jasperson was its only employee . McCloskey asked him to take a look at the Mineral King dispute . <p> Jasperson and another lawyer , Greg Archbald , researched the matter and suggested that the Mineral King project could be illegal in at least three respects . First , according to Forest Service regulations , 30-year leases could cover no more than 80 acres . The Forest Service was skirting this problem by saying it would give Disney a 30-year lease for the 80 acres the hotels and other permanent structures would occupy . The rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of acres for ski runs  --  would be committed via revocable one-year leases . This , Jasperson and Archbald suggested , was a patent attempt to make an end run around the 80-acre limit . <p> A second possible " cause of action " would be against the Park Service , whose regulations require that roads in national parks be simple , narrow , and built solely for the convenience of visitors to the park . Roads are not to be allowed if they are meant only to convey people from one side of a park to the other . The Mineral King road surely fit the latter description . <p> Finally , a major resort development was clearly incompatible with the purposes of a national game refuge . <p> Jasperson and Archbald gave their report to McCloskey , who turned to the Legal Committee , the chairman of which was another young attorney , Phillip Berry of Oakland . Berry had recruited Fred Fisher , a friend from Stanford Law School , who in turn had brought in Don Harris , an avid fisherman who had been active in conservation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mineral King report and determined that it contained the seeds of a worthwhile lawsuit . Neither man had time to take on the case just then , but they enlisted the services of the firm Feldman , Waldman &; Kline , which had offices across the street from the Sierra Club headquarters . Leland J. Selna took the lead in building the case . <p> The Disney team handed its master plan to the Forest Service on January 8. 1969 . On January 18 , in the waning hours of his tenure as Interior Secretary , Stewart Udall issued new road-building rules for the Park Service : The agency could no longer approve any road through a national park without first holding public hearings on both the route and design of the proposed road . On January 21 , the day after Richard Nixon took the oath of office , the Forest Service announced its formal approval of the Disney master plan in language redolent of Madison Avenue : <p> On the site of the old decaying mining town of Mineral King will rise a new self-contained village bearing the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this carefully planned development will create vie of the worlds major outdoor recreation facilities in a spectacular valley of the California Sierras ( sic ) . Free of cars and skillfully blended into the alpine setting , Mineral King and its attractions will provide wholesome enjoyment for thousands of American families . <p> On April 21 , Walter Hickel of Alaska , who replaced Udall as Secretary of the Interior , revoked Udall 's road rules . Formal granting of the right-ofway was thought to be imminent . <p> Lee Selna filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in San Francisco on June 5 , 1969 . The case was assigned to Judge William T. Sweigert . Sweigert had no record in environmental matters , though he was known as something of a maverick , having once ruled that the Vietnam War was unconstitutional . <p> Selna asked the court to issue an injunction that would block the Forest Service and Park Service from allowing any work on the resort or road realignment until the merits of the Club 's case could be determined by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propounded by Jasperson and Archbald : that the road was illegal , the leases were illegal , and the resort would violate the game refuge . Selna argued that an injunction was necessary , because if work were allowed to begin , any damage incurred would be irreparable . The case would never be tried on its merits , however ; what would occupy the courts for many months to come was the critical issue of standing to sue . <p> In its brief to the trial court , the Sierra Club had argued that it should be granted standing simply because its very purpose for existence was the preservation of the Sierra Nevada . The plaintiff asked rhetorically : <p> If the Sierra Club may not be heard , then who speaks for the future generations for whose benefit Congress intended the fragile Sierra bowls and valleys to be preserved ? If the Sierra Club does not have standing , then who may question the threatened illegal acts of the secretaries to whom this unique and irreplaceable natural resource has been entrusted ? Who may challenge their breach of trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priceless in aid of a project for private profit ? <p> The eloquent statement persuaded Judge Sweigert . Nowhere , however , did the Club claim that its interest as an organization or the interests of its members would be harmed by the development at Mineral King . The Club was trying for a far broader affirmation of standing  --  that it had a right to bring suit to defend public lands simply because its principal purpose as an organization was that defense . Whether the Club had overreached its grasp was the question that would be thrashed out over the next three years . <p> Judge Sweigert was not at all bothered by the Club 's broad claim to standing , and he thought the Club had a strong case . On July 23 , 1969 , he issued a preliminary injunction halting all further work on the project , pending trial . The bold stroke had paid off , at least for a time . The story ran in all major newspapers and elicited editorial comment in many of them . Reporters and editors were intrigued by both the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the court in such a fight . <p> The injunction forced the Forest Service  --  and the Justice Department defending it  --  to make a strategic choice . Should they continue to fight the case before Judge Sweigert , who had left little doubt that he considered the Sierra Club 's objections to the development sound and well-grounded in the law and in federal regulations , and then appeal if necessary ? Or should they go straight to the Court of Appeals and ask that court to overrule Judge Sweigert on the procedural question of the Sierra Club 's standing to bring the case in the first place ? <p> The defendants chose the latter course , and five months later  --  on December 29 , 1969  --  challenged the plaintiff 's standing before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco , asking the court to lift the injunction and allow the project to go forward . On September 17 , 1970 , the Court of Appeals , by a vote of two to one , overruled Judge Sweigert and dissolved the injunction . <p> The court went through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sierra Club had not claimed a substantial enough interest in the dispute to warrant its bringing the case at all  --  in other words , that it had no standing to sue . " The proposed course of action the ski resort does not please the Club 's officers and directors and through them all or a substantial number of its members . It would prefer some other type of action or none at all .... We do not believe such Club concern without a showing of more direct interest can constitute standing in the legal sense . " <p> The court then rejected all the Sierra Club 's legal arguments  --  against the size and duration of the leases , against the road right-of-way , and against the misuse of a game refuge . <p> Fortunately for the Sierra Club , the Court of Appeals had not been asked to review the merits of the case  --  only whether the Club had standing and whether the injunction issued by Judge Sweigert was proper . The Club immediately announced that it would ask the U. S. Supreme Court to review the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 the Appeals Court agreed to leave the injunction in place until the Supreme Court could be heard from . Briefs were filed by the various parties  --  Tulare County and the Far West Ski Association had by now weighed in on the side of the ski resort  --  and the high court announced on February 22 , 1971 , that it would review the case . <p> The Disney organization , incidentally , never became a party to the legal battle over its proposed resort , preferring to stay above the fray The Disney attitude seemed to be that . while it would build the resort as a service to the country , its government , and its citizens , it was not begging to do so and would not stoop to fighting over the project in the courts . Disney 's public statements throughout the long battle tended to be restrained and sober . In tact , its spokesmen insisted that they favored allowing the Club 's legal challenge to be tested in court . As Disney project manager Robert Hicks said to the California State Chamber of Commerce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Citizens should have a place to go to test arbitrary and capricious agency actions . The judiciary affords a safety valve which in my judgment is pretty vital to the preservation of this tripartite system of government . This is not all bad , even on my side of the fence . The Sierra Club is doing a lot of people a favor , since these streets must run both ways . " Just as the county and the skiers had entered the arena on the side of the development , three environmental organizations had chimed in on the side of the Sierra Club . Jim Moorman and Bruce Terris of the Center for Law and Social Policy , writing on behalf of The Wilderness Society , Friends of the Earth , and the Izaak Walton League of America , did what the Sierra Club had declined to do : They recited at great length the Sierra Club 's historic and specific interest in Mineral King  --  the use of the valley by the organization , its use by individual Sierra Club members for recreational purposes , and the injury both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were built . <p> During this time , Don Harris and Fred Fisher had applied to the Ford Foundation for funds to establish the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund . In order to qualify for tax-deductible support , the new organization was kept independent of the Sierra Club , which had recently lost its tax deductible status . In the spring of 1971 Ford awarded a grant of $98,000 to support the Legal Defense Fund for two years . The board was made up principally of lawyers . <p> At the group 's first meeting , held at Harris ' home in Berkeley in May , Harris was elected president , Fisher vice-president . The board then embarked on a search for an executive director . They knew of Jim Moorman through his suit against the trans-Alaska pipeline , and they invited him out for an interview . The three men liked each other immediately , and Moorman agreed to begin work in August . <p> In the meantime , Supreme Court arguments were being prepared in the Mineral King case . Moorman appealed to Lee Selna to embrace the standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Selna was firmly committed to the original approach , arguing in favor of a broad concept of standing to sue . <p> On November 17 , 1971 , at 11:06 a.m. , the court sat to hear the arguments in the Mineral King case . <p> In his opening argument , Selna tried to establish the Club 's right to standing . " As an incident of the Club 's interest in the area , some of its members use Mineral King , " he said . <p> " Does the record show that ? " asked Justice Harry A. Blackmun . <p> " The record contains a letter which is written by a member of the Board of Directors of the Sierra Club , in which he in turn refers to his trips to Mineral King , " Selna replied . <p> " But there is n't any direct testimony by members of the Club anywhere in the record , is there ? " Justice Blackmun continued . <p> " Direct testimony concerning their use , Mr. Justice Blackmun ? No , there is not . " <p> Justice Potter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far your argument would go . I 'm reminded of these so-called clubs that get chartered airplane flights across the Atlantic Ocean , these ad hoc organizations . Could I form a club , Friends of Walt Disney Productions , and come in on the other side as a party ? " ( Selna thought not . ) <p> Chief Justice Warren E. Burger wanted to know if John Muir could be a party to the case as an individual . ( Selna thought he could . ) <p> Justice Blackmun tried again to help . " If an organization like the Sierra Club is not qualified to bring litigation of this kind , who would be ? " <p> " Nobody , " Selna answered . <p> Erwin N. Griswold , Solicitor General of the United States , represented the government . He called the case " the ultimate case on standing . If the petitioner here has standing , then I believe it 's fair to conclude that anyone who asserts an interest in a controversy has standing . " <p> Griswold went on , " Should judges be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will not the courts be in a better position to decide the many difficult and important questions which only the courts can effectively resolve in our constitutional system if they do not undertake to decide all the legal questions that anyone  --  anyone  --  wants to present to them ? " <p> In his rebuttal , Selna insisted that finding in favor of the Sierra Club would not throw the court open to cases by " anyone . " <p> " It should be clear from our argument that we do not urge that the doors of the courts be opened wide to anyone . We 've argued that there are criteria that should be applied by a court , by which organisations ' or individuals ' qualifications for standing should be tested . <p> " The Club in this case did , in fact , allege its special interest in the area involved , and no one in California , at the District Court level , had any question in their mind as to the deep involvement of the Club with Sequoia National Park and Mineral King . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a close . <p> The Supreme Court issued its ruling in Sierra Club v. Morton on April 19 , 1972 . By a vote of four to three ( Burger , Stewart , Marshall , and White in the majority Blackmun , Brennan , and Douglas in the minority ) the Court sustained the Court of Appeals in dissolving the injunction , and ruled that the Sierra Club did not have standing to sue . <p> It was clear , however , that the Court majority simply felt that the Club had tried to reach just a little too far , that its claim to standing was a bit too broad . The Club , in short , had failed to allege that it or its members would be injured by the development of Mineral King . " Nowhere in the pleadings or affidavits , " Justice Stewart wrote , " did the Club state that its members use Mineral King for any purpose , much less that they use it in any way that would be significantly affected by the proposed actions of the respondents . " <p> Stewart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most famous footnotes in environmental jurisprudence : " Our decision does not , of course , bar the Sierra Club from seeking in the District Court to amend its complaint .

Before we leave the Supreme Court , however , it is interesting to look briefly at the dissenting opinions <p> Justice Blackmun wrote : <p> The case poses  --  if only we choose to acknowledge and reach them  --  significant aspects of a wide , growing , and disturbing problem , that is , the nation 's and the world 's deteriorating environment with its resulting ecological disturbances . Must our law be so rigid and our procedural concepts so inflexible that we render ourselves helpless when the existing methods and the traditional concepts . . . do not prove to be entirely adequate for new issues ? <p> Justice Douglas contributed his celebrated dissent : <p> The critical question of " standing " would be simplified and also put neatly in focus if we fashioned a federal rule that allowed environmental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the name of the inanimate object about to be despoiled , defaced , or invaded by roads and bulldozers and where injury is the subject of public outrage . Contemporary public concern for protecting nature 's ecological equilibrium should lead to the conferral of standing upon environmental objects to sue for their own preservation .... This suit would therefore be more properly labeled as Mineral King v. Morton . <p> On June 2 the Sierra Club , represented now by Moorman and the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund , marched back into Judge Sweigert 's courtroom and asked for permission to amend its suit . The revised complaint had several new features . It described in considerable detail the Sierra Club 's interests in Mineral King and how those interests would be injured by the Disney project . To be safe , it added as plaintiffs nine individuals who visited Mineral King frequently , plus the Mineral King District Association , a group whose members owned property in and near the valley . <p> And , in what proved to be the coup de grace , it added a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been enacted after the original suit was filed . The law orders federal agencies to prepare an environmental impact statement ( EIS ) for " major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment . " Moorman asked the court to order the government to prepare such a statement on the resort and requested that the injunction be reinstated until the impact statement was completed and a trial could be held on the allegations in the original suit . <p> The government argued that the case should be dismissed because the Court of Appeals had already rejected it on its merits , even though the majority opinion of the Supreme Court had said specifically , " We intimate no view on the merits of the complaint . " Judge Sweigert , who was still irked at having his reasoning spurned by two higher courts , rejected the govemment 's plea , noting that the new claim under NEPA was enough to reinstate the case and reimpose the injunction . <p> The draft EIS was issued on January 3 , 1975 . Comments on the draft were filed by 4,400 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven local government agencies , and 35 private organizations . The California Department of Fish and Game worried about the impact on wildlife ; the Interior Department retained reservations about the impact on Sequoia National Park . Public comments were overwhelmingly anti-resort . <p> By 1975 Mineral King was one of the most prominent national environmental issues . All major national environmental organizations had endorsed the idea of adding the valley to Sequoia National Park , and legislation to accomplish the transfer was rapidly gaining supporters . The Forest Service was still firmly committed to the resort project , but the Disney organization was growing weary of the fight and uneasy as public opposition grew . <p> Moreover , there was still the matter of the road . Disney had always insisted that it would not pay the cost of improving the road to all-weather standards . The federal government had never agreed to undertake the project itself , and in August 1972 California rescinded its earlier pledge to pay for it . In signing the bill that took the access road out of the state highway system , Governor Ronald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was improper for the state to pay for road improvements . <p> The final EIS was released by the Forest Service in February 1976 . The project by that time had shrunk considerably . Projected daily visitation was down from 14,000 to 8,000 in winter and 6,000 in summer . The capacity of the parking lot had dropped from 3,600 to 2,200 . No ski lifts would border the national park ; all ski activity would take place in the bowls on the west and south sides of the valley , well away from the Sequoia backcountry . Oddly , despite the reduced size of the project , the price tag had remained at roughly $35 million , which raised questions about how Disney expected to turn a profit with slightly more than half the customers it had originally anticipated . A visit to the alpine Disneyland was looking like a rather expensive outing . <p> The legal effort on behalf of mineral King came to an end on March 11 , 1977 . Judge Sweigert was preparing to retire from the bench , and since the case had lain dormant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he dismissed it himself for " lack of prosecution . " The judge 's order left the Sierra Club the opportunity to resurrect the case if that became necessary , but in fact the case was closed . An attempt to revive the project was made at the beginning of the Carter administration , but it went nowhere . <p> In October 1978 , as part of a monumental national-parks acquisition and expansion bill , Mineral King was made part of Sequoia National Park , where it belonged from the start .
