HUNGER AND HOPELESSNESS CAN drive people to desperate acts . As a 10-truck U.N . aid convoy entered the Muslim village of Ticici in central Bosnia on its way to Tuzla last Wednesday , more than 200 residents stood waiting by the road . Someone opened fire from the window of a house at the convoy 's police escort , and the villagers mobbed the trucks , grabbing for any supplies they could reach . It was the second attack in two days on a convoy in Ticici , where villagers believe they are not receiving their fair share of food . <P> On Thursday night , gunmen armed with assault weapons ambushed a Land Rover belonging to three British aid workers near a food warehouse in the central Bosnian city of Zenica . The bandits took all three to an isolated spot , where they executed the driver and wounded the other two as they fled . The Overseas Development Administration , which manages British humanitarian aid to Bosnia and carries 40% of U.N.-distributed supplies , suspended its deliveries . <P> Months of strict Serbian and Croatian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banditry and the looting of food meant for the thousands of other Muslim refugees in besieged Tuzla , 45 miles to the north . Increased harassment at checkpoints has cut aid to the Muslims to a fraction of what Serbs and Croats receive . <P> Humanitarian aid is , in the post-cold war world , increasingly the response of choice to the plethora of small-scale slaughters that prick the West 's collective conscience but do not seem important enough to command greater diplomatic or military involvement . The travails in delivery last week were only a symptom of the lack of political will in Western capitals to act forcefully . Humanitarian aid feels good to those who insist that something must be done to stop the killing in Bosnia , in Somalia , in a dozen other bloody conflicts . And it is far more politically palatable than sending soldiers to fight and die in countries  --  without strategic assets like oil or nuclear weapons  --  that few people can locate on a map . But as Bosnia and Somalia show , aid by itself solves very little and rapidly becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid workers paid such a high price for their commitment . Eleven U.N . relief staff members have died in Bosnia . Kidnappings , shootings and death threats are part of the job description in Somalia , where six aid workers have been slain . Although the Clinton Administration denies it , there is a perception that the U.S. has chosen to abandon Somalia rather than contend with the dangers . Turkish General Cevik Bir , leaving the command of the U.N . operation there last week , leaked an " eyes only " letter to U.N . Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali , indirectly chastising the Americans and Europeans for " mission erosion . " Said Bir : " The contributing nations must be committed enough to accept the violence and loss of life associated with war , and then stay the course . "
