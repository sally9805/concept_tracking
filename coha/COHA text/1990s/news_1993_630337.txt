<p> After sitting up on a cross-country train for five of the past eight nights , you 'd figure Joe and Thelma Aaron would be desperate for a long bath and a soft bed . <p> I know I would , and I 've only been riding the rails for two days - sharing a snug " deluxe sleeper " with a hand-held shower that my roommate ca n't seem to master without scalding herself . ( After hearing her yelps , I have n't even tried the fiendish device . ) <p> But here are the Aarons : hand-in hand , snuggling contentedly under a white blanket in the observation lounge car as Amtrak 's Sunset Limited muscles its way toward New Orleans on a warm spring evening . The Winter Park , Fla. , retirees booked their **35;619;TOOLONG odyssey to see America - and they are n't about to let the encroaching darkness , or just plain weariness , spoil the view . <p> " The train is great if you 're not pressed for time , " says Thelma Aaron , who had n't been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We do n't want to miss anything . " <p> This spring 's extension of the Sunset Limited from New Orleans to Miami created the first regularly scheduled trans-continental train in U.S. history . ( Until now , individual passenger cars would be transferred from one train to another . ) <p> By re-establishing the old " Gulf Wind " route between New Orleans and Jacksonville , Fla. , Amtrak allows riders to board in Los Angeles , chug through the Southwest and Deep South , and clamber off in Miami three days later - without changing trains ( and , if you 're traveling in coach , sometimes without changing clothes ) . Not for Type A <p> As the Aarons and I discovered during our journey , going the distance on the new eight-state , 49-stop Sunset Limited is not for Type A personalities . <p> Delays are common , due in part to the fact that Amtrak trains pull over for freight trains on their shared tracks . On the other hand , our scheduled three-hour layover in New Orleans was abbreviated to an hour-and-a-half - just enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a much-appreciated infusion of fresh oysters and cafe au lait . <p> While rail buffs love to tout long-distance trains as " land cruises , " Kathie Lee Gifford of " Fun Ship " fame would be climbing the walls after the first day . Aside from a trivia quiz on famous railroads and a showing of " Sister Act " in the lounge car one evening , on-board commentary and diversions are decidedly limited . <p> " I like it because you do n't have to make decisions , " Thelma Aaron says . But , she admits , sightseeing by rail does n't permit much flexibility : Watching the scenery " is like being in an IMAX theater . You ca n't stop and go back . " <p> Yet for travelers willing to steep themselves in the romance of the rails , riding the Sunset Limited from coast to coast can be a throwback to the days when " travel " was synonymous with " journey " - and the stories swirling around you were as engrossing as the passing parade . <p> After climbing aboard at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday ( the Sunset Limited leaves L.A. for Florida at 11 p.m . Sundays , Tuesdays and Fridays ) , I settle into my bedroom-on-wheels . It 's one of four types of sleeping accommodations , typically sold out weeks in advance , that cost $ 346 to $ 659 above the train fare to Miami . <p> My " deluxe sleeper " is tidy and cozy with a capital C : sink , armchair , couch that transforms into an almost-double bed , and a fold-down upper bunk - complete with an ominous black strap to hold in wayward riders . The toilet-and-shower combo is airplane-sized , with thoughtful ( if disconcerting ) directions that suggest sitting down on the loo while showering . <p> Our ride into the desert that evening is on the lumpy side . Another friend , traveling to Florida with her 2-month-old son in a smaller economy sleeper , would exalt the next morning that the rocking motion prompted baby Austin to sleep through the night for the first time . <p> But I am wide awake at 3:30 a.m. - trying in vain to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marveling that for as far as I can see , the only light out my window is from the setting three-quarter moon . <p> Over the next three days , the Sunset Limited will cross other stretches seemingly bereft of human habitation : Wilcox Playa , an ancient lake bed east Tucson , where dust swirls into vast spirals and mountains soar from the surface of shimmering mirages . The wind-lashed gullies and washes of West Texas . The deep-green bayous of Louisiana 's Cajun Country , where white egrets perch like statues on gnarled cypress knees . <p> But on this trip , natural landscapes are eclipsed by the manmade variety . <p> At Pima Air Park outside Phoenix , mothballed commercial airliners cluster forlornly in the dry desert air - their fuselages glinting like the fins of marooned sharks . <p> In New Iberia , La. , a small boy shoots basketball hoops from a precarious perch on a wooden egg crate - his pig-tailed , pink-dressed sister waving madly as we pass . Nearby , bouquets of fresh flowers adorn an above-ground graveyard ( a necessity in these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in whitewashed splendor next to a rice field . Abandoned cars <p> And in towns across the country , rusted , abandoned cars pepper the side of the tracks like wildflowers - though not as prolific , thankfully , as the buttercups and blue bonnets we ogled in the fields of central Texas . <p> When wrecked Pontiacs lose their appeal , the passengers take over - sharing confidences , spinning tales . <p> Jack Tieger , a retired California salesman who has been riding trains for 50 years , claims he has logged more mileage on Amtrak than anyone else - including his rail-crazy neighbor , sportscaster John Madden . Tieger 's greatest thrill : an hours-long conversation with playwright August Wilson during an overnight run between Miami and New York . <p> " I did n't bat an eye all night long , " Tieger says . " You could n't do that on an airplane . In this stressful world , trains are the great relaxer . " <p> Sylvia , his wife of 51 years , agrees , It has been 30 years since she , four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trek south from New York to Miami on the Silver Star and Silver Meteor - trading housework and snow-covered sidewalks for a few weeks of sunshine and palm trees . <p> Yet even now she can smell the baked chicken that wafted through the club car on those Florida pilgrimages : " For two days , it was constant feeding and diapering , " she says , smiling . " But we knew that as soon as we arrived , the grandparents would take over . And those train rides were some of the best times of our lives . " <p> Janet Jones and Vivien Dewey , meanwhile , are creating memories of their own . The mother and daughter are heading from Houston to New Orleans for a weekend of rest and recreation . " We made a pact , " says Jones . " No work . No kids . No husbands . " <p> " It was kind of a lark , " adds her daughter , who has never been on a train trip before . " I was n't expecting the bumpiness , but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching things . " <p> So , of course , do I. But I find myself envying Jones and Dewey when they step off in New Orleans . By Wednesday night , when Joe and Thelma Aaron have headed home to Winter Park and the Sunset Limited is still more than five hours away from its final destination , I almost lose it . <p> The train is rumbling through Orlando , and out the window I see a jet taking off for parts unknown . I do n't care where it 's headed , or how many sunburned toddlers in mouse ears I 'd be surrounded by . Suddenly , I 'd give anything to trade places . It 's time to get off . <p> Laura Bly is travel editor of the Orange County ( Calif . ) Register .
