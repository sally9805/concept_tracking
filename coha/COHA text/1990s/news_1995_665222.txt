He canceled a visit to the United States in October because of slow recovery . <p> " Nine months after the operation , all is well , but the leg still is n't strong enough to stand on without a cane , " he said .

" <p> Braving the broiling tropical heat , tens of thousands of Filipinos lined the streets along the papal route , erupting into shouts of " Viva Il Papa " Long Live the Pope when radio stations announced his arrival . <p> Crowds cheered and waved Vatican flags as the papal motorcade drove through the streets . <p> The trip , the first abroad since John Paul visited Zagreb , Croatia , in September , will severely test his ability to keep traveling , one of the hallmarks of his papacy . <p> The 74-year-old pope canceled an October visit to the United States because he was recovering too slowly from hip-replacement surgery in April . But he told reporters during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he hoped to visit Belgium , the Czech Republic , Slovakia , Slovenia , the United States and Africa in the coming months . <p> John Paul walked slowly down the stairs from the aircraft Thursday , stopping several times before reaching the tarmac .

" The comments were aimed at Asian Buddhists angered by comments in the pope 's best-selling book . <p> " I voluntarily take the occasion to assure followers of the Buddhist religion of my deep respect and my sincere esteem , " he said . <p> The Philippines is the only predominantly Roman Catholic country on the 11-day swing .

" <p> In Washington , the State Department confirmed receiving information from Philippine officials on bombing threats . It said the U.S. government and the airlines " have implemented special security measures that we believe are sufficient to counter the threats .
