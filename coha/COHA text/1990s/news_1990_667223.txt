<p> Anything but Love is coming back to ABC early next year after being flat-out canceled . And it was n't saved by viewer outrage or a sudden surge in the ratings . <p> " It was Harris Katleman , " says ABC Entertainment President Bob Iger , who was talked into reversing his decision of last May to cancel the series . " His perseverance was instrumental to us reconsidering the show . " <p> Katleman , president of Twentieth Television , 20th Century Fox 's TV production arm , has played a key part in getting and keeping his shows on the air . He has earned a place in the history books , not just as the longest- running TV studio chief - at 10 years , he beats Alan Shayne 's seven-year tenure at Warner Bros. - but for being able to revive not just one , but two canceled shows . ( The first was ABC 's now-defunct Mr. Belvedere . ) The way Katleman wangled Love back on the air offers a behind-the-scenes glimpse at how the television business works . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ network did n't want to " insult " him by ordering only 13 episodes instead of a full season 's worth . Katleman said he 'd accept 13 , but ABC said it was too late - the programming budget already was spent . He went to work on changing their minds . <p> First , he had the producers tell ABC executives of a new direction for the show - the characters played by Jamie Lee Curtis and Richard Lewis would be lovers . Then he started his daily fax ritual to ABC executives : complimentary columns about the show , research touting the show . <p> Katleman talked John Ritter , the star of ABC 's ' 70s hit Three 's Company and executive producer of Love , into phoning Iger to gently suggest that if he wanted the actor to do another sitcom for the network , he would appreciate another chance for Love . Curtis and Lewis phoned , too . <p> Iger finally relented , a decision that , if ratings pick up and the show gets two more years on the air , could reap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ syndication for Twentieth . <p> Twentieth - among the largest of a dozen major studios - has nine series in production . Love and Doogie Howser , M.D. for ABC , L.A. Law and Working It Out for NBC and In Living Color , The Simpsons , Good Grief , Babes and True Colors for Fox . Twentieth 's Cop Rock was canceled . <p> Katleman 's gamble on Love seems to be paying off . In addition to putting the show on the midseason docket , ABC recently ordered two additional episodes . <p> " It 's more important to get a show renewed than to sell a new one , " Katleman says . " Making pilots is very costly . " <p> In a business dominated by younger fellows ,  --  Katleman , 62 , has been at it since the 1950s , when he ran Goodson-Todman 's prime-time production arm . He 's also served as president at MGM ( CHiPs , Medical Center ) and producer at Columbia ( From Here to Eternity ) . <p> " He never quits , " says Gary Nardino , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and Katleman 's Thursday night poker partner . " He keeps his shows in positive consideration every waking moment at the networks . You 've got to be the champion of your material . If you 're not , who will ? " <p> He says Katleman is " a conservative poker player . He 's not crazy like the rest of us . " <p> Katleman is a low-key , personable executive who wears monogrammed shirts , lives in Bel-Air and Palm Springs and watches TV via a satellite dish on Eastern time ( 60 Minutes at 4 p.m. on the West Coast ) . He works out of an elaborate Santa Fe-style office on the Fox lot . <p> ABC 's Iger is n't the only guy in Hollywood Katleman hounds . NBC Entertainment President Warren Littlefield has been getting two calls per week all season , with Katleman suggesting that he move Working It Out , the new series starring Jane Curtin , from Saturdays at 8 : 30 EST/PST to 9 : 30 on Thursday or Saturday . Instead , NBC will try out a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 . <p> " Warren wanted to leave the show on Saturday and let it build , " Katleman says . <p> " But ( producer ) Bill ( Persky ) and I both feel that we have an adult 9 : 30 show here . I said , ' Look , you have a relationship with us and Persky ( the former producer of Kate &; Allie , The Dick Van Dyke Show and That Girl . ) You owe it to us to at least try it on another night . ' " <p> Besides going for time slots , Katleman 's prime focus this season has been on getting his shows renewed . Just ask him about his shows . " Working It Out 's the No. 1 show for women Saturdays at 8 : 30 , " he boasts . " True Colors is Fox 's big hit . " ( But the numbers show that Get a Life is Fox 's highest- rated new show . ) With Cop Rock - " a valiant effort " - gone , Katleman got True Colors renewed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The first two seem assured , but Grief is destined for the cancellation pile . <p> Katleman is already at work on replenishing . Last week , Twentieth taped a pilot for CBS , Stand by Your Man , starring VH-1 's Rosie O'Donnell . <p> The networks have canceled few shows this season - so far , just E.A.R.T.H . Force , The Hogan Family , Hull High and Cop Rock . Instead , they 've opted to save money by playing off all the episodes of the shows they 've ordered . <p> " It 's a time like I 've never seen , " Katleman says . " The economy is down , and they 're all frightened to commit . " <p> But that does n't stop studios like Twentieth from going out and pitching for talent . Last week , Katleman met with Raquel Welch about starring in one of his projects , and with Carrie Fisher - who has a deal with CBS to write and produce a sitcom - about being associated with Twentieth . <p> Studios bank on signing hot producer/writers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Twentieth 's stable includes former Family Ties writer Michael J. Weithorn , who created and produces True Colors , and Lon Diamond , the co-creator of Columbia Pictures TV 's Parker Lewis Ca n't Lose , who will produce his next series for Twentieth . <p> Keenen Ivory Wayans , John Ritter and Dolly Parton have production companies based at Twentieth . Steven Bochco is affiliated with Twentieth , but ABC pays the lion 's share of his production budget , and Twentieth syndicates his shows . <p> What you wo n't see any more of from Twentieth TV are hourlong action shows . <p> CBS ' hourlong The Flash - its pilot cost $ 6 million - " would n't have gotten past my development meeting , " Katleman says . " It 's impossible to do an hour show without substantial losses , and that kind of show could kill you . If I had approved that show , I would n't be sitting here today . " <p> The job of TV studio chief tends to end after four or five years , with the executive becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " The key to his longevity , " Iger says , " is that he continues to approach the job like a young man . He 's managed to miraculously be free of the cynicism and that 's refreshing .
