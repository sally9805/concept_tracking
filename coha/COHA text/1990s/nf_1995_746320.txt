Introduction <p> In The Black Man 's Burden , 1 the preeminent British Africanist Basil Davidson forays into the roots of the African crisis . After arguing that the crisis is caused by the institutions of the nation-state inherited and copied from Europe , he concludes that it can be solved only by recourse to modernized African precolonial institutions ( societies ) or the invention of new ones through the unification , or at the very least , regional unification of Africa . Unlike Davidson , Goran Hyden , another Africanist , argues that the crisis is caused by the " economy of affection " of African precolonial societies , and he proposes , in evolutionary terms , capitalism and its attendant bourgeois-led strong state and institutions as the solution. 2 Thus , both authors , contrary to most analyses of contemporary Africa , take seriously African precolonial societies . The inherited post-colonial state explanation used by Davidson has already been debated and challenged. 3 Hyden 's work has also been amply questioned for different reasons. 4 However , precolonial societies , the cornerstone of Davidson 's solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Prescriptions about the African crisis require , if not a theory , at least an explanation of African society today . Such a theory is possible only by bringing precolonial societies back to the center of the debate . This essay attempts such an explanation in order to choose between the solutions proposed by the above two authors . The Leading Proposition and its Antecedents <p> Insofar as discussions about Africa today involve implicit ( but not normative ) comparisons with the West , the African crisis is inseparable from African society . As contemporary Western society can not be defined outside of capitalism likewise African society today can not be defined outside " pseudocapitalism , " that is , Africa 's obviously distorted features of capitalism. 5 Therefore , the validity of Davidson 's solutions and Hyden 's theory can be determined only by analyzing the relationship between precolonial societies , the cornerstone of their analysis , and pseudocapitalism . In light of this , the essay 's guiding argument or proposition can be summarized as follows : <p> African precolonial ( not colonial or postcolonial ) societies were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the primacy of lineage . Because of this absence , the organization of material production and politics did not rely on economic and physical coercion as they did in a class society ; instead , they relied on ideological coercion . In addition , as in other societies , ideology was needed to play the broad role of legitimation in lineage societies . As a result , their mode of production displayed , unlike any other mode of production , a triple dependence on ideology , which explains the higher level of ideological routinization , hence , the abundance of rituals in lineage societies . The triple dependence constituted their structural dynamism . By defining their core relations , this dynamism traced the noncapitalist path of development of African societies and prevents one from postulating their " transition " to capitalism in precolonial times ; the inherent dynamism of the noncapitalist path of development militated against the implantation of Western capitalism , hence explains the heroic role of pre-colonial societies in the making of pseudocapitalism in colonial and postcolonial periods . Contrary to Hyden 's claims of " stagnant economy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ societies and their heroic " struggle " that resulted in pseudocapitalism did not cause Africa 's contemporary crisis . The latter is a structural outcome of pseudocapitalism and defies any evolutionary solution to it . And because , contrary to Davidson 's and other imperialism-inspired claims , precolonial structural dynamism needs to be taken seriously in explaining pseudocapitalism , such dynamism militates against Davidson 's call for the adoption of the very precolonial institutions ( hence their dynamism ) to solve **26;250;TOOLONG crisis . Rather , the answer lies in Davidson 's second solution , that is , the unification , or at the very least , regional unification of Africa. 6 <p> In the above proposition , I suggest that an absence of class relations explains the primacy of lineage in African precolonial societies . The claim requires evidence , which I have provided elsewhere.7 Only a skeleton of the main empirical and theoretical evidence is supplied here to serve as antecedents for the argument of the essay that follows . <p> Contrary to the theoretical defects of the earlier models on " kinship " and revisionist anthropology , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " individualism " and " initiative , " as if Africans were deprived of individualism and initiative within the lineage structure , I have reestablished the centrality of lineage in African precolonial societies . Using data from central , eastern , and southern Africa , I have argued that lineage 8 constituted the backbone of their social relations . Obvious differences among these societies notwithstanding , relations of production were dominated by the lineage , which structured both the positive and negative rights of allocating land . In both non-centralized ( e.g. , Kikuyu and Ambuun ) and centralized societies ( e.g. , Kongo and Swazi ) , politics and the state rested on prescriptions of lineage . Relatively autonomous groups ( e.g. , religious societies , age grading systems , gender associations ) did exist ; but they ; like groups in capitalist societies which can not operate outside the prescriptions of capitalism , could not avoid the lineage 's influence . In playing this role , the lineage structure was characterized by an abundance of rituals , examples of which were the ancestor cult , the seniority code @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king . These rituals are generally referred to as " witchcraft , " " myths , " " religion , " or " superstition . " In the 1930s , an Italian priest counted 77 types of " superstitious " rituals among the Kikuyu . <p> The primacy of lineage was both a structural cause and effect of an absence of class relations in these societies . Lineage was a deterrent to class control , not because of " blood ties " among its members , but because of its type of production relations , a sine qua non in Karl Marx 's rigorous definition of class relations 9  --  and such a definition is crucial to avoid confusion between elite theory and class theory . Lack of class ties , in turn , reinforced the primacy of lineage . Therefore , empirically and theoretically , the four-set class relations proposed by Africahist anthropologists and historians ( slaves versus their owners ; nobles versus commoners ; kings/chiefs versus commoners ; and kings and their aura versus everyone else ) is indefensible . <p> Once the primacy of lineage is asserted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rituals ( " superstitions " ) in these lineage-dominated societies ? The answer to this question can only be theoretical and it helps explain ( 1 ) African precolonial core relations and their non-capitalist path of development and ( 2 ) their heroic struggle again capitalism that led to pseudocapitalism . Precolonial Core Relations , Structural Dynamism and the Non-Capitalist Path <p> The standard evolutionary answer is that the abundance of rituals is the characteristic feature of " prenewtonian " and preindustrial societies , 10 or sheer " myth and nonsense " 11 The guiding proposition I advance differs from this answer and suggests that the primacy of lineage over class relations explains the triple dependence on ideological coercion and the abundance of rituals . " Being dependent " differs from suggesting , as some do , that lineage is mere ideology . This triple dependence defines the very dynamism of African precolonial societies . How so ? <p> Beyond its well-known cognitive , affective , and evaluative dimensions , ideology represents the imaginary relationship of individuals to their real conditions of existence. 12 By " imaginary " I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illusion of , and an allusion to , reality . The relationship is a two-tier nexus . Ideology creates an imaginary relationship between individuals or subjects ( s ) and a bigger subject ( S ) , for example , ancestors or God . The imaginary relationship , in turn , distorts the real conditions of existence of individuals/subjects ( e.g. , economic ownership of interests , political domination ) . It conceals them by elevating itself , through rituals , practices , and myths . And in so doing , the imaginary relationship reproduces the conditions of existence of individuals/subjects in ways consistent with the goal of ideology . By reproducing the real conditions of existence , the imaginary relationship subordinates these conditions to ideology 's rituals . Ideological practices and rituals are taken so much for granted by individuals that they become routine . Moreover , individuals are unaware of their involvement in these rituals because they become identical with other real types of political , economic , and social practices . Because of the dependence of the real conditions of existence on ideology , ideological rituals and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One can refer to this property of ideology as " ideological routinization " or " ritualization . " ( See Figures 1 and 2 . ) <p> As in all societies , the accumulation of material production and surplus product preoccupied African precolonial societies , a fact recognized , however reluctantly , by anthropologists. 13 As in all societies , the means to organize such an accumulation involved a primary form of coercion , either political/physical coercion ( e.g. , the use or threat of physical means of compulsion/violence such as jail , the police , army , or death ) , economic coercion ( e.g. , wage ) , or ideological coercion ( e.g. , a curse or threat of impeding disaster , illness , or mishap from the elders , ancestors , or God ) . But the choice of coercion was , above all , a function of the prevailing type of society . Class domination justifies physical ( and economic ) coercion , whereas non-physical/ideological coercion is congruent with the absence of class exploitation . Because of their peculiarity ( i.e. , primacy of lineage over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic or physical coercion ; instead they offered the perfect breeding ground for ideological imaginary relationships , hence , ideological coercion . <p> A lineage was a network of real relations of existence . Its specificity resided in its ability to secrete , more than other social orders , an exceptionally high dose of imaginary relationships at two levels . The first level consists of ideological reconstruction through genealogical accounts using charters . Not only did charters create fictitious descent filiations besides real ones but they were also rewritten to depict a positive picture of the lineage founders , their deeds , or their descent lines . This aspect is well covered in the anthropological literature. 14 The second level of ideological reconstruction best elucidates the notion of imaginary relationships . Lineage societies ' real conditions of existence included the relations of extraction , economic ownership , distribution of economic resources , and political relations and conflicts . The first level of ideological reconstruction was not enough to offset the nonuse of class economic and political/physical coercion . The change and maintenance of these real conditions of existence depended upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types of imaginary relationships were present : between the dead ancestors and living lineage members ; between lineage heads/seniors as representatives of the ancestors , on the one hand , and lineage members , on the other ; and between the lineage members and the lineage itself as exemplified by the fear and horror expressed by Africans in all the societies about losing their lineage via slavery . Each type of relationship formed a subject-Subject ( s-S ) relationship . Together , they explain the abundance of rituals , ancestral cults , and such practices as deep respect for elders , sorcery , initiation , and divination ( see Fig. 1 ) . The societies mentioned show how these rituals , hence , ideological coercion , organized production , and the extraction of surplus product , including slave labor . An example is the role played by the lineage heads , as representatives of the ancestors , in the organization of production , the allocation of land , and the extraction of the surplus product . The king or the grand chef , for instance , made rain , required labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lineage bonds with , and proximity to , deceased chiefs or other dead ancestors , which endowed him with supernatural powers . These ideology-dependent relations of production explain the specificity of the exercise of political power in African precolonial societies , namely that , despite the presence of the state apparatus and a king , physical coercion was not often used in the organization of production and political organization . <p> These points about the state and politics need elaboration . Politics is the expression of competitive interests of individuals , groups , or classes making up society . It is inseparable from the state , which is the relationship formed by these social actors as they are regulated by political power in its coercive form . As such , politics and the state are not , contrary to the " stateless societies " thesis , the exclusive attribute of a particular society , or class society as is generally contended . Politics and state in precolonial Africa were lineage-based . Ideology is not the same as politics . Even though politics makes use of ideology , each maintains its identity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; every society relies on some kind of ideology . Insofar as political power and politics rely on coercion , however , not all societies/states use the same type of coercion . Again , depending on the prevailing type of society/mode of production , the choice is between physical coercion and ideological coercion . <p> Because the state and politics in a class society embody and reflect the type of domination and exploitation present in the core relations of the mode of production , the domination is ineluctably congruent with physical coercion . For example , the state and politics rely on physical coercion ( jail , police , army ) in feudal and capitalist societies because their respective core relations involve class domination . In lineage societies , by contrast , because of the absence of class relations and the subordination of politics to lineage core relations , political power relied not on physical coercion but on ideological coercion . This is not to suggest that lineage-based states never used physical coercion . African precolonial states/kings did use death penalties and military might in their exercise of power . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first , lineage states generally used physical coercion against other states/societies/tribes , not their own people , a practice wrongly explained by Bronislaw Malinowski as a result of blood ties among the subjects  --  not every subject was of the royal blood . Second , precisely because of the reliance on ideological coercion , recourse to death and physical coercion in internal affairs was extremely rare , which explains why , among the Kikuyu and almost all southern and central African chieftainships , no police force was necessary . Among the Xhosa , deterrence against physical coercion was expressed at the investiture of the chief : " May your conduct be reputable . . . . May your hand be beautiful and not seek out a person 's body , " ( literally , lifting up the hand against another , or physically coercing another ) . 15 Third , and more importantly , at stake was the issue of legitimacy of the polity . In a class society , where coercion is mostly physical , legitimacy results from the subjects/citizens constantly assuming and fearing the use of force by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In lineage societies governed by ideological coercion , however , legitimacy results first from the subjects ' ideology-inspired fear of the holders of state power ; the fear of force comes second . <p> Dependence on ideological coercion explained the abundance of elaborate and sacred rituals used by African precolonial kings and chiefs in the exercise of political power . The itwika ceremony among the Kikuyu that consecrated the political power of any new political council through elaborate priestly rituals during which a monster ( ndamathia ) appeared from the waters ; the sacred cooking fire ; the occasional drinking of human blood by the king , and incestuous sexual relations between the king and his niece among the Luba ; the use of body parts of the king 's predecessor in strengthening the king 's power among the Luba and South African Bantu ; the ngoma , the symbol of the king 's omnipotence shown only at his death , and the fact that the king and some chiefs could not be seen eating among the Kongo and Ambuun ; and the famous golden stool ( Sia Dwa ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rest on the knees of King Osei Tutu of the Asante ( in today 's Ghana ) thanks to the invocation of Priest Anokye . All these were practices that were not " superstitions " or the " nonsense " of preindustrial societies but the material representation of ideological coercion so essential in the exercise of political power . <p> The reliance on ideological coercion solves the anthropological puzzle : precolonial kings were " divine " and invested large amounts of resources in " religious " activities and monuments , but not because they were particularly religious . They exercised political power through ideological coercion . The latter , expressed in the abundance of rituals , served as a means by which to organize political relations , including the extraction of tribute/tax . <p> As stated earlier , ideology is not the exclusive attribute of lineage societies . Every society uses ideological rituals for broad legitimation purposes . For this reason , and to avoid misunderstanding , it is worth underscoring that ideology is crucial in capitalist societies . It is ex-pressed in the form of commodity fetishism and mystification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among things , 16 and in the form of equal opportunity that sustains liberal democracy and its attendant hegemonic consensus ? Because it is important , ideology plays an important role in broadly reproducing , often by concealing them , the real conditions of existence ( i.e. , relations of ownership and extraction , distribution of resources , political relations , and competition ) under capitalism and feudalism . Ideology . does not , however , intervene directly in the functioning of these conditions , especially the extraction of the surplus product , which functions by means of physical and economic coercion . Indeed , under capitalism , physical coercion protects and regulates directly the distribution of resources among competing interests , the relationship between the rulers and the ruled , and the relations of ownership . The extraction of surplus is also realized directly through economic ( wage ) and physical coercions . More concretely , in a capitalist society , it is not ideology that constitutes the direct incentive for workers ' productivity or the means of pressure against a delinquent , debtor , tax payer , or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or jail , as economic and physical coercions , are the means of pressure . Ideology , as a means of legitimation , remains in the background . <p> Lineage societies differed from capitalist and other types of society in a crucial aspect . In addition to the broad legitimation of the real conditions of existence , ideological rituals were at the same time the means of organizing production , the extraction of surplus product , and political power in these societies . Not only does ideology play the broad role of social reproduction , but ideological coercion regulates daily and directly the relations of ownership , the extraction of surplus product , the relationship between the rulers and the ruled , competing individual or group interests , and the distribution of resources . Thus , ( 1 ) the broad role played by ideology in the legitimation process , ( 2 ) the direct reliance of the state and politics on ideological coercion , and ( 3 ) recourse by society and state to ideological coercion for extraction and production purposes explain the exceptionally high number of ideological rituals in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-use of class physical and economic coercion . In short , their core relations can be referred to as ideology-dependent core relations . <p> This situation has an important consequence . By relying directly on ideological coercion , the real conditions of existence of lineage societies were made triply and inextricably dependent on ideological rituals . The result was the pervasiveness of rituals and a higher level of ideological **27;278;TOOLONG than in other societies . Here appeared the structural indistinguish ability between the real conditions of existence of lineage societies and the ideological rituals . For the people of lineage societies , the reality and ideology were ( are ) the same . Ideological rituals became interchangeable with real life , more so than under capitalism or feudalism ( Figs. 1 and 2 ) . One understands , then , Wole Soyinka 's refusal  --  shared by the Afrocentrists  --  to isolate " cultural " and cosmological issues from other aspects of African life.is This particularity , ascribable to ideology-dependent core relations , contributed to the structural dynamism of precolonial African societies . It helps explain the precolonial non-capitalist path of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ core relations of precolonial societies susceptible to a " transition " to capitalist core relations well before the expansion of Western capitalism ? In light of the above analysis , the answer is no . Capitalism is characterized first and foremost by the separation of the producer from the means of production ( owned by the capitalist ) at both the ownership and production process levels . However important , private ownership and commodity markets are simple appendages to this core relationship . By relying on wages , capitalism reflects this double separation , which is consistent with the relations of production being based on the extraction of the surplus product from one class by another class . <p> Lineage societies were incongruent with capitalist core relations , notwithstanding claims that capitalism had existed in Africa since the sixteenth century via Atlantic slavery or through the " market "  --  neither slavery nor the market defines capitalism . The reason lies in the presence of ideology-dependent core relations and the high level of ideological **27;307;TOOLONG in those societies . By playing the triple role in lineage societies , ideological rituals perpetuated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intrinsically non-capitalist relations of lineage societies . To understand this , recall that ideology reproduces the real conditions of existence of individuals by subordinating these conditions to its imaginary relationships and rituals . In a sense , these conditions ( real life ) can not stand on their own . In lineage societies this dependence was stronger because of the triple and direct dependence on ideological rituals . Unlike in other societies , the very pervasiveness of ideological rituals almost totally controlled the conditions of reproduction of the social order , especially its relations . Given that , for social individuals , rituals and their real conditions of existence were more indistinguishable than in other types of society . This higher routinization could not allow " capitalist " change in their social relations of production , for the latter themselves became ritualized . This situation is consistent with the point made by Anthony Appiah and others that " Africans do things because their ancestors have always done so . " 19 But they wrongly attribute it , in evolutionary terms , to the " prenewtonian thinking " of Africans . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relations ; structural indistinguish ability between real life and ideological rituals so routinized the core productive relations that Africans " operated " these relations in a ritualistic manner , reproducing always the core lineage relations . Contrary to the nineteenth century European notion of " dead hand of tradition , " this formulation does not imply African stagnation . On the contrary , it gives to African societies what is owed them : they followed a historical trajectory of their own . Their was no " natural " or predictable need for a " transition " to capitalism , nor did Africans envy such a transition . <p> Changes in forces of production , tensions , and conflicts did take place , but they did not alter core relations so highly routinized . These relations were reproduced over time . The transition to capitalist core relations could not take place because the ritualization meant reproducing collective ownership of the major means of production , land ; dual control over the labor process whereby the lineage and the worker qua lineage member owned different categories of the means of labor ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surplus product itself . Insofar as the state was concerned , it reflected society . Its reliance on ideological coercion also perpetuated the non-capitalist relations . The best illustration of this is provided by the king 's intervention in reinforcing and legitimizing lineage-based relations/competition among his subjects and clients . Because they were not capitalist and could not make a transition to capitalism but reproduced their core relations ( an effect of their structural dynamism ) , precolonial societies gave the impression of " remaining intact and stagnant " to dualist theorists . <p> The foregoing analysis has implications for explaining pseudocapitalism . As Western capitalism expanded , especially via colonialism , was its implantation feasible in African lineage societies ? Differently put , could expanding capitalism transform precolonial non-capitalist core relations into capitalist ones ? The answer to this question is also negative . I will focus on the Kenyan and Zairian cases as representative of eastern and central African precolonial societies . Explaining Pseudocapitalism : The Cases of Kenya and Zaire <p> In addition to the expansionist and exploitative power of capitalism/imperialism recognized here , I assume that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases ; that the degree of capitalist penetration differed from one country to another ; that with the onset of colonial rule , social classes did occur in African societies ; that through taxation , forced labor/recruitment , and ( in the Kenyan case ) the pass system and land **27;365;TOOLONG , proletarianization did take place ; and that in colonial Zaire and Kenya such a process was more advanced than in most African countries . For the 1952-54 period , the percentage of the population engaged in wage labor was 8.0 percent in Kenya and 9.3 percent in Zaire. 20 Only South Africa and Egypt had more wage laborers than these two countries . <p> All these facts notwithstanding , the imposing fact remains that capitalist core relations remained circumscribed and isolated . A clear indication of this isolation was the emergence of " enclave economies " within whose limits capitalist core relations remained blocked . The latter 's extension to peasant agriculture is almost nonexistent . Dualist/modernization theorists explain this situation by the " stagnation " of African precolonial societies . Imperialism-inspired theories impute it to what almighty capitalism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colonial policies or policies of private or public actors from capitalist centers impeded the implantation of capitalism . These two views have already been questioned . In the case of imperialism-inspired theories , they are only partially correct . Undoubtedly , colonial policies were contradictory in many ways , impeding the very implantation of capitalism . In addition to the opposition of the settlers to African would-be capitalist farmers in both colonial Kenya and Zaire , colonial administrations in both countries gave almost no support to African farmers or entrepreneurs . In the case of Kenya , " by 1910 the only consideration of systematic aid to African cultivators focused on Africans in the coastal areas because no Europeans would settle there for climatic reasons . " 21 In colonial Zaire , by 1958 , Africans controlled only 5 percent of the total invested capital. 22 Although colonial Zaire did not have the Kenyan equivalent of African overcrowded and overused reserve lands , its policy of paysannat indigene that sought to create a class of capitalist farmers in the 1930s by privatizing lineage lands failed partially because plots were concentrated on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to produce cash , crops . Moreover , in both colonies , massive force was used to create wage labor in a system that was based on the premise that the creation of a free labor market was the sine qua non for personal freedom. 23 Finally , in both colonies , the economic structure was shaped to suit the interests of the metropolitan economy . <p> Yet , there are important reasons why the expansion of capitalism does not imply capitalist implantation , and negative imperialist policies do not explain such non-implantation . First , the manifestations of pseudocapitalism , especially the persistence of precolonial , non-capitalist relations , clearly reveal that capitalist expansion is not the same as capitalist implantation . Economic growth , class relations , and imperialist exploitation are not exclusive attributes of capitalism ; they coexist with different socioeconomic systems . Second , without minimizing their effects , the role played by imperialist policies in the making of pseudocapitalism is overstated . The British colonial policy of subordinating African personal freedom in Kenya to a free labor market ( which for them meant capitalism ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom in Zaire on capitalist private property , confirm that although these policies used means congruent with the implantation of capitalism , such an implantation did not take place . Comparative data provide further evidence that colonial policies were not the primary reason for the non-implantation of capitalism . In Ghana , Uganda , and Tanganyika ( Tanzania ) , where the British supported and aided African would-be capitalist farmers more than in Kenya , 24 agrarian capitalism did not flourish any better than in Kenya . In fact , the opposite holds true , at least in the cases of Uganda and Tanzania because in the post-colonial era there have been more islands of agrarian capitalism in Kenya than in the other two counties . Likewise ; the fact that Belgian policies in Zaire discouraged , more than the French did in West Africa , the emergence of African capitalist entrepreneurs did not make West Africans more capitalist than Africans in Zaire . In both situations , precolonial core relations dominated because in West Africa the chief planter extracted labor from workers not as a capitalist but as a traditional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then , that the primary reason that capitalist expansion via colonial rule ( or in the post-colonial period ) did not lead to capitalist implantation but to pseudocapitalism is not because of imperialism and Western capitalism . I argue in the next few pages that the failure of capitalism to implant itself is ascribable not to the " stagnation " of African precolonial societies but mostly to the neutralization of ( or the heroic struggle against ) capitalism by the structural dynamism ( ideology-dependent core relations and their ritualization ) of these societies . <p> In both Kenya and Zaire , attempts to implant capitalism were indistinguishable from colonial land policies . The policies had almost the same components : the contestation of lineage-owned lands by the colonial administration , leading in the case of Kenya to the establishment of African reserves ; the appropriation of large land areas for the benefit of European settlers or corporations ; and attempts to institute , in the African lands , an agrarian capitalism while creating through various policies a class of wage earners whose survival depended on the sale of their labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lands by the settlers in Kenya was as old as colonial rule itself , attempts to institute agrarian capitalism in the reserves went arm-in-arm with colonial attempts to respond , from 1910 to the 1940s , to the mounting African protest against the appropriation of their lands . But it was in the post-World War II period that the colonial government seriously attempted to consolidate small lots of land into bigger capitalist-like farms . This process was accelerated during the Mau Mau insurgency and the state of emergency that followed in the 1950s ; the process of consolidation and registration was " achieved " in the post-independence period . In Zaire , by contrast , attempts were made to install agrarian capitalism in the 1930s with the implementation of the policy of the paysannat indigene that aimed to privatize lineage-owned lands . <p> The neutralization of capitalism by ideology-dependent core relations of precolonial lineage societies was instigated in many ways by these policies . An earlier sign of the reproduction of these relations was the intractable struggle they waged against the proletarianization of African labor . In colonial Kenya and Zaire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdraw them from their precolonial relations were ferociously resisted . The resistance was not the result of " personal choice " by would-be workers . Rather , " Africans persistently resisted the changes in the whole economic and social pattern of their lives which was demanded by the policy transforming them into regular wage earners . " 27 The lesson of the intractability and reproducing power of the precolonial ideology-dependent core relations was not lost on colonial officers . " European settlers and administrators eventually discovered . . . that to obtain sufficient numbers of Africans for labor , they would have to coerce Africans out of their existing economic structure by transforming the structure totally . " 28 Hence , one understands the use of massive force by colonial officers in their attempts to expand capitalist relations in both colonies . " Transforming the structure " included reacting to the " visible " aspects of lineage core relations . For instance , when Kenyans avoided taxes on huts that sought to make them wage laborers , they relied more and more on lineage relations by crowding into fewer huts that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revealed the reproducing power of ideology-dependent core relations , the colonial administration reacted by decreeing that taxes on individuals could be paid by entire homesteads/villages or even larger tribal groupings , the visible manifestations of the core relations. 29 In Zaire , the colonial administration often reacted by arresting lineage heads . Despite the arrests , the success of the policy was not always guaranteed . The reproducing power of the ideology-dependent core relations also explained the generalized confusion among colonial officers about " African laziness . " In precolonial times , Africans despised wages , exploitation , and profit 30 because of its inconsistency with the lineage core relations and not because it was in " their nature . " As an effect of the ideology-dependent core relations , such distaste for wage labor was reproduced in the earlier days of colonial rule and was easily interpreted as " laziness " by European colonial officers and settlers . In Kenya , the effect of this resistance of pre-colonial core relations to colonial attempts to implant capitalism through wage labor was the call to Asians to serve as substitute workers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ideology-dependent core relations to attempts to implant agrarian capitalism , which , in most cases , coincided with the expropriation of African lineage-owned lands that were confused with " vacant " lands . Although in Kenya the land-owning lineage was in most cases smaller than in Zaire , the pattern of precolonial relations of production in both situations had sowed the seeds of resistance . Lineage  --  the framework of ideology-dependent core relations  --  led the resistance through its elders . In Zaire , it was often through the heads of chieftainships . In Kenya , during the first major hearing by the colonial administration on land issues in 1932 , 300 claims were introduced on behalf of more than 600 mbari ( subclans ) among the Kikuyu ; and the dispute revolved around the type of precolonial " ownership " the head of the subclan ( muramati ) had over the subclan 's estate ( ithaka ) . 31 In all the cases involved , at issue was the unsuccessful attempt by capitalist core relations to supplant lineage ideology-dependent core relations . The following four reasons can be identified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to colonial officials that were inconsistent with capitalism . The use of massive compulsion that reduced peasant free participation in the paysannat indigene in colonial Zaire and in other agrarian policies in Kenya resulted from noncompliance to the orders of the colonial authorities , itself an effect of the reproduction of lineage core relations . However detrimental to the Africans and to capitalism , the policies of African reserves in Kenya and of the biased support for European set-tiers in Zaire were actually the result of the staunch opposition of the lineage core relations to capitalist core relations . Indeed , it was this opposition expressed in the form of unreceptiveness to colonial policies that had caused the British to contemplate the establishment of a dual economy in which Europeans and Africans would occupy two economic spheres distinct from each other. 32 Although this did not become the official policy , the policy of African reserves came close to it. 33 <p> Second , contrary to the claim that capitalism " chooses " to maintain precolonial relations , the debate that surrounded the land issue in Kenya and Zaire provides ample @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reproducing power of the ideology-dependent core relations to maintain these relations , thus undercutting the very goal of the implantation of capitalism . In colonial Zaire , despite their clear commitment to capitalism many of those interested in the colonial enterprise used the lineage organization as the main reason to reject the policy of land privatization . One of the reasons advanced to justify privatization was that it would nullify the role of lineage elders and chiefs . Opponents of the policy argued that the authority of the chiefs was limited in precolonial times by a whole range of " superstitious " ( hence , ideological ) beliefs . In fact , they maintained , the chiefs appointed by the colonial administration were the ones most likely to commit abuses against peasants because they were not bound by the types of ideological prescriptions that limited the actions of legitimate chiefs . Moreover , in the precolonial era , the chiefs collected tribute as an expression of their ideology-dependent political authority . The authority would not cease to exist simply because land was privatized . At any rate , the chiefs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was invisible and feared ( hence , it was ideological ) . Private property would not easily modify the situation. 34 The opponents ' position clearly demonstrated the ability of the factors inherent in " traditions , " that is ideology-dependent core relations , to force the colonial administration to retreat from its policy of capitalist implantation to a more precarious stand as exemplified by the adoption of what came to be known as the " mixed system . " Because it could not eradicate " traditions , " it had to sustain them . The land privatization policy failed . The same holds true for Kenya ; amid the debate about " progressive " farming , the colonial government sought paradoxically to shore up the communal tenure system to avoid , as was also argued in Zaire , a landless proletariat . But the more important reason was that the African tenure system offered a better social insurance for the Africans and was difficult to convert to a European/capitalist system . For this reason , when the registration of lands became a routine policy by 1952 , jurisdiction over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " traditional laws and customs . " 35 Recourse to precolonial laws has continued to dominate the juridical debate over land in postcolonial Kenya. 36 <p> Third , that ideology-dependent core relations forced colonial authorities to maintain these relations is demonstrated by the heated debate over the merits of types of colonial rule ( indirect or direct ) and the policies of chieftainships . The " mixed system " in Belgian territories , the formal adoption of indirect rule in British colonies , and the failed assimilation ( direct ) policy of the French and the Portuguese in their colonies reveal that in all these cases indirect rule prevailed , except when direct intervention of the coercive apparatus of the colonial state was needed . The flirtation with and adoption of indirect rule was not because of the colonizers ' " concern " or " respect " for African traditions . Such a respect would be antithetical to the colonial venture . Nor was it consistent with the goal of establishing capitalism , which could be accomplished only through a destruction of precolonial lineage core relations via direct rule . Rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colonial powers ( although some officials did see some benefits for the colonizing power in maintaining indirect rule ) , the inclination toward indirect rule revealed the failure of direct rule ( obvious in the French case ) to implant capitalism because of the fierce resistance by highly routinized ideology-dependent core relations . Only indirect rule , colonial officers thought , could weaken the resistance . But this was not the case . <p> In both Kenya and Zaire , chiefs " indirectly " executed the colonial policies of agrarian capitalism . Unfortunately for the colonial administration , the task was hampered by ideology-dependent core relations in the following ways . Firstly , authentic chiefs and kings sought to remain true to their precolonial requirements which , because it ran against colonial prescriptions and policies , pitted them against the colonial administration until they were forcefully dismissed or sent to prison . Secondly , colonial-appointed chiefs were not always pliant to colonial orders ; themselves deeply marked by lineage core relations , they tended to reproduce them to the displeasure of the colonial administration . Thus , for instance , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock for bride price and the creation of a large rnbari ( subclan ) . Defying the British wish to create a " new " brand of chiefs through school , some of them refused to send their sons to mission/ European schools . In addition , they maintained much of the precolonial political organization. 37 And thirdly , even when appointed chiefs were docile and supported by the coercive apparatus of the colonial state , their task was not always easy . In most cases , direct control over the chiefs ( e.g. , their appointment by the colonial officials ) backfired . In Zaire , for instance , obedience by the subjects was not always forthcoming because the appointment made the chief lose his precolonial aura. 38 Major consequences followed . In terms of colonial policies of capitalist implantation , the impact was negative because policies were not executed by the subjects as expected . And , in many cases , the reaction of the subjects caused colonial officials to reappoint the traditionally legitimate chiefs , thus strengthening the " traditions , " that is , lineage noncapitalist relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell victim to the entrenched ideology-dependent core relations among the Africans themselves . In Kenya , once plots were allotted , Africans maintained " traditional land tenure systems and customary methods . " 39 Those who bought land in the reserves did not apply capitalist methods of management . On the contrary , in most cases , lineage core relations persisted or were reinstated. 40 For instance , despite the smallness of most of the holdings allocated to Africans in Kenyan reserves , they accommodated extended families to the point where the holdings became too small for the owner to make a capitalist living . In the Kikuyu district of Kiambu , for instance , a holding of up to 2.49 acres contained about nine persons . As the size of the holding increased so did the number of the lineage members it supported . Even the larger holdings that had a better chance of creating a landed class relied on lineage relations for their management and labor . Neither land consolidation nor the enclosure movement of the post-Mau Mau period radically changed this situation . " The Kikuyu retain something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , this has remained the rule for all Kenya despite some exceptions in the postcolonial period. 42 Although some big farmers did benefit from the " agrarian revolution , " they did so not from capitalist farming but from their control of the postcolonial state apparatus that makes them land speculators. 43 <p> Given that ( 1 ) a growing mass of landless peasants depend on these big farmers and ( 2 ) the " revolution " never touched most of the small holdings ( only about 12 percent of land for high-value cash crops 44 ) , it is clear that capitalist penetration of Kenyan agriculture remains extremely circumscribed and highly contested by ideology-dependent core relations . Symptomatic of this situation is a study conducted among the Luo in the postcolonial period , which advocates the destruction of the traditional socioeconomic structure and behaviors that impede " rational " production in agriculture . Among the most intractable behaviors deriving from this structure is the expenses devoted to " ancestral cult , rituals , strong belief in magic power and superstition , " lather than to productive ( i.e. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this to " irrationality " and to the fact that " the Luo peasants did not yet recognize the problem of efficient agricultural development . " 45 One recognizes here the classic pitfall . Rather than being a sign of ignorance of efficiency in agriculture , these expenses in rituals best demonstrate the reproducing power of ideology-dependent core relations as they stifle capitalist core relations among the Luo . <p> Of the features of capitalism , the separation of the worker from the capitalist-owned means of production is the most important not because of the sheer fact of the separation , but because this capitalist-worker relationship structures almost all other relations in society . Thus affected , these other relations strengthen capitalism in return , in many different ways . In both Kenya and Zaire , because of the four major instances of the reproduction of the ideology-dependent core relations that neutralized the implantation of capitalism among the African masses , most social relations were not affected by the core capitalist-worker relationship . Unable to strengthen capitalist core relations wherever the latter existed ( e.g. , large farms and especially in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of capitalism to retreat further into their enclave position and to adopt policies that further reduced the chances of capitalist implantation . <p> Space precludes an elaborate analysis of this phenomenon . Suffice it to indicate that the industrial structures in Kenya and Zaire ( as well as in all African countries ) perfectly reflect and are an outcome of this process . Examples include the input-output dislocation generated by the geographical imbalance of the industrial structure dominated by the Nairobi and Mombasa poles in Kenya and the Kinshasa and Katanga poles in Zaire . Exchanges at the production level among these major industrial regions are almost nonexistent . The lack of capitalist commodification in most sectors and regions of the economy , especially the lack of capitalist linkage with peasant ( subsistence ) production , and the reliance of big plantation agriculture on exports ( e.g. , tea , cotton , and coffee ) force local industries to import most of their inputs , especially because the internal lack of integration among manufacturing industries and between manufacturing industries and peasant agriculture left a vacuum that multinational corporations fill . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an outcome of the heroic struggle of ideology-dependent precolonial core relations against capitalism , are fertile ground for what has been incorrectly referred to as " neocolonialism . " Indeed , pseudocapitalism breeds both foreign domination and overpoliticization , the type of politics that characterizes Africa . <p> The situation in agriculture and industry reinforces the reproducing power of the lineage ideology-dependent core relations . Its neutralizing impact is visible as one observes the many African social categories or classes that emerged within this agrarian and industrial pseudocapitalism : peasants/villages , workers , city dwellers , the bureaucrats , and businesspeople . In Kenya as in Zaire , rural dwellers and peasants are affected by capitalism but not marked by it . Rather than disappearing under the influence of capitalism , as some have predicted , 46 peasants have maintained their lineage relations of production . As already indicated , in Kenya , this persistence is seen in the management of land holdings , even though many have become landless . In Zaire and elsewhere , even their involvement in the production of cash crops is through lineage-owned land . Workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most workers have maintained a " double home , " having their social focus ( including their means of subsistence ) in their rural/lineage base. 47 This is manifested through their seasonal migration from the work place to the village ; their return to the village/lineage base when they lose their jobs ; the solid contact with the lineage elders to whom they send a portion of their wages for bride-price and other social functions ; and their participation in sorcery , ancestral cults , and " tribalism . " Like workers and villagers , bureaucrats and businesspeople also maintain , although not always in the same way , a " double home . " They also continue to practice sorcery , ancestral cults and so forth . In between lies the " informal sector , " which is an indication of the people affected by expanded capitalism but controlled by ideology-dependent core relations . These trends can be observed in other African countries. 48 Conclusion : The Choice for Africa 's Future <p> Because the discussion is inspired by central , eastern , and southern African precolonial societies and only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be drawn here . Nevertheless , ample evidence strongly supports the view that expansionist capitalism did not lead to its implantation . I have argued that despite capitalism/imperialism 's responsibility , the structural dynamism of African precolonial societies played a heroic role in making pseudocapitalism by stifling the implantation of capitalism . African precolonial societies were characterized by an absence of class relations , which explained the primacy of lineage and its attendant ideology-dependent core relations . By reproducing the intrinsically noncapitalist relations and developmental path , ideology-dependent core relations and their attendant **27;394;TOOLONG neutralized the means of implanting capitalism . It was ideological routinization that , by reproducing " traditional " social relations , provoked the resistance to earlier attempts at proletarianization ; dictated the position of the opponents to the land privatization policy in Zaire ; stifled the drive toward agrarian capitalism in Kenya ; alerted the colonial subjects to the illegitimacy of the colonial-appointed chiefs ; and forced the type of colonial rule ( mixed or generally indirect ) . By stifling agrarian capitalism , ideology-dependent core relations dictated the limits within which the enclave capitalist/industrial sectors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neutralization of capitalist means of implantation resulted in contradictory and distorted policies , which in turn explain the characteristic features of postcolonial societies , that is , pseudocapitalism . <p> Contrary to the evolutionary " almighty " capitalism thesis in imperialism-inspired theories , the structural dynamism of precolonial societies make African noncapitalist societies and their mode of production a formidable force to reckon with . And rather than their " stagnation , " it is their very positive dynamism and force of reproduction that stifled capitalist implantation . This explanation radically modifies and differs from Hyden 's dualist argument . Although Hyden maintains , as I do , that the African precolonial mode of production is fundamental for any understanding of Africa , he falls back on dualism and evolutionism . The foregoing analysis differs from Hyden 's in four ways . First , unlike Hyden 's " economy of affection , " which remains unexplained in the evolutionary chain , except to define it as a network of support linked by blood/kin ties , this essay has demonstrated that ideology-dependent core relations are a structural outcome of attempts by classless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coercions . Second , contrary to Hyden 's evolutionary claims that the " economy of affection " is stagnant and retards capitalist development , it has been argued here that the structural dynamism of precolonial societies , embodied in their ideology-dependent core relations , traced a different noncapitalist developmental path ( this does not speak to the level of material production reached by African societies ) ; capitalism was neither the desirable nor the converging point for all societies in the world . Third , Hyden 's dualist and evolutionary assumptions make him perceive African precolonial modes of production as transient entities that have been or can be destroyed by capitalism . By contrast , this essay has shown that by tracing a different path of development , structural dynamism of the lineage mode of production does not allow its destruction by capitalism . Fourth , Hyden imputes pseudocapitalism to the stagnation and negative forces of the " economy of affection " and links the latter directly in a cause-effect relation to the contemporary African crisis of political behavior , institutions and policy management . In an evolutionary fashion , capitalism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Hyden as the solution to the African crisis because they would eliminate the economy of affection . In this essay , by contrast , pseudocapitalism is explained by the " positive " dynamism and heroic struggle of precolonial societies vis-a-vis capitalism , and the African crisis is not directly caused by the lineage mode of production ; rather , the crisis is a structural outcome of pseudocapitalism . Therefore , the solution can not be what Hyden proposes . This last point needs some elaboration to shed light on Davidson 's second solution . <p> Pseudocapitalism causes the African contemporary crisis at two levels . Because of the involvement of imperialism in its making , pseudocapitalism leads , as accurately shown by imperialism-inspired theories , to imperialist exploitation and domination with severe economic and political consequences. 49 But pseudocapitalism causes the crisis also , and more so , through the type of class relations , politics , and state that it generates . In other words , African politics and institutions are not the result of the " economy of affection " that directly leads to " clan politics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being commits murder , God ( the creator of that human being ) is not responsible , so too , the lineage mode of production is not the cause of the contemporary African crisis despite its heroic role in making pseudocapitalism . Rather , the crisis is a structural outcome of pseudocapitalism . I have shown elsewhere 50 that because core relations determine the overall political , social , economic , and " cultural " configurations and patterns of change of a society , Africa 's political and socioeconomic crisis results from the distorted core relations under pseudocapitalism . Under capitalism , all social relationships revolve around capitalist core relations . By allowing the " equalization of opportunities "  --  the ideological requirement of liberal democracy  --  the centrality of capitalist core relations makes possible the cardinal rules of democratic rule , including institutional compromise . Under pseudocapitalism , by contrast , capitalist core relations are not central , being both neutralized by and forced to compete with ideology-dependent core relations of pre-colonial societies . Because this situation does not allow the equalization of opportunities , the state is not liberal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even when called " democratic , " leads easily to authoritarianism , open political coercion , highly defensive behavior of power holders , strife , pervasive corruption and generalized socioeconomic deprivation , all the traits that Hyden wrongly imputes to the " economy of affection . " <p> What is , then , the solution for the crisis ? Hyden 's call for capitalism , the bourgeois-led strong state and good governance are a restatement of modernization theory . There is little need to reiterate here that since the 1960s , programs of development devoted to Africa have been patterned after the evolutionary recommendations of modernization/ dualism theory that advocated strong institutions and Western-like economy to replace " stagnant " ones . The policies of the World Bank , International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , and Western and African governments reflect to various degrees these recommendations . The crisis has deepened rather than been solved . In fact , under pseudocapitalism , advocating " more capitalist investments " to solve the crisis leads not to capitalism but to the reinforcement of enclave capitalist sectors , hence , of pseudocapitalism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asian Pacific Rim " miracle " are useless . Policies flowing from imperialism-inspired theories , although not as widely implemented as modernization-inspired ones , have not fared any better . The failure of African " socialist " regimes ( well before the Gorbachev revolution ) is a partial indication . A peculiarity of pseudocapitalism is that the distorted character of its socioeconomic structure , and the generally depressed level of material production , grant tremendous economic and political power and leverage to foreign-owned enclave capitalist sectors . Under these conditions , where foreign actors exert far more economic and political power of dissuasion in African countries than do individual actors in capitalist Western countries , individual national responses to pseudocapitalism , including withdrawing from world capitalism , are bound to fail as has been shown many times . <p> Against this background , one can choose between Davidson 's two solutions about Africa . To solve the African crisis , does one have to " modernize " African precolonial core relations and their attendant institutions , or does one have to invent new ones through the unification , or at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pre-colonial institutions can not be the answer . The reason does not lie in the banal assertion that many of these precolonial traits have been lost and that , in any case , the attraction of modern life makes it impractical to have recourse to them , but in the analysis presented here . Precolonial political institutions , like political institutions everywhere , were an outcome of society 's core relations . They can not be adopted or " modernized " without adopting at the same time the underlying core relations . Because of the already existing pseudocapitalist conditions and the formidable ability of ideology-dependent core relations to neutralize attempts by capitalism to implant itself and to move beyond its already strongly implanted enclave positions , recourse to African pre-colonial institutions ( hence core relations ) is a sure path to perpetuating pseudocapitalism and the crisis . The situation is ironic . Indeed , it is the very positive dynamism ( the heroic struggle it is likely to always wage against capitalism ) , rather than the " stagnation , " of precolonial societies that makes Davidson 's first solution untenable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa through a " maximum force " strategy that can dismantle pseudocapitalism , the structural cause of the crisis . This strategy is Davidson 's second solution , the unification or regional unification of Africa . As a solution , its strength lies in its ability to weaken both imperialism/capitalist core relations and precolonial ideology-dependent core relations and , thus , break the structural conditions that lead to their crisis-ridden union  --  pseudo-capitalism . Because it targets the structural union between imperialism/capitalism and precolonial societies and does not see capitalism and its attendant type of state and institutions as the rites of passage of African " stagnant " societies to development , the unification of Africa radically differs from dualist and evolutionary solutions . <p> There remains , of course , one important question : How would the unification of Africa break the structural union between capitalism and ideology-dependent core relations for the resolution of the crisis ? The question can not be answered in this essay whose main purpose is to provide the theoretical justifications for the rejection of Hyden 's solution and Davidson 's call for precolonial institutions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Africa  --  remains to be done . If the " invention " of Africa requires reinventing it , reinvention passes necessarily through the much-invented and distorted yet silenced precolonial societies ; they must be brought back , not descriptively but analytically , to the center of the debate about Africa 's present and future . The unification of Africa as a strategy of inventing the future of Africa flows from an understanding of African precolonial societies . The challenge for those concerned with Africa 's future is to explore and focus on this strategy . <p>
