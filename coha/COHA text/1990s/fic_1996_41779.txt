When I was a girl I had a place in the stable I 'd go to be alone . I cleaned it of all the spider webs and laid down a layer of fresh straw . When Mother began her travail with Elizabeth , I went there to get away from the sound of her pain . I was seven . After a while , I went back into the house . The midwife , Mary Neff , had arrived , wearing her cape and carrying a large satchel . Mother stood near the window , large as a nightmare in her linen shift , drinking groaning ale from a small tankard . Her long braid hung down to her waist . The dinner board was spread with the " groaning " cakes we 'd spent weeks preparing , with quince and pippin and damson marmalades . There was a goat cheese . Mother thudded the mug and grabbed the mantle . She panted like a dog in July , her knees slightly bent . She had little bits of sweat on her brow . She concentrated hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her hand , Goody Whittier poured a spoonful of betony tonic , that dark , thick liquid that is so vile going down but helps the pain substantially . Mother was in much pain and Mary sent me for some sheep 's wool from the barn . When I returned , Mother was on the bed , propped against a sack of rags . Mary pulled her shift up and pressed the wool to the side of Mother 's swollen belly , saying it would help until the betony did its job . I was disgusted by the ample shock of dark hair in Mother 's private area . Would I get hair there  --  bushy and dark as that ? I stayed quiet and listened to the women talk . <p> " You take a lock of virgin 's hair on any part of her head , and half the age of the woman in travail , " said Mary Neff . " Then you cut it very small to fine powder . Then two ants ' eggs you 've dried in an oven after your bread is drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a powder with the hair , " she continued . " Give this with a quarter pint of red cow 's milk or for want of it give it in strong ale wart . That will serve for a sharp and difficult travail as well as sheep 's fur , " said Mary . " But I used the last of it last night with Goody Swan 's delivery <p> When it was just about time , Mary ran her hand over the large lump of butter I had fetched from the pantry . She scooped a good bit of it in her hand , and rubbed it amply between Mother 's legs . I could see Mother 's opening now , as large as my fist . How long would it be before the little hole my finger fit perfectly into got to be that large ? It frightened me . When Mother screamed I felt hot and dizzy and was afraid I would fall down , so I held the back of a chair . I was sure Mother was going to die . Elizabeth was born with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was immodest . They cut it short , though , so she 'd be good and tight for her husband someday . <p> I pretended Elizabeth was my own . And when she got old enough , we went everywhere together . I wanted to protect her from dangerous things . Each time she tumbled , I was there to kiss the spot she bruised . I taught her which plants were safe to play with and which were not ; where it was safe to go and where she should never stray . When she was older , our favorite thing was to play down at the river . One early summer day we were there and white clouds boiled up over the trees and the water was so blue <p> wanted to eat it . We took off our shoes and waded in . When we climbed out , Elizabeth knocked one of my shoes off the boulder where I 'd left it and it splashed into the water . I lunged after it and snatched it from the current , but the leather was soaked through . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind my skirts but Father noticed and asked me what I was hiding . I produced the wet shoe . His face darkened and he demanded an explanation . A pinprick of spit hit my cheek when he shouted . He made the shoes himself It was an accident , I insisted . We put our shoes carefully on the rock , but Betty slipped . He forbade me to wear shoes for the rest of the week , to learn , he said , more respect for my belongings and their value . Going to milk the cow was the worst torment . Large fists of thistle chewed my feet . By week 's end , my feet were swollen , covered with cuts and scratches , nearly too sore to walk on . On Sabbath , I walked into meeting and people looked away . They would not interfere . They knew Father . After we returned from meeting , he gave me back my shoes . " I hope you 've learned your lesson ; he said . <p> You never knew what would set him off , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd rage and hit Mother or one of us children . We wanted him happy but did n't know how to keep him that way . Sometimes he was happy . I was fearful of Father and would do anything to make him love me . The more he beat me , the harder I tried to please him . But Elizabeth , young , brave Elizabeth , could not accept Father 's cruelty . She had the courage of an adult , not the humility of a child . She refused to do what she was told if she believed the demand unreasonable . Once when Father hit Mother , Elizabeth jumped on his back and pummeled her small fists into his shoulder . He laughed and shrugged her off , sliding her down to the floor . The most frightening encounter , though , was the day he nearly killed her for refusing to follow an order . Had Mother and I not run from the house as he walloped and kicked her , she would surely have expired . That was the only time I was able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her outspokenness , hated her for thinking she did not have to live by Father 's rules , that she could make her own . I certainly had learned how to follow orders . Who did she think she was that she could live as she saw fit ? But another part of me longed to be like her  --  bold enough to speak out though everyone instructed us to be silent . <p> Once , before Elizabeth was born , Father let me sit on his lap  --  I 'm sure he did n't do this with all the others , but I was his first child  --  and he told me a story of England , of a warm day full of sun that touched the leaves on the big tree next to his house , and the wind moved each leaf so it was music made of light . There was a party where the boys and the girls played together , dressed in their nest clothes , and danced around a tree with ribbons . Then he grew stern . " But that was sinful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slide down . He left the house and did n't come back until we were all in bed , including Mother ; I heard him climb in with her . The mattress crackled . He moaned some and breathed heavy as he must have mounted her and done his business . A few minutes later he snored deeply . In the middle of the night he relieved himself ; the stream of piss hit the empty " hourglass " then strayed over the edge and hit the wood floor . <p> In the morning when I lifted it , the pot was sticky . I carried it to the edge of the woods behind the privy and tossed its contents . This was my daily job . In the frozen winter months , I could n't cover the solid waste with a layer of soil and steam rose up in the cold air . <p> One summer day Father piled us all in the wagon and took us to Andover to the Flints ' house where we were allowed to play in the cherry orchard . The branches drooped with fruit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground and lay on their backs with their knees up . We climbed the ladder tipped against a tree and picked as many cherries as we could eat . After a while our fingers and mouths were dark red . I bit half a cherry , picked out the pit , and smeared it across Mother 's lips to make her beautiful , I said . She smiled . We picked raspberries , too , though they were more difficult , the briars reaching at you like pricked arms , pesting your skirts and sleeves and leaving perforated , fiery lines of blood across your skin . Father stayed indoors all day in Mr. Flint 's study and read to us from the Psalms at dusk when we all came in , our skin pink from the sun . <p> He used to lead us in prayer several times during the day . Upon rising . At the noon meal . Before bed . The words tumbled out of his mouth . He told me I would probably burn infinitely in hell but if I prayed hard and often enough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he and Mother were going to die and that we children must take care to guarantee our salvation . Every day when I woke up I wondered if they would still be alive . I was eight years old . I imagined a desert , a pile of sand , a bird taking one grain of sand every ten years : infinity . When Sara Whitaker died  --  she was only my age  --  Father said I , too , could die at any moment . Was I ready to meet my God ? he queried . I was eating an apple at the time and I looked up from it and said yes , looked him right in the eye . But that night when we read Psalms I suddenly pictured my own death , my own rotten and putrid soul smeared like feces across the walls of hell . I began shaking , burst into tears , and wailed . No one could console me . My prayers felt like pieces of wood . <p> I must have been quite young the day I found Mother lying on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge of the eating board . She was lying underneath it and I crawled to her and wanted to make her happy again . I have since asked her about this but she says she does n't remember . She was holding something made of glass in her hand . I believe it was broken and that is why she was crying . Perhaps I only dreamed it , but her grief is vivid as cherry-painted lips . In my memory her delicate hand cups something fragile and lost and I could not comfort her . Maybe it was not glass but something else my memory has transformed into glass , a letter , maybe , or a lace bonnet . <p> One day Elizabeth and I were walking home from the port where we 'd been sent to buy fish and saw Goody Johnson sitting on the stone fence next to the cow pasture . Her shoulders were like heavy boulders . You could tell from her swollen eyes she had been crying . She had a branch of bittersweet in her hand that she kept turning like something with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could hear the crackle of the orange and red berries . She spoke to the cows in front of her in the pasture , shook the sprig of bittersweet at them as a mother does a spoon to a child who 's misbehaving while she 's cooking . She kept saying to the cows , " Never again . Never , do you hear ? " Her voice was high as it is when you talk and cry at the same time . She finally stood up , rubbed her eyes with the back of her hands , and strode down the path that led to their house . I told Elizabeth that was a witch we 'd just seen . We told Mother as soon as we came home . <p> Everybody saw witches everywhere . A neighbor dog jumped on a child 's leg and started pumping and that was evidence . Someone walked by a pigpen and shooed them just for fun because pigs scare so easily and that was a sure sign . The widow Curtis was known as a potion doctress . She healed nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When we had ailments , Mother took us to her house and she walked through her herb garden  --  the fists of herbs planted in orderly beds  --  and plucked something here , another thing there , then took the palmful of ingredients to the shed . She placed them in the stone mortar and crushed them together with the pestle , made a paste . She put this in a mug she filled with well water and added a spoon of sugar . Widow Curtis comforted many ailments  --  sometimes poison ivy  --  with a paste she 'd make and pat on to the raw burning area . <p> Widow Curtis knew too much . She healed people , did God 's work . She was one of the first to dangle on the green , the crisp soles of her boots at eye level a warning to all . It was the doctor who swore against her , worried she would take his patients away . <p> Mother had an herb garden . She used old dry bread and mixed it with sage and onion and mushrooms we collected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's roast then pressed it into the cavity of a chicken or other game . She folded the legs together as if forcing the bird to pray , then wound the string around the ends , to hold it closed and keep its juices in . <p> She gave me some strong tea when I got my monthlies . I held my legs together tight , trying to keep my blood from escaping . It frightened me , seeing a puddle of clotted blood one day in my knickers . I hated myself for such vileness . I left the knickers on the ground next to the privy and went to find Mother . I pulled her to the spot and pointed . She looked and asked me did I know what it was . I had a vague idea from hearing girls talk that it was because in the night I was visited by a witch who cut me . Mother frowned and told me that it had nothing to do with witches . She explained to me it was because now I was able to have children . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that at any time I could and would become pregnant . Each time I had my monthlies , it meant a baby had died in me and was dripping out . <p> Though I had loved the outdoors as a young child , as I grew older , I eventually grew to fear it . If I had counted the days to spring when I could wade in the river , by the time I was a young woman , I was more comfortable within the walls of the house than I was outdoors . Perhaps it was the minister 's weekly evocation of the howling woods and their half-human , half-devil inhabitants that lay beyond our civilized , tamed corner . The savages , as he called them , stole Christian people from their homes , cut out their tongues from their heads and grilled and savored them for supper . Their appetites were voracious . They were creatures of the wild , and the wild was only as far away as the edge of our northwest field . Though for years the Indians had been friendly , coming and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commerce with ease and courtesy , problems with them were now becoming worse . Every year there were a few more men and their wives who built a house in the woods . The Indians appeared at the edge of the forest and watched , devils that they were . One area to the west was already nicely cleared . Someone built a house there , and no sooner had it been built than an Indian claimed it was on his hunting ground . <p> It was about that time the women of Marblehead killed the two Indians . Felicity Whitburn , having married a man from that town , was visiting her parents in Haverhill and told me the story . The Indians had pirated some boats near there and were captured and brought to Marblehead . They were to be handed over to the constable and taken to court in Boston . There had been many raids that year and the women were afraid to sleep in their own houses . Not satisfied the savages would get what they deserved , the women descended on the port . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Felicity , " and handed some around . Others grabbed large pieces of wood from woodpiles , " she continued . " We sent the Englishmen off , beating them with the sticks , and threatening them with the rocks , as they would protect the swarthy heathens . " <p> I was struck by Felicity 's calm voice as she told me the story . She stared off over the water as she spoke , then turned her head toward me . " As we gathered around the two Indian men , " she said , " I could smell their fear , stronger than the salt air . One of them was old and bent at the knee . He looked me right in the eye . The other was our age . We went at them , smashing as hard as we could , and soon made jelly of them . Someone started tearing at the red flesh and soon we all were pulling it from their bones with our fingers . Charity produced a knife and carved off their heads . We carried them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood blossomed and the marsh grass scratched the Tune night . Lightning bugs were just starting to appear <p> I was appalled at her gruesome poetry , at the revolting account , but knew as well as anyone these devils needed to be wiped out . <p> One incident after another with the Indians occurred and eventually every able-bodied man in Haverhill was given a gun and plenty of ammunition . One of these men was Thomas , whom I 'd first seen at a town meeting where the eldermen were deciding what to do about the Indian problem . ( Though of course we were not allowed to say anything , women could go and listen at meetings . ) It was February and the room was close , the air thick with smoke and the odor of so many bodies . The people in that room were nervous about the situation and the air stank of it . The men decided that the meeting house should be fortified  --  they would put in portholes and strengthen the walls . They would burn the old brush and top wood on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After the meeting ended , as I was dragging my heavy skirts across the snow , Thomas Dustin came up to me and asked me was I afraid of the Indians . I said of course I was , as any Christian soul might be , except those praying Indians who had allowed themselves to be educated and see the proper way to live . " Did you see the one who dumped his basket of fish on the common a few weeks back ? " he asked . <p> I did not , I answered , but of course we 'd all heard of it . John Littleale passed by us and nodded a greeting . He was a silent man . From a family of thirteen children , Littleale had decided to live on his own in the woods , undoubtedly up to something evil . The town countenanced it for some time , but finally ordered him to move into town and live with a family or be sent to labor in a prison in Hampton . <p> As I walked home I decided Thomas Dustin would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was aiming toward was me for a wife I was not against the notion . He courted me for several months , whispering when we were together , as if the things he had to tell me about our future life together were so gorgeous , so precious and exquisite , that to say them too loud would taint them . He had just claimed a track of land in the wilderness about two miles out from the common and needed me to live there with him . My only hesitation was it meant living in the wild . I would be an hour 's walk from my family and would only see them occasionally . Worst of all , we would be in the howling , prowling wild , where every leaf 's movement suggested a heathen was hiding , lurking , staring out at us . The vulgar people were known to lurk and spy . <p> We were married the following year . <p>
