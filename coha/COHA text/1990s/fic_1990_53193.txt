After the protests began , I started running on the beach . I went up every day after work , took off my long sleeves and concealing skirts , slid into nylon shorts and a tanktop . Then I ran . Two kilometers north along the curve of the beach , followed by a swim in the warm , enervating sea . The run back was always the hardest part , the tropical sun fierce even at the end of a day , sweat stinging my eyes , raising a salty layer on my face . The sand beneath my feet was as fine as dust , and the sea stretched out in a calm blue line until it met the horizon . Gradually the resort hotel came back in sight , surrounded by palm trees and thatched beach umbrellas . Plump tourists lay under these , turning over often , turning red . <p> For the last hundred meters or so I concentrated on the archway where I always stopped . It was a strange structure , standing alone where the coconut palms met the beach , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hotel 's cool interior . Your Gateway to Paradise was written on both sides of the arch in scrolling letters , a puzzling claim that encompassed either the hotel or the sea , depending on where you stood . Tourists often chose it as a backdrop for their photos , and once I 'd heard a man joke that you could n't lose  --  according to the sign , paradise was everywhere . What he said surprised me , because I 'd always seen it another way . No matter where you stood , paradise seemed to be the place you no longer were . <p> When I reached the first of the umbrellas a woman lying under one called out to me . She sat up , reaching back to fasten the top of her bathing suit . She was nearly sixty , I guessed , with blond hair faded to the color of sand . She was pale and waistless , with hips that melted into her chest . Nonetheless , she was wearing one of the tiniest bikinis on the beach . She spoke English flawed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bright batik caftan she was pulling over her head . <p> " Excuse me , please , ' she said , emerging from the cloth . " But could you take a picture of me ? It is so beautiful , and my husband is inside with a terrible sunburn . " She paused then , intent on adjusting the short flowing sleeves . " You do speak English , do n't you ? " she added , looking up . <p> I told her that I did . ' What would you like ? " I asked . " A sea background , or the hotel ? " <p> " Oh , I want to get these trees in , certainly , and some of the hotel behind me , if you can . Just flick that small lever there , then push the button . All right ? Are you ready ? " <p> I took two pictures of her  --  standing like a bright flag in front of the subdued colors , sand and wood and deep tropical green . <p> " Thank you , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are you vacationing here , too ? " <p> " Actually , " I said , " I live here . In town , I mean . I come out here to run , that 's all . " <p> " You live here ? How wonderful for you ! " She sat back down on the beach chair and motioned for me to take the empty one next to her . " Lucky , lucky you , " she said , " to live in this paradise . " <p> I smiled and did n't contradict her , but I was thinking of the past week , the taunts of my students as I made my way from class to class , the threatening letters in my mailbox , the chaos and violation of vandals in my house . The protests had their source in colonial history , and in the political events of another Muslim country thousands of miles away . But I was an American woman , living alone , and therefore an easy target . That 's why I 'd chosen this beach , with its languid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't blame my students , not really . They were young Malay boys pulled from their fishing villages , sent to schools in the city and then abroad . In their villages life moved to the rhythm of calls to prayer , of coconuts falling from the trees into sand . The cities were a shock to them , full of evidence of the colonial past , pullulating with a racial and religious mix they 'd never imagined : Portuguese and British , Chinese and Indians . Christians , Sikhs , Tamils , Hindus , and Buddhists  --  the cities denied that Islam was the only way . Each year the new students came in , innocent and eager . I watched their confusion grow , watched the Muslim teachers fire them with an angry pride . Watched as their religion became a tool of political expression . These young boys , how quickly they began to hate ! They protested , marching on hot sidewalks , breaking the glass of city windows , denouncing anyone who was different than themselves . All the time , in the heat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be dreaming of the ocean as it swept the beaches clean . <p> The German woman had taken some cream from her bag and was rubbing it into her thick pink calves . <p> " Do you know , " she said , half a century . My father was Dutch , and it was a Dutch colony . My mother was German . We had the most lovely house there  --  big airy rooms and a cool verandah all around . " <p> " How long were you there ? " I asked , suddenly curious . <p> " Oh , until I was a young woman , " she said . " That 's when our troubles began . As a child I could go anywhere , you know . We never mixed , of course , though I had a local girl for a nanny , and I wo n't forget how kind she was . She had long black braids down her back , and she used to take a bath in the river , wearing her sarong . I thought she was beautiful . I imagined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But then the uprisings started . I remember it was just after my fifteenth birthday , because I had a new dress , and I was out walking to the Club in it . You ca n't imagine how beautiful it was , the lightest blue cotton with a white inset lace . I had a white eyelet parasol as well . It was like this , of course , " she said , gesturing to the sea and meaning the weather . " It was always so hot . That 's why I was out . I was going to have an ice . " <p> She paused , remembering . Her blue eyes were still bright in their crinkled flesh , and it was possible to imagine her much younger , dressed in clothes that were calculated to set off those azure eyes , her pale , pale skin . She went on , as if she had read my mind . <p> " Of course , " she said , " we did n't take the sun in those days . We had to be very careful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different world , now . " <p> " It certainly is , " I agreed . <p> " But I was telling you of the uprisings . You see , there I was walking , calm as could be , when I heard these voices starting behind me . I could n't understand , of course , I did n't speak more than a few words of their language , but I could certainly feel that something unpleasant was going to happen . I stood up tall  --  that 's what my father always told us to do  --  and walked straight on . Then something hit me , right here . " She turned slightly , and placed her hand on the back of one firm hip . " It was a tomato . Of course it was overripe . They threw other things , too . There was a guava , half-rotten and covered with ants , that hit my neck . I can still feel the way they crawled down my back . They even threw a durian , and you know how that smells . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to the Club . My father said later that he was very proud . But of course , my lovely dress was absolutely ruined . And that day was only the beginning . " <p> She called to the waiter . He was wearing black trousers and a white jacket , and his leather shoes slipped against the sand as he walked . <p> " Do you want a drink ? " she asked . " Let me get you a drink . Please bring us two watermelon ices , " she said . <p> The waiter was a friend of mine . We often spoke as I entered the hotel , and he taught me words in his language . Very good , he 'd say , eyes shining . You speak my language very well . He was thirty-five , and living far away from his wife and son . He 'd been trained as an engineer , but times were bad , and this was the only job he could get . Every month he sent money home . He liked to stand at the edge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now I thanked him , using words he had taught me himself , but though he smiled , he would n't catch my eye . <p> " There , " she said . She raised her pink glass to mine . <p> " What happened next ? " I asked , annoyed with myself for being so interested in this woman , whom I disliked . <p> " Things went from bad to worse , " she said . " After some time we could n't even leave our houses . Eventually the strain was too much . My father resigned his post and took us all home . Oh , it was terribly hard for us . We were suddenly quite poor , you see , living in my grandmother 's house . And that first winter I was never warm . Then the war began . All those years , my whole life , I 've dreamed of beaches like this . But it 's only now that I 've been able to come back . Yes , you 're a very lucky girl , living in a place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Yes , I guess I am . " <p> Then , despite myself , I told her some of the things that had happened . I was lonely , I suppose . It had been a long time since I 'd spoken my own language to anyone . I was just realizing that I 'd have to leave this place , this country I 'd come to so naively , with such good intentions . I talked too much , seeking a sympathetic ear , but she hardly listened , interrupting me after a minute with a wave of her hand in the air . <p> " Oh that , " she said . " That sort of thing happens everywhere , these days . Take Germany , for example . We have all those Turks , so many of them just pouring in . They build their mosques , they settle down , and then they start demanding things . Protest after protest . Why , there 's terrible unemployment going on now . My own grandson ca n't get a position . But he ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they have a free apartment and all the aid they like , and just for sitting around doing nothing . It 's a terrible thing when it 's better to be an immigrant than to be a natural-born citizen of your own country . " <p> I wanted to say , Perhaps that 's why those people threw tomatoes at you , do n't you think ? I imagined the splash of pulpy red against her dress , the long gluey stain of durian . It would be a satisfaction , I could see that , to identify your target , to deface an arrogant back . <p> " Excuse me , " I said . " Thank you for the drink . " I left her in mid-sentence , before she could even say goodbye . <p> It was nearly sunset , and everything was very calm . Most of the sunbathers had gone in to dress for dinner , and the hotel lights were beginning to come on . The pool glowed like a turquoise fruit , and people moved around it to set up the barbecue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the night . Low and colorful , they curved into the water like crescent moons . The fishermen were very brown and wore sarongs . They tied their hair back in scarves like pirates . In the two years I 'd been here I 'd learned their language , learned their ways . If I went in the blue-dusk beach to talk with them , they 'd probably give me some fish , or invite me home for dinner . My neighbors had been shocked when they saw what was done to my house . Do n't believe it , they said , helping me to scrub my floor , gathering broken cups and glasses with their worn brown fingers , washing the vile words off the plank walls . They do n't mean this , it 's only children , they do n't know any better . Children , I thought , remembering my students , who looked at me through sullen eyes and saw , not me , but the fat pale woman from history . <p> In the tropics the darkness comes suddenly and completely . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powdery sand until the night blurred the absolute parameters of sea and land . On one side the hotel , polished with light , looked like a great boat . On the other side the fishermen floated , holding lamps , and farther out the squid boats were lit with bright bare bulbs . They were different worlds , but in the darkness it seemed the sea was everywhere , drawing the buildings and boats together in a confluence of intricate , floating lanterns . <p> It was an illusion , of course . Still , I stood there for a long time , until the last boat came in , until dinner was served by the pool . Until the tide turned and came rushing back around my feet . I was not an aging European woman , my dreams rooted in a lost colony . But I was not a fisherman either . Like my students I was not one thing or another , but unlike them I would have to leave . It must have been hours that I stood there , feeling the tide wash around my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that beach near paradise and listened to the waves . <p> <p> By Kim Edwards <p>
