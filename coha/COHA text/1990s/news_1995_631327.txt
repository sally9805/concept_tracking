<p> The story goes like this : At the Westwood Nursing Home at Touhy and Western , everybody complained about the chicken soup . So the female residents of the kosher home took matters into their own hands . They ventured into the kitchen , in an organized rotation , to make real chicken soup . <p> The result ? No one was happy with any bowl of soup except the woman who made it . <p> " True story , " said June Lefkovitz of Northbrook , a chicken-soup maker throughout her 49-year marriage to her husband , Irving , one of the nursing home 's former owners . <p> Lefkovitz tells the story to illustrate a bigger truth : Folks are proprietary about chicken soup . Chicken soup  --  so comforting , so healing and so universal  --  is also imperfect . Imperfect , that is , unless you or your mother or grandmother made it . <p> Let 's establish this before we proceed . There are no chicken soup experts . Or , put another way , everybody 's an expert . <p> Talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you they already know all the facts : that chicken soup heals body and spirit , that it is greater than the sum of its parts , that everyone has the best recipe , and that chicken soup is connected to stories and people and is as varied as those stories and people . <p> This is the time of year when mothers  --  Jewish , Polish , Chinese and all other ethnic persuasions  --  crank up the stove . The slow simmer of chicken , water and a cornucopia of other magical ingredients produces a golden elixir . <p> " I make it all year , " said Lefkovitz , who spends half the year in Florida but still remembers how winter and the cold season increase the demand for chicken soup.Lefkovitz , like everyone else , recites her formula " from my head . " No one who really makes chicken soup has a written recipe . What happens , she says , is you add to and take away from every formula until " you get it the way you want . " <p> Lefkovitz 's soup is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( a kosher brand ) bouillon . Chicken-soup makers , not unlike those fabled stone-soup makers , " take from others , " Lefkovitz said , and the chicken bouillon trick is co-opted from a friend 's recipe . She also adds vegetables : carrots , onion , parsnip or dill and sliced garlic . The recipe sounds remarkably similar to New York food writer Mimi Sheraton 's favorite soup ( for that recipe , turn to Page 10 ) . <p> Then , " I do n't boil it heavy , " said Lefkovitz , preferring the slow simmer that Sheraton calls a " smile "  --  " a sort of twinkling , trembly , faint rippling just below the surface . " The smile releases a substance called osmazome , writes Sheraton , which yields a flavor that hard boiling does not . Furthermore , hard boiling clouds the soup and toughens the chicken meat . <p> Many cooks insist that their own soup is nothing special , but that may be motivated more by the desire to keep the recipe and technique a secret than by real humility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use a whole , freshly killed chicken and to cook the broth very slowly with scallions and slices of ginger , two ingredients loaded with immunity-boosting compounds that science is just discovering . <p> She may or may not tell you about all the other ingredients , important for enhancing the flavor and crucial for their healing properties : shiitake mushrooms , red jujubes ( a dried fruit ) , dried immature bamboo shoots , and herbs and seeds she may seek out from her herbalist in Chinatown . <p> Slow cooking , she would say , echoing the Jewish grandmother , keeps the broth clear , while the whole chicken she insists on  --  with feet and head attached  --  is exactly the sort Sheraton writes about in describing Old World Jewish cooking . <p> The Chinese grandmother might , as a modern woman , slow-cook the soup in a Crock-Pot , but more important , she is creating it from memories of special dinners long past . <p> Similarly , Kay Kulakowski of Prospect Heights re-creates the chicken soup she grew up eating in Poland . She has passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wheeling . Together they talk you through the soup as they remember it from Poland and as it has evolved in their family . <p> " You use a chicken , maybe half a chicken and beef bones , " Kulakowki begins , and goes on to describe a recipe whose outlines resemble those of many recipes we have heard and read . Kulakowski uses parsley roots in hers ( as does Sheraton ) , and roasts the onion over an open , low flame about <p> five minutes on the stove top before adding it to the soup as it cooks . <p> Chicken soup is economical , she says , because it becomes a second , different meal the next day ; with the addition of vegetables , barley or other ingredients , you have a whole new soup . <p> Without a doubt , chicken soup heals , Kulakowski pointed out . " It 's good if you 're feeling bad , " she said . " We have it for colds . <p> " And , " she added , " if you have a hangover . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soup you drink . <p> My favorite chicken soup <p> Makes 6 to 8 servings <p> 1 ( 5- to 6-pound ) fowl , preferably fresh-killed , or 7 to 8 pounds broiling or frying chickens , with neck and all giblets except liver <p> Veal knuckle bone ( optional ) <p> 10 to 12 cups water , or more as needed <p> 2 large carrots , scraped and quartered <p> 2 celery stalks with leaves , whole or chopped <p> 1 medium onion <p> 3 Italian parsley sprigs <p> 1 small parsnip , scraped and cut in half <p> 1/2 small celery root ( celeriac ) , peeled <p> 1 ( 2- to 3-inch ) length of parsley root ( petrouchka ) , scraped and cut in half <p> 1 medium leek ( green and white parts ) , split and well-washed <p> Salt and white pepper , to taste <p> Pinch of sugar , if needed <p> Optional garnishes : <p> Minced fresh parsley and/or dill <p> 1 or 2 tablespoons cooked green peas per serving <p> 1/4 cup cooked rice per serving <p> Matzo balls or kreplach ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be cooked whole , if the pot is large enough , or quartered .

In El Cajon , Calif. , near San Diego , Mike Hall , president of Borrego Solar Systems , has $90 million in contracts coming down the pipeline at him this year . The company recently sold its residential solar division -- little new-housing construction means no real market for residential solar -- and raised $14 million in venture funding to help it transition to a broader energy technology company that will focus on developing low-cost design systems and installation techniques for businesses and government . With new locations in New York , New Jersey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ develop new forms of photovoltaic technology but also the bodies on the ground to deploy it . Ask what shape technology jobs will take in the post-recession economy , and you 'll learn that they increasingly will look like the ones Borrego needs to fill . Indeed , jobs in green tech will be driving the country 's economic engine -- once the capital markets loosen and money from President Barack Obama 's American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 begins to flow . " I think the green-tech sector is going to see significant job growth late in the third quarter of this year and into next year once a lot of the aspects of the stimulus package trickle down to projects and companies , " Hall says . More than $70 billion of the funds provided by the act will go to energy-related investment , making clean tech the low-hanging fruit of job development . Of that $70 billion , $11 billion is set for modernizing the electrical grid , $2 billion for developing efficient batteries , $2.5 billion for renewable-energy research , and $500 million for training workers for jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ According to the job-search website Simply Hired , the green-tech sector is trending up : Between July 2007 and January 2009 , green-tech hiring increased by 31 percent . By 2010 , it 's expected that there will be 5.8 million jobs in the green sector and , by 2020 , 6.9 million . What are the green jobs ? It 's a wide-ranging field that includes any activity that generates electricity using renewable sources . That means everything from agriculture ( turning corn or soy into fuel ) to manufacturing ( producing goods used in renewable power ) to construction ( installing energy-efficient products ) . Oh , yeah , the green economy will need plenty of lawyers , too . Dion Lim , president of Simply Hired , says that in the near future , elusive capital may hamper job creation . In Silicon Valley , Solyndra , a maker of solar panels , just received a $535 million loan guarantee from the federal government to finance a factory that would employ 1,000 people . But Solyndra , which made headlines nationwide with the announcement in March of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule . Job creation " will be a big struggle in the short term because access to capital is one of the major blockages to entrepreneurs ' being able to generate significant jobs . . . I ca n't walk out of a bank with a $200 million loan when they do n't have the capital , " Lim says . Still , companies are positioning themselves to take advantage of the stimulus funds , and states are following suit . Peter Adriaens , an environmental engineering and business professor with the Zell Lurie Institute for Entrepreneurial Studies at the University of Michigan , believes that jobs lost in the flagging auto industry can be replaced with jobs in green tech , jobs that carry salaries capable of supporting a family and creating a good livelihood . " I think it would behoove everyone to keep an eye on where the multiples are in clean tech , because they 're much better than people think they are , " Adriaens says . " People are worried about the auto industry and the value chain . . . but that can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these nascent industries . " And given the jobless rate , the sooner the better .
