 | his neurolink . It was a connection to the quarx . Alien as datanet. /Link in and ask me questions , / the quarx said softly . Nodding to himself , swallowing , feeling a little ashamed for his anger , and wanting desperately for this to be more than he thought it possibly could be , he reached out with his thought toward the pulsing panel , and he plugged in , and his remaining outward senses fell away as he was fully enclosed by darkness , but a darkness filled with energy .. . ? **18;0;mode-level /Are you here ? / he whispered in astonishment . Ask me what you want to know . It was the quarx 's voice , but altered . . . deeper and more resonant , exactly like an information-source replying through the datanet . He sighed with unexpected pleasure , and a tremendous feeling of need welled up and then as quickly ebbed away . Dizzily , he whispered , /I want to know where you came from and why . And I want to know exactly what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you like me to begin ? He shrugged mentally . /At the beginning , I guess. / Of time ? I was n't there . He began to retort angrily , then realized that the quarx was attempting humor , attempting to lighten things up ; and despite himself , he chuckled a little . /All right , you can start later than that . Let 's stick to your personal lifetime . Unless , of course , you 're really long-lived , in which case , you can start by telling what you want with me , and work backwards. / There was a moment of uneasy silence .  | I 'm . . . no . . . not long-lived , certainly not in the way you 're thinking . It 's true I was . . . in a sense .. . alive , millions of years ago , but that 's . . . well .. . because I was in stasis in the translator ... Bandicut tried to follow that , frowning . /You 're not long-lived , but you were alive  --  in a sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the millions of years do n't count , you see , because of the stasis . . . whereas , to understand a quarxian life cycle , the first thing you need to ask Is ... Bandicut felt himself sliding toward mental quicksand , and interrupted , /All right , wait ! How about if you explain ill that later. / He paused , sensing the quarx 's discomfiture at the interruption . /Let 's start with the present , and this mission " of yours . What is it you 're planning to do here ? W hat is this about Earth and some sort of danger ? / The quarx hesitated , as though uncomfortable with the question . Bandicut began to grow impatient , but before he could ask why , the quarx finally spoke . You see . . . that 's difficult to explain fully just now , because I do n't have all of the information yet . The first thing I must do is gather additional data for the translator to process ... /Gather data ? / Bandicut asked suspiciously , visions of alien @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assure you . Not from us , anyway . There may , indeed , be something heading for your home planet ; but , I believe , it 's more in the na-y ure of cosmic debris  --  and it is my job , and the trans-lator 's , to identify that hazard and act to prevent it from striking . With your help , of course ...  | /Of course , / Bandicut muttered . /What sort of help ? And what kind of debris are we talking about ? / Well . . . I ca n't give you the specifics on the debris until we have the rest of that data . I can guess , but /Guess ? / Bandicut felt a rush of anger . /Quit bullshitting me , Charlie , or I 'm going to go to our company quack , Dr. Switzer , and have him cut you out with a knife ! / He immediately sensed the quarx 's affront . I 'm not " bullshitting " you , and I thought you understood that I have no physical presence as you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harm you , not me . Bandicut sighed in annoyance. /Look , that was just another figure of speech , okay ? Now , do you want to continue ? / Oh . Very well . Here is what I was given : a picture of small , orbital-dynamical shifts somewhere in your solar system , leading to the potential hazard . I suspect it 's some sort of sizable interplanetary rubble . Listen , John , you must understand that I 'm not ... " sitting in the left-hand seat " on this one , as you pilot-types would say . So I ca n't /Then who is sitting in the left-hand seat ? / Bandicut interrupted . The translator . And once it has the data it needs to positively identify the danger . . . it will pass that information on to me . And I 'll pass it on to you . Bandicut thought he sensed a certain hesitation in the quarx 's voice . /Wait just a minute , / he said . /Who controls the translator ? You do , right ? / Me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sensed an eruption of troubled feelings in the quarx. /You mean there 's someone else here ? Damn it , I knew it ? / John , no . It 's not what you 're thinking . It 's just the translator and me , and the translator is just a machine . But it 's . . . sent by others who are , I assure you , very far away . And I 've never known it to attempt anything that was n't . . . helpful to those it visited . It seemed to Bandicut that the quarx was more than a little hesitant when it spoke about the translator . He wondered why . /Well , that does n't sound like such a big deal ? identifying some space rubble , / he said cautiously . /But I have to say , you do n't sound entirely convinced about it yourself. / What ? No , no  --  the translator is trustworthy . But it 's not . . . always easy . . . to do what it wants , is the problem . Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some background ? /Is n't that what I 've been asking for ? / I thought you ... never mind . Just watch , and listen ... ? **18;20;mode-level ? .. . The information swirled by like a churning white-water rapids , and it seemed that all he could do was sample here and t here , and file for future analysis . But that was difficult ; perhaps he would be better off just jumping in and riding downstream with the flow .. . It was millions of years ago , just as human science had surmised , that an orphaned body later to be named Triton had fallen into the gravitational influence of the solar system . Charlie and his translator were aboard , though the quarx was in stasis-sleep , and would remain that way for  | millennia yet to come , until awakened by the translator . But the translator never slept . It probed ceaselessly , monitoring the inner solar system and the evolution of sentient life on the third planet , unmistakably marked by first gradual ? then abrupt  --  transformations of its biosphere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ translator recorded them , from volcanoes to atomic explosions to the migrations of small vessels out of the atmosphere . It studied events of all kinds , whether apparently significant or not , and in its own methodical way , drew conclusions about the events it had studied . Much of what Charlie knew , he had learned directly from the translator . Since his awakening , he had viewed years of reruns of Earth television , all recorded by the translator in that window of time when TV signals had been broadcast into space , before laser and opfiber transmission had mostly ended the free show . He owed much of his knowledge of human culture to such broadcasts . He 'd also gleaned hints of what it was he was doing here , what purpose he was intended to serve . Bandicut could only register astonishment : how could the quarx not know his own mission ? But it was not his first , far from it , and he had yet to fully understand a mission prior to undertaking it . The other thing that astonished Bandicut , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stream , was that the quarx really did n't know how the translator performed many of the feats in which the quarx himself was a participant . Surely , if he 'd been alive in the translator for millions of years , did n't he have to know how it worked ? No no no , whispered a quarxly voice , almost lost in the undercurrent . I 'm not the master of that science . The quarx knew how to use the translator , but it was not actually his machine , not a quarxly machine at all . But where . . . how had Charlie come to be in such a time and place ... ? p 75 ? shift The images changed like a whirlpool yawning . There were glimpses of dozens of worlds , dozens of hosts in quarxly lives past . . . it was like a flickering of holocards ... and then the image settled , and filled with the sounds and impressions of other beings , alien beings , living on this very moon . The beings who had left the metal deposits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and activities an incomprehensible murmur . For an instant Bandicut thought , with a flash of alarm , that they were here on Triton now -- and then he realized that this scene was far , far in the past , long before Triton had ever come to the solar system . It was the moon as it had been , not just in the past , but so deep in the past that primitive life had scarcely yet evolved on Earth . This was Triton eons ago , in another star system , another reality . It was Triton at war . In frightening silence , he watched as long plumes of light splashed languidly across the ruined landscape of a nearby planetary body , the mother world . He was aware that the light beams came from the surface of Triton , and they were no mining lasers . They were weapons , terrible weapons , and they were raining devastation upon their homeworld . The plumes of destruction flowed and surged over the planet 's surface like tides , and the civilization beneath them crumbled , melted , evaporated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : battle raged in space , as well  --  between the planet and its moon , and on the surface of the moon . Spaceships tumbled past one another , lancing each other into debris . Streams of fire swept over the surface of the moon , boiling away its atmosphere and reducing miracles of technology to molten slag . The footsteps were gone now ; it all happened in silence . But he imagined that he could hear the screams of dying beings echoing across the emptiness of space .  | There was no escape , none at all  --  except down into the buried , shielded translator , the place from which the quarx had first emerged in his failed , futile effort to prevent this tragedy from happening . Though damaged and unable to escape , the translator could probably survive the dark and the cold to come , if it could just survive this last terrible onslaught of violence . The quarx was now slipping downward through the deep darkness of ice , into the machine that might bear him through eons , and perhaps an eternity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distantly , the final tremendous explosions that vaporized the last living beings on the surface and hurled the moon out of orbit , out of its star system , and into the somber and lonely silence of interstellar space . With those explosions had come the final , bitter end to this war , and to the last of those who had fought it . The quarx drifted off into a timeless , dreamless stasissleep . His final thoughts were darkened with grief . Where he was bound now , he had no idea . But he knew it could take longer than the lifetime of his own race to reach his next destination . And while he slept , the translator repaired itself . Would he ever see another quarx ? All he really knew for certain was that his life had changed forever , yet again . Bandicut 's whisper was a part of the blurred datastream . My God , is this your memory ? Did you really live through this ? Were those your people who died ? Not my people , no . For a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past .. . ? shift The battle images spun swirling away , the whirlpool of memory displaced by new images of Triton in orbit around the cold , cerulean planet Neptune . The heat of its capture had melted most of the moon , causing all the stone and metal in its crust to sink to the core ; but some of that energy had been harnessed by the translator , and it , with some of the metal remnants of the alien civilization , had erupted  | back upward to the surface in a great convective flow as Triton cooled . With awakening , for the quarx , there was a sense that certain memories were faded or perhaps had been lost , that some very important work had gone unfinished , that some failure had to be rectified , some wrong atoned for , some need fulfilled . There was a reverberating memory that this was how it always felt to awaken . The quarx felt a deep loneliness and longing , but also a sudden new urgency . Here was a new place and time , a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had come into being while he had slept . And humanity had found its way to Triton , and would soon discover the translator . Who were they , these humans  --  and were they dangerous ? Would one of them make a suitable host and companion ? Were they dangerous ? Why had the translator waited so long to wake him ? It had served him well , and protected him  --  but it was not life to be trapped in that machine forever . How he longed to be free of its bonds  --  to grow , to taste again the reality of life with another ! But it was not to be easy ; there was something that had to be done here  --  a matter of life and death , not just for him , but for the beings of this solar system . He did not know yet what it was , but he knew that that was why he had been awakened , and he knew that it would be risky and costly , because it always was . He had much to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he listened to humanity and came to know their languages and some of their ways . He watched their entertainment and studied their history through what he could capture of their datanet . He struggled to get to know a race that sometimes made him shudder with fear . Fear ... ? They were a dangerous species , humanity . Of course , most sentient species were ; and with that thought came another shudder .  | Do you fear all sentient species ? whispered Bandicut . Watch the datastream , you 're missing too much , was the whispered answer . The quarx still had much to learn , even as he paid particular attention to a survey pilot named Bandicut who was stumbling along in a rare but promising condition known as silence-fugue , toward a potential meeting . The translator hinted that time was probably growing short , and this person seemed the most promising of an uncertain lot .. . ? **18;40;mode-level The datastream changed , and most of it diverted away , while a single , bright connection remained . /Are you saying that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? drew me in ? ? / I did n't say that exactly . /But you knew a lot about me already , and you sure as hell opened the ground under my feet ! / Well . . . yes . . . /So you knew I was coming ? / I sensed . . . yes . . . when I am in the translator , it enables me a certain degree of ... what you would probably call telepathic scanning . It is nothing like the intimate contact that we have now . It is more like a . . . radar sweep . /Radar sweep ? And are you still doing this ? Are you probing the other people here ? / I ca n't , not outside of the translator . Except in a limited way , when you physically touch someone , or something . p 79 Bandicut remembered Napoleon . /Like the robot , you mean ? / Yes . Bandicut was silent for a time , trying to absorb all that the quarx had told him . /Charlie , / he said finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life traveling around the galaxy trying to bail civilizations out of trouble ? Because that 's what it sounds like . . . / Well , yes  --  I mean , no ! Not always whole civilizations ... Bandicut blinked . /Good God , but you mean it 's true ? Is that what you do ? It sounds like . . . I mean , do n't you .. . have a life of your own to live ? / He swallowed , and realized that a shadow of grief seemed to have come across Charlie with his words . /I 'm sorry , look , I did n't mean . . . if I said something . . . / The quarx spoke , but as though from a great distance . It 's not ... so bad , really . It has its own rewards , you know . /Charlie ? / He hesitated , and after a moment , the quarx drew back toward him , speaking softly . It is true that I am on a ... journey , John Bandicut . And that I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what purpose . Or whether I will ever return ... to my own kind . Or even if they are ? The quarx paused . /What ? / Bandicut asked . /Alive , or something ? / Yes . /Jesus ... I 'm sorry . I did n't mean to ? / It 's been a long journey , John . I 've seen more than one civilization fall , and I 've seen some saved ,  | and the latter way is better . I 'd like to help save yours , if I can . Bandicut was silent . They had to save the Earth , the quarx had said . And he wanted Bandicut 's help . /You want to , uh , tell me a little more about that ? / he asked at last . I 'll try . Let 's start with a question . How much do you know about chaos ? /How do you mean ? Randomness , disorder , entropy ? / No , I mean the science of chaos . /Oh . Not too much . What should I know about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and waves , curling around him like breakers rolling in upon a shore .. . The dynamical theories of chaos were the only practical means of describing many kinds of natural events , of illuminating past and present patterns , and of predicting future patterns of similar events . Among the subjects described by chaos theory were fluid turbulence , atmospheric weather patterns , the movements of particles , of individual lives , of planetary bodies in orbit . . . and even the social forces that swirled through crisis upon crisis in the history of any civilization , including Earth 's . It was the last two of these subjects that had drawn the sharpest attention of the translator . It was the study of the chaotic patterns of orbital resonance in the solar system that made the translator suspect , long ago , that the Earth might one day be in trouble . How 's that ? whispered Bandicut . Let the stream carry you , and just try to follow , murmured the quarx . The human science of chaos was far too immature , even in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the appropriate data ; and even the translator , with its vastly more powerful chaos-calculator , was still working furiously , refining and analyzing , drawing together vague and shadowy possibilities into a picture that soon would make clear exactly what would go wrong , and where .. . and what must be done .. . Charlie ... ? I 'm not .. . Take an example , murmured the quarx . Motions of particles in a cloud of smoke  --  or in the rings around a planet , a planet such as Neptune , or Saturn . All the particles followed known physical laws of motion . But the motions were too hopelessly complex , viewed from a perspective of close detail , for predictions of any individual particle 's motion to be useful . The tiniest perturbation of an orbit in one place could cause a drastic change in a particle 's path elsewhere ; and every particle exerted some degree of force on every other particle , so if you were trying to predict a particle 's path with any precision , taking into account the millions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  unless you employed truly advanced chaos dynamics , such as the calculations used by the translator . And even then , working out general patterns of orbital resonance and the stability and instability of orbits was one thing , but the raw-data requirement for tracking where one individual particle might get flung out of its orbit like a bullet was truly staggering , and best represented this way : An image flicked into existence , showing a series of hollow , transparent , concentric tori , colored various shades of green , blue , orange , and red . Waves of distortion began rippling through the donuts , and then kinks appeared as resonant instabilities , and then the tori opened up like onion shells and twisted like bizarre Mobius strips , and shredded into four-dimensional ferns .. . I am not following this , not at all ?  | ? **18;80;mode-level The image vanished , and Bandicut let out a long breath . /Now , that sure was helpful. / He sensed frustration coming from the quarx . I do n't expect you to follow the actual math , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general outline of the problem , and the solution process . The translator , to put it very simply , is making n-dimensional phase-space analyses of the movements of objects in your solar system ... /That 's putting it simply ? ? / Bandicut asked , but the quarx continued without missing a beat . . . . including those at the outer periphery , not just in the Kuiper Belt , but in what you call the Oort Cloud ... /Kuiper Belt ? Oort Cloud ? There 's nothing but empty space there , and a few zillion comets. / Precisely . Plus some dark planets which you have n't discovered yet . Your science is not yet tracking the large-scale movements of those bodies , or their gravitational effects on each other . Nevertheless , the translator is mapping the resonant attractor patterns that emerge over time , in an effort to mark the probable locations of future events . And now it needs the specific transient identifiers to locate ? /Would you explain this in English , please ? / I 'm trying , I really am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the largest-scale meta-attractions , and then using that as a focusing device to scale down to ? /Fucking A , Charlie , if you ca n't explain it , can you just cut to the conclusion ? / p 83 I . . . yes , if you wish . The conclusion is that something 's very likely to hit the Earth , something big , and I 'm not sure yet what it is , and I need your help to find out . Bandicut remained silent and puzzled for a little while . /Oh . That 's more or less what you said in the first place , is n't it ? But listen , then . . . why insist upon secrecy ? / There was a sigh , before the quarx answered . That 's another part of the chaos analysis : the sociopolitical attractors . The translator says that time is too short , and if we go public , we 'll set up turbulences that may delay our acting until it 's too late . Bandicut frowned . Before he could think of a reply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting a pretty heavy burden on you , I know . But there 's one more thing here that you ought to know , too . /Which is ? ? / Uh  --  well , you see ... there 's a good possibility that I might not live long enough to see this to its proper  --  oh , hell 's bells ! NOW what 's happening ? ? He was interrupted by a hash of static .  | /WHAT ? CHARLIE ! / ? <mode-shift> ? ? **16;100;loss ? He could n't hear the quarx over the static . There was some sort of jostling going on , but he could n't tell if it was within the data-connection , or on the outside . The static faded , but there was still some sort of scratchy interference , like a malfunctioning neurolink junction , or an audio speaker distorting a human voice . For a moment , he felt a rush of panic . Was this going to be another devastating breakdown , only without the neuro ? It had seemed safe enough . . . but now the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ images had turned to snow . The interference persisted a moment longer , before ? ? ? <alpha-disconnect> ? ? ? p 85 was followed by a stunning silence . The silence was broken only by the jangling of his nerves and the slow return of his external senses . /Charlie ? Are you still there ? / The quarx stirred . /// I 'm here , but so is someone else ! Open your eyes , John ! Open your eyes ! /// What the hell was Charlie talking about ? Was someone else trying to get access to his thoughts ? Suddenly he realized that the quarx was speaking literally . His eyelids flicked open , and in the gloom of his bunk , he saw the privacycurtain dimpling inward with rhythmic beats . Someone was whacking on it from the outside . He heard a muffled voice . " Bandie ! You in there ? Hey , Bandie ! " /// Who is it ? /// Bandicut groaned . /I think I know . I 'd better answer. / /// Do n't tell them about me ! /// @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the curtain a few inches and peered out into the glare of the room light . " What d' ya want , Krackey ? " he grunted . His roommate , Gordon Kracking , was pacing back and forth in front of their stacked bunks , waving his arms in obvious distress . Bandicut sighed . Krackey was arguably one of the brightest individuals in the entire Triton opera-tion  --  and also one of the most ungainly , with angular bones and an owlish haircut ; and whenever he was really worked up about something , all of that mental power somehow transformed him into a sight that reminded Bandicut of a crippled duck trying to fly . /// Who is this ? /// t he quarx asked .  | /My friend , / Bandicut sighed . /Do n't mind him , he 's a bit of a goak. / /// Goak ? ? /// " Bandie ! " Kracking cried . " I knew you were in there ! " " Yeah , Krackey , you got me on that one . Now make a little room , will you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet out over the edge of the bunk . At the same time , he sat up , banging his head on the bunk above him . " Ow ! " He cursed quietly . Three months in this place and he was still banging his goddamn head on that goddamn bunk . Krackey greeted him like a long-lost brother . " Bandie ! What happened out there , man ? We were afraid you were a goner ! " Bandicut squinted back at him from the bunk . His head was still foggy with the things Charlie had been saying , and he was trying to remember what it was they had been talking about at the very end , before the interruption . He felt as if he had awakened from a dream , and the threads of it were slipping away , even as he tried to fix them in his memory . But it was too late ; they were gone . " What are you talking about ? " he rasped finally . Krackey cocked his head , eyes blazing . He had one blue and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , everyone knows about it  --  how you fried your buggy and would be frozen stiff out there if Genghis had n't come along and gotten you running again . What were you doing in the laser area anyway ? " Bandicut let out an annoyed breath . " Who said I was in the laser area ? " " That 's what I heard , " said Krackey . " I do n't know who said it first . " " What else did they say  --  that I went into orbit ? Look , I did n't fry anything  --  and it was n't Genghis , it was Napoleon . And he did n't fix it , he just hopped a ride back to save his lazy , robot ass the walk home . " p 87 Krackey was shaking his head . " Sandie , that 's not the way people are saying it . Look , man  --  I trust you , you know that . If you want me to set the record straight for you ? " Bandicut sighed as he slid down from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess I can tell you . What really happened is that I met an alien out there , and was lucky to get back without being dissected alive . " /// What are you doing/II/// Krackey looked hurt as Bandicut walked past him . " Come on , John  --  I 'll keep it quiet if you want me to . But what really happened ? I heard Jackson was fit to be tied . " " I just told you . " ///John , you PROMISED ! /// He ignored the quarx . " Look , Jackson should be put out of his misery , for all of our sakes . I did n't do anything that ? " He sighed . " Ah , never mind . You would n't believe me anyway . No one else does . " He traipsed into the lay , with Krackey following . /Do n't worry , Charlie . You do n't think he 'd actually believe me , do you ? / " Come on , Bandie ! " Krackey wailed . /// Will he ? /// /Not a chance. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unshaven face and his copper-green eyes , he thought , Do I look possessed ? Are you in there , Charlie , in those eyes ? Sighing , he shook his head and glanced back at his friend . " Krack , if you do n't want to believe me , you can read all about it on the board newsies . They wo n't have it right , either  --  but at least it 'll be official . " " Bandicoot , give me a break ! Why 'd they demote you to mining ops ? Something must have happened ! " Krackey could n't bear mysteries like this , and he was staring at Bandicut imploringly . Suddenly his eyes widened and understanding seemed to dawn . " Sandie ! " He lowered his voice . " You did n't have one of those damn fugues , did you ? " Bandicut nearly froze , but forced himself to bend to wash his hands and face . He dried himself and said in a low  | voice , through the towel , " Now , Krackey  --  if that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the funny room already , would n't they ? " He peered up at his friend and was greeted with a sober gaze . He had had a fugue , Krackey was realizing . " Look , " Bandicut said quietly , " I 'd appreciate it if we could drop the subject for a while . You can just tell people that it was all blown out of proportion . Really  --  I had a malfie , but I fixed it , and nothing happened . Okay ? " Krackey nodded slowly . " Okay , Bandie . " He hesitated , scratching the back of his neck . " But listen  --  let me know if it happens again , will you ? You ca n't let this keep happening . If it does , like it or not , you 're going to have to see the docs . " Bandicut snorted . " I mean it , Bandie . " " Yeah , " Bandicut sighed . " I will . Okay ? " He waited until Krackey nodded , then he returned to zip up his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word . He was n't going to be able to just waltz around the base pretending nothing had happened , he soon realized . He went to the cafeteria for an early supper , and by the time he 'd finished eating , three different people had stopped to ask him what had happened out on the plain  --  the unspoken gist being , are you still employed here , and are you planning to do anything else that will screw up the works for the rest of us ? He answered the questions casually but tersely , and by the third time , he was starting to feel pretty peeved . /// You are n't going to tell anyone else that you met an alien , are you ? /// Charlie asked worriedly . " You have n't heard me tell anyone , have you ? " he snapped . Realizing that he had just spoken aloud , he glanced around self-consciously , grateful that the room was p 89 mostly empty . Careful ! he thought . It was easy enough to direct his thoughts inward , while maintaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terms of neuro-connect . The trouble was that that state of mind tended to leave him with a blank and rather stupid expression on his face , and that did n't seem like a very helpful camouflage . The quarx persisted . /// When you told Krackey before ... about me . Was that a joke ? /// He shrugged . /Ha ha. / /// I 'm serious ! /// /Yeah , okay . Yes , it was a joke. / He finished his tempeh-and-tomato sandwich and began picking at the custard dessert . /// Well . . . was it a joke on me , or on Krackey ? /// Bandicut stared at the wall , knowing he had a dumb expression on his face , but unable to help it . /I 'll leave that for you to figure out , / he said . /Jeez , Charlie , I thought you said you 'd learned all about us by watching TV . You sound like a raw recruit ! What kind of an invader are you ? / /// I 'm not any kind of an invader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was another joke .

He almost choked on his custard . /What was that for ? / he grunted in bewilderment . /// Laughtrack . Is n't that how jokes are answered , on TV ? /// Bandicut shook his head in bewilderment . /What are you talking about ? I 've never even heard of such a thing. /  | /// No ? Really ? /// /I think you 're operating with some rather quaint and outmoded ideas , Charlie . Maybe we should sit and watch the holo for a few days , and just let you catch up. / Bandicut rose from the table and hooked a thumb at the busrobot , pointing to his dirty dishes on the table . The robot twitched slightly ; he could have sworn that it shrugged and looked away from him . Shaking his head , he loped out of the cafeteria , moving along an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV ? I do n't think we can afford the time ? /// /I was most certainly not serious . Look , Charlie  --  if you do n't mind , I 'd like to cut the crap here and start understanding what 's happening to my life. / /// I think that 's wise . /// Bandicut nodded and stopped to peer out one of the corridor windows , with a view toward the main surface mining area . A cloud of vapor was rising from beyond the intervening building structures ; the lasers were back in operation , burning away ices and rock in search of embedded metals . The metals of a civilization from another star system , another eon . . . a civilization destroyed by war . The images that the quarx had shared with him rose again in his mind . It occurred to him that he was the only human being alive who knew the actual source and history of those metals . He felt a sudden , deep sadness in his heart , and realized that Charlie was also seeing those images again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Charlie. / The quarx stirred uneasily , and changed the subject . /// I guess I still have some things to explain to you . /// /I have n't forgotten . But your " mission " is n't the only thing I have to think about . I need to go check the system boards and see what sort of reassignment they 've given me . Just because I 've been given a mission to save the Earth p 91 does n't mean I do n't still have a job to do here . Unless you decide our mission is urgent enough to let me talk ... / The quarx spoke up hastily . /// No . We can always go public , if the situation warrants . But we ca n't then go unpublic , if you follow . /// /Yes , well ... / Bandicut turned to continue down the corridor . " John ! " he heard , from behind him . It was a woman 's voice . He turned and saw Georgia Patwell from ops coming his is way with a relaxed , loping , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gravity . She was accompanied by another woman , about six inches shorter , who was moving with a more energetic gait . Bandicut recognized the other woman from the exoarchaeology group down in the basement . " Hi , " he said , hoping he would n't be asked one more time what he 'd done wrong . " Bandie , I thought you were going to give Stelnik hives today , when you dropped out of contact , " Georgia said , gliding to a stop with a grin . " I know I should n't , but I have to give you credit . That was great . " " Uh  --  thanks . " " You 're all right , though , are n't you ? " She suddenly looked concerned . " I read your report . I do n't know where everyone else is getting their ideas , but it sounds as if they 're trying to elect you sacrificial lamb of the week . " " I , uh ? " " You know my friend , do n't you ? " Georgia turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Julie Stone , from exoarch ? John Bandicut , survey ops ? " Bandicut gulped and nodded , trying to smile . " I , uhyes , I think we 've met ? " Julie offered a hand to shake . " In the rec area . I 've seen you playing Einey Steiney , but I do n't think we 've been in-  | troduced . " Her face flashed with a quick smile , then became inscrutable . She was pretty , Bandicut thought , with short brown hair and blue eyes ; and she was probably thinking to herself , so this is the goak who fried his neuros , and then fried a rover for good measure and held up half the station 's operations for a couple of hours . Good one to stay away from , she was probably thinking . He felt a sudden temptation to introduce Charlie to the two women , then felt his face flush as he realized he was still shaking her hand . " Nice to meet you , " he croaked , letting go . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Julie offered . " Georgia was just telling me about it . " Great , Bandicut groaned inwardly . He took a breath and nodded . " It was n't one of my better days . I was just on my way to . . . see where I 've been reassigned . " " Well , good luck , " said Julie . " Hang in there , Bandie , " Georgia said , patting him on the arm as she continued on her way with Julie . Thanks , Bandicut whispered silently . He sighed and followed the women , but slowly , allowing them to disappear through the bulkhead doors ahead of him . /// You seemed rather ill at ease with those women , /// the quarx noted . Bandicut shrugged . /Not with Georgia . She 's easy to be friends with . She 's married , of course , which is probably why . No threat , you know . But the other one ? / He hesitated . ///Julie ? Did n't she fit your idea of . . friendliness ? /// /Uh-huh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect the worst , somehow , when I meet a woman I like . I always figure something will go wrong , that they 'll wind up . . . not ... I do n't know why. / p 93 /// Hm. /// /What do you mean , " Hm " ? You are n't going to start psychoanalyzing me , are you ? / /// Well , no , but . . . I just wondered .. . is this the way you always relate to women ? /// Bandicut stopped at another window and pressed his fingers to the supertherm glass . Just on the other side of that pane was a rarefied atmosphere at a temperature much closer to absolute zero than to the temperature inside which was keeping him alive . Sometimes it was a distraction to think about things like that , but right now he found that it focused his thoughts remarkably . /I do n't really have many relationships with women , Charlie , except for a few ... friends . . . like Georgia. / The quarx was silent for a moment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? /// /Dakota ? Well , yes  --  she was orphaned when the rest of my family was killed in the Chunnel . But Charlie , she 's just a girl , plus she 's related . That 's hardly the same thing. / /// But you 're sending her some of your earnings ? /// Bandicut shrugged . /Big deal . I could n't let her depend on my sister-in-law 's family , could I ? / ///Um ... /// /She 's a nice kid , Dakota . I want her to have a chance when she gets older. / Bandicut turned away from the window with a sigh . /I got ta go see where I 'm posted for work tomorrow . Want to come ? / He started back down the corridor , passing several people and not meeting their eyes . /// Ho ho . John , I have an idea . Is there anything you have to be doing right now ? ///  | /Besides checking the postings ? I guess not. / He thought of the sleep he was going to need if he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can sleep later . I think you 'll like this idea . /// /I 'm listening. / /// Good . Is there someplace we can go , where if you still had your neuro , you 'd be able to connect to the datanet ? /// Bandicut walked a little more briskly . /I guess so . Why ? / /// There 's something I 'd like to try . I might be able to improve on what we did a while ago . /// /You 're going to try to plug me in ? / Bandicut felt his pulse rate increase . /Well  --  there are the operations centers , but we could n't just walk in and use them . Anyway , I ca n't just plug in  --  or even pretend to  --  without people noticing . Charlie , everyone knows I lost my neuro ! / /// Is n't there someplace private ? /// /I suppose we could use the rec center . That would n't give us full datanet access , but we could reach some of the public info services . We could use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connecting direct , or by screen. / /// Sounds perfect . Let 's go . /// From the smell of the rec center , someone had thrown a party here recently , with liberal amounts of locally fermented , hydroponic-grain beverages . By now , the depheads had probably plastered the system board with notices warning against any future such occurrences . Bandicut wrinkled his nose against the stale beer smell and found an empty booth . He did n't give a damn what manage- p 95 ment thought , as long as they did n't try to associate him with it . /Here we go , / he said , locking the booth door and sliding into the console seat . /This is where people come when they want to send or receive messages from in-system . They expect people to be looking for privacy here . But we are n't going to get the higher functions. / /// We 'll see . /// He raised his eyebrows , but did n't ask what the quarx meant . /How do you want to do this ? First I need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ / He poked at the screen controls and brought up the newest notices and job listings . He noted that a brief summary of his mishap was posted , with a warning that until an investigation was completed , all rover electrical systems should be regarded as susceptible to possible cryo-failure. /They bought it , / he muttered in disbelief . He checked the job postings and cursed . He was to report to mining ops for the early shift the next day . /They did n't buy it that much. / With a sigh , he flicked off the screen . He did n't even want to read the newsies of his accident , knowing how much the local amateur newsie reporters took from the rumor mills . /What do you want me to do ? / he asked the quarx. /// Put the ' trodes on your head . /// /Charlie , they took my implants out . There 's nothing for the ' trodes to connect to. / /// Leave that to me. /// He reached for the headset and hesitated , hands holding the set in midair. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If this goes wrong ... / /// It might not work . But I do n't think there 's any danger . /// Though he found this less than wholly reassuring , Bandicut positioned the neural set over his temples . The inductance electrodes pressed firmly against the spots on either  | side where he had once had receptor plates implanted under his skin . The contact made him acutely aware of the emptiness , the lack of what had once felt as important to him as his eyes , or his hands . /// Okay , I need to make some adjustments . Try to keep your thoughts still . /// He tried . He pushed away a fleeting rush of excitement at the thought that the quarx might actually be able to work a miracle here . He thought of the medical labs ; he thought of the wrecked buggy ; he thought of sleep ; he thought of a pink elephant . He thought of how miserable he was going to feel if he got his hopes up for this and then nothing happened . /// Hush , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He felt something like a warm , soft rain in his mind and felt the thoughts melt away , leaving him relaxed and expectant . The quarx must have done something to give him soothing alpha-wave relaxation . It was blissful . There was a brief rush of static , and then he fell off the edge of a cliff into a deep , long , weightless fall .. . ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? <alpha-connect> ? ? ? ? **18;118;full-neural ? ? **12;138;mode Lights sparkled around him , like a fishing net encrusted with diamonds , flung against a night sky .

The linkup was a little rough , but . . . this was precisely what he had been hoping for . . . if it was real . Charlie cut in. /// It is real . Is this the datanet we should be looking for ? /// /Charlie  --  this should n't be possible ! Not without the neuros ! How did you do it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making certain cross-connections in the neuronal structure ? /// /You mean , altering my brain ? / /// Well , no . I mean , not  --  well , no .

Something to do with astronomical data .. . ///Ah , here we are//// Pages of letters and numbers began swarming past at a dizzying rate . Bandicut blinked , trying to follow . It looked familiar . It was familiar ; it was a table of data on the positions and movements of astronomical bodies . /Is that an ephemeris ? / he protested . /Charlie , you could have gotten that stuff from the station library ! It would n't have cost a cent ! / For a few moments there was no answer , as the data spun past at a rate too fast to follow . Then the quarx answered softly , /// Library ?

Though he could n't quite follow what was happening , he had an uncomfortable suspicion that Charlie was somehow altering some of the fixed parameters of the datanet connection . He thought he heard an alarm sounding somewhere just at the edge of the system , but it fell silent so quickly that he was n't actually sure he had heard it . /// I hope no one else heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ / ///Hold on I 've just about got the uplink to the orbital station . . . /// /WHAT ? / /// Now , if I can just defocus their downlink beam by a hair . . . /// Suddenly , without actually seeing the quarx 's actions , he had a shockingly clear view of its results .

A beam that at this moment was no doubt being monitored by an alien machine in a subterranean cavern . /CHARLIE ! / ///Almost done . A few more seconds .. . there . Off .

He just had no idea what to think , or say . /// We can leave now , if you want , /// said the quarx softly . /// I believe you wanted to get some sleep ? ///  | HE SLEPT THE sleep of the dead , emotionally and physically exhausted . When he 'd first gotten back to his bunk , he 'd been a nervous wreck , totally unable to sleep ; but the quarx had touched something here in his mind , and there , and he had miraculously dropped off in a matter of minutes . At some point during the night , he became aware of dreaming . He did not wake , but felt a profound inner certainty that came to life even in the depths of sleep . The dream was alien and at times alarming : images of ghostly lights drifting in darkness , and rushing toward him at great speed before expanding and turning inside out , with a bewildering series of flashes , and an abrupt twisting of the darkness . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights  --  that it was space-time itself twisting and devouring its own tail , that it was some quarxly transformation or journey , and he found himself unaccountably frightened and lonely .. . And as that dream image flickered away , he glimpsed a creature like a slender tree trunk swaying in the wind , and he recognized it as one of the Fffff tink . He knew that his quarx , or at least a quarx very like the quarx he knew , had  | lived in its mind for a very long time , during which the Fffff'tink endured solar flares , earthquakes , and opposition from its own fellows as it struggled to help move a remnant of its people into space , to escape a dying world . And during that time , the quarx died several times ; and in the end , when the Fffff'tink died , releasing it , the quarx never learned for certain whether the Ffffftink civilization had survived or not .. . Base-morning came all too soon . Bandicut awoke to a chirruping alarm-clock sound and rolled over , remembering with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quarx in his mind ; and for a moment , he wanted to ask , do all of your hosts die in terrible catastrophes , but before he could form the words , he fell asleep again . The next time he awoke , it was to a brash bugle call in his head , blatting a musical reveille. /// GOOD MAWWWNIN , TRITONNNN ! /// He groaned , pushing himself up on one elbow . " What the kr'deekin ' hell ? ? " And then he realized the source , and his vision turned red , even in the darkness of the bunk . /Charlie , what are you ? / /// It 's from an old movie ! Just trying to help you start the day right ! /// /Well , DO N'T ! / He practically screamed the words out loud . /// Sorry . . . I guess I did n't ? /// /No , you did n't . I do not like to be awakened that way . Ever . I do not have a sense of humor in the morning. / Bandicut sank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an effort to come fully awake . ///I really did n't mean to ? /// /Never mind . Just let me wake up , okay ? God , were those your memories I was dreaming ? / The dream images clung to him like cobwebs , vague but troubling . p 113 /// Probably . I was . . . dreaming ... myself Was it ... the Fffff'tink ? /// The quarx 's voice was muted , and seemed sad . He sighed , nodding , and rolled back up on one elbow . /Hell of an autobiography you could write , man. / He was answered by silence , which was perhaps just as well . For a little while , he thought , he would like to hear just one voice in his head . He yanked his privacy-curtain aside and slid down from his bunk . He made no effort to greet the others who were emerging from their cubbies , but went straight into the shower with his wash kit . By the time he came out , somewhat more awake , he saw that Krackey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mining ops today ? " Krackey murmured sympatheti-cally . He nodded and shrugged on his jumpsuit . Krackey seemed to recognize his need for quiet this morning , for which he was grateful . Not everyone else was so respectful . " Bandicoot ! " called Mick Eddison , a tall , whiplike , moodily dispositioned man who worked in the deep mines . " I hear you 're coming down to join us in some real hands-on work today . You going to be one of the guys for a change ? " Bandicut sighed , realizing that there was no hope of avoiding this sort of needling . " Well , Eddie  --  since you asked  --  I heard you guys were n't doing too well down there . Not enough brains , is the way Cole Jackson put it to me . So I offered to come help you out . " Eddison glared at him , but several of the others guffawed at Eddison 's expense and snapped their towels at him until he shouted , " Keep that up , and I 'm gon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " That brought some thumping from the opposite side of the wall . Bandicut left to go to breakfast , shaking his head in amused ex-asperation.  | ///Are they always so ... crude ? /// Charlie wondered on the way to the cafeteria . /Hah ! Charlie , my friend , this is the working man 's world , / Bandicut answered . /We do n't exactly run what you would call a highbrow operation here. / ///Apparently not . May I ask : why do they call you Bandicoot ? /// Bandicut took his place in the food service line . /It 's just a dumb nickname they gave me . It 's an animal  --  either a rat or a marsupial , depending on whether you 're talking India or Australia . I looked it up . They 're both pretty ugly critters. / /// Oh . I think I see . Would you like me to call you Bandicoot also ? /// /Try it and you 'll be one dead mokin ' goak , / Bandicut threatened cheerfully . Bad enough I have to put up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ / Charlie hesitated . /// Oh . Now I think I see . /// Bandicut slid a plate of cultured eggs onto his tray , along with some toast and a cup of roastamoke , and looked for a quiet place to sit . He knew he would n't get through breakfast without more ribbing from his coworkers , but most of it turned out to be good-natured . He was finally starting to feel almost good  --  except for a busrobot that was chittering annoyingly at him as he dumped his own breakfast tray ? when Eddison walked in and asked loudly , " So whose team are they putting you on , Bandicoot ? Whose equipment gets fried today ? " Bandicut handed his empty tray to the robot to shut it up . " Well , now I guess that 's up to Herb , is n't it ? " he said mildly . " If we 're both lucky , it wo n't be yours . " /// Who 's Herb ? /// Charlie asked , preventing him from hearing Eddison 's reply over the muttering of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 115 /Herb Massengale . The mining supervisor. / /// You do n't sound happy . /// Bandicut followed the general movement of workers down the corridor . /I think , if I had a choice , I 'd rather work with Lonnie Stelnik , / he said . ///My . Are all of your supervisors so unpleasant ? /// Bandicut chuckled . /Well , now , have n't you just put your finger on it . Lemme put it this way . Lonnie Stelnik 's self-centered and ambitious , but at least he 's no dummy . c ; ole Jackson 's different  --  he 's a cowardly rule-worshiper -- but give him his due , he 's not dumb , either . But Herb Massengale ? Well , you 'll see. / Charlie seemed thoughtful . /Why so quiet , suddenly ? Are you wondering why you aliens ever bothered listing humanity on the roll call of sentient species ? / he asked . When there was no answer , he added , /We are on the rolls , are n't we ? Of sentient species ? / ///Mmm. /// /What the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  that was a joke , right ? / Charlie seemed to clear his quarxian throat . /// Sort of But the truth is , I 'm wondering about the people in authority here . Their character ... well , we must take it into account , when we make our plans . /// /Ah. / Bandicut grunted . /I wish I could offer you more encouragement on that score. / He followed a group of men toward the ready room , but paused when he heard Gordon Kricking 's voice behind him in the corridor . " Sandie  --  did n't you look at the postings this morning ? " He turned around . " No , I looked last night . Why ? " Krackey caught up with him . " You 're not supposed to  | 16 be here . You 're supposed to be upstairs for a hearing on your accident . " " You 're sure ? " " Sure I 'm sure . I work on the system board , do n't I ? " Bandicut grinned . " Reprieve ! Thanks , Krackey . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heading for the pole up . He ascended the pole with a few easy arm-over-arm pulls and stepped off on the third and top floor of the station . The briefing room was just past Cole Jackson 's office , near the station commander 's . He could hear Jackson 's voice , and Lonnie Stelnik 's . What fun , he thought . /Charlie , if they start grilling me , be ready with some good answers , all right ? / /// I 'll do my best . /// " There he is ! " said Stelnik , as Bandicut walked into the cramped conference room . The station commander 's administrative assistant , a thin Chinese woman named Li Chang , was there also . " You might have let a guy know , " Bandicut said , taking a seat . " As of last night , you had me slated for the mines this morning . " Cole Jackson pushed up his eyeglasses and smiled . " Do n't worry , John . We 'll get you right back down there . But first we 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if there 's anything you 'd like to add or change . " He pushed his glasses up his nose again and handed Bandicut a hard copy of his report . Bandicut glanced at the paper . " Has Pacho found the problem yet ? " Stelnik snorted . Jackson answered , " Mr. Rawlins has not yet determined the cause of the malfunction , no . In fact , he admits to being rather puzzled . " Jackson glanced at Stelnik as though expecting a vulgar characterization . When none was forthcoming , he continued , " Therefore , John , it 's espe-  | dally important that you search your memory for anything that could illuminate the cause of the incident . We 're holding up the survey for the time being , but we ca n't do that forever . " Bandicut nodded , and frowned down at his report . /For a pack of lies , it looks pretty reasonable , / he muttered to the quarx . He swallowed , trying to maintain a normal expression . " No , I wish I could help you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . /Give or take an alien or two ' /// Only one . /// " Take your time , John . This is important . " " Well , yes , but ? " " Let me emphasize , " Jackson said , with a sideways glance at Chang , who would be reporting to the station commander . " We have certain quotas to fulfill ? " " You ca n't put quotas on finding alien metal deposits , " Bandicut pointed out . " Perhaps not . But we have quotas on volume and tonnage to be processed , and it is very important that we meet those quotas , " Jackson said , somewhat more sternly than was necessary . " This is not a game ! We are here at enormous expense to the MINEXFO consortium , and there are important products to be developed from our findings . It is crucial that we demonstrate progress . There are consortium shareholders to satisfy , and potential competitors who might want to replace us here . I just want to make sure you understand that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bandicut said testily . " I 'm ready to go hack out as soon as you fix my rover . " Jackson sat back , pressing his hands together in front of his face . After studying Bandicut for a moment , he nodded , with another glance at Chang , who had not said a word and looked as though she did not intend to . " Very well . But we can not do so until we are certain we have established safe working conditions . " He cleared his throat noisily . " Well , t hen , if we might go through this report , we will try to clar-  | ify any points of confusion . Lonnie , would you like to take it from that angle ? " Stelnik 's eyes glinted as he sat forward and said , " Indeed . John , tell me  --  with reference to your report of lost communications and navigation  --  what was your first indication of trouble yesterday ? " Bandicut took a breath . /What did you tell that robot ? / he whispered silently . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . /// He caught himself in the act of nodding to the quarx , and let the movement continue as a nod to Stelnik . " Well , Lonnie  --  I was just out of visual range of marker Wendy when I saw a fluctuation in the nay . I suspected a voltage spike . But the comm dropped out before I could call in ... " If his listeners were forming opinions , he could not discern it on their faces as he continued spinning his tale . " Thank you , John . We 'll be in touch as the investigation proceeds , and we 'll call you back if we have further questions . You can report to mining ops now . " " Right . See you around , Cole . Lonnie . " The quarx spoke softly as he slid back down the pole to the first level . /// What was the purpose of that meeting , John ? /// Bandicut stepped off and walked toward the ready room for the second time that morning . /Charlie , you 've just witnessed modern management at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Jackson to make sure that he and the company are covered , if any questions arise  --  either about safety or productivity. / /// Uh-huh . /// /Plus , Lonnie was probably hoping to catch me in a lie , because that would prove how sharp he is. / The quarx did n't sound happy . p 119 /// Uh-huh . Anything else ? /// He reached the ready room . /Plus , let 's give them credit . I suppose they really were trying to figure out what the hell happened. / He let out a long breath . /And I have to say , my quarxian friend , that the hypocrisy of all this has not escaped me . I do not feel too wonderful about having , yet again , lied through my teeth. / Charlie was silent a moment , but Bandicut could feel the mental tension building . When Charlie answered , it was in a very soft voice in the center of his consciousness . /// I do understand , John Bandicut . I share your ethical misgivings . /// /You do ? / @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well .. . that meeting did not give me reason to feel that we would dare entrust our secret to those individuals . /// Bandicut nodded , his vision clouding as he realized what the quarx was saying . They were not going to be sharing their secret with anyone , anytime soon . But neither could he muster any good reason to disagree . " BANDICUT ! Get the hell over here ! " Herbert Massengale was standing in the doorway to his office , clipboard in hand . As Bandicut approached , Massengale glared at him . " I just got the bad news , Bandicut . You 're on my team . " " So I 'm told . " " Now , what the fokin ' moke am I supposed to do with a nine-pin-head goak who do n't even got his pins anymore ? " Massengale rapped his knuckles on the clipboard in disgust . /// What 's he talking about ? What 's a nine-pin-head goak ? /// /It 's an , er , " affectionate " nickname for neurojackers. / ///Affectionate ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't neurolink himself , and he hates the guts of anyone who does. / /// That does n't seem reasonable . ///  | /What 's reasonable got to do with it ? / " What are you grinnin ' about ? " Massengale growled . " You look like you 're plugged into a mokin ' computer right now . Are you gon na go zombie on me before you even start ? " Bandicut felt his face redden . He was going to have to learn to talk to Charlie without looking like an idiot . " Herb , if there 's something you have for me to do , maybe we could just get on with it , " he said , straining for politeness . Massengale stared at him as if Bandicut had just done something to his nice clean windshield . " Yeahhhhh . We 're shorthanded on the crawlers . Report to Bronson on number three . " Without waiting for an answer , Massengale strolled away . Bandicut curled his lip downward . It was more or less what he had expected . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he would merely get in the way , instead of becoming an active hazard to the operation . Shaking his head , he reported to the equipment window and signed out an outdoor exposure suit . When he had finished gearing up  --  and it had been a long time since he 'd checked a suit so carefully  --  he went outside through the pressure lock , looking for Crawler Three and Bronson . He peered about the vast unroofed crawler bay , trying to figure out where he was supposed to be . Two of the huge mining machines had already pulled out of their docking bays and were lumbering off toward the work fields , amber beacons rotating in the perpetual night of the Triton sky . About a hundred meters down the docking bay , he spotted a faded , dusty numeral 3 on another crawler . As he set off toward it with a loping stride , its beacons flicked on , glaring in his face . He hurried , calling out on the comm . " Bronson ! " The crawler chief was halfway up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hand raised to wave the driver on . He turned his helmeted head and lowered his hand . Bandicut could just make out a frown through the p 121 faceplate . Bronson 's voice moaned with an exaggerated , aggrieved tone through the background chatter on the comm . " What the  --  Bandicut ! Now do n't tell me that asshole Herb sent you out to work with me ! " Bandicut halted at the base of the crawler and looked up with a grin . " Can I quote you to the boss on that ? Especially the asshole part ? " Bronson snorted , white eyes gleaming through the visor from an almost invisible black-skinned face . " Lissen  --  I 'm the mokin ' boss out here , and unless you wan na try mindmeldin ' with some a ' that rock out there , I suggest you shut up and get your tailpipe up in that hold . So how ya ' doin ' , anyway , Bandie ? " " Okay . What am I supposed to do here ? " " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Now , get your tail up there . We 're late already . " Bandicut gave Bronson a jaunty salute and grabbed a ladder up to the work cabin . As he climbed , he saw Bronson mounting the ladder to the roof of the crawler and heard him drawl : " Get ' er movin ' , Fitznell . " The massive machine rumbled for an instant , then lurched forward , just as Bandicut was ducking through the cabin threshold . He lost his balance momentarily , slamming his left shoulder into the bulkhead . Grabbing the handrail with a curse , he heaved himself the rest of the way in and pulled the door closed behind him . The inside of the crawler looked more like a small , ma-chine-filled factory than a vehicle  --  except that it was in jerky motion . He was on a narrow platform that connected to a series of catwalks spanning the interior . A suited man was standing at a forward control panel . He turned , saw Bandicut , and waved him over . Bandicut threaded his way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him on his left , two mining drones hung in their cradles like enormous crabs waiting to go scuttling over the mine bed . Far-  | ther to the left , he vaguely recognized the shadowy bulk of the power reactor and ore processor . /// I gather you 're not too familiar with this equipment . /// /Nah , I was shown around one of these things when I first arrived on Triton , but I have n't had any reason to be inside one since. / He finally reached the man at the control panel . It was Jake Looks-Over , a part Amerind whom he knew from games of EineySteiney in the rec lounge . " Hi , Jake . What can I do here ? " Jake grinned behind his faceplate , eyes bright against a burnished face . " Hey , Bandie ! That depends , I guess . You just along for the ride , or did they send you in from the frontier to find out what real work is like ? " Bandicut grabbed another handhold . " I was hoping I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hear , you guys need more brains than brawn out here . " Jake raised one eyebrow toward a monitor on the control board , where a woman 's helmeted face was visible . " You hear that , Amy ? John Bandicut 's here to give us the benefit of his brains . Someone must 've squealed on us . " The woman 's face jounced with the vibration . Bandicut realized that she was driving the crawler . " Have n't I been threatening all along to squeal on you guys ? " she said . Bandicut could just see the landscape moving outside the cockpit , past her head . " Fitznell , whose side are you on , anyway ? " Jake pro-tested . " You guys must be hard up if you want me out here helping you , " Bandicut said . " But that 's what they tell me to do , so I do it . " Jake nodded . " Well , we can put you to work driving a miner . An ace pilot like you ought to be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depends . How hard is it ? " Jake grinned without answering .  | Bandicut peered at the external monitors . The crawler was rumbling down a long access road out of the main camp . Soon it would begin descending into a vast depression a kilometer or so to the west . The mining area was ringed with lights that glared and shifted surreally in the monitors . " We 'll be there in five minutes , " Jake said . " You can stash your lunch in that locker . " " Lunch ? " Bandicut croaked . " No one told you to bring a lunch ? Hoo boy , you 're going to be one hungry customer by the time we 're done here . " Jake shook his head . " Well , never mind . You want to go up and have a look from the cab before we strap you in ? That okay , Amy ? " " Sure , " said the driver . Jake hooked a thumb toward a ladder on his left . Banclicut mounted the ladder , glancing nervously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sight of the vibrating machinery caused him to tighten his grip on the handholds . He caught a handle at the top , a hatch slid open , and he climbed up into the back of the cab . Amy Fitznell 's helmeted head bobbed as she drove . She glanced up into the overhead mirror , her visor shifting in the polished glass . " Hi , Bandie . Have a seat and take a look around . " Bandicut slid into the right-hand seat and peered out the forward window . In the perpetual Triton gloom , the crawler and roadway lights combined to make an eerie highway landscape . Two crawlers ahead were turning off into various sectors . " Which one we going to ? " he asked . " Northwest sector . " Fitznell , scanning the instruments and monitors , looked every bit as busy as a pilot . Bandicut felt a little envious ; he wondered what it felt like to drive one of these monsters . " Eat your heart out , " she murmured , as though reading his mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed . /// What 's that mean ? /// /Never mind . Too hard to explain. / " Better go back and let Jake get you squared away , " Fitznell said . " Okay , thanks for the look . " Bandicut exited the way he had come . As he stepped off the ladder onto the work platform , Jake pointed to one of the mining drones hanging in the cradles . " Bandie , I 'm putting you on drones three and four there . Think you can handle ' em ? " Bandicut grimaced . " You sure you want me to run those things ? I do n't know the first thing about it . " " Do n't worry , I 'll check you out . " Jake pressed several switches , then spoke again in a fast rattle . " Okay , now listen . You 're gon na be riding the drones on the inside track . It 'll be easier at the start , ' cause I 'll be tracking the outer walls on the first pass . But when we get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your step . Okay ? Go get yourself strapped into that jump seat . " Bandicut peered to his right and spotted the jump seat folded into the crawler 's outer wall . " Get going , " Jake said . " We 'll be on station in a minute . " Bandicut made his way along the catwalk , pulled the seat down , and turned to sit , facing back toward Jake . " Strap up and plug in your comm , " Jake instructed . Bandicut found the straps and , with some difficulty , got them buckled and adjusted . " When was this setup de-signed ? " he muttered . " Last century ? " " As a matter of fact . . . yes , I think so , " Jake said . " Plug in your comm . " He located the jack and did so , and Jake 's voice became slightly clearer in his ears . " See that control board on your right ? Lift it into position in front of you . " Bandicut groped and found the board hanging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He groped for the release . The board jerked up suddenly and swung into his lap . He grunted and lifted the cover . He found a display board and a worn-looking key and joy pad . " Now what do I do ? " " Click off the safety and press the ENGAGE button . " " What the hell , Jake , half these labels are worn off ! " " I know . It 's on the right . " Muttering , Bandicut found the button . The wall behind him suddenly jerked and turned , and he spun out , seat and board and all , and found himself hanging out over the right side of the lumbering crawler . The ground sped by beneath him , blurring with the shifting of the light-augment in his helmet . He swayed dizzily against his safety harness , feeling utterly naked in the seat as the crawler heaved over a large bump in the roadway . He caught the gurgling sound rising in his throat , but his hands tightened on the control board as it flexed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a cackling of merriment . " Kay , Bandie , you 're doin ' great ! " Jake called . " Do n't hang on so tight you break the thing off ! Just hook your feet in those stirrups and pretend you 're riding a horse . " Riding a horse ? Bandicut thought dimly , and shouted , " I do n't know how to ride a goddamn ? " /// Yee-hahhhh ! Grab those reins ! /// The quarx 's voice cut through the din like a cleaver. /What ? ? / /// Like this , John ! /// For an instant , his vision was overlaid with a scratchy image of two men riding horses , and whooping , and shooting handguns into the air . They were pounding along a dusty dirt road at a frightful speed . /// That 's how you ride a horse ! /// /Charlie , you idiot ! That 's goddamn Hollywood ! It 's not real ! Get it off ! / /// Sorry ... I just thought . . . ///  | The image vanished . " Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling . After a moment he added , " How you doin ' out there ? " Bandicut finally got his feet hooked into the stirrups . " How 's he doin ' ? He 's doin ' like a clink ! " chortled some-one  --  Bronson , he realized . Peering around , he spotted the boss in the observer seat way up on top of the crawler , peering down over the side . Bronson was shaking with laughter . " Hang in there , Bandicoot ! " he called . " Take a look at your board , " Jake said . " Do n't touch anything , just look for the row labeled DEPLOY , with some numbers . " Bandicut squinted , trying to read the labels against the jerky movement . " Okay , " he said finally . " Now what ? " Before Jake could answer , the crawler slowed and began a sweeping turn . Bandicut looked up and saw walls of carved ice , mottled with stone , rising alongside the roadway . Suddenly the walls opened out , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expanse of scarred land , depressed below the surrounding terrain . They had arrived on station . " Now , " Jake continued , " get ready to deploy . You 're gon na use those controls to guide the drones . Just like driving a buggy . Switch on your field monitors . " Bandicut fiddled a bit , and a display came on , giving him a split screen , both showing him the inside of the crawler . Nose cameras on the mining drones , probably . " Jake , " he muttered , " you have n't forgotten that I have no bleeking idea what I 'm doing ? " " Hey , you think any of us knew what we were doing the first time we hung our fannies out there ? " Fitznell snorted from the cab . " Do any of you know what you 're doing now ? " " If you morons would knock it off and deploy , " called Bronson . " Rog ' ? " p 127 " Deploying , " said Jake . Bandicut felt a new rumble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station swinging out with Jake on board . A few moments later he felt a lower and deeper rumble and the movement of heavy hydraulics . " Bandie , " he heard , " deploy number four first , then number three . " " Just press ? ? " " up . He felt an almost surreal sense of uninvolvement as he placed his forger on the button . Glancing up at the blue scythe of Neptune , he thought of Earth so far away he could n't even see it ; and he shook his head in sudden bewilderment . What in God 's name was he doing here ? Out across the scarred landscape , he saw two puffs of condensing vapor , barely illuminated by red laser light . Then he saw the recon robots responsible for the puffs , and he realized that they were sending probing beams into the ice and sending the telemetry to the crawler 's computer . He realized with a pang that he would feel a lot more confident if he were linked into that computer , neuron to neuron , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of joysticks . " Let 's get going , " Bronson called . " Sandie , do it , " said Jake . Bandicut pressed the button . His seat shuddered as the side of the crawler opened up and disgorged a drone , its dusty position lights glowing red , like some sort of large , demonic cockroach . The drone veered a little , then matched speeds with the mother cockroach . A green light blinked on under Bandicut 's hand . On his monitor , he saw a drone's-eye view of the ground streaming past . An amber light strobed . " It 's down ! " " Press the key marked AUTOTRACK , " Jake continued . He squinted anxiously . " What key marked AUTO-TRACK ? "  | " Top row of keys ? " " You mean where all the labels are worn off ? " " Third key from the right , " Jake said , unperturbed . Bandicut pressed the key . The amber light went green . He peered down and saw the drone moving away from the crawler , taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A thick umbilical dipped and swayed across the intervening space . It must be working right , he thought . He had n't heard anyone yell yet . " Deploy number three . " He pressed the button . A new rumbling announced the ejection of a second drone . He wasted no time in putting that one on automatic , and soon the two drones were flanking each other , with number four trailing behind and to the outside , forming a perfect half of a V with the crawler . " Are we dragging now ? " he asked . " Naw , " Jake answered . " Bronson 'll give us the word . How we doin ' , Chester ? " " Hold on to your mokin ' drawers , " Bronson drawled . " Almost there . " Bandicut glanced up and saw the boss bobbing atop the crawler , his helmet gleaming in the running lights . " Get ready to drop in about ten seconds . " Jake 's voice cut in , " Sandie , on his call , press the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , " Bronson said . Bandicut jabbed the button and waited for something to happen . He felt nothing , but in the monitors , the headon views shrank and new split-screen images appeared ; and he glimpsed mining lasers burrowing into the surface and saw confusing images of surface materials churning and being separated inside the drones . Glancing back at the actual drones , he saw light flickering beneath them ; and emerging from behind them were twin clouds of vapor and dust . " Hey Bandicoot , you 're a miner now ! " Jake called .  | He watched , nodding , as the two drones under his command churned their way through Triton 's surface like two moles burrowing for metallic remnants of an eons-old civilization .  | THE MAIN POINT of the job , it turned out , was to ride herd on the drones to keep them from blundering into each other on turns . The rest of his day alternated between stupefying tedium as he bounced in his seat watching everything track a straight line , and frantic concentration as they turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formation . The control board never seemed to work quite right , and the drones had a strong tendency to overcontrol , resulting in repeated fishtailing and skidding . The effort gave him a thumping headache , and it did n't help that his every mistake was accompanied by whoops and snorts from the top of the crawler . He half suspected Fitznell of racing around the corners to see how much he could take without demolishing the drones . And he wondered at Jake 's claim , when he asked why the computer did n't handle the turns , that the control module had failed so many times that they 'd simply given up on it and gone to manual control . By the end of the day , he was tense and exhausted  --  and ravenously hungry , even though Jake and Amy had shared their lunches with him . As they started back to base , Charlie broke a long silence to ask Bandicut if he was okay . Yes ,  | Bandicut grunted silently , making it perfectly clear that he was in no mood for conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the base , Jake and Amy congratulated him on surviving their hazing , and invited him for a beer after dinner . Bandicut squinted in thought , then shook his head with a sigh . " I just want to eat and go straight to bed . Rain check ? " " Sure , " Jake said . " Tomorrow , you 'll sail through it like the wind . " " Like the wind . Sure , " Bandicut muttered sardonically . With a wave , he jumped off the ladder from the crawler and strode off to the showers . In no time at all , his alarm was trilling in his ear . He rolled over in his bunk and groaned , realizing that it was time to start the cycle all over again . /Charlie , I hope you 're getting used to this . It looks like I 'm gon na be doing it for a while ? especially if Jackson does n't hurry up and clear me back to survey duty. / /// Well , if you can survive it , I guess I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bandicut could tell Charlie was chafing at the delay . He wanted to get back to his translator , and he could n't do that as long as Bandicut was stuck in mining ops . His coworkers took it easier on him the second day , and by evening Bandicut was ready for some diversion . After supper , he went with Jake to the rec lounge for a beer and a few games of EineySteiney pool . The game was played on a continuously curved , charcoal gray , three-dimensional holographic surface , with gravity wells for pockets and variable slopes for orbiting bank shots . The programming today had the balls labeled after the planets of the solar system . Charlie perked up after the opening shot , as they watched t he variously colored balls flash and spin away from the cen-  | ter of the table . One ball , golden Mercury , spun into the end well , while the others looped around , coasting over hills and ridges until they finally came to rest in the valleys . /// Mind if I play with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot , sighting along his cue wand . /Eh ? / Bandicut paused , eyeing a shot on mirror-surfaced Venus . /You know how to play pool ? / /// I 'm learning . /// /On my time , you want to learn ? / /// I 'm pretty good at orbital dynamics . This looks like a fairly easy set of parameters . /// /Easy , huh ? / Bandicut let his breath out , aware of Jake and several spectators waiting . /Okay , this shot 's yours. / He was half expecting the quarx to take control of his limbs . Instead he felt a gentle pressure guiding the position of his right arm as he lined up the wand with the white cue ball . He squeezed the trigger , and a laser pulse struck the cue ball , which spun up and over a rise and clicked satisfyingly into silvery Venus . Knocked out of its valley , Venus rebounded from the side rail , crested a rise , and spiraled with quickening orbits into a gravity-well pocket . " Ho , Bandie  --  you been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in salute . " Nah , just a little innate talent I been holding back till now . " Bandicut straightened up with a grin and circled the table , looking for his next shot . /Nice work there , partner. / /// Thanks . Let 's try that translucent green-and-blue ball . Is that Earth ? /// Bandicut nodded , then realized that he had done so in front of Jake and the others , as well . Everyone was watching him  --  including , he realized , that moxy-looking woman from exoarch , Julie Stone . Perhaps he had looked as though he were carefully studying the layout of the table , nodding p 133 to himself . He tried to keep his expression natural , and knew that he was probably screwing his face up more than ever . " Concentrate , " he murmured as he bent over the table . " Earth in the end well . " ///All the way down the table ? There are three ridges in between . /// /Let 's do it. / The laser flashed , and the cue ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down on the far side of the target ball , then bounced out of play and dissolved in midair with a musical chuckle . Bandicut straightened up , sighing . " Man , I wish I had some of your in-nate talent , " Jake said , laughing as he moved around the table , waiting for a new cue ball to appear . " Yeah , well , that 's the thing about talent , " Bandicut muttered , trying not to look as though he 'd noticed Julie 's presence . He inadvertently caught her eye , and a grin flashed on her face . " Sometimes raw talent is just , uh , hard to control . . . you know ? " " Yeah , I know . Oh , yeah , " Jake said , sighting his shot and zapping the Earth in a quick loop around the upper curve of the table and down into a well . It whirred resoundingly as it spiraled in . He looked up and grinned . Bandicut nodded graciously . /So , uh , how come we missed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the learning curve , okay ? Were you born knowing how to play the game ? /// /Okay , okay  --  do n't get sore. / /// I 'm not sore . But we 're going to win this game . You want to impress Julie , do n't you ? /// Bandicut flushed , and avoided looking at Julie . He turned back as Jake easily knocked Mars , Jupiter , and Saturn into wells . , We wo n't have the chance , if Jake does n't start missing some shots. /  | The cue ball danced , and Uranus , pale green with silver crescents , spun around a well and back up over a ridge to come to rest in a valley . Jake took a swig from his beer . " All yours , John . " " Do it , Bandie . " That was Amy Fitznell , who had just walked up carrying a drink that glowed neon pink under the rec lounge lights . " Make him suffer for the way he 's abused you for the last two days . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you . " Bandicut caught Julie 's eye by accident , caught a seemingly bashful smile , and grinned to himself . He sighted along the wand , measured the angles , and squeezed . The laser pulsed , the balls clicked , and not just Uranus but mirror-black Pluto spun into pockets . " Ah , too bad ! " Jake said , with an obvious mixture of glee at the premature sinking of Pluto and admiration for the physics of the shot . Bandicut shook his head ruefully . " Sorry , Amy . I tried to get him for you . " /// What happened ? /// /I lost the game . You have to sink Pluto last. / /// Oh . Sorry ! I thought it was a pretty clever shot . /// /It was a clever shot . It just cost me the game , that 's all. / " Nother game , Bandie ? " Jake asked , pressing RESET . Bandicut drew a breath . Julie was just standing there , and looked as though she might like some company . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was n't used to having company in his head when he approached women . " I du n no .

I want to say hi to Julie. / /// Well . . . yes , but . . . /// Amy took the wand with a predatory smile and ac- p 135 cepted Jake 's challenge for the next game . Bandicut moved around the table toward Julie . ///John ? /// She tipped her head at his approach , bright blue eyes flashing . " Hi , there . Nice couple of shots . How are you ? " She sipped what looked like a glass of tomato juice . " Fine . Just fine , " he murmured , trying to rid his mind of Charlie so he would n't be staring at her like a first-class idiot . " How are , uh  --  how are you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about her , not about her friend . " How 's .. . exoarch ? Anything interesting turning up ? " /// Is this how you approach women ? This seems . . . awkward . /// /Shut the hell up. / Bandicut grinned , willing Charlie to he gone . Julie 's smile dazzled him . " Oh , we 're just fine . If we fmd any aliens or alien relics , I assure you , you 'll hear about it ! " She laughed . " It 's not as if the company has us here because they expect us to fmd anything . " She shook her head and took another sip of juice . " Right  --  uh  --  sop to the environmental lobby . Is n't that what everyone says ? " Great . Now you 've insulted her . " I suppose you get tired of hearing that , " he added quickly . " Yuh . Both counts . " She shrugged . " But it 's not as if we are n't trying . We 're going over all the orbital scans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll lead us to the find . " He must have been looking at her stupidly , because she cocked her head with a quizzical expression . " I mean , if there 's all this metal residue , there must be something intact somewhere on Triton , do n't you think ? Even if it 's hundreds of meters below the surface ? " Bandicut coughed . " Yes . Yes , I suppose that 's a . . . good bet . " ///John , be careful . /// He felt his head bobbing . This was leading in a dangerous direction , and he had no idea how to back out of it .

I think I 'm just going to check the board postings and then go to bed . " Julie 's eyes flashed penetratingly . " Okay . Nice to see you , though  --  okay ?

Would you like to downlink the data at this time ? Now what the hell was that all about ? Bandicut thought .

No , I think that 's all I wanted from Planetview .

Another time , if he were less tired , he would like to peruse them further . /Okay , / he said , and touched the connection with his thought , and let the sensation of the disconnect cascade like cooling water through his brain .  | HE DREAMED VIVIDLY that night , but of his own past , not Charlie 's . He dreamed of his parents and his brother Joe , and Megan , before they were killed in the collapse of the EuroChunnel ; he dreamed of them the last time he saw them , saying good-bye in St. Louis after Joe and Megan had dropped Dakota off with Megan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grownupsonly holiday in London and Paris , while John was about to catch a flight to Bogota , Colombia , and the railgun launcher . He was bound for a tour of duty in space , and his family was bound for death . But they did n't know that then . He dreamed of Dakota at the funeral , bewildered and trembling , hugging him briefly but too shaken to say much of anything . But her eyes , those green Bandicut-child eyes , caught his just long enough to seem to make a silent plea . Begging him to take her to space . If not now , then soon . She 'd always been a space nut , always asked him about his work every chance she got . It was out of the question , of course ; at nine , she was much too young , and what would she do at L5 anyway ? Megan 's parents were Dakota 's legal guardians now , and they did n't think too highly of space work , and even if he did n't think that highly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change it . p 141 Then the dream changed , and he was floating through a wispy , star-filled nebula , speeding to catch up with someone from whom he 'd gotten separated , but he could n't quite picture who it was ... . The third day out on the crawlers was little different from the second , except that Charlie seemed troubled as they rode around and around the track , each pass carving a little deeper into the surface of the moon . It was clear that Charlie was fretting about the time that was slipping by , with no hope in sight for a return to his cavern and the translator . Bandicut , bouncing in his jump seat under the baleful eye of Neptune , was too preoccupied with his own boredom to be of much help . He liked his coworkers but loathed the repetitiveness of the job ; it was so deadening that he found it hard to muster concern for Charlie 's problem , even though it theoretically concerned him deeply : it was only the safety of the entire Earth . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and palpable . /// We might have to steal a rover to go back , /// Charlie murmured , sounding as though he were talking more to himself than to his host . /Fat chance of that , / Bandicut muttered , fishtailing the drones around a tight , inner corner . /// You 've got to help me get out there . /// /Let 's talk about it later , okay ? / The truth was , even if his heart had been in it at the moment , Bandicut could have offered only limited reassurance , since there was no way of knowing how long his superiors would take to write off the accident and send him back out on survey duty . ///Yeah ... later ... /// the quarx whispered , stirring listlessly. /Hey , you okay there ? / Bandicut asked , squinting back at the churning drones as the course straightened out . There was no answer .  | It was only as they were arriving back at base that he realized that Charlie was not just worried ; he was unwell . There were occasional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or twice he had dream-flashes of quarxian memory : flickering glimpses of alien beings , alien worlds , and feelings of grieving over some undefinable loss . " You okay there , Bandie ? " Jake asked , turning from his locker . The Amerind zipped up his casual jumpsuit . " You 're looking a little green . " Bandicut rose from the bench where he 'd been sitting and pulled on his own suit . " Yeah  --  fine , Jake . Fine . See you later , okay ? " Jake peered at him . " Okay . But you look like you should get some rest . " Bandicut nodded and waited for Jake to leave . /You okay , Charlie ? / he asked again , and this time the quarx answered , but only after he 'd started down the corridor toward the cafeteria . ///John , is there some place .. . where we can be in private , and not be interrupted ? /// He sensed a great exertion. /Well , yeah , I guess . What 's wrong ? Can I get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I may have ... miscalculated .. . please , no delay . /// /We could lock ourselves into one of the VR rooms . It 's plenty private there. / /// Yes . . . /// He walked quickly to the lounge and checked the VR occupancy board . One room was available and he ducked in , securing the door behind him . /Okay , we 're alone . What 's wrong , guy ? Are you all right ? / The quarx seemed to perk up a little in the new sur-roundings. p 143 ///I 'm ... okay for the moment , I think . What is this place ? /// /It 's a virtual reality room . I thought you watched a lot of TV . Do n't you know a VR setup when you see one ? / He opened a panel and showed Charlie where the visor , vest , gloves , and shoes were kept . /// Old TV It did n't show anything like this . You 're sure it 's private here ? /// /It 's about the most private place on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally act weird in here , because it 's all make-believe once you turn on the holos and the feedback gear . That 's the whole point. / /// Good . That 's good . Very good . /// Puzzled , Bandicut said , /So do you want me to put this stuff on , so you can see how it works ? / /// Yeah ... uh , sure . /// He began putting on the shoes and gloves , and realized that this was all wrong . The quarx had needed to talk . /Charlie , hold it  --  this VR stuff can wait . Tell me what 's wrong. / The quarx shivered . /// It 's . . . okay , John . It 's just that .. . Well , I think I 'm getting ready to die . /// Bandicut felt a sharp pain across his chest as he tensed . His hands froze , the gloves halfway on . /What ? / /// You remember , I told you . . . /// He remembered , the quarx had started to tell him once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the future . The conversation had been interrupted . But it had n't seemed very real then , anyway , or at least he had n't known Charlie so well then . /You started , but you did n't finish . What is this , Charlie ? / ///I 'm sorry , John I 'd wanted to prepare you better . ///  | But ... when ? Why ? / Somehow , he 'd known from the dreams that death came to the quarx in ways that were going to be difficult for him to comprehend . /Charlie ? / /// I 'm ... not sure when . But soon , I think . /// Bandicut swallowed , suddenly dizzy . /What do you want me to do ? What should I expect ? / He felt a strange mixture of fear and urgency and . . . something almost like relief . He was ashamed of the relief . He knew there was a lot at stake . Not just the quarx , or him . Earth , maybe . /// There 's nothing you can do about my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelings . They 're perfectly natural , I think . /// /How the hell would you know ? / Bandicut cried . /Charlie , what about . . . what about . . . everything ? Your mission ? And the translator ? / /// You 'll have to carry on . There will be . . . another . But I must brief you . You must . . . get the data to the translator . /// Bandicut swallowed . /Charlie , I do n't want you to die. / He felt a sudden surge of empathy from the quarx. /// I 'm glad , John . But look  --  we 're getting all morbid . I do n't want to get morbid . Please how about showing me something on that .. . VR thing . /// Bandicut drew a sharp breath . /Are you serious ? Now ? / /// Please .. . something peaceful . I 'd like to see Earth . Are there any Earth scenes ? /// Bandicut read the selections . /Okay , / he whispered , and p 145 made a choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentle surf filled his ears , and a brightening light overhead turned into a beaming midday sun . He was standing on a beach , looking out over an expanse of sea . After a moment , he murmured , " VR Control  --  give me late afternoon . Sun-set . " The sun faded from overhead and reappeared , enormous and crimson over the ocean . The bottom edge of the sun 's disk touched the water , flattening outward in a rippling reflection . /How 's this ? / he asked , stepping to the water 's edge . ///John , it 's ... breathtaking . /// There was a deep wistfulness in the quarx 's voice . Bandicut wondered if it were making him homesick . He felt a momentary dizziness , and suddenly felt himself hurtling headlong through space , through flickering light , tumbling and turning himself inside out . Then the feeling went away , and he was standing by the seashore again , swaying a little . He took a deep breath . Was Charlie reliving his life ? Bandicut knelt and ran his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . anything like this ? / Charlie hesitated . /// I do n't think so . No. /// Bandicut gazed up into the setting sun . /What was your world like ? / The answer came in a whisper . /// I wish I ... could remember . John , we must talk now . /// /Yes. / Bandicut frowned , wondering , how long had it been since the quarx had seen his own world ? A million years ? A hundred million ? Did he even have a world of his own ? /You must brief me , / he whispered . ///John . You will not be ... alone . Expect another . But you must be prepared to .. . take responsibility . ///  | Responsibility ? He swallowed , thinking  --  the Earth is in danger from some cosmic collision , and I 'm supposed to take responsibility ? This is madness . . . madness .. . ///John , the data that you hold in your mind ? /// /Data ? / Yes yes , of course , the ephemeris. /// I have marked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companion .. . will be able to give it to the translator . It must reach the translator ! /// /Right , / he whispered . He did n't know what else to say . He could n't quite believe this was happening . Another .. . new companion . . . what the hell did that mean ? ///And John , you must remember . EineySteiney pool ! /// /What ? ? / /// Remember it . It 's the most important thing . That , and the data . /// /Okay , / he whispered , bewildered . /Charlie  --  what did you mean when you said there would be . . . another ? Another what ? Another quarx ? / He felt a sudden physical weakness , and almost doubled over . ///Aw jeez , Bart  --  it 's gettin ' all fuzzy , /// the quarx groaned abruptly . /Charlie ? What are you doing ? What are you talking about ? / /// Yeah , real fuzzy-like . Kinda ' ... misty ' round the edges . /// The quarx was speaking in a drawl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from those goddamn old TV shows . Charlie loved that shit , he thought . ///Ahhhh , jeez , Bart the pain ! /// /Stop ! / he said . He was starting to become angry . /What the hell do you think you 're doing ? ? /  | /// I 'm not gon na make it , old buddy ? /// /Stop it , damn you ! / The quarx gasped , /// Let me  --  go out in style  --  John ? /// /NO , damn it ! / /// I 'm not gon na make it . Ithink this may be it .. Bandicut felt a sharp sinking feeling in his chest . /Goddamnit , do n't pull this shit on me ! Charlie ! / /// It 's such a beautiful view I just wish I could . . . aaahhhhhhhh . . . /// There was a gasping sound , then silence . Bandicut scowled , looking around the beach , as though he would find the quarx there . /Charlie ? Charlie ? Goddamnit ? ! / There was no answer , no stir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was he gone , then ? Was Charlie gone  --  the only alien in the solar system ? Bandicut did n't know what to think . He felt a profound confusion , and fear . Three heartbeats later , he heard a soft chuckle . /// Gotcha . /// For ten more heartbeats , he could n't speak . When he did , it was with barely controlled rage . /You asshole . You are a total asshole . Do you know that ? Was that supposed to be some kind of joke ? WAS IT. ? / The quarx whispered hoarsely , /// I 'm . . . sorry . I just thought , it 's my last chance . I 'm awfully mokin ' sorry . /// /Sorry ? That was the dumbest-ass stunt I 've ever seen ! Sorry ! Christ , I thought you were really gone ! / Bandicut picked up a handful of sand and flung it into the ocean . /Christ , Charlie ! / /// I really am . . . sorry . I do n't want to go , I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ///  | /Asshole ! / /// ? make it a little easier ? /// Bandicut let another handful of sand run through his fingers . He felt as if his thoughts were melting into the ocean along with that great crimson sun . /Lamebrained dingo-shit is what it was , Charlie. / /// I 'm sorry ... Bandie. /// He looked up into the sky , squinting . /Did I give you permission to call me that ? / he whispered , swallowing . There was no real answer , just a soft , distant sigh somewhere in the back of his mind . He felt suddenly drained of energy , as if something had gone out of him . He heard , or imagined that he heard , a single whispered word : Bye . /Charlie ? / The quarx did n't answer , and he started to get angry all over again . He got up and walked along the beach , waiting for the quarx to reappear . " Charlie ? " he called aloud . " Do n't you have to finish briefing me ? " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the water , then into the water , and felt the cool sea wash over his feet . The sunset was gorgeous , a flattened glowing orb settling into the ocean . " That 's something I really miss , from Earth , " he murmured . " I 'm sorry I yelled at you . I should n't have gotten so sore . Charlie ? You there ? " /Charlie , DAMN IT , answer me ! / In the silence that followed , he grew increasingly anxious . He felt none of the inner rustlings that marked Charlie 's presence . /Charlie ? / he whispered , pleading . /Arc you still there  --  somewhere ? / And that was when he knew . . . Charlie had whispered his farewell , and meant it . He was gone . Bandicut turned and walked the other way along the water 's edge . It hurt to take a breath in , and to let it out . He blew through his clenched fist and thought : I do n't even know if I should be happy or sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world for him to be gone . Maybe , for him , it 's a blessing . But .. . p 149 /Damn you , you never even told me where you were from  --  or about your people , or ? / It just all seemed . . . not just sad , but inappropriate , somehow . It should n't end this way . Not the first alien contact for all of humanity . No one else even knew about it . He had been the sole point of contact with the race of quarx . And now Charlie was gone . Bandicut sat down on the sand , trying to swallow . It was n't just the loss of an alien contact . It was the loss of a ... friend . He stared across the vast expanse of ocean at the fiery red orb , until the intensity of the glow began to hurt his eyes , and only after a few minutes did he begin to wipe at the streaming tears that were blurring his vision of the setting sun .  | HE REMAINED WHERE he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the sky had begun to darken . Finally he told the VR room to switch itself off , and he hung the sensory gear in the closet . Still , though , he lingered before leaving the room . He had no idea what to do with himself now . He was exhausted physically and emotionally , but sleep was out of the question ; so was eating . He knew he ought to think through the implications of what Charlie had said at the end : that he had to take responsibility , that there would be " another , " that he needed to get the data to the translator . EineySteiney . But he could n't ; he just could n't think about all that now . He left the room finally and found himself walking down the corridor toward the gym and the centrifuge room . Maybe that would be the best antidote : to put in some pounding physical exercise and just utterly drain himself . There was no doubt he needed the exercise . Maybe it would help him get his mind off Charlie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gym , he had to wait for a chance in the ' fuge room . He spent the time warming up on the leverbenches , doing shoulder stretches and waist flexes . He was  | aware of the desk scanner-robot peering his way from time to time and began , ridiculously , to feel self-conscious . He wondered if his inner distress was showing clearly enough on his face for even a robot to see it . Flushing , he stepped up his pace of exercise . If he had to look distressed , by God , it was going to be because he was pushing himself . He did n't need anyone nosing around asking what was wrong . Sweat beading on his forehead , he still could not keep from spinning his mental wheels , trying to think what to do next . He could n't keep his experience with the quarx a secret forever . If he was supposed to be taking responsibility , then he had to make decisions . Ultimately , this was something the world needed to know about : the first living contact with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was could figure out why the Earth was in danger . But whom could he tell , and with what for evi-dence  --  unless he led a search party back to the cavern and the translator ? But to do that , he would have to tell Cole Jackson . The man would never believe him ; and even if he did , Jackson would only look for some way to grab the credit , the way he did when that stranded Time-Life photographer was rescued two months ago  --  when he took a commendation " on behalf of " the two men who 'd acted , while he 'd stood around scratching his ass , making plans . Bandicut could imagine Jackson 's pleasure in taking credit for alien contact . But whom else could he tell ? Despite the fact that they were here on Triton to dig alien metals out of the ground , there was no department assigned the job of dealing with living aliens . That might be stupid , but there it was . That seemed to leave two other choices . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mind except psychosis ; and there was the tiny exoarchaeology group , where Julie Stone worked . He felt a certain appeal in giving the science people a chance before the  | marketing people took over . But exoarch was n't part of MINEXFO , and it would not be viewed favorably for him to tell exoarch instead of going through company channels . In any event , he had a hunch  --  Julie notwithstanding  --  that exoarch would think he was as crazy as a loon , just like everyone else . He knew if the situation were reversed , he would n't believe a story like his , not for a moment . He puffed , straining against the levers . " Mr. Bandicut ! " said a synthesized voice . " Do you wish to use the centrifuge or not ? There are others waiting . " " Huh ? " He sat up on the leverbench and peered toward the front desk . The scanner-robot was staring unblinking in his direction . " Okay . I 'm going , " he grunted , wiping his forehead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went through the sliding door into the ' fuge room . The centrifuge room rotated around the gym like a gigantic , inward-banked angel food cake . Bandicut paused on the wide , stationary inner track , then stepped out across the red , orange , and yellow transition bands , staggering a little as his weight increased by increments , each ring outward moving faster than the one before . He made his way to the green outer ring , which held the main .8-gee running track and an assortment of high-gee exercisers strung along its outer circumference . Taking a few deep breaths , he jogged up to speed , finding a gap among the other runners . The sensation of revolving was disconcerting at first , as he whizzed past a couple of people on the slower , inner bands . But he adjusted quickly , and began a steady , mindless pace , pounding his way around the track . He did n't speak to anyone , and did n't bother to count laps or keep track of his speed . The monitor on his wrist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over  --  if his knees did n't buckle under first . It was n't long before the burning in his lungs told him that he had become far too lax in his exercising ; he needed  | to do this more often . He tried to empty his mind , except for the physical ache . But inevitably his thoughts drifted back to Charlie , and to how he might locate Charlie 's translator and produce it as evidence of his discovery . Please do n't tell anyone . He stumbled , lost his balance with the Coriolis veering , and rolled off the track to the outside . Had he just heard a voice  --  a tiny whisper ? He thought it had sounded like the voice of Charlie . More likely , it was his memory of the quarx 's voice . His monitor was beeping furiously , his heart pounding . He grabbed for the mute switch on his wrist , and he searched frantically in his mind . /Charlie ? / he whispered . It took all of his self-control not to call the quarx 's name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulse in his eardrums . He dragged for breath in the heavy gravity . It must have been the strain , the lightheadedness from running . He had imagined the sound . " Hey  --  you okay there ? " One of the other runners was bending down next to him . " I , uh ? " he croaked , wheezing in another breath . The runner put his hands on his hips , catching his own breath . " Whooeee . I thought mebbe you were having some ? " " No ? " Bandicut panted , waving the other man on . " I 'm fine . Just a little . . . winded . " " ' Kay . See ya . " The runner jogged off again . Bandicut sat back on the padded sidestrip , watching the stream of workers jog past . His heart rate was coming down slowly . /Charlie ? / he whispered . /Did you plant that memory ? / He thought he heard a high keening sound , like his sinuses depressurizing ; then it was gone . Maybe it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quarx . He sighed and cursed and got to his feet . Maybe it was time he went to bed , after all .  | Stretching out in the privacy of his bunk , he knew that he was not going to be able to sleep yet . He pulled his notebook out of the cubby beside his head and , resting on one elbow , jacked it into the wall . He wanted to check the system board to see if Jackson and the department had left him any messages about their investigation . They had : Jackson wanted to know if he had heard anything in the rover before the nav and comm went out on him . He typed a short reply : No . He sent a separate query asking when they anticipated putting him back on survey duty . It was not that he had even the slightest idea what he would do when they put him back out there . But some of the posts on the gen-eral-comments board were from miners offering their services for survey driving , and it worried him that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charlie 's cavern . The little screen seemed to glow back at him like a living thing on his bunk . He paused in his browsing of messages . There was really very little that he was interested in here ; he was just postponing sleep . He was also , he realized , extremely tired . If nothing else , that made a fertile ground for silence-fugue . That was the last thing he wanted to deal with now . He unplugged the unit , stashed it in the cubby , and lay back , closing his eyes . Sleep did not come easily . He seemed surrounded by irritating noises , sounds he ordinarily did not notice at all : the voices of men coming and going in the dorm rooms , even the adjoining rooms ; the sounds of plumbing in the can , ten meters away ; even someone 's holovid , in this dorm room or another . It was certainly strange for him to be hearing all of these things through his privacy curtain , which ordinarily screened out all but the loudest sounds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too depressed to think anything more about it than how annoying it was . Even his own heartbeat seemed to thunder in his ears .  | He felt as though all of his senses , both inner and outer , were afire  --  as though Charlie , in his departure , had somehow flayed his nerve endings so that he would forever be adrift in a sea of noise , fretfulness , and chaos . /Damn you , Charlie , for leaving like that ... / His thoughts seemed to drift away like whispers on the wind , Damn you , Charlie ... damn you , Charlie ... and then it was gone , like the sound of a dream passing in the night . He thought he heard an answering whisper , Who is Charlie ? and he blinked his eyes in the dark and searched his mind , and wondered : indeed , who was Charlie ? And why did he come to me , and then leave before his work ? our work  --  was done ? And will I be hearing voices in my imagination for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of inevitability wash over him , saying , yes , you will . . . as he drifted off to sleep at last . It seemed only an instant later when he was startled awake by a gurgling sound : /// Where the ... ( glurrrk ) ... am I ? /// He heaved himself up on one elbow , staring into the near-total darkness of his bunk alcove . The tiny red clock readout provided the only light , glowing blood red as it floated in space beside him , telling him that it was 0447 , the middle of the night . What the hell had awakened him ? " Charlie ? " he called out softly . For a moment , through his grogginess , he felt the weight of his own stupidity . What was he doing , calling out aloud to a dead alien ? But he was certain he had heard something . There was another gurgling sound , like a clogged drain . He strained to hear . Was it coming from outside ? From the lavatory ? No .. . He wondered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? It did n't feel like it , but ... voices in the night ? Probably just a dream , for God 's sake . Was he losing the ability to  | distinguish between dream and reality ? Was it that hard , losing Charlie ? /// Char-leee ? /// Bandicut froze . That was a definite voice . /// Was that .. . what you called ? ? /// /Charlie ! / he screamed . He was suddenly gasping again , overwhelmed by a need to drag air into his lungs . /Charlie , is that you ? / /// I 'm  --  not sure ? /// /Charliiiiie ! What are you doing to me , damn you ? / He fell back on his pillow , holding his head in both hands . /Furgin ' hell , is this some kind of ? / He was interrupted by a stronger voice : /// Please please stop shouting , sir ! I must know  --  who you are ? /// Bandicut gasped breathlessly . Suddenly he realized that he felt a multiple bewilderment  --  his own , and someone else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , dizzily. /Charlie ? Is it really you ? Or ? / Time seemed suspended , through a long moment of uncertainty . Then a very soft , tentative voice said : /// Charlie ... ? Perhaps ... you could call me that . /// Bandicut felt a cold chill run down his back . /// Your name is . . . Bandicut . Yes ? /// /Yes , / he whispered . /But who ? ? / /// I think I .. . have memories of you , John Bandicut. /// Bandicut felt as if he were spinning in a centrifuge out of control , his mind staggering from unrelenting Coriolis veering . He lay back down .  | /// Can you tell me please ... what happened ? /// /What happened ? You died ! Last night ! / He felt his bewilderment rippling back upon itself . His thoughts flashed involuntarily back to Charlie 's death  --  reviewing the events as if in blazing holo . It was a disturbing , disorienting re-view  --  the death , and its emotional and physical effects . But there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charlie ? /// Something ... else ... happened . /// Bandicut lay helpless as the thing in his mind struggled to sort its way through the facts . /What else happened ? / Bandicut whispered . /// Not just . . . death . /// /No ? ? / /// ? Something- - quarx - -  I ... /// It seemed to run out of words . Bandicut whispered , /Please  --  just tell me  --  are you the Charlie I knew ? / There was another long hesitation . ... am uncertain . . . /// /But ? /  | ? I ? **13;243; **15;258; - you - -  once knew -- a Charlie ? . /// Bandicut struggled to keep from crying out his intense ... he did n't even know what the emotion was , just that it was building like a scream that wanted to get out , but could n't because a weight was sitting on top of it . He felt his breath rush in and out , and behind his closed eyelids , lights were flashing and he felt as if he were falling . . . /// What ? ?  | What is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jerked back to stillness , abruptly , as though a band of steel had clamped down upon his brain . He gasped , dizzily. /You . . . used to do that a lot more .. . gently , / he wheezed. /// ? ? ? /// He gulped . /Silence-fugue . It . . . hits me ... and it 's all I can do to . . . keep my head on straight until it passes . But you found a way to ? / ///I ? ? /// /You . Before you ? / he choked on the word / ? died ! / Bandicut felt himself suddenly burning with rage . /Before you started moking with my mind ! / /// ? I ? /// the creature gasped at his rage /// ? did nothing ? /// /Then ? / Bandicut whispered raggedly , /please tell me  --  who are you ? And where is Charlie ? / The quarx seemed stunned . Charlie transformed I am Iam not  | you may call me Charlie . /// Bandicut 's heart pounded. /// You still do n't ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe I do . He felt a powerful sensation of wheels shifting and spinning in his mind . /// Charlie died ? ? /// whispered the quarx. /Yes. / /// I am of the ... ashes ? /// Bandicut stared into the darkness . ///Now do you ... ? /// /Yes , / he whispered . /I think I do now. /  | WHEN THE ALARM chimed , he rolled out of his bunk with a groan . Although he 'd eventually sunk into a muddled slumber , he did not feel rested in the least . He considered calling in sick , but he did n't want to have to concoct reasons . Vague claims of insomnia were unlikely to cut much mustard with Dr. Switzer . He grabbed something to eat in the cafeteria and headed for the ready room . /// What is planned for today ? /// asked the quarx . Charlie  --  the new Charlie  --  had awakened somewhat clearer-headed , or at least more articulate , than he had been in the middle of the night . /I have to go to work , / @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He hauled his suit out of the locker . They had a lot to talk about , but now was hardly the time  --  and truthfully , he had n't much stomach for it . He wanted to pretend that Charlie-One was still with him , pretend that last night had n't happened . ///He ... we .. . did not mean for it to be disruptive . It 's unlikely that he wanted to die , you know . ///  | Bandicut grunted , hauling the bulky mining suit up over his shoulders . The last of the other workers had just disappeared out the airlock. /No , I suppose not. / And how am I going to get through this day ? he wondered . By pretending everything is okay ? By doing nothing that will take me even remotely closer to understanding  --  much less accomplish-ing  --  Charlie 's and my mission ? /Do you ? / he whispered , /know what Charlie knew ? Do you remember what we talked about ? Our . . . purpose ? / The answering voice sounded apologetic. /// I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . /// /Then he 's really gone ? Charlie ? Part of him , anyway ? / /// I am sorry . Was he . . . a good friend ? /// Bandicut sighed and did n't answer for a while , as he wrestled with the last fittings on his suit . /Nah , / he whispered at last . /Would a good friend have done something like that to me ? / Without waiting for an answer , he clamped his visor closed and hurried off to the airlock. /// It is not that I remember nothing . /// the quarx said , rather severely it seemed , as the air whispered out of the airlock. /// But rather that I need to consolidate pieces of my memory . /// Bandicut had noticed that this version of Charlie seemed to have a starchier disposition than the first Charlie's. /Pieces of your memory ? Is that going to take a long time ? I wish you 'd explain to me how you appeared out of the little pieces that Charlie left behind. / The quarx seemed to be groping for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | I did n't ... exactly appear out of his pieces . Jam him just not entirely . There is an oblique recurrency in our ... life cycle . /// Bandicut was watching the pressure readout in irritation . /What are you saying , you do n't really die ? / The quarx sounded offended . /// We certainly do die . Perhaps , though , the term " death " is misleading , in your language . There is a continuation , and an alteration in our ? /// His voice dropped to a wordless , gravelly moan , which pitched up and down like waves on an ocean . He paused , apparently deciding that he could not find the right word . /// I 'm afraid your language does n't quite suffice ? /// /Hey ! / Bandicut snapped . /I 'm so mokin ' sorry our language ca n't handle the reproductive cycle of mokin ' quarxes ! / He checked the last settings on his life support and savagely punched the airlock exit button . /// I did n't mean .. . actually I think you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I believe that 's truer to the spirit of both singular and plural . . . /// Bandicut ignored him and bounded with shallow , jogging leaps toward the crawler bay . Crawler Three was powering up as he reached the docking bay . He yelled to Bronson , hanging off the stem ladder . " Hold up ! " Bronson waved him away . " Go see Massengale ! " he called , his voice scratchy through the comm . " You 've been reassigned ! "  | Bandicut peered up at the crawler boss . " What ? Why ? " Bronson 's grinning eyes were just visible behind his visor . " I du n no . Prob'ly did n't like you learnin ' your job here so fast . Hell , he 's prob'ly disappointed you did n't fall off an ' kill your damn self . " " Yeah , " Bandicut muttered . " Okay , see you around . " Scowling , he turned back toward the airlock . " Hey , Bandicoot . " He swiveled back . " Yeah ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , for an outa-work survey jock . Take it easy , y'hear ? " He waved and clambered up the ladder to the top of the crawler . Bandicut stared after him for a moment , then shook his head and walked at a leisurely pace back toward the ready room . /// Is this what you would term ... a setback ? /// the quarx asked . He shrugged . /Damn near everything I 've been doing has been a setback , if you 're talking about our " mission . " Do you remember the last few days of work  --  what we 've been doing ? Charlie seemed to think he was learning something from it , though I 'll be joogered if I know what. / /// I remember those days .. . only vaguely . /// /Well , do you remember Herb Massengale ? / ///Um ... was n't he . . . some kind of ... asshole ? Is that the correct word ? /// Bandicut laughed out loud and punched the airlock control . /Okay , Charlie ! There is some of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pressurized room . Before unsuiting , he plugged his helmet comm into a wall jack and paged Herb Massengale . The voice that answered was flat and unpleasant . " That you , Bandicut ? " p 165 " Yeah , it 's me . I 'm in the ready room . Bronson said you wanted to talk to me . " " Get out of your suit and come to my office . " " Why did n't you tell me before I got suited up ? " " When you 're in charge , you can ask the questions . " " I see . " Jerk . " I 'll be there in a little while . " " Make it snappy , Bandicut. " /// This man does n't like you , does he ? /// Charlie noted in a concerned tone . He did n't bother to answer , but yanked his comm plug out of the wall jack and started unzipping his pressure suit . /// I suspect that he 's ... baiting you . Is that it ? /// Bandicut nodded silently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Massengale had in mind for him . And he was going to like it even less than the crawlers . Massengale did n't look up from his desk . " What took you so long ? " " I could have been here an hour ago , " Bandicut said evenly , " if you had n't ? " He paused and shrugged . Massengale drew a nostril-flaring breath and lifted his gaze to stare at Bandicut . " Siddown . " He jerked his thumb at a bench against the wall . /// What a shithead. /// Bandicut snorted , trying not to laugh . Massengale 's eyes narrowed . " Problem ? " Bandicut shook his head silently , turning away to walk to the bench . /Stuff it , Charlie , until we get out of here. / /// Even if he is a ? ? /// /Yes . Especially because that 's what he is . Anyway , how 'd did you get to be so good with the cuss words , all of a sudden ? / /// I 'm exploring prememories of your culture . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they not . /// Bandicut had to agree that they were . But he was aware that Massengale was watching him suspiciously . To camouflage the blank gaze that had undoubtedly come over him , he rubbed the side of his jaw as though smoothing out a facial tic . " So , " he murmured . " I assume you have some other work for me ? " " Yeah , " Massengale said . " I thought maybe you 'd been loafmg out there on the crawlers long enough , and it was time for you to earn your keep . Since your own department has n't seen fit to ask for you back . . . " He paused to appraise the effect of his words , but Bandicut returned his gaze expressionlessly . Massengale shrugged . " I need you in Shaft Three . I got men out with injuries , and they 're short-handed . " " I do n't know squat about deep mine work , " Bandicut pointed out . Massengale chuckled . " So what else is new ? " Bandicut flushed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just do n't screw anything up this time . " Massengale stared at him for a moment longer , and Bandicut could almost hear his thought : We do n't need any goddamn neurojack fairies down there , either , so whatever that look is on your face , wipe it off . But all Massengale actually said was , " There 's a supply van going out in twenty minutes . That ought a give you enough time to grab a suit . " Massengale 's lips curled into a faint smile . /That ought a give you enough time , / Bandicut mimicked , as he returned to the storeroom to check out a deepmine suit . /I 'd love to drop that guy down one of his own mine shafts. / /// In this gravity , would he not fall slowly ? I wonder if that would create the result you desire . ///  | /It was a rhetorical comment. / The first Charlie would have understood that , damn it . But Bandicut did n't have time to talk about it , and he did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The storeroom robot was handing him the components of his suit , and he did n't plan to step out of the ready room without thoroughly inspecting the pieces that would separate his hide from near vacuum . It was another thirty minutes before he was exiting through the airlock in search of the supply van . /// What 's different about this suit ? /// Charlie asked , as he strode down the departure dock . /A few more lights , more air , more protection against cave-in crushing , / Bandicut murmured . /// I see . Cave-in crushing ... ? /// /Do n't worry , it rarely happens. / Bandicut peered around , and fmally spotted the van in the glare of the floodlights . Two suited men were walking around outside it . /At least , I hope that 's true. / Charlie considered that for a long moment . /// Do I understand that as ... humor ? /// /Ha ha ha. / Bandicut waved to the apparent driver of the van . He was answered by a gesture to hurry up and get in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vehicle and hooked his wrists into the restraints . The van jerked into motion , and he watched in silence as they pulled out of the docks and drove to the south , away from the surface mines , toward Shaft Three . The ride was a short one . But Bandicut had a terrible sense of traveling a long way from where he wanted to go . A long way from Charlie-One 's cavern , a long way from the translator . A long way from understanding what the hell it was he was supposed to do  --  since Charlie-Two did n't seem to know .  | Before he knew it , he was hanging on to a handhold lift , descending into the sub-Triton depths . As he stepped off the lift , he was some hundred meters beneath the surface , far deeper than he had been in Charlie 's cavern . With vapor lamps arrayed everywhere , it was considerably brighter here than Charlie 's cavern had been ; but he could n't help shivering at a certain feeling of deja vu . As he peered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls here contained less ice and more rock than Charlie 's cavern . The ceiling had been laser-fused for structural strength , but it still made him nervous . /Does this remind you of anything ? / he asked Charlie , wondering if the quarx had memories of their first meeting . /// Yes . . . /// the quarx said weakly. /What 's the matter ? / Bandicut was puzzled by Charlie 's abruptly subdued demeanor. /You do remember meeting me  --  with your translator  --  do n't you ? / The quarx seemed to have trouble answering . He clearly found this place disturbing , for some reason . /Say , you are n't claustrophobic or anything , are you ? / /// No , I ? /// Bandicut frowned , beginning to wonder if something really was wrong with the quarx. /You lived in a cavern smaller than this , for millions of years . Do n't you re-member ? / /// Yes . . . I remember .. . But this ... reminds me of .. . something else ... /// The quarx 's voice trailed off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gone off somewhere and disappeared . They probably had assumed that he knew where he was going . /Reminds you of what ? / he asked absently , wondering where in the hell he was supposed to go now . p 169 /// ... of ... /// The alien could n't seem to finish its thought . Someone who looked as though he might be the mining foreman was walking in Bandicut 's direction along the corridor shaft . Down at the far end of the tunnel , Bandicut glimpsed a flickering of light and shadow , men working . /What 's it remind you of ? / he muttered . /// Of the war , /// Charlie whispered . Bandicut felt a sudden chill . /What ? / he asked softly . Something had been touched deep in the quarx 's memory , something very sharp and painful , something that fitted with this underground image of tunnels in the rock and ice . Before he could ask , he felt a sudden sense of memories falling into place like the tumblers of a lock , and the quarx @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burrowing deep , very deep to avoid the destruction at the end . /// Bandicut fought off a wave of dizziness . The quarx 's voice carried great waves of sorrow and fear . Images flickered in Bandicut 's mind , too quickly to follow ; but he recognized glimpses of what the first Charlie had shown him  --  memories of Triton millions of years ago , in another star system , at war . The end of the Rohengen civilization . This time the memory seemed to carry a keener sorrow  --  as if the sight of this mining tunnel touched a nerve that ran darker and deeper than any he 'd touched before . /Charlie ? Are you okay ? / /// What do you mean ? /// the quarx whispered hoarsely. /You do n't sound so good . Are you having some kind of flashback or something ? / He felt the quarx flinch , and an image flickered in his mind of someone running , desperately running , fleeing from approaching explosions . The  | image vanished , squelched at its source , and he sensed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /Charlie ? / There was no answer . He had a fleeting impression of the quarx burrowing , curling into a ball , pulling away from him . Great , he thought . He heard a voice on the comm . " That you , Jimmy ? " It was the suited man , approaching . " Who is that ? " " Bandicut ! " he called back . " Herb sent me down . " " What the hell for ? " " How the hell would I know ? He said you were shorthanded . I 'm supposed to help out . " " Aw , you mean I 'm supposed to train a new guy , on top of everything else ? Man , I need this like I need hemor-rhoids ? " " Listen ! " Bandicut flared . " I did n't ask to be sent down here ! Who is that Jones ? " " Yeah , it 's Jones . " The foreman waved for Bandicut to join him . " Hey , nothin ' personal , Bandicut . I 'm sure as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's just that we 're a little busy here . We 're on a bum streak and the man up in the office is tellin ' us to move our butts and get the output up , and what does he know about mining ? Know what I mean ? " " Yeah . I know . " Bandicut could now read the man 's name stenciled on his suit : JQ Jones . At that moment , he felt a shiver run up his spine . It had nothing to do with Jones . It had everything to do with where he was , and why , and the fact that he was separated by a pane of cryosafe plastic from everyone around him . No connection . . . linkage ... neurowarmth . . . neurostim .. . Oh no. /Charlie ! / He could n't feel the quarx ; Charlie had withdrawn into his own memories ; but he felt something else , something disturbingly familiar . There seemed to be a distance growing , not quite physical or tangible , but a distance nonetheless , between himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , himself and anything else that might touch him . The silence-fugue was just in its beginning phase , but he already felt a certain comfort in the familiarity of the sensation . " Here y'go , Bandicut . Want to help us out here ? " Jones stopped beside a bank of equipment which , as far as Bandicut could tell , might have been used for drilling or for dishwashing . Was he going to be expected to operate this stuff ? Then he saw that Jones was pointing not at the equipment , but just beyond it to what looked like a pile of rock rubble . A small , hunchbacked robot was picking its way across the pile . " Quasimodo here is sorting through these tailings for traces of metal that might have gotten through the big processor . You want to help it ? " Bandicut 's head was buzzing . He was n't sure he had heard correctly . " Say again ? You 're joking , right ? " " Naw , our big sorters sometimes miss bits that are worth as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just dump it here and let a robot claw through it ? " Bandicut felt great bubbles of disbelief billowing open in his head . He 'd thought he understood how things worked around here , but was it possible they were even more idiotic than he 'd supposed ? Jones shrugged without apparent humor . " Quasimodo here does a pretty good job  --  bit of a perfectionist , really . He 'll show you what to do . " Bandicut 's vision flickered with little tongues of flame . He was to be a servant and apprentice to a robot ? " Now , wait a second ? " " I tol ' you , I do n't have anyone here to train you . " Jones grinned . " If you get real good at this , maybe we 'll promote you tomorrow . Now , I got ta go . Lunch break is at eleventhirty Zulu . " Bandicut stared at the foreman 's dwindling back and thought , time is fleeing , and this is what I 'm doing ? Charlie ? He turned to stare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nondescript , with a couple of flickering lights and three eye lenses . As it rose from a crouch , it looked like a tiny , ancient man , plucking at the rocks . It examined the chunks one by one , then flicked them aside into the shadows . Bandicut brushed off the top of a small boulder and sat down , blinking . He was casually aware that the robot was looking almost alive to him , and for that matter , the corridors were starting to remind him of a hive maze , and his safety-net Charlie was nowhere to be found ; and he was dimly aware that he was teetering on the brink of a potentially major silence-fugue , perhaps as bad as the one that had sent him careening toward Charlie 's cavern in the first place . He had no power to take any action , but he watched what was happening in his mind with keen interest and an avid curiosity . Spectator mode : the kind of silence-fugue that he liked best , really .. . He felt a little shiver from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the robot was utterly still . It was watching him . It extended one telescoping arm and poked at a chunk of rock . " Yeah ? " Bandicut said dreamily . " What do you want ? " The robot raised its arm and pointed at him . He chuckled , " Get outa here . " The robot hooted softly . Bandicut squinted at the metal creature , and imagined an army of them crawling around , scrabbling at loose rock in search of stray grains of metal which they would deposit in a small pile . He imagined a storm gathering up the meager collection in a whirlwind and blowing them away as fast as the robots could collect them , all of their efforts coming to nothing as they dug and probed and toiled , for nothing at all . Beware your state of mind . The warning thought ? from Charlie ? ? flickered past and vanished as he rose and joined the robot , giggling silently . p 173 A remaining sane corner of his mind recoiled in horror , then spun away in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked up a rock . " I got one , too , " he murmured . " Pretty , is n't it ? " The robot seemed to shake its head in disgust . It took the rock from him and turned it over in its mechanical hand . " Scanning , " it muttered . " No metal . " It turned and tossed the rock onto the refuse pile . " Next ? " " Next ? Next what ? " The robot stared at him expectantly . " You want me to stand here and hand you rocks ? So I can look like a furgin ' hunchback , too ? Whaddya think we invented robots for , anyway ? " Quasimodo peered at him a moment longer , then gave a little jerk which might have been a shrug and turned back to its work , paying him no further notice . Bandicut heard laughter . He saw Jones a little way up the corridor , walking back toward him . " Okay , Bandicut  --  I was n't really gon na leave you there all day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do . " Jones waved him onward . Following Jones , with a dark glance back at Quasimodo , Bandicut swiveled his head back and forth , glaring at the faces peering down at him from the walls , the ghosts maybe of all the aliens who once lived here , billions of years ago . He imagined them falling in behind him . No , no , he wanted to tell them . This is taking me farther from the answers ! Go back ! But he decided to say nothing . They would be gone soon , he knew . And so would the fugue . Soon .  | " DOWN HERE , " JONES said , pointing to a shaft . Bandicut stepped carefully forward and peered down into the shaft . It was ten or twenty meters deep . A cable descended from a hoist overhead , down through the center of the shaft . He could see movement below , the shadows of men working nearby , and occasionally an elbow or backpack jutting into view . His nerves jangled ; he imagined fish with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Uh-huh . " " It 's a little makeshift because the main hoist is broken , so we 've got this rig here for the time being . " " And you want me to ... run it ? " " Naw  --  hell no ! " Jones laughed . " You think we can afford to have someone here running a stupid hoist ? We got real work for you to do , down in the laser shaft . " Bandicut swallowed , and said nothing . " Let me just show you how this thing works , so you can get yourself in and out . " Jones pointed to a grimy panel of knobs and levers . Bandicut peered and saw the knobs turn to little faces . He thought one of the levers waved . Hi , he thought . He had just enough presence of mind not to wave back . Jones was activating the hoist . After glancing down the p 175 shaft to see that the way was clear , he pushed a lever and the cable began rising . " Here you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . Simple enough ? " He turned his shiny visor toward Bandicut . " Simple , " Bandicut whispered . " Then let 's go . " Jones grabbed the cable and swung out over the shaft . He sank quickly . Bandicut stepped after him and clung as they descended deeper into the mine . The shaft surrounded him like a tomb , then opened out into a cavern full of lights and suited men . There was very little headroom once clear of the hoist , which gave a closedin feeling to the place , even though the room opened out horizontally for tens of meters . Mining holes were being bored outward in a radial fashion from the outer circumference of the cavern . Vapors from probing lasers periodically boiled out in great clouds , obscuring the view . Bandicut shivered with a sudden feeling that this was where the real heart of the Triton operation was located . It was in these deep mines that the most promising concentrations of Tritonmetal had been detected , the melted and twisted veins of living communities . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Rohengen , before they had been consumed by their war . And no one else here  --  no one human , anyway  --  had the slightest inkling of the history that he saw in this place . He shuddered with a sudden intensity , and realized that the quarx , deep in his mind , was reacting violently to those last thoughts . He had a sense of tightly contained memories and feelings on the verge of erupting . " Bandicut , for Chrissake , come on ! " Jones was gesturing impatiently from halfway down a work line , where a dozen men were operating panels for the remote mining equipment . " Right ? " " Hey , Bandie  --  how you makin ' out , man ? " He heard a familiar voice , and swung around , looking for its source .  | Finally he spotted Gordon Kracking waving from behind a large computer console . " Okay , uh . . . What are you doing here , Krackey ? " " Helpin ' ' em straighten out this mess of a control sys-tem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plasma laser flickered in a horizontal shaft . A conveyor belt was carrying a continuous load of rock and ice past a sensor bank for scanning and sorting . Bandicut blinked , imagining his friend as a great bird , flapping his wings and flying away in frustration from this place . He imagined Jones 's gaze as a great invisible laser beam , cutting Krackey down and then turning on him , if he did n't move " Comin , JQ ! " He hurried after the foreman , ignoring the curious glances of the other miners . Jones was standing just beyond one of the main tunneling stations . He was fiddling with a portable control stand connected by cable to a small drilling laser . The laser , mounted on a self-propelled dolly , was parked just inside a small , fresh-looking horizontal opening . The shaft in the cavern wall was about a shoulder 's width across . Its interior was dark . Jones turned his helmeted head toward Bandicut and hooked a gloved thumb toward the small shaft . " We 'll be setting up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but here 's the pilot hole so we can get some readings on any veins along the radial . This ought a be right up your alley , Bandicut . The instruments here 're just like the ones on your survey rigs . " Bandicut stepped cautiously past the mining operation situated just to the left of the new shaft . The flashes and boiling vapors of the mining laser gave him a feeling of walking through the set of a holomovie , but he knew better . This was serious business down here ; deep mining was the most dangerous operation on all of Triton . The lasers were mounted on stationary pedestals , their radiant output focused and guided by mirrors . The powerful beams glowed and shimmered within the shafts like exotic weap-  | ons beams , glittering dully off the sluglike vapor-exhaust ducts . One of the men operating the laser was Mick Eddison , the miner who 'd given him such a hard time in the dorm the other day . Bandicut shuddered , thinking , they let people like him control these life-threatening machines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was flipping switches . Bandicut stepped close and peered at the instruments . Actually , they bore little resemblance to the readouts he was used to , but he assumed he could figure out how they worked . " Okay , " he said . " What you 're gon na do is , walk this baby straight into the pilot shaft , and just drill straight out on a narrow beam . It 's autoguided . You record the findings here . " Jones pointed to the instruments , then looked at him . " Think you can handle that ? " Whether it was John Bandicut responding or some inner creature released by the silence-fugue , he answered casually , " No problem . " Before Jones could say another word , he flicked on the laser . Jones backed hastily out of the way . " Be careful with that thing , " he yelled , then vanished back into a swirling cloud of vapor . Be careful ? Bandicut thought , driving the laser forward into the shaft , guided by images on a small monitor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faint , mewling protest somewhere deep in the mines of his own thoughts ; but perhaps that was the quarx , working out its own problems . But he could n't count on the quarx ; the Charlie he knew was gone , and he was on his own . The tunnel was not yet very deep , reaching only a few meters . The guide beams glinted red , sparkling through the thin haze that filled the tenuous air , marking the track of the invisible infrared and ultraviolet beams that bored and probed and sent back reflections to the sensors . The rock  | and ice layers scintillated , sparkling of emerald and ruby and sapphire ; it was a pretty show for Bandicut , but also information for the recorder . If there were veins of metal , even trace residues , the spectra would be detected in the return beams . For a time , he was boring through rock , his laser slowly deepening and widening the hole before advancing . Then he struck ice and a vapor cloud billowed out of the shaft , obscuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , he glimpsed a dancing display of fluorescence and refraction in the monitor , deep in the hole . He was dazzled by the sight ; it reminded him of the image Charlie had shown him in their first meeting  --  what a quarx might look like , if it existed in material form . Was he imagining it , or did he feel Charlie-Two trembling ? He blinked as the laser licked at ice and rock , melting and vaporizing , hollowing out the tunnel . He glanced up from the monitor to peer directly into the borehole . He saw faces peering back from the inner walls of the shaft . There was Charlie-One as he might have appeared as a human : a trifle pudgy and world weary , with thinning flyaway hair , but a gleam in the eye and a quip on his tongue . And there was Charlie-Two , narrow and stern , with dark , strictly kempt hair , and eyes that bored into Bandicut 's , trying to understand Both faces flickered and melted in the laser heat , and turned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spurting out to the sides . " Bandicut ! What the hell are you doing ? " He started and realized that his hands were working the controls of their own accord . Jones strode out of a cloud of steam like a creature from an old movie . What was he doing ? " Are you falling asleep at that goddamn thing ? " he heard , and he blinked and saw that he had taken the laser off autoguide and let it wander , hollowing out the walls , creating a pool of melted ice that was now hardening to a p 179 slick surface . He snapped the laser off and backed it out . He peered into the tunnel in dismay . It was now almost big enough for a man to walk into , if he got up there and crouched low . Too big . Jones stared into the tunnel , shaking his head . " Jesus , Bandicut , I thought I could trust you to do this simple little ? " " Did I ever say I was a miner ? " Bandicut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to see ? ! " Jones gave up with an audible sigh . " All right , never mind . Now that you 've got it so big , we need to get a robot in there to check it out . " His voice sharpened . " Commlink Echo , Robot Delta Mike Four , report to my location . Coper-nicus  --  you got that ? " Bandicut heard a drumtap in reply , and a few moments later , a small , upright robot with four cone-shaped wheels lumbered out of a cloud of vapor at the next work station and stopped in front of Jones . " With you , boss , " it twanged . Jones pointed . " I want you to go into this borehole and do a short-profile type-B spectrascan . Got that ? " Copernicus drumtapped acknowledgment . Using its upper appendages , it lifted itself into the shaft , then reconfigured itself into a horizontal attitude , one pair of cone wheels stretching forward . A cluster of lights on its nose blinked on , and it rolled forward into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robot 's scanning lights glinted and reflected back out of the tunnel . Another memory was being touched here ; he felt Charlie twisting in pain . /You okay there ? / he whispered nervously . An image flickered in his mind : the quarx , in its Rohengen host , sprinting down a passageway , lights flashing and ground trembling . They were under attack , underground , running for cover ; but this was the wrong direction . There was a synthetic creature ahead of them ; they were trying  | to save it . For some reason it was special . . . it was a coworker , a friend . They ran , hoping to catch it , to bring it back to safety . There was a blinding light , and the ground shook And everything changed forever for the quarx . It was all gone in that flash : not just the robot-friend and the corridor it had been running through , but all hope for the Rohengen , for the future of quarx and host alike . The image blurred , as though obscured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . But the host was injured and dying . It barely made it through quaking underground corridors to the deep shaft where the quarx 's translator was hidden . Then the host died , releasing the quarx to the translator , and quarx and translator were falling , falling . . . plunging toward the center of the moon , away from the battle and the terror . . . but it was all gone , everything that it had lived and hoped for , its only friends .. . A squawk on the comm made Bandicut blink . It was the robot , chirping . Through the haze of confusion , he heard it calling . . . loss o f traction , adhesion t o ice ... caught .. . trapped .. . Trapped , and it needed help . Before Jones could respond with any sort of instruction , Bandicut pushed the laser-probe aside , clawed for purchase on the lip of the borehole as he climbed up , crouching as he made his way into the tunnel to help the robot .. . " ? what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No need to answer , got to get to the robot before it was injured , damaged , destroyed . . . lights flashing here , rock trembling . . . there it was , glinting just beyond the narrow constriction where the tunnel was carved out of rock , before the ice pocket . Bandicut crouched and stretched forward , and yes , it was awfully icy here , he 'd really burnished it to a slick surface , but he could almost reach the robot . . . give it a good yank before the big flash came to  | end everything . He had his hand on it and felt a sudden flush , and a tingle going down his arm . . . the quarx was stirring , with some kind of reflex , trying to reach out to communicate with the thing . BANDICUT7 " Jones bellowed . And he finally , dimly realized what he was doing . It was sheer idiocy ; he could get stuck here himself . He was caught in the quarx 's memory of a desperate need to save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real danger . And even if it was , so what ? /Charlie , / he whispered , /did you want me to do this ? ? / The answer rattled up faintly , from somewhere deep in his mind : /// No , but ... what are you . . . ? /// The scanning lasers on the robot suddenly rotated and flashed back off the ice , dazzling him . The quarx writhed ... the destruction of everything .. . Bandicut shuddered and squirmed back . He twisted , glimpsing where Jones was standing at the entrance to the borehole , yelling at him . " Are you delirious ? Get out of there ! " Bandicut shuffled , crouching , toward the foreman . He heard himself croaking , " No , no , not delirious ? " he gasped . " It 's this damn alien in my ? " /// NO ! /// shrieked the quarx , and did something inside Bandicut 's head . His vision flickered off and on once , then went black as he fainted . It was only for an instant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for his feet to shoot out from under him on the ice . He skidded feet first toward the end of the tunnel and Jones 's head  --  and the mining laser just beyond Jones . He clawed futilely  --  so light in this gravity He flew out of the shaft , airborne , and Jones hit him with a body blow to deflect him , and he careened into the cavern wall and bounced back toward the blazing light . He  | screamed and stuck out a foot  --  and caught it on the laser 's pedestal , then slammed into the pedestal before dropping in a crumpled heap to the floor . Pain blazed up his leg , and he cried out , once -- before the quarx , panicked , shut off the pain impulses ; and then his consciousness , too .  | HE BECAME AWARE of voices before he knew where he was . They seemed to be discussing whether or not to get him unsuited before taking him to the infirmary . " It 'll just get in their way , " someone was saying . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " someone else answered . " Whaddyou think we 'll do to that if we try to take this suit off ? They got nano-shit that can do that , in the infirmary . " A heavy voice cut in , " I do n't want this suit ruined down there . They ai n't gon na give a flyin ' horse-moke about the equipment . " " Have a little heart , Herb ! The guy 's hurt ! " That sounded like Krackey . " Yeah , well , he may be hurt , but that do n't make him any less of a dumb fucker , " the heavy-sounding voice retorted . " Imagine goin ' on shift with a fever of a hundred ' n ' four and not tellin ' anyone ! Serves him right he almost got hisself killed . " Massengale . That last idiot was Massengale . " Hey , come on , will you ? He was probably too feverish to know he was sick . " Bandicut 's eyes blinked open . His visor had been pushed  | up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How 'd he get here ? he wondered vaguely . He groaned aloud and fended off the hands that were trying to remove his helmet . With a Herculean effort , he shoved it off himself . He felt a region of numbness around his left ankle . He tried to recall what had happened , and found his memory a feverish muddle . He remembered the silence-fugue . And he remembered the quarx shutting him down like an overloaded circuit . /// You were in severe pain . It seemed the best course of action . Are you okay now ? /// " Awww , too bad ! He woke up , " Massengale remarked . Bandicut tried to raise his head to glare , but the supervisor was already on his way out of the room . " Stupid stoker , " he grunted . He shifted his gaze to see who else was here with him . Krackey was the only one he knew . " Ah , man ! " he sighed . " Take it easy , there , Bandie , " Krackey said worriedly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It must hurt like a bastard , but we do n't want to do nothin ' until the meds get a look at you . " Great , he thought . The meds . The same meds who 'd tried to fix his neuros . He wondered if the quarx could do anything to help . /// I can keep the pain turned off , as I 'm doing now . That 's about all , I think . /// He sighed and forced a grin in Krackey 's direction . " It 's ... not too bad , " he said , realizing suddenly that it was true . He felt disoriented , but there was very little physical pain , except for a hollow sort of emptiness below his left knee . He wondered if that was what a phantom limb felt like to someone who 'd lost a leg . " Ho , man , Bandie ! If you 're not in some serious pain , it must be because of that fever . " Krackey looked at the firstaid monitor and shook his head . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . What happened ? And what the hell were you doing , working , if you were sick like that ? " Sick ? he thought . Fever ? Had he actually been delirious with fever , instead of silence-fugue ? That , somehow , would be easier to take . /// Uh , no  --  sorry . I gave you the fever as an excuse for your behavior . What were you thinking of trying to pull a robot out by its hind legs ? /// /Thinking ? Did n't you notice , I was out of my mind with fugue ? / He remembered the quarx 's flashback-induced silence . /Anyway , where were you ? You 're supposed to help me out when these things happen. / /// I am ? I do n't have much recollection of that . I suppose ... I was a trifle indisposed for a while there . /// Bandicut felt movement , and realized suddenly that he was on a gurney , being rolled toward the door . Krackey was walking alongside him . The door opened and two medtechs came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't go walking out of here like that , " one of them said . " Your boss said to tell you to go back to work , " said the other . That was when Bandicut noticed that the miners were all still suited , except for their helmets . " I 'll check in on you as soon as I can , " Krackey promised , with a wave . " Do n't worry  --  these guys will have you riveted back together in no time . Just take it easy and get over that flu ! " Bandicut blanched as the techs sped him through the door and down the corridor . " No way ! " he yelled , shaking . " No nanomeds ! " " Oh , come on , Bandicut . We can have you back at work in two days if you just let us ? "  | Bandicut flailed an arm , clenching a fist in warning . He started to sit up , but a pair of strong arms grabbed him and held him down on the table . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure on his chest . Dr. Switzer 's face came into view over him . He was a stocky man with thinning silver hair , probably in his late fifties . What the hell a man his age was doing out here on Triton , Bandicut hated to think . Probably barred from practice on all the other inhabited worlds . Switzer peered at him through his black-rimmed glasses , frowning . " Still ca n't forgive and forget , eh , John ? " Bandicut grunted . " Yeh , " he managed , holding back a dozen harsher answers . " I guess that 's it . " " Tsk , tsk . " Switzer moved away , shaking his head . " Well ... we would n't want to give you something that would cause you any psychological side effects , I suppose . " Bandicut raised his head suspiciously . He did n't like the sound of that . As senior medical officer on Triton , Switzer approved or disapproved everyone 's fitness-for-duty status . Medically and psychologically . " What 's that mean ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned back with an alarming-looking clamping device in his hand . " I 'm just trying to save you pain , that 's all . Now we 'll have to set that bone the old-fashioned way , and it 'll take you a good four or five days to heal well enough to work . I suppose you can use the time to catch up on your reading . Jean , give him the injection , please , " Switzer said brusquely . Bandicut swiveled his head , but the nurse had already jammed the syringe into his leg . He felt a rush of giddiness . What the hell was that ? he managed to think , before the sensation swept him away like a flickering holochannel , removing him from any awareness of his surroundings . /// May I ask a question ? /// /What question ? What 's going on here ? Why ca n't I see anything ? Did you do that to me ? /  | /// It was the injection . I merely organized the effect slightly , so that we could use this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , anyway . /// /Thanks a bundle . Look , I need to know what they 're doing to me . I do n't trust them . They are n't shooting nanomeds into me , are they ? / /// I do n't think so . . . /// A small , framed image flicked on , like a monitor in one corner of a darkened control room . He could see the doctor and nurse and medtechs moving around him , stretching his leg out in some sort of tension device enclosed within a sensor array . It was fascinating to watch . . . until he remembered that it was his broken ankle they were stretching and twisting . Suddenly he preferred talking with the quarx. /You said you had a question ? / /// Yes . What are these nanomeds ? Why are you so afraid of them ? /// Even in the darkness and peace of the anesthesia-gloom , he would have winced if he could have . /// Your reaction to them is pronounced . /// /Yeah , / he muttered . /Yours would be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did to me. / /ill ca n't ... locate the memory . What are they ? /// /Submicroscopic repair units  --  self-replicating robots the size of large molecules , programmed with medical instructions and injected into the body to make repairs . There 's practically nothing they ca n't fix ? / /// Then what ? ? /// / ? in theory , / he fmished acidly . /// Oh . Then they do n't always work ? /// /No , they don't. / He tasted the bitterness and anger all over again . /They 're only as good as the programming patched into them , see . And these quacks used them to try  | to fix some damage to my neurojack implants. / Even his mind-voice trembled as he remembered , for Charlie 's benefit , what had happened . . . as he remembered the terrible shearing away of his ability to connect , to link in to that infinite world of .. . /// And the attempt failed ? /// the quarx interrupted . /You saw it , / he said savagely . /You saw the silencefugue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the job so badly that I can never use a neuro again ! Do you know what it 's like to have that . . . taken from you . . . once you 've ... / His words failed him , as he remembered the pain and the humiliation of losing the neurolink that had made him a highly valued survey pilot , equally skilled in the cockpit and the datanet. /// I believe I can imagine your pain , /// the quarx answered softly . Bandicut was startled by the answer ; then he glimpsed an impression of what it was like for a quarx to lose a host , to lose his only direct connection to life , to the rest of the physical universe except through the mechanical translator , to lose the one being who provided intimacy and immediacy of thought . ///And my predecessor .. . helped you to bridge that gap . Is that correct ? /// /Yes , / Bandicut whispered , envisioning the link that Charlie-One had created to the datanet. /Yes , that was very ... satisfying. / He swallowed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you could ? ? / He felt the quarx 's thoughts shifting and adjusting  --  and he realized that Charlie-Two had been growing , unfolding , remembering , and learning ever since his awakening . Perhaps this Charlie had potential , after all . /// I do n't know . ///  | /Oh. / He sighed softly . /I guess I should n't have ex-pected ? / /// But I 'd be willing to try . /// Bandicut felt his heart skip . It took him a moment to remember that it was as much a part of the quarx 's plan as his . But that was okay . Why should n't the quarx benefit , too ? /// But now , I think you need to pay attention to the docs . It looks like they 're trying to wake you up . /// /Mm ? / He looked back at the little monitor that the quarx had given him , and saw the faces of the nurse and medtechs peering down at him . He felt a stirring of sensation , and . . . a lance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connection . /// The pain faded , and in place of it he felt the stirrings of muscular ability . His eyelids were fluttering . The small monitor image grew to fill his vision . " You okay there ? " someone was saying . " Ahh ? " he grunted . It was n't the pain that made him grunt , it was the difficulty of regaining control over his body . " Take it easy , " said Switzer 's gravelly voice . " It 's going to hurt some , until you heal . " Bandicut nodded , his head heavy on the table . " What was that stuff ? " he breathed . " Hah . Escalomethorphin . Worked like a charm , did n't It ? " Switzer stepped up , beaming . He seemed proud of the way they had knocked him out in a matter of seconds . " We got your leg set , and you 're wearing a fastract unit . If you do n't mind a little pain , we can let you walk out of here . " Ile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan on working or doing anything hard for at least four days , maybe five . " " I was n't  --  ow ! What the hell was that ? " He looked  | down at his leg , ignoring Switzer 's cackle , and saw that the nurse had just stuck him with another syringe , a big one . Switzer clapped him on the shoulder . " Just some hormone and mineral supplements , to help the fastract do its job . Here , try standing up . " He grabbed Bandicut 's right arm and motioned to one of the medtechs , who grabbed the left . " Swing your legs off the table  --  atta ' boy . " Bandicut nearly fainted as they spun him around and sat him up . Charlie 's command over the pain pathways was uncertain , and for a second he felt a searing pain roar up his leg until it tingled in his ear . " Uh ? " " That 's it . Can you stand ? " /// Slowly ! /// He slid from the table with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charlie managed to kill the pain just as his weight came down on both legs , so it was mainly the anticipation of pain , rather than pain itself , that made him shudder . Still , he was grateful for the low Triton gravity . " Okay ? " asked Switzer . " Yeah , " he whispered . " Good . Here 's an instruction sheet on the fastract . " Switzer waved a paper at him . " You 've got to keep it at the right tension level , or you 'll be back here in even worse shape . And no centrifuge until I say so . " " Right . " What do you think I am , a moron ? " Just follow those instructions , and take these ? " Switzer handed him a huge bottle of pills " ? and come back in two days so I can see how you 're doing . " He hesitated . " Sooner  --  only if you have to . " Bandicut nodded , glancing around at the otherwise empty infirmary offices . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Switzer was rumored to spend extensive periods of leisure time in the VR facilities . Some sort of golf game , apparently . " Right , " he answered . " Only if I have to . Would n't want to impose upon your services ? " p 191 Switzer 's gaze darkened almost imperceptibly . ///Are you baiting him now ? This is a very interesting dynamic . /// Bandicut sighed . /Oh , shut up , will you ? / To the doctor , he said , " Just joking , you know . " " Yes , " said Switzer , who clearly understood exactly what he 'd meant , and did n't much like it . He squinted at Bandicut and said , " I wonder if we should have you come back in for some neurological retesting . I would n't want to think that you had n't completely recovered from your prior ... unfortunate . . . accident . Perhaps we should make sure that there 's nothing funny going on . " He tapped the side of his head meaningfully . /// What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a panic . " What do you mean by that ? " Bandicut asked simulta-neously . " Well , you were picked up with a temperature of a hundred and four . By the time you were rolled in here , you were down to one-zero-two . Now you 're back to ninetyeight point seven . " Switzer shook his head , turning away with his clipboard . " That 's just not natural . " /// Oh . /// Bandicut shifted his attention . /You did that , too ? You shut it off that fast ? / /// I , well .. . I was trying to give you a cover for the accident .

Switzer turned back , glaring . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . Go take in ... whatever it is you like to do . " He coughed and hurried into his office , leaving Bandicut standing , wobbling slightly , with the nurse . With a faint smile at the nurse 's bemused expression , he turned and hobbled with a low-gravity bounce out of the infirmary . /I think I want a beer , / he said , working his way toward the rec lounge . The quarx was silent for a moment , before saying , /// I find I have some pharmacological data in my memory . I 'm not sure that it would be a good idea , with that medication you 're on . /// Bandicut frowned . /Ca n't you just take care of any side effects ? / /// I 'm not a miracle worker . I 'm just an alien . /// /Ha ha. / Bandicut chuckled , then realized that the quarx had not meant the statement as a joke . , Well , okay  --  if not a beer  --  what , then ? / /// Well ... at some point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EineySteiney pool . /// /All right. / /// But first , how about taking me to the place where my predecessor . . . /// /Yes ? / /// ... linked you in. /// Bandicut smiled and hobbled a little more quickly down the corridor .  | SETTLING INTO A booth just off the lounge , Bandicut put on the headset and waited for the quarx to begin . /Well ? / Charlie hesitated . /// Actually , I do n't seem to remember how he did it . Do you ? /// /Me ? Hell , no .

The quarx dived into the datastream , carrying Bandicut faster than he could follow with his thoughts .

The quarx darted from stream to stream , dipping and sampling , siphoning information that left Bandicut dizzily bewildered .  | Finally he asked , /Do you know what you 're looking for ? / The quarx hummed distractedly. /// Not specifically .

The cowboy turned , grinned toothily , and the viewpoint shifted to closeup , and in the dark pupils of the cowboy 's eyes Bandicut saw the exploding fire of a quarx in its native reality . And his heart skipped , because he felt the first Charlie 's presence in those fiery eyes . /Hi , pardner , / murmured the cowboy , in obvious recognition . /I thought you might find your way to me .

He was falling into darkness , and coruscating fire .. . And voices began murmuring somewhere close to the center of his mind . . . babbling with information and greetings from one quarx to another ... . /// You okay ? /// /Huh ? / He blinked in the cool twilight of the normal datastream , viewed from a height . He was n't quite sure what had happened , or how he had gotten here from where he 'd just been . /// We got it . /// He blinked again . /Got what ? /  | /// I guess you really blacked out there . He left me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd managed the uplink. /// /Are you serious ? / /// Why would n't I be ? Do you have any objections if I prepare to make the uplink ? /// /I guess not. / Charlie-One had n't even bothered to ask . Bandicut squinted at the fuzzy topography of the datanet . He was still trying to get things back into focus ; he could n't quite figure out where he was . /// Let me just check a few things here . /// The view went black ; then he saw orbital projections , and images of spacecraft  --  moving in orbit , moored at the space station , and waiting on the surface of the dim , icy moon . ///This is Triton , is n't it ? /// /Yah , sure . There 's Neptune in the background in that one . Most of these look like monitor images from the Triton orbital station , where the interplanetary shuttles come in. / /// Orbital station ? What all do they have there ? Just big interplanetary shuttles ? /// /Well , they have a number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones. / /// Hm . I see . /// Bandicut felt drawn to the images . Space  --  that was where he was supposed to be . He wondered if the quarx could make it possible for him to return someday . Now there were some images of the mining encampment , viewed from orbit with a telescopic lens . There were scars visible on the surface from the mining operations ; but on the whole , from space , the human presence looked pretty puny and insignificant . /Does this stuff mean anything in particular to you ? /  | /// For the future perhaps . Right now , I 'm just filling gaps in my knowledge . /// He did n't answer ; while the quarx was scanning datastructures , he was enjoying the chance to see Triton from space . Cooped up in these pressurized cans on the surface , it was easy to forget the big picture . One of the images coming in now was from a monitor in polar orbit around Triton . The ice caps gleamed pinkish white in the augmented light of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to try , /// Charlie said , cutting off the images . /What 'd you do that for ? / /// We can go back to it later . /// A loud buzzing static filled the dataspace . The quarx seemed to be monitoring some sort of communication channel . Or maybe not just monitoring . He seemed to be switching , encoding , and diverting entire streams of data . /Charlie , / Bandicut asked nervously , /are you sure you know what you 're doing ? / /// Well , not altogether . But this seems to be working . I think ... there we go ! /// Something flickered deep in his mind , and before he could blink or gasp or do anything to stop it , he felt a sudden eruption of data , bubbling up out of his mind like a great geyser of sparkling vapor , streaming into the ether . He reeled , and caught a breathless glimpse of where it was going . It was shooting in a shimmering stream up to Triton Orbital , riding encoded on one of the regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning and flashing back clown to Triton on another beam  --  deflected , ever so slightly , toward a silent alien receiver hidden in a deep subsurface cavern . It was working , he realized dizzily . All that information from the ephemeris was streaming to the translator . But it  | was doing more than that . He heard , dimly , the jangling of alarms somewhere in the local datanet. /Charlie , / he muttered over the hiss of data , /are you setting off those alarms ? / ///Alarms ... /Yes , alarms . If you ca n't shut them off , you 'd better stop what you 're doing , fast  --  and get us out of here , before they trace it to our connection . They are not going to be happy if they find us ? / The alarms cut off abruptly . But instead of relief from the quarx , he sensed great worry . Along with the alarms , the streams of data had cut off . Not just the data from Ban-dicut 's mind , but all the data . /// @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you did n't . . . just bring the system down , did you ? / ///Urn-let 's get out of here  --  okay , John ? I 'm not sure what I did . . . /// Much of the local datanet seemed to have gone dark . Bandicut felt tempted to investigate , to see what the quarx had done , to see if there was any way to undo the damage . But he dared not . Instead , he squeezed his eyes shut and willed the connection between him and datanet to part . ? **12;294;mode The sparks in his vision darkened , and he slid the headset from his temples , rubbing his eyes . /Charlie ? / He remembered , suddenly , that Charlie-One had n't intended to send the data that way ; he 'd meant to wait until they could go in person .  | /// I 've  --  caused problems , have n't I ? /// /Yeah. / Bandicut got up , wincing from pain in his bad leg . He opened the door to the booth and peered out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's down , people ! Anybody who 's got an automatic linkage , get to your terminals for damage control  --  right now ! " A loud murmur rose , and half the people in the lounge ran out of the room . Bandicut watched them go , clicking his teeth nervously . /Charlie ? / /// I could n't have .. . caused permanent damage , could I ? /// /Let 's hope not . Let 's just mokin ' hope not. / Bandicut hobbled over toward the refreshment bar . /And I do n't care what damn pills I 'm on , I 'm having a mokin ' beer right now ! /  | As HE SIPPED his glass of the watery stuff that passed for beer here on Triton , he shifted unconsciously into observer mode , guiltily watching those who remained in the rec lounge . There were n't many , to his relief . He felt a profound desire not to interact with anyone . He was angry with Charlie , and angry with himself , for what they had done to the datanet . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . The first half of the first beer went quickly , before he slowed down , remembering the painkillers he was on . His gaze wandered to the far corner of the EineySteiney area , where two women were playing . He blinked , realizing with a start that the two women were Georgia Patwell and her friend , Julie Stone . How had he not noticed them before ? /// You 've been . . . distracted , /// croaked the quarx , who seemed more than a little distracted himself . /I guess so. / In truth , this was n't exactly a time when he wanted to see anyone he knew  --  though as he watched them play , he found his isolationist resolve softening ever so slightly . Still , there was a weightiness surrounding his thoughts . Oddly , he found himself more interested in the women 's EineySteiney shots than in the women them-  | selves . The table-holo was programmed with some fairly sophisticated gravity-well combinations , and the two women were making slingshot banks through the maze of curves and valleys . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balls winked with faces that Bandicut could n't quite make out ; probably it was the cartoon-character program . It was strange enough , his choosing to ogle trajectories instead of women  --  but odder still was the fact that he found himself not only following the motions of the balls , but visualizing practically impossible trajectories for them , with an extraordinarily sharp inner eye . Suddenly he realized what was going on , and it did n't make him happy . He turned away and drained his glass and walked around the bar for a refill . /Charlie , quit mokin ' with my brain ! If I want to look at women , I 'm going to look at women ! You have any idea how long it 's been since I was with a woman ? / He returned to his barstool and continued watching . Georgia made a nearly impossible three-body shot , and he found suddenly that he did n't care so much about the shot . /// Sorry . I guess I got carried away . What they 're doing is very . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a little , and he found a new appreciation of Georgia 's graceful movements around the table . She was married , of course , so it was just harmless appreciation ; but Julie was n't married , and Julie moved with a quickness and intensity that he found even more appealing . He watched as she lined up a shot  --  and missed spectacularly , sending the ball on a loop off the far end of the table , where it vanished in midair with a great burst of stars . Julie laughed good-naturedly . It should have been an easy shot . He liked her laugh .  | He cleared his throat , suddenly self-conscious . /You do n't have to go to the other extreme , / he muttered . IT can generate my own interest without your doing anything . Okay ? / /// I was n't doing anything . /// /Oh. / He took a sip from his glass and studiously looked elsewhere around the lounge , so as not to be caught star-ing . When next he looked back at the EineySteiney table , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said something to Julie . Julie grinned and looked the other way when she saw that Bandicut was watching . Georgia moved toward the bar , waving her cue-wand at him . What was she going to do ? he wondered dimly . Whack him with it ? He felt a brief flurry of lust , and then embarrassment . Down , boy . Julie was following Georgia now , and he felt different-colored sparkles of lust . Now ? he thought , remembering what had brought him here to drink in the first place . " Hey , Bandie  --  I have to leave , " Georgia said , offering him the wand . " Want to step in for me ? Julie 's a good player . " Bandicut swallowed , eyes darting from Georgia to Julie and back again . Say something , idiot . ///Are n't you going to say anything ? /// He cleared his throat . " Uh  --  yeah ! I saw ! Looked good out there ! " Julie rolled her eyes as she stopped her low-gravity lope to stand at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot was n't my best . " Bandicut blushed . He had n't been thinking about that last flub , at all . He 'd been thinking of how she looked . He felt like an imbecile who could n't talk to women without tangling up his words . He forced himself to try to relax , and was aware at once of the dopey smile he probably had on  | his face . " Oh , I did n't mean  --  I mean , yeah , that last one was ? " " I know . " Julie grinned . " But I seem to remember you popping off a couple like that the other night . " " Yeah , " he admitted . Georgia laughed and handed him the wand . " So are you going to play with my friend here or not ? I told her you were good company , Bandie . " " Right , right ! " Bandicut slid off the barstool , accepting the wand . " Okay , you 're off the hook , Georgia . You can get lost now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he added hastily . " Let 's go , " Julie said , as she loped back to the table . /// This I want to watch , /// Charlie muttered . /You can get lost , too , / he said cheerfully as he stumped after Julie . " You break . " Julie nodded and split the starting formation with a crack , sinking a dwarf and a mermaid . Bandicut watched admiringly as she sank three more faces in a row . She missed and it was his shot . Sighting down the cue wand at the Cheshire Cat , he found himself focusing beyond the grinning teeth on the ball to Julie 's intense gaze , watching from the far side of the table . She smiled and moved out of his sight line . The cue was wobbling in his grip . He drew a breath . /Help me out a little , okay ? / /// I thought you wanted ? /// /I just mean , help me steady the shot , all right ? / /// No problem . /// He suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gravity path that he was about to try . The wand flashed at the cue ball , and it spun away , looped around a well , and clacked into the Cheshire Cat . The silver cue ball  | drifted slowly away from the impact , and the Cat 's grin skidded and vanished into the side well . /Great ! / he thought . /// It 's good practice , /// the quarx acknowledged . " Nice shot ! " Julie cheered . " Can you do it again ? How about putting Dinky Duck down the table into the end well ? " He squinted along the path between the cue ball and the diminutive yellow duck . There were two gravity wells in the way of the shot she 'd suggested . He 'd have to slingshot the cue around both of them , just like a spacecraft picking up a gravity-assist from a planet . /// We can do it , /// Charlie assured him . /I 'm trusting you. / He cleared his throat and grinned at Julie . " If I make it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " She allowed a smile on one corner of her mouth . " Only if you make it and promise to stay a nice guy ... " Apparently he managed to retain his vestiges of niceness , because her smile remained as the game continued . He began to lose track of the time , what with one part of his mind lost to a great , flowing tide of hormones , a fresh surge coming every time her lips cracked a smile ; and the other part of him entranced by the joy of firing cartoon-faced balls into long , wholly improbable trajectories . He heard himself suggesting , at the end of their third game , that perhaps they ought to let someone else use the table for a while , and retire to a more comfortable spot for that drink . She agreed , with an almost bashful smile . " What do you guys really do , down there in exoarch ? " he asked , once they were settled in a booth with a semi-privacy-curtain drawn  --  enough to feel cozy , but not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the headrest and half-closed  | her eyes . Her short hair drifted back from her face . She had , he realized , a very small nose , and a pretty neck . Her blue eyes were intense , even half closed . " Oh , you know ? mostly we wait for you guys to bring us something excit-ing , " she said . " Us guys ? " She opened her eyes . " Well , I do n't know if it 's the surveyors or the miners who are more likely to find something bigger than a melted lump of metal  --  but if any of you ever do , that 's when we can really get to work . In the meantime , it 's mainly geology for us . And frankly , I 'm getting pretty sick of geology . " She grinned brightly . " So how about fording us something intact , okay ? How about the head of an alien  --  or at least some nice alien artifacts ? " Bandicut swallowed , his heart almost stopping . A moment ago , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking . Charlie was ominously silent in his brain . " Well ? " he croaked . " I guess  --  we 'd all like to ford something . . . exciting . . . would n't we ? " /// Careful ? /// Julie gazed at him as though she heard more in his words than he 'd intended to convey . " I guess we would , " she agreed . She sipped her drink , and a look of curiosity came over her . " So . . . , " she murmured , " what exactly do you pilot types do for excitement , when you 're not on survey missions ? " Was that a suggestive huskiness in her voice ? He realized that he was sweating a little , and he had probably drunk too much beer . He took another sip . " Well , I , uh ? " and his voice caught a little , because now , he thought , he was going to have to explain how it was that he was n't actually flying survey missions anymore , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thought , no , no , she already knows about that , does n't she ? " Well , I , uh  --  tried my hand at mining , " he joked . " And it got me this ? " He pointed to the cast on his left ankle .  | " Ah so , " said Julie . " How 'd that happen , anyway ? " He tried not to wince as he groped for a suitable explanation , preferably one that would n't make him look like a moron . " Well  --  I slipped on some ice , and this ankle was the only thing between me and a big laser beam . So the ankle lost . " " Did you really try to pull a robot out of a mining tun-nel ? " Julie blurted , and then immediately looked sorry for broaching the subject . He groaned inwardly . Did everyone know about it already ? " Well , yeah , " he admitted sheepishly . " It was pretty dumb . I do n't . . . know what came over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . /// Good , good . . . /// Julie kept a straight face , but it obviously took some effort . " I guess . . . it must have been pretty embarrassing . " He nodded and shifted his eyes away , feeling self-conscious all over again . When he looked back , he saw that she was studying him with quizzical interest . " Well ? ? " he murmured , turning his palms up . Julie 's face cracked in a grin . " You know something ? You 're not like the rest of those pilot types ! You 're . . . dif-ferent . " " Is that good ? " he asked uncertainly . She nodded , and an odd look came over her face . She took a long pull on her drink and seemed to be trying to decide something . The grin started to return , as she shifted her eyes one way and then another , as though looking to see if anyone was watching . Then she leaned forward , biting her lip . " Georgia tells me she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He blinked , startled . Her face immediately darkened with embarrassment . " Oh , God , I ca n't believe I said that ! " She averted her gaze with a groan , then hesitantly sidled a glance back at him . She giggled and peered down into her half-empty glass . " I  | must not be holding my alcohol very well , " she said ruefully . " Please excuse me . " His mind was awash with libidinous possibilities . When he answered , his voice was n't working too well , and it came out more or less as a croak . " And how would Georgia know ? Who 's she been talking to , anyway ? " And are you anywhere near as horny as I am ? Do you know how long it 's been ? He grinned , helplessly aware of what a perfect goal ( he probably looked like . " Who should she be talking to ? " Julie asked shyly , blinking at him over her cocktail glass . Nobody on Triton , that 's for sure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words . Kiss her , you idiot . What do you think she 's asking for ? He cleared his throat and carefully moved his mug of beer out of the way . /// You are n't thinking of .. . you are n't planning to ? /// /Shut up . This would be an excellent time for you to shut up. / /// But I ? you ? /// /SHUT UP ! / His smile was turning weird-looking . He could feel it , but he could n't stop it . Julie cocked her head , those intense eyes gazing at him with thoughts that he could only wonder at . " John , what is it ? Is your leg hurting ? ? " Yes yes yes , that 's it ... " Urn , a little , I guess . " He forced what he hoped was a warmer expression onto his face . What he was actually conveying , he could n't imagine . She smiled , and his heart thumped . " I guess , um , if that 's her ... theory . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's nothing like firsthand ? " She leaned across the little table and stopped his words with a kiss , hesitant at first , then more confident . Time shuddered to a halt . His heart nearly stopped from the pressure of her lips . She pulled back , smiled  --  and he leaned farther to kiss her again . She returned willingly , lips  | firm for a moment , then softening . He rose up in his seat , as if weightless . His breath struggled to find release in the back of his throat , and he felt her sighing with nervous pleasure .. . ///John John , please ? /// A year of pent-up loneliness welled up in him , making him want to cry out . He raised a trembling hand to touch her hair , ever so gently . /// Please do n't do this , John ! /// She seemed to like that ; she kissed harder , and he felt her tongue dart out and touch his lips .. . /// STOP IT ! /// A sheet of white static flashed across his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a jerk . /What the mokin ' hell ? ? / /// Please  --  I ca n't stand this ! /// He blinked helplessly at Julie , trying not to turn red with humiliation . /Ca n't stand WHAT ? / /// This ? /// " What 's wr ? ? John ? Is something wrong ? " Julie was staring at him , flustered and wide-eyed . She sat back abruptly , wrapping her fingers around her cocktail glass . " Was I  --  I mean  --  hey , I hope I was n't too forward ! " " No , no ! " He struggled to think of an explanation , an apology . " Oh , well  --  did I kick your leg or something ? I 'm sorry , I did n't even think ? " Desperate for something to say , he gulped , " No , no , but ! ? I just  --  wrenched it a little . " Feeling his face burn , he struggled to recover his dignity with the lie . " I 'm  --  uh-sorry , " he croaked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raged . /What do you think you 're doing , you meddling little ? ? / /// I 'm sorry ! /// Charlie screeched . /// I apologize ! But I could n't let you ? ///  | /WHAT ? ENJOY MYSELF ? / Bandicut roared . He shook , grimacing  --  and immediately realized that he had just made an audible , rattling sound of anguish . He struggled to put a normal expression back on his face . " John , are you in pain ? " Julie asked worriedly . /// No , I  --  I ? I ? /// the quarx choked , radiating waves of consternation. /You you you what ? Why do n't you just shut up ? / Ile made a prolonged clearing-of-the-throat sound , focusing his eyes on Julie with an effort . " I  --  ah  --  no , no , I 'm fine ? " She peered at him for a moment , then lifted her glass and took a long drink , rattling the ice cubes . Her blue eyes appeared dark and beautiful , and utterly unreadable . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she sighed , " if your leg is giving you trouble , the last thing you need is to have me coming on to you . " " No , really , you were n't ? " he wheezed . " It was fine ! " He swallowed . " It was . . . uh , pretty nice , actually . " A smile cracked through her unreadable expression . " Yeah , it was pretty nice , was n't it ? " She laughed ner-vously . He nodded , momentarily incapable of speech . /// It 's just that I could n't risk your telling her .. . or getting too distracted , /// the quarx whispered desperately . " Yes ? " he croaked to Julie . /// There 's just too much at stake . /// He flushed with anger . /The only thing at stake right now is whether I 'm going to get more than a wink and a handshake for the first time in two years , dickhead. / /// Huh ? Well , I know , but I just could n't I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ragged breath and finally managed p 213 to return Julie 's smile . " I guess I . . . did n't quite live up to Georgia 's ... prediction , did I ? You think I should go back liar more training ? " Julie chuckled self-consciously . " Well , Georgia never actually said she was making a personal report . Anyway , for a warmup , it was n't too bad . But yeah , I 'd say the jury needs to hear more evidence . " She blushed . " So look , do you need some help getting back to your dorm room , or what ? Or is this where I exit graciously , and , you know , let you make your moves elsewhere ? " " Elsewhere ? " he said , with feigned bewilderment . He peered around as though to scan the entire lounge , then sat hack again , trying to keep his grin . Oh , real smart ! Why not just say she 's the only game in sight , or else you 'd hustle right up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , John ? /// Julie laughed , but whether it was because of , or in spite of , his idiocy he could n't tell . " Ri-i-ight , " she said . " Well , look , methinks I 'd better get some sleep anyway . Dawn comes mighty early in this town . " She started to slide out of the booth . He rose up from his seat in quiet desperation . " Wait ! Let me at least walk you  --  er , limp you  --  home . " " Well ? " He held out a hand in invitation . /// But there 's so much we have to do ! /// /Speak for yourself. / He gazed at her imploringly . " Please ? " Julie 's eyes sparkled again the way they had earlier . " Compromise . You may walk me to the end of my corridor . And you may have one discreet good-night kiss . " She raised a warning finger . " One only . So as not to injure your leg further . " He lifted a fist in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm . " Score , nothing ! I am not a fast  | mover , I warn you . " She slid out of the booth and extended a hand to help him stand . True to her word , she permitted him one brief kiss at a bulkhead door near her room , then turned away with a whispered , " Good night . " Before the door could close between them , she leaned back , causing the door to spasm in the middle of its cycle . " Will you be there tomorrow evening ? " He nodded , without even thinking about whether it would be true ; he decided then and there that it would be . A moment later , Julie had fled down the corridor to the women 's dorm , and he was standing facing a closed bulkhead door . /// I thought we were operating with an understanding , /// Charlie sputtered  --  accusingly , he thought . He snorted as he turned toward his own dorm section . /What understanding ? / /// That the mission was paramount , that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitterly . /Give me a call when you 're ready to start the mission , all right ? In the meantime , butt out of my love life. / Charlie 's sputtering faded to silence . He returned to the dorm room and found Gordon Kracking getting ready for bed . " Bandie  --  are you okay ? " Krackey cried when Bandicut walked in . Before Bandicut could answer , a crack opened in one of the bunk curtains , and Mick Eddison stuck his head out , peering at the two . He did n't say anything ; he just guffawed , then ducked back into his bunk and snapped the curtain shut again . Bandicut glared silently , before turning to his friend . " Yeah , Krackey , I 'm okay . You guys make out all right without me ? " Krackey ran his fingers through his wildly unkempt p 215 fair . " Yeah , yeah , sure . What a day , though , huh ? First that happens to you  --  how 's the ankle , by the way  --  do you still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " ? and then I no sooner get back in than the whole fr ' deekin ' datanet crashes and I have to go help them try to put it back together ! Man , I do n't know what went wrong with that  --  hey , you have n't been drinking on painkillers , have you ? ? " Bandicut realized he was swaying a little . He shook his head . " ? but I 've been telling them all along that it 's a fr'deekin ' house of cards , and sooner or later something was gon na happen . " " Uh-huh . " Krackey was shaking his head , putting some clothes away in a drawer . " Yeah , all the safeguards failed at once , and a lot of stuff that was n't too well protected got trashed when the thing came down . " Bandicut focused on emptiness and tried to draw a breath . Krackey looked up at him , furrowing his brow . " Say , you were n't havin ' one of your damn ? " he caught himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bandicut shook his head absently . He pulled himself up to the upper bunk , swinging his injured ankle in carefully . Krackey shrugged . " So the question , I guess , is whether it was failure or sabotage . " " Sab  --  otage ? " Bandicut croaked , leaning back out . " The datanet crash . That 's what they 're sayin ' , any-way  --  maybe some disgruntled employee . Probably just a crazy rumor . It 's hard to figure why anyone would want to sabotage the datanet  --  unless maybe the environmental nuts from exoarch , tryin ' to slow things down . But naw , even they need the net . How else they gon na get their info in and out ? "  | Who would want to sabotage the datanet ? Bandicut thought . . . unless maybe some alien who wanted to control what was happening on this moon . Some alien who had won the trust of a human accomplice . /// That 's not it , not at all . /// " If it was sabotage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Krackey went on . " You ca n't get away with something like that for long , not in a place like this . Especially not after knocking out traffic control and causing a nearcollision up at the space station . " He shook his head . " But hey , you 're sick . Never mind all that stuff , just get some sleep , okay ? " " Okay . " Bandicut pulled his curtain shut and fell back with a wordless groan , eyes closed . He breathed deeply and rapidly for a moment . /I hope you 're ready to talk. / /// You do n't really think ? /// /I do n't know what I think . I just know that you blew down the whole damn datanet , and you nearly caused a crash , which you had n't bothered to mention to me ? / /// I did n't know ! /// /You did n't , huh ? I do n't really think someone as smart as you does something like that by accident. / /// I  --  no ! You 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Honestly ! /// /No ? I figure , if you 're smart enough to tie into the net like that , you ought to be smart enough to keep from screwing everything up in the process. / /// No  --  I mean , it 's not that I 'm so smart .  | Really . There 's a lot I do n't understand . Yes , I had the ability to make the connection , but it does n't mean I can predict everything that 's going to happen in your datanet . Please believe me ! /// Bandicut lay silent , thinking . Believe the quarx ? Why should he ?

You better start trusting me enough to tell me the truth , damn you. / Several seconds passed before Charlie spoke again . Bandicut felt a wave of shadow pass across his visual field . He steeled himself for confrontation . /// It 's not what you think , /// Charlie said at last , in a voice tinged with an emotion that Bandicut did not at once recognize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The emotion rolled over him like an ocean swell . He  | was suddenly aware of fragmented bits of memory of other living beings , races that the quarx had touched at some point in its various lives ... nothing visual , nothing that would help him recognize the beings in a dark alley . . . but visceral impressions of carnality , of organic ferment , the rich scents of sexuality , of decay , of unclean material life . He struggled to follow . /// This must shock you . /// /What ? / he whispered . ///Just that ? /// The quarx hesitated , as though trying to let go of something bottled up inside .

Yes . I 'm sorry , John . /// /I 'm sorry ! / Bandicut mimicked savagely . He drew a cp breath , and then another . /What the hell gives you the ht to dictate what I do or do n't do ? / he exploded , shak-g with rage . /// Well , I ? just could n't help it . /// /I did n't invite you to take up residence here , you know ! ca n't believe this !

I hope ... you 're not angry , are you ? /// He began laughing bitterly , and laughed until his eyes were full of tears . Then he abruptly fell silent , flat on his back in his bunk . /Get out of my brain , / he whispered . /Just get out of my brain , you miserable , disgusting little creature ... / The quarx seemed to retreat into a tight ball in his mind . Bandicut tossed and turned , trying to forget the whole thing and go to sleep . It was impossible . Though he 'd never been married , he wondered if this was what it was like to try to sleep with a partner with whom you were furious . The gloom of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He sighed bitterly , wondering whether to say something to the quarx . Not that he was n't still angry ; but they were , after all , stuck with each other . He supposed he was going to have to make the best of it . But what was there to say ? After a time , he found his thoughts blurring . He thought , at one point , that he sensed a tiny tendril of presence reach out and touch something in his mind . Somehow it was a calming touch , and a few moments later , his thoughts quieted like a fading storm , and he drifted to sleep . He dreamed of balls , EineySteiney balls . He dreamed of balls colliding and rebounding , tracing strange and impossible trajectories around a vast pool table , spinning past gravity wells and sliding , floating , never quite coming to rest . He felt that there was some strange and wonderful order in the way that they moved , some chaotic pattern that was not order as he knew it , but another kind of order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spinning in strange and impossible trajectories , in a chaotic dance p 221 of the spheres that only the most perceptive could thorn .. . He dreamed of fire , consuming fire , the fire of a thousand suns .. .  | HE WOKE GRADUALLY , with fantastic imagery passing before his eyes : moving fractals and spinning chaotic attractors . He knew what the images were , though he did n't understand them . Some of them looked like exotic alien landscapes , and some like exploding crystals ; he knew that they were neither , but rather mathematical representations . After a while , the images changed to color impressions that held no meaning for him whatever . He sensed that these were something from the quarx 's personal experience . ///Are you awake ? /// the quarx asked tentatively . He blinked his eyes open . For a moment , the images hung like transparent holograms in front of him ; then they faded , and he was left with his own vision . /Yah  --  I 'm awake. / /// Are you still ... mad ? /// @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ du n no . Are you making a peace offering ? / /// I guess . . . you could say that . /// He thought of Julie . /// I really am sorry , you know . /// i p 223 /Sorry enough to stay out of my way the next time I meet up with Julie ? / ///I 'll by . Very hard . I 'm not sure . . . I can promise to succeed . /// /Mmm. / Bandicut decided that that was probably the st he could hope for . He sat up , banging his head on the nk overhead . " OW ! Damn it ! " /// Would you like me to stop you when I see you getting ready to do that ? /// /I would appreciate that very much. / Bandicut sighed , inking that as long as he and the quarx were together , en he was going to have to make the best of it . Charlie cleared his throat . ///About the mission . . . /// /Yes ? Are we going to get moving on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the translator , to find out exactly what we have to do . And the sooner the better . /// Bandicut grunted . /I ca n't control that. / ///I know . I do n't think any of us anticipated the difficulty we would have in returning . But until we do , we ca n't pinpoint the danger that we have to stop . /// Bandicut rubbed his eyebrows wearily . /So maybe it 's time we told somebody about the danger . Then they could look for it , and take care of it , and we could quit worrying. / /// I 'm afraid that 's not a viable option . The social turbulence factors are too great , the time is too short . And I know Charlie-One did n't trust your superiors . /// /Yeah , well ... / Bandicut could n't argue with that . /Did he tell you all this in that little meeting we had ? /  | ///A lot of it . And he helped me put together some pieces that I already had . But the important question is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least not yet . /// Bandicut pulled the privacy-curtain open and slid out of his bunk . His ankle ached fiercely . /All right  --  yes  --  you win. / /// You 're still mad , are n't you ? /// the quarx asked softly . /Yeah. / He stumped toward the lay . The dorm was deserted . He realized that he had slept past the start of the workday , and then he realized that it did n't matter , because he was on the injured list . /I 'll get over it . So what do you suggest , if we ca n't tell anyone ? / /// If you have nothing else to do . . . /// /You already know I don't. / /// Then may we do some library research ? /// /In the datanet ? / Bandicut blanched , thinking of the havoc the quarx had wreaked last night . ///If it 's up , yes . But I promise  --  no more meddling . /// /All right . After we eat. / Bandicut dressed quickly . /But if you 're lying about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na cut your balls off. / /// Uh ... okay ... /// As it turned out , a portion of the datanet was back up , though not the connection to the inner solar system . Bandicut saw nothing to suggest that any connection had been made between the net crash and his own presence , which was a considerable relief . And Charlie was presently only interested in the general history files , which were easily available in the local library .  | The quarx spun through chapter after chapter of human history , while Bandicut , feeling a bit like a kid tagging along after a more knowledgeable older kid , glanced at some of the more interesting bits as Charlie scanned . From time to time , Charlie asked him for further illumination on historical questions , and almost invariably , he had to plead ignorance . History had never been a great interest of his . /// But you know that your history is full of violence among your own kind , do n't you ? /// /Of course . So what ? / Bandicut answered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world wars , then jumped back to the Roman and Greek wars , then ahead to the crucifixion of Christ , then forward again to the Inquisitions and the Crusades. /What are you looking for exactly ? / /// Information ... understanding .

What do you want to look at now ? / The quarx hesitated . /// Well , I hope this does n't upset you , but .. . I need to know about your planetary defenses. /// Bandicut nearly jerked them out of the neurolink. /Hey ! / ///Moke , I knew it would upset you . John , I 'm not planning an invasion . I mean your defenses against natural disasters . ///  | /Oh. / Bandicut glared suspiciously for a moment , then reflected that anything on the public boards was probably not very critical in terms of security , anyway . He unclenched , and they dived together into a new area of the library files . /// This is unbelievable , /// Charlie said after studying the civil and planetary defense systems around Earth . /What 's unbelievable ? / /// Your complacency ! You settle on floodplains , on earthquake faults , on mud cliffs ; you leave your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !

You have no defense ! /// /Well ? / Bandicut swallowed , trying to think of a way to argue , but there was none . /There were some defense systems for a while  --  but I guess they were too expensive to maintain. /  | /// Expensive ? How much is your civilization worth ? /// /I do n't know . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charlie brushed aside the protest . ///Do you know what killed off the dinosaurs ? /// Of course he knew .

And you trusted him  --  more than you trust me. /// /I ? / The quarx chuckled with surprising ease . /// That 's all right . We both know it . /// Charlie was silent for a moment , then said softly , /// I fear that time is growing short . ///  | Bandicut suddenly shivered with fear . /Then should n't we  --  I mean  --  what about the translator ? / /// The translator is aware of the time , /// ( : harlie said reassuringly . ///It would find some way to let us know , rather than let the Earth be hit ...

He glanced around , and saw no sign of her , which was perhaps just as well , considering his mood . Georgia Patwell was playing EineySteiney with her husband and several other friends . He opted to remain by the bar , sipping a beer and resting his aching ankle . It occurred to him that he had n't checked in with Cole Jackson today , either in person or on the system board , but by then he was into his second beer , and after thinking about it , he just shook his head and said screw it . So what if it cost him a demerit or two ? What was the good  | of being on the disabled list if you had to check with the boss every time you turned around ? During a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar to say hi . " I hear you and Julie hit it off pretty well last night , " she said , with a gleam in her eye . " Uh  --  yeah , until I turned into a cripple here with my ankle , " he said , indicating his fastract cast to try to hide his blush . " You 'll be out of that soon , wo n't you ? We miss you in ops . " Georgia chuckled . " Especially Lonnie . " " Oh yeah , I 'll bet . Lonnie must be dying for me to come back . " " Well , he has n't had anyone to abuse lately . " Georgia glanced back at the pool table where her husband was waiting . " Anyway , I hear you 're getting your rover back , as soon as you 're off the hit list . " " Really ? No one 's told me about it . " " Well , I 'd check with Cole , if I were you . " Georgia picked up her refilled glass . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you she ca n't be here tonight  --  in case you were waiting for her . She said she left you a message , but was n't sure if you 'd get it before you came . " " Oh , uh  --  thanks . " He blushed again . " Do n't mention it . She was going to come , but it turned out she had to work overtime to reconstruct some files that went ffft-t-t when the net crashed . She 'll probably be here tomorrow , though . " Bandicut bobbed his head . Georgia looked at him slyly . " I think she likes you . Anyway , catch you later . Come join us , if you want . " With a wave , Georgia wandered back to the pool table . Bandicut continued to bob his head for a moment , then took a swallow of beer and turned back to the bar , moving his left foot carefully . /// I had nothing to do with Julie not coming . I hope you realize that . ///  | He rolled his eyes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you check and see if it 's true . /// /What , whether Julie 's working overtime ? / /// No  --  about you getting your rover back . /// /Oh. / He shrugged . /Yeah , I suppose that 's a good idea. / l lc took another swallow . /// Instead of sitting here making yourself miserable , I mean . /// /Stop making sense , will you ? / Hoisting his glass , he drained his beer . /All right  --  you appear to have a one-day reprieve . I hope you 're getting ready for it. / /// Beg pardon ? /// /One day . And then I will have my crude , tawdry animal fling . Comprende ? / /// Oh . Uh ? /// /What ? / /// Do you really intend to . . . have sex ? Just like that ? I thought it took more , I do n't know , buildup . . . /// /Aw , shut up about the facts and just let me keep my fantasies , will you ? / Bandicut got up and walked from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner of his mind . Checking the system board from a comm booth , he found two messages from Cole Jackson , asking him to check in ; one message from Julie , saying exactly what Georgia had just told him ; and the job assignments for survey section for the next few days . Sure enough , he was back on the ros-ter  --  for northeast recon , starting the day after tomorrow . That was n't exactly going to give him much time to heal . But he was out of the mines . And , though it did n't say so , he had presumably been exonerated by the inquiry . Studying the assignment more closely , he noted that it covered a fair amount of territory that he had already  | mapped . You do n't suppose , he thought , that all that recon data was kept unanalyzed , and unbacked-up , and evaporated when .. . He did n't bother to complete the thought . He just shook his head , and felt the quarx flinch. /Guilty , guilty , guilty , / he whispered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock . First thing in the morning , he went to Jackson 's office . Cole was n't in yet , so on an impulse , he sat down at a terminal and tried to pull up his job performance report . The system honked and refused to admit him . He sat for a moment , thinking . " Bandicut ! Where the hell have you been ? " Cole Jackson strode into the office , carrying a large steaming cup of coffee . It reminded him that he had n't eaten yet . " I got . . . your message , " he stammered , then added , " Since Switzer put me on the disabled list , I 've been taking it easy , trying to rest . " " Yeah , okay , " Jackson said , walking around to his desk . " There was no need to come in person . You are n't going to get that ankle healed by doing a lot of unnecessary walking , you know . " Bandicut nodded . " I see you 've put me back on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  if you do n't mind my asking ? " " I do n't mind . Why should I ? " Jackson rocked back in his chair , sipping his coffee . " They gave you credit for the field repair , just like I said they should . " Oh , Bandicut thought . Jackson added , " My people know how to do their jobs . I 've always said that . So what you did was something neither more nor less than expected . " Bandicut allowed a half-smile to cross his lips . Cole , if you knew . . . if you only knew .. .  | " So , " Jackson said , eyeing Bandicut expectantly . " Are you going to be in shape tomorrow ? " Bandicut suppressed a chuckle . " I doubt that Switzer will okay it so soon after the accident . He said five days . You know how these company quacks are  --  sticklers for medical detail  --  they like people to be at least half recovered before they put them back on the job . " Jackson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care of the recovery , and let me handle Switzer , okay ? Are you well enough to come in and do some desk work ? " Bandicut shrugged . " I guess so , as long as I do n't overdo it . " He hesitated . " I notice we 're redoing some of the original survey . " That brought a scowl from Jackson . " Why the hell you think we 're in such a hurry ? Maybe now they 'll start listening to me when I tell them the damn datanet is vulnerable to sabotage . I 've been saying that all along . " Bandicut kept a poker face . " Sabotage ? You think someone . . . sabotaged . . . the system ? " Jackson 's face darkened further . " Why ? Do you know something about it ? " Bandicut shook his head , not trusting his voice . He felt his face going blank . /// What are you doing ? Are you trying to draw suspicion to yourself ? /// " No , " he managed finally . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been on the sick list . " /Of course not . I just ? / Jackson glared . " Bandicut , why are you looking like that ? " He flushed . " Nothing . Just  --  the painkillers , I guess . I suppose I should go lie down or something . " " That 's what I just told you . Anyway , go see Switzer and let me know what he says . We need you out there . Now , get some rest , will you ? " Bandicut rose and limped carefully from the room .  | DR . SWITZER SHOOK his head , chuckling . " Your boss called and said he wants you back at work tomorrow . I told him that was ridiculous . What does he think this is , anyway ? I could n't possibly approve sending you out in less than three days after a broken ankle . Now , if you 'd taken the nanomed treatment like I told you ? " Bandicut started to answer , but the doctor had already turned away to consult his computer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " you might have done the right thing , refusing that particular course of treatment . We discovered another batch with faulty programming just yesterday . Instead of bringing a fever down , it gave some poor guy chickenpox . " He barked a short , harsh laugh . " I do n't know why they ca n't quality-control the stuff better than that . Here , now , let 's have a look . " Bandicut watched , none too confidently , as the doctor hoisted his ankle and jacked a monitor into the fastract cast . " You been taking those pills I gave you ? " Switzer asked . " I think I forgot once . " Actually , he 'd forgotten more often than he 'd remembered . Switzer grunted , snapping a few switches . " Well , then , do n't blame me . " He glanced at Bandicut with a chuckle . p 235 " Here we go . " His eyebrows contracted as he studied the machine . " You 're not doing too badly here . According to this , your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bandicut nodded . " I guess Cole is going to have to be disappointed . " Switzer scratched the back of his head . " Well , now  --  he did make it sound pretty urgent , did n't he ? " " Not that urgent , I 'm sure . " Switzer seemed not to hear him . " I guess maybe we could work something out . As long as you 're just going to be driving . I mean , you wo n't be getting out and stumbling around out on the plain , will you ? " Bandicut stared at him , thinking , that 's probably exactly what I 'll be doing . Switzer chuckled , as though they had just shared a joke . " Look , I 'll tell you what  --  check in with me first thing in the morning , and I 'll see what we can do for you . " " You do n't have to do anything special for me . " Switzer chuckled and clapped Bandicut on the shoulder . " I like to keep my workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come back , has it ? " When Bandicut shook his head , the doctor shrugged . " Okay , I guess we 'll let sleeping dogs lie on that one . Come back tomorrow , and do n't forget to take the rest of those pills . " You do n't like embarrassing mysteries in your office , do you ? Bandicut thought , sliding off the table . He knew he should be glad that Switzer was n't pursuing the question of the fever , but he could n't help wondering what the old quack would say if he knew Bandicut was possessed by  --  or rather , was harboring  --  an alien . /// Thank you for that correction . It 's going to remain an academic question , is n't it ? /// /Does this guy look like someone I would trust to tell about you ? / Bandicut loped off down the corridor , his cast thumping lightly and rhythmically on the deck .  | /// Good point . Where to now ? /// /To find Julie. / /// Oh ... /// /Prepare to hold your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the quarx , which suited him just fine . The lounge was deserted . He thought a moment , then decided to try the exoarch group offices . If this was going to be his last day off , he wanted to make the best of it . Charlie seemed nervous as he made his way down to the lower level . Bandicut had the feeling that the quarx was afraid that but he would blow their cover with the exoarch people , ldwas determined to demonstrate thought flickered across his mindhis quarxian tongue . mind that it would be interesting to see how far the quarx ' s trust could be pushed . He did his best to dismiss the thought . The exoarch department was marked with vav hand-inked nd entered taped to an olive-drab door . He rapped twhen he heard a muffled voice from within . " Well , hi there ! " voice , cabinet to locate her , said the Julie 's . He had to peer around a filing sitting behind a narrow desk , with a computer console to one side . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at work ? " Hard She waggled a hand noncommittally . " Alone , yes . at work , maybe . I 've already gotten everything restored that mattered . It was no big deal  --  I had good backups . But ? " She hesitated , and suddenly looked embarrassed . " What ? " just been toying Julie shrugged , chuckling . " Oh , I 've j with a crazy notion of mine , about the datanet crash . " She glanced at her console monitor . " Oh yeah ? What is it ? " he asked , his heart quickening as p 237 he walked around the cabinet to her side of the room . " Can I peek ? " She thought a moment . " Well  --  there 's nothing to look at , really . But sure , okay . " Julie flipped some pages of text and diagrams back and forth on the screen . " You 'll think I 'm nuts , but what the hell , so will everyone else . I might as well try it out on you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across her desk at the screen . He could n't quite read it from where he stood . " Come on now , it could n't be any crazier than some things I 've come up with . " Her eyes sparkled . " I do n't know about that . You tell me . " She tapped the screen , then swiveled her chair to face him . He sat down in a chair directly across her desk from her . " Okay  --  now this is just an idea , and it 's not even in my area of expertise . I have n't got one shred of real evidence to back it up , okay ? " " Okay . " Suddenly he felt very nervous . ///Are you thinking what I 'm thinking ? /// /Mm. / Julie nodded . " Okay  --  well , then  --  everyone keeps talking about how it could have been sabotage that made the datanet crash . But no one 's found proof , and no one 's been able to explain who would want to sabotage the net . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't have any competitors . " " Well , " he pointed out , " there are some who would like to be competitors , back in-system . There 's the South America group , and the Mars group . MINEXFO 's monopoly does n't last forever . " Julie waved off the objection . " Sure , but I mean , there 's no one else here right now trying to mine the turf . Okay , it 's possible that someone here is a plant from one of those groups , I suppose ? " " I 've heard people say it could be the environment  | lobby , trying to screw up the system . " He tried to say it in a jocular tone , but it came out sounding forced . Julie rolled her eyes . " If I , as an admitted wacko environmentalist , wanted to screw up the system , I sure would n't do it by bringing down my only avenue for getting news and propaganda out , and support in . That makes no sense . And anyway , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " What if you were an incompetent , wacko environmen-talist ? " Her eyes twinkled . " I think we left all of them at home . " " Ah . " He cleared his throat . " So that leaves plain old system malfunction through shoddy design and poor workmanship . Right ? " She shrugged . " Maybe . " Despite his unease , he could n't keep from meeting her eyes . He suddenly , intensely , wanted to kiss her . " Or , " she said softly , her voice a throaty murmur , " it could have been interference from an outside agency . An agency that no one has even considered , despite the fact that we 're all here for the purpose of excavating the remains of an alien technology . Have you ever thought about that ? " He cleared his throat again , more energetically . Steady , boy . Think before you answer . ///John  --  do n't ! /// /I 'm not ? / " No answer ? " she said , with a quizzical smile . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think I 'm thinking , or because you 're deciding that you 've just dropped in on a fruitcake ? " He laughed nervously . " I admit , I had n't thought about it . . . in quite that way . I mean , I suppose it is . . . possible . " He swallowed . " But you said yourself , there 's no evidence , right ? " She rocked forward , resting her elbows on her desk , and gazed thoughtfully at a point just over his shoulder . He p 239 stared at her , at those intense eyes lost in thought , and wondered frantically what he was doing here . She turned back to her screen . " Not real evidence , no . But there is one thing I found in the report ... " She glanced at him . His heart was racing . " It has to do with a deflection in the comm beam from Triton Orbital to the surface . " " Uh ? ? " he croaked . She brushed her hair back from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just before the datanet came down . It was reaimed about seven kilometers to the northeast of us , out beyond navpoint Wendy on the charts . We have no explanation for that . " " Uh  --  part of the datanet failure ? " Julie shrugged . " Could be . But it seems kind of odd to me . Nobody 's been able to explain how that particular thing could have happened . It appears to have been done by a software command , but no one 's been able to trace the source of the command . " /// Thank God for that . /// Bandicut nodded impassively , trying to look curious . " But that does n't mean it could n't yet be traced , " Julie continued . " Of course , it 's just a wild idea . But it seems to me that if you 're investigating alien remains , and weird things start happening , it at least makes sense to consider the possibility ?

Someone who can link right in . He swallowed hard . " I ca n't . . . do that , anymore . I mean , I 've . . . lost my neuro capability . " She looked puzzled . " But I saw the records of people connected to the net at the time it went down , and you were on the list . " His heart skipped . He felt Charlie squirming in fear . " I , well , yes  --  I can connect to a very limited extent . But I  | mean limited , compared to what I used to be able to do . Say ? " his voice caught , and he tried to make it a laugh " ? you do n't suspect me , do you ? " She smiled disarmingly . " Of course not . I suspect aliens , I told you . I 'm just looking for someone who can ... look for evidence , where I ca n't . " He suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished he could take Julie home with him ; he wished he could On a sudden impulse , he glanced quickly around the room , making sure there was no one else here . He hitched his chair close to her desk and leaned forward , biting his lip . " Listen , do you  --  do you want to ? ? " His voice caught , and her eyes blinked , and the corners of her mouth turned up as she leaned toward him . His heart hammered . " Do you want to go get some din  --  do you mind if I kiss you ? " ///John ! You are n't really going to ? /// /Clear out , ether-brain ! / He felt Charlie twitch away , and his heart stopped as he waited for Julie to react . Her eyes widened , but when she moved , it was to lean farther across the desk toward him . She closed her eyes , and he rose to meet her halfway , and their lips touched , brushing lightly . He smiled against her lips ; she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he pressed just a little harder , and her lips met his more urgently . His heart was beating full tilt now , and he felt Charlie squirming and contracting into a ball as his blood grew hot with arousal . " How 's your ankle ? " she whispered , brushing her lips over his cheek and then his temple . " My . . . umm ... fine , " he whispered back , suppressing a little shiver . " It 's the rest of me that ? " " Shhh , " she said , drawing away a little and putting a finger to his lips . " Not here . " She peered into his eyes . " Do you want ? ? " " Dinner ? " he croaked . p 241 She grinned and looked at the clock . " At noon ? How about lunch ? " " Oh ? " " We could take it back to . . . my place . I have a private ? " " Let 's go , " he murmured huskily . They slipped down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whenever anyone else was in sight , and hurrying with suppressed excitement when the way was clear . They darted into the cafeteria and loaded a takeout tray with sandwiches and drinks , and hurried away . He felt suddenly awkward as they crept into her dorm compartment and slid the privacy-curtain closed . Julie seemed to feel it as well , but when she put the tray down on the tiny desktop , and turned , and he put his arms around her in a prolonged hug , the awkwardness did n't seem to matter anymore . She pressed her hands against his chest and whispered , " I know this is crazy . But you made my toes curl , the other night . Will you do that to me again ? Please ? " ///John ? /// There was a note of desperation in the quarx 's voice . He ignored the voice . He struggled to find words . Julie answered the silence by stretching up and kissing him .. . " Julie ? " It was the longest , deepest , throatiest kiss yet , tongues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half-unfastened shirts , bodies lurching in the one-thirteenth gravity . " Julie , are you in there ? " The voice was female , and sounded concerned . " Damn ? ! " Julie whispered . She broke from the kiss and slumped against him , arms holding him limply . For a moment , they were silent and still together . Then Julie raised her head and called out , " Yes ! What is it ? "  | " Can I come in ? It 's Georgia . " Bandicut groaned softly and straightened up . He began to refasten his shirt front , but Julie stayed him with one hand . " What is it ? I 'm ? " Julie gulped " ? not feeling ... too well . I 'm , uh , trying to take a nap . " She looked at Bandicut and grimaced , then hiccuped with suppressed laughter . " I need to talk . It 's about John . It wo n't take long . " About John ? he thought . Georgia rattled the curtain fastener , and it popped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " she croaked in sudden mortification . " I , uh ? " " I thought I locked that thing ! " Julie snarled , hurriedly readjusting her clothing . She looked apologetically at Bandicut , and he shrugged silently . He glanced at Georgia , and caught her hiding a grin . He blushed and averted his eyes . " Sorry ? ! " Georgia murmured , backing out of the door-way . " Oh , hell , you might as well tell me what you wanted , " Julie sighed . She cocked her head . " You said it was about John ? " She glanced at Bandicut . " My John . Not you , Bandie , " Georgia said wryly . " Ah , " said Julie . " I , uh  --  it can wait . I 'll talk to you . . . later . " Coughing politely , Georgia added , " I 'm sorry . . . you 're not feeling well . " She closed the curtain again , but Bandicut thought he heard her chuckle . Julie sighed deeply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and finally turned her eyes up to his . " Well ? how 's that for a mood-breaker ? " He grunted , and managed a grin . " What do you suppose are the , uh . . . chances of . . . getting the mood back ? " Julie pressed her lips together fretfully . " You could ask me to . . . dinner , " she suggested . Bandicut turned his head to peer at the tray of food . " Want to have dinner at a gourmet restaurant ? " he  | squeaked . " Or ? " his voice deepened again " ? do you want to kiss me again ? " She smiled . " It 's not dinner time yet . But I like the second idea , I think . " She leaned back toward him . The comm buzzed once , and they ignored it . It buzzed again , insistently . This time when they broke from their embrace , they were both cursing . Julie snarled and pressed the talk button . " Yes ? " " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right away ? We 've got something from the latest scans that you 've got to see . " Julie furrowed her eyebrows . " What is it ? " To Bandicut , she muttered , " Kim 's with exoarch . " He nodded . The voice from the comm said , " We may have a find . It 's an object of some kind , buried about thirty meters deep , just within buggy range to the northeast . I do n't know how we missed it before , but it showed up when they repeated some of the orbital scans yesterday . It just came in . We 're trying to analyze the data now . We could use your help . " Julie froze , electrified . Finally she murmured , " Out near  --  navpoint Wendy , by any chance ? " " Yeah . How 'd you know ? " She looked at Bandicut with a mixture of excitement , apology , and pleading for forgiveness . He shrugged helplessly . " I 'll be right there , " she said into the comm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I 'm really sorry ! But this could he ? " Her voice caught . " Just what you 've been waiting for , right ? " he croaked . She nodded , swallowing . She looked breathtakingly beautiful as she buttoned her shirt and ran her fingers back through her hair . " I 'll let you know what we find , " she promised , leaning to touch his lips with a parting kiss . " You 're so sweet I almost ca n't stand it . " She gave him another parting kiss .  | He stood up , readjusting his clothing . " I 'll call you , " he promised . " Or you call me . Or something . Okay ? " " Okay , " she whispered . " Bye . " " Bye , " he murmured , and slipped out the door .  | ///John , if that 's my translator they found , we could be in trouble . /// Bandicut shrugged irritably as they made their way back toward his own dorm . He was concerned , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and farther out of his control ; but deep down , he was having trouble sharing the quarx 's worries about the translator . /// I hope you noticed that I did n't interrupt you this time .

Why did some-t hing always go wrong anytime he started to like a woman ? /Who said you were a miserable . . . whatever you just said ? / he muttered . /// You did . The other night . /// /I did ? I must have been mad. / He entered the dorm and climbed into his bunk with a groan , snapping the privacy curtain closed . /I wonder how Julie managed to get a pri-  | vate room , anyway .

And I have a feeling that the new orbital scan that took Julie away from you was prompted by my blunder . So we both lost out today . /// Bandicut closed his eyes , alternately trying to forget , and then to recapture , the memory of Julie . /Yeah , / he said . /Look , I 'm sorry I called you a perverse , stinking little pip-squeak ? / /// That 's not what you called me . You called me a ? /// /Never mind . I 'm just sorry , okay ? / The quarx was silent for a moment . /// Okay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to the translator before anyone else does . Really important . /// Bandicut scowled. /Why ? It can protect itself , ca n't it ? / /// Sure . But possibly at the cost of our being able to reach it . It might decide to sink out of reach , to avoid contact . We ca n't let that happen . ///  | IT thought you said it would do what it had to , to stay in touch with us. / /// I said I thought . But I ca n't be absolutely sure . /// /Well  --  I do n't see what I can do about it , anyway , / Bandicut muttered . /Say , you know , it might be a good idea for us to browse the system board and see what people are saying about sabotage . To see if anyone 's onto us. / /// Getting back out there is more urgent . /// /Well , I ca n't get out there until my ankle 's healed . Even if Switzer signs me off , I wo n't be ready for hopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking , maybe there 's a way to make you heal faster . /// Bandicut snorted . /How ? By magic ? That reminds me , I have n't taken those stupid pills. / He sat up and groped in his bunk storage cubby for the bottle of pills that Switzer had given him . He shook three of them out and took them with a swallow of water from a half-empty drinking bulb . /// Not magic . But it 's occurred to me that maybe , with my help . . . /// Bandicut wished he could see the quarx face to face . /Physical intervention ? Can you do that ? / He almost felt the quarx frown . ///At first , I did n't think so . But I 've been thinking about the fever I induced by touching your nerve impulses . And I 've been remembering some meditational techniques that I believe could help you focus upon your ankle 's healing and speed it up from within . /// Bandicut blinked . Mind-techniques ? Even if it were true . . . /Would you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not precisely . But your body knows what to do . I would just help it concentrate and do it faster . I 've done it before , in past lifetimes . /// /But never with a human. / /// Obviously not . But I 'd never done it with a Peloinang , either . Or a Ffffftink . But it worked with them . And on tougher hurts than broken bones . I remember parts of it vividly . /// Bandicut suddenly felt like another player in a long line of players , in a game he did n't understand . /Are you in the habit of getting your hosts badly injured ? / The quarx sighed and did n't answer . Instead he began to hum a low , rhythmic chant . /What are you doing ? / But it was obvious what he was doing , and Bandicut 's protest died of its own accord . The sound was oddly compelling , not just soothing and restful , but evocative as well . Despite his own resistance , Bandicut found his thoughts filling with restful images of water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he felt a female presence nearby , not arousing but comforting , a pair of feminine hands stroking and kneading tension out of his muscles . The sensation was so real that he began to feel cries of relief from his knotted muscles , and he thought , go up just a little , now to the right . . . ahhhhh . The imagined hands found just the right spot . Charlie 's humming chant changed in timbre and pitch , and Bandicut could have sworn that his muscles were responding with their own minds to the sound  --  relaxing , and allowing oxygen to flow where tension had blocked it before . He experimentally tightened his left shoulder ; it responded , but as he released it , it relaxed again into the swell of the hum . p 249 /// The more you surrender control , the better . /// For an instant , he thought of asking for a nice , relaxing image of Julie to surrender to ; but he could hear the tsk , tsk of the quarx leading him in more restful directions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and imagined that he was floating in a hot , swirling mineral bath .. . He began to see new images , gazing inward into his own mind/body/being . He glimpsed a welter of tensions and frustrations and longings  --  shuttered windows onto deep pains and sorrows of the past , like the loss of his parents and brother and sister-in-law , and the one comfort that was his young niece Dakota . He flickered upon a memory of sitting with her parents , watching her play in a VR booth , her seven-year-old face frowning in tight concentration as she worked at piloting a ship through an imaginary spacewarp , trying to reach . . . what was it ? . . . the universe of rainbow snow . He wondered wistfully if he would ever see Dakota again . He was suddenly aware of the years of loneliness that had built up inside him , and his occasional feelings of emotional exile , which the neurolink had done so much to assuage , until it had been torn from him .. . He began to tighten up , pulling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved him through them with a whispered , /// Not now . Those things take time to heal . We have simpler business now . /// A new image took over , a vision of a stream of golden light pouring into a room , bathing away the hurt of the memories , not changing what had happened , but soothing those hurts and others that rose to find balm . The golden light flowed toward the physical injuries in his body . Skeletal muscles relaxed and tightened again , gently ; the muscles holding the bones of his left ankle began to draw themselves into a natural conformation that put  | just the right tension on the half-healed fracture that ran through one of those bones .. . What are we doing ? he thought dreamily . /// Trust your body to know . /// Moments later he glimpsed the actual break , and the edges that needed joining , and he saw the places where the alignment was imperfect . He felt his muscles contract slightly , until the edges shifted into the best fit . Nerve end ings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into something that said , this is right . . . and the flow of histamines stopped , and calcium and phosphate ions and oxygen and glucose flowed more freely and accurately .. . and he could almost see the cells bathed in the nutrient sea , churning out new bone . And in the break , the bone was knitting itself together without a trace of a scar , following blueprints held within each one of those glowing cells .. . When he woke , it was to the sound of the quarx saying , /// . . . got to get something to eat . You need fuel . . . /// He blinked his eyes open , startled to realize that he 'd gone to sleep . For a moment , he could not identify what he was feeling . Then he realized he was ravenous . He had n't eaten a thing last night ; he had slept straight through from late afternoon to morning . Pushing himself up , he felt a wave of lightheadedness . He felt drained and hung over . /What have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Healing you . We demanded a lot of your body , while you slept . After you eat , we 've got to see the good doctor . /// It took an effort to get down from his bunk , but once he 'd been upright for a few moments , he felt better . /I would hesitate to give Switzer the benefit of that title , / he grunted , testing his ankle . He felt nothing  --  but then , with the cast on , he had n't felt too much anyway .  | /// Well , whatever we call him , he 's going to be mighty amazed . . . /// Switzer stared at the readouts , scratching his head . " Bandicut , I do n't think you even need that cast anymore . 01 ' King Cole is going to love you . " Bandicut blinked . " Say again ? " " Jackson . I 'm telling him that you 're cleared for driving duty today . But , " Switzer added , frowning as he tapped Bandicut 's ankle through the fastract cast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more day , just to play it safe . There 've been too many damned weird things about you lately . " He gave the cast a good rap with his knuckles . " Feel anything ? " Bandicut shrugged . " I feel you hitting me . " " Do you feel any pain ? " He shook his head . " No fever ? Never mind , I can read it right here . " Switzer pulled the readout plugs out of the cast . " You can go to work . Hell , you can play soccer , for all I care . Come back tomorrow to get the cast off . " He shook his gray-haired head and turned away with a dismissive gesture . It was clear he regarded Bandicut as an annoying enigma , and the sooner the man was out of his sight the better . Bandicut was happy to oblige him . As he walked to the exo-ops center , Bandicut conceded , /That 's pretty amazing , what you did . The ankle feels great . It seems silly to still have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleased . But now , my friend , comes the time for us to earn our keep . /// Bandicut started to give a jaunty reply , but swallowed it when he realized exactly what the quarx meant . He 'd met the translator once before , and he had n't liked the experience , not at all .  | THE DEEP BLUE Neptune was a comforting compan ion in the midnight sky , as he drove toward nay point Wendy . In the week since he 'd last been out in a buggy , Triton had completed slightly more than one tidal-locked orbit of Neptune , and the mother planet was once again in crescent phase , a slender scythe in the sky . Whatever misgivings he had about the surreptitious mission he was about to undertake for Charlie , he could not resist the pleasure of the solitude , and the view . He knew there were not too many other people who would have considered this a scenic drive , but he loved the rugged desolation under Neptune 's regal presence . He sometimes wondered if there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as jaded by it as everyone else . /// Do you ever get this sort of feeling for your homeworld ? /// Charlie asked , as they bobbed and bumped over the land scape . Bandicut squinted , picking out a course through the hilly nitrogen ices. /I du n no . Sometimes , I guess . Why ? / /// You do n't seem to think of Earth that often . Or of people you left behind . /// Bandicut shrugged . /Did n't really leave a whole lot of  | people behind . My family 's gone  --  you already know that . Except my niece , of course . And a few friends . But not really any close friends , I guess. / /// Is that hard for you to accept ? /// /What are you , a damn shrink ? I 'm alone . So what ? Lots of people are alone. / For a few moments , the quarx did n't reply . Bandicut tried to concentrate on his driving . He glanced off to his left and watched Napoleon galloping over the dunes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robot to check in with them . /// What about Dakota ? /// Charlie asked suddenly . Bandicut growled in annoyance. /What about her ? / He waggled the control stick , making the buggy veer left , then right . He was annoyed because he was feeling distracted and guilty ; he 'd gotten a message from Julie , saying that cxoarch seemed to be onto something exciting , but they could n't send out a team until more orbital scans had been done . He felt as if he were lying to her . ///I 'm trying to understand , that 's all . Dakota 's your niece , right ? So you do n't have a relationship with her the way you would , say , with Julie . /// /Obviously. / /// Therefore , this thing that you 're doing , putting your earnings in trust for her , is something that you 're doing for no other reason than that you care for her ? /// /Yeah , so ?

He instinctively pulled back on the power . /What the hell is that supposed to mean , Charlie ? Yeah , I 'd miss it . I 'd miss it a lot . Why ? / Charlie stirred with an unusual restlessness . /// Nothing ... exactly . Let 's hope the question never comes up . /// /Then why 'd you bring it up ? / ///Just ... trying to understand your emotions . /// Bandicut grunted suspiciously and gunned the motor . The buggy crested a rise with a dim puff of snow , and on his console , two arrows converged . Time to get started . I le keyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ APPROACHING NAVPOINT WENDY .

Let 's just do it right. / Bandicut stood with his hand tingling on the robot 's outer case . He wanted to ask Charlie exactly what he was doing to Napoleon 's programming , but he sensed that the quarx was too deep in his work to answer . He only knew that fairly complex instructions were passing through his skin  | and glove into the robot 's central processor . The tingling fluctuated for a moment , then faded . /// Okay . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creaking sound over the comm and stared with its black holocam eyes . " Of course , John Bandicut , I will assist as requested . " " Yes , good , " Bandicut said , clearing his throat . Charlie had apparently just instructed the robot to carry on with the survey in his stead while they set out on foot to the cavern . /What now ? / /// Starting in nineteen minutes , we will have a forty-nine-minute period in which there will be no spacecraft or satellites overhead . /// Bandicut took a slow , deep breath . /All right .

Bandicut opened his visor and ate a chocolate bar . He tried to ignore the butterflies in his stomach . He knew it had to be done , but he was starting to feel like a criminal . /// Time . Let 's go . /// Bandicut opened the bubble canopy and climbed out . Napoleon had already clambered up onto the side of the rover and plugged in its probe . As soon as Bandicut stepped clear , the robot drove off , hanging from the rover like a monkey . /That thing better be back here on time , / Bandicut said uneasily .  | /// It will . Let 's go . Bearing zero-five-four. /// Bandicut sprang ahead in the one-thirteenth gravity and loped across the uneven icy surface , across the invisible STOP HERE line , into the unauthorized sector where he and Charlie had first met. /// Right here . /// Panting , he came to a stop . He had been jogging for ten minutes at the most , but it felt more like an hour . It wasnt easy , stumping across that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would have been impossible in Earth gravity . He peered around over the frozen nitrogen and methane surface . /Is this it ? / It looked vaguely familiar ; but a lot of places out here looked like a lot of other places . And the last time he was here , the translator had been busy rearranging the landscape . The quarx did n't answer . But an instant later , he felt his feet sinking slowly into the ice . Then he was falling , and he was suddenly aware of sparkles of light whirling around him , and his vision and the rest of his consciousness went cottony and vague .. . He blinked in darkness , and found just enough light to see that he was standing directly in front of the translator  --  the same machine , with its pulsing , squirming , not-quite-solid black and iridescent spheres , which had started him on this crazy path . He felt that he was dreaming , but knew he was n't . The translator looked even more alive than before  --  this thing that belonged , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of years before humanity , but to some other race lost even deeper in time and space . Bandicut felt that he was underground in the ice cavern , but saw nothing to confirm it ; his vision was completely dominated by the spinning globes moving around each other and through each other . p 257 He felt a palpable and urgent sense of purpose in the translator . He also saw something now that he had not before , a curious point of darkness floating inside one of the iridescent spheres , like a tiny shadow in the light . It caught his attention , because it did not seem to be just a fleck of physical matter , but more like a pure geometric point . The word singularity flickered in his mind , and he had no idea if that was what it was ; but even as he was wondering , it caught his gaze with a wrench . He felt his vision telescoping down into that point of blackness . His breath escaped with an explosive rush . He was falling into a microscopic universe of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dancing fire  --  and found it disturbing to look at . These were not chemical flames , but something far more fundamental , something burning and fusing deep in the uttermost building blocks of space-time . . . and whatever it was , it was bright , painfully so . And yet it was not the brightness so much as the strangeness that tore at his eyes . He wanted to call out to Charlie , but could not . It felt as though he were peering into the heart of a quantum black hole ; nothing here quite fit anything that he knew or understood . It was almost as if he were being pulled into some tightly compacted dimension of reality , a corner of the universe that the human eye was never intended to see . ? It was n't whispered a voice , which might have been the quarx 's , or his own imagination . It was suddenly lost in a rising babble of voices , chaotic voices , speaking no language he knew , but reverberating in his mind , coming from within , coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within this quarxian madness . He was suddenly feverish with a rush of knowledge flowing into his mind , carried on the tide of voices . He was faint with it , he was dizzy and bewildered ; he did n't know if  | he could hold or comprehend it all , and he could only hope that the quarx could . Charlie . . . was Charlie still here ? Images were building within him , images formed by knowledge gathering like atoms around a nucleating body , and soon they would crystalize abruptly into a vast clarity of --  ( what ? ) - - You will see --  the chaotic movement , the danger --  a ticking molecular pendulum , marking time -- a glimpse of tumbling rock and ice , perturbed from it s orbit , far from the sun --  falling inward , across endless space ; hurtling close to the sun and then away --  ( is this ? ) - - yes --  a glimpse of a blue-and-white planet , floating serene in the darkness , a living world --  the comet rising like a tremendous curving fastball , streaking toward the planet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with --  fire-fire ! - The fire seemed to spin around him , or he was spinning , and he felt himself caught in a transformation of time and space , and for a terrifying moment he thought this was nothing but silence-fugue , not alien wisdom or knowledge at all ... except that now the previous images vanished and he saw a figure of coruscating fire , alive and aware , in the heart of the darkness , and he could not tell if it was the quarx or the translator , or both . Before he could ask , three blazing points of light erupted from the figure of fire and spun toward him , circling into tight orbits around his head , and then dropping into his pockets . ? these you will need He tried to focus on the points of light , but could not .  | Something new was building around him like a pressure wave , and with it was a growing sensation of unreality , and he felt himself wanting to scream , but he could not . He opened his mouth and darkness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fire --  and he glimpsed cavern walls flashing and shimmer-ing- ? and he heard a quarx crying out --  and the darkness shrank down to a penetrating point --  and spun away -- and everything blurred lie thought he heard a deep gong ringing in the darkness , but this darkness was of a different sort . It was the darkness of space , and there was a blue planet arching over his head . He blinked dizzily , trying to stand . He saw ice under his feet , and realized that he was standing on the surface right where he had begun this madness .. . /// Do n't faint ! /// the quarx barked . He caught himself stumbling . Whatever he had just been through , he felt as drained as he had this morning , after his healing . /// Start walking  --  to your left !

He was up to a full , loping run now , panting steadily , letting the quarx direct his feet as he ran toward their rendezvous with the robot , all the time trying desperately to focus on the memory that was rising now toward the surface .. . It was a planet , blue and white , Earth , homeworld , floating serene and vulnerable through the vast eternal night of space ; it was oblivious to the motions of certain bodies from the edge of the solar system , one of which was now tumbling inward at hellbent velocity . He stumbled on a ripple of ice and pitched forward , gasping . He pushed himself back up to his hands and knees , the image quaking with crystalline clarity in his mind : The Earth burning . ///John , do n't stop . You 've got to keep moving . /// He struggled to get up , but his legs and arms felt like p 261 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head and saw another blue planet , its atmosphere clouding over with smoke and ash . ///John , please ? /// /Charlie ? / he gasped / ? is that really going to hap-pen ? / /// Yes , if we do n't stop it . It 's closer than I imagined . /// /When ? / he croaked . /// Impact in forty-seven days . Now get up and run , damn it ! RUN . ///  | THE ROVER CAME over the hill to the north , kicking up a cloud of ice particles as it sped down the slope . At any other time , Bandicut would have been terrified by the sight of the robot driving his buggy that way , hanging off the side like a remora fish , the buggy slewing to come straight toward him before braking to a stop . Now , he was simply too numb to care . " John Bandicut , survey strips three-A through five-B are completed . What further needs do you have ? " Napoleon squawked , raising itself up on the cowling of the rover as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were trying to peer into the driver 's compartment to see what he was planning to do next . /Charlie ? / he asked , buckling himself in. /// Place your hand on the robot , please . /// Bandicut reached out and touched Napoleon . He found the gesture oddly calming , like petting a dog . /Are we releasing it now ? / /// Yes . Recon Thirty-nine , terminate and delete special programming Beta . Confirm . /// p 263 " Termination confirmed , " squawked the robot . " John Bandicut , do you have further needs ? " " Ah . . . negative , Nappy . Go ahead and take up your regular station , I guess . " As the robot unjacked and let itself back down onto the moon 's surface , Bandicut suddenly realized that , according to his work orders , he was to stay out here for three more hours before returning to base . He did n't think he could stand to wait that long . /Charlie , if that 's really true , about the comet ? / @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get back ! Do you have all the orbital data ? Is that what all that gibberish was , from the translator ? / /// Some of it . And yes , I can give you the figures , but they 're a complex interaction . I 'll be able to show you better in the VR room . /// /Never mind showing me . Can you show the people who can do something about it ? / ///John  --  remember ? There 's only one person who can do something about it . And that 's you . /// Bandicut swallowed , his blood rushing . /Charlie , what can I do ? We 've got to notify somebody ! / /// We 've been through this before . Your planet has no defense . Not against this . /// Bandicut had trouble catching his breath . /No , but ? what about  --  fusion warheads ? ? / He was clenching and unclenching his fists . Napoleon was looking back at him from the top of the knoll. /// Perhaps you should start driving . I 'm afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | It is likely they would only split the comet , and make its effects all the more devastating . /// /But we should at least warn people , / Bandicut whispered . /// Please start driving . Your people would not believe a warning from us . The comet is behind the sun , hidden from the only stations that might confirm its orbit . Please start driving . /// Bandicut snapped the joystick forward , and the buggy lurched ahead , wheels churning on nitrogen ice . " Exo-op control , Unit Echo , " he croaked , pressing the long-range comm . " I 'm coming in early . This ankle cast is killing me . Copy ? " " COPY , ECHO . HI , BANDIE . SHALL I ALERT , AH , ANYONE IN PARTICULAR ? " answered the cheerful voice of Georgia Patwell . Bandicut sighed . " Negative , control . See you soon . " At least he was grateful for Dr. Switzer 's casual treatment . If he had n't had an excuse to come in early , he would have gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually , that he might go crazy anyway . /// Do n't forget the daughter-stones. /// /Eh ? / An image flickered , and he remembered the three points of light from the translator flying to him and dropping into his suit pocket . /What was that , anyway ? / he asked , driving into the hangar area . /// Daughter components of the translator . They 're essential for what we have to do . Keep them with you at all times . /// /Uh , okay. / Rolling to a stop , he secured the buggy and hurried inside . After dressing , he reached into the suit outer pocket to find three small , translucent stones . They looked like glass marbles , one obsidian , one ruby red , one glittering white . He thought he saw a faint sparkle of light glow- p 265 ing within the white one , but it died immediately , and there was no other sign that they were anything other than glass stones . /What should I do with them ? / he asked , rolling them in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and watching them disappear under various immovable objects . /// They 'll stay in your pocket if you direct your thoughts to them , asking them to . I 'll tell you more about them later . Let 's go . /// Bandicut shrugged and dropped the stones into his pocket . Then he grabbed a terminal to submit his field report , and called Switzer 's office to say that he wanted the cast taken off . He was told to come by in two hours . Perfect . He headed straight for the lounge . Locking himself into a VR room , he switched on a solarsystem realtime program and perched on a stool , surrounded by a panoply of stars , with a glowing sun floating in space some distance away . At Charlie 's request , he put on a neurojack headset and adjusted the controls until all nine of the planets were enlarged enough for their features to be recognizable in the dark interplanetary gulf  --  the outer planets with their cloud bands and rings , Mars a rusty pebble , Earth a blue-and-white gem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the background like an infinite tapestry , while allowing him to see clearly the movements of the planets . /// Splendid . The translator can make do with raw numbers . But this makes it much easier to visualize , does n't it ? /// /I guess so . What exactly are we visualizing ? / /// In a manner of speaking . . . EineySteiney pool . I 'm downloading the orbital data now . Waiting for the VR program to process it . . .
