SATURDAYS CAN GET PRETTY busy around our house . Along with having to get Kirsten , who is five years old , to her ballet class by 10:00 , and Eric , who is eight , to his karate class by 11:30 , there are groceries to be bought and laundry to be done , and gym class for both of them at 1:30 . Like many dual income families , my wife and I have to get as much done on the weekend as possible , which does not , unfortunately , seem to leave us much time to relax with the kids . But a busy weekend schedule does not mean that we do n't get to have quality time with the children . On the contrary , some of the best conversations and some of the most enjoyable games I have had with my kids have taken place while loading laundry into the dryer , or searching the aisles of the grocery store for a breakfast cereal we can all agree on . The trick is to be aware of the moments when they happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack Albin , director of psychology at the Children 's Psychiatric Research Institute in London , Ontario , the struggle to find some relaxed , unstructured time to spend with my children is one I share with many other fathers . " A lot of parents are finding that their lives are just too full and too organized to allow for much spontaneous time with their kids . In a home with two working parents there may be some free time available during the preparation of the evening meal and at bedtime , but we are talking minutes here , not hours . " And it is important that fathers do find that special time to be with their children  --  important for both father and child . In their book Finding Time for Fathering ( Fawcett Columbine , 1992 ) , Mitch and Susan Golant observe that a relationship between a father and a child that is based on mutual trust and respect , and which allows both the parent and child to feel good about themselves , will not only make the father feel that he is making a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but will have some very tangible benefits for the child . According to the Golants , a solid father - child relationship " will help your youngster be more successful in school , in relationships with their friends , and in their adjustment to being male or female . There is everything to gain and nothing to lose in finding time for fathering ; it 's only a matter of fine - tuning your approach . " But in a world where time is becoming a scarce commodity , divided up and parcelled out to careers , domestic obligations and social responsibilities , and where what little spare time we have already seems fine - tuned almost to the point of oblivion , finding time for fathering can seem a nearly impossible task . The experience of almost having to schedule time to be with the kids is one I share with other fathers . Mike Merritt , for instance , a father of two small children whose wife works as a teaching assistant , finds that in order to spend time with his children , that is not cluttered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to consciously set some time aside in the evening which is just for the kids . When I come home , I need time to change gears before I can really be there for Kate and Gailyn . Not until I have had my half an hour or so to go for a run or do a work - out can I leave work behind , and get down on the floor to play Lego or whatever . My best time is after dinner and before bedtime , as long as there is nothing else going on . But I would have to say that I do wish I had more time to spend with the kids than I do . " So how do we find that " quality time , " and what do we do with it once we have it ? It is an unfortunate reality that , to begin with , many of today 's fathers have a rather fuzzy notion of what quality time is . A lot of us were brought up in North American households during a period in our society 's history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all day looking after the children , while dad 's responsibility was to be the wage - earner . Even then , what little time we did spend with our fathers tended to be instructional , structured time  --  learning how to play baseball or how to fix the car , or being taught how to become responsible citizens with a good work ethic by having to clean out the garage . Our dads may have been many things  --  good providers and good teachers and constant authority figures , but a lot of modern fathers would probably not consider their own fathers as having been good nurturers . Dr. Beth Mitchell , director of psychology at the Children 's Hospital of Western Ontario in London , Ontario , makes the observation that first - time fathers in particular will often think with some misgivings about their own upbringing when planning how they are going to rear their children . " Dads will reflect on their own past when it comes to playing with their children , and it is important that they do n't let their experiences have a negative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Few would identify their fathers as truly excellent role models in the areas of nurturing and play . " Dr. Albin adds that " A lot of us grew up with fathers who were either absent , or whose roles at home were rigidly circumscribed by their own and society 's expectations . " Feeding the baby , changing diapers , kissing away tears and soothing wounded egos were not part of the behavioural repertoire of most of our fathers , largely because society did not encourage it . The good news is that society 's expectations of what a father 's role within the family should be is changing . As we learn more about how important it is for fathers to bond with their children right from the beginning , society is beginning to promote more nurturing and involvement on the part of modern dads . The not - so - good news is that many of us have no real clue as to how we should express that desire to be involved with our kids . Dr. Mitchell notes that " a lot of dads still see themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as their fathers did , along with trying to be more involved and nurturing . This can lead to some real confusion for fathers . " Dr. Mitchell sees these dads as needing to understand that they do n't have to be tagged as the " heavy " in the family  --  that they can nurture as well as discipline . " The form of quality time that the dads find with their kids really does not matter , as long as it happens . Their time with their kids should be free of other pressures , and the time should be child - directed , meaning that the child should take the lead as to what happens . Playing cards or board games , wrestling on the floor or going for a walk and holding hands are an excellent example of how time can be spent together . " Jan Figurski , whose son , Tamber , is 16 and whose daughter , Emma , is seven , echoes the sentiment that some of the best time with his son comes when it is not scheduled . " A few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ games together , in some cases in cities several hours drive away . I did it initially in order to share an event with Tamber , but as it turned out , although we have fun at the game , the real quality time happens in the car as we drive to wherever we are going . With nothing to distract us , we can talk for hours about all sorts of things . " The message seems to be that the best time with our children comes when it is spontaneous . For me and my children , meal preparation has turned from being a daily chore to more of an event as the kids want to involve themselves with chopping vegetables and peeling carrots or whatever , and with no television to disturb us  --  and as long as I can keep my own agenda in check  --  conversation invariably flows naturally around the subjects the children find interesting . As Jan Figurski points out , opportunities for quality time present themselves especially around rituals and family traditions , such as meal preparation . What turns a ritual into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Every Sunday for the past 15 years I have made cre@pes for breakfast , " Figurski says , " and my children look forward to sharing in the preparation of the food . " Unfortunately , as society comes to recognize the importance of a father 's contribution to children 's emotional needs , fewer and fewer families are staying together . According to projections made by Statistics Canada , close to 40 percent of marriages in Canada will end in separation or divorce , resulting in a large number of single - parent families and common - law arrangements . What this means for most single dads is that quality time becomes time on the weekends , or a week at Christmas , or two weeks in the summer and , instead of being spontaneous and stress - free , the time a divorced father spends with a child can become pretty intense . As Dr. Albin says , " Quality time becomes departmentalized , and divorced dads sometimes try to pack too much into what time they have available to spend with their child , which can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have a father who is constant , whose expectations are reasonable and who is relaxed and able to let the child take the lead on what the two of them should do together , even if that time only happens every second weekend , " continues Dr. Albin , " than to have a father who lives in the house , but who has unreasonable expectations , or who is simply not involved . " What we are doing when we spend time with our children is modelling . We are teaching our children to become the kinds of adults we would be ourselves if we could . We make mistakes and we do n't always havethe right answers , but we are trying to give our kids the best . Dr. Albin suggests that " a close , intimate , communicating relationship that is stable and which includes components of discipline , instruction and nurturing is the kind that will help our children do better than we did when we were kids . " And as Dr. Beth Mitchell adds , " Just be there for them . Tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When it comes to spending quality time with my kids , trying to remember that it is me they want  --  not my activities or my knowledge or my experience , but just me and my willingness to listen to what they have to say and do what they want to do  --  helps to reduce my anxiety about doing a good job as a dad . And the rewards are there , of course , in watching how the children learn to interact with others , and in how they model patience and co - operation . One day , for instance , when a friend came to call on my son , Eric , I heard him say , with an eight - year - old 's almost Zen - like awareness of what was going on , that he would love to come out , but he wanted to finish playing with his dad first . He could have lavished no greater praise on me than that . Otte Rosenkrantz combines freelance writing with being a stay - at - home dad .

KIDS SPEAK OUT In our attempt to determine what constitutes quality time between a parent and child , we sometimes forget to ask the experts . Who is better qualified than our children when it comes to telling us how they like to spend time with their parents ? Here 's what some of them had to say . Heather , age 12 " I like to work on hobbies with my dad . We do model railroading together , and we build balsa airplanes . I like having my mom help me with my homework or school projects , and with both my parents , I like going on outings such as the museum . " Eric , age 8 " I like when my dad helps me with my homework while he listens to As It Happens on the radio . I also like playing Monopoly with my dad , and the table hockey game I got for Christmas . I also like doing the groceries with either my dad or my mom . " Abby , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dad is play floor - hockey in the basement . I always win . " Alex , age 12 " In the summer I like riding my bike with my dad , and in the winter , I like riding the bus . I also like playing board games , and I like it when my dad and I read to each other in the evenings . " Kirsten , age 5 " I like it when my dad plays with me in the morning before I go to kindergarten . We play computer games and Tic Tac Toe and sometimes we paint pictures . I also like making homemade bread with my dad . " Alana , age 5 " I like it when my dad and I go tobogganing at the golf course . I also like going for walks and board games . " Tamber , age 16 " My biological dad and I are into watching baseball together ; we also play checkers when we get a chance . My stepdad and I usually go on hikes together .
