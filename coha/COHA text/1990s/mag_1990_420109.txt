Section : LIFESTYLE HEALTH George Bush has a new weapon in the battle to get our kids in shape <p> Let us now praise those wonderfully downbeat President 's Council on Physical Fitness commercials of days gone by . Grim , grainy and I black and white , they had a certain film noir quality that stood out among the Colgate-with-Gardol and Speedy Alka-Seltzer spots . Vintage PCPF commercials consisted largely of Stan Musial or Bud Wilkinson addressing the camera while wearing unflattering " coaches ' shorts . " " Kids today are sadly out of shape , " the spokesmen always said . In the sea of silliness that was ' 50s and ' 60s TV , the bad news was bracing  --  a refreshing reminder of the complications of the real world . <p> But in the age of " Married . . . With Children , " realism is no longer rare , so PCPF commercials could never be the attention-grabbers they once were . Meanwhile , the need to get school-age kids up and moving not only endures : it grows more critical with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generation of parents may be aerobicized and carbo-loaded to the gills  --  but more than half of all female grade-school students and about a quarter of the boys , one study shows , ca n't perform a single pull-up . According to the National Association for Sport and Physical Education , 40 percent of children ages 5 to 8 are obese , inactive or have elevated blood pressure or cholesterol levels . How are we going to reach them , not to mention their teachers and the school administrators responsible for funding phys-ed programs ? There are no simple answers . But the Bush administration is experimenting with a policy that can be summed up in two words : Arnold Schwarzenegger . <p> As chairman of what is now known as the President 's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports , the 43-year-old film star plans to tour all 50 states in the next year and report to George Bush on the condition of phys ed in the U.S. Clearly , we have come a long way from Richard M. Nixon , the council 's first chairman in 1956 . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he does in the movies ? The Austrian-born star of " The Terminator " and " Total Recall " wo n't be able to venture an educated guess for a few months . Yet in a recent interview with NEWSWEEK , Schwarzenegger indicated that he is finding what most people find when looking into kid fitness : a hodgepodge of the inspiring and the awful . " I 've seen some good results and some lousy situations , " says the man who began working out four hours a day at 15 . While there are many fit kids , there are many more , he says , " who look like dumplings . " <p> " Hi Arnold , " shriek the sixth graders at Astoria Middle School in Astoria , Ore. , as Schwarzenegger arrives , one recent morning , wearing baggy blue shorts , a white T shirt and sparkling white Reeboks . " We 're HUNGRY . " This is what they say to their phys-ed instructors , Max Bigby and Colleen Tilley , all the time . Their hunger is for physical challenges , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has arranged to drop by this school while he is shooting a movie called " Kindergarten Cop " nearby . Schwarzenegger scans the AMS gymnasium , picks out an 11-year-old boy and asks the student to do some pushups . The kid drops to the floor and pumps up and down so enthusiastically that , after a few minutes , Schwarzenegger has to ask him to stop . There are , after all , a lot of students to be seen this morning . Fifty-five sixth graders have come to " class , " even though this is a Saturday morning , several days after the school year officially ended . <p> In the co-ed workout , which is next on his agenda , Arnold watches as kids make their way around a 12-station obstacle course , climbing ropes , leaping over a vaulting horse , slam-dunking a basketball  --  after launching themselves off a mini-trampoline . One need n't be an expert to notice that Astoria Middle School has an exceptional phys-ed program . The sixth graders there spend four 42-minute class periods each week in their well-equipped gym  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heading into the new academic year , 29 states , including Oregon , require less than 10 minutes per day of physical education  --  and only Illinois mandates daily gym classes for all students . <p> Even in a school with an exemplary program , some kids resist getting fit . Grabbing one end of the rope that 's attached to the rafters , Arnold asks one girl to demonstrate her climbing technique . She tries weakly , groans and slides to the floor . <p> " What was that ? " Schwarzenegger asks . " Try again . " <p> The second time she does much better , and gets a pat on the back from the actor . Later , Arnold tells an interviewer that , according to the latest fitness surveys , upper-body strength is a particular weak spot among American youth  --  and has been since Dwight Eisenhower started the President 's Council . " We have closed the gym doors to our kids , " he says . " In the last 10 years , the only gain in fitness in this country has been by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The inner cities have been left out , and our children have been left out . Without P.E. , you take away their basic right of being physically fit . " <p> But fitness is one " right " that is not fervently embraced by the populace . Rather , it has to be sold to school administrators ( who have limited budgets to work with ) , parents ( who might think every available cent should go to computer classes ) and students ( who , whatever the subject matter , would rather be doing something else ) . The fact that a celebrity such as Schwarzenegger serves as chairman of the President 's Council is only one example of the marketing techniques that phys-ed proponents use . In 1987 , P.E . teachers and administrators successfully lobbied Congress for a resolution that calls for " high quality daily physical education programs for all children in kindergarten through grade 12 "  --  albeit without providing the bucks to make that happen . The members of NASPE also conduct an aggressive public-relations program called Fit to Achieve , which produces television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trumpeting the importance of physical education . <p> Vital statistics : In the classroom , the selling takes many forms . At Iowa 's Tilford Middle School , P.E . teacher Beth Kirkpatrick has amassed ( largely through donations from manufacturers ) about $100,000 worth of state-of-the-art equipment . The machines are hardly the only way to achieve fitness , but they do make the process more attractive to adolescent minds . Before Tilford students run their daily mile , they strap on electronic monitors that calculate their heart rates and record their vital statistics in a computer . When they 're in gym , they hang upside-down in gravity boots , the way possums  --  and Yuppies  --  do . The kids can measure their body fat with skin monitors , check their stress level with electromyograms and wear $200 " beeping " sneakers that can keep track of a runner 's mileage . " A kid in today 's society expects to see computerization , " says Kirkpatrick . " I ca n't wait for people to say , Gee we 've got to solve our fitness problem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look like 1940 . If you walk into my class , you hear computers beeping , shoes beeping . If you have that , you have the kids ' attention . " <p> At Ridgewood High School in New Jersey , the gym class that gets the most notice is called Project Adventure . Based on the Outward Bound program , the mandatory course has an obstacle course of ropes , logs , planks and tires . The kids , working in groups , learn about teamwork as they make their way over 18-footbrick walls and through 68-foot trees and other available obstacles that have been worked into the course at no extra cost to the school . If one member gives up at any point , his or her whole group must start again . But because the settings and the challenges are so spectacular , says David B. Marsh , director of health , physical education and athletics for the Ridgewood Public Schools , " kids are literally pounding on the door to get into class , and when the course is over , they want to come after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If Ridgewood or Tilford were the norm , Schwarzenegger could stick to his moviemaking and other business pursuits . The problem , as he has already begun to see , is that in too many schools , phys ed means shooting a few hoops once a week . Recent research shows that because exercise can increase blood flow to the brain there may be an additional payoff in heightened cognitive capacity . A study conducted by Dr. Roy Shephard , a University of Toronto professor , found out that when time was taken away from academic subjects such as English and math , and devoted to phys ed , students performed better on both fitness and classroom tests . Expensive , high-tech gym equipment is not necessary for achieving the benefits of exercise . The most important thing is to encourage kids to play regularly in a way that involves sustained physical activity . ( Grade-school teachers who have kids do light calisthenics in classrooms to " shake the sleepies out " have long known this . ) <p> Schwarzenegger understands that exercise does more than build muscles . " Sports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he says . " You learn to take risks , face pain , struggle . " Arnold will need to call on that experience as he makes his way around America and finds , it seems safe to say , too many dumpling factories where phys-ed programs should be . His job is a tough one . But so far he has managed , like the President 's Council commercials of yore , to at least get our attention . <p> GRAPH : Dumping Decade . Kids missed out on the fitness craze of the ' 80s . Body mass , a fitness index based on the ratio of weight to height , climbed ominously in American 10- and 11-years-olds . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Fitnees ups and downs : Teen hangout in Iowa , obstacle course in New Jersey <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Some good results , some lousy situations ' : Schwarzeneger at Astoria Middle School <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Fitness toys : Electronic heart monitor <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Smart sneaker : A Puma with a memory <p> By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p>
