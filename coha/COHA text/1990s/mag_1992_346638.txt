It is conventional usage to refer to Ross Perot as a third-party candidate . In fact , he is nothing of the sort . Unlike the classic third-party candidates  --  say , Strom Thurmond and Henry Wallace , who in 1948 formed right- and left- wing offshoots of a real political party ( the Democrats )  --  Perot represents no party . He does not even pretend to . <P> Perot is a one-man band . The fact that one man alone could have had such a meteoric rise begs explanation . Yes , the country is disgusted with Washington gridlock . Yes , both parties have put up maddening mediocrities . Yes , America lionizes tycoons and is occasionally seized with the belief that they  --  Henry Ford , assorted Rockefellers , most recently Lee Iacocca  --  can save the country . And , yes , Perot has $100 million to blow . <P> But the Perot phenomenon signifies something larger , deeper . It signifies a geologic change in American politics : the growing obsolescence of the great institutions  --  the political parties , the Establishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the governors and the governed . The traditional way to achieve and wield power in America is to tame or charm or capture these institutions . Perot 's genius was to realize that for the first time in history , technology makes it possible to bypass them . Win or lose , knowing or not , Perot is the harbinger of a new era of direct democracy . <P> First Perot bypassed the parties . He has no use for them , except as foils for his own pristine independence . He deigned to enter not a single primary , and yet was hailed by exit polls as the winner of California 's . <P> As for the media , he realized that the proliferation of outlets has created a new game : a way to reach the American people directly , without the mediation of Dan Rather and the New York Times . The Perot campaign owed much of its amazing start to its call-in , soft-news-show launch , which allowed it to get its message out unfiltered . <P> And as for Congress , Perot promises to bypass it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electronic town hall "  --  Nightline with President Perot playing Ted Koppel . It is here , says Perot , that the American people will , in direct communion with the leader , solve those knotty problems that have eluded a clumsy , corrupt Congress . <P> Coming two-way TV technology will one day make it possible for Perot 's town hall to be more than a glorified national talk show . It could be a place where , as in the original New England town hall , people do n't just talk but vote . For bombing Baghdad , press 1 . For continued sanctions , press 2 . For punting until next week 's show , press 3 . <P> In 1789 the Founders contrived a deliberately cumbersome political system ( elected representatives , separated powers , bicameral legislature , indirect election of the President ) to make sure that popular passions were filtered before they could explode into national action . Over the next two centuries , party and press evolved as additional filters between rulers and ruled . Now , announces the Perot phenomenon , these filters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
