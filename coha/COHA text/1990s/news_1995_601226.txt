<p> Q : This day is a historic one . How will formal diplomatic relations change Vietnam ? <p> A : It 's a great day . If you remember , in 1945 President Ho Chi Minh sent at least eight messages to President Truman asking for recognition . But it 's 50 years later . For the last 10 years there have been a lot of days of headaches and frustration . But today is only one day . I know that in the future there is still a lot of work to do to get the two countries closer . <p> Q : The issue preventing full relations has been the MIAs . What will this action do to help us learn their fate ? <p> A : Since last year when the embargo was lifted , we in Vietnam are better off in resolving the MIA issue because we were able to go out to talk to farmers . We got a lot of documents , diaries , information from veterans who were not involved before . Also , it 's better for the Foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ archives . They actually formed teams to look in the archives , which have found related information to help . <p> Q : Are there groups in Vietnam opposed to the new ties ? <p> A : The legacy of the war has an impact in Vietnam . And we are working for a very delicate balance because memories of the war are still lingering on . If you want to overcome that , you have to do it step by step . You can not jump and say everything is OK . There are reluctant people here and in Vietnam , but the numbers are getting smaller and smaller . <p> Q : A concern raised by U.S. veterans is how poorly former South Vietnamese soldiers are treated . What is their status in society today ? <p> A : After the war , there was talk about a blood bath in Vietnam . But it was different , because in one family you might have two members fighting for the North and one member fighting for the South . It is a tragedy for us to persecute those in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So at the time we tried the re-education camps . By 1992 , all of them had been released . Many came to the U.S. We have a policy that we treat the soldiers of both sides equally . But , as here in the U.S. after the Civil War , it will take many years to reconcile the North and South . <p> Q : Many Vietnamese who came to the U.S. were from the South . Do you expect many to return now that ties with the U.S. have improved ? <p> A : There are about 1 million Vietnamese-Americans here now . The majority have been in support of normalizing relations . The younger generation , of about ages 20 to 30 , are very energetic , very successfully schooled . These people are very eager to go back to Vietnam , maybe not to stay there permanently but to work there and learn the language again by working for foreign companies . The generation that came here at about age 25 or 30 were still young and learned the language , joined the community and were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Q : And what about the oldest generation ? <p> A : Those who came here at age 50 or 60 could not learn the language . They could not integrate into society . They still have the hostile attitude toward the government at home . <p> Q : What will normalized relations between our countries mean to you economically ? <p> A : The economic relations between our two countries have been developed in the last year . The trade volume last year was about $ 215 million . This year it will be bigger . Already , there is $ 550 million in investment . The American Chamber of Commerce in Hanoi tracked about 90 members ; in Ho Chi Minh City ( formerly Saigon ) about 150 members . In total , the U.S. has about 300 to 400 companies that have direct relations with Vietnam . <p> Q : What types of U.S. companies would help Vietnam ? <p> A : On companies that want to work with Vietnam , you have Mobil , Exxon , Amoco , Texaco and many other oil companies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have construction and hotel development companies . You have three banks in Vietnam already . There are many projects under way with U.S. companies , like refineries and airports . Many of the power plants are being negotiated by U.S. companies like General Electric . <p> Q : You 've talked a lot about a market economy . Is communism dead ? <p> A : In Vietnam , communism is alive , but it must be in a way that is suited to our national cause . According to me , a communist works hard , is n't greedy , tries to help everyone , tries to develop a country , does n't take bribes , has a strong family . It 's how to develop Vietnam to be an independent and prosperous country . <p> Q : But many non-communists espouse those same ethics . Do you really have a communist state ? <p> A : Many teachings of the communists might not be suited for the new development . We can not say everyone will have the same property . You must accept that there are differences in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of market economy will be introduced . <p> Q : What do you think about having a possible U.S. military base at Cam-rahn Bay ? <p> A : We are very proud of the location of Vietnam . <p> Q : If you could convey a message to Americans who fought in Vietnam and to the U.S. families who lost relatives fighting in Vietnam , what would that message be ? <p> A : My message is let 's be friends . If we are friends , we can solve everything . If we are friends , we will overcome the legacy of the war quickly . If we are friends , I can help you solve your problems with the MIA issue and we can develop our relationship . Better to be friends than to be enemies and be hostile .
