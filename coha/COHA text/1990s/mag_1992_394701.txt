Summer is the time for taking things easy . People sit outside after dinner . It 's hard to put the kids to bed ; after all , who can sleep when it 's still light outside ? Though darkness seems to take forever , by 10 or 11 p.m. the stars are glittering overhead . You can stand outside without a jacket and gaze upward , drinking in the glorious sights of the summer sky with just your naked eye . From a very dark location in early June , you can see a glow just above and paralleling the eastern horizon . This is an edgewise view into our own Galaxy : the summer Milky Way . The starlit band of the Milky Way rises higher both as night passes and as summer progresses . It is a region rich in wonders , but let it wait a bit while you begin your evening exploration by looking to the west . At this time the western sky contains the last of winter 's stars . Golden Capella appears just above the northwestern horizon and will sink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sky , Capella does n't appear that bright because of the obscuring haze low in the sky . To its left are the bright stars Castor and Pollux , the starry eyes of the Twins in the constellation Gemini . Alphard , in the neck of Hydra , is doing a nose-dive in the west . As the minutes and hours tick by , Earth 's eastward spin on its axis will carry all of these objects out of view . Later this summer , Earth 's motion in orbit around the Sun will bring the Sun between us and them . Many of the constellations associated with spring have now crossed the " meridian "  --  the line that divides the sky in half from due north to due south . Look for Leo the Lion above Alphard in the west . It contains a recognizable pattern of stars , or " asterism , " in the shape of a backward question mark . This pattern is called the Sickle , and it now appears to be slicing down toward the western horizon . At the base of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the one that represents the lion 's heart . Regulus is a blue-white star that shines at magnitude 1.4 from a distance of about 90 light-years . Though Regulus is bright , it pales in comparison to the planet Jupiter , which happens to lie within the boundaries of Leo this year . The lion 's tail is represented by 2nd-magnitude Denebola , which is located above and slightly left of Regulus on the sky 's dome . This white star lies approximately 40 light-years away . You can imagine Regulus forming a large triangle with two other bright stars , both located 55deg to 60deg east of the lion 's heart . ( This is equivalent to three to four handspans . A handspan is the angular distance between the tips of your thumb and pinkie when you hold your outstretched hand at arm 's length . For most people , a handspan covers 15deg to 20deg . ) The lower of these two stars is Spica in the large constellation Virgo the Maiden . The higher star is Arcturus , in the constellation Bootes the Herdsman . Arcturus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it the fourth-brightest star in the sky . Spica is blue-white and shines more faintly than Arcturus , at magnitude 1.0 . At a distance of 280 light-years , Spica is quite far away to appear so bright . It is luminous and massive  --  a spendthrift due to run out of thermonuclear fuel in only about 50 million years . That 's in contrast to our Sun 's anticipated life-span of about 10 billion years . Halfway between Leo and Bootes lies Coma Berenices , or Berenice 's Hair . It 's harder to see than the constellations mentioned so far , but a conspicuous group of faint naked-eye stars makes it worth the effort if you have a dark sky . The direction to the north pole of our Galaxy lies within the borders of this constellation . Contrast this direction to the location of the hazy starlit band now ascending in the east and you can get a sense of the galactic plane in three dimensions . North of Coma Berenices and tucked under the handle of the Big Dipper lies Canes Venatici , the Hunting Dogs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought to be named for Charles II of England . On the other side of Bootes from Canes Venatici and nearly overhead on June evenings is Corona Borealis the Northern Crown . It 's easy to spot from a dark site , a compact grouping distinctly shaped like a semicircle . Its brightest star is Alphecca , which shines at magnitude 2.2 from an estimated distance of 75 light-years . As Earth spins beneath the sky , these springtime stars sink out of view below the western horizon . Meanwhile , the company of stars in the east ascends to dominate the summer night . By 11 p.m. in mid-June ( and earlier in July and August ) , three stars dominate the view to the east . These are Vega , the highest and brightest of the three , Deneb to Vega 's north , and Altair to Vega 's south . Known together as the Summer Triangle , they make convenient jumping-off points for many of the constellations of summer . High in the east and about one handspan above Vega on June evenings lies Hercules the Hero . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pattern in the center of the constellation that represents the body of the legendary strongman . Conveniently situated within the Keystone is a famous globular star cluster , thirteenth on a list of objects that could be mistaken for comets , compiled by the 18th-century French comet-hunter Charles Messier . M13 contains several hundred thousand of the Galaxy 's most ancient stars . This spherical collection of stars  --  which calls to mind a dandelion ready to lose its seeds  --  lies nearly 25,000 light-years away and spans more than 100 light-years . Shining at magnitude 5.9 , it is barely visible to the naked eye and easy to spot in binoculars . Look about one-third of the way from the star Eta ( eta ) to Zeta ( zeta ) in the Keystone ( see map on page 71 ) . ( Map omitted ) One star of particular interest lies south of the Keystone . Rasalgethi ( Alpha alpha Herculis ) is a slightly reddish , 3rd-magnitude star that represents Hercules ' head . ( The Hero appears upside-down , with his feet above his head , from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that of another sky-giant , Ophiuchus the Serpent-Bearer . Rasalhague ( Alpha Ophiuchi ) is Ophiuchus ' brightest star , a white , 2nd-magnitude star located about 5deg east of Rasalgethi ( about half the span of your clenched fist held at arm 's length ) . Ophiuchus looms large in the southeast on June evenings , but it 's not a bright pattern , so you 'll need a dark sky to appreciate it . Its name comes from two Greek words meaning " serpent " and " holding . " Not surprisingly , the Serpent-Bearer appears to be holding another constellation , Serpens the Serpent . The western part of the serpent 's body is the head , Serpens Caput . The eastern part is the tail , Serpens Cauda . The serpent 's tail is nearly lost in the rich summer Milky Way north of Scorpius the Scorpion . And that brings us to the Milky Way ! To fully appreciate the Milky Way , you need to get away from the lights of the city and choose a night when the Moon is not in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late evening and is a good place to start your Milky Way observations . Orange-red Antares is the brightest star in Scorpius . It lies far enough south that Northern Hemisphere observers never see it very high in the sky . The star represents the Scorpion 's heart . Antares belongs to an association of stars in the Scorpius area . Formed less than 20 million years ago from a single cloud of gas and dust , these stars were born massive and , like Spica , are squandering their fuel . Some of the other bright stars in Scorpius , including Beta ( beta ) and Delta ( delta ) Scorpii , also belong to this group . Of all the stars in this association , Antares alone has evolved to the red supergiant stage . Its enormous size is the reason it shines more brightly than the others , at magnitude 1.0 . Just west of Antares is another globular star cluster , designated M4 . You can spot M4 with the naked eye under ideal conditions and it 's easy to pick out with binoculars . The body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ southern horizon . You 'll find a beautiful star called Shaula , the " Stinger , " marking the end of the tail . As seen from the Northern Hemisphere , Shaula ( Lambda lambda Scorpii ) sparkles fiercely through the great masses of air near the southern horizon . It has a blue-white color and lies about 330 light-years away . Now raise your eyes a bit from Shaula . You 're looking into a dense , hazy region of the Milky Way , but in a reasonably dark sky you 'll easily see two distinct patches of light . These are the open star clusters M6 and M7 . Open clusters differ from globular clusters in that they congregate in the plane of the Galaxy and are located closer to us . Turn binoculars on these misty patches of light and watch them break up into remote clusters of glittering stars . At this point , if you want to sweep with your binoculars along the entire hazy band of the Milky Way , do so . The sight of so much " haze " turning into so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a bright , unmistakable asterism , this time in the constellation Sagittarius . It took me a long time to see a Teapot in this pattern , but most people see it easily . Three stars  --  Epsilon ( epsilon ) , Delta , and Gamma ( gamma ) Sagittarii  --  make up the Teapot 's spout . As you gaze at the asterism , imagine the hazy Milky Way as clouds of steam rising from the Teapot 's spout . Sagittarius marks the direction to the star-rich center of the Milky Way Galaxy . The exact center lies about 5deg northwest of Gamma , but some 30,000 light-years away . We ca n't peer directly into it , because it 's hidden from view by dust and a multitude of stars . When we look in this direction , we 're really seeing the next spiral arm of the Galaxy inward from where we are , called the Sagittarius Arm . Because we 're now looking toward the densest part of the Galaxy , there are many wonders in this part of the sky . Aim your binoculars about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lagoon Nebula , a bright compact star cluster surrounded by a cloud of gas and dust . This is an " emission nebula . " The hot , young stars here cause the cloud to glow . The word " lagoon " brings mystery to my mind , and this cluster looks very mysterious ! You can almost imagine paddling into it . just north of M8 is M20 , the Trifid Nebula . Binoculars show a patch of light ; a small telescope reveals the dark lanes that divide this cloud into three lobes . But do n't stop there . Scan back to the star that marks the lid of The Teapot , Lambda Sagittarii . Just northeast of there you 'll find another large globular cluster , M22 . Now set your binoculars aside . About halfway between Lambda Sagittarii and Altair in the Summer Triangle , notice a large luminous patch in the Milky Way . This is the Scutum Star Cloud , the main claim to fame of tiny Scutum the Shield . This particularly bright region of the Milky Way shines with the combined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Milky Way north from Scutum , you 'll next encounter Aquila the Eagle , the home constellation of Altair . This 1st-magnitude star is flanked on either side by fainter stars . The three , which form an asterism known as the Family of Aquila , appear to be marching arm-in-arm along the Milky Way . Moving farther north along the Milky Way you come to one of the smallest constellations . Delphinus the Dolphin is compact and , once you find it , easy to see . Look a bit northeast of Altair , along the eastern edge of the starlit trail of the Milky Way . Delphinus consists of four stars in the shape of a tiny diamond . A fifth star set apart from the others calls to mind a real dolphin 's leap above the waves . Twenty degrees ( one handspan ) northwest of Delphinus is a star that at first can appear inconspicuous in the midst of the Milky Way . It is Albireo , a wide double star in the constellation Cygnus the Swan . You can glimpse the duplicity of this star with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with one component blue and the other gold . Albireo becomes easy to see once you 've traced all of the constellation Cygnus . The constellation of the Swan contains a large asterism called the Northern Cross . In fact , the Cross and Swan are pretty much interchangeable in the minds of many stargazers . Albireo , at the base of the Cross , marks the Swan 's head . The crossbar marks the Swan 's wings . The head of the Cross and tail of the Swan are marked by Deneb , the second of our Summer Triangle stars . This whitish supergiant lies over 1,600 light-years away and shines at magnitude 1.3 , making it the most distant of all the bright stars . If it were as near as the Sun 's nearest neighbor , Alpha Centauri , which is only four light-years away from us , it would shine as brightly as the Full Moon ! The region around Deneb is wonderful for scanning with binoculars . Just 3deg east of the star is the famed North America Nebula ( NGC 7000 ) . With the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Star Cloud , located between Gamma Cygni ( the center of the Cross ) and Albireo . Here you are gazing at countless stars in the Sagittarius Arm of the Galaxy from a distance of about 7,000 light-years . Finally , look for the Great Rift in the Milky Way . The starlit trail seems to divide in Cygnus , but the dark lanes are really clouds of obscuring dust . Now we return to the brightest star in the summer sky , Vega . This brilliant white star shines at magnitude 0.03 and nearly overwhelms the other stars in its constellation , Lyra the Lyre . Still , you ca n't mistake Lyra 's compact pattern : a parallelogram attached to a triangle . Besides Vega , there is one other star in Lyra worth noting . Epsilon Lyrae  --  the outer star in the triangle pattern  --  is a quadruple star system . The primary pair can be " split " in binoculars , and each of these two stars turns out to be double when seen through a small telescope . Hence Epsilon Lyrae has the nickname of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on our tour of the summer sky . But do n't view it as the end of your exploration . Return to the sky often this summer . Get to know the bright stars and constellations well . Before many months pass , they 'll slide into the Sun 's glare to make way for stars of another season . But rest assured that these bright lights of summer will return on schedule next year . By that time , they 'll be old friends ! Deborah Byrd 's Eye on the Sky column appears every month in ASTRONOMY magazine . <p>                     @x Walk into must school libraries and you will see magazines and newspapers on a rack in cozy reading areas . Whether it is Scientific American in the high school or Cobblestone in the elementary school , periodicals are a mainstay of library collections . Although electronic databases have dramatically increased access to timely information and resources , budgets for both periodicals and subscription databases are often limited . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of web-based sources for timely information . <p> L : THE BASICS OF WEB FEEDS AND INFORMATION AGGREGATORS From webmasters and podcasters to bloggers and e-journalists , the Internet is overflowing with text , graphic , animation , audio , and video content that can be delivered to your desktop through web feeds and aggregators . <p> HOW DOES THIS WORK ? Many Internet information providers including news organizations , bloggers , and podcasters frequently update their content . Rather than asking readers to remember to visit their web site regularly , many webmasters are syndicating their content through a subscription system . The webmaster publishes a simple computer program known as a " feed " on their web site . The end user links to this feed through an aggregator program also known as a feed reader . This software checks for new content and helps the end user organize this flood of information . Unlike a traditional periodical that must be printed and mailed to each subscriber , a web-based feed reaches the end user almost instantly . Think of your aggregator as a virtual periodical collection . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeds from Reuters , USA Today , CNN , and BBC for older students and CBBC Newsround and PBS Newshour Extra for younger students . <p> HOW DO I KNOW IF A FEED IS AVAILABLE ? When you find a web site that is updated regularly , look for the web feed logo . The icon is generally an orange square containing a dot and 2 curved lines . <p> You might also see a rectangle with the letters RSS which stands for Real Simple Syndication or Rich Site Summary file format . In most cases you can simply drag the RSS link from your web browser into your aggregator . Or , you can copy and paste the RSS link . If you want more information , many web sites provide directions for using their RSS feeds . NASA RSS feeds &lt;http : //www.nasa.gov/rss/&gt; page contains information about linking to feeds for breaking news , image of the day , and many other information sources . <p> WHAT DO THE WEB FEEDS CONTAIN ? The information presented in a web feed varies depending on the content of the web site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a feed for short , breaking-news feeds , while a podcasting site would link to M audio files . <p> With young people , consider starting with simple , regular feeds such local news or weather feeds . Also try Weekly Reader Publishing Updates &lt;http : **31;14624;TOOLONG or Yahoo ! Education : Word of the Day &lt;http : **39;14657;TOOLONG . <p> HOW DO I CHOOSE AN AGGREGATOR ? You will need an aggregator to download , organize , and read your web feeds . <p> Web Browser . The easiest approach is to simply use your web browser . For instance , Firefox and Internet Explorer 7 have a built-in feed reader . When you go to a web site containing a feed , the web feed logo will appear in the menu bar known as a " live bookmark " . You can set up your feeds much like bookmarks . The problem with this approach is that it 's computer specific , so you 'd end up with different Feeds marked on each computer in your library unless you have a system For mirroring your hard drives . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so if you use iGoogle &lt;http : //www.google.com/ig&gt; or My Yahoo &lt;http : //my.yahoo.com/&gt; , you 've already got what you need . However if you want a tool designed specifically as an aggregator , consider Bloglines &lt;http : //www.bloglines.com/&gt; or Google Reader &lt;https : **28;14698;TOOLONG . This approach works well if you plan to share your feed reader with other teachers or students . Consider establishing a Bloglines account and linking it directly From your school library web site . <p> Desktop Readers . Many stand-alone feed readers such as FeedDemon &lt;http : //www.newsgator.com&gt; can be downloaded to your desktop . Different desktop readers are sometimes required or preferred for different operating systems , such as Newsfire &lt;http : **26;14728;TOOLONG for Macs . The main drawback of desktop madras for the school library is that the software must be installed on any computer using the reader . <p> Keep in mind that feeds can also be downloaded to multimedia programs such as iTunes for use on portable devices like an iPod . For example , a series of foreign language lessons downloaded as podcasts could be saved on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also provide audio feeds including news stories at Earth and Sky &lt;http : //www.earthsky.org/&gt; and children 's stories at StoryNory &lt;http : //storynory.com/&gt; . National Public Radio &lt;http : **26;14756;TOOLONG podcastdirectory.php&gt; also contains lots of audio that can be accessed with an RSS feed . <p> Once you 've chosen your reader , simply subscribe to the content that you want to receive . In a July 2006 article in School Library Journal , Will Richardson suggests that teacher-librarians proceed slowly . He states : " it 's pretty easy to load up on RSS feeds , only to find that you ca n't keep up with the resulting flood of content . " He suggests limiting subscriptions to 20 feeds or less until you get a Feel for the volume of content you can handle . <p> Consider starting with subscriptions to public library or school media center blogs . This is a great way to track what is happening in other libraries . For instance , the Seattle Public Library maintains a blog called Shelf Talk &lt;http : //shelftalk.spl.org/&gt; . <p> HOW DO I SELECT GOOD QUALITY FEEDS ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applies to virtual materials . In other words , you need to consider the timeliness , accuracy , authority , bias , and the other criteria used in evaluating other types of subscriptions . Remember that most web sites are designed for adults rather than young people . Think about reading level and age appropriateness . Also consider how the feeds align with curriculum standards . <p> WHY NOT JUST GO TO THE WEB SITE DIRECTLY ? Many people maintain bookmarks and pathfinders that contain links to content-rich web sites or use email for breaking news . Why bother with news aggregators ? First , you do n't need to wade through a web site to find the latest information , it 's sent to you directly . Second , files such as podcasts can be downloaded in the background to save time . Third , aggregators can notify you immediately of new content such as breaking news . Fourth , you do n't have to worry about giving out your email address . Fifth , if you no longer wish to receive the feed , you simply remove it from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggregator for your class rather than messing with individual access to bookmarks and email accounts . <p> Many school districts are concerned about student surfing and have filtered many of the blogs and other dynamic web sites . In most cases , the content of blocked web sites can still be accessed through RSS feeds allowing the school media specialist to select quality resources that might otherwise be unavailable to students . <p> HOW DO I PUBLISH MY OWN FEED ? If you already maintain a web site , a blog , or other web-based content such as podcasts , then consider making your content available through an RSS feed . If you are using one of the many blogging hosts such as Blogger &lt;http : /lwww.blogger.com/&gt; or eduBlogs.org &lt;http : //edublogs.org/&gt; , then an RSS feed is automatically generated , If you maintain your own web site , you need to add a simple XML file to your web site and let people know an RSS feed is available . <p> For example . the Cold Spring School Library blog &lt;http : **34;14784;TOOLONG and Kellogg Middle School Library &lt;http : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an RSS feed . <p> L : WEB FEEDS IN THE SCHOOL LIBRARY MEDIA CENTER According to Will Richardson ( 2006 ) , RSS is " one of the powerful new technologies that is allowing users to manage , create , and share online content as never before . " Keep in mind that young people of all ages can engage in learning experiences using RSS feeds , Cindy Newton of Eastview Elementary in Connersville , IN , set up an Indiana Mysteries blog &lt;http : **39;14851;TOOLONG for her elementary class to interact with children 's book authors and scientists . Students everywhere can trace their progress using the blog 's web feed . <p> READING AND WRITING IN THE INFORMATION AGE Students need experiences and tactical skills for optimal reading on the Internet ( Parry , 2006 ) . These include ways to find material worth reading and strategies to analyze the content . RSS feeds facilitate receiving chunks of information that are easy to scan and quickly select what they want to read . <p> Think about interdisciplinary approaches that might work with web content . For example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiction stories might look for parallels in today 's science news by subscribing to the Science News for Kids &lt;http : **44;14892;TOOLONG web feed . <p> Use current topics and articles in magazines such as Popular Mechanics &lt;http : **27;14938;TOOLONG rss/&gt; to promote non-fiction reading in areas such as robotics , science , industry , transportation , gardening , and woodworking . <p> As students use online resources in their written work , be sure they are properly citing sources . Consider a focused activity that asks students to apply information from a specific feed such as Science Daily &lt;http : **43;14967;TOOLONG and properly cite the source . <p> Provide children with virtual experiences that can be used in writing . For example , many bloggers track animal migrations or " journal " their work with endangered animals . Some classroom blogs like Duck Diaries &lt;http : **31;15012;TOOLONG and Trout Blog &lt;http : //mcdsblogs.org/ trout/&gt; Focus on local wildlife . Get students involved with reading and writing about these outdoor experiences . <p> WEB FEEDS IN THE CONTENT AREAS Look for ways to connect specific standards to online content . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events to present situations . Math standards require students to apply mathematical Formulas to authentic data sources . <p> The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration &lt;http : **37;15045;TOOLONG provides web Feeds for a wide range of climate and weather news and information . For instance , young people can track tsunami warnings , air quality , and coral bleaching from that site . <p> Consider some of the following ideas For using content-area web feeds in teaching and learning : <p> Catalyst . Use current issues to generate interest in a new topic . For example , use a news item on a recently identified deep ocean creature to engage students in a discussion of the possibility of life in extreme environments such as the polar-regions , deep sea , or outer space . Numerous science blogs , journals , and web sites such as the journals Nature &lt;http : **30;15084;TOOLONG and National Geographic News &lt;http : **43;15116;TOOLONG provide web feeds on the latest research . <p> Collaboration . Many web-based projects are using web feeds as a way to update participants on the progress of the their project . Participants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or other activity , then use the feed For quick access to the data . <p> The United States Geological Survey &lt;http : //www.usgs.gov/rss/&gt; provides podcasts and RSS feeds of its data including earthquakes and biological information . <p> Comparison . Students need experiences in comparing information sources . <p> For example , you might ask students to compare articles on the same topic from Why Files &lt;http : //whyfiles.org/&gt; , National Wildlife &lt;http : //www.nwf.org/about/ blogs.cfm&gt; , and other online magazines . Ask young people to compare the editorial cartoons in two different newspapers . The Daily New Yorker cartoon &lt;http : //interglacial.com **29;15161;TOOLONG is available as an RSS feed . Check other feeds at the Daryl Cagle web site &lt;http : **45;15192;TOOLONG . <p> Connection . Identify web feeds generated by professionals in specific disciplines to provide a real-world context for subject-matter content . Show students the enthusiasm of a mathematician or the hard work of an author . Many authors such as Laura Halse Anderson &lt;http : **36;15239;TOOLONG and Neil Gaiman &lt;http : **25;15277;TOOLONG maintain blogs that can be accessed through an RSS feed . <p> Critique . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work of art . Ask students to read a poem and discuss its message or judge the quality of a podcast . Try Arts and Letters Dally &lt;http : //www.aldaily.com/&gt; for ideas in literature and the humanities . <p> WEB FEEDS AND INFORMATION FLUENCY To become information fluent , today 's students must be able to apply their information skills to real-world situations . Web feeds provide authentic , timely information that students can analyze , critique , and discuss . Focus on assignments that involve students in web content evaluation . Ask students to compare the information found on different feeds . How is the same topic treated by different news sources ? Why is their coverage alike or different from each other ? <p> Also engage students in activities that involve analyzing content for facts , opinions , and arguments . Use web feeds from newspaper opinion sections and blogs for these types of activities . <p> Web feeds offer a variety of perspectives on timely topics . Use web feeds to compare points of view on topics in the news . <p> WEB FEEDS FOR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it for your own professional development . Activities such as browsing the latest book reviews or keeping up-to-date on the activities of professional organizations can be time consuming . Using an aggregator , you can quickly skim the latest news and information without having your email box clogged with messages . <p> Start with a few feeds in each category . Try adding a couple feeds for libraries with book reviews such as Menasha Library 's ( W1 ) , Kids Lit blog &lt;http : **33;15304;TOOLONG . Also , add links to professional association news such as the AASL blog &lt;http : **32;15339;TOOLONG and journals such as School Library Journal &lt;http : **31;15373;TOOLONG learnRss ? q=rss+feeds&gt; . <p> Spend some time searching your favorite web sites for their RSS feeds . For instance , EBSCO allows users to set up RSS feeds for their favorite database searches . <p> To see the web feeds discussed in this article and many more examples of RSS feeds across the curriculum , go to our example at Bloglines &lt;http : **40;15406;TOOLONG . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : FIGURE 1 <p> PHOTO ( COLOR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FIGURE 3 <p> L : REFERENCES  --  Parry , D.
