who are Black ? " When I wrote those woprds ten years ago , in ESSENCE 's first annual men 's issue , my wildest imaginings could not have projected the scenario that actually followed . Then I was full of hope ; my sons were caught in the throes of being , of " becoming . " They were grappling with their places in the world , their identities ( both racial and sexual ) , and two of them were at an age when their hormones raged as furiously as flooding rapids . I , like a great symphony conductor , was going to take these forces of man and nature and direct my sons harmoniously into " manhood . " How could I have known then that life does n't give a damn about the musings of a well-meaning father ? In ten brief years I have looked , if not upon chaos , at least upon a world swirling with unexpected change . Did I conduct the right song  --  but for the wrong time ? In a world where 1 million people carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had personal experience with the criminal justice system , were my parental admonitions , based as they were on another era 's idea of decorum , valid or meaningful ? In a world where women not only know their places but have also defined those places , were the Victorian assumptions that I proffered sufficient to bring my sons as whole persons into the changed new world ? I peer into the confusion of our lives and wonder . I see the glory of two grandchildren ( both from one son ) , but there is not even the shadow of a daughter-in-law . My son views the union I inquire about as a bane and so refrains from doing what in my day would have been considered " the right thing . " " But it is n't right to get unhappily married , " said Evelyn Brown , a social worker at Queens Hospital Center in New York City where I once worked . " First of all , many of our youngsters are simply not emotionally ready  --  they are still children , I do n't care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compound one mistake by making another . " But was n't there a reason we wanted young couples to abstain from sex or , if the girl was " caught , " to get married ? The small southern town in which I was raised did not consider it helpful or healthy to have children reared in a home headed by a single parent . Consequently , there were rituals , ancient rituals , of censure . These rituals were harsh and designed to shame us into the appropriate behavior . An unmarried pregnant teenager was considered " ruined . " She was banned from the regular public , put out of church , and her child was called a bastard . To avoid such " shame " and family embarrassment , it is no wonder that angry fathers demanded that young men do the right thing . Although we may think these measures are primitive , the question remains : How does a society or community indicate its displeasure when one has transgressed its standards ? My son eschews this ritual of the past , primarily because he does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ask , but I wonder about the needs of the young woman who is the mother of his children . In ten years we have moved to a time when the demands of the individual outweigh the requirements of the society . I am uncomfortable . My son , a sensitive and hardworking college student , vows to support his children . He will do so , I believe , and with more than just money , I hope . That economic cushion is needed , but as I said ten years ago  --  and still say  --  " The child is a chip off the old block , not because he was knocked off it but because he knocked around with it . " Boys need the examples of their fathers to follow . If you 're not married , it can be difficult to be that example , but it can be done . My son and others in his predicament must make that special effort . The times are too perilous not to . I see peril in the world and my sons think that I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not menace my children . " What about AIDS , " I ask . " Are n't you worried about that ? Do you know that last year the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta estimated that 1 million people are infected with the HIV virus ? " I say emphatically . " Furthermore , how can you roam the streets as late as you do without concern for your safety ? On the job I work at a hospital we have more than 40 gunshot wounds or knifings a week . It 's generally about drugs . You young people are killing yourselves . " They laugh at such talk . Wrapped as they are in the cocoon of suburbia , they diminish these global problems . They are aware of the relevant issues but do not see them as having any immediate significance in their lives . Their perspective begins  --  and ends , I think  --  with " I " or " me , " " we " or " us . " The perils I portend are for " they " or " them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but we would do that even if there were n't the scourge of AIDS . It has to do with what we 've learned in school and the schoolyard , I suspect of sex , disease and procreation . " ( I ignore that admission . They 'll really think I 'm crazy if I suggest the propriety of abstinence from sex until marriage . Judging from the songs they listen to on records and the radio , that is an idea whose time has gone . I am silent and thankful that they use condoms . ) Anyway , they argue , AIDS is the result of " messed up " social behavior and we " do n't indulge in that kind of behavior , so what 's the big deal ? " " And , Dad , " one exclaims , " we 're not the young men going around committing crimes or using drugs . We do n't even associate with those people . You 're acting just like white people . We 're young Black men , but that does n't mean that we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but pleased to see such strident individualism . It sorrows me , too . This individualism is good when it directs my sons away from a herd mentality . For example , when the film The Color Purple first opened , many people complained that there was not one positive Black man in the entire movie . I asked one of my sons if that was his impression . His response was quick . " Most of the men were dogs , but I did n't think they were talking about me or you in the film . I thought that 's the way those men were . " I was pleased to see his individuality expressed in this manner . However , I am cautioned that this same individuality can distort reality and see him ( and others like him ) as being apart from other Black people , from other struggling people . I listen to young Black men talk , and in their conversations I hear those derisive references to " them "  --  about the way " they " talk , the way " they " dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . Middle-class Black children have peeled themselves away from most of their kith and kin strictly along class lines . I , no doubt , make such distinctions . But I have an understanding of the circumstances that created these distinctions . I 'm not sure that those young people even care . I tell my sons that as Black people we are connected to the pain of the world , to the downtrodden , to the oppressed , to those people trying to liberate themselves from colonial masters . Our history has been their histories , and our salvation  --  indeed the world 's salvation  --  is tied to those people . They believe I am spewing platitudes . What could the United States ' outcasts , the Palestinians or the Sandinistas have to do with them ? As we sit in our library , wrapped in silken robes , I rave that we are outcast , too . They are confused ; the words do not fit the setting , so they leave me and go about their business . Estranged . Confounded . How can I make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world 's populations ? Yet they think of themselves as minorities . How can I get them to see that it is the whole world with which they are competing , not just this small part of it ? In seeking parity with white Americans , we may be surprised to attain it only to discover that we are in a second-class compartment on the world 's train of progress . I look at two men , 24 and 25 , and an 18-year-old teenager straining to be a man and wonder what I can tell them now . Already some of the messages of the past have failed . Or it appears that they have . In her novel Maude Martha , Gwendolyn Brooks describes her " first beau " as a " flourish " : If he had to choose between greatness and grandness , she says , he would choose the latter . So , too , would my sons : They are flourishes . It is my example that they follow . Flourishing , off I marched to the split-level dream in suburbia ( actually it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the good life . Lo and behold , I found it ! But I was far away from relatives , from friends , not to mention my barber and my wife 's beautician . Still something was amiss . This newfound Eden was so  --  let me not mince words  --  so white . To compensate for their trek to suburbia , to Eden , to whiteness , many Black people make special efforts to keep connected to their roots , their culture . We join Jack and Jill so that our children can meet other Black children . We seek out Black churches to hear the songs of Zion and find fellowship with people like those we have recently moved away from . It ai n't easy being Black , especially in Eden . You have to work at it . Ten years ago I wrote that I wanted my sons to " build or continue communal structures that will sustain their race from one generation to the next . " I wonder now , can that be done in Eden ? There is trouble in paradise . Noise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child , an 18-year-old boy , a man-child , menaced and manacled by policemen  --  all white . Arrested . I watch . Helpless . Effete . And all this for a traffic violation . I do the middle-class thing . I get a lawyer . Things will work out . I am angry with the police , and maybe even angrier with my son . His response is perhaps natural for an 18-year-old boy . Arrogant . Sure in the correctness of his actions . He has not yet learned to temper his feelings . I am angry because I know that his behavior can get him killed . He does n't believe me . A decade ago , I wrote : " The trick , of course , is to make them young Black men aware of danger without also making them afraid . " I failed to do that . Two of my sons are steeped in the rhetoric of their Blackness . Things are either Black or white . How ironic , I think . The children who have been the most " integrated , " who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ militant . Ten years ago I wanted them to be " Black . " Now I desire gray in their lives . The more things change , the more they remain the same . In November 1981 I could not have foreseen where we have come today . But I am for the most part pleased . I have raised three sons who passed through those years in good health , free of the scourge of drugs . They are honest , they are sensitive . For the next ten years I would have them revere the culture of their father and their father 's father , even unto Africa . I hope that they will not be satisfied with the comforts of their lives . The world is theirs  --  not the Black world , not America , but the world . It is for them , in the words of poet Margaret Walker , " To rise and take control . " That is why we moved to Eden , to give them the best opportunities to compete . That is why we urge them to get the appropriate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be eagles , they will not stand rooted to the earth like fence posts . In the past ten years , the next ten years and for decades into eternity , I gave and give to you , my sons , love . This I hope will help you to live in this world as whole persons , caring about others . It is your obligation to change the world in which you live . Harriet Tubman did it . Marcus Garvey did it . Malcolm X did it . You can do it , too . It 's in your blood . Phil W. Petrie is a freelance writer who lives in New Jersey . <p>
