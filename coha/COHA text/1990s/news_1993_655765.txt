<p> SEVERAL sleek skyscrapers that have cropped up in Atlanta over the last few years look poised to blast off into space : The pointed tops of the buildings resemble the tips of rockets glinting in the sun , reaching toward the heavens . <p> These gleaming structures are metaphors for this capital city - the economic engine of the South . Atlanta seems to be on an endless quest to propel itself into the future as one of the world 's great metropolises . <p> Part of the impetus to forge ahead is the 1996 Summer Olympic Games , a prize event the city captured in 1990 . For three weeks , the eyes of the world will be on Atlanta . And Atlanta wants to keep that gaze focused on itself and become known as an international city , a status it has been struggling to achieve since the 1970s . <p> " On the circuit to win the bid , people would say to me : ' I know about the city . I 've heard about Atlantic City , ' " laughs Atlanta Mayor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Atlanta is known . " <p> During a five-minute interview in the sparkling new marble and glass-enclosed city hall , Mayor Jackson lists some of the efforts to push Atlanta into the global arena . " We 're building 24 new international gates at Hartsfield Airport , " he says . " We 're doing a lot with trade ; we 're among the most successful states at attracting foreign investment . " <p> Though the leap into the international ranks has yet to be realized , Atlanta is growing significantly from a national perspective . The metropolitan area of 2.8 million leads the United States in construction of single family housing and added 37,000 new jobs in 1992 . <p> Small businesses in computer software and health technology have helped fuel the growth , and Atlanta is the No. 3 telecommunications center in the US , says Donald Ratajczak , director of the Economic Forecasting Center at Georgia State University here . In 1991 , Fortune Magazine named Atlanta as the top city for business . <p> " Idaho , Utah , Nevada are growing faster than we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ratajczak says . <p> As a result of the growth over the last few decades , more than 75 percent of the people who live here are not native Atlantans but have been flocking - mainly to the suburbs - from the South , Midwest , and other regions of the US . <p> " I 'm from New Jersey where everything is closed in . Here it 's wide open , " says Jackie Drummond , sitting on a bench near a busy downtown intersection with her children , Jasmine and Jihad . " Atlanta is steadily growing , and there are so many opportunities here . " <p> The idea of Atlanta as a hub of growth is echoed in conversations with city officials , business people , educators , and others who ca n't seem to promote the city enough . Boosterism has been a fact of life here since General Sherman 's Union forces burned Atlanta in 1864 . <p> " You always have the huckster image of the South , " Ratajczak says . " What 's wrong with that ? If you have the product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you do n't have the product , you wo n't be able to carry it off too long anyway . " <p> But for many , Atlanta is not a land of opportunity . Not far from the city 's glittering high-rises are areas ravaged by crime , drugs , and poverty . Violent crime increased by nearly 300 percent over the last five years , and an estimated 12,000 to 15,000 people are homeless . The city ranked ninth poorest in the US in 1990 , according to the US Census Bureau . One of Atlanta 's residents , former president Jimmy Carter , is attempting to tackle these and other urban problems through the Atlanta Project , which channels thousands of volunteers and talent from the community to help the inner city . <p> In the basement of a community center next to St. Luke 's Episcopal Church , Brian Allen and Charles Harris are huddled over a computer . They are working with the Atlanta Project on a plan to help the homeless by providing them with a center , open 24 hours a day , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and utilize other services . <p> " We 're trying to get homeless people to get back up and help themselves , " says Mr. Allen , who has been in and out of homelessness and currently lives in a building about to be boarded up . He predicts that the number of homeless will have soared further by the Olympics " unless we can come up with a plan to house people and get them off the street . " <p> When the conversation turns to Atlanta 's pros and cons , Mr. Harris , a Louisiana native who made circuit boards for the military until he lost his job and spent three months being homeless last year , says , " I love it . There are a variety of activities , employment opportunities ... but Atlanta is too money hungry . If they ca n't make a dollar off something , they do n't want it . " <p> The city 's eagerness to make a buck has drawn criticism from some city council members , who question how ethical some strategies are . Last year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to raise millions of dollars for the city by renaming streets and parks for corporate sponsors . As part of this plan , Visa USA in January became the " official credit card of Atlanta " and will pay the city $ 3 million over the next five years . <p> " I think it 's kind of silly , " says Dana White , a history professor at Atlanta 's Emory University , " but I 'm to a point where nothing surprises me . " <p> Dr. White , an expert on Southern cities and cultures , helped write and host an eight-part series that aired on Atlanta 's public television station , called " The Making of Modern Atlanta " ( four installments ran in 1991 and four in March 1993 ) . He says Atlanta , unlike a number of other US cities that have distinct ethnic enclaves or neighborhoods , basically has had only two groups that have shaped life here : blacks and whites . <p> It 's known that blacks , who account for about 69 percent of the city 's population , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlanta is " black-operated but not black-owned , " Harris says . " It 's like I run the house , but you own it . It 's a robotic city . " <p> Still , the city is proud that it never suffered the race riots of the 1960s . Mayor Jackson boasts : " We 've never claimed to have perfect race relations , but we have the best race relations of any city . " <p> Atlanta also has probably the fastest-growing black middle class of any metropolitan area in the country , White says , explaining that two black middle classes exist in Atlanta . One group , though living in the suburbs , still maintains ties to established downtown churches . The other group , many of whom are corporate transferees , have virtually no connection with black Atlanta and live in black enclaves farther out in the suburbs . <p> Home to the Carter Center ; the Martin Luther King , Jr . Center for Nonviolent Social Change , Inc. ; Cable News Network ; the " Underground " shopping area ; professional sports such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basketball , and Knights hockey ; and large corporations like Coca-Cola , Atlanta faces several challenges , White says . These include revitalizing downtown so the city is a place that attracts people at night as well as during the day and integrating the disadvantaged into a prosperous metropolitan center . <p> " After the euphoria of the Olympics announcement , the city went into sort of a decline in confidence , which I think is still going on , " White says . " We 've just gone through several months of questioning whether they would build an Olympic stadium ... It 's taking a lot of time to get things done , and Atlanta has always prided itself on getting things done right away . It 's not working out that smoothly .
