It was already 8:30 a.m. on election day , and the one-room , dirt-floor polling station in San Miguel de Ocosingo , deep in the rebel territory of Chiapas state , should have opened half an hour ago . But ballot boxes had not arrived . The door stayed closed , and the line of expectant voters outside grew longer . Was this another case of ballot hijacking by the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party , the P.R.I. ? Finally , Caralampio Amparo Perez , an election official , emerged waving one of his replacement boxes over his head . He had improvised with cookie cartons ; each had a hole cut into the side and covered with a plastic bag to create a makeshift window . The voters nodded , and by day 's end they and the country had elected Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon Mexico 's next President . <P> The true test of the elections was not who the winner would be  --  Zedillo had been leading in most opinion polls since July  --  but whether voters would believe that he had won fairly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its ! most notorious achievements was its skill at arranging not to lose .

Many experts had been predicting that Zedillo , the unassuming technocrat plucked from obscurity after the party 's first choice was assassinated in March , would win with less than half the votes and that the restive electorate would send large numbers of opposition members to Congress . The voters disproved those forecasts and gave the P.R.I . sizable majorities in both houses of Congress . <P> The most impressive number of all was that 77% of registered voters turned out . When the leftist Democratic Revolutionary Party ( P.R.D. ) put up a strong challenge for the presidency in 1988 , only 48% of the electorate went to the polls . This time , say analysts , voters truly believed that their choice would count .
