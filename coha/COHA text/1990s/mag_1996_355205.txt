CAN HE MAKE PEACE ? <P> " When it comes to dealing with Israel 's neighbors , better a hawk ( Netanyahu ) in sheep 's clothing than a sheep ( Peres ) in hawk 's clothing . " JOSEPH MINKOWITZ Toronto <P> " Can He Make Peace ? " appears to be a cynical question with regard to the election of Benjamin Netanyahu WORLD , June 10 . It is better to revisit the elections of Israeli Prime Ministers like Menachem Begin and Yitzhak Shamir and U.S. Presidents like Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan . Against heavy odds , they all surprised the world by opening up new avenues to peace despite their political-campaign rhetoric . Even Yasser Arafat proved that one can work toward peace under proper circumstances and receive a Nobel Peace Prize . Instead of being sarcastic about it , let us congratulate the people of Israel who elected Netanyahu , a young , energetic , intelligent sound-bite master , politically seasoned ( in the American way ) . VALIYAVEETIL T. SAMUEL Grambling , Louisiana <P> It is most unfortunate that so many leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have fallen , either to ballots or to bullets . Shimon Peres was not a consummate politician , but then a consummate politician would not have risked everything for his cause . What Peres has proved himself to be is a decent human being  --  and a true visionary . What greater honor could be bestowed upon him than for the U.N . to name him as its next Secretary-General ? No diplomat on the world stage has been so dedicated to the cause of peace and so tireless in pursuing the U.N . ' s primary goal : the end of conflicts worldwide . BOB ADAMS Dania , Florida <P> Your cover story , " the right way to Peace ? , " blithely suppresses the security concerns that motivated many Israelis to vote for Netanyahu when it says , " At issue was not peace vs. security . " Peres , unlike Yitzhak Rabin or " Bibi " Netanyahu , lacked the military credentials that are essential for a leader in a country where every citizen serves in the army and may be called upon at any moment to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of " hope vs. fear , " without addressing the candidates ' military backgrounds , was to miss a crucial dimension of the election . At its heart , the question was about whom Israelis trusted more as a leader in a place where war is not an abstract concept but an everyday reality . Peres , lacking the proper military bona fides , said , " Follow me " ; the Israeli electorate said no . JEFFREY KAHANA Cambridge , Massachusetts <P> Israelis have ditched Peres gold for Bibi tinsel . Netanyahu 's success in the scheme of things will be no less than miraculous , his failure a sure victory for political sanity . MAHMOOD FARIDOON Farsta , Sweden <P> Your correspondents in Israel paint a picture of the Israeli right as warmongers , anxiously awaiting battle with the Arab residents of Israel . I voted for Netanyahu . As the mother of five sons , I have no desire to pursue war with anyone . Netanyahu was elected because Shimon Peres too easily forgot Arafat 's history as a murderer . We are hoping Netanyahu will remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rigid guideline of negotiation . Arafat and his followers should recognize that Israel can not be divided into any more pieces .
