The baby was born on a Tuesday night at the end of July , its mouth rimmed with a tarry green-black crust that had a sweet , pungent odor . " Now what do I do ? " said the obstetrician . <p> " Bring her on up to Mom . " The nurse stretched out her arms to receive the baby . " Cute little fella , " she said . She laid the baby on the mother 's chest . <p> Are you a boy or a girl , the mother wondered . " Hello , " she said . <p> The baby 's chest rose and fell in a rattle of inhalations . Its back left a soft green crud on the mother 's breast . The nurse reached across and tapped the baby . <p> " Come on , baby , " she said . " Breathe for your mother . " <p> " Hi , honey , " the father said . An hour before he 'd taken a long look as the baby 's head had begun to crown , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was a girl . He confirmed this as the nurse tapped the baby 's chest again . He could not help but feel a little disappointed . He had wanted to name the baby after his father 's father , because he did not respect his father and his father knew this , and he wanted to show his father that he loved him . He had imagined his father 's teary voice on the other end of the line after he said , " It 's a boy . We 're naming him Jacob . " <p> " We 're going to have to take the baby , " the nurse said . She pulled the baby back to her . <p> The father looked at the mother to see what he should do . <p> " Go with her , " the mother said . <p> " I 'll be right back , " the father said . <p> " She 's a little dusky , " the nurse said . <p> He followed the nurse from the delivery room , the baby breathing a gravelly pant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank of monitors suspended from the ceiling , men and women in scrubs standing under it , like passengers checking flight departure times . <p> " I could use a little help here , " the nurse called . <p> She carried the baby into a dark room , the father close behind her . <p> " Could you get the light switch , " she said . <p> In the dark the glass walls were opaque and tubes hung out of machinery . He felt frantically for a switch . When he flicked it on she lay the baby on a cold metal table . The baby rasped and wriggled . " Come on , baby , " the nurse said . She tapped the baby 's chest . The baby choked and coughed . She had narrow little legs and a proud yellow chest . Her face appeared blue . " Come on , baby , " the nurse coaxed , reaching to her right for a forked tube , which she bit at and stuck one end of in the baby 's mouth . Out a third end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and greenish black matter began to fill the bag . <p> " Meconium , " someone said . <p> A few people in scrubs had wandered in . The father knew what meconium was  --  in the opening of his life that was the onset of parenthood he 'd heard any number of birth stories from new parents  --  Caesarean , vacuum , forceps  --  meconium was n't a problem . During a trauma in labor , a moment he thought he could now clearly pinpoint , the baby had inhaled part of her first bowel movement . He drifted back as the medical people filled in the remaining space between him and the baby . The clear bag bloated with the meconium . <p> " You go on back to your wife , " a man with a beard said . " We 'll bring her to you . " <p> A balloon-shaped bag hovered over the baby 's mouth and the nurse drew the tube out as someone with a braceleted wrist handpumped air into the baby . Her chest rose and fell . <p> " You go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She 'll be fine . " <p> " He can come back in a few minutes to cut the cord , " the nurse working on the baby said over her shoulder . The father looked at her . " If you want . " <p> " Sure , " he said . <p> She turned back to reinsert the tube into the baby 's mouth . <p> In the cramped delivery room his wife was examining her placenta , while the obstetrician , with the assistance of another woman , stitched the episiotomy . The placenta sat in a beige plastic tub on a metal cart . Through its red bulb he could see pockets of the green-black tar . <p> " How is he ? " the mother said . <p> " She 's a girl , " the father said . <p> " A girl ? " the mother said . " I thought someone called her fella . " <p> " They 're working on her , " he said . " She aspirated meconium . " He gave an involuntary smile at the plucking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Jon 's baby had , " the mother said . " It took ten minutes . " <p> " They said they 'd bring her back , " the father said . <p> " That hurts , " the mother told the two women stitching her . <p> " Really ? " the newly arrived woman said . <p> " Yes , " the mother said . <p> " Where I was last , " the obstetrician said , pointing at the mother 's vagina , " we used to do a loop there . " <p> The bearded man in scrubs came in and looked at the two obstetricians working , then at the wife , then at the husband . <p> " Your baby , " he said . " They 'll bring her back to you on her way to intensive care . " He started to leave . " You still want to cut the cord ? " <p> " Intensive care ? " the mother said . <p> " Just for a little while . A couple hours , maybe a day . She should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hand and accompanied the man with the beard back to the glass room . The little girl lay on a white bath blanket with a tube running out her mouth , her round face yellow and her eyes open but inert . The father was given a pair of scissors and he cut the cord . The baby was screaming but she did n't seem to have any voice . He reached through the people in scrubs and touched her chest . The nurse smiled back to him . " We 'll bring her in to Mom in a second . " <p> In the delivery room his wife lay dazed and unattended on stained sheets , the placenta in its tub on the floor . <p> " They 're bringing her back , " the father said . <p> " I 'm hungry , " the mother said , her left hand still hooked to an IV . She studied the IV and he bent to look at the placenta . " You want to make the phone calls . " <p> He shrugged . It seemed a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What should I say ? " he said . She told him . " I 'll be right back , " he said . <p> He hurried out to the waiting area . In the new wing , uninhabited for another month , a pay phone had been planted into a wall of unpainted sheetrock . As agreed , he called her mother first , then her father , then his parents . He heard his voice say that the doctors said everything would be fine , that the baby was having difficulty breathing , that it was just meconium . The grandparents expressed elation . Plane tickets were already being bought . He saw fragments of his face in the mirrored metal of the wall unit . He nodded at himself as he listened to the sugary voices . An inexplicable hatred for all the grandparents came to him and settled in him . " Way to go , tiger , " his father said . <p> Twenty minutes had passed . His wife still lay in bed . " Did they bring her by ? " he asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right ? " <p> " I 'll go check on the baby , " he said . <p> Out the other door , through the way station filled with medical staff halfheartedly eyeing the monitors , he found the glassed-in triage room empty . He turned to interrupt one of the staff . She looked at him indifferently . <p> " The baby who was in there . " He pointed at the lit windows . <p> She shrugged . " There 's a clerk out by the waiting area who can help you . " <p> He exited yet another door and followed a bright hallway to where he recalled the intensive care nursery being , from the expectant parents ' tour the month before . He stood in a narrow antechamber as a new group of medical personnel maneuvered around a warming bed that he surmised held his child . A woman saw him and touched the crossed heavy arms of a large man with a silver beard and a yellow gauze gown . <p> " The father 's here , " she said , loud enough for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and smiled at the father . " Come on in , " he said . " Put on a gown . " <p> The father pulled a disposable yellow gown from a wall dispenser and thrust it on . A sign said to wash his hands for one whole minute , and he made himself do this as well . He stepped into the nursery and stood by the doctor in the matching gown . <p> " You have a very sick baby , " the doctor said . <p> The father nodded . Through the tangle of tubes and arms he caught sight of her . Machinery gonged and beeped above her , and her mouth was pried open by a blue respirator tube . Her arms lay loose at her sides and her eyes were glazed under heavy lids . A white tube sprang from her umbilicus . She had IV 's attached to a hand and a foot . From her forehead a toy-sized syringe projected . A diaper lay open under her bottom , making way for a catheter tat fed a tiny plastic bag . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stabilize her , " the doctor said . <p> " Why do n't you come back in an hour or so with your wife . I 'm sure she 'd like to see the baby . " <p> " What happened ? " the father said . <p> The doctor recrossed his arms and leaned against a sink . " She inhaled too much meconium and it 's settled so deeply in her lungs she ca n't process oxygen and we ca n't suction it out . It 's a situation that will have to resolve itself . " <p> " What are you saying ? " the father said . <p> The doctor sighed and scowled and smiled . " We 'll have to wait and see , " he said . " Like I said , you have a very sick baby . " <p> The father looked past the medical people at his little girl . He was reluctant to leave her to them , but he had to tell his wife . What would he tell her ? He glanced sideways at the doctor in his yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his belly . A woman in blue demanded , " What 's her pH ? " and glared at a guy in green scrubs while he fumbled for an answer . The baby quivered under a bright yellow light aimed at her belly . The father wished he could close the diaper for her . He counted five people around the baby , plus the doctor . He wondered if the baby was warm enough . Labor had lasted nineteen hours and he was cold and knew he should be hungry , but he had no appetite . He followed the hallway back toward his wife 's room , half expecting to find her gone . <p> She sat in bed , eating meat loaf from a styrofoam plate . She looked up at him ; she was making herself eat . The sheet under her was a dark circle of blood . <p> " She 's in the ICN , " he tried to say evenly . " The doctor said we have a very sick baby , " <p> She put her hand to her mouth and made herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nodded , and opened them . She pointed to a red carton of juice on her tray . <p> " I saved this for you , " she said . " Is she going to die ? " <p> " I do n't know , " he said . <p> " Did you ask ? " <p> " He said we have a very sick baby . " He took up the carton and forced it open , took a sip of the juice . <p> " I need to pee , " she said . <p> He came around the other side of the bed , to where the IV hung from a metal pole . She held on to him and he pulled the pole along on its wheeled stand as they made the difficult walk across the room to the bathroom . She sat gingerly on the seat and looked up at him . Small blood vessels had popped under her eyes from the pressure of pushing the baby out . <p> " I ca n't , " she said . <p> " Try , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Should I close the door ? " he said . She shook her head . The faintest line of water sounded from the bowl beneath her . Her face flushed . He touched her hand , careful not to disturb the IV . After the sound ceased she wiped herself and he helped her from the seat . There was blood in the bowl and blood on the back of her gown and blood dripped in drops onto the bathroom floor . <p> " I 'd like to put on some underwear , " she said . <p> He nodded and went to the packed bag with the teddy bear and the new nightgown that opened down the front so that she could breastfeed , and he found a pair of fresh underwear while she leaned against the bathroom doorframe . <p> She looked at the small , white underwear . " I guess not , " she said . <p> He helped her back to the bed and she leaned carefully against it and eased herself onto the dark stain of blood that marked where she should sit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> He 'd been getting cups of ice all day . In the waiting area , a pregnant woman sat on a wooden chair waiting to be admitted . She clutched a string of beads  --  a rosary , he guessed  --  and muttered words , her eyes shut . The ice machine was clogged with ice that had partially melted and then refrozen , and he took a metal fork and poked at its mouth and gouged and slashed until the ice fell free . He held a cup to it , pressed the button , and ice overflowed onto the floor . The hallway was empty . He took the full cup and stepped over the tricky cubes of ice back down the hall . <p> She was not in the delivery room . A wheelchair which had sat waiting in a corner was gone . He hurried out the corridor to the ICN . As he approached he could see the back of her in the chair wheeled up close to the warming bed . Her cotton gown fell slightly open at the back , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The yellow gauze of the required gown was looped around her neck . The nurse who 'd brought her down stood waiting to take her back . He came right up beside his wife , not bothering with the gown or a hand wash , and the nurse retreated . His wife moved her left hand , the one with the IV still in it , up and across her chest until it rested on his hand as it curled around the top of the wheelchair . The baby lay just out of reach on the warming bed with her diaper thrown open , her eyes nearly shut , her face puffed and swollen , and stale pinpricks of blood flecked on her skin where the tubes and lines had been inserted . Someone from X-ray was due to take a picture of her lungs and the second blood gases were expected in ten minutes . <p> " You should get some rest , " the doctor said to the mother . <p> " Yes , " the mother said . She bent her head and looked at her lap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sterilized gauze of the ICN gown , then looked up at the baby again . White adhesive strips were taped tightly around her mouth to keep the respirator tube in place . " Could she die ? " the mother said . <p> " What ? " the doctor said . The father thought he could sense the various men and women around the bed pause in their ministrations , listening with a defensive professional instinct . <p> " I said , ' Could she die ? ' " the mother said . <p> The doctor readjusted himself against the sink , his folded arms resting in a fresh position on his belly . " Yes , " he said . <p> They made the phone call to her mother at one-thirty her time . The husband made it because the wife was afraid she would n't be able to say what needed to be said . She was now free of her IV and she sat in the wheelchair by him in the starkly lit unpainted new wing while he punched in all the numbers and the phone rang twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He carefully explained to her mother all that he knew and when the mother interrupted to ask if the baby could die , he gave the same simple one-word answer the doctor had given and her mother let out a sharp intake of breath as if she 'd been struck and her voice for the next few seconds was only a whimper . He waited a moment and then told her why they needed her help and what perhaps she could do for them and through the phone line he could feel her nodding yes , yes . She would make phone calls to her colleagues in the pharmaceutical industry , wake people , to find out possible prognoses and treatments . She referred to the baby as " Our baby " and he was nervous . She took notes , posed pointed questions , and hung up without remembering to ask to speak to her daughter . <p> " She 'll call around , " he said to his wife . <p> They took the elevator to the fifth floor , where from their Lamaze classes they knew was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A janitor stood at the other end , working a mop and bucket , carefully ignoring them . They bought shrinkwrapped food  --  a burrito for him that he had to microwave , a ham and cheese sandwich for her  --  and took it to a large empty waiting room that serviced the geriatrics unit . They sat side by side against a long wall and ate . There was a television which the husband wanted to turn on to get some noise in the room . There were a pile of magazines and an empty flower pot . <p> " We should get back , " she said . She stood up and threw away the remainder of her sandwich . He helped her from the room , holding her elbow gently . The elevator was waiting for them . <p> Outside the ICN they washed and gowned themselves , only to be told by a nurse that it was change of shift and they 'd have to come back after midnight . They could barely see the baby on her warming bed , her head resting to one side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . <p> His wife now had a bed on the maternity ward , across the hall from labor and delivery . It was a three-bed room , the beds planted at crazy angles to one another to accommodate the dividing curtains . He set up his wife with a sitz bath in the narrow bathroom . Through the curtains he could hear a nurse scolding one of the new mothers . " You have to change him , " she said . " It 's your responsibility . " The walls of the bathroom were green and when the door opened and his wife came out from her sitz bath and maneuvered herself into bed , her section of the room was washed with a greenish light . He tucked her in and asked if she wanted her teddy bear . She shook her head no . <p> He was not allowed to stay in any of the parents ' rooms because they had all been previously booked , and he was not allowed to stay in his wife 's room . He found a small waiting room across from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blanket from his wife 's bag . The room was airless and dark and cold , and he did not think he could sleep . <p> He woke to the feeling of someone recovering him with the blanket . <p> " Is that you ? " he said . " What time is it ? " <p> " A quarter to four . " <p> He made himself get up into the cold room . He walked out into the hallway with her . There were still skins of little puddles where he 'd dropped the ice . As they hurried along the corridor to the ICN he asked her if she 'd heard anything . " Nothing , " she said . <p> Their baby 's side of the nursery was well-lit . In an enclosed room off to the right a woman in blue scrubs bent over a spiral notebook with a four-color pen . She looked up , nodded at the parents , and scrawled on a ruled line . They washed their hands for one minute and pulled on the sterile yellow gowns . He put his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby . They stood by the side of the bed . Her belly was puffed up and her chest fluttered in regular wingbeats as the respirator fed her air . A dark ring of crusted blood had formed around the white tube at her umbilicus . Her cheeks pursed against the white adhesive tape and dried perspiration left a film around her eyes and on her forehead . At two of the IV insertions , one at the foot and one on the hand , little bulbs of orange light had been attached in an almost ornamental fashion . <p> " You can touch her , " someone said behind them . " And talk to her , too . She 'll recognize your voices . " <p> It was the doctor , leaning against his sink . <p> The mother reached out and stroked an unmarred length of the baby 's arm . When she was finished , the father felt along the soft skin , patches flaking with a layer of birth fluid . <p> " You 're the only ones who touch her who wo n't hurt her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us touches her , " he smiled apologetically , " it 's to start an IV or suction the breathing tube . " <p> The mother bent down to the baby . " Hi , sweetie , " she said . <p> " How is she doing ? " the father said . <p> " The pictures were not good . " The doctor looked at both of them as the mother turned from the baby . " But she 's shown great resiliency . Her heart is normal . She 's urinating , which means her kidneys are in order . " He pointed at the respirator settings . " You can see for yourself she needs a hundred percent oxygen , eighty breaths a minute . She 's not processing it that well . We 'll have to wait and see . " <p> " She 's not stable ? " the mother said . <p> " She 's critical , " the doctor said . <p> " How many cases of this do you see a year ? " the father said . <p> The doctor shrugged . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens next ? " the mother said . <p> " We 'll have to see . " <p> The father touched his daughter 's arm , gently scraped away some of the flaking . An alarm gonged . The father was horrified . The woman in blue scrubs came out from her office and shut the sound off , looked around at the father and the mother and the doctor . " I do n't think you should touch the baby , " she said . <p> " They can touch the baby , " the doctor said . <p> She pulled up a high cushioned chair on wheels and sat next to the bed with her notebook . <p> " Where were we ? " the doctor said . <p> The father was torn between wanting to be with the baby as closely as he could , to let her know he was there , and wanting to listen to the doctor . The mother lay a pinky in the baby 's hand and the baby squeezed it , her face grimacing around the white tape . Another alarm beeped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and clicked it off . <p> " Do you have any family here ? " the doctor said to the parents . <p> " No , " the mother said . " They 're all on the East Coast . " <p> " They 'll be coming out , " the father added quickly . <p> " Good , " the doctor said . He started to leave , then tapped the white index card on the side of the warming bed that said BABY GIRL KEENAN . " Let us know when you name her , " he said . <p> When he was gone the woman in scrubs looked up from her book . " I did n't mean to be rude , " she said . " It 's just better for the baby if she rests as quietly as possible . " She got up and retreated to the little office behind the glass windows . <p> They stood by the baby . In the mother 's bag in her room was a list of a half-dozen boys ' and girls ' names , but they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the boy , Emery for the girl , after the mother 's grandfather . The girl lay there in sleep with her knees at a slightly jaunty angle , as if perhaps she could push herself up and run off . The father did n't want to name her just yet . To name her would be to somehow condemn her . He felt superstitious , just as he 'd been about calling the grandparents . He felt it was better to wait until everything was in the state it ought to be . He could feel the pressure of his wife beside him , wanting to name her , wanting to welcome her into the world , wanting to say you are one of us and you have a name . He did n't want a particular name attached to this moment in her life , fixing her in it . He wanted to wait . He needed to wait . Did n't he have any faith in her ? He touched her wrist . " We name you Emery Keenan Brooks , " he said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a second doctor assigned to the ICN . He was younger than the first , in his late thirties or early forties , with thin black hair and hornrimmed glasses , and he assured the mother and the father that the situation was not so bleak . " She 's not on Pavulon , for one thing , " he pointed out . " And we have n't had to hook her up to dopamine yet . Beyond that , there 's always the lung bypass machine . Am I going too fast ? " <p> The father and mother shook their heads . The doctor had already sketched a diagram showing how the lungs refused to process oxygen and how the baby had reverted to a type of breathing that she 'd been doing in the womb  --  persistent fetal circulation . Very rare , and in the first four days of life , " very difficult , " the doctor said . And the father had spent a half hour on the phone with a doctor at his mother-in-law 's pharmaceutical firm , a man who had been woken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he lived for that kind of phone call and had spent the next nine hours reading up on the baby 's illness and consulting colleagues in and out of the firm . " The doctor on your case , " the pharmaceutical doctor had said , " is a top guy . " Now the father would have to ask about this new doctor . <p> A woman popped her head into the doorway . " When you 're done with these two , " she said with a Caribbean accent , pointing at the mother and father , " I need to talk to them . I 'll be in my office . See you guys soon . " <p> " The social worker , " the doctor explained . He continued with a discussion of the lung bypass machine , that this particular hospital did n't have one and the baby would have to be transported across town to the university hospital . " ECMO , " the doctor called it . " It 's like a spaceship . It 's the latest thing . " He waved his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We do n't need to talk about it quite yet . " <p> The father rose from his chair . He liked being in the room Listening to the doctor , listening to all the possibilities that existed , how possible they all seemed . He liked the closed , sealed feeling of the office with its certificates and family pictures . He liked the doctor . The mother got up , still moving with fatigue and pain . They thanked the doctor and crossed the hall to the social worker 's office . It was smaller and no framed diplomas hung on the wall . <p> " How you guys doing ? " the social worker said . She gestured them into hard plastic chairs . <p> " Fine , " the mother said . <p> " I have a few things I want to go over with you . " She reached across the desk and handed both the parents her business card . She told them about pumping breast milk and bringing it into the ICN to store for when the baby was ready to eat . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooms , how they were only for parents of babies awaiting discharge , so they could become accustomed to nighttime changing and feeding . It was best to sleep at home until that time , the social worker said . " Although you 're welcome at any time to visit her , " she said . " She 's a cute baby . " She fetched them sealed bottles of sterile water to empty and store the breast milk in , and she called and reserved an electric breast pump for them and doublechecked to make sure their insurance covered the cost . " Is there anything else I can do for you ? " she said . <p> " I do n't think so , " the father said . <p> " I 'm here Monday through Friday , eight-thirty to five . " She stood up and shook both their hands . " You just come in if you want to talk . " She pointed at her card that the father held in his palm . " I have voice mail , too . " <p> " Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside the social worker 's office was a large corkboard filled with pictures of ICN parents departing with their babies , with birth dates and birth weights and discharge dates written in ink below each photo . The parents paused to study it , looking for a baby like their baby , but all of the babies had been preemies . <p> Back on the maternity ward the mother climbed tiredly into her bed , her face pale . It was almost noon . Curtains around the beds were all drawn , and they could hear the cooing and gurgling sounds of mothers with their babies . <p> " Hey there " a man 's voice announced . " Can I come in ? " <p> " What is it ? " the father said . <p> A white-haired man in a red volunteer 's blazer parted the curtain . " I 'm here to help you fill out the necessaries on your child 's birth certificate . " <p> The father 's stomach cinched . <p> " What is it ? " the mother said . <p> " Nothing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's name ?

" They wanted to keep me another day but I told them no . " <p> " Good , " the father said . <p> Tears ran from the corners of her eyes down the sides of her face . She shut her eyes and her face trembled . <p> " I guess I 'm really tired , " she said . <p> He climbed in beside her . Her back was to him and he reached around and held her and she shook . She was very quiet . He could feel the curtains of their third of the room close around them . He wanted to whisper that it was going to be all right . He said , " We 're going to be all right . " His wife continued crying in that silent way . Every few moments he 'd pull himself up and see the tears streaming down the exposed side of her face . They 'd known each other seven years , they 'd been married three years . His father had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strange city for three months after a complicated open heart surgery . The baby herself had had trouble very early , in the fourth or fifth week of pregnancy , and a doctor had announced that they were going to lose her then . There 'd been pre-term labor in early June that confined the wife to bedrest for a month . Past the middle of her labor , late yesterday afternoon , the mother had requested something for pain and the anesthesiologist had injected so much epidural anesthesia into her spine that she was numb from the neck down and her blood pressure had dropped to seventy-two over forty and the baby 's heartbeat had decelerated so precipitously it appeared almost to have stopped . Doctors and nurses had burst into the delivery room , a rush and swirl of activity that the husband had been both sucked into and pushed out from , as he felt his wife 's life and the baby 's life and even his own life pulled from him , and they 'd injected the wife with Adrenalin , and attached a fetal heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they declared that everything was fine , and that she could proceed with a vaginal delivery . And now here they were . Soon the wife would finish crying and the husband would rise from the bed and hug her and go out the door and down the corridor to the elevator , which he 'd take to the lobby , where outside he 'd catch a taxi almost precisely twenty-four hours from when the taxi had dropped them off at the hospital . At home he would arrange for a rental car ; perhaps a phone call or two would trap him ; though he would try not to answer but , of course , he would have to answer . He 'd pick up the rental car downtown , pick up the electric breast pump , and return to the hospital for his wife . They 'd spend that night at home , and every night at home , curled up in bed by the telephone , spent from the days of back-and-forthing to the hospital and pumping milk and sterilizing equipment every three hours and waking in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and call the hospital , until one night : the phone would ring , or perhaps they 'd even be there at the hospital , and an ultimate shift would occur that would change their lives forever . One day their baby would breathe air again . Though lying in bed with his wife now , waiting for this sequence to unravel , he knew they were already changed . He held his wife tightly , as she cried herself out , and he was astonished at how much they could hold between them , and how hard it could be to name . <p>
