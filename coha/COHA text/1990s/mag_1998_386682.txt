<p> When a lump turned up on her annual mammogram , contributing editor Linda Rao had to make a tough decision . Here , she outlines the choices you may have to make someday <p> After nearly nine years as a researcher for Prevention , I know a lot about breast lumps and how they 're diagnosed . But nothing could prepare me for the shock of finding a lump myself at the age of 37 . <p> Yet , last year , when a mammogram revealed a lump in my right breast , I found myself discussing it with my husband very matter-of-factly , even scientifically : " I 'll need either a core-needle or an excisional biopsy , " I yelled from the shower one morning as he was shaving at the sink . " A core biopsy is when they just take tissue samples from the lump with a hollow needle . An excisional biopsy is when they remove the whole thing . " Then I paused and thought to myself , " Gee , you 're taking this all pretty well , are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Was n't I ? The Questionable Mammogram <p> When my annual mammogram showed a lump , I was n't too surprised . I 'd had cysts before-and I have a family history of cancer . Two of my dad 's sisters died of cancer-one from breast cancer , during her 40s ; the other from lymphoma , cancer of the lymph nodes , when she was just 17 . Some experts think that a woman 's cancer risk increases only if her mother or other maternal relative has had breast cancer . But as the former cancer specialist for Prevention , I know that some experts now think a woman 's cancer risk increases if one of her paternal relatives has had the disease . <p> I went to see my doctor , who assured me that the lump was probably benign . But to be safe , he wanted me to have an ultrasound , a test in which sound waves passed through the breast would provide a picture of the lump and tell us whether it was solid or filled with fluid . Filled with fluid , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be cancer . <p> A few days later , the ultrasound revealed that the mass was solid . Meeting with the Surgeon <p> To my surprise , I was n't frightened . But I was concerned . This was the first lump I 'd ever had that might not be harmless . I wanted to see the surgeon right away , and I wanted the lump-whatever it was-out of my body as soon as possible . <p> I made an appointment right away with Kamalesh Shah , MD , a surgeon in Allentown , PA , whom my doctor had recommended . Dr. Shah showed me my mammogram and ultrasound , then read the reports : There was indeed a mass in my right breast , and the radiologist recommended a biopsy to rule out cancer . Dr. Shah assured me that the lump was probably benign . The odds were in my favor : At least 70 to 80% of breast lumps are , in fact , benign . But we needed to be sure , and a biopsy was the only way . <p> When we were finished discussing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examining table , and he showed me exactly where the lump was . With some effort , I found it , and to my surprise , it felt hard , like a raw pea beneath my skin . The benign cysts I 'd had were squishy . <p> Even though I had no delusions about what I was actually doing in that examining room , it seemed surreal . When Dr. Shah spoke , it was as if he were talking to me from the next room . I was focused on the hard , tiny lump under my skin . No longer was a biopsy something I was reading about in a medical journal for Prevention . It was something that I was about to experience . <p> That 's when it hit me : What if I were one of the 20 to 30% of women whose results come back positive ? I 'd been lucky up until now . But cancer happens to people all the time . And nearly 210,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer every year . Had I now become one of them ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exam , Dr. Shah gave me my options : I could wait six months to see what my next mammogram revealed : a cyst might very well disappear , for example . Or , I could have the lump biopsied immediately . I knew I did n't want to wait six months . I could n't imagine trying to sleep every night thinking about what was inside me . I wanted the biopsy now . <p> Patiently , Dr. Shah went through all my options , even drawing pictures of each procedure . He outlined what was involved in each-even where he would inject the needle if I chose a core-needle biopsy and where he would cut the skin if I went the surgical route . ( To learn about the different types of biopsies , see " If You Need a Biopsy " on p 109 . ) <p> I knew that either type of biopsy would detect cancer if it were there . Both are extremely accurate . The problem was that both procedures would remove only samples of tissue . And if I had cancer , I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole lump and be done with it ? I opted for an excisional biopsy-what 's known as a lumpectomy . A Second Shock <p> A few days later , I decided to give myself a thorough going-over , just in case something else was lurking . I checked my left breast and was stunned to find another solid-feeling mass that had n't shown up on the mammogram . When I saw Dr. Shah next , I told him , " I found another lump . I want you to remove that one too . " Although he thought the new one was probably benign too , I convinced him that I needed it removed , if only for my peace of mind . " D Day " Arrives <p> On surgery day , I woke up early with my stomach aflutter . I was obsessed with the unknowns : the needles , the potential pain , the results . But my husband promised I 'd be okay and that he 'd be with me right up until surgery and waiting for me when they wheeled me back from the recovery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procedure , so I was taken to a small holding room with a lounge chair , where I was given a surgical cap , gown , and slippers . The nurse pricked my arm to start an IV that contained a sedative ( biopsies are done under local anesthesia and sedation ) . I felt relaxed and slightly drowsy . <p> At 8 am , it was time . I walked to the operating room with my nurse escort , where I climbed up onto a gurney . After a dose of sedation through my IV-a heavy dose , at my request-I was out . <p> And that was it . I woke to the sound of beeps , voices , and Dr. Shah 's smiling face , which I translated as good news . It was indeed : Both masses looked like benign tissue , and Dr. Shah felt confident the biopsy results would bear that out . My scars would be barely visible . He had made two 1/2-inch incisions next to the areola ( dark area ) of each breast . Over time , both would fade and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small in relation to the size of my breasts , they would n't look lopsided , which can be an aftereffect of this kind of procedure . <p> Soon after , I was wheeled back to my husband in the holding room where I had started . And after feasting on hugs , graham crackers , and ginger ale , I headed home . It was only 1:30 pm , and I was done . Except for the waiting . Living through the Hardest Part <p> My follow-up care was so minimal it almost seemed as if I had n't been through surgery at all . But even though Dr. Shah had assured me that everything looked normal , I did n't feel relieved . While I went about my life pretty much as I always did , waiting for the results was n't as easy as I expected . We 'd be out with friends , having a great time , when suddenly something would remind me of my unfinished business and there I 'd be , swept right back into the worry . My carefree smile would disappear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you be so cavalier ? Bad news could be just around the corner ! " <p> Finally , after a week of emotional ups and downs , Dr. Shah 's nurse called to give me the news : Benign tissue ; no evidence of cancer ! My breasts were perfectly healthy , she announced . There were no signs of anything worrisome at all . <p> She was happy , and I 'd like to say I was ecstatic-that it was a moment of tears and triumph . But , oddly enough , neither the phone call nor the follow-up appointment erased my fear completely . It took several weeks for the truth to sink in and for the dark clouds to dissipate . But just as my scars faded , over time , so did my fear . <p> I still religiously get a clinical breast exam and a mammogram every June and do monthly breast self-exams , and , believe it or not , I do n't worry much that someday something terrible will turn up . Yes , I have a family history , and yes , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of getting a virulent form of breast cancer . But this experience gave me something I was n't sure I had before : a clean bill of health . I figure that 's ground zero . And if I take care of myself , it 's where I 'll stay . Four Important Stages Stage 1 <p> Cancer is confined to the breast , with or without dimpling of the skin . Stage 2 <p> The tumor is larger and the axillary nodes may be affected . Surgery may cure , but some systemic treatment is usually advised . Stage 3 <p> Cancer has invaded the muscles of the chest wall , the overlying skin , or possibly the lymph nodes above the collarbone . Stage 4 <p> The cancer has spread elsewhere in the body , typically the bones , liver , or lungs .
