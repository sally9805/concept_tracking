The squat , twin-arched concrete bridge at No Gun Ri was built to span a small creek . But for a terrifying three days in late July 1950 , it spanned a killing field . Last week the Pentagon was stunned by an Associated Press report , backed up by eyewitness accounts , that a frightened U.S. Army unit had killed as many as 300 civilians at No Gun Ri in the opening weeks of the Korean War . Such a bloodbath would rank as the century 's second deadliest committed by U.S. troops , trailing only the 1968 My Lai massacre in Vietnam , where G.I.s killed up to 500 noncombatants . <P> Accounts of what happened at No Gun Ri , a hamlet some 100 miles southeast of Seoul , are hazy and conflicting . But taken together , they paint a picture of panic , fear , vague military orders and , finally , individual G.I.s struggling with the dictates of conscience . The Koreans under the bridge were part of a wave fleeing the North Korean army as it plunged southward in a month-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garb had been slipping through U.S. lines , guiding in artillery strikes and sniping at the retreating Americans . Days earlier , units of the 1st Cavalry Division had issued a chilling order . " No refugees to cross the front line . Fire everyone trying to cross lines , " it said . " Use discretion in case of women and children . " <P> G.I.s say a throng  --  including many women , children and old men  --  had sought protection under the No Gun Ri bridge from an earlier , perhaps errant , U.S. air raid . They had been pinned down for three days . U.S. forces at the bridge came under repeated enemy attack . The G.I.s regularly fired bursts over the heads of the cowering civilians . " But then we were ordered to kill them all , " Edward Daily of Clarksville , Tenn. , then a corporal in the 7th Cavalry Regiment 's 2nd Battalion , told TIME . " So I lowered the barrel and kept firing . " <P> Some veterans say the killing started on an order from their commander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was acting on radioed orders from headquarters . " We were ordered to shoot and kill anything because a lot of them were North Koreans who might set up machine guns in rice paddies and shoot at us , " says Delos Flint of Clio , Mich. , then a private . Other members of the battalion say they fired in response to muzzle flashes from the darkened arches late on July 26 . <P> Regardless of how it began , " all of a sudden , machine guns started firing into the crowd of people under the bridge , " recalls George Preece of Dunnville , Ky. , then a sergeant , who manned a machine gun on the railroad tracks at one end of the span . Several former soldiers said the firing continued unabated for 30 min . " They were hugging the concrete floor , and I could hear screams  --  of pain and horror  --  coming from women and children , " Daily says . James Kerns of Piedmont , S.C. , then a sergeant , was firing another machine gun , and says he deliberately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left plenty of room for that . " I 'm positive I never hit anybody , " Kerns says . Flint estimates that half the troops near him fired on the civilians , and half  --  including himself  --  refused . " I could n't see killing kids , " he says , " even if they were infiltrators. "
