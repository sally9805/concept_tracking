FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS , the first week of April has often been a time when their heroes have died . In 1950 it was blood-plasma pioneer Dr. Charles R. Drew . In 1968 it was Martin Luther King Jr . Last week it was Carl Stokes of Cleveland , the first black big-city mayor , and Ron Brown , Bill Clinton 's Secretary of Commerce , who at 54 perished doing what he always did best : trying to make deals . <P> Brown will be remembered more as the Frank Robinson than the Jackie Robinson of big-league politics  --  that is , as a star manager instead of a player . Most black leaders make their mark by demanding that blacks get a seat at the table . Brown not only sat at the table , but often sat at its head . He was among the first of a new breed of black Washington insiders with the connections and influence to make things happen for clients as diverse as civil rights leaders and fat-cat corporate executives . Jesse Jackson , for one , describes himself as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Brown was just the reverse , a jelly maker par excellence . <P> That skill came to Brown naturally . He grew up in Harlem during the 1940s and ' 50s , when it was a vibrant crossroads of black culture , prestige and political savvy . He was the pampered child of college-educated parents who equipped him with bottomless self-confidence , poise and ambition  --  everything except the power and wealth he later supplied for himself . His family 's apartment in the Theresa Hotel , where his father was manager , looked down at the glittering Apollo theater and was only a few yards away from the corner of 125th Street and Seventh Avenue , where street orators expostulated on everything from Garveyism to the theory of predestination . <P> But even as a child , Brown learned to be comfortable in the white world . Unlike most blacks of his generation , he had little firsthand experience with white racism . He went to elementary school in midtown Manhattan , to high school in suburban White Plains and to college at Middlebury in Vermont , where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more tellingly , the first one in the local chapter of the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity . His frat brothers liked him so much that they defied the whites-only charter to pledge him . As a newly commissioned Army second lieutenant en route to a post in Virginia , he was so naive about what it could mean to be black in America that when a waitress at a segregated Newport News , Virginia , drive-in refused to serve him and his wife , he recalled later , " I thought maybe there was something wrong with the car door . " When it dawned on him that he had been rejected because of his race , Brown drove off , apparently without making a protest . It was the first time his charm had not protected him from being treated as a second-class citizen .
