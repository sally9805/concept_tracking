Tim Couch is more than just an off-the-beaten-path story of a kid who always dreamed of playing in the NFL . He 's a naturaland we 're not just talking about talent . Photograph // State trooper James Caudill 's house is a ways up the hilly winding road , just outside tiny Hyden , Ky . In his garage , he stacked big bags of Joy Dog Food . With Caudill 's permission-and that was smart , because the one guy you do n't want mad-at you in rural southeastern Kentucky is the local state trooper-a teen-aged Tim Couch and his buddies frequently grabbed several of the sacks from the garage . They dragged them to the nearby pond on Caudill 's property , dropped them on the bank and used them as benches . They hooked nightcrawlers and cast out the lines . As they fished , they spoke in the sort of drawls that tend to add syrup each mile deeper into the Daniel Boone National Forest . They discussed school . Sports . Girls . lopes . Other days , they might go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crags , but the conversations were similar . Sometimes it was only Tim Couch and Scott Brock , the closest of friends longer than they could remember . Couch says he was told that when he and Brock were toddlers and went to the same day-care facility , " we used to wrestle , so they finally had to tie our walkers to separate ends of the couch . That 's how early we started being best friends . " Or often , it was a band of four , with Ricky Hensley and Paul Melton joining Scott and Tim . As they got closer to high school graduation , Brock talked more about coming back to the area after college and becoming a teacher , like his parents . Hensley was going to college and then seeing what developed . Melton was pondering a career in the Navy . Couch was going to be an NFL quarterback . They did n't laugh at each other , at least not at their dreams . By the time they were old enough to drive to the fishing spots , their buddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as plausible as one of the others mentioning going to trade school and becoming a plumber . The competitiveness that makes the 6-4 , 225pound Couch so desperately yearn to be the No. 1 overall choice in the draft this year , and to become the expansion Cleveland Browns ' first marquee player , was honed in Hyden . To Tim , the draft is a competition as assuredly as a state semifinal playoff game or a driveway basketball game of one-on-one . Less than three years ago , Couch was walking through the hallways of a rural high school . Even after three seasons of playing Southeastern Conference football , Couch is n't that far removed from a milieu radically different from the world he will be entering when the Browns or another team drafts him . So the first instinct is to wonder if the culture shock can be overwhelming . Yet , it 's relative . Couch already has been in a spotlight as tightly focused as anything he will face in the next few years . In a tiny corner of the world , he has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nutter Training Center , the football workout facility on the University of Kentucky campus in Lexington , Couch introduces Ricky Hensley . Ricky is " from back home , " Couch says , quickly adding that he caught 97 passes when Couch was a senior at Leslie County High School in Hyden . Photograph A FRIENDLY PASS RUSH : Couch once connected with Hyden pal Hensley for 97 passes . But , here , Hensley playfully tries to take the ball from the potential No. 1 overall draft pick in the NFL. // Ricky is a slight 5-11 or so , and he wears a baseball hat pulled tight . He is going to Lexington Community College but still hangs out with Couch . After about , oh , 20 seconds in their presence , it seems apparent this was how it used to be in the Leslie County lunchroom or dressing room , or at the pond . So how about those 97 Couch-to-Hensley completions ? " About 45 were behind me , " Hensley says . " About 40 , I was diving . " He grins wryly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiles , too . They head over to the fieldhouse and throw the ball around on the artificial-turf practice field as members of a track class go through their laps around them . Ten days earlier , Couch had thrown for NFL team personnel in a structured workout in the fieldhouse to show off the skills that will make him such a high pick in the draft , which begins April 17 . This is more low-key . Although Couch does a lot of serious work , throwing to spots , deliberately throwing off the wrong foot from a standing position , there also is time for fun . Couch and Hensley chase after each other , they spike the ball after " touchdowns , " and they laugh and taunt . But get Hensley away from Couch and he turns serious about the quarterback and their roots . " No way is he going to forget us , " Hensley says . " He knows that for the rest of his life , it 's going to be probably harder to make friends because most people who want to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who he is . We 've been friends since we were little . I know all the stupid things he 's done . But I would be his friend right now if he was the garbage man . " Most of the final hour of the 125-mile trip southeast from Lexington is on the Daniel Boone Parkway , the toll road through the mountain forest . The Hyden " Spur " is the offshoot of the parkway , and it ends at the flashing red light at the bottom of a big hill . At the light , there are two choices-turn left or right-and two blue signs with proud white lettering . " WELCOME TO LESLIE COUNTY , Home of No. 2 , Tim Couch . " Or , " WELCOME TO LESLIE COUNTY , Home of the Osborne Brothers . " A quarterback and a bluegrass group . Turn left and you 're heading into town . Turn right , and you 're going toward the home of Elbert Couch , 47 , a transportation supervisor for Leslie County , and Janice Couch , a supervisor for the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are diverse . A few have abandoned , rusting cars in the yards and look as if they could have been built by squatters . Others , though , could be on a cul-de-sac in a Los Angeles suburb , as seems to be the case with the bi-level Couch home , a combination of brown brick and logs . Elbert was raised in the even smaller community of Thousandsticks , near Hyden . Janice was the daughter of a coal miner from Jenkins , about 70 miles away . In the early years of the Couch marriage , Janice 's father , Herman Johnson , would work eight hours in the mine , then drive to Hyden and oversee the laying of the foundation for Elbert and Janice 's house . Soon , he retired and built much of the house himself . He left room for a huge driveway , one that soon became his grandsons ' basketball court . The yard was for football . Greg Couch is 4M2 years older than his brother . He had his own circle of friends , a circle often crashed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always were on opposite teams . When it was just the brothers , they played one-on-one . " I did n't have a lot of things to do except throw a ball all day long , " Tim says . " I did n't have the shopping malls and all kinds of stuff to get into . I 'd just throw a ball all day long with my brother and my friends . " For years , Greg was bigger and better . " He used to beat me at everything , and I think that 's what made me such a competitor , " Tim says . " I got it instilled in me pretty early that I hated losing . He used to rub it in , and then he beat me up after he beat me in the game . " Greg , now 25 , was a Leslie County High star before Tim and played quarterback for Eastern Kentucky . Tim used to think life would be terrific if he could only be as good as his brother . " I 'd beat him so bad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start crying , " Greg says . " I 'd kind of rub it in and make it worse or beat him up for crying . We 'd stay mad for a little bit , make up-and then do it again the next day . " Both brothers still laugh about the incident they say epitomizes Tim 's competitiveness . Tim was perhaps 12 , just getting to the point where he could stay close in the one-on-one games with his brother . Greg knew the day was coming when he was going to switch tactics , avoiding the brother-onbrother games altogether or making sure Tim was on his team . Greg made the final shot to win on the driveway . Angry and distraught , Tim grabbed the ball as it dropped through the net and aimed for the part of the house frame between the upstairs windows and the huge living room window . He tossed it right through the living room window . " My parents were only mad at me for a day , " he says , smiling . " They did n't make me pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to college , Tim was growing-and his image in the community was evolving into legend . At 14 , he was 6-3 . He was a football and basketball star by his freshman season at Leslie County High . Although the town itself is tiny-population 500 or so-the high school is n't . It is one level below the largest schools in the state . The children of loggers and coal miners ride buses as far as 35 miles . Many come from the little side roads into the mountain hollows . When Greg was at Eastern Kentucky , Tim was hanging around even more with his three friendsBrock , Hensley and Melton . " Everything we done , " Hensley says , " we done together . " That included football . After his sophomore year at Leslie County , Tim already was within striking distance of the state record for passing yardage . Recruiters and reporters started showing up at the high school . Couch was a big-time prospect and an off-the-beaten-path story . The town is on two sides of Rockhouse Creek , a tiny channel of water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ravine , the scene is generically old small town-library , county courthouse , hardware store , pharmacy , jewelry store , extension service . The grade school , the small hospital and several homes and little offices are on the other side of the creek . At the end of Main Street , there is another " T. " Go right , and you 're heading along the Middle Fork to the high school . The brick high school is only six years old , built next to the Richard M. Nixon Recreation Center , which was dedicated in 1978 and even drew the former president to Hyden for the ceremony . Between the two entrances to the high school cafeteria , a display case is about eight feet high . It holds nothing but Tim Couch memorabilia , including his maroon No. 2 jersey , his game pants and his helmet . The awards include the Gatorade plaque as the national player of the year . Principal Omus Shepherd has been at the school for more than 20 years . " When you have people around you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens to make you realize this is n't an everyday thing , " he says in his office . " It 's like electricity . You turn on the switch , and you do n't really wonder where the light came from . But the thing with Tim Couch for me was when we went over to play at Belfry ( a small Kentucky town near the West Virginia border ) when he was a junior . We beat " em , and after the game , I saw a long line of young people and adults lined up to get his autograph . Adults from Belfry ! I said to myself , That boy really has something special . ' " He 's always had that charisma . When he competed , he made everyone around him want to rise to another level . That , to me , is what charisma is . " Couch could have gone anywhere , and he considered , among others , Tennessee , Florida and Ohio State . He chose Kentucky , the downtrodden-but home-state-program . " My first class was an English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big auditorium , and there were maybe 400 people in it . I remember thinking , My God , there are more people in this class than in my hometown . ' ' " Welcome to college , kid . Inexplicably , his first coach , Bill Curry , would n't reshape the offense for the Cats ' elite talent and Couch considered transferring . The offensively innovative Hal Mumme was hired to replace Curry for Couch 's sophomore season , and the wraps were off . Couch passed for 3,884 yards and 37 touchdowns , then 4,275 yards and 36 TDs as a junior . The decision to turn pro after that season was n't difficult : Couch is intelligent but was n't a rabid scholar , although he enjoyed the classes in his social work major He worked with troubled Lexington-area youths for one semester , for example , and found that rewarding . Other classes , he disdained . " Like algebra , " he says . " When are you going to walk into a bank and have somebody ask you , What is the value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kentucky football program , with both having been enriched . Commonwealth Stadium is being expanded , the Wildcats no longer are the joke of the SEC and Mumme is one of the bright coaches on the rise . You almost wonder if the Browns do n't take Couch with the No. 1 choice , he 's going to grab a ball , throw it right through a Manhattan window and tell himself that he should have stayed for his senior season at Kentucky . Photograph NATURAL BORN QB : Smart like Manning but more mobile , Couch is strong in all of the intangibles. // " That 's all competitiveness to me , " he says . " When I was 12 years old and dreaming of being in the NFL , I was n't dreaming of money , I was dreaming of that feeling you get when you 're an NFL quarterback . I worked to be the best I can be . That 's why I want to be the first pick so bad . The Browns would be building , Just like it was at Kentucky . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something I look forward to . " Confides his friend , Hensley : " He is n't going to change . ( All that he 's gone through ) would have done it by now if it was going to . I remember him saying , If they only knew before they wrote up these contracts that I would play for three meals a day .... ' ' . Couch was mentally taking notes on the contrasting rookie seasons of last year 's prized quarterbacks , the composed Peyton Manning and the imploding Ryan Leaf . Manning 's relative success , Couch says , " was because of his attitude . Off the field , he could handle people coming down on him , putting him under a lot of scrutiny . Ryan could n't handle it ; he probably had n't ever dealt with adversity before . I think Ryan is going to make it eventually , but Peyton made it his first year because he was calm and he knew he was going to get better . " Couch knows the issue will be : Can the Kentucky kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own yard , handle the inevitable adversity ? The conjecture here is that he will be able to cope . Unless we 're all wrong , he has the talent . He 's also smart enough to know what 's coming . The Couch personality package is unpolished , but there 's nothing wrong with that . Even his teammates will spot that he not only comes without layers of refinement , but also without layers of phoniness . The poise and charisma come with twangs , double negatives and a Charlie Daniels fiddle soundtrack . Yet all that can help him . He 's a natural-and we 're not just talking about talent . " I know there are going to be some trials , " Couch says . " I know it 's going to be a tough year . I 'm not expecting to come in and be a Randy Moss and make the Pro Bowl my first year . I know there is going to be a lot to learn , but as long as I stay patient and realize every quarterback went through it , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his brother to his NFL city and be his liaison with his agents and marketing group . He also will be an older brother , a buffer , a sounding board , a buddy . " That 's probably the most tremendous thing to happen to Tim , " Elbert says . " Tim needs somebody . He 's a smart boy and everything , but he and Greg are like one . " Ricky Hensley will be back in Lexington , working toward graduation . Paul Melton will be a Navy SEAL in Virginia But there will be a void in Tim 's life . The phone rang in his apartment on November 15 , the morning after the " Cats had beaten Vanderbilt , 55-17 . Couch heard the horrible news . Couch is n't much of a hunter , so he passed on taking a trip with Scott Brock , his Hyden pal , and two Kentucky teammates-center Jason Watts and defensive tackle Artie Steinmetz . Watts was driving his truck when he lost control 60 miles south of Lexington . Brock and Steinmetz were killed . Tests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleaded guilty last week to reckless homicide . Brock had started out at UK and transferred after a year to Eastern Kentucky . But he remained so close to Couch , the quarterback 's teammates were his friends . " At first , it was so early in the morning , I told myself , Hey , this ai n't real , ' " Couch says . " I knew I was going to wake up and tell myself I had n't really heard the horrifying news . Then I stayed in bed and cried for hours and hours . " The first couple of months , it was like Scott was on vacation or something . It seemed like I was going to walk in and he was going to be on my answering machine , like he was every day . I 'd come in and reach for the phone to call him and right before I grabbed it , I realized . I know if he was here , he would be proud of me , having a chance to be the No. 1 pick . He would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sitting there on the bank , fishing . I 'd be telling him how much I wanted to play in the NFL and how I dreamed of being there . It was funny , as we got older , it was getting more real . We could see that light at the end of the tunnel . I was going to make it . " TSN Sidebar More like Manning Sidebar Although the Browns have asked Tim Couch to have a private workout for them Sunday , it 's unlikely they 'll bypass him with the first pick of the draft . He looms as a franchise quarterback , as did Peyton Manning and Ryan Leaf a year ago . So , how does Couch match up against last year 's top two picks ? Sidebar Couch is a lot more like Manning than Leaf in several areas , especially the intangibles . He is smart , loves the game , studies videotape and appears to be mature , much like Manning . He is well-respected by teammates and coaches , and he has excellent physical skills . He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably not quite as physically gifted as Leaf . Like Leaf , Couch enjoyed two productive seasons and left school a year early . Manning played four seasons ( three as a starter ) at Tennessee . The maturity factor of a quarterback staying in school for his senior year ca n't be underestimated , and if Couch starts as a rookie , he figures to struggle more than Manning did with Indianapolis last year . But not nearly as much as Leaf with San Diego . Couch has a much better head on his shoulders . - Gary Horton , The War Room Author Affiliation Terry Frei is a sportswriter for The Denver Post . // <p>
