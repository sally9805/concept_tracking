Aviara is a must-play for any San Diego visitor ; its beauty and emphasis on creative shotmaking make it both memorable and fun . // THE SAN DIEGO AREA has many assets : a mild yearround climate , a dramatic Pacific coastline and an array of leisure activities , such as Sea World and the San Diego Zoo . Its proximity to Mexico gives the city a cultural flair , and it is mentioned on several lists of the best places to live . In short , it would seem to have all the elements for a firstclass golf destination . The truth is , however , that there is a big drop-off in quality between the top tier and those below ( although there 's not always a dropoff in price ) . San Diego County has more than 80 golf facilities , and it becomes tough to weed out the very good from the simply average . So San Diego becomes a first-class destination only if you know the places to go . The attempt here , then , is to present the upper tier . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ County , beginning about 20 miles north of downtown San Diego and extending up towards the Riverside County line , includes Aviara , La Costa , Rancho Bernardo Inn , Mt . Woodson , Temecula Creek Inn and Redhawk . The immediate metro area and eastern suburbs contain Torrey Pines , Carlton Oaks , Steele Canyon and Coronado . One thing that should be mentioned right away is the area 's breadth . This is n't Pinehurst or Pebble Beach , where most of the top courses are within an easy drive . Be prepared to log some miles on the freeways of Southern California , as some of the facilities require a 45-minute drive or more to get to the first tee . Consequently , finding a place to stay in the correct region makes the process of traveling to the courses much more manageable . NORTH COUNTY Built upon a hilly , rugged piece of property in the town of Carlsbad , the superb Aviara Golf Club is an upscale gem that provides an interesting , challenging , yet fair test of golf . Arnold Palmer , reversing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constructed a fun layout which offers players of varying abilities a chance to score well . Stretching to 7,007 yards from the tips , Aviara can be daunting on a few holes , but has excellent visual definition to help rookie players feel more comfortable . The huge greens afford many pin positions , altering the necessary shape and length of approaches each time around . Each nine has a different flavor , with the front side climbing to the course 's apex before culminating in the seventh through ninth holes , three exciting downhillers . The seventh extends to 404 yards , and the approach shot plays off a downhill lie to an undulating green guarded by deep bunkers . The eighth presents an interesting decision for the long hitter . Playing 536 yards downhill , it can be reached in two after a good drive . However , a pond guards the front , making it a risky proposition . Standing on the tee of the 375yard , dogleg-right ninth , you may feel that a good drive down the right might cut the corner and even reach the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is needed to clear rough-covered mounds , so the smart play is a long iron down the left to leave a good angle into the large , two-tiered green . The flatter back nine meanders through a heavily-wooded valley surrounded by hills , upon which expansive homes are being built at a intense pace . Fortunately , they do not encroach on play . The landscaping around many of the holes is lavish , with abundant waterfalls and foliage . However , the site 's natural beauty is impressive enough on its own . Aviara opened in 1991 but had been in the planning stages since 1988 , when a full-scale resort was proposed for the site . The resort plans were put on hold after a severe economic downturn hit California . The golf course proceeded as planned , however , and earned distinction as a GOLF MAGAZINE " Top 10 You Can Play " pick for 1992 . It stood alone until early August 1997 , when the $200 million Four Seasons Resort Aviara finally opened its doors . The hotel is majestic . Sitting atop a hill overlooking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel is the final ingredient needed to make Aviara a complete resort destination .

Photograph The tee shot on the 171-yard seventh hole at Steele Canyon must carry a deep ravine and avoid pot bunkers to reach the hillside green . // Almost directly across El Camino Real-Carlsbad 's main drag from Aviara is the La Costa Resort &; Spa , a GOLF MAGAZINE Silver Medal Resort and a Southern California institution for 33 years . Although the resort is famous for its spa , the golf at La Costa is also well-known , as the host of the PGA Tour 's season-opening Mercedes Championships since 1969 ( the event moves to Hawaii in 1999 ) . The tournament is played over a composite layout of the North and South courses , consisting of holes one through three and 13-18 of the North Course and the entire back nine of the South course . These comprised the resort 's original 18 holes , designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a protege of Wilson 's , completed nine more holes in 1973 and the final nine in 1985 to complete the two distinct layouts . The South Course gets more publicity and television time during the tournament , but the 6,987yard North Course is the more intriguing layout . It was the parthree 16th hole of the North ( played as the seventh during the tournament ) , on which Tiger Woods beat Tom Lehman in a one-hole playoff to win the 1997 event . Crossing the road after the North Course 's third hole brings the player to the most interesting nine holes on the property . Four through 12 traverse rolling hillsides and a series of pesky lakes . The par-four seventh , at 460 yards from the tips , is a simple but great golf hole with an excellent view of the surrounding hills . A downhill tee shot sets up a midiron approach from an uneven lie to a small green . Nothing fancy , just a strategic and scenic hole . The stretch runs on both courses are memorable , but the edge has to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenges , and all play into the prevailing wind . The approach shot on the 568-yard , par-five 17th is one of the scariest in golf , with water guarding the entire right side and trees to the left . Take advantage of a rare treat while at La Costa : being able to walk the golf course . For $40 , a caddie will guide you across the property , and the course 's relative flatness makes it easy on the legs . La Costa is a part of the old guard of resorts that attracts many visitors on its name alone . The courses could use better maintenance in spots , but in fairness to the grounds crew , many of the brownish patches of grass are caused by salt water seeping into the course 's lower spots from a nearby lagoon . Play on both courses is reserved for hotel guests and the over 600 members of the golf club , many of whom live out of the area . Tee times are available with advance planning and the pace of play is good for a resort . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rancho Bernardo , the Rancho Bernardo Inn awaits visitors looking for an authentic western resort experience . The community dates back to 1769 when it was created from a land grant by the King of Spain . The Battle of San Pasqual took place here in 1846 , playing a pivotal role in the annexation of California by the U.S. two years later . Rancho Bernardo takes on a frontier theme , despite its 1990 's suburban environment . The buildings are characterized by dark woods and soft lighting , with earthy decorations and a saloon-style lounge . The resort 's original West Course was designed by Ted Robinson , a prolific California architect . An old-style course stretching to 6,458 yards from the back tees , the West is routed through a valley and features generally small greens and treelined fairways . Characteristic of many older courses , the holes are very straightforward . Though it is not without challenge , this is a course on which better players can expect to score well , given they can hit the target greens . For an entirely different golf experience , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Woodson Country Club , a layout unlike anything else in the area . Picture the rockiest , most rugged hills you 've ever seen and you 've got the setting for this 6 , 113-yard track , where being a billy goat would seem to an advantage . In fact , the site is a thriving nature preserve , with several species of plant and animal life . This is the toughest 6,000yard course you will ever play , as it demands some long carries off the tee and precise club selection to avoid the unplayable vegetation engulfing the property . Each hole is named , including such favorites as " Razor 's Edge , " " The Plunge , " and " Make a Bet . " The layout has some fantastic short par fours and a downright sadistic par-three third hole , which at 202 yards from the tips demands a perfect tee shot to avoid the woods both left and right . The 361-yard 17th hole begins at the highest point on the course , and requires a solid tee shot to have a good angle into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ball in play here scoring should not be a major problem . Just in case , bring extra balls and a positive attitude , and be sure to take the time to enjoy the stunning views of the stark countryside . Mt . Woodson is just off Archie Moore Road , and the famed boxer 's training facility overlooks the course from a nearby hill . The clubhouse is next to the Amy Strong Castle , a national historic landmark completed in 1921 . A seamstress who was said to have run one of the first garment factories in San Diego , Strong retired in 1912 and used her earnings to invest in the 27-room mansion , where she lived until 1940 . Heading north on Interstate 15 , just over the Riverside County line , is the hamlet of Temecula and the Temecula Creek Inn . This 27hole facility was co-designed by Ted Robinson and Dick Rosen , with the Oaks and Creek nines coming first in 1969 and the Stonehouse nine added a few years later . The Oaks is by far the best nine on the property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one through eight provide an interesting mix of challenges , and several holes look right in the face of the surrounding mountains . Elevated tees and slight doglegs characterize the layout , with the 404-yard fourth hole demanding a drive down the right to have an open angle into the green . The ninth hole on the Oaks , and indeed the ninth hole on all three nines , is unfortunately out of character with the previous eight holes . A par four stretching to 405 yards , the ninth at the Oaks has an extremely narrow driving area , set between two artificial lakes . The green is surrounded by water on three sides with a tall fountain to the left . After eight enjoyable holes , the gimmicks are a bit of a letdown . The Creek nine is more traditional resort golf , with open fairways and smaller greens . The two par fives are relatively open , so the green light is on to fire away . If you like target golf and want some practice on uneven lies , head to the Stonehouse nine . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come . It 's a 505yard par five with a blind , uphill tee shot to a narrow landing area . From there , the hole doglegs left around a treeline to a narrow green . Par is a very good score here . Holes three through seven demand accuracy and some local knowledge to score . The third , a 402-yard par four , plays up to the crest of a hill before tumbling back down to a green obscured a by a large tree . Even if your game is on , these nine holes can be a maddening roller-coaster ride . The Temecula Creek Inn is situated in a fertile valley with 14 wineries in the immediate area . Save time for a tour of the winemaking process , especially if it 's been a tough day on the course . Just a few miles east of Temecula lies Redhawk Golf Club , a planned community , still partly under construction , with an interesting 7,180-yard layout as its centerpiece . The course was designed by architect Fred Bliss and PGA Tour pro Mark O'Meara , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desert . An impressive set of long par fours greatly toughens the track , and the holes are woven together nicely . Characterized by deep grass and sand bunkers around the greens , Redhawk is not overly challenging from the tee but plays tough if your iron game is not on . Many of the greens have severe slopes , and the fourth has four separate tiers on which pin positions can be placed . Many greens are encircled by fairway chipping areas , creating the possibility of long putts from off the green and bringing bump-and-runs into play . // At a Glance Photograph The 36 holes at Torrey Pines are bustling with locals and tourists , all coming to experience the beauty and thrill of golf by the Pacific . // The 165-yard eighth hole plays to an island green , but the most dramatic par three on the course is the 17th . Standing on the elevated back tee , 210 yards from the green , one gets the feeling they are teeing off the edge of a cliff . Even with the expansion of the surrounding community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private . With reasonable green fees and a friendly staff , it 's worth the drive to play this one . METRO SAN DIEGO The most storied and perhaps best-loved property in the immediate San Diego area is Torrey Pines , a 36-hole municipal facility which has hosted the PGA Tour 's Buick Invitational ( formerly San Diego Open ) since 1968 . Torrey Pines consists of the sportier 6,647-yard North Course , which the PGA Tour pros play in either the first or second round , and the 7,055-yard South Course , which hosts the weekend play . Managed by the city of San Diego , these two remarkable layouts are a great example of toplevel municipal golf . Laid out over the cliffs of La Jolla , north of downtown , they offer breathtaking ocean views and an ongoing battle with the wind . The brawnier South Course has no gimmicks or illusions-it 's just a pure test of golf . Holes two through five are set atop an oceanside cliff . The 453-yard , par four fourth hole is as tough as any in the area . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the narrow , slick green usually requires a long iron to reach in two . The South 's back nine is varied , with 12 and 13 a dynamic duo of challenge and beauty . Upon completing the tough 468-yard , parfour 12 th , the par-five 13 th stretches to 535 yards and features a fairway which dives into a deep ravine about 200 yards short of the green . The blind approach is then hit to a small , undulating green . The North Course , while shorter , also has a superb set of oceanfront holes and plays very fairly . The signature hole is the sixth , a downhill par three stretching to 206 yards from the tips but playing around 155 for most players . With a tiny green set in between three bunkers and a dangerous falloff to the left , this shot is one of the trickiest on the course . Torrey Pines is the only public facility in San Diego directly on the ocean , making it wildly popular with both locals and tourists . Which brings us to the next question-how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make . You can call the computerized tee time reservation number ( 619-570-1234 ) up to seven days in advance , starting at 5:00 a.m . Pacific Time , and try your luck . Hint : especially with a foursome , do n't bet on this method . Locals have a big edge , as their " redial fingers " are in top shape . The most reliable , albeit most costly , way to get on Torrey Pines is to call the pro shop at ( 619 ) 452-3226 and book a tee time more than one week in advance . This package deal includes tee time , cart and three holes played with the local golf professional , for $95 ( $45 above the regular green fee ) . For overnight golf packages , the Lodge at Torrey Pines ( 800995-4507 ) offers a two-night , one-round package with breakfast from $199 per person . The bottom line , however , is that it 's worth the hassle to play Torrey Pines . The courses may not be immaculate ( they get over 300,000 rounds per year ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is memorable . Moving inland , Carlton Oaks is a Perry Dye-redesign of a course originally built in 1960 . Reopened in 1989 after a one-year , $5 million renovation , Carlton Oaks has now taken its place among the better layouts in the area . Located in a tranquil valley east of downtown , the layout is more than 7,000 yards from the tips and features several of the usual Dye characteristics : railroad ties , short par fours , and deep pot bunkers . Number five is only 305 yards long , but it 's almost impossible to get close to the green with your drive . Tall mounds , a series of bunkers , and a fairway which narrows to just over 15 feet wide make it a gamble not worth taking . // Ole ! // The back nine is longer and has less water than the front . Holes 13 through 15 will test your patience , as they are all long and narrow , with a precipitous number of mounds and pot bunkers . Carlton Oaks has a limited number of guest rooms on site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of note is the Gary Player-designed Steele Canyon Golf Club , in the town of Jamul . The 27 holes-the Canyon , Ranch and Meadows nines-are carved through a variety of terrain . The Canyon Course is the most spectacular , beginning at the clubhouse and rising swiftly up a hillside . The downhill fourth hole , called " Goosebumps , " plays a bit shorter than its 524 yards and offers a great view from the tee . Its narrow fairway is tough to hit , and the approach to the green must carry a ravine of brush and rocks . The Ranch nine winds through a working cattle ranch called Ivanhoe . The owner of the ranch at one time owned all the property on which Steele Canyon sits , but sold off a large parcel for the building of the golf club . Beyond the fifth hole , a tricky par five entitled " Double Cross , " is a display of ancient farm equipment dating back to the turn of the century , making the journey to the next tee far more interesting . The Meadow nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is routed through an adjacent housing development and offers little in the way of dramatic shots . Steele Canyon is less diabolical than many other Gary Player designs , and fits in very well with the surrounding property . Walking is allowed , and affords the best means of enjoying the views . The final stop is downtown San Diego , or rather the quaint community of Coronado , which sits right across San Diego Bay . It is home to the world-famous Hotel del Coronado and a large Navy air station , as well as a pretty nifty municipal golf course . Considerably less expensive than others in the area , and slightly easier to get on than Torrey Pines , Coronado is a windswept 6,633 yarder with super views of downtown and the waterfront . Opened in 1955 , the holes are fun and in decent condition , and the atmosphere is unpretentious . Five holes are on the bay , while the others roam through a heavily-wooded parkland setting . Holes 14-16 look out over a huge marina and the Hotel del Coronado . The second and third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to the waterfront . They were built on landfill from the construction of the Coronado Bridge , connecting downtown with the tiny Coronado Island . Coronado 's airy new clubhouse looks like it belongs in a fancy country club . The course is also undergoing some minor renovations , including the lengthening of the 10th hole .
