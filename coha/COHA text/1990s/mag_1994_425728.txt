Dealing with Cuba and Haiti Conventional wisdom has it that Haiti would be much easier to set right than Cuba . Want to bet ? <p> THE CRISES in Cuba and Haiti remind me of a story about Jimmy Carter and Mao Tse-tung . Responding to one of President Carter 's determined questions about human rights in China , particularly the freedom to leave the country , Chairman Mao supposedly asked : " Do you really want all my dissidents to have the freedom to leave ? How many do you want in the U.S. ? Fifty million ? " <p> Fidel Castro has called President Clinton 's bluff in a similar way . Cuban exiles in Florida who believed that the flood of refugees would lead to the regime 's collapse were sorely disappointed when Clinton ended the automatic asylum policy . It is as if , just as Erich Honecker opened the Berlin Wall in November 1989 , the West Germans had closed it on their side . This was designed to help Clinton 's electoral prospects in Florida but may well backfire . It may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blame their problems on outsiders . <p> If Cuba is a tough case , it is usually thought that America can at least solve the Haitian problem . President Clinton has declared his intention to use " all means " to restore democracy in Haiti ; this restored democracy in turn is supposed to stem the flow of refugees . Given enough American assistance , in other words , Haiti can be quickly reformed ; the Cuban regime , on the other hand , is beyond the pale and should be starved into collapse . <p> The belief that authoritarian countries such as Haiti are easier to reform than Communist countries like Cuba is not a new one . This doctrine was originally formulated by Jeane Kirkpatrick , Ronald Reagan 's forthright ambassador to the UN . She argued that authoritarian countries may be more brutal than Communist countries , because under Communism a thoroughgoing pacification of society has already occurred and little extra violence is needed to maintain fear . Yet , she continued , most dictators did not aspire to transform society and dominate every sphere of activity ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security police , generally leaving churches , private property , and commerce alone . <p> In practice , the world has turned out to be more complicated than that . It is true that both Chile after Augusto Pinochet and Argentina after Leopoldo Galtieri seem to have much better chances of building prosperous economies and stable democratic institutions than , say , Russia or Rumania . Life in South Korea  --  until recently a dictatorship  --  is preferable to life in North Korea , still a totalitarian state . Post-Franco Spain is doing better than post-Gorbachev Ukraine . <p> On the other hand , China , which was almost the definition of a totalitarian society , is in some senses a success story . While Russia may be in chaos , other Central and Eastern European societies managed not only to rebel against their leaders but to reform themselves as well . The post-Communist Czech Republic is more stable than post-authoritarian Philippines , Estonia has better prospects than Malawi , and Hungary 's democracy is firmer than Pakistan 's . And how do you classify countries like Poland and Burma , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And so , looking at Cuba and Haiti without the political scientist 's prejudices , it is obvious that totalitarian Cuba will be much easier to sort out than authoritarian Haiti . Cuba may be poor and oppressed , but at least its people are relatively well educated , largely urban , and , if the success of the Cuban exile community is any evidence , vigorously entrepreneurial . Its once-confident middle class is not entirely suppressed and may well bounce back the moment socialism is lifted from its shoulders . With the capital and business skills of the Cuban exile community , the country could be improved relatively quickly . Within a few years of Castro 's demise , his country could again be the most popular holiday resort in the region . With prosperity returning , a post-Castro Cuba could become stable and democratic . <p> Haiti , on the other hand , is like a patch of Rwanda deposited in the Caribbean . The only world records it holds are in wretchedness : one of the highest population densities , one of the highest illiteracy rates , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lowest life expectancies . With an average per-capita income of $440 , Haitians must see Cubans , whose average per-capita income hovers around $1,500 , as positively prosperous . Many Haitians make good once they come over to the United States , but their largely rural brethren back home are still mired in ignorance and magic . In a country where voodoo remains a potent political force and spells are more feared than legal writs , any " return to democracy " is pure wishful thinking . The best that Haiti can hope for is that its dictators are benevolent , but by all accounts this is not a good bet with the unstable Father Aristide , the deposed president whom Clinton is in the process of restoring . <p> As the Heritage Foundation points out in its recent , characteristically hard-headed paper on Haiti , it is not as if the United States had not made such efforts before . " Democracy , " wrote Woodrow Wilson in 1885 , " is not created by aspirations or by new faith ; it is built up by slow habit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fruit of youth : immature peoples can not have it , and the maturity to which it is vouchsafed is the maturity of freedom and self-control , and no other . " Unfortunately , Wilson did not listen to his own advice when thirty years later , as President , he sent the U.S. Marines to invade Haiti . He told a White House visitor that his purpose was " to teach the South American republics to elect good men , " a rationale strikingly similar to President Clinton 's official aim of " restoring democracy . " Just as today , democratic Haiti was to be propped up with the help of American-trained policemen and sanitation officials . Bill Clinton should remember how that effort to help Haiti fared . The quag mire , which lasted twenty years , cost hundreds of American and thousands of Haitian lives . And when the U.S. troops left in 1934 , the country remained as ungovernable as before . Each a Special Case <p> NONE OF THIS is to say that Communism was benevolent , or even that it was a lesser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every country is a special case , with its own traditions , institutions , national ethos , ethnic composition , industrial base , and , most of all , history . Communism was often imposed upon sophisticated cultures and could not entirely wreck their potential . On the other hand , authoritarian regimes rule some of the most primitive countries in the world and tend to destroy the few civilized institutions they find . The classification of regimes as either totalitarian or authoritarian fails to predict their post-despotic development . <p> So if America should not have sent troops to Haiti , what should America have done ? " If you do n't know what to do , " goes the Chinese saying , " do nothing . " Bill Clinton could do worse than to follow this maxim . It would be cheaper to plug illegal immigration from Mexico  --  where the numbers are greater  --  than to try to stabilize Haiti . The expense and loss of face that America has been incurring in keeping the refugees out are minuscule by comparison with the cost and humiliation if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Somalia . Nor is there any immediate need to do battle with Castro . With the collapse of the Soviet bloc , he is no longer the nuisance he used to be . The U.S. can simply firm up the patrols on its coast and leave both countries to their own devices , waiting to see whether regimes emerge that Washington can do business with . <p> By RADEK SIKORSKI <p> <p> Mr. Sikorski is NR 's roving correspondent . <p>
