The unstoppable Terry McMillan has a new home , a new man and new peace of ming and has just come out with a book . Is it any wonder one of the world 's best-selling authors is sitting so pretty ? // You could be in Pittsburgh or Dallas or Cleveland , but you happen to be just north of Detroit , where the people have discovered that Terry McMillan , author-liberator-diva , yes , the Terry McMillan , whose books sit near the Bible on probably more nightstands than you know and who gave birth to a whole industry known as Waiting to Exhale , is in town . Right now she 's through with those four exhaling broads , as she would call them , has moved to a new island of characters , and is about to read an excerpt to a hall full of fans . She 's leaning over the podium , sort of limp and lopsided , shifting from one leg to the other , and as she begins to say a few words to the worshipful , you notice that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bohemian , with her black leather jeans and a cap like the one Janet Jackson wore in her poet phase . The face itself is prettier , softer than that old picture on the Exhale jacket-the one of her with the texturized fade that a brother at a barber college in Oakland gave her like a century ago , which was " in " at the time but now is not and which is the main reason that perfect strangers still to this day come up to her and say things like " Girl , your pictures do n't do nothing for you . " The fade is gone now , replaced on this particular day with auburn braids , which before she begins to read she flings off her shoulders as if they are really in the way . " Whoever 's hair this is , " she says , flinging , and everybody breaks out laughing , because do n't they know it 's the truth , and Terry 's willing to say it if nobody else will . You just know that somebody in the audience is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brothers like that in the movie ? " and when they do , she 'll cock her head and look at you out of the corners of her eyes as if to say " It 's a movie , okay ? Get over it , " then actually say something wise if not foul , proudly foul , like her books . " First of all , men need to just grow up , " she will say . " Thank you , " a woman in the back will yell . " Usually the ones whining and complaining about male-bashing are the ones who 're doin ' all this s  --  , " the author-liberator-diva will say . " I deliberately chose men that women do n't need to be bringing home to their mamas . My question was , Why do we pick them ? " She 'll be ready for you . But first , she straightens herself as she begins to read-or should we say perform ? -a portion of her latest sermon , which basically says that life is short , so do what makes you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man young enough that you could 've given birth to him . She reads from How Stella Got Her Groove Back , her fourth novel and the first since her ubiquitous Waiting to Exhale made her the relationship queen , whether she wanted to be or not , and as one anthology put it , " one of the most popular and commercially successful Black writers of all time . " The passage she reads  --  about a 42-year-old Stella thinking unbiblical thoughts about a 21year-old man she has just met on a beach in Jamaica-sounds like you 're eavesdropping on the mind of your best girlfriend , and afterward you are treated to a steeping of McMillan 's womanist street theory that seems to come off the top of her head but probably comes from the life and observations of her 44 years . And you realize that you are watching a rough composite of Black womanhood-offbeat artist , your best girlfriend , wildly successful woman of the world looking for love and happiness , single mother who has just become aware that her young son , Solomon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more grateful that he is not yet too cool to ask her for a hug every night . And it occurs to you that she does not merely write books ; she seems the sum total of them . You realize that in the years since she has become famous and recognizable on the streets , made the covers of various Sunday supplements and been asked by strangers if she knew that she looks exactly like that Terry McMillan lady , she herself could be her own best character . There is not one , but there are , in fact , several Terry McMillans . One is the girl growing up in Port Huron , Michigan , who made decent grades , and who when she was 12 broke up a fight between her mother and stepfather by grabbing his knife and putting it to his throat . " How 's it feel now ? " she said . There is the Terry McMillan who went off to college at the University of California at Berkeley wanting to write , so she majored in journalism , took a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich suburb outside San Francisco , lived with a man who was n't especially good for her , did drugs and went to work high but kept her job somehow . There is the New York City Terry McMillan , who went to film school at Columbia , quit just short of her master 's because , she said , she and this African brother ( the only two Blacks in the class ) were not being treated right and set off to make it on her own in the writing world , rising at five in the morning to write before going to work-work being word processing at a law firm . She had a baby she named Solomon by a man she had been with for years but broke up with nine months after the baby came . But she did n't stop writing at dawn . She would take a red pen and edit what she wrote while riding on the subway to Manhattan , would put the finished version of what would become Mama into the computer and print it out on her lunch hour . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , The laser printer 's full of your s  --  , ' she says . " Everybody was on my side . " When the book was published in 1987 , she expected to go on a book tour like the White writers she read about . Her publisher told her it was n't happening . So she did it herself . She read up on how to become your own best publicity agent , typed up 3,000 letters to book dealers , book chains and college bookstores , telling the store owners she hoped they would order Mama . She taught Solomon , 3 by then , how to sponge the envelopes and throw them into a Macy 's shopping bag for her to mail off . She got enough requests for readings and book signings that it reached the point where she was sending her publisher 's staff her itinerary . Those were the same people , remember , who had told her she was not going on a book tour , whose dismissal just blew her away . " I said , This is , like , racism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tama Janowitz and all these White girls go on book tours for their first novel ? You saying their books are better than my book ? What 's so special about them ? ' Now my attitude is , Eat your f  --  ing hearts out . ' " Which brings us to the current Terry McMillan . She lives very , very well , as you know , wearing her Issey Miyake and Richard Tyler and outfitting her geometric new mansion with granite walls in seafoam and mustard , with the sauna and jacuzzi and pool , of course , with everything sunken or platform , which means you are always stepping down or up , with the eggplant-colored leather floor in her office , and at the front door the words We Think We Know , the whole effect being like jazz if jazz were three-dimensional . The current Terry McMillan has been off drugs and alcohol for years ( orders a virgin margarita these days ) , exercises , quit smoking too . You 're rooting for her because she 's been through it all-lived it for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , people still call and ask her for money , especially when graduation time rolls around ( " Well , you know Felicia 's doing good in school ... " ) . Naturally , her first gifts were for her mother-a new house , a Lexus and " a mouthful of new teeth . " The main man in her life all these years is now 12 . And McMillan , like other mothers , is starting to notice things , like piles of stuff on the floor in Solomon 's room and excuses as to why they are not put away . " Do n't let me come home and see things growing in different parts of the house , " she 'll chide him . She and Solomon are a team . She carted him to the Rockies , where she taught at the University of Wyoming and wrote Disappearing Acts , before she took him to Tucson to teach fiction at the University of Arizona , saying , " Solomon , we going to the desert ! " and he excitedly went . There she wrote Exhale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mom , have I told you how beautiful you are today ? " he 'll say . " Then I just smack him upside the head , " cause he 's lying , " McMillan says . " I 'll say , Okay , what do you want now ? ' " Photograph The author with her son , Solomon , and her current love , Jonathan Plummer . The magic happened on vacation in Jamaica . // Life was fine until 1993 when the worst thing that can happen to a daughter happened to Terry McMillan . Her mother , for whom she 'd grabbed a knife out of a man 's hand , who dressed Terry up in Jonathan Logan dresses even when she could n't afford to and taught her that when things get rough you can always leave because , after all , she had married and left her share of men-well , she died that October . McMillan was on a book tour in Rome , had just found a pair of Italian leather shoes to buy her mother , and was in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they had done all they could . It was asthma . The next year she lost her best friend , Doris Jean Austin , a writer she knew from New York . When she started making big money , she used to send DorisJean a check every month to help her pay the bills . One day , after months of various things going wrong and McMillan telling her to go to the doctor , DorisJean told her she had liver cancer , that it was terminal , beyond chemo . McMillan 's reaction was to help Austin live it up for whatever time she had left . " Doris , we going on a shopping spree , honey , " Terry told her . " Henri Bendel 's . Tiffany 's . Doris loved Tiffany 's , honey . Any f  --  ing place you wan na go , ' I told her . You wan na go to London ? You wan na go to Paris ? You wan na go to Africa ? Anywhere you wan na go . I 'm not kidding . You know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okay ? ' " That was on a Wednesday . The following Saturday , Doris died . " I could n't talk or move , " McMillan says . Thus began a drought where she did not feel like writing , could n't finish the book she was working on , A Day Late and a Dollar Short , still hoping her mother and Doris would come back , or at least call . So last summer she went to Jamaica by herself . She met a man , a young man , let 's not say how young , she says . Okay , let 's say he 's in his twenties , she says , because it 's not about age anyway . He 's six four , big eyes , name is Jonathan , did n't know she was a big-time author . They hit it off right away . She wondered if she 'd lost her mind . He did n't seem to care . Her friends could see the difference when she got back home . " All my friends were like , Terry , girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McMillan remembers . " Send that motherf  --  er a ticket . Get his ass up here " cause we ai n't seen you look like this in years . You look younger . You got a little pep in your voice . F  --  what anybody else says , " cause , girl , this is your life . ' " So she brought him to California to live with her and Solomon and their dog , Timber , last October . She says she was trying to be realistic . For one thing , she says , her body does not look like Patra 's or those girls ' in TLC anymore , although it does n't seem to matter much to him , and besides , he 's just now experiencing life , taking college classes and all . " I said , Jonathan , the chances of there being a picket fence and us walking down the aisle are slim . Let 's face it . ' " But she ca n't stop smiling when she talks about him , twisting her braids like she 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rub me on my head like I 'm a little kid , you know , " she says , " or like if I bump my arm and say Ouch , ' he 'll put his head up against my forehead and his hands on my head and he 'll just say Hush . ' Then he 'll put his arms around me , and I mean there 's something really comforting about that , and he does it a lot . I 'm almost on the verge where I 'm ready to bump into s  --  on purpose . " Furthermore , she says , he 's good with Solomon , and that matters a lot . As for the age difference , she says , it 's nobody 's business , and hey , what about all the men with girls who could be their granddaughters ? " Hugh Hefner is having babies at 60-girlfriend barely graduated from high school , " she says . Who cares , anyway ? By midwinter , things were going well enough that McMillan was actually flirting with the idea of having another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she mentioned getting her tubes tied one day , and Jonathan said he did n't think she should do that just yet . Then her editor sent a numerology reading predicting she might have a baby this year . You can see her rolling her eyes . " If I had a child now , I would be its grandmother , " she said . " It would come out and say Hi , Granny . ' " Then Jonathan 's mother asked about children : " For the next few days I was sort of consumed by the whole thought , " she says . " Could I even get pregnant at this age ? How would my life change ? I mean , I 'm not married to this man . I might . I do n't know . Not that it would matter to me . Sort of . But I just started thinking , like wow , what if I got pregnant like next week ? I 've had 44 years . I recovered from Solomon . I can still wear my two-piece bathing suit . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like , how old would I be when it was in kindergarten , and would I be alive when it graduated from high school ? " She decided that if it happened , it would be a message from God , and who was she to pick a fight with Him ? It was around the time that Jonathan moved to California that she started writing again , first a poem , then a fullfledged novel about taking chances and breaking out . In a matter of weeks , Stella was born . You would have to be crazy not to see that McMillan and Stella have a few things in common-like Jamaica , beach , man . But McMillan does n't like talking about where she ends and Stella begins , except to say that while this is fiction , a fantasy , she likes to say it is truer to life than her other books . " When people say , how close is this to your real life , I 'm just going to say Very close , ' " she said while still editing the book . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . " What she also will admit is that in her own life something magical happened : " I was walking on that beach in Jamaica , like on the third or fourth day , after I 'd spent this time with Jonathan , and we danced and all this stuff . And inside of me , it was like this music was playing . Inside me , my entire being was singing . As I was walking along the beach , I said , Mama , you did this , did n't you ? ' I said it out loud . Then my cheeks started hurting because I was trying not to laugh , and I was giggling and stuff . And that 's when I started thinking , particularly when I got home , Mama sent him to me , because this is the first time since she 's been gone that I felt like myself . Like the person I really am . I think my mother said , It 's time .
