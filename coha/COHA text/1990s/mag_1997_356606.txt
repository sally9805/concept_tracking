Singapore : Raffles Hotel , early 1942 . The colonial swells are having a party  --  black ties , a ricky-ticky dance band lulling them with torpid tunes . As they swill their bubbly , they mutter contempt for the advancing Japanese army in smug racist terms . <P> Do n't these folks know they 're fox-trotting on the edge of a volcano ? No , of course not . They never do . But we do . We 've been partying with their heedless ilk on the eve of disaster since we started going to the movies . We know that when the pretty girl and the handsome lad start moonily planning their future , the crump-crump-crump of an artillery barrage is but a moment away . <P> We also know that we are in for a very long day 's journey on writer-director Bruce Beresford 's endlessly predictable Paradise Road . Do we know that the ship carrying the women and children to safety as Singapore surrenders will be sunk , Red Cross markings or not ? Can we predict that the well-spoken Japanese officer some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will turn out to be a sadist ? When the commandant of the camp where they 're interned appears , are we not instantly certain he studied penology with Colonel Saito over on the River Kwai ? <P> And we 're just getting started . We have much familiar hardship and vile torment to go . Not to mention the inevitable triumph of the human spirit . One day Adrienne Pargiter ( Glenn Close ) and Margaret Drummond ( Pauline Collins ) get to humming the theme from a symphony . The former once studied music seriously ; the latter is a missionary who knows how inspiring a good tune can be when you 're in the dumps . Or trying to survive in one . Soon enough the prisoners form a symphonic chorus , which sings wordless versions of great orchestral works . Even the more selfish and cynical prisoners  --  among them recent Academy Award winner Frances McDormand , rather miscast as a Viennese Jewish doctor  --  register awe and wonder at this feat . <P> We are assured that this all really happened . Survivors have imparted their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist and are used in the movie . But in shaping their tale for the screen , should n't he have honored their courage  --  and , yes , inventiveness  --  with something other than cliches ? <P>  --  By Richard Schickel
