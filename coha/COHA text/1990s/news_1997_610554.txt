<p> THE WEEKEND began early but not well . I had been in Los Angeles only since Tuesday , and after a business dinner Thursday night at a new club with a loud country-rock band , I was still seriously jet-lagged . The valet parking was six bucks . Around midnight , in hopes of getting some sleep before the early-morning flight home , I left half-finished the only cigar I 'd been able to enjoy all week . <p> In the morning , happy to leave , I made the mistake of actually getting on the plane  --  and what was supposed to be a five-hour flight took eight , delivering me to Dulles in a mood for homicide . Not the " must-see TV " kind . <p> Fortunately , my wife , Marianne , picked me up at the airport ; as planned , we drove about eight miles to the outskirts of Leesburg and pulled into what appeared , at night , to be a corporate park but was in fact a hotel and conference center where we 'd booked a special weekend-package room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the free valet parking ; then he unloaded the car and inquired , straight-faced , if we had splurged on a room with hot running water . His demeanor immediately took the edge off the airplane ride and helped us get into a better frame of mind for dinner . <p> The best thing about Lansdowne Resort , which daylight confirms as looking like a corporate park  --  although one with a golf course designed by Robert Trent Jones Jr .  --  is that it is only 25 minutes from the Beltway on Route 7 west . What counted for a lot , and particularly after a bad week , was that everyone was friendly and wanted to help . What also counted is that the place is near historic Leesburg and some of Virginia 's prettiest country . What counted most of all was that you can smoke a cigar in a lot of places around Lansdowne . <p> After sleeping late Saturday morning , Marianne and I set out in search of espresso and Leesburg 's annual August Court Days celebration , a street fair that inspires some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Particularly amusing were " Lord Foppington " and his maiden aunt , who , the program promised , " will charm you with their authentic arrogance while they remind you of your inferior social position . " Marianne and I strolled the center of Leesburg , and were keen to learn that at the Loudoun County Courthouse on Aug. 12 , 1776 , the Declaration of Independence " was read from the doorway . " Today , you can look opposite the courthouse and see Payne 's Biker Bar , with a sign advising that you are " Better off here than across the street . " Another sign , at 105 W. Loudoun St. , notes that " On this site in 1897 Nothing Happened . " <p> Exploring the town , we found the Leesburg Emporium cigar store . I was more than pleasantly surprised to find that the store 's humidor stocked the very brand I had abandoned in Los Angeles . This cigar had just recently come on the market and I was happy to buy one of each of the three shapes available . <p> After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 to Oatlands Plantation , where long ago they grew wheat . Oatlands is owned these days by the National Trust for Historic Preservation and has a past full of Washingtoniana . I took a 30-minute tour of the house , and while Marianne boldly submitted to the two-hour package ( which included the grounds ) , I sat on a bench under a shag-bark hickory tree in front of the carriage house , smoked my newly acquired Dominican robusto and read the paper . Afterward we returned to Lansdowne with the idea of working out in the state-of-the-art fitness room . <p> I ended up watching the Orioles game , which finished just in time for my pre-dinner massage and swim . <p> On Sunday , after a huge buffet breakfast , we made the 35-minute drive to Harpers Ferry , W.Va. , bought ice cream , and walked along the Shenandoah River after touring the historic buildings and relearning the tragic stories of John Brown 's raid and the plight of slaves just before the Civil War . By the time we got back to the hotel , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We had heard radio ads for Lansdowne Resort , but had found no reason to spend the weekend there until I got an invitation to spend $ 99 at the hotel 's first-ever cigar dinner ( a second one is planned for this summer ) . And it was , for four hours in the hotel 's Pavilion , a celebration of testosterone . The menu included a rather tasty farm-raised , jerk-style alligator ; a juicy , roast wild boar ; and a less interesting smoked leg of boar . It also included four Davidoff cigars , Old Dominion wheat beer and after-dinner fly-fishing lessons from expert Mark Kovach on a lighted tennis court . <p> The highlight of my evening , however , was when John Hayes , the owner of John B. Hayes Tobacco in Fairfax and the dinner 's co-sponsor , gave me what is arguably the best cigar now being made : an Arturo Fuente Opus X corona . Thus the anxiety that had consumed me 48 hours earlier was finally lifted into the warm Virginia air on curls of super-premium smoke . <p> WAYS &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 44050 Woodridge Pky. , Leesburg , 1-800-541-4801 or 703-729-8400 ) is about a half-hour from the Beltway , west on Route 7 . You can also take the Dulles Toll Road west to Route 28 north for five miles , then Route 7 west for 3.5 miles . From Los Angeles , get on a plane to Dulles Airport and follow the directions for Route 28 . <p> Lansdowne has all the modern conveniences and more . General rates start at $ 109 , but the basic " Weekend Getaway Package " offers double-occupancy , breakfast and unlimited use of the health club for $ 74 a person per night . Other deals include the " Hole-in-One Package " ( room , 18 holes of golf with unlimited driving range privileges and breakfast for $ 134 per person ) and the " Romance Package " ( room , dinner and breakfast in bed for $ 258 per couple ) . Call for special events and other packages . <p> As for another cigar dinner , the resort is planning one for this summer , but details have n't been finalized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're not eating at Lansdowne , get a massage , a pedicure , a manicure and  --  did I mention a massage ? A half-hour therapeutic hands-on session is $ 35 , one hour is $ 60 . Through March , you can play golf for $ 55 every day . Out of the hotel , there is plenty to do in and around Leesburg . On Sundays , about 12 miles from Leesburg , there is a flea market in the town of Aldie on U.S. 50 . Everything from antiques to junk is available , or you can spend a lot of time looking at old prints and magazine ads at the Rare Print Wagon ( 540-364-3671 ) , which is here whenever it 's not at a bigger convention . <p> Oatlands Plantation ( on U.S. 15 six miles south of Leesburg , 703-777-3174 ) opens for the season March 29 . Tours are 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. , Monday-Saturday , 1 to 4:40 p.m . Sundays . Admission is $ 6 . <p> WHERE TO EAT : We had dinner at Lansdowne every night . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be , but the salmon was better than the ribeye , though the best item was the garlic mashed potatoes . The Riverside Hearth has a menu complemented by a buffet and a dessert table . The mussel bisque and the grilled shrimp and lobster in a light tomato-basil sauce over orzo were the best dishes we had all weekend . The desserts are not generally worth the calories . The buffet breakfast on Sunday morning was full of enough good choices that we happily skipped lunch . Outside the hotel there are the usual chain restaurants and fast-food joints ; one spot worth trying is Tuscarora Mill at the Market Station complex on Harrison and Loudoun streets in Leesburg . Try the buffalo burger . <p> WHERE TO GET A CIGAR : Cigars are available at Lansdowne in the pro shop or the bar , Stonewalls , but do n't bother getting them there unless you 're out and it 's late . Either bring your own or visit Cliff Wollard at the Leesburg Emporium ( 540-777-5557 ) at Market Station . <p> INFORMATION : For activities in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
