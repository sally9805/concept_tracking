<p> ST . PETERSBURG , Fla. - On opening day 1993 , Mark Ferguson was offering beer and a sad tale from the barkeep 's post at Ferg 's Sports Bar &; Grill . <p> He got more takers on the tale . <p> Some 200 miles to the southeast , Charlie Hough was pitching for a fevered crowd at the Florida Marlins ' inaugural game . Some 500 yards out Ferg 's back door , St. Petersburg 's $ 138 million ThunderDome stood silent testament to the hard-learned lesson that all the pitching , hand-squeezing and shoulder-rubbing in the world wo n't bring a major-league baseball team to town . <p> The only crowd in Ferg 's toted notebooks and television cameras . They were the reporters assigned to cover the losers in Florida that day , even though the scorebooks show the Los Angeles Dodgers fell 6-3 to the Marlins . " That could have been the greatest day of my life , " said Ferguson , a baseball-loving St. Petersburg schoolteacher who on a gamble converted a gas station into the sports bar four years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the cameras . " <p> At the time , some called Ferguson a fool and the city officials who approved the Dome - financed by tax dollars and completed in 1990 - careless spenders . <p> " To the city it ( the Dome ) represented failure and frustration , " St. Petersburg Mayor David Fischer said . " Our taxes were exceptionally high . The people were exhausted . " <p> When the cameras finally returned to Ferg 's three months ago , they found relief and revelry . The announcement the Tampa Bay area , along with Phoenix , would have an expansion team beginning in 1998 brought the doubters and dreamers alike to celebrate in the shadow of the Dome , which will be home to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays . <p> " It was so busy , " Ferguson said , " I could n't even drink a beer . " <p> The town toasted the consummation of an 18-year courtship with major-league baseball , one that had attracted long-standing criticism , long-suffering fans , and long lists of interested investors and interested teams . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put together a special baseball section every time a deal seemed close . The only one that made it to newsstands , on March 10 , was the fourth . The cover simply declared " Finally . " <p> " The weight that was lifted off the shoulders of our city was enormous , " Fischer said . <p> The first pitch has yet to be thrown in the Dome , the first home run yet to be hit , the first error yet to be made . Tampa Bay , though , has baseball tradition - not the stuff of spring training , which has been in the area since 1915 - but tradition of a different sort , most of it embattled and bitter . The players , everyone seems sure , will change the course of that history . <p> " Tampa , more than one time , was used as a pawn in securing new stadiums or improving situations in other cities , " said Houston infielder Dave Magadan , a Tampa native . " But we stuck it out . <p> " It was a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Since 1978 , Tampa Bay has been trying to lure a major-league team . Over the years , the persistent trolling of investors brought tangos and tangles with the Minnesota Twins , Oakland A 's , Chicago White Sox , Texas Rangers , Seattle Mariners and San Francisco Giants . <p> " Everyone who worked for this , when we got the team , went from boobs to visionaries overnight , " Fischer said . <p> A group of investors named the Tampa Bay Baseball Group bought 42 percent of the Twins in 1984 . They planned to move the team south but later sold the interest to a Minneapolis banker for no profit , reportedly at the request of MLB officials interested in saving baseball in Minnesota . <p> A more serious bid took shape in 1986 , when White Sox officials said they would leave Comiskey Park in 1990 and move out of Illinois unless legislators approved a new stadium . In July 1986 the St. Petersburg City Council , in an unpopular decision , voted to build the Dome . <p> Council members found their cars spray-painted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tied to the decision . Fischer was elected on a platform that included promises to negotiate airtight leases at the stadium . <p> By June 30 , 1988 , when Illinois legislators faced a midnight deadline for approving a new Comiskey Park , the city of St. Petersburg had drawn up a preliminary 30-year lease for the White Sox at the Dome . Tampa Bay residents tuned in to that night 's Illinois legislative session , delirious when it appeared there were n't enough votes to keep the team in Illinois , deflated when 11th-hour politicking created the necessary count - 60-55 in favor of building a new Comiskey . <p> A brief flirtation with the Rangers later that year resulted in nothing , but when the National League committed in 1989 to a two-team expansion , Tampa Bay again brought out the bait . Three investment groups emerged and the Dome - then named the Florida Suncoast Dome - was ready for dog-and-pony shows . <p> The serious pursuit took one brief pause . In March 1991 , the N.L. expansion committee requested a tryout of sorts at the Dome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fly ball against the gleaming white of the Dome 's cap and the blue of the infield seats . <p> With a lineup of league suits and the city 's suitors watching , John Vukovich popped a fly to Von Hayes . Hayes shuffled , squinted , then ducked and covered his head with his glove . The ball landed next to him . <p> " You could have heard a pin drop , " said Bill Boggs , marketing manager for the Dome . " Then Vukovich turned around and said , ' Just kidding . " ' <p> St. Petersburg again worked out a stadium lease and harbored hope until days before the N.L. 's decision , when key Tampa Bay investors reduced their financial commitment . The expansion teams went instead to Colorado and to South Florida , where Blockbuster executive H. Wayne Huizenga had dug into his deep pockets and his equally deep reserve of business savvy to land the Marlins . <p> For Tampa Bay residents , watching South Florida embrace baseball was like watching your date leave a dance with one of your friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another line . <p> This time investors , including Tampa-based businessman Vince Naimoli , headed to Seattle , where the Mariners owner was having money troubles and wanted to sell . Prospects were promising , since the only other offer came from a group led by Japanese-owned Nintendo Co . Baseball seemed unlikely to approve a sale to foreign investors . <p> Yet , a year after the expansion letdown , the Mariners went to the Nintendo-led group . The Tampa Bay group went home empty-handed but not empty of hope . <p> Giants owners announced soon after they would sell to the first group that made a reasonable offer . Naimoli and others flew to San Francisco with an offer of $ 115 million . <p> At the urging of N.L. president Bill White , investors in San Francisco made counter offers , all lower than Naimoli 's . If economics ruled , Tampa Bay would have a team . But baseball ruled . The Giants stayed in San Francisco . <p> The stunning decision left scars , some still on display . <p> At Ferg 's Sports Bar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memorabilia that decorates the walls . <p> Four blocks west of the Dome , in an industrial district , a mural stretches around the four outside walls of a warehouse . The mural depicts a baseball field , with broad base paths and a lush infield , surrounded by corn stalks . Painted on top of a pedestal in the field of dreams is a Giant-sized glove , the name " Barry Bonds " scrawled on its surface . <p> Tampa Bay was left to breed its own heroes . The area found one in Naimoli . <p> " I could n't go to a shopping mall or anywhere else without someone telling me to stick with it , " Naimoli said . <p> Naimoli filed lawsuits - one against the city of San Francisco , another against the San Francisco bidders and yet another that would allow him to sue baseball . But when the possibility of expansion again arose , Naimoli delayed his lawsuits . Tampa Bay delayed its enthusiasm . <p> " We 're a city that had been to the altar so many times that we became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confident until five minutes before the press conference . " <p> The announcement came March 9 at 12:53 p.m. , by the clock at Ferg 's . While the rest of the baseball world felt like losers by virtue of the strike going on at the time , Tampa Bay finally was a winner . <p> " I had faith , " Ferguson said . " I always did .
