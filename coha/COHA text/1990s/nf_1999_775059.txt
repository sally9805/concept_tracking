The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were crunched over a thousand conference tables as another family decided , " That 's enough , " and cities continued to slide down the population tables . Maybe you 've heard of cities as the hole in the doughnut . Or maybe you 've heard of chocolate cities and vanilla suburbs . Perhaps you 've heard a recent speaker of the House denounce the cities as parasitic bodies living off their hardworking American host . // They now speak with an accent . Their plaster is shot . Their windows rattle in the sash . We eat in their restaurants , wondering if the car is safe . We listen to their symphonies and regret that long drive home . We remember a million years in ten million childhoods . We feel a mixture of sadness , nostalgia , and relief when we take that final turn and swing onto the freeway entrance ramp . We head home : to a place where we can choose our neighbors. // When you talk about the city , the conversation ends with an exasperated litany . In the city , the kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more of our taxes to pay for their crumbling buildings , and to pay the salaries of the members of the teacher 's unions . Violent young men commit random acts of mayhem . The cities satisfy America 's craving for drugs , cheap labor , and expensive entertainment . In front of the late TV news we shake our heads in disgust over their comically corrupt politics , goofball racial agitators , and the parade of black and brown suspects into the back of squad cars . // Starting in 1945 , one of the Great Migrations of American history took place , and it continues to shape the country to this day , politically , economically , and socially . Unlike the nineteenth-century flow of Conestoga wagons through the Cumberland Gap and on to the West , and unlike the early-twentieth-century black migration from the Jim Crow South to the urban North , this was a choreographed combination of mini-migrations : white migrants left the old neighborhood behind and left the very idea of " neighborhoods " behind . They left the old giants - New York , Philadelphia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Pittsburgh , Cleveland , Buffalo , and St. Louis . While the settlers a century ago , and blacks earlier this century , left all that was familiar to start again in a strange new world , these modern migrants sometimes headed just a little past the city line . Their old world was not " gone " but now just a car ride away . But the force of each small journey combined to slam the old cities of America like a hurricane . While those earlier migrations survive in family stories and fading photographs , this last one lives vividly in present memory . Maybe you or your parents were part of it .... // Nostalgia , mixed with geographic proximity and racial resentment , creates a toxic potion . The pioneers of the postwar urban migration are convinced there was once a better city than the one we see today . We know there was because we used to live there . The old city lives on in the speeches of politicians and in flickering black-and-white reruns on a hundred cable channels . There 's Chester Riley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lou Costello . And Mrs. Goldberg . Urbanites all . They walk to the grocery store . They know their neighbors . They may have even walked to church ( or shul ) . // It 's not hard to get people to tell the stories of that good , gone life . In Cleveland 's Buckeye neighborhood . In Philadelphia 's Mantua on the west bank of the Schuylkill River . In Miami 's Opa-Locka and the Grand Concourse in the Bronx . Back on Ninety-first Street in Chicago . Maybe you lived there . You may even drive by every now and then . Or maybe you find you want to less and less . It does n't look like the place where you stood after your first Holy Communion , hair slicked into place , smiling through the gaps in your teeth . // There was constant talk during those years : Who was going ?

Some are bathed in sepia , others filled with " begats , " like an Old Testament book . The alibis are short , starting with , " Well , you know , " and ending with " the schools , " " the crime , " or " the neighborhood . " Where does folktale stop and reality begin ? Now that the damage is done , and the cities are hollowed out , it still matters enough to you to point fingers , though you may not always be sure you 're pointing them in the right directions . Can you assign culpability to a crime with ten million accomplices ? // The year 1950 was the last full cry of urban America , at least on the surface . It was the year many of the cities visited in this book reached their historic peaks in population . Everybody was working , in folk memory , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at quitting time or watched as the next shift filed in . Houses cost a couple of thousand bucks , or in high-cost cities some fifteen thousand . The mortgage was often less than a hundred a month . The teeming ethnic ghettos of the early century had given way to a more comfortable life , with religion and ethnicity , race and class still used as organizing principles for the neighborhood . The rough edges of the immigrant " greenhorns " were worn smooth , and a confident younger generation now entered a fuller , richer American life . Grandma and Grandpa had their accents and old ways intact , and still mumbled sayings in the language your parents used when they did n't want you to understand . You could still find Il Progresso , Freiheit , Norske Tidende , and Polish Daily Zgoda on the newsstands , but the neighborhoods themselves were no longer alien places . It was the ghetto , yes , but made benign by assimilation . // It was this world that the first surge tide into the suburbs left behind . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making Americans out of families from Dublin to Donetsk . America had given the urban young educations , and expectations . For many , those expectations had been nurtured through world war and economic depression . Something better was needed for the baby boomers. // Charles and Anne Marie Manelli both grew up in St. Louis neighborhoods . When they came back to the Midwest from a stint in Denver , young son in tow , they headed right back to Anne Marie 's neighborhood on the far north side , not far from the city line , and now found something lacking . " I do n't think we would have stayed in the city even if we could have found a big enough house on the same block where we were living , " Anne Manelli says . " We wanted change . The neighborhood was getting older , though I guess at that time it was n't really that old , maybe twenty-five years old or so . " // Charles Manelli recalls the spirit of the times . " People our age at that time all wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses available in the city of St. Louis . So they all moved , and bought homes out in the county . The city was really emptying out quickly at that time . So sure , there were houses , but they were not the houses that the young people would have wanted . There was a lot of old real estate in the city , and the new subdivisions was where the young people wanted to go . // " We bought our first home on the GI Bill , that 's the way everyone was going then . You had two bathrooms , three bedrooms , it was different . And you could buy these houses for twenty thousand dollars , eighteen thousand dollars . That 's what the young people wanted . They did n't want the big brick bungalows . " // The Manellis were not alone .

In 1950 , the populations of New York , Chicago , Philadelphia , Washington , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Baltimore reached their historic highs . Some , like Detroit , Pittsburgh , St. Louis , and Cleveland , would soon enter free fall , shrinking by 50 percent or more .

Washington and St. Louis were already showing the early signs of their long , slow declines , while their metropolitan areas grew , and towns once little more than names on a map began to grow with increasing speed .

Fortune 500 corporate headquarters continued their steady flight from the city . New Yorkers left for other regions of the country and for the burgeoning suburbs of northern New Jersey , Westchester County , and Nassau and Suffolk counties , which the census bureau would soon classify as a separate metropolitan statistical area - no longer an appendage of the city . The economic decline of New York 's bread-and-butter industries , like clothing , printing , and shipping , landed heavily on all New Yorkers . The poor saw themselves as stuck . The rich could surround themselves with physical barriers , continuing to live a charmed life in a declining city .
