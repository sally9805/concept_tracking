As bird populations decline , national parks are islands of protection along migratory routes <p> SPRING CREEK emerges quietly from some generous subterranean source , in a pond on the margins of Minnesota 's St. Croix River Valley . Then the water picks up speed as it tumbles over an old dam , and you begin to hear it . A pleasant sound , perhaps , but disturbing for research zoologist Richard Weisbrod . So is the lilting clarity of the occasional birdsong . <p> " I was raised in this part of the world , " he says . " Twenty years ago , you could n't distinguish a Baltimore oriole from an ovenbird . It was a cacophony of avian vocalizations . Now , at mid-morning in the middle of May , you can even hear the stream . And there are no thrushes . There ought to be all sorts of thrushes here . " <p> The dozens of bird species that migrate to or through the St. Croix National Scenic Riverway from Latin America each spring should be thriving . Part of the national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habitat . <p> But Weisbrod 's lament is not just misplaced nostalgia . Reports of the decline or disappearance of migratory bird populations have been accumulating from widely scattered areas across the country . The phenomenon is not restricted to shore and wetland species and majestic birds of prey , many of them recognized as rare or threatened for decades . Now the species reported as scarce or missing from areas where they were formerly abundant are songbirds , familiar even to the casual backyard observer : orioles , tanagers , warblers , flycatchers , redstarts . <p> Several factors have made scientists cautious about sounding an alarm , however , and some still call the evidence inconclusive . For one thing , bird populations can change dramatically from year to year , even under normal conditions . Without reliable , continuous data collected over many years-20 years is an accepted minimum-who could say whether the reported declines were within the realm of natural variation ? <p> But new research has led to a growing scientific consensus : population declines among many migratory species are real , abnormal , severe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University ornithologist Sidney Gauthreaux reported on his preliminary comparison of radar images of the massive bird migrations across the Gulf of Mexico . The numbers staggered some of his colleagues : the density of the flocks had dropped by half over the past 20 years . <p> A recent analysis of data collected in the North American Breeding Bird Survey ( BBS ) shows declines of 6 to 78 percent among a score of migrant land bird species , just from 1978 to 1987 . But to talk about extinctions in these species is premature , according to U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service ornithologist Sam Droege , one of the study 's authors . " The gist of our paper is to say , ' Watch out-where will the bottom line be ? We do n't know where the situation will end . ' " <p> Droege and his co-authors say their data strongly implicate the rapid deforestation of Mexico and Central and South America-crucial habitat for many migrants . <p> Other scientists argue that forest fragmentation in our own country is a more significant factor in the declines , partly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fragmented woods also afford far less protection from predators and from parasitic birds that prefer forest edges . <p> Before proposing action , scientists would prefer to sort out the relative importance of these environmental changes and track population shifts among a long list of migrant species , especially those most threatened . <p> That process is still in its infancy , however , and time may be short . The BBS , so far the best source of data , is " wide , but shallow , " says Purdue ecologist Kerry Rabenold . It consists of bird counts made by volunteers who have driven more than 2,000 different prescribed routes around the U.S. and Canada each summer since 1966 . <p> " I distrust its ability to detect declines in species we 're most concerned about , " he says . " It 's a roadside survey , so it would n't get at deep-forest species , which are in the greatest peril . And the survey ca n't cope , statistically , with the low numbers of rarer species to see how bad the declines really are . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a team of students rolled out of bed at 4:30 a.m. each day during the 1990 breeding season to cross-check the accuracy of the BBS with other techniques and to look for ways that it might be modified for use in the park system . <p> They are part of a grassroots effort called the Migratory Bird Watch , slowly growing within the Park Service , whose organizers hope to build an international monitoring and conservation network . Administrators in each park have been invited to set up the essential long-term bird counts and to establish symbolic " linkages " with other parks to focus attention on the migrants . <p> The " linkages " are an interpretive device to remind park visitors of the interdependence of the hemisphere 's natural preserves . Blackpoll warblers and eastern wood-pewees , for example , breed in Acadia National Park , Maine , and pass through the Everglades during their migratory cycles . The olive-sided flycatcher and Townsend 's warbler link Mount Rainier in Washington and Arizona 's Chiricahua National Monument , which they pass through on their way south for the winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connections extend on southward , to the rest of the ' hemisphere . <p> " I think the key is raising awareness among the American public that protecting and preserving those birds , which we take for granted , is dependent on international cooperation , " says Richard Cunningham , chief interpreter for the Park Service 's western region . <p> So far , administrators at about a dozen national parks have incorporated the Migratory Bird Watch into their research and interpretive programs . But a proposal to extend it to all suitable national park areas , and an initiative to foster cooperative efforts in Latin American countries , has attracted scant support among decision-makers in the upper echelons of the park system . <p> Though their land mass is too tiny to afford real protection , the national parks have a crucial role to play in future bird research , scientists say . The parks provide a baseline for comparison with other , less protected areas-essential in attempts to explain what is happening to the migrants . Yet today very little is known about the size and health of bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Wildlife Service is getting religion about doing that kind of basic monitoring , " Rabenold says , " and the Park Service is , too , to a lesser degree . " <p> ABOUT HALF THE BIRDS in the national parks are long-distance migrants . Of some 650 bird species that breed in North America , Cunningham points out , 332 migrate beyond the boundaries of the U.S. Though we may think of them as " our birds , " they spend two-thirds of their lives on the migratory journey and on their southern wintering grounds . Migration routes can stretch thousands of miles , from Amazonia to the Arctic , but the largest numbers of birds winter in Central America and the Caribbean islands . <p> The wood thrush , for example , inhabits lowland rainforests from southern Mexico to Panama during the winter season . Its breeding range extends roughly across the eastern half of the U.S. Robin-sized , feathered mostly in shades of brown , the wood thrush is not one , of the more eye-catching migrants , but its song is among the sweetest . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Nature is in her spring , " Thoreau wrote . " Wherever he hears it , it is a new world and a free country , and the gates of heaven are not shut against him . " <p> Wood thrush populations are falling fast-about 30 percent in just ten years , according to the BBS study . <p> Smithsonian biologist John Rappole sees thrushes during spring and summer research in Virginia 's Shenandoah National Park , and , during the winter , in Mexico 's Tuxtla Mountains Biosphere Preserve . That nobly named area , however , is a preserve only on paper . " We started work there in 1973 , " he says . " Since that time the amount of forest has declined from 30 percent to 15 percent , replaced by pasture . There are no wood thrushes in pasture areas . " <p> Population pressure in Mexico and throughout Latin America drives subsistence farmers farther and farther into the rainforest , where they log areas unsuited for farming . " You 're talking about slopes of 45 degrees , rainfall of 160 inches a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a field . There is n't much forest left ; at some point they 're going to run out , and they 're still going to be facing the same problems . It 's a situation that ca n't go on . " Furthermore , once cleared , rainforests do not regenerate . Current estimates of the rate of destruction of tropical forests throughout Latin America range from one to 3.5 percent per year and possibly higher . <p> Neither is the wood thrush 's summer habitat , north of the border , secure against threats . Cowbird populations have reportedly swollen in many areas , including the Rocky Mountains , where larger forests have been split up into smaller patches . An edge-dwelling parasite , the cowbird lays eggs in the nests of other species , sometimes destroying the eggs of the host bird . Any survivors face tough competition , as the big cowbird chicks usually hatch earlier , grow faster , and eat more of the food provided by their " adoptive " parents . <p> In the fragmented woods around Lake Shelbyville , Illinois , an important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that cowbirds had parasitized 80 percent of the nests of all other species . In wood thrush nests , cowbird eggs outnumbered thrush eggs four to one . The thrushes were doing little but raising cowbirds , researcher Scott Robinson found . <p> National parks afford more protection , but Rappole 's research shows how park management practices can alter the balance of survival for any species . Songbirds like the wood thrush , for example , breed in just the kind of greenery that is eaten by deer . In Shenandoah and many other national parks , Rappole says , deer populations are now about ten times their natural density . The timber wolves and mountain lions that kept deer populations in check before human settlement have not been reintroduced . " The deer just clean out the understory , " he says . " It looks , from the ground level to four feet , like somebody 's gone through with clippers . " <p> TO AVOID PREDATORS or starvation , long-distance migrants depend on healthy ecosystems in two places , usually thousands of miles apart . But to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real drama of their survival . <p> " The experience that has moved me more than anything else , " says Ted Simons , research biologist at Gulf Islands National Seashore , " has been watching these birds appear after they have flown 15 to 24 hours or more , non-stop , across the Gulf . They weigh only eight to 12 grams , and they have flown five or six hundred miles . " <p> Some stumble aimlessly , so tired they are willing even to be picked up in human hands , he says . They are vivid against the white sand of the barrier islands , like hopping Christmas lights . " It 's really spectacular to see these brightly colored birds-indigo buntings and blackburnian warblers , scarlet tanagers , yellow warblers-foraging , trying to build up their energy supply so they can continue migrating . " <p> The birds stay from a couple of hours to a couple of weeks . Moving to the island 's north side , they flutter uncertainly , as if making up their minds to leave . Then , airborne , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up along the Mississippi toward St. Croix River country , perhaps , or northeast to the Smokies , the Appalachians , or Canada . <p> " The period of migration , just from a survival standpoint , is very critical and very stressful , especially for the trans-Gulf migrants , " Simons explains . " They have very little latitude , at that point , to continue or keep looking for suitable habitat . If they do n't find it , they 're in big trouble . They do n't have the luxury to go on another couple of hundred miles . " <p> There are only guesses as to how quickly stopover habitat may be disappearing within or south of our national borders , but few doubt that it is . The river forests of Texas are an important flyway , for instance , and they are falling fast , Rappole says . <p> " And just like musical chairs , " the 1990 Gulf Island migration report notes , " there are n't enough places to go around .... Remove this habitat and we pull an irreplaceable chair out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game is survival .
