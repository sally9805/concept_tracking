<p> After relegating individual investors to a back seat for a decade or more , Wall Street 's major brokerages suddenly are falling all over themselves to win back their loyalty . <p> All fall , brokerages have been revamping broker-training programs and readjusting how brokers are paid . The goal : to increase brokers ' incentive to treat individual clients well - and decrease their incentive to abuse clients ' trust . <p> If there 's an air of sheepishness surrounding the brokerages ' movements , there should be . For many big firms with operations in several areas of the securities business , the line of business that most seemed an afterthought in the 1980s was retail brokerage - selling investments to and trading for individual investors , mostly small ones . <p> Instead , firms chased institutional work - brokerage services for pensions , trusts , mutual funds and other big investment operations . They chased takeovers , leveraged buyouts and other deals . They did program trading . They invented elegant instruments of speculation . <p> Disaffected individual investors , meanwhile , were happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mutual funds . Those industries spent the ' 80s continuously coming up with ways to make individuals happy : no- load funds ( no commissions ) , direct-mail marketing , 24-hour toll-free customer-service lines , cheaper commissions , desktop quote services and home- computer hookups . <p> But the dealmaking business has dried up . A bear market is on , and even institutional brokerage work is hurting . Suddenly , retail brokerage looks promising to Wall Street 's giants- . Among steps being taken : <p> - Last week , Shearson Lehman Bros. said it is overhauling the way it evaluates and pays its brokers . Brokers who not only meet revenue-production goals but who also keep their records clean for five years - meaning no scrapes with regulators or complaints from clients - will get annual bonuses of up to $ 80,000 . To encourage brokers to stay on the job and build long-term relationships , each year 's bonus will be deferred for five years . <p> - Shearson 's plan was announced a week after Merrill Lynch , the largest brokerage firm , said it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 21 weeks - and keep brokers-in-training mostly on salary instead of giving them sales commission , to reduce the pressure to sell or else . Merrill also announced a 10-year deferred bonus of up to $ 100,000 for staying clean . <p> - Smith Barney blanketed retail-brokerage offices Dec. 6 with a memo about cold calls - strongly suggesting that brokers clean up their act concerning aggressive telephone pitches to strangers . Cold callers were told to be polite and only give advice that is general and educational . No more " have I got a hot deal for you . " Cold-call victims - investors put into inappropriate investments - made up a big chunk of the vast increase in lawsuits and arbitration cases against brokers in the past decade . <p> - A push is on by all the major brokerages to charge customers a percentage of the amount of money under management instead of charging commissions on trades and sales . Most brokerages require accounts of $ 100,000 or more to get fee-based service . But both Merrill and Shearson are talking about bringing minimums down . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their analysts ' research and recommendations less ambiguous and more useful and honest . Kidder , Peabody &; Co. told analysts this fall that they ca n't just recommend a stock because it will do better than the overall market because the overall market might be going down . Find stocks that you think will go up , Kidder analysts were told . Other big brokerage houses have simplified rating systems , so investors can better understand them . Another trend : adding a risk rating along with a recommendation to buy or hold . <p> " I think that the marketplace begs , as it should , that all firms in the industry now provide the best value for clients , " says Joseph Plumeri , head of retail operations for Shearson . " I think clients are contantly asking , ' How are your best interests and mine the same ? What value do you provide for me ? ' " <p> The moves come not only because brokerages need to build their retail bases but because the individual investor is a much tougher sell now . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a relationship , " says Winford Smith Jr. , Merrill 's senior vice president for national sales . " The world is changing . " <p> Time was when investors were far more easily duped and brokers had a field day selling everything from penny stocks to ridiculously risky limited partnerships to customers who needed conservative investments . Such stories increasingly made their way into the public eye as brokerage arbitration statistics became more widely publicized and even naive investors became more suspicious . Add to that an investor population hell-bent on educating itself . About 700 people poured into the National Association of Investors Clubs meeting in November despite a bear market ripping through Wall Street . " It was a 25% increase over the previous year , " says NAIC President Thomas O'Hara . " They sure were looking for information . " <p> The availability of performance information from many sources , combined with individual investors ' growing ability to evaluate it , is what in part prompted Shearson to crack down on its fund managers . Eight of them have been fired in recent months . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underperformed the competition and rank very poorly in objective surveys . " No question that some of our funds have had performance in past years that has not been particularly strong , " says Jerome H. Miller , president of Shearson 's Asset Management Group . " We 've addressed that , and performance has picked up appreciably . " Plumeri adds that Shearson also has given pink slips to 150 brokers whose sales techniques were questionable . <p> Serving a more savvy customer also means having more savvy brokers . " There are brokers who lie , but there are also brokers who do n't know , " says Richard Ross of Elrick &; Lavidge , a market-research firm serving the financial-services industry . For Merrill , it means not only longer training for new brokers but retraining for old ones . <p> For Shearson , which has shut down its training program for new brokers , that means bringing the existing troops in for brush-up courses on everything from trusts and estates to asset allocation . <p> Both Smith and Plumeri say they 're banking on the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Most of the people who are knowledgeable do n't have the time to ( run a portfolio ) well , " Smith says . " An awful lot of lay people understand about medicine but ca n't be their own doctors . " Plumeri adds that Shearson 's job from here is to " convince the public that there 's value in using a human being " to pick investments . <p> Brokerages had better hurry up with their campaigns to win back individual investors , says money manager Kurt Brouwer of Brouwer &; Janachowski , because discount brokers and other competitors are winning market share fast . " There is nothing that a brokerage firm does for the retail customer that ca n't be done better elsewhere , " declares Brouwer , a former Merrill broker . " They 've lost their franchise . The fact is that the brokerage business as presently constituted has a shelf life of five years . I do n't think brokerage firms would survive if they were to stay as they are right now .
