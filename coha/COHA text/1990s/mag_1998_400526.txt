During their second year of life , children start to notice enough similarities between objects to group them together . For example , the two dogs next door are in the same category as your family pet because they all bark and have fur . Next , toddlers learn to label the categories with words , such as " dog . " As milestones go , sorting may not seem as profound as speaking in sentences , yet putting objects into categories is the basis for language , says Abbey Griffin , Ph.D. , senior associate at Zero to Three , a Washington , DC-based educational organization that focuses on children under 3 . Sorting also lays the groundwork for learning math : Only when a child can group dogs together can he understand how many there are at the neighbor 's house and how many of those are brown and how many are black .
