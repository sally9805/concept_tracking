It seemed a long shot  --  a greatest-hits album from a bluegrass band that had never had a hit  --  but Now That I 've Found You by Alison Krauss and Union Station was the from-nowhere find of 1995 . A beguiling sample of R. and B. , pop and blue-eyed gospel tethered to Krauss ' soaring soprano , the CD sold well , won some Grammys and established its lead singer as proof there was still purity and clarity in country music . <P> So Long So Wrong ought to be Krauss 's sellout album  --  the one where she signs with a big label , paddles in the pop mainstream , does a Streisand duet , maybe has a few cuts produced by Babyface . But Krauss is a constant lass : she 's been with Union Station and Rounder Records since she was a 14-year-old fiddle phenom ( she 's now 25 ) . The new set has no guest shots or power-pop charts . It 's just 48 minutes of beautiful music . <P> Four numbers spotlight other band members in hard-line bluegrass , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But there 's plenty for fans of Krauss 's vocal virtuosity . Mark Simos ' Find My Way Back to My Heart ( whose melody echoes Paul McCartney 's I 've Just Seen a Face ) is a lesson in hard-earned self-reliance ; Happiness ( lyric by Michael McDonald ) has the ethereal Eire sound of Enya . The anthemic finale , There Is a Reason , begins in a string-quartet drone and escalates to a wilderness cry for salvation . These are songs in the past tense  --  love mourned , pain savored , from beyond the grave . Or from heaven : Krauss has the voice of a lost angel , beckoning you into the beyond . <P>  --  By Richard Corliss
