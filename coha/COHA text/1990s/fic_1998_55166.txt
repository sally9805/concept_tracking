As SOON AS SHE FIGURED OUT that he was a spy , Marie Ormsby began to feel better about her decision to sleep with Alexi Ivanovich . Because it had taken a decision , relentlessly premeditated over two painful days . She also felt better about her winter getaway trip to Spain , and about herself in general . A woman who fell into an affair with a Russian spy in an absurdly picturesque mountain town like Candelario was a woman she herself would get in a car and drive a long way to meet . And there she was , handy in the morning mirror : firm at forty , lonesome lines around the eyes and the mouth , the chips of gray in her auburn hair still a surprise , a dare to herself to let it stay . The lies she told the Russian were not intended to misrepresent herself . She used them , rather , to agitate free the story he did not want to tell . <p> It came to her the way one presumed such things came , in an intuitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cobbled street in the rainy dark . Marie was absorbed in all the newness , which rubbed her pleasantly raw . The double wooden doors on the old stone houses were shut against the weather , as were all the windows , the blind eyes of small minds . The deep cleft gutters , also of stone , ran noisily . A troupe of Spanish tourists went past them , going downhill to the El Refugio bar , leaving a wave of tobacco smoke and the after-echo of conversation about the importance of being entertained . <p> Gaining a flat crest where their street intersected with another , Alexi tugged at her . Marie marked the moment . It was the first time he gave something of himself away . He pointed at the shadow of a man , thrown in heroic relief against a mustard-colored wall above them . The man swept steadily with a long-handled broom . From a certain stiffness of the chest , he was almost certainly wearing an apron . They watched the shadow sweep for a long time , the walls of two identical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view they might have had of the actual man . <p> " See that ? " Alexi told her finally . Excitement marbled the satisfaction in his voice . " What you see . . . That is more interesting than the man himself . Do you understand , Marie ? " <p> She saw , she understood . " You 're a spy , are n't you , " she said . <p> His laugh was subject to interpretation , but that 's what she was good at . Working with autistic children all those years had developed what she described to her friends as her antennae . She heard communications emitted on very high , very narrow frequencies . It was a talent , like swimming well . The real trick had to do with correct interpretation . <p> " I 'm a businessman , " he told her . " Not as successful a businessman as I would like to be , but . . . " Ee shrugged his square shoulders , and she was sure . <p> That night he fell asleep in her bed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had to be fifty , but he had been born with the kind of body that required little maintenance . The muscles were sculpted with an eye to symmetry , the belly perfectly flat . Gray veins ran in his thinning blond hair . The hair on his chest was a graying prairie tapering down to his navel . It was a body that would keep on serving him without making any demands , and he would never realize there was any other kind . With the flat of her nail she touched the red-and-blue oblong medallion tattooed on his left biceps , and he came awake , expecting trouble . <p> " Tell me something I 've never heard , " he requested politely , blinking in the shaded lamplight , which was thick as butter . Sometimes his English was sluggish , but he managed the language at least as well as she handled Spanish . <p> " I left my husband in Fort Myers because he was running around with another woman . " <p> He nodded , taking it in the way an imaginative person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It did n't matter that she had never been married . <p> " I 've never told anyone this , " she said . " The night I found out what Roy was doing to me , I drove my car to the beach . Alone . I took off my clothes and swam out in the surf far enough that I thought I would n't be able to make it back to shore . " If she had been married , and her husband had betrayed her in the way she envisioned it happening , she would indexed have driven to the Gulf and struck out for Mexico . Dog-paddling to oblivion . <p> " But you made it , " Alexi pointed out , and she knew that he had been lying about his own divorce . He was still married . <p> " How old are they ? Your children ? " <p> He had told her , the first time they talked , that the marriage had been childless , dismal , and short-lived . <p> " Seventeen and twenty , " he admitted . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their absence . . . " He could n't come up with the English words he wanted , so he finished the sentence with his hands , which then took her smallish , unremarkable breasts with his winning gentleness and made the nipples stand up . She felt the awkward lurch of wanting inside herself and decided to call it love . <p> She got out of bed to open the skylight so that the smell of woodsmoke came drifting in on the flat back of the rainy air . They made love again , the rain not like background music , exactly , but performing a similar important function . Every time brought her closer to closing the gap . Until she said yes and he came courtly and confident with flowers in his beefy hands into her room under the eaves in the inn , she had n't known that the gap existed . But there it was : on one side , her same old crouching self , locked in a habit of anxious waiting ; on the other side , what her body remembered about lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what her body whispered , colluding , to her mind . <p> Afterward she could not allow him to ease into sleep without asking the question . " I do n't really expect you to tell me things you ca n't share . But what I said before . About your being a spy . Are you in trouble ? Is there some kind of danger ? " <p> " I 'm in business , " he told her patiently , the way a father would remind his scatterbrained child of something he had cleared up the day before . " Our company imports farm equipment . Will you believe me when I show you my John Deere hat ? " <p> " Then what are you doing here ? In Spain , in Candelario ? " <p> " A small holiday , " he told her ' not for the first time . " The first time in this many years that I have gone on holiday alone . Do you accuse me of something ? " <p> " Only of not being straight with me . " <p> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was charmed by the challenge of learning by indirection . Not that it was a game , or at any rate not a frivolous one . She thought it likely , rather , that the perspective one gained looking with diligent eyes down a long , poorly lit alley became its own reward . Spy novels had never interested her . She thought she might try one , now . <p> For the next several days she peered down the alley . She had planned to move on to Cantabria by then , but she quietly rearranged her schedule . She held onto the room under the eaves , next to his . She was certain that Alexi Ivanovich had come to a crossroads in his life and career . Something had gone seriously wrong with his work . Although he would not talk head-on about it , it seemed to give him pleasure to vent obliquely , out of the side of his mouth , with reference to things that ostensibly had nothing to do with the world of espionage . <p> He disliked the Spaniards . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words to that demeaning effect . She knew that was her prompt , and she asked what he meant . <p> " They are consumers , " he groused sententiously . " A race of flower arrangers . Look at their eyes . There is no bottom . It is only top . " <p> " No depth , just surface ? " <p> He nodded vigorously . <p> " What should they be ? " she wanted to know . <p> He waved one hand dismissively . They were sitting in a noisy bar drinking hot chocolate and sharing a plateful of the greasy sticks of fried pastry called churros . The hubbub around them was Spanish and smoky and , in Marie 's opinion , healthily exuberant . But she drew him out , forced him to say the things he wanted to be forced to say . Western Europe was decadent . The end of the Cold War had allowed the prosperous nations of the West to sink into a vapid trough of consumerism . The only ideology that counted was the ideology of counting . The Right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and irrelevant . The heavy center was asleep . Nothing mattered the way things ought to matter . <p> " You want to bring back the Cold War , " she told him . " You miss the spice , the edge , the sense of importance . Importing farm equipment under communism was a more satisfying experience than it is now . " <p> He may not have caught all the words , but he caught her drift . She had n't known she was capable of this sort of verbal play . It excited her , made her feel accomplished and more interesting than the woman who packed her bag to go to Spain . Alexi Ivanovich was angry . He called for the check and stormed out into the night , which was cold and crisp . The rain had let up , and the woman at the desk in the inn , chain-smoking unfiltered Ducados as she read Jose Donoso , told Marie the next time it would be snow . Marie had read El Obsceno Pajaro de la Noche in a college class . She associated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she found herself unable to return the woman 's smile . <p> That night for the first time Marie went to Alexi 's room . When he would n't answer her knock , she opened the door . <p> " I am tired , " he lied . He polished his boots furiously . His hands were stained oxblood . <p> " No you 're not . " <p> " I 'm tired of you , " he lied again . " Go away . " <p> " You 're not tired of me . " <p> " I am leaving this wretched place tomorrow morning . " <p> It was his third consecutive lie . She went close enough to rub the knots out of his large , square shoulders . Doing so produced an enjoyable sexual tension that she was happy to prolong . <p> " My father was a union organizer , " she told him . Actually , he had been dean of student affairs at a small college affiliated with the Presbyterian Church , a registered Republican who considered the melting-pot theory a disguised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy for Marie as it was necessary . <p> She felt the tension evaporate from Alexi 's body as she described the campaign of intimidation and terror that company management had engaged in against her father in their small Alabama mill town . l heir house had been marked . A firebomb through the living-room window . Bags of cow manure flung at the front porch . She was in sixth grade . Her classmates first responded with the same scatological scorn their parents demonstrated , calling her names that came close to breaking her bones . Then they ostracized her , which was a relief that hurt , like dying and going to your own funeral . <p> The story  --  transmitted through her strong , massaging fingers at the same time that it came out in English words , in sentences that surprised her  --  unlocked one of his own . He had been in Bulgaria . <p> " Importing farm equipment ? " <p> Head down , he ignored the question . His wife had taken the children home to Russia for the New Year 's holiday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dacha on the Dnieper . Something had come up at work  --  Marie imagined what that might have been , in 1979 , before anyone could have guessed that in ten years the Berlin Wall would come down in a fit of popular pique  --  so he was stuck in Sofia . Lonesome and feeling sorry for himself , he had dinner at a restaurant where the food and the service and the vulgar atmosphere were worse than anything he had endured in Moscow . The waiter assigned to his table did not trouble to conceal his dislike of the Russian he was forced to attend to . His nose was as long and straight as a drill , and the lobe of his left ear was covered with ugly brown hair , a birth defect guaranteed to induce resentment in the bearer . At midnight , minutes into a new and historically significant decade , Alexi Ivanovich left the restaurant frustrated and restless . <p> For an hour he walked through the streets of a neighborhood he had never noticed . Snow fell with a suspect gentleness , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The new snow covered the mounds of graying old snow pitted with sooty black . He listened unwillingly to the frenetic sounds of music and parties and boisterous drunks channeling their aggression into socially acceptable forms . Then , coming to him on the sidewalk , a woman in a ratty fur coat , brazenly unbuttoned to show off a diaphanous pale-blue nightgown with a feathery collar , under which her bony chest jutted in a parody of provocativeness . She had to be forty-five or so , but she wanted to look thirty , and the attempt was humiliating . Her teeth were bad , snaggling when she smiled . <p> " They 've taken my cigarettes , " she told him in slurred and halting Russian . Tears started from her black eyes . She must have been crying off and on all night , the way her face had swollen . Violet eyeshadow had leaked down her thin face . He offered her a smoke . <p> Makbule was an ethnic Turk , a refugee from a city in the interior into which Bulgarian security police had swept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhabitants ' names were forcibly Bulgarified . A press on which local news and advertisements were printed in Turkish was smashed and left in pieces on the street . The most beautiful woman in the city , betrothed to the son of the mayor , was gang-raped in public . When the mayor 's son attempted to intervene , they shot him . Makbule had watched the incident from a second-story window . She focused on the face of the mayor 's son as he decided to make a gesture that he knew was futile and would cost him his life . It was clear he had no stomach for heroism . <p> She took Alexi Ivanovich to the room she was renting by the week in a fourth-rate hotel . The roses on the faded wallpaper might have been cabbages , the leaves wrinkled and blowsy . Somehow she had come up with a bottle of vermouth . There was nothing to mix with it . Sharing the bathroom glass back and forth , they emptied the bottle . She wanted to hate him for seeing her in her decay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imperial . The Turks and the Russians were historic enemies . But she hated the Bulgarians more fiercely , more completely , and she needed an emotional ally . She also needed money , and he needed an outlet that took without giving back . The sex they transacted taught him something he would have been happy not to learn . <p> From the things he said and did n't say , from the way he said and did n't say them , Marie understood that New Year 's in Sofia in 1979- ' 80 had catalyzed a loss of political faith in Alexi Ivanovich . She thought she knew how it must have been for him after that : He became a conscious cog in an unconscious Soviet machine . It took an effort of will to show up every day and commit espionage . The work alienated him from his new self , and he found himself going through estranging motions . Impossible to stop , or escape . Despite his distaste for it , he had to accomplish enough to fend off the suspicion of his superiors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than likely , would not understand ; she was the daughter of a retired colonel . He trusted no one , confided nothing . There was no way out . <p> The love they made when the story was over embarrassed her . Not before Alexi , but before herself . Not the voracity of her desire , and the way it transfigured her , taking her face away , but her ignorance : that she could have known herself so little , allowed herself to go so long without realizing how hungry she was . <p> Sleeping cradled in his arms , she had a dream that confused her . She was dog-paddling on the Gulf of Mexico . Three-quarters of a tan moon threw light on the water that : spread like tinkly oil . The beach was a long way behind her , and she was afraid her strength would not hold out . Then here came a raft of sorts , with a blue sail . Roy was on the raft . He was wearing a green-and-yellow John Deere cap . He seemed reluctant to pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she expected the name of the floozy who had seduced him to follow , but what he told her was that his English was imperfect . It does n't matter , she tried to say , but the words , like her body , were waterlogged , and she felt herself sinking . <p> In the morning Alexi Ivanovich told her he needed to go out for a while . He was n't running away . He left his room key and suitcases as collateral . She lay in his bed drinking coffee and eating tangerines , reading a celebrity gossip magazine in Spanish . Paging idly through the vapid features , she drew a mental comparison between Roy , whom she had invented , and Alexi Ivanovich , whom she had discovered . Roy worked as a lineman for Florida Power and Light . Friday and Saturday nights he played drums in a country-and-western band that gigged in middle-income bars . He 'd been married before , and every Christmas he became depressed , wondering whether his daughter was getting too old for the teddy bear he wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughtful , and without being asked he went outside to smoke his Camels . Whereas Alexi Ivanovich . . . She had little except what he deft casually behind : the smell of his sweat ; the taste of his skin ; the papery , electric fuel in her fingers after she ran them through the hair on his beautiful chest . She wondered whether the effects of working for a long time with autistic children could be objectively measured in a person . <p> When he came back , Alexi was more animated than she had seen him . He wanted to take her to lunch . Curious , she followed him to a small restaurant paneled in dark wood , where hunting-trophy heads hung on every wall and a flat-eyed waiter with a stiff mustache limped over to take their order with the air of a man doing a favor he would regret . Brisk , Alexi ordered venison stew for her without inquiring what her preference was . She realized just how much she valued the things she could not invent , or remember , or imagine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell you the story of a friend of mine , " he told her . She understood that the friend was Alexi Ivanovich himself , and also that their affair was hurtling toward its predestined end . She wondered whether it might have lasted longer , for any reason , if they had met during the Cold War , when there was an edge to his life . <p> " I had a dream last night , " she told him . " Roy was wearing your hat . " <p> He may have been growing accustomed to her non sequiturs , or else he was completely absorbed in putting his story into tellable form . He ignored her dream and his own hat on the head of her philandering husband . <p> Emotional intensity caused him to mangle the English more than usual , but as he constructed , she reconstructed , and the essential came through . His friend 's name was Peter . Peter 's father had served as a noncommissioned officer in the Russian Army at a famous battle in which they repulsed the Nazis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Communist Party , who took him under his feathered wing . The Party man prospered ; so did Peter 's father . One benefit was a choice of schooling options for his gifted and ambitious son , who wound up employed abroad as what Alexi described as a gatherer of information . ( She let the euphemism pass ; she wanted the story . ) <p> Peter believed in his work , believed in the effort to which his work contributed and in the rationale that undergirded the effort . The superstructure of his belief was securely anchored to the world as he saw it to be , and also to his heart . He learned to overlook , or forgive , or take in stride the peccadilloes and blind stupidities and the outright treachery of those around him , who believed less , or differently , or not at all . Then some-thing happened  --  a desperate Turkish woman begging for a cigarette in Sofia , Bulgaria , Marie did n't bother to say  --  and it was no longer possible to believe in the way he had believed before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the work for which he no longer had a heart . ( The KGB , thought Marie , and a wife who would n't understand , and children on whom ugly consequences could be wrought . ) And then the whole system came apart . The Wall came down . The enterprise imploded . <p> " That must have been a relief , " Marie told him . She was trying to like the tangy flavor of the venison stew , which assaulted her taste buds with violence . Her father had been opposed to hunting . They had never had deer meat in the house . Not until they give the deer their own guns to shoot back with , he had said whenever the subject came up . <p> " Why relief ? " <p> " Because your friend , Peter , had no more reason to pretend to believe . " <p> He looked at her with his intense , alien curiosity until she realized she had been naive again , or dense , or maybe just slow on the uptake . <p> " The system of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the society in which it existed . " <p> " So he had to go on pretending . " <p> " People depended on him . " <p> " Of course . I 'm sorry . " <p> " It is an ethical question , Marie . Such questions continue to exist . " <p> She nodded . This time she got it . " The private needs of the individual versus the collective needs of the people who depend on him . " <p> It was like giving him a gift . He beamed , called the flat-eyed waiter and told him to bring a second bottle of red wine . No , the house tinto was not good enough . He wanted something exceptional . <p> " I hate people who make a god of their own needs , their own desires , their own swollen selves . Capitalism 's superstructure of belief . . . " The good wine and the emotion kept him from going on . <p> It was Marie 's idea to rent the car . It came to her as they stepped outside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Dnieper , she thought . So there they were on a narrow , devious road going up a mountainside through pine trees that collected the snow in wet clumps . The snow pleased both of them . Marie was driving the boxy , avocado-colored Seat sedan . Alexi rolled down the window and stuck his hand out to catch a few flakes . Cattle bells clinked tinnily , the animals themselves invisible in the gray air , which was thick as wadded cotton . <p> The road ended at a table of earth called La Plataforma , where they left the car in a parking lot . The few people who had ventured to the top of the mountain in the storm were clustering in a bar . Marie and Alexi Ivanovich had the vast outside to themselves . They made snowballs and threw them at each other , built an anatomically correct snowman , kissed and clenched in a fever whose heat came from knowing it was almost over . <p> Alexi was the one who found the track up through the woods to the crown of the mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Marie felt as if she were going to church in a procession . It was a rite not of passage but of something passed . The angle was steep ; it was hard work climbing without slipping on the snow . Marie breathed hard , trying to keep up with the Russian spy , who was in terrific shape despite the cigarettes he savored so much . She envied him not the body but his unconsciousness of it , his oblivious ignorance of what he had . <p> Near the top he must have realized she needed a break . They stopped and felt the snow dropping down on them , on everything . For a few quiet moments , they watched the cloud cover tear and a frayed strip of blue sky become briefly visible . The sun appeared , a luminous wafer . Then the wind picked up suddenly again . First the wafer , then the patch of blue , disappeared . From the other side of the mountain the wind came boiling up and over furiously , hurling and tearing the snow clouds as it moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away for good . The wind boiled , the clouds shredded , the wet snow swirled . And Alexi Ivanovich held her fast and hard . <p> " I have never been to a place like this before , " she confessed . She wanted to tell him something that was indisputably true . <p> " I can not . . . " he told her , and she thought he might cry . <p> " Yes you can , " she told him . <p> " It 's an ethical question . " <p> " If you do n't do what you have to do , you will die . " She wanted to tell him something she knew to be true . Like me , she did n't say , because she was n't sure whether she meant it . <p> " Marie ? " <p> She wanted him to tell her something that he knew to be true . She wanted the sun to continue appearing and disappearing in a wrath of storm clouds until she got tired of seeing it . She wanted the Cold War to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fight . She wanted to put her tongue into his mouth and lick at the leftover cigarette taste there . She wanted a life with something in it worth betraying . <p> It would have been nice to have someone in whom to confide what Marie Ormsby knew she would never tell : that she had secretly and successfully tracked a Russian spy across a mountain town in the middle of Spain to a rendezvous with his assigned contact from American intelligence . She knew the man was an American by his casual clothes , which were what you would expect to find in a New Hampshire ski resort on a person who spread his money across a conservative range of mutual funds . He could not have been more than thirty-five . He was blond , and his body language was finicky , and he was comfortable in the world he owned . She disliked him on sight . <p> He met the Russian in a small bar not designed to entice tourists . La Cueva de San Blas stood slope-shouldered at the end of a cul-de-sac in tire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the morning , Alexi Ivanovich and the American were its only customers . From an angle in the street outside , Marie was able to observe them through the window . They sat side by side at the bar talking like new friends . <p> The discussion lasted fifty-seven minutes . When the American called for the check , Alexi put his hand on the man 's arm and paid the bill himself . Marie opened a wooden gate and stepped behind a house until they came outside . She was able to see the designedly casual handshake as they parted , and to hear on the cobbles the heels of their boots going away in separate directions . <p> Alexi Ivanovich was gone by the time she returned to the inn . She was not surprised . For form 's sake she asked the chain-smoking woman at the desk whether the Russian who had just checked out had given a forwarding address , or mentioned where he was going . Or left her an envelope , a message . None of the above . The woman lacked only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind was in that complicated elsewhere . <p> Marie was not sure what it was she was about to grieve , or how to go about it . All she knew was where . The great thing about Fort Myers was its proximity to the beaches , to the Gulf of Mexico . She made a couple of telephone calls , canceling the rest of her trip and moving up her return reservation . She was lucky . The travel agent in Madrid found her a seat on a Continental flight leaving the next morning . <p> Running into Alexi 's American contact was not what she expected when she took a last walk through Candelario . He must have given himself a half-holiday , mission accomplished by noon and nothing else to do so close to nowhere . She saw him on the street outside El Refugio , from inside which the sounds of revelry came with a stupefying insistence that made Marie think of Alexi in Sofia on New Year 's Eve in 1979 , just before he met the Turkish woman who precipitated his crisis of faith . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she told the American intelligence man . Her voice was firm and rational , or could be heard as such . " I promise . Will you tell me what he decided to do , finally ? I 'm talking about Alexi Ivanovich . " <p> He looked at her with a superciliousness she assumed was part of their training , one of the hundred ways people like him learned to keep their distance . " I 'm sorry ? " <p> " The Russian . The spy . The man you had coffee with at La Cueva de San Blas . Did he accept your offer , or did he go back home to Russia ? I promise , I swear , I wo n't say a word to anyone . Who could I tell , anyway ? There 's nobody who wants to know . For God 's sake , please just tell me what Alexi Ivanovich decided to do . " <p> " I think you must be mistaking me for someone else . " <p> He was trying to grow a mustache . The pale hairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands . He moved away , changing his mind about having an early drink in El Refugio , where the Spaniards were entertaining themselves with abandon . <p> She grabbed his arm , held it hard enough that he stopped walking . <p> " Are you out of your mind , lady ? " he hissed through white lips . He was young enough not to have run into this situation before , and he was n't sure how to extricate himself . <p> " I 'm begging , " she told him . Funny how she was able to say something so true and simple to a man she despised . " I have to know . " <p> " I wish I could help you , " he said , shaking her off a second time , " but I ca n't . You must think I 'm someone I 'm not . " He had taken a six-month course somewhere in the vicinity of Washington , D.C. , to learn how to say it the way he did , with a frigid indifference that was as cruel as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Give me a piece of paper and a pencil , " she said . " If he did decide to go to the United States , I want him to know how to get in touch with me . You can do that much , ca n't you ? You can give him my address . That 's all I ask . If he does n't get in touch , I 'll know he went home to his family . That 's fair , is n't it ? That does n't create any problems for you . I mean there 's no breach of national security . " <p> But if he had paper and pencil , he was n't giving them to her . A third time he pulled free of her desperate clutch and walked quickly downhill to the central plaza , where he had left his car . <p> The last thing she had expected to do in Candelario was kneel on a street of stone and weep while tourists burbled around her , making each other happy , happy . Sollozar , she thought . How in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sobbing ? She sobbed . She understood , finally , Alexi Ivanovich 's dislike of the Spaniards . The cobbles were wet . The knees of her jeans soaked through , and a rod of pain shot through her left leg toward her groin . This was how it would have been with Roy , except Roy was a bastard . That was the good of living so close to the Gulf . Before she got to her feet , she knew she was going to identify the exact lack , the specific absence , that she had to grieve . It had a name in Russian . She pronounced the name . She stood up and went in the direction of the Gulf of Mexico . It shamed her that the movement her abandoned body made was like dog-paddling . But the shame created heat , and the heat kept her alive , and she was grateful . <p> <p> By MARK JACOBS <p>
