Math teacher Zbigniew Zielina was puzzled by the silence . It was early in the school year , he was about to begin his algebra class , and the Santa Paula High School instructor detected none of the loud talk and scraping chairs that usually marked his students ' entrance . He turned to investigate . " I see 30 kids quietly copying the questions , " he recalls . " They were ready to work . In all my years , I have never seen this . " <P> Until last September , no one in Santa Paula , Calif. , had . That 's when the tiny ( pop : 27,000 ) farm community , about 65 miles northwest of Los Angeles , decided to integrate its college-prep and " general " education students so that slow , average and accelerated learners would sit side by side . It is a bold experiment . Segregating students by ability  --  a vintage classroom organizational tool known as " tracking " or " ability grouping "  --  is practiced in at least 80% of U.S. high schools , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Santa Paula , anger at the grouping system had smoldered for decades . " This is a small town that 's been run the same way forever , " says special-programs teacher Lisa Salas , who went through school on the " standard " track and says she struggled unprepared through college . Her father Robert , a retired investigator for the local district attorney 's office , was so angry about his own low-ball education that he ran for and won a seat on the school board . During the campaign , he found that most townspeople agreed that Santa Paula 's schools provided a quality education for its few high achievers but substandard schooling for the majority of students . <P> In 1996 the district hired superintendent William Brand , who had helped eliminate tracking in Escondido , Calif . Brand immediately set out to do the same at Santa Paula High School . But he faced resistance . Virtually the entire English department opposed the change , claiming that mixing high-achievers with average students would force the curriculum to be " dumbed down . " Calls from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They thought the world was ending , " he recalls . <P> After months of debate and a raucous school-board meeting , supporters of detracking , like science teacher Ray Sepulveda , won out . On his own , Sepulveda had detracked his classes a decade earlier , eliminating prerequisites so that any student who wanted to take college-prep or honors courses could do so simply by signing up . " I think everybody should be exposed to the good stuff , " he says . To ease the transition to the new , detracked environment , principal Antonio Gaitan organized after-school tutoring and Saturday enrichment classes for 700 former standard-track kids . " It 's vital to build in curriculum support , " Gaitan explains . " You do n't just throw kids into the deep water . " Have they learned to swim ? The early results , at least , are promising . Doomsayers predicted that at least half the student body would flunk out in the new system , but by the end of last year 80% had a GPA of 2.0 or better ; 47.5% had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SAT score rose from 869 to 953 . " It 's been good for some people , " says junior Chris Garmon . " You get challenged . "
