<p> Ron Marquardt routinely works 60 or more hours a week as a manager at Whitaker Buick Jeep Eagle in St. Paul , Minn . If you want to reach him by phone , it 's best to try him at the office . <p> " Do n't bother calling me at home because I 'm only there on Sundays and Thursday afternoons , " he says . <p> Chris Brown Mahoney works full time as an industrial-relations instructor . But she spends an additional 15 to 30 hours each week working at her own consulting firm . <p> " Some weeks all I do is work , whether it is Monday or Saturday , " she says . " Since I do almost all of my work at home , I never really leave work . " <p> Like most employed Americans , whether professionals or hourly wage earners , Marquardt and Mahoney are working harder than ever , running faster to keep pace with their life 's demands . <p> Unlike a factory worker who faces mandatory overtime , Marquardt and Mahoney are working hard by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marquardt could hire a part-timer and shave 20 hours off his schedule . But he would n't gross upward of $ 95,000 a year . <p> Nor would he have his finger on the pulse of the place - which salespeople are working hardest , which customers keep coming back . <p> The national trend of overwork - or a vigorous work ethic - depending on how you view it , is most noticeable in the white-collar class . <p> Managers , professionals and salespeople - men , in particular - put in more hours per week than blue-collar and hourly workers , U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics says . <p> Only truck drivers and transportation workers equal weekly hours clocked by most professionals . <p> Forty-five percent of male managers and 25 percent of female managers averaged at least 49 hours of work per week in 1993 , according to labor bureau figures . <p> That compares with 9 percent of female laborers and 16 percent of male laborers who worked about 50 hours a week . <p> Bricklayers , food canners and other hourly employees stand to earn more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's not necessarily true for professionals . <p> It 's hard to elicit sympathy for a 70-hour-a-week executive who rakes in $ 150,000 per year . But the extra hours do n't put more money in her pocket . <p> Professionals are ratcheting up their work hours for psychological reasons more than financial ones . <p> Despite the strong economy , and their own robust salaries , many white-collar workers are driven by fear - fear of remaining competitive , of appearing unambitious , of being replaced by a younger , stronger model . <p> " Given the greater competition in the economy , professionals are putting in extra hours because they want to show their boss they 're committed to their jobs , " says Barry Bluestone , a research associate with the Jerome Levy Economics Institute in New York and co-author of studies on employment trends . <p> " The bosses are working longer . They realize it 's a dog-eat-dog competitive world , and the race goes to the swift , " he says . <p> Take Amy Anderson , for example . The mother of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a group manager at Imation Corp . Her workday begins at 6 a.m. and often continues , after supper and bedtime stories , until past midnight . <p> As a new manager who oversees 60 people , Anderson never thinks she works enough . The learning curve gets steeper the higher she climbs . Anderson concedes she is a perfectionist . " When I accepted this position , I told my boss my fear of failure would drive me to success . For me it 's almost more stressful if I 'm not challenged , not leading . " <p> Ambition and a Type A personality always have been important for professionals . If you want to earn the income and reap the perks , you 've got to pay the piper . <p> Professionals and managers earned about 45 percent more than the median weekly pay of $ 459 for all occupations in 1993 , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics . <p> But why do so many white-collar employees demand more of themselves these days , when the tight job market would seem to give them more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer lies in insecurity . He cites a recent announcement by Chase Manhattan that it will lay off 4,500 workers . A fast-moving economy , by definition , is going to leave some people behind . <p> Indeed , American companies cut 3,438 jobs per day in February , up 8 percent from the same period a year ago , according to Challenger , Gray &; Christmas , a Chicago-based outplacement firm . <p> After years of downsizing , surviving employees are working longer hours . The same amount of work is being spread among fewer people . A heavy load falls on " exempt " professionals who do n't earn overtime pay . Pam Grayson , an administrative assistant for the Boy Scouts of America , learned that three years ago when her organization " right-sized , " as managers called it . <p> The restructuring did n't change Grayson 's job title , but she received a raise in exchange for additional duties . She also became a salaried worker , exempt from overtime . <p> Her expanded job description meant Grayson was handed responsibility for human-resources issues , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copies and fetching coffee . <p> Grayson swears she 's not resentful because she 's learning new skills . " I look at the responsibilities as opportunities , a way to grow , " she says . " And it is exciting . " <p> Still , she examines addictive patterns in her family and questions whether she has become a workaholic , a person who does n't know when or how to quit . Grayson is single and has no children . Her extra duties provide ample reason to stay at work . A friend gave her a kitten for Christmas , so she 'd be forced to go home . " And it 's worked , " she says . <p> A higher income allows Grayson , at 37 , to save for retirement . But the long hours have cost her several friendships and volunteer work she enjoyed . She looks with longing at a friend who recently switched to a part-time schedule . <p> Even professionals who love to work pay a price for their labors . <p> Imation 's Anderson says her family life is easier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children . No longer are the kids spending 50 hours a week in child care . But like many employed mothers , she puts her career and family ahead of her own health . <p> Mahoney , the college instructor who is running her own business , says she could juggle two jobs more easily if her personal life were calm . Her teen-age daughter recently moved back home . Her mother is recuperating from hip surgery . Her partner 's company has restructured . <p> Life is tougher because it moves faster . Mahoney fantasizes about taking a vacation with no computer , fax or e-mail . <p> At least Mahoney and Anderson are well-compensated for their stress . Not so for teachers , ministers and some other nonprofit workers . Like other professionals , they face expanding demands . They deal with increasingly complicated issues . <p> But there 's no fat paycheck to pad the sharp edges . You 'd think they 'd be the least-satisfied professionals . <p> In fact , people for whom work is a passion , a calling , may be the luckiest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built up a lifestyle that a layoff would shatter . They 're secure in knowing their work makes a difference . <p> Beth Symanski left a job at Yamaha Corp . three years ago to become a fifth-grade teacher in St. Paul , Minn . She earns less and works harder than she did in a corporation . The physical demands of teaching surprised her . But she loves her time with kids . " ' Overworked ' is not a word I 'd call myself , " she says . <p> " There 's no financial benefit to working extra hours here , " Symanski says . " But there 's so much extra good that does come out of it . I see it as a vocation . It 's not a job . "
