In Building 11 , the dingy former headquarters of Eastern Airlines at Miami International Airport , an alphabet soup of federal and state agencies went to work coping with the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew . EOC on Floor 2 , FEMA on 3 , JTF on 4 . CAP , COE , DNR , DER , SBA , GSA , even the ubiquitous IRS . In the hallways , Army Rangers in combat camouflage crossed paths with Army engineers in red shirts , sleepy-eyed state emergency officials in rumpled clothes and even Marilyn Quayle in Bermuda shorts and a ponytail . <P> Twenty-five miles south , in what was Homestead , the Army began checking in the first of the 17,000 homeless persons who are expected to occupy five tent cities , possibly until Christmas and beyond . " No drinking , no drugs and no profanity , " new arrivals were told . With area residents reluctant to leave their gutted homes , only a few hundred had taken up the Army 's offer of shelter by week 's end . <P> Torrential rains and mosquitoes made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last possessions . By Red Cross estimates , about 85,000 homes were destroyed or severely damaged by Andrew 's winds , which topped 164 m.p.h . Many may have to be razed . Insurers , who put private payout losses at $7.3 billion , were struggling to make contact with policyholders and vice versa . Angry homeowners have already filed lawsuits for shoddy construction against firms like Lennar Homes , southern Florida 's largest builder , and Arvida/JMB Partners . <P> For the second time since Andrew tore off into the Gulf of Mexico , George Bush and his entourage descended into the heat and bustle of South Florida , anxious to show their concern and capacity to make things right again . Bush promised to rebuild the gutted Homestead Air Force Base , which pumped about $400 million into the local farm-based economy , though logic suggested it should be closed . Bush also agreed to waive the normal 75-25 federal-local split on disaster costs ; Washington will pick up the full tab . <P> The President 's largesse , in fact , went well beyond Florida . In Fort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many as 150 F-16 fighters to Taiwan despite a longstanding policy against such sales  --  and despite a predictable explosion from Beijing , a regime Bush has taken considerable pains to cultivate . In Humbolt , South Dakota , and Shallowater , Texas , the President announced the release of $755 million in crop disaster relief , as well as $1 billion in export subsidies for U.S. wheat farmers . <P> When Bill Clinton learned of the handouts , he quipped to AFL-CIO members in Washington , " Now , I 'm a Baptist , so I believe in deathbed conversions . But this is amazing . " Clinton was not alone in noticing the contradictions . China denounced the F-16 sale to Taiwan and threatened to pull out of international arms-control accords . Europeans , whom the Bush Administration has been browbeating for being far too generous with their agricultural price supports , called the wheat deal belligerent .
