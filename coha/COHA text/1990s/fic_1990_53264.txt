They were living in Providence again after spending the summer in Wildwood , New Jersey . In Wildwood , Stephen worked on a fishing boat , a deep-sea charter named The Pied Piper . It was a bad name for a fishing boat since it made people think of rots in the water . Families and businesses hired the boat for reunions and other celebrations when members wanted to reaffirm their brotherhood . Occasionally , someone brought his wife along and it was a sore spot with the others . After a couple of weeks on the boat , Stephen 's bum turned deep bronze and he oiled his arms and chest every morning to enhance muscle definition . It seemed vain to Claire , like when a woman applies gloss to her mouth even though her lips are perfectly deep . While Stephen was on the boat , Claire worked at the Acme supermarket , which was giving double pay for inventory , then she stayed on to stock the shelves there . They both had their problems at those jobs . Claire was never careful with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boxes of cereal and crackers . Laundry soap sifted over the floor . Then she mined crates of coffee and cigarettes and was caught when she tried to throw the damaged cartons in the dumpster in back of the store . Stephen was more expert with the deep-sea fishing ; he knew when to head in because of rough weather and he docked just in time so the people were sick on shore instead of on the boat . He did n't get along with the people who hired the charter . He was called a first mate , but they treated him like a slave . He had to fetch them cold beers , bait their lines , scale the catch , and the tips were sometimes insulting . At the end of the summer , just as the school kids started buying notebook paper at the Acme , they resigned from their jobs . They prowled the boardwalk at Atlantic City for a week or so before going back north . <p> Whenever Stephen was out of work he seemed to suffer an unpleasant mix of feelings . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had resigned , writing a short note to the boss , explaining that the work just was n't his cup of tea . Between jobs , he took his freedom seriously and wasted no time with it . He approached Claire four or five times a day , and when he was n't in that privacy with her he was leading her somewhere else , strolling down the tide line or through the alleys behind the hotels . He searched until he found a place where it would happen again . Atlantic City was a perfect town for him . Despite the crowds , there was solitude . Everyone minded his own business . No one talked to people except for the occasional hick who had to explain his lucky streak to passers-by . In the secluded places along the shore and behind the gambling palaces where everything was dark and empty , he overwhelmed Claire with his single-mindedness . He took her into his private thoughts and she flexed and shuddered within them . There were losers everywhere , and this gave Stephen a combined sense of doom and gratitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between jobs . He still had a wad of cash . After a week of roaming.around , he got nervous again . He became cranky thinking about jobs . " I 'd rather be digging a ditch than nothing , " he said . <p> Then they were back in New England . They found an apartment on the fringes of College Hill where the rents edged down near the Chinese section . They were happy not to have to see all the university students nosing around . They found immediate employment , but the jobs were n't going to be permanent ones . They both worked days and they had the nights together . She was working at a bank in credit card operations . Her job was in the Customer Service Department and she was on the phone all day . There was a computer terminal on her desk , several journals with tiny print and folders of microfiche . The telephone was heavy in her hand , like a clot of hot tar resting against her cheek . The tendon of her thumb became sore after pressing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if she were playing Thumbilina . People called in to complain about their Mastercard accounts . Perhaps someone took a trip to Mexico and the hotel submitted erroneous charges for numerous papaya drinks . The cardholder would scream at her , saying that he was n't paying for drinks he never had . Claire listened and wondered what papayas tasted like . Women called in to ask about charges on their statements which they could n't identify . It might be Fantasy Phone and Date Lite , dial-a-porn charges which the women 's husbands or sons had contacted . She advised these customers , telling them that they should have a family powwow to bring it all out in the open . She told everyone to use cash instead of plastic . There was the matter of the finance charges , 21% accrued daily from the day the charges were posted to the account , before the customer even received a statement , but mostly it was a matter of human dignity , she explained . <p> She enjoyed finding the microfiche which had her ex-husband 's statement . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see just where he was putting his money . She could tell by her ex-husband 's purchases that he was certainly not someone to have second thoughts about , and the little bit of information was affirming to her . She reported to Stephen that her ex had charged items at The Gentleman Farmer , a fancy garden-supply store for suburban types . They laughed about it . Sometimes her ex-husband 's new wife would make charges at clothing stores called Ample Beauty , and Added Dimensions . This was of interest to Claire . " His wife still ca n't lose those pounds , " she said to Stephen . <p> Even with these few laughs the job in the credit card department was bad and she was always looking for something better . Stephen was at Sears at the Key Center . He made keys for housewives who had had recent close calls locking themselves out of the house or locking their babies in the car . They came in to get backups , and they watched him carefully to make sure he was n't making one for himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keys made . They asked him why he was still in town , did he ever graduate from the university , what was he doing at Sears ? When he was n't making keys , he was in Kitchen Appliances , sometimes they even made him sweep something up . Stephen was n't too happy about his position and together they looked at the Sunday paper . <p> They were thinking about finding work together . There were always ads for couples in the paper . Couples were sought to run group homes and halfway houses for the retarded , for substance abusers , or for the elderly . Claire did n't like the idea since it usually required residence in a place and the shifts were three days on , then three days off . She believed that kind of a cycle was disorienting . " You have to sleep there with those kids , " she told Stephen . <p> " It 's worse to eat with them . They slobber , " he told her . <p> " God , " she said . " That 's probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> He looked at her and smiled at her joke . <p> Before anything better came up , Claire had to quit her job at the bank . She could n't sit at the desk after she had some surgery . She could n't sit because of some stitches . Worse than the stitches were the spasms . The doctor told her it would take a long while for a torn bowel to heal . As it healed , the stitches would trigger spasms . He told Claire that the body can have a spastic response to trauma . " It 's trying to tell you something , it 's speaking out , " the doctor said . The doctor wanted to talk to Stephen about her condition , but his shift was over when Stephen came to visit her in the hospital . She did n't blame Stephen , he did n't force her into anything . He never had to convince her . Even with her back to him , his breath lifting the curl at the back of her neck , she sensed his concern for her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as his own . <p> She stayed home for several weeks enjoying the apartment , letting her hair air-dry , playing solitaire while the TV hummed over her shoulder . Now and then , she experienced an overwhelming , narrow edge of pain slashing the same few central inches . She fell , twisted on the carpet and tried to breathe , then it would pass . It happened less and less and she began to feel better . <p> Being at home so much made her see the flaws , the grime and stains of the place . She started to think she should fix up the apartment the way other women might try to do . The wallpaper in the kitchen depressed her . The pattern had dark vines upon which small tobacco-colored leaves seemed to wither . It was an ordinary ivy design over uniform bricks and it might have been meant to reflect autumn , but it suggested a wasted landscape . The wallpaper reminded her of an O. Henry story she read in high school in which a sick girl stares out her window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the ivy disintegrates and the leaves drift past her window , her days dwindle down . <p> " How many days do we have left ? " she asked Stephen , and they counted the ivy leaves on the wallpaper . While she was n't working she thought she might as well do something about it . She borrowed a heavy book of wallpaper samples from a hardware store , but she did n't find a pattern she liked . There were outlandish daisies , harsh plaids , cannons and militia , historic emblems and baseball team insignia . Painting over it might be the thing , but she was n't sure if this was an acceptable practice . When she asked Stephen , he told her she was crazy to think he was going to pay for fixing up the apartment . " You 're talking about external improvements , " he told her . " It wo n't solve anything . " <p> " It 's interior decorating , that 's what they call it , " she said . <p> " We ca n't afford any face-lifts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back and talk to me when you can tell me we own something ! " <p> It was bad staying in the apartment all day . She got up with Stephen and poured cereal in a bowl or boiled an egg . Then he was gone and she had the whole day . She looked out the window , pressing her forehead against the cold glass . On the street , a neighbor was scraping frost from a car windshield . A cold daylight was ascending , a neutral illumination or off-whiteness Claire associated with views from inside institutions . Her neighbor had finished clearing off his car and she watched him get behind the wheel ; she followed the small hesitations the car made as he drove it away . Sometimes , her friend Jeannie would come by . Jeannie worked for a realtor and often dropped in if she was in the neighborhood . Claire made her tea and they talked about finding a decent job . They listed the pros and cons of working behind a desk or having to stand up all day like they did when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I ca n't wear more than a two-inch heel or my back starts to hurt , " Jeannie said . <p> " That 's fight , " Claire said , " that college mined us for life standing over those sinks . " <p> " I only do Bobby 's hair anymore , " Jeannie said . " Even that brings back too many memories I ca n't cope with . " <p> They laughed at the idea , then looked out the window at the snow beginning to come down . <p> " Shit , " Jeannie told Claire . " I have two signs to put up and it 's murder when the ground is frozen . I just put up a Sales Pending down the street . That 's not hard , it just attaches to the For Sale sign . It 's the Sale signs themselves , they have to be pounded into the ground good and firm or kids pull them out . In this cold I ca n't get them to stand up . " <p> Claire asked her if she wanted any help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all day . Her friend did n't want her along and they said their goodbyes . <p> Soon , she took a part-time job . In this one , Claire took a carload of pets kittens , small dogs , and several rabbits to some nursing homes where the people could hold the animals for a while . She went with a social worker who explained to her the purpose of the job . She said , " Loneliness can kill an old person quicker than high blood pressure or pneumonia . Loneliness can kill you in the prime of life . It can even kill little babies ! It 's a syndrome where they just waste away . " <p> " There should be a vaccine . " Claire was joking , but her companion did n't find it something to be light about . <p> The social worker said that the pets ' names were different all the time : Fluffy , Whiskers , Snowball , Inky and such . The residents named them over and over again , but Claire should try to remember the correct names if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names ; it was one of the original pets . When Claire delivered the animals to the people at the retirement center , she had to recall which old lady liked which cat or bunny . One favorite pet was losing its fur , probably only a skin disorder , but the residents blamed one another for petting the rabbit too hard . Another of the old persons told Claire not to bring her the rabbit with " the sad ears . " <p> " Which one is that ? " Claire asked . <p> " That one there , the ears that wo n't stand up . " <p> Claire was thinking all the time , So this will be it . At home , talking to Stephen , she nicknamed the old age job , THE FINAL FRONTIER . " I 'm going to that Final Frontier , " she said to Stephen every time she left for work . Yet , there were one or two individuals at the nursing homes who made her enjoy the job . A woman named Mice amused Claire with her stories . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always with a tolerant shudder and a smile . It 's remarkable , Claire thought , how some old folks can seem to be entirely undaunted by the truth of their situations . Some were racy when telling jokes , a few were obscene and disgusted her . It made her think about the standard patterns of aging . In youth , a teenager is expected to swear at the slightest provocation ; a person in middle age is excused for his intense sarcasm or cynicism , certainly it came from too much education and a loss of religion , but old people are disliked , sometimes sequestered , if they use a vulgar word or if they admit that they are angry with how things turned out for them . Her own father was in Florida . The last time she saw him , he was dressed like an ice cream vendor . White stretch-belt slacks , creamy socks and white imitation gatorskin loafers . She did n't recognize him . She wondered if he would end up in a place like the homes she visited . She could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although he was always good with cats , it was because he ignored them and they could n't stand his indifference . They perched on him like parrots . He would n't want to be forced into this kind of activity , holding a cat for therapy or because a doctor prescribed it . <p> The woman Alice complained that there were n't any real cottontails amongst the pets . <p> " Cottontails are too wild for a petting zoo , " the social worker said . <p> " Peter , wild ? " Mice said . " Peter Cottontail is a pansy ! Ask my daughter , she married him . " Mice cupped one side of her mouth with a translucent hand . " My daughter says Peter ca n't perform . Well , I told her Brer Rabbit was the better one , but did she listen ? God 's gift to women , I told her . He had one longer than his ears ! " <p> " Really , Mice , you should n't encourage the others , " the social worker was saying . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ searching through the fur of their pets . " I ca n't find it , " one woman said . <p> " You never could find it , " another scolded her , and everyone laughed . Claire told Stephen the details of her day and he smiled , but he told her she should n't do that job much longer . " It does n't pay shit , " he said , emphasizing the last consonant to warn her he meant what he said . " It 's a job for volunteers , " he said . She would miss Alice , but she quit the job after receiving only two of the small paychecks . " It 's not worth the glimpse into the future , " she told Stephen . <p> Stephen kept on at Sears , and at first he did n't seem to mind being the only one holding a job . Maybe it was just her imagination , but she started to think he resented her time at the apartment . He came home from work and brushed by her , saying , " Kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " What 's wrong with it ? " She did n't see a crumb or a milky tumbler left out . <p> " It 's a dump , " he said . " I guess you 're used to it . " <p> " What does that mean ? " <p> He ran his finger down the full-length mirror in the bedroom . " You 're smoking too much . It 's all over everything in the house . Nobody should have to live like this . " He picked up her hairbrush and fooled with his short , blond hair . Sometimes Claire looked at Stephen and believed he mirrored the appearance of a white supremacist . This was when she was upset , suspicious , and his cornflower eyes , his fine profile , looked chilling . He had a perfect crease in his trousers which he kept fresh using his thumb and forefinger . This mannerism disturbed her more than any other . <p> He fell back on the bed . He arranged both pillows behind his head and he looked at his fingernails . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since he had placed both pillows behind his head and perhaps this was significant . She sat on the edge of the mattress and looked at him . He was flat on his back looking up at the ceiling . She was trying to gauge how she would creep in beside him . <p> " Why do n't you clean the bugs out of that lamp ? " he said . " It 's disgusting . " <p> She looked up at the dark plate of insects on the ceiling fixture . She was embarrassed by the sight of it , but it was just another thing for him to mention . She told him that it was there when they moved in . She looked up and saw the small bodies and exaggerated wings . " It makes a softer light , " she said . She was n't acting lazy , she just did n't want to touch the dust of those insects and wash the fixture . If it was washed it would attract still more of the same . It was a cycle which mirrored something more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the job opportunities out loud . There were several openings in the local jewelry factories . " That 's all assembly line stuff , " he warned her . " You might have to insert itsy bitsy earrings onto little squares of cardboard all day long or maybe they 'll make you sort links of chain . Millions of links . Also , there 's some chemical hazards . " <p> " Okay , okay , " she said . <p> " You 're not desperate . Not yet , " he said . <p> She did n't like it when he said " You 're not desperate . " Should n't he have said " We 're not desperate " ? <p> They still wanted to go into something together , but they did n't have the capital to take on a shoe store franchise , or even to lease and pay the insurance for a frozen lemonade truck . Claire thought it would be great to drive around the beaches and serve frozen lemonade all day . She liked the way the vendors were always friendly and tan with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the nose . <p> " It 's the middle of winter ! " he said . " Wake up to reality . " He did n't often use such cliched speech , he was telling her she was reaching a low level in his eyes , she was bottoming out . She deserved these phrases . <p> She went for an interview at a fish processing plant down in Newport . The salary was above average , she could work whatever shifts she wanted , and the plant was fight on Narragansett Bay where the view and the reflection off the water might be invigorating after being in the apartment . A woman gave her a tour of the plant which edged the water . Fish kept moving up and down belts . The job did n't appear difficult . She would arrange fish fillets in plastic trays and prepare them for freezing . Claire was ready to accept the position , but then the interviewer told her that Claire would , of course , have all her initial medical costs reimbursed . <p> " What do you mean ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the woman told her . " Most people do n't have too much trouble after the first few weeks . We 'll pay for any prescriptions you might get . " <p> " What kind of trouble are we talking about ? " " It 's normal until you become desensitized . " rash from the brine . After you get used to the brine , it 's clear sailing . " <p> Claire did n't want to arrange fish in plastic trays if it meant her skin was going to erupt . When she told Stephen about this , he looked at her as if she had made up the story about the brine . <p> " It 's true ! " she said . " I really want to work , you know , but not if it makes me sick ! " <p> " Maybe you have an allergic reaction to anything nine to five . " He was teasing her , but he walked away as he spoke and he did n't look back to reassure her . Later , he came back and they lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he rested the heels of his hands on her spine , then he gripped her hips . She felt the first , then the full progression of his thoughts . His silence , his wordless touch , increased its meaning and rhythm . He weighted her upon her own pain and placed her worth in it . She permitted it to happen and believed in its judgment . <p> The Marriott sparkled with brass doors and railings , but it was a sleazy motel with a slimy fountain in the bar . Two cherubs squirted a few gallons of stale water with some bleach added to it . It was n't a great place , but she was making tips along with the free stuff she crammed in her bag . She was cleaning rooms mornings with two other women . There were more women cleaning in the afternoons and still others at night . At least once a day she had to wash up some vomit , and there was some pretty disgusting litter in the rooms . Personal items left torn and crusted . The hotel was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of blocks from the Providence Civic Center . <p> Every whore in Providence had duplicate keys to the rooms , which caused the chambermaids trouble because they were the first to be accused of any thefts . This was bad enough , but it was also the hotel where the New England Patriots stayed on the nights before home games . They showed up in their limousines and sports cars at the last minute before the curfew . They had to follow a pre-game diet of some kind , but they often took racks of ribs into their rooms from House of Bar B Que and left a big mess . Claire was always finding a tray of ribs under a bed where someone had pushed it far enough out of her reach that she would have to use a broom to retrieve it . Checking under the beds was as important as changing the linens . People pay seventy-five a night and they think they have to be slobs to enjoy it . Then , the place was running with Pats fans and groupies leaving their fingerprints all over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarterback . <p> Claire had been doing well there for over a month . She had the linens and the vacuuming down to a smooth routine . She dusted last of all because the vacuum and the linens stirred the air , and if she dusted the TV and night tables first , she 'd have to dust again after she made up the bed . What she hated about the job she saved for last . The bathrooms were a wreck . She did n't mind the beer bottles , the Styrofoam trays from take-out places . She learned to stomach all kinds of refuse , even what they left in the toilets , sometimes etched across the tries . What she hated was the hair . Lu , the woman who broke her into the job , spent a long time teaching Claire how to deal with the hair . " There 's all kinds of hair , " she told Claire , " and there 's various ways of dealing with it . Hair likes to cling to the tries , it 'll swirl around the doorjamb and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corners and crevices and the only way you can get it all is to wipe everything down top to bottom . " <p> Claire spent most of her time in the bathrooms chasing these hairs . <p> " No one likes to rent a room , come into the can and find a hair on the sink or in the corner there , " Lu warned her . Lu told her , " Hair is worse than shit . It hides on you , it collects , it do n't stink so you ca n't track it down . Then , wham , it 's out of control , it gathers its forces and you 've got big globs , wigs almost . Toenail clippings , they 're bad , you have to know it , but hair has its own mind . " <p> She told Stephen that she was disgusted by these hairs she had to wipe up . " I just think how many more there will be tomorrow . " <p> " It keeps growing when you 're dead , " he said . <p> " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Some of that hair could be from a dead man , a zombie , " Stephen said . " They had some murders there , last year , remember ? " <p> " Lu would have had those hairs by now , " she told him . She surprised herself ; she felt admiration for the woman who had trained her to wipe up the hairs . A few times a week , Stephen came over to the Marriott on his lunch hour . She would find a room where somebody had just checked out . There would still be steam in the shower . An odor of after-shave or stick deodorant would be in the air . The bed was a wreck from whoever slept in it . It was no longer occupied , yet it seemed filled by these strangers . Stephen did n't mind . He liked these lunch hours with Claire . He sometimes had her on the floor and she could n't help seeing the Kleenex , the candy wrappers , that she would be picking up later . She studied the shag carpet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The following Sunday they had The Providence Journal and their pencils . They did n't talk to each other as they read the tiny print and marked the descriptions of possible jobs . Claire looked over at Stephen and watched his eyes descend one column and then another . <p> " Here 's something , " Stephen said , and he brought the newspaper up close to his face . <p> " What " <p> " This sounds like a dream ! It 's fight down the street . We could walk to work , " he said . <p> " Where ? What kind of place ? " <p> " The Cheaters ' Club . It says , Couple Wanted to Manage Night Club . " <p> " That 's a strip club , " she said . " Is n't that right ? Is n't that the place with the little stage and the runway right up the bar ? " she asked him . She watched his face . It was lighted by something , an idea or a belief . <p> " They probably need people to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the back room has video games , pool tables , I think . It 's small , it 'd be okay . It would be kind of fascinating , do n't you think ? " <p> " Have you been there ? " she asked . <p> " A few times , " he told her . " There was n't anything wrong with it . " <p> " I did n't know you ever went in there . Is that a twenty-four hour place ? " <p> " You can look in from the sidewalk , " he said . " Tell me you have n't looked in . " <p> They decided to go down there and see the place before applying for the positions advertised . She told him she wanted to see if it was going to be something she could n't adjust to . She was willing to consider the opportunity , she was n't going to be a prude about it , she told him . <p> " Let 's talk to the current staff members , " she said . <p> He laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " They 're homely girls , pathetic really , wiggling around when they could be taking a typing test at Kelly . " <p> " You want to be their boss ? Why do they need a couple ? " she asked him . <p> " Look , it says they want a couple , a morn-and-pop idea maybe . We could do it . It 's just like a regular place . It 's just a public awareness problem , we could improve that . " <p> She did n't want to see any strippers , but she did n't mind if he saw them . She was curious , she wanted to see him seeing the strippers . She was n't ashamed of this . <p> The club was crowded with men who stood facing the horseshoe bar which circled an empty runway . The men kept their jackets on , their hands in their pockets as if they were waiting in a bus terminal and studying the arrival and departure screens . Claire sat down next to Stephen at a small table near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticed her lover remove his jacket . He put the jacket in her lap . " Hold this , " he told her . This alarmed her . It was bold of him to admit he was settling in . He looked pretty comfortable there ; he sighed , as if he were giving in to something . Once or twice he lifted his arms over his head to stretch . He was trying to curb some kind of anticipation . <p> They drank some bourbon and Stephen said he would order a better brand if he was manager . " This is like a razor , " he told her . He pointed to an imitation Tiffany lamp which hung over the bar . " It 's cracked , see ? We 'll have to replace that . " <p> She put her arms in the sleeves of his jacket , but the lining was icy . Then the houselights dimmed and Stephen 's face deepened . A spotlight fell on the stage and washed over Stephen 's profile and farther into the crowd . The pale blue light reminded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see young boys on the boardwalk at night as they strutted back and forth beside the sea . Their faces changed color and became violet under the purple bug lights . Then she remembered the sound of flies and mosquitoes when they lit on the electric grill above the shooting gallery . She even thought about that , how it was impossible to win a stuffed animal at those places . <p> The show started . A girl executed a slow and delicate cartwheel onto the runway and into the circle of blue light . She was wearing a United States Olympic Team sweater . She danced to the right and to the left and then she did some somersaults . She made gestures like a swimmer and then she pretended she was throwing the shot put . When she pulled the sweater over her head , her breasts lifted higher and higher until the sweater was off and her breasts jiggled in small circles , falling back to their appropriate level . The girl folded the sweater neatly and placed it to one side of the runway . Then she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panty hose . <p> " She 's cute , " Stephen said . <p> " Sort of , " Claire said . <p> " No , I like the idea . " <p> " What idea ? " she asked . <p> " The Olympic theme . " <p> He was admiring the stripper from a distance ; he even tilted his head back a little as if to understand her better . He seemed pleased by the ten feet of space between himself and the girl because there was no way he could touch her . There was no way she could meet his eyes for he was outside the illuminated circle . Claire saw how the stripper would never be able to identify Stephen at any future point in time . Claire looked at the girl on the stage . The girl 's eyes seemed blank like those girls before their sewing machines in archive photographs of sweatshops during the Industrial Revolution . She smiled haphazardly in one direction or another , into the dark . Soon , the men started to give the stripper money . They inserted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood in a row and the girl assisted them when they hesitated . She stood at the edge of the bar and she turned her back on the men . She stretched , bent over , touched her toes and waited . A man put some dollars against her skin , in the cleft of her buttocks , behind the tight triangle of nylon . <p> Stephen did n't join the men at the bar . He kept his cash in his wallet . He did n't wish to pay that girl a dollar . He could be showing some respect for the girl ; on the other hand , he might be trying to get something for nothing . When the music stopped , the girl walked off the stage . There was scattered applause and a wave of discussion regarding the girl 's talent . Stephen applauded the stripper . He said to Claire , " That girl is making a living . " <p> " What are you saying ? " <p> " I mean , she 's doing something . You could work this hard for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he told her . <p> After some time , she had to use the lavatory . She stood up from her chair . Her bones felt light , her spine lifted , straightened like a wing . She recognized it , a sensation when her flesh wished to ascend , to escape a sudden heaviness of thought or weight of comprehension . <p> " I have to use the ladies ' room , " she said . He nodded his head at her . She saw that he was holding his chin and rubbing his shave as he watched a new girl on the stage . He smoothed his palm over his face and chin in a new dreaminess she had n't seen before . <p> On her way to the lavatory she passed the dressing room where the girls were arranging their costumes . She stopped when one of the girls looked up at her and smiled . <p> " Where 's the john ? " she said . <p> The stripper told her how to get to the lavatory and that one of the toilets did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They all used only that one toilet , the girl said . <p> Claire thanked the girl , but the girl had turned away to help another get dressed . They used pliers to pull a zipper . " Getting it up is one thing , getting it down is a scream . Every guy has to give it a shot , " the girl said . <p> " Do they get it down ? " Claire asked . <p> " Only after I 'm stuffed with loot . Then I decide when . " " Oh " Claire was smiling " it 's a trick ? " <p> " A technological miracle , " the stripper said , " that 's what I 'd call it . " " There 's a lot of science in this , " one of the other girls said . <p> " It 's not just bump and grind . It has to do with centrifugal force . Centrifugal force is behind every move you make . <p> " Claire laughed with the women . <p> " I bet you 'd like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They all turned to watch her face . <p> In the lavatory , she noticed the roach tape along the baseboards . She saw it the way an accountant follows the diagonal line through graph paper . For some reason she could not urinate . That part of her body would n't open . Maybe it was something to do with the tear in her bowel which did n't seem healed . She stood in the bathroom for a moment in front of a tiny mirror which framed only her eyes . Seeing her eyes like that without the rest of her face was very unnerving . Her eyes revealed something which her mouth , her lips , would have erased with a quick smile . <p> When she came back to the table there was another girl on the runway . They said her name was Pepper , but Claire had seen the girl earlier and they had called her by another name . Pepper had red hair . She wore her G-string low and she had combed a little of the red frizz over the tight border of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of the red hair . The men kept thinking up new names and everyone laughed . Claire thought of the rabbit with the twenty names . Stephen laughed also , a short , disciplined bleat which sickened Claire . <p> Something horrible was beginning to happen . She felt her feet begin to hurt inside her shoes . She tried to concentrate on this remote , faraway discomfort . <p> " You know , " she told him , " I do n't really want to be an assistant manager in this place . " <p> " Are you serious ? " he said . " It looks tame as kindergarten . There 's no trouble in this place . I 've seen some of these guys in Sears . " <p> " So what ? " <p> " It 's not a rough spot , " he said . " We could do it . " <p> " I do n't feel any desire to be doing this , " she told him . <p> " Well , I could do it on my own , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for a living ? It 's not my idea of a real life 's work . " She looked at him . He was trying to look back at her , at her face , but he followed the act . Then he looked straight at her and told her she did n't have to be part of the plan , she might not be included in his decision-making . He was n't forcing her into it . <p> Behind the stripper there was a screen with projections . Slides of sandy beaches and slides of pinto horses alternated . Claire watched a single moth follow the cone of light back and forth , from one end to the other . It landed again and again on the screen . Once it became the white eye of a horse , then the slide flipped and it was gone in the foam of the sea . Finally , it came forward , drifted above the red hair of the stripper , and its shadow grew monstrous against her . <p> <p> By Maria Flook <p>       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
