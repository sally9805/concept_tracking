<p> The striking eryngiums add drama to borders and dried arrangements <p> Staunchly upright , armed to the teeth , and boldly beautiful , sea hollies remind me of Highlanders guarding my borders.With their spiny leaves and bristling , thistle-like flower heads , it 's hard to think of these plants as cousins to delicate Queen Anne 's lace or airy fennel , yet they are indeed members of the Apiaceae ( formerly the Umbelliferae ) . Like so many of their relatives , eryngiums ( e-RINJ-ee-ums ) adapt well to dry gardens and enjoy full sun and moderate soil . Many are hardy in all but the northernmost gardens . A handful will grow almost anywhere . <p> Whether perennial , biennial , or annual , all eryngiums have blossoms like thimbles surrounded by multirayed bracts . Long lasting in the garden and as cut or dried flowers , eryngiums are ornamental for much of the garden year . Their foliage , often long , lobed , and dramatically spiky , can be nearly as decorative as the flower heads . <p> Though only a handful of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species occur throughout the Americas , Asia , and Europe . ( For no apparent reason , maritime and mountain eryngiums are called sea hollies , while eryngiums from steppes and plains are referred to as eryngoes . ) In most species , the shape of the basal leaves differs from those on the flower stems . In European , North African , and Central Asian species , the basal leaves are rounded while the stem foliage is usually lobed or divided and often heavily spined . North and South American species look more like yuccas or agaves , with swordlike , strappy foliage edged in sharp needles . <p> True sea holly , Eryngium maritimum ( USDA Zone 5 ; to 1 ft. ) , is seen more often growing wild along the eastern seaboard than in gardens . This is curious , because this species is handsome and hard-blooming , with broad bracts that are attractive for months . Its ornamental qualities are shared to some degree by the whole clan , but the loveliest of the lot are the alpine sea holly , E. alpinum ( Zone 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This progeny includes a mixed but garden-worthy family of hybrids lumped as E. Xzabelii , and its natural child , E. xoliverianum , a particular favorite of many gardeners . <p> Alpine sea holly boasts the showiest flowers in the clan . Large and arrogantly upright , the plants look like Elizabethan nobles , their long heads encircled by elaborate ruffs . As with most eryngiums , it makes a splendid dried specimen ; as the shimmering , steely blue color drains away , the leaves and stems turn a rich tobacco brown , then bleach to the silvery gray of old cedar . <p> Native to the European alps , E. alpinum blooms from late summer into autumn . The species itself is less common than garden forms such as E. a . ' Blue Star ' ( almost navy blue ) , ' Superbum ' ( sapphire ) , and ' Amethyst ' ( ruddy purple ) . They all partner well with supple , soft-edged companions such as the cream variegated maiden grass , Miscanthus sinensis ' Variegatus ' , or fluffy , shell-pink Ceanothus ' Marie Simon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as Hydrangea ' Blue Wave ' or purple hazel and ornamental onions like Allium schubertii or A. ' Globemaster ' , whose spherical seed heads balance the insistently linear sea hollies . <p> The hybrids called E. xzabelii ( Zone 5 ; to 2 ft. ) were popular border plants early in the century . Many are lost to cultivation , yet a handful of dazzlers remain , all with richly tinted flowers and flaring , intricately cut bracts . Sea-blue ' Slieve Donard ' ( also sold as ' Donard Blue ' ) and red-purple ' Violetta ' are the most common . Both combine nicely with rugged Rodgersia aesculifolia and any of the fine-textured love grasses ( Eragrostis spp. ) , or the rosy , gilded plumes of squirrel-tail grass ( Hordeam jubatum ) , which will tumble like spun silk around these structural sea hollies . <p> An elegant natural hybrid , E. xoliver-Janurn ( Zone 5 ; to 3 ft. ) has dark blue cones and big bracts of a lustrous , pewtery blue that suffuses the stems in midsummer . In one memorable planting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gold ' , xSolidaster ' Lemore ' , and blue rue ( Ruta graveolens ' Blue Beauty ' ) . <p> The silvery giant sea holly , Eryngium giganteum ( Zone 4 ; to 4 ft. ) , would also look well in that setting . Often called Miss Willmott 's ghost ( a suitable tribute to Ellen Willmort , a rather prickly doyenne of English gardening at the turn of this century ) , this short-lived biennial or perennial is generally grown from seed , since the fleshy roots resent disturbance . It was said that Miss W. scattered the seeds wherever she went , leaving hundreds of round-leaved seedlings in her wake . No matter whether this story is or is n't true , the virtues of this striking plant are undeniable . Its structure stiffens shapeless plantings , and its silvery sheen adds a rich contrast to masses of green foliage . <p> Another group of sea hollies have smaller but profuse blossoms on open , airy plants . The blooms of Mediterranean sea holly , E. bourgatii ( Zone 5 ; to 2 ft. ) , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moon . They emerge in stiff sprays above basal foliage softly streaked with silvery veins . In twilight-colored ' Oxford Blue ' , central cones like chubby pincushions are circled by long , slender spines . These can be playfully echoed by an underplanting of thready golden Deschampsia flexuosa ' Tatra Gold ' . <p> Rock-hardy amethyst sea holly , Eryngium amethystinum ( Zone 2 ; to 2 ft. ) , is popular in northern gardens where its tender kin freeze . The clustered blossoms are slim-rayed as pale blue stars and glimmer against lavender-blue balls of Allium christophii and coppery carexes . The tiny heads of Eryngium planurn ( Zone 4 ; to 3 ft. ) rise like sheaves of blue buttons amid the sunny border . Native from Russia into the steppes of central Asia , this one remains dignified and decorative in lean soils and full sun , but loses its poise in lusher conditions . Named forms include pale turquoise ' Blue Cap ' , glittering ' Blue Diamond ' , and icy ' Silver Stone ' , all of which explode in little starbursts during much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positions , E. xtripartitum ( Zone 5 ; to 4 ft. ) carries its wiry , aluminum-blue flowers on leggy stems . The blue-green bracts are beautifully set off by a backdrop of dusky purple hazel . <p> Similar company suits Moroccan mountain eryngo , E. variifolium ( Zone 5 ; to 2 ft . ) . This one has a vicious grace . The foliage is heavily spiked , and the bantam-blue cones are ruffed with long and glittering spines . The basal leaves are shaped like rounded hearts , toothed and crinkled , and where winters are mild , they remain glossy all year . The vivid , creamy veins stand out beautifully during the quieter months . <p> Only a couple of the American eryngoes are at all common in gardens , probably because these are rugged individualists that do not mingle gracefully with billowing border beauties . Give them a place of their own , whether as specimens in a sweep of gravel or in a large container by terrace or pool , and their architectural qualities shine . American eryngoes can be used successfully in boldly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Big grasses , tall prairie compass plant ( Silphium spp. ) , and bear 's breeches ( Acanthus mollis ) are able companions that can match their potency . <p> North American rattlesnake master , Eryngium yuccifolium ( Zone 4 ; 3-5 ft. ) , is a dry-country plant that thrives in difficult settings . Its broad , almost succulent-look-ing leaves are blue-gray and edged with stubby spines . Tight sheaves of ice-green flowers with diminutive , grayish bracts hug the sturdy stems , giving the plant a rather severe profile . Grow it by itself in a pot or give it dramatic companions such aschartreuse Euphorbia wallichii or black and purple Euphorbia dulcis ' Chameleon ' and sunny golden feverfew ( Tanacetum parthenium ' Aureum ' ) . <p> The eryngiums adapt well to any open , sunny , well-drained site including , not surprisingly , seaside locations . They accept a wide range of conditions , including some truly dreadful soils . Knowing the provenance of the species you want to grow makes it easier to position it appropriately . While maritime and plains species are highly tolerant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less so . However , all deliver the best garden performance when given reasonably fertile soils , adequate moisture , and reasonable elbow room for growing . When their modest needs are met , they provide a long season of beauty , from the time their metallic , blue-gray foliage emerges in spring to season 's end , when the ornate seed heads rattle in the winter wind . <p> PHOTOS ( COLOR ) : In addition to their sculptural qualities , eryngiums add rich colors to the border . Among the best in this regard are E. Xtripartitum ( left ) and E. xzabelii ' Slieve Donard ' ( right ) . <p> PHOTOS ( COLOR ) : Far left : Miss Willmott 's ghost ( E. giganteum ) is a striking foil to almost any plant . Near left : The dramatic rattlesnake master ( E. yuccifolium ) deserves a stand-out position in the border or in a container .
