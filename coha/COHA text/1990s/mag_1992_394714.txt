Structure pervades the universe . Everywhere astronomers look , they see it . Anyone who goes outside on a clear night and gazes at the sky can see the most obvious structure . The planets and stars  --  distinct points of light surrounded by the blackness of space  --  confirm that matter clumps together more in some regions than in others . As astronomers probed deeper into space this century , they found new levels of structure . Stars clumped into galaxies , and galaxies clumped into clusters . Within just the last two decades , astronomers have discovered that the clusters of galaxies themselves clustered into superclusters , which are separated by huge and apparently empty voids . Structure seemed to be everywhere , except at the largest and most distant scale of all . When astronomers observed the cosmic microwave background  --  the remnant radiation from the big bang that gave birth to the universe  --  it appeared extraordinarily smooth . There was no hint of any structure at all . Everyone agreed that there had to be some irregularities in the otherwise featureless background , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form the galaxies , but no one could find them . Until now . In late April , a team of astronomers led by George Smoot of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and the University of California announced that the Cosmic Background Explorer satellite ( COBE for short ) had discovered tiny variations in the temperature of the microwave background . According to Smoot , " These small variations are the imprints of tiny ripples in the fabric of space-time put there by the primeval explosion . Over billions of years , the smaller of these ripples have grown into galaxies , clusters of galaxies , and the great voids in space . " AN HISTORIC FINDING Speaking for many astronomers , University of Pennsylvania cosmologist Paul Steinhardt stated that if this finding is confirmed , it would rank as " not only one of the most important discoveries in cosmology , but one of the most important discoveries in science in this century . " Yet this momentous discovery is based on just the tiniest variations . The ripples are actually minuscule differences in the temperature of the background radiation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 2.73 kelvins ( 2.73deg Celsius above absolute zero ) , the ripples represent deviations of just 30 millionths of a degree . That 's equal to 1 part in 100,000 of the total signal . The ripples appeared in observations made with COBE 's Differential Microwave Radiometers . The six radiometers have been observing the sky continually since COBE 's launch in November 1989 . The discovery comes from data collected during the first year of the satellite 's life . In that time , each of the six radiometers collected roughly 70 million measurements , for a total of nearly half a billion measurements . Then the computers went to work . Alan Kogut , a team member at Goddard Space Flight Center , says " Each of those measurements is like one piece of a gigantic jigsaw puzzle  --  you look at the piece by itself and it could mean anything . It 's only when you fit all 70 million pieces for each of the radiometers together that the pattern starts to emerge . " The astronomers analyzed these measurements statistically to get the results . Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point to any specific area of the sky and say , " Yes , this spot is one part in a hundred thousand hotter than that spot over there , " it is a tried-and-true method for getting more sensitivity out of an instrument . Team members did n't announce results immediately , however . They kept it to themselves for a year or more so the data and the computer programs could be checked , re-checked , and checked again . They wanted to be sure they were seeing a cosmic signal and not a spurious one . And now , they are as sure as they can be . WHAT IT MEANS The discovery is far more than a single piece of the cosmological puzzle . It provides direct support for the theory of inflation , which proposes that the universe expanded extraordinarily fast for a brief period just after the big bang . It also supports the cold dark matter model of how the universe 's observed structure arose . And even more importantly , it eliminates a large number of competing models . The big bang theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the galaxies are flying apart from one another and that the farther away a galaxy is , the faster it moves . But if the universe were expanding as this suggested , then at some point in the distant past , all the galaxies would have been much closer together . The big bang theory states that the entire universe was once packed into a point of infinite density and extraordinarily high temperature . The big bang created not only the universe and all the matter in it , but also the space that makes up the universe and time itself . As the universe expanded , it cooled . But for a long time , the temperature was too hot for atomic nuclei to capture electrons . Photons of light could travel only short distances before interacting with free electrons . Then , when the universe 's temperature fell below 5,000 kelvins roughly 300,000 years after the big bang , atoms formed . With electrons tied up in atoms , radiation could travel freely , and the universe became transparent to light . This is the light astronomers see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the radiation no longer has a temperature of 5,000 kelvins . Instead , the expansion the universe has cooled the radiation to just 2.73 kelvins . BEAUTIFUL , BUT INCOMPLETE For such a simple theory , the big bang theory works amazingly well . It explains the expansion of the universe . It predicts the correct abundances of hydrogen and helium , the two most common elements in the universe , which formed in the first few minutes after the big bang . But perhaps most impressively , it predicts the microwave background radiation . When Bell Labs researchers Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson detected this remnant radiation in 1964 , astronomers quickly hailed the big bang as the best game in town . Despite its power , the big bang was too simple to be a complete theory . It offered no reasons for many of the observed properties of the universe . For example , as astronomers examined the microwave background radiation , they found it to be incredibly isotropic  --  it appeared to have the same temperature no matter what direction they looked . But the big bang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material in one part of the universe could communicate with material in a distant part of the universe so that they could reach equilibrium . Inflationary models easily explain how matter and radiation reached equilibrium . First developed by MIT physicist Alan Guth in 1980 , the inflation theory proposes that shortly after the big bang ( 10 sup - 35 second , or 10 trillion trillion trillionths of a second , to be exact ) , the universe underwent an exponential expansion that increased its size enormously ( by a factor of 10 sup 50 ) . Before that time , the universe was small enough that widely separated parts could reach equilibrium , and that equilibrium persisted after the inflationary epoch ended . What motivated inflation , according to Steinhardt , was an a posteriori prediction , or " postdiction . " In other words , we had observations that could n't be explained under existing theory , so we developed a new theory that could explain them . Though inflation made predictions , no experimental confirmation existed . As Steinhardt recalls , " A number of cosmologists got together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And we discovered the surprising prediction that inflation leaves behind some inhomogeneities , or ripples , in the universe , and these ripples have a characteristic spectrum . " The important thing about the COBE results is that the ripples agree with this spectrum , at least within the first limits that the researchers found . That 's the first prediction , rather than a postdiction , made by inflation to be confirmed . " WANTED : MATTER , COLD AND DARK COBE 's results also support the contention that lots of " dark matter " exists in the universe . In fact , as much as 90 percent or more of the universe may be in the form of dark matter , which is unlike ordinary matter and can be seen only through its gravitational effect on ordinary matter . ( See " Shedding Light on Dark Matter , " February 1992 . ) Smoot says the temperature and size of the variations discovered by COBE agree with theories of dark matter . " Theory tells us that these vast regions can not be composed of ordinary matter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laboratories . If it were ordinary matter , which interacts with light , then we would see much greater temperature variation . Only matter that does not interact with light except through gravity could cause such slight temperature variation . " Dark matter can take many forms , but the COBE results seem to point toward cold dark matter as the best candidate . Cold dark matter consists of slow-moving , massive particles that can gravitationally bind together fairly easily to form the seeds that subsequently draw in ordinary matter . Other possible seeds bandied about by theorists include hot dark matter ( faster moving cousins of cold dark matter ) and various defects in the topology o space called textures , cosmic strings , and domain walls . Paul Steinhardt explains the significance of COBE 's findings : " What COBE has done has , first of all , produced results that are consistent with the basic outlines of inflation and are consistent with the cold dark matter picture . And , as it now stands , COBE has wiped out the texture scenario entirely . It 's also wiped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wiped out all of the cosmic string scenarios except for those where you have strings plus hot dark matter . " WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS The COBE results are impressive , but everyone involved cautions that they need to be confirmed . That confirmation may come sooner rather than later . Balloon-borne experiments and telescopes at the south pole are looking for these same variations and achieve nearly the same level or sensitivity as COBE . In addition , there 's another year 's worth of COBE data for Smoot 's team to analyze . The confirmation may come within the next year or so . Steinhardt thinks that within a year we 'll either see that something has fooled COBE or have confirmation . If it is confirmed , Smoot says , " Our results will unify physics on the largest and smallest scales , fusing together the fields of particle physics and cosmology . " When that day comes , we 'll all know a lot more about how our universe got to be the way it is . <p>         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
