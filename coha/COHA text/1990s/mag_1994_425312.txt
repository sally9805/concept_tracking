<p> Saving the world 's cultural resources from decay and loss will require a cooperative effort among scientists , politicians , and the public . <p> Man fears time and time fears the pyramids , " has , in our own time , become an obsolete statement . Pyramids , temples , and tombs are joining the list of extinct species , along with ancient sculptures , paintings , paper , textiles , glass , and ceramics . Their degradation over the centuries and millennia is due to both natural and anthropogenic phenomena . Both nature and man have caused catastrophic destruction , as well as incremental damage . <p> Cataclysmic events such as earthquakes , volcanic eruptions , floods , and fires are unexpected and often disastrous . Pompeii , even after its replication by computers , will live forever in our memory as the victim of Mt . Vesuvius . As recently as 1982 , the eruption of E1 Chichon in Mexico deposited a layer of highly abrasive ash on a number of Mayan sites . <p> But natural processes of destruction by the elements can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perceptible from year to year . In the case of stone decay , the major contributor , carbon dioxide , has always been present in the atmosphere , as in pure rainwater , which is naturally acidic and will convert limestone ( calcium carbonate ) to soluble calcium bicarbonate . <p> The presence of salts in stone is another serious cause of mechanical and chemical pressures . Rising by capillary action , ground water and salt crystallize below the surface , causing tensile stresses and blistering , which often result in breakage of the material . <p> Natural concentrations of atmospheric ozone also erode stone and cause the fading of pigments used in works of art . In the enclosed spaces of caves , tombs , or museums , preservation requires adequate ventilation systems to reduce ozone exposure to safer levels . <p> While natural deterioration occurs in all environments and under different atmospheric , climatic , and geophysical conditions , the modes of decay vary regionally , depending on site-specific , intrinsic , and extrinsic factors . <p> Human-induced impacts have also been catastrophic and insidious , willful and accidental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Castle , and Zwinger Museum in 1945 was deliberate , the burning of the Library of Alexandria accidental . Caesar meant only to destroy Pharaoh 's fleet , not torch the famous library . But the winds carried the flames inland , causing the irreplaceable loss of one of humanity 's most precious legacies . <p> Less dramatic , but equally destructive to Alexandria and all modern cities today , is the relentless , daily pollution of atmosphere , earth , and water . Concentrations of carbon dioxide , sulphur dioxide and trioxide are directly related to the closeness of industrial zones and the high concentration of sulfur in crude oil used as fuel in industrial and domestic heating . To these are added concentrations of nitrous oxides released by automotive exhausts . The past half-century has witnessed a dramatic increase in cultural resource degradation-an acceleration which is rightly perceived as the result of human progress and achievement in industry and technology . Their corrosive impact on cultural resources is a worldwide phenomenon that requires a worldwide response . <p> Throughout the history of human progress and achievement , the attitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the world 's resources , natural and cultural , was man 's prerogative . And , if quarrying did not conflict with existing ideology or religious belief , then why not ? Why not indeed ? Did it matter if the casings of the pyramids  --  the shining white limestone that covered them and made them glisten as far as 15 kilometers away and that inspired the Greeks to name them  --  were ravaged 4,000 years later to erect mausoleums and tombs for the Mamelukes , the new conquerors of the pyramids ? It did not matter to them then . It matters to us now . <p> Nearly 200 years ago , humanity began to take a different view of " antiquity . " A beginning was made in the recognition of cultural achievement and a cultural heritage ; a beginning not al-ways launched by the national heirs of such heritage . The discovery of " Ancient Egypt " was made , not by Egyptians , but by the 164 scientists , mathematicians , naturalists , engineers , architects , antiquarians , epigraphers of the " Commission des Sciences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his momentous expedition to Egypt in 1789 . Their reports and 900 engraved plates , published . in Description de l'Egypte , offer a perception of temples and tombs that no longer exist : the paintings are gone , and today 's relics are the bleak , greyish , crumbling walls of what was once vibrant with life and brilliant colors . <p> Two converging movements of concern for nature and culture led , in 1831 , to the appointment of Prosper Merime as inspector for historic monuments in France and to the establishment , in 1872 , of Yellowstone National Park . International response to these concerns materialized , a century later , with the signing and ratification of the Montreal Protocol and the World Heritage Convention . <p> Response had already been initiated by UNESCO in the rescue of Abu Simbel and Philae temples , with contributions from some 50 countries and from other national and international organizations . Success of this campaign was followed by the rescue of Venice after the flood of 1966 and of Mohenjo Daro in Pakistan and Borobudur in Indonesia . The concept of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to translate conservation into an effective and permanent program , the input of scientific research had to be enlisted . In 1955 , no systematic study of atmospheric corrosion of stone was known , and as late as 1980 , scientists were admitting that they did not know much about " the complicated mechanisms of decay and the precise role of pollutants . " Nor were scientists in agreement about the significance of vehicular pollution in the cause of stone decay . Thus , existing scientific expertise and technology lacked the means to effectively and permanently treat degradation of cultural materials . <p> The immediate need now was to create the ability to address the issue of conservation accurately and to avoid well-meaning but faulty restoration , such as stone injections with epoxy resins and metal intrusions that inevitably fractured the very monuments they were meant to protect . <p> Venice 's woes and the Acropolis dilemma galvanized Europe 's scientific community and provided two forums for assessments of Europe 's and the world 's cultural heritage . The Athens Symposium in 1988 and Bologna Conference in 1989 focused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock mechanics , engineering , geology , and geomorphology , to atmospheric deposition , environment and microclimate , mural paintings and the management of risks to cultural property . " <p> This important multidisciplinary effort was the first step , and one that must be taken again and again , in the examination , analysis , testing , and monitoring of cultural resources based on the development of new technologies for conservation  --  technologies not initiated for industrial needs but for the prevention of stone erosion , loss of pigment , brittleness of paper manuscripts , glass , and other identified cultural resources . With " Eco-Archaeometry , " a new approach launched by professor George Burns , relevant disciplines were drawn together on an equal footing into a complementary effort to identify and quantify physico-chemical pressures that were causing the deterioration of cultural elements . <p> But implementation of scientific recommendations needs approval from decision makers , and conservation programs can not proceed without national legislation . Surprisingly , the extent of degradation and the many tragic losses of priceless cultural treasures had not been appreciated , in either developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After World War II and throughout the 1950s and ' 60s , an explosion of industry and commercial enterprises led to a flurry of construction . In addition , a massive influx of people into cities resulted in more destruction for the erection of residential buildings . Victims of such hasty construction were many exquisite examples of early 20th century Art Nouveau and Deco . The demolition of the Hotel Ruhl in Nice , described as " equal to the loss of Paris ' Eiffel Tower , " and that of the extraordinary brick-metal-glass structure erected in 1906 by Guitton on the left bank of the Seine , were two of the many irreplaceable losses of modern art and architecture . <p> In France , response came from the public sector with the adoption of the Patrimoine National . A name derived from the Roman " patrimonium " which , 2,000 years ago , ensured the legitimacy of familial inheritance , the French patrimoine was extended to encompass national inheritance . Questions arose regarding extent and legitimacy . Does protection of structure dictate present function ? Must an abandoned castle remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would help maintain it ? <p> Positive response ensured the survival of the Gare d'Orsay , the Paris train station that was slated for destruction but instead was transformed into the Musee d'Orsay , a beautiful and well-visited museum which today houses the Impressionist School of Art . In Washington , D.C. , the opening of shops and restaurants at Union Station no doubt helps to maintain the structure and its original function as a transportation facility . During the celebration of the tenth anniversary of " Doors Open " in September 1993 , 10,000 sites of France 's Patrimony were opened to an expected 5 million visitors . And here again , questions continue to address the inclusion of industrial and farming patrimonies and those of literature , landscapes , languages , and traditions  --  concepts so far difficult to translate in terms of public and private rights . <p> With prosperity and technological achievements came another unexpected form of destruction . Rapid and affordable travel combined with an expanded and inspired humanity , eager to visit , see , and touch remnants of the past  --  an enthusiasm in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lethal to culture and art . Daily intrusions of thousands of visitors , accompanied by an increase in humidity and temperature variations in caves and tombs , had devastating effects . <p> In the state of Chiapas , Mexico , the " Temple of the Paintings , " Bonampak , was , until its discovery in 1946 , safe from environmental degradation . An exquisite example of classic Mayan art , it soon experienced problems of fungal growths and salt crystallizations on the paintings . Control of humidity and removal of carbonate deposits and the color integration of the paintings by in situ conservation succeeded in stabilizing both indoor and outdoor conditions and helped save the temple . <p> In France 's Valley of the Vezere , the Upper Paleolithic cave Lascaux had preserved the artistic achievements of Cro-Magnon for 20,000 years until its discovery in the 1940s . International renown resulted in more than 100,000 visitors a year . The paintings began to show signs of deterioration and of microscopic fungal growths . Andre Malraux , France 's minister of culture , responded by closing the cave in 1964 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the public and the government , when opened to tourism in 1982 , the replica was an unexpected success . Today , outside Paris , " Lascaux 2 " is the second most visited monument in France . <p> In addition to restoration , replication , documentation , and monitoring , national legislation and proper management of cultural sites are prerequisite to the " sustainability " of the tourist industry and to the survival of both the national cultural heritage and the national economy . <p> In 1989 at the international conference on climate change held in Cairo , Egypt , NPCA President Paul Pritchard suggested that nations consider establishing world cultural parks to " safeguard priceless elements of mankind 's cultural heritage ; historically significant buildings and other antiquities which are being damaged by atmospheric pollution . " It is time to implement such resolution and to draw outlines defining the legal and economic guidelines aimed at the protection of world cultural parks . <p> The creation of a Ph.D . degree in conservation , encompassing all relevant disciplines , is another priority . With an acknowledged profession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empowered to make early detections that will provide their patients  --  hominid or lithic  --  with better chances of survival . Today , conservation must take precedence over excavation . As an archaeologist , I must deplore complaints such as , " research is curtailed for restoration . " If our interest is in the discovery and study of our ancient past , then the preservation of that past must be uppermost on our agendas . <p> Public awareness , through the print media , television , and film , can also serve the cause of world heritage conservation . Public awareness and public outcry against DDT and later against CFCs helped save the peregrine falcon and , as reported in the Washington Post , the reduction of CFCs is " allowing the stratospheric ozone level to heal itself . " NOAA 's James Elkins gives the following credit : " This is all driven by U.S. public opinion ... a beautiful case study , where science , the law , industry , and the public all worked together . " <p> Finally , I wish to suggest that , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the debt-ridden nations of the developing world , response to human health , education , and shelter are distinct priorities over the need to respond to the depletion of many of the world 's priceless legacies . A debt-for-culture exchange between developed and developing nations would provide assistance by transferring funds and technology to debtor nations , to be used for the support of cultural conservation programs . The host country contributes by converting debts to local currency , which is used to support programs of restoration , documentation , and monitoring , as well as to support agreed-upon projects . The creation of endowment funds would ensure continued protection and monitoring , and the cooperation in training and leadership of the host country would be a part of the exchange of debt for conservation . <p> In 1920 , American Egyptologist James Henry Breasted advised : " The supreme obligation of the present generation is to make a comprehensive effort to save for posterity the enormous body of ancient records still surviving in Egypt . " The same is true of records surviving worldwide . Under an accelerated deadline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and with natural and cultural resources under enormous pressures from an ever-growing population , we have a long way to go to reach this goal . But , with cooperation and a true sense of shared responsibility , I dare to hope that there is indeed a future for our common past . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Thousands of visitors flock to Egypt each year to see the Sphinx and pyramids .
