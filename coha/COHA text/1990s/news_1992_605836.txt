<p> Just a couple of years ago , Japan 's huge investment in American real estate was portrayed by some as a threat to American sovereignty and a blow to U.S. pride . As well-heeled Japanese bought up such national treasures as Rockefeller Center in New York City , there seemed to be no end in sight . <p> But in this desert playground of the rich and famous near Palm Springs , as well as in Los Angeles , Hawaii and other centers of the now-busted real estate boom , some Americans are emerging as the wily horse traders while the Japanese appear to have been snookered . <p> American land owners and developers , it now appears , profited from the Japanese buying spree , unloading their excess real estate to the Japanese , often at inflated prices . <p> " I expected much more out of the Japanese than they in fact showed , " said Christopher Mead , a Phoenix consultant who has tracked Japanese investment in U.S. real estate . " We thought that because they beat us in one field after another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But they did n't . It was n't the Japanese who took advantage of the Americans ; it was the other way around . " <p> Yukuo Takenaka , a Los Angeles investment banker who has many Japanese clients , said many Japanese firms misread the U.S. market , assuming that real estate values would rise just as steadily as they have for years in Japan , where land is relatively scarce . Their appetite for property , meanwhile , was whetted by the cheap credit available in the late 1980s from Japanese lenders . <p> The most-publicized loss to date has been that of Minoru Isutani , the Japanese developer who reportedly lost more than $ 300 million during his brief ownership of the Pebble Beach golf complex in Monterey , Calif . But dozens of lesser lights have taken their lumps as well , suffering a sharp decline in the value of their U.S. holdings , while posting sizable operating losses in under-utilized hotels and commercial office buildings , according to brokers and real estate analysts . <p> In the Palm Springs area , several Japanese investors who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are ailing . <p> GGS Co. , which owns the Hyatt Regency Suites and the Rancho Mirage Country Club , has filed for bankruptcy in Japan . <p> And Maruko Inc. , the Tokyo-based real estate company that bought the Hyatt Grand Champions golf and tennis resort here in March 1990 for $ 66.8 million , is in bankruptcy court proceedings in Japan and the United States , and would be lucky to recoup half its initial investment , according to an independent appraisal . <p> The seller in that deal : the U.S. Resolution Trust Corp. , the federal agency responsible for disposing of the assets of failed savings and loan institutions . <p> When Maruko bought the property , it seemed to some observers like a steal . The price tag was far less than the more than $ 100 million it had cost the developers . <p> The end of the Southern California real estate recession may yet make the price paid by Maruko look like a bargain , but that will be small comfort to Maruko . <p> In filing for bankruptcy protection from its creditors in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listed roughly $ 2 billion in liabilities worldwide . <p> Maruko owes Riverside County here more than $ 2 million in property taxes on the hotel , having missed its last three payments dating back to December 1990 , according to the Riverside tax collector . <p> The firm was something of a late-comer to the U.S. real estate frenzy , though by the time of its bankruptcy filing in Japan last August the company had acquired some three dozen major properties around the United States , including hotels in San Bernardino , San Francisco , Los Angeles and Hawaii . <p> It now appears that the value of Maruko 's properties have declined anywhere from 20 percent to 40 percent from the prices originally paid , according to knowledgeable sources . <p> Japanese companies traditionally take a long view when investing , relying on patience and the deep pockets of their bankers to tide them over . <p> But in this case , experts say , Maruko appears to have made a number of miscalculations . <p> Some suggest that it may have been motivated by intangible factors , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was originally built by a development partnership that included former tennis star Charles Pasarell and comedian Alan King . <p> The cost drained the partnership , and it defaulted on its main loan from Gibraltar Savings &; Loan of Simi Valley , Calif . <p> The property wound up in the RTC 's portfolio after federal regulators seized Gibraltar in March 1989 . Maruko bought it a year later . <p> Guests at the 34-acre retreat can swim in any of four pools , play tennis on the 12 grass , clay or hard courts , or golf on the two adjacent 18-hole courses . <p> The hotel is surrounded by palm trees and impeccably manicured gardens , and its back veranda offers a stunning view of the nearby San Jacinto and San Bernardino mountains . <p> Its 10,000-seat tennis stadium became the site of the annual $ 1 million Champions Cup professional tournament . <p> During peak season , a suite at the Grand Champions can cost as much as $ 375 a night , while a two-bedroom villa runs $ 925 . <p> Donald Wise , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Estate Group Inc. , recalled an unusual meeting with the manager of Maruko 's Los Angeles office shortly after the firm purchased the Grand Champions in 1990 . <p> Wise asked a fairly pointed question about the rate of return Maruko demanded on potential hotel acquisitions . " He did n't have an answer , " Wise said . " He said , ' We 're not looking at that . We 're more interested in the aesthetics ... what a building looks like . ' <p> " Quite frankly , I thought I was in the twilight zone . The purchases were not driven by economics . There was some hidden agenda . " <p> The Maruko executive involved did not respond to written questions this week . <p> In an interview with The Washington Post in Tokyo , Maruko deputy trustee Eiji Katayama noted that the " hotel slump was spread all over America and did not affect only Maruko . " <p> He added that the Grand Champions had been acquired after a change in Japanese tax laws reduced its attractiveness to Japanese investors who had been counted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ founder and chairman , Shoji Kanazawa , Maruko gained a reputation for helping smaller , middle-class Japanese investors buy real estate  --  typically condominiums or hotels  --  through such syndications . <p> Maruko would usually guarantee a fixed rate of return to these investors , pocketing the difference if returns were better than expected , or making up the difference if the property did n't generate the necessary cash , according to Robert Gilberg , an attorney who represented Maruko in many of its transactions in the United States . <p> Gilberg is now on the other side of the table from Maruko as the chairman of the creditors ' committee in the bankruptcy case . He said Maruko owes his firm more than $ 800,000 in unpaid legal fees . <p> Maruko 's approach was apparently successful as long as money was cheap  --  4 percent interest rates were the rule in mid-1980s Japan  --  and tax incentives were available to potential Japanese investors . <p> According to its 1990 report , Maruko had net sales of more than $ 1 billion , and operating profits of $ 106 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affected by rising Japanese interest rates  --  which increased the cost of its bank loans  --  and by finance officials ' efforts to rein in speculative real estate investments . <p> Maruko 's fate was sealed last August when the firm 's major lender , Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Co. , approached Maruko executives about a Japanese-style " workout " of its problems . <p> In several similar situations , lenders have quietly taken over the operations of troubled Japanese real estate companies . But in this case , Kanazawa balked at Mitsubishi 's terms and the bank quickly cut off Maruko 's line of credit , precipitating its August bankruptcy filing . <p> Kanazawa was removed from senior management and several court-appointed trustees are now running Maruko from Tokyo . <p> Kanazawa and other Maruko executives clearly had high hopes for the Grand Champions , based in part on the company 's simultaneous purchase of 32 acres of adjacent vacant land on which buildings with an additional 450 to 500 rooms and 80,000 square feet of meeting space could be constructed , according to Richard D. Cortese , the hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought an excellent project , " said Mayor Richard Oliphant of Indian Wells , who recalled meeting with Kanazawa and other Maruko executives shortly after the purchase . <p> " They seemed to show great pride in their properties in Indian Wells . ... They intended to enhance them and add to them , " said Oliphant . <p> At the resort , life goes on pretty much as before . Lincoln Town Cars and Mercedes Benzes drive past striking arrangements of red bougainvilla flowers along the main driveways to drop off guests in front of the elaborate water fountains . <p> " It 's all a matter of perspective , " said Jack Barthell , a managing partner in the Los Angeles office of Kenneth Leventhal &; Co . <p> " Maruko bought the resort at a discount from the RTC . It looked like a smart buyback then , and it probably would have been if they had the financial horsepower to get through the cycle . But they did n't . Now it looks like the RTC was pretty smart . "
