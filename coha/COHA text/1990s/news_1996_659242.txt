<p> No survivors , no explanations , no hope on Mother 's Day . <p> Authorities on Sunday called off the search for possible survivors of the crash of ValuJet Flight 592 , which nose-dived into the Everglades with 104 passengers and five crew members . <p> " One hundred and nine mothers ... are not doing too good right now , " Bill Boland muttered to a fellow ambulance driver at midmorning . <p> Divers discovered the plane 's two engines Sunday and reportedly found a chunk - 20-to-30- feet wide - of the aircraft . Police sources said the first body parts were found late in the day . <p> National Transportation Safety Board officials said they were unaware of any bodies found and police refused to comment on the reports . But the medical examiner 's office got a call late Sunday afternoon to send vans to the site . <p> Pilots in the DC-9 reported smoke in the cockpit shortly after takeoff for Atlanta and attempted to turn around . The jet crashed about 15 miles northwest of Miami International Airport after being in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smoke was unknown . <p> Tapes of the conversation between a male crew member and the airport tower indicate there also was smoke in the passenger cabin , NTSB Vice Chairman Robert Francis said at a Sunday night news conference . <p> " As the conversation went on there was in the view of the controller and in the view of the people who listened to the tape ... a considerable sense of urgency on the part of the pilot , " Francis said . <p> Gregory Feith , NTSB investigator in charge , said the last intelligible transmission from the plane was the crew member 's acknowledgement of the plans to turn back , assignment of a new descent altitude and the location of the nearest airport . <p> The Atlanta-based discount airline has had at least three accidents since it began operations in 1993 . The most serious was a runway fire last year that destroyed a plane and burned a flight attendant . <p> The Navy will join the recovery effort Monday and use sonar equipment to try to determine how the aircraft appears under the murky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help locate the flight data recorders and help develop a plan to extract the plane , he said . <p> " It is very , very tough to figure out how we 're going to get the aircraft out from that swamp , " Francis said . <p> Possibilities included building a road to the site , draining the area or erecting a large stage where personnel could work . Francis said he did n't know how long the recovery effort would take or how it would proceed . <p> " I would certainly hope not months , " he said . " The chances we do n't recover the aircraft are very , very slim . " <p> Police spokesman Pat Brickman said searchers using wooden poles under the muck had found a piece of the plane 20-to-30 feet wide and up to 70 feet long , The New York Times reported Monday . However , the piece , believed to be the fuselage , could not be seen . <p> NTSB spokesman Mike Benson said late Sunday night he was not aware of such a discovery . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right engine closer to the point of impact . They do not expect to find large portions of the plane intact , Francis said . <p> Francis said much of the wreckage in the swampy waters is painted blue , which is the color ValuJet paints the rear of its planes , where the flight data and cockpit voice recorders are located . The devices are key to understanding what happened to the plane and what was said in the final moments before the crash . <p> The swamp yielded pieces of clothing Sunday , in addition to a family photo album and a floating airplane seat that were found Saturday . <p> Clearer pictures of the passengers emerged Sunday : a Baptist church organist and his wife on a dream vacation , a young man preparing for missionary work in his native Venezuela , a mother and her daughter who had become " real friends " in recent years . <p> Also among those on Flight 592 were San Diego Chargers running back Rodney Culver and his wife , Karen , of Woodstock , Ga . <p> " These are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jordan said of the victims at a Sunday morning news conference in Miami . " Every human being in every seat of the airplane is a life and a loved one with stories to tell , with friends , with places to go . It 's Mother 's Day weekend , we know that . " <p> Workers used stakes to mark a grid of the crash site of about 100-by-200-yards . <p> The wreckage was buried under waist-high water and layers of sawgrass and swamp muck - estimated to be up to 40 feet thick in places . Temperatures were in the mid 80s under steady , bright sunshine . <p> The Everglades - dubbed the River of Grass - is a desolate expanse of swamp covering much of southern Florida . The area is home to alligators , snakes and other wildlife and is accessible mostly by airboat . <p> Divers wore protective rubber suits after suffering irritated skin Saturday from aviation fuel and hydraulic fluid . They searched the muck by hand , unable to see more than a few inches in front of them in the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crash , but added there was no indication anything was wrong before the 27-year-old plane took off . A list of the plane 's past problems showed nothing out of the ordinary , he said . <p> Federal Aviation Administration records showed the crashed jet had returned to airports seven times over the past two years because of various maintenance problems , from an oil leak to loss of cabin pressure . <p> " I have reviewed the list ... and saw such things as overheating of a constant speed drive , a pressurization problem and a door ajar , " Jordan said . He said he found nothing " abnormal or shocking . " <p> The plane had a thorough annual inspection in October and a routine inspection four days before the crash . But the FAA began a special investigation of the airline in February based on the company 's rapid growth and several recent incidents . <p> The investigation examined " literally every plane , every route , " said Anthony J. Broderick , the agency 's associate administrator for regulation and certification . <p> Late Sunday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the following week has been moved up and will be extended to a full month . He also said the FAA would evaluate ValuJet 's heavy maintenance operations and send dozens of FAA inspectors to the airline 's 29 line maintenance facilities where minor repairs are done . <p> FAA inspectors also will ride in the cockpit of ValuJet planes over the next 30 days to review crew training procedures , use of checklists , dispatching and other areas . <p> " We welcome the FAA scrutiny , " ValuJet spokesman Robert Copeland said . <p> Jordan said : " If ValuJet had any reason to believe one of our airliners was unsafe , we would voluntarily ground it . I can assure you that the FAA , if it had any reason to believe it was unsafe , they would ground it . <p> Jordan defended his airline 's use of DC-9s that are often a quarter of a century old and of young pilots who are signed on at lower salaries than more experienced aviators . <p> Transportation Secretary Federico Pena and FAA Chairman David Hinson visited the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At a news conference near the site , Pena said despite the " very unusual " investigation into ValuJet , he was confident the airline was safe . <p> " Whenever we have found any issues , ValuJet has been responsive , they have been cooperative , they have in some cases even exceeded the safety standards that we have at the FAA , " Pena said . " I have flown ValuJet , ValuJet is a safe airline , as is our entire aviation system . " <p> Flight 592 's pilot , Candalyn Kubeck of Bedford , Texas , had nearly 9,000 total hours of flight time , including 2,073 hours with ValuJet and 1,697 as a captain with the airline , officials said . <p> " Very experienced , very well-trained , very competent , " Jordan said of the pilot . " There 's certainly no indication it was any responsibility of the flight crew . " <p> The first officer , Richard Hazen , a retired Air Force pilot , had 6,146 total flight hours , Jordan said . <p> ValuJet has a troubled history that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with 30 people aboard slid into a snowbank in January after landing at Dulles International Airport outside Washington , closing the airport for nearly three hours . No one was hurt . <p> A ValuJet DC-9 also skidded off an icy runway at Dulles in January 1994 , closing the airport for almost two hours . <p> And in June 1995 , a fire destroyed a ValuJet DC-9 on a runway in Atlanta . One flight attendant was burned and minor injuries were reported as the 57 passengers and five crew evacuated .
