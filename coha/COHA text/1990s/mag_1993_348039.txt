Q. It 's tempting to compare this moment in history to F.D.R. in 1932 or J.F.K. in 1960 or even Ronald Reagan in 1980  --  all watershed years . In terms of the task you face , which of these comparisons seems most appropriate ? <P> A. Probably somewhere between Roosevelt and Kennedy . The economy is not as devastated as it was under Roosevelt , and the changes we need to make do n't involve as much Big Government or Keynesian economics , but they are quite profound . There 's a sense that we need to get the country moving again . That 's what Kennedy brought to the White House . But structurally the things we have to do here at home are more profound than what we had to face in 1961 . <P> Q. You 've also been admiring of Reagan . <P> A. Substantively , the best thing he did early was to restore the country 's sense of confidence and optimism and possibility . <P> Q. Do you feel you have as much of a mandate to make changes as any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> A. I guess it depends on how you read the results of the election . If it had been a two-person race , the popular margin would have been greater , but the electoral margin might have been slightly tighter . It 's hard to calculate because some states were so close . I think what I have a mandate to do from the people who voted for Clinton and Perot , and some of the people even who voted for Bush , is to try to make the government work again , to strengthen the economy to solve problems , to represent the people at large rather than just the people who are organized and have great wealth . <P> Q. Did Perot make your task easier by getting people to focus on the fact that some of the solutions will be painful ? <P> A. Maybe . But another thing that was very helpful coming out of his campaign was this whole emphasis on political reform . When I became the nominee of the Democratic Party , in a country that had n't voted for a Democrat in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted political reform but were n't sure any Democrat could deliver it . So when Perot got the vote he got , that really gave me the impetus to stick with the political reform . I think this will open the system to making tougher decisions . <P> On the deficit thing , what was said helps people to think about making tough decisions . What they want is for ( ( the solutions ) ) to be fair and commonsensical . People understand more and more that at least over the long run , you 've got to do something about it . <P> Q. Are there some things that Perot proposed , like the gasoline tax , that you think might now be more palatable to the public ?
