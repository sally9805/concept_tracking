They were all there , all the Grand Old Men of the field : McKay , Kliest , Taranto  --  even Sagan , little more than an ancient withered husk in his electric wheelchair . But the fire still burned in his deep , dark eyes . <p> All the egos and superegos who had given their lifetimes to the search for extraterrestrial life . Often they had been derided by the media , scorned by the politicians , even scoffed at by their fellow scientists ; this was going to be their day . One way or the other . <p> Jupiter was going to reveal its secrets to them . Today . Life on another world at last . Make or break . <p> I could feel the tension in the room , like just before a thunderstorm , that electrical smell in the air that makes the hair on your arms stand on end . Careers would be made today , or broken . Mine included . That 's whey everyone was here , waiting impatiently , chattering nervously , staring at the display screens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The mission control center was a big room , huge really , but now it was jammed with bodies , hot and sweaty , buzzing with voices in half a dozen languages . The project scientists , all the top government officials , invitees like Sagan , hangers-on who inveigled their way in , everybody who thought or hoped they 'd capture some of the glory of the moment , and more than a hundred news reporters and photographers , all crammed into the mission control chamber , all talking at once . Like a tribe of apes , jabbering , gesticulating , posturing to hide their dreams and ambitions and fear . <p> They did n't want to miss the first images from beneath the cloud tops of Jupiter . Even if it killed them , they had to be at mission control when the probe 's first pictures came in . <p> Most of the reporters clustered around Sagan , of course , although quite a few hung near Lopez-Oyama , the center 's director . Our boss . <p> Beautiful Allie stayed at Lopez-Oyama 's side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pendulous breasts . I dreamed about Allie , saw her flawlessly naked , smiling at me willingly . In my waking hours I thought about her endlessly , picturing myself doing things with her that not even my dreams dared to imagine . <p> But she stayed beside the director , next to the power and the attention . I was merely an engineer , neither powerful nor glamorous . Still , I longed for Allie . Lusted after her . Even as she smiled for the photographers I noticed how she had artfully undone an extra couple of buttons on the front of her blouse . <p> " Imagery systems check , " droned the voice of the mission controller . The huge room fell absolutely silent . I held my breath . <p> " Imagery systems functioning . " <p> We all let out a sigh of relief . Me especially . The imagery systems were my responsibility . I built them . If they failed , the mission failed , I failed , six dozen careers would go down the tubes , six dozen frustrated scientists would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unmanned , of course . No astronaut could survive the crushing pressures and turbulent storms beneath the cloud deck of Jupiter . No one knew if our robotic probe was sturdy enough to reach below the cloud tops and survive . <p> Over the years , the earlier probes had shown that beneath those gaudy colorful swirling clouds there was an ocean ten times larger than the whole Earth . An ocean of water . Heavily laced with ammonia , to be sure , but water nonetheless . There was only one other world in the solar system where liquid water existed  --  Earth . We knew that liquid water meant life on Earth . <p> Did it on Jupiter ? <p> " Jupiter represents our best chance for finding extraterrestrial life . " Lopez-Oyama had said those words to the congressional committee that ruled on NASA 's budget , when he went begging to them for the money to fund our mission . <p> " Life ? " asked one of the Congressmen , looking startled , almost afraid . " Like animals and trees and such ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sitting on the edges of our chairs in the center 's cafeteria while the politicians decided if we lived or died . I had picked a seat next to Allie , although she barely acknowledged my presence beside her . She stared unwaveringly at the screen . <p> With a tolerant little shake of his head , Lopez-Oyama replied , " It probably wo n't be life as we know it here on Earth , sir . That would be too much to hope for . " <p> " Then what will it be like ? " <p> " We just do n't know . We 've never found life on another world before . " Then he added , " But if we do n't find life on Jupiter , then I doubt that life of any form exists anywhere else in the solar system . " <p> " Do you mean intelligent life ? " asked the committee chairwoman sharply . <p> Lopez-Oyama smiled winningly at her . " No , ma'am , " he said . " Intelligent life would be too much to expect . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Now , as the moment of truth approached , the scientists cramming mission control were busily spinning theories about what the cameras would find in Jupiter 's global ocean . They could n't wait for the actual pictures , they had to show how clever they were to impress the reporters and each other . A bunch of alpha male apes , preening and displaying their brains instead of their fangs . Competing for primacy and the attention of the news reporters who were clustered around them , goggle-eyed , tape recorders spinning . Even the women scientists were playing the one-upmanship game , in the name of equality . <p> To her credit , Allie remained quiet . She was as clever a scientist as any of them , but she refused to involve herself in the primate competition . She did n't have to . Her ranking in the hierarchy was as secure as could be . <p> None of them paid the slightest attention to me . I was only the engineer who had built the imaging system . I was n't a scientist , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machinery work . I 'd be ignored unless something went wrong . <p> To tell the truth , I paid damned little attention to them and their constant gobbling . My eyes were focused on long-legged Allie , by far the most desirable female in the pack . How could I make her notice me ? How could I get her to smile in my direction instead of clinging so close to the boss ? How could I get to be an alpha male in her lustrous eyes ? <p> " Data coming through . " <p> From nearly a thousand million kilometers away , my cameras were functioning . Had already functioned , as a matter of fact , more than ten hours ago . It took that long for the telemetry signal to travel from Jupiter to our antennas out in the desert . <p> Suddenly all their jabbering stopped . Mission control fell absolutely silent . The first images began to raster across the main display screens , line by line . Live , from beneath the endless cloud deck of Jupiter . <p> Each display screen showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green , red , infrared and even radar imaging systems . Despite all their theories , none of the scientists had been able to tell me which wavelengths would work best beneath Jupiter 's cloud deck . <p> I had asked them how much sunlight filtered through the clouds . None of them could tell me . Which wavelengths of sunlight penetrated the clouds ? None of them knew . I had to grope blindly and include as broad a spectrum of instruments as possible . <p> Now I swivelled my gaze from one screen to the next . The blue system was pretty much of a washout , nothing but a blur , as I had expected . The atmosphere must be filled with haze , a planet-wide fog of ammonia and sulfur molecules . <p> " That looks like wave tops ! " <p> The infrared image indeed looked as if it was plunging toward the surface of a turbulent ocean . Radar showed more detail . Waves , crests and troughs racing madly across the screen . A rough sea down there . A very turbulent , storm-tossed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said mission control . The probe was going to hit those waves . It was designed to sink slowly to a depth of about a hundred kilometers , where it would  --  we hoped  --  attain a neutral buoyancy and float indefinitely . <p> Of course , if we saw something interesting at a shallower depth the probe could eject some of its ballast on command and rise accordingly . The trouble was that it took more than ten hours for any of our commands to reach the probe . We had to pray that whatever we found would n't go away in the course of ten hours  --  just about a full revolution of the planet , a whole Jovian day . <p> I summoned up all my courage and sidled closer to Allie , squeezing slowly through the crush of bodies . They were all staring at the screens , ignoring me , watching the ocean waves and the streams of low-level clouds streaking past . Storm clouds , swirling viciously . <p> I pushed between Allie and Lopez-Oyama . Not daring to try to say anything to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and half-whispered , " I did n't think we 'd get much from the blue at this level . " <p> He was so short that he had to crane his neck to look at me . He said nothing just nodded in his inscrutable way . <p> Allie was almost my own height . We were nearly eye to eye . <p> " The infrared is fabulous , " she said . To me ! <p> " It is working pretty well , is n't it ? " Be modest in triumph . All the books of advice I had studied told me that women appreciated men who were successful , yet not boastful ; strong but sensitive . <p> " It wo n't work as well once it 's underwater , though , will it ? " she asked . <p> I suppressed the urge to grab her and carry her off . Instead , I deliberately turned to look at the screens instead of her cool hazel eyes . <p> " That 's when the blue or blue-green should come into its own , " I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the laser works , " said Lopez-Oyama . It was almost a growl . He was distinctly unhappy that I had stepped between him and Allie . <p> Mission control announced , " Impact in ten seconds . " <p> The whole crowd seemed to surge forward slightly , lean toward the screens , waiting . <p> " Impact ! " <p> All the screens went blank for a heart-stopping instant . But before anyone could shout or groan or even take a breath , they came on again . Radar was blank , of course , and the infrared was just a smudge . But the blue and blue-green images were clear and beautiful . <p> " My god , it 's like scuba diving in Hawaii , " Allie said . <p> That 's how crisp and clear the pictures were . We could see bubbles from our splash-in and light filtering down from the ocean 's surface . The water looked crystal clear . <p> And empty . No fish , no fronds of vegetation , nothing that looked like life in that ammonia-laced water , nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough yet , " grumbled Lopez-Oyama . If we found nothing his career was finished , we all knew that . I caught a glimpse of the congressional committee chairwoman , up in the special VIP section behind plate glass windows , staring hard at him . <p> For more than an hour we saw nothing but bubbles from the probe 's descent . The faint light from the surface dwindled , as we had expected . At precisely the pre-programmed moment , the laser turned on and began sweeping its intense light through the water . <p> " That should attract anything that can swim , " Allie said hopefully . <p> " Or repel anything that 's accustomed to swimming in darkness , " said one of the scientists , almost with a smirk . <p> The laser beam ballooned in the water , of course . I had expected that ; counted on it , really . It acted as a bright wide searchlight for me . I wanted to tell Allie why I had chosen that specific wavelength , how proud I was that it was working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her attention was riveted to the screen , and Lopez-Oyama pushed to her side again , squeezing me out from between them . <p> Lopez-Oyama was perspiring . I could see drops of sweat glistening on his bald spot . <p> " Deeper , " he muttered . " We 've got to go deeper . The ocean is heated from below . Life forms must be down there . " <p> I thought I heard a slightly desperate accent on the word " must . " <p> " Spectrographic data coming in , " announced mission control . <p> All eyes turned to the screen that began to show the smears and bands of colors from the probe 's mass spectrometer . All eyes except mine . I kept my attention on the images from the laser-illuminated sea . They were becoming cloudy , it seemed to me . <p> " There 's the ammonia band , " someone said . <p> " And carbon compounds , I think . " <p> " My god , those are organics ! " <p> " Organic compounds in the water ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to conclusions , " Lopez-Oyama warned . But his voice was shaking with excitement . <p> Allie actually clutched at my shoulder . " Can your cameras see anything ? " <p> The water was cloudy , murky , even where the laser beam swept through ; it looked like a thin fog , glistening but obscuring . <p> " The ocean 's filled with organic chemicals at this level , " one of the scientists said . <p> " Particles , " corrected another scientist . <p> " Food , " somebody quipped . <p> " For who ? " <p> " Deeper , " Sagan said , his voice surprisingly strong . " The organic particles are drifting downward . If there 's anything in that ocean that eats them , it 's down at a deeper level . " <p> The probe was designed to attain neutral buoyancy at a depth of a hundred kilometers . We were approaching that depth now . It might not be enough . <p> " How deep can we push it ? " Lopez-Oyama asked no one in particular . <p> Immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sweaty chattering apes . Earlier probes had been crushed like soda cans by the immense pressure of the Jovian ocean . But I knew that the probe 's limits were not only structural , but communications-based . The probe could not hold more than a hundred kilometers of the hair-thin optical fiber that carried its comm signals to the surface of the ocean . So even if it could survive lower depths , we would lose touch with it . <p> " What 's that ? " <p> In the hazy light , a dark shape drifted by , too distant to make out any detail . <p> " Follow it ! " Lopez-Oyama snapped . <p> Then his face reddened . It would take some ten hours for his order to reach the probe . In his excitement he had forgotten . <p> Allie turned to me . " Are the close-up cameras working ? " <p> They were . I gestured toward the screens that showed their imagery . The dark hulk , whatever it was , had not come within the narrow focus of either of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water , tinted sickly green by the laser light . <p> " Another one ! " somebody shouted . <p> This time the shape drifted past the view of one of the close-up cameras , briefly . We saw a bulbous dark dome , almost spherical , with snake-like appendages dangling from its bottom . <p> " Tentacles ! " <p> " It 's an animal ! Like an octopus ! " <p> I scanned the numerical data on the bottom of the screen . The object , whatever it was , was three and a half kilometers from the probe . And it was four hundred and thirty-two meters long , from the top of its dome to the tip of its tentacles . Huge . Fifteen times bigger than a blue whale . Immense . <p> " It 's not moving . " <p> " It 's drifting in the current . " <p> " The tentacles are just hanging there . No activity that I can see . " <p> " Conserving energy ? " <p> " Maybe that 's the way it hunts for prey . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . Inert . Unmoving . It drifted out of the close-up camera 's view and all the heads in the room swivelled to the wide-angle view . The dark lump did nothing to show it might be alive . <p> " What 's the spectrograph show ? " <p> " Not a helluva lot . " <p> " Absorption bands , lots of them . " <p> " Chlorophyll ? " <p> " Do n't be a butthead ! " <p> Allie was the only one who seemed to realize the significance of what we were seeing . " If it 's an animal , it 's either in a quiescent , resting phase . . . or it 's dead . " <p> " The first extraterrestrial creature we find and it 's dead , " somebody groused . <p> " There 'll be more , " said Lopez-Oyama , almost cheerfully . <p> I looked across the room at Sagan . He was leaning forward in his wheelchair , eyes intent on the screens , as if he could make something more appear just by concentrating . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blessed change , forgetting to ask questions while the underwater views of the Jovian ocean filled the display screens . <p> Then I looked at Allie again . Her lovely face was frozen in an expression of . . . what ? Fear ? Dread ? Did she have the same terrible suspicion that was building in my mind ? <p> It was almost another hour before we saw another of the tentacled creatures . The probe had reached its maximum depth and was drifting through the murky water . Particles floated past the cameras , some of them as big as dinner plates . None of them active . They all just drifted by , sinking slowly like dark chunks of soot meandering toward the bottom of that sunless sea . <p> Then we saw the second of the octopods . And quickly afterward , an entire school of them , hundreds , perhaps a thousand or more . The sensors on the probe went into overdrive ; the automatic analysis programs would count the creatures for us . We simply stared at them . <p> Different sizes . Lots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size of a whale can be called small . <p> " Babies , " Allie murmured . <p> A family group , I thought . A clan . All of them dead . There was no mistaking it now . My cameras showed them clearly . Big saucer eyes clouded and unmoving . Open wounds in some of them . Tentacles hanging limply . They were just drifting along like ghosts , immense dark shadows that once had been alive . <p> Time lost all meaning for us . The big mission control center fell absolutely silent . Even the most assertive and egocentric of the male apes among us stopped trying to make instant theories and simply stared at a scene of devastation . A holocaust . <p> At last Lopez-Oyama whispered , " They 're all dead . The whole fucking planet 's dead . " <p> Then we saw the city . A sort of collective gasp went through the crowded mission control room when it came into view . <p> It was a structure , a vast , curving structure that floated in that mighty ocean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Huge round ports and beautifully symmetrical archways , a gigantic city built by or for the immense creatures that floated , dead and decaying , before our camera eyes . <p> The numbers flickering at the bottom of the screens told us that the city was hundreds of kilometers away from our lenses , yet it filled the screens of the narrow-view cameras . We could see delicate traceries along its massive curving flank , curves and whorls etched into its structure . <p> " Writing , " someone breathed . <p> A dream city , built of alien inspirations and desires . It staggered our earthbound senses , dwarfed us with its immensity and grandeur . It was enormous yet graceful and entirely beautiful in an eerie , unearthly way . It was dead . <p> As it swung slowly , majestically , in the powerful ocean currents we saw that it was only a fragment of the original structure , a piece somehow tom off from its original whole . Jagged cracks and ragged edges showed where it had been ripped away from the rest of the city . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Easter egg shell , beautifully decorated , that had been smashed by some titanic unseen malevolency . <p> " War ? " someone 's voice whispered plaintively . " Did they destroy themselves ? " <p> But I knew better . And I could n't stand it . I turned away from the screens , away from the views of dead Jupiter , and pushed through the crowd that was still gaping stupidly at my cameras ' views . I was suffocating strangling . I had to have fresh air or die . <p> I bolted out the main doors and into the corridor , empty and silent , deserted by all the people who had crammed mission control . The first outside door I could find I kicked through , heedless of the red EMERGENCY ONLY sign and the wailing alarm that hooted accusingly after me . <p> The brilliant late afternoon sun surprised me , made my eyes suddenly water after the cool shadows inside the building . I took in a deep raw lungful of hot , dry desert air . It felt like brick dust , alien @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Jupiter 's mighty ocean . <p> " It 's all Mined . " Allie 's voice . <p> Turning I saw that she had followed me . The tears in her eyes were not from the bright sunshine . <p> " All dead , " she sobbed . " The city . . . all of them . . . destroyed . " <p> " The comet , " I said . Shoemaker-Levy 9 had struck Jupiter twenty years ago with the violence of a million hydrogen bombs . <p> " Twenty years , " Allie moaned . " They were intelligent . We could have communicated with them ! " <p> If we had only been twenty years earlier , I thought . Then the true horror of it struck me . What could we have told them , twenty years ago ? That a shattered comet was going to rain destruction on them ? That no matter what they had built , what they had learned or hoped for or prayed to , their existence was going to be wiped out forever ? That there was absolutely nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's cold , " Allie said , almost whimpering . <p> She wanted me to go to her , to hold her , to comfort her t he way one warm-blooded primate ape comforts another . But what was the use ? What was the use of anything ? <p> What difference did any of it make in a world where you could spend millions of years evolving into intelligence , build a civilization , reach a peak of knowledge where you begin to study and understand the universe around you , only to learn that the universe can destroy you utterly , without remorse , without the slightest shred of hope for salvation ? <p> I looked past Allie , shivering in the last rays of the dying day . Looked past the buildings and antennas , past the gray-brown hills and the distant wrinkled mountains that were turning blood red in the inevitable sunset . <p> I saw Jupiter . I saw those intelligent creatures wiped away utterly and implacably , as casually as a man flicks a spot of dust off his sleeve . <p> And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comet was heading inexorably for Earth to end all our dreams , all our strivings , all our desires . <p> ILLUSTRATION : Gulliver suddenly realizes that his sciatica has vanished completely . <p> <p> By Ben Bova <p> Ben Bova 's most recent story or The Magazine of Fantasy &; Science Fiction , " Inspiration " ( April , 1994 ) , was a finalist for the Nebula .
