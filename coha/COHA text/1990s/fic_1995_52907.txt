Everyone who came to the NICU shivered with pleasure and shone with pride : Nora and Dick glowed as they came through the airlock . Misha and Dolores , bounding to make their shift , grinned in mid-glide . Even Nicky and Nicola , who had been through this so many times they had won an award for reproduction , were cooing over their new son . And why not ? What greater pleasure was there than to be licensed as a parent and visit your tiny , red offspring until he or she was fat and pink enough to take home ? Brahms played incessantly while bright mobiles wobbled from monitor stands and the madonnas blinked serenely . All was right on the Moon . <p> Marina and Beaumont leaned forward so their faces , as bright with bliss as any of the other parents ' , were close to the dark bubble of Stefan 's isolette . Past their distorted reflections , they could see the dim shape of their son hanging upside down , his head huge , his tiny hands and feet twitching vigorously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two red tubes and one blue tube from the ECMO unit to the two arteries and one vein of Stefan 's umbilical cord . As visiting hours ended , Angela , the nurse practitioner , squeezed her ample hips between the crowded isolettes to check the madonna . When she smiled , her white teeth shone from her dark face almost as brightly as the expressions of the proud parents . Beaumont held up a tiny New York Mets jersey before his son 's still-sealed eyes . <p> " Is n't he beautiful ? " Marina said to Angela . <p> " He looks like a little deep-sea diver in there , " Beaumont said . <p> " He ? " Angela said . She reached forward quickly and checked the chart . Then she looked at the parents whose faces were full of confusion and fear and said calmly , " Oops ! " <p> " What do you mean , ' oops ' ? " Beaumont said angrily . <p> " If there 's something wrong with my baby , I want to know now , " Marina said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Angela said , " and I did n't see you come in  --  " <p> " Tell me ! " Marina said . <p> " Stefan 's been moved . He 's over there in number eighteen . This is Nazli Nazarian . I 'm sure she enjoyed your visit as much as Stefan would have . Sorry . " The tone sounded and visiting hours were over . <p> Life support systems were turned down in the compartments during sleep shift , and they felt as small and cold as igloos , but Marina sat up in bed , staring into the dark . The covers had slid down to her waist and her nipples were so hard they hurt . Beaumont 's hand touched her thigh . He stirred and asked her what was the matter . <p> " I did n't know my own child , " Marina said . " I could n't even tell what sex it was . This ca n't be right . " <p> " I 'm sorry we missed Stefan , too , Marina , " Beaumont said in his thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the babies are so young . Through the glass , they all look alike . " <p> " I gave Stefan life . I 'm supposed to be his mother but I do n't know anything more about him than a fish in a bowl . " <p> " He does look a little like a fish , does n't he ? " <p> " Beaumont ! " <p> " You 'd rather carry him ? " Beaumont sat up beside her and hugged his arms to his chest against the cold . " Seriously ? " <p> Marina did n't answer . <p> " We chose early delivery when we came to the moon . It 's the only way to have babies here , just like in space . Regular childbirth just is n't safe  --  " <p> " They 've never proved that . " <p> " Do you want to be the guinea pig ? After all the miscarriages the Japanese had on L-5 ? Besides , the real point about ED is that it sets you free . Makes you biologically equal to men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't it ? It 's one of the reasons we decided to come here , and for the money . " <p> " It 's unnatural . " <p> " We 're on the moon , Marina . Everything here is unnatural . " <p> Marina pounded her fists against her knees , one hard sudden blow that the cold made sting . " I am really upset about this , Beaumont . I think something is terribly wrong . " <p> Beaumont rubbed her knees for her to take away the hurt . " It 's a tradeoff , like everything else in life , a compromise . Every freedom has its price . " <p> She leaned against him and felt his skin was stiff with cold . " Tonight it seems like a high price . " <p> He put a thin arm around her shoulders . " Angela said he 's thriving . In a little while , he 'll be out of the isolette . You can hold him in the Growers-and-Gainers room . We 'll be his mom and dad . We 'll pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat his vegetables . Just like we planned . It 'll be all right . Really . " <p> He tried to draw her down under the covers , but she tensed up as if she were frozen . Finally , she said , " I 'm going back to the NICU in the morning before my shift . " <p> " That 's against policy . " <p> " But not against the rules . " <p> " I 'll go too . Now , come under the covers before you freeze . " She settled in next to him and pulled the crisp metallic hood of her pillow over her head . " Your mother told me you were stubborn , " Beaumont said . <p> She pressed herself against him . " You never listened to my mother any more than I did . " <p> " Good thing . " He held her in the curve of his body until they both were warm . <p> The nurse practitioner 's round black face drooped when she saw them early the next morning . " This may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood between the parents and the darkened bubble in which their son floated . <p> Beaumont said , " If he 's sleeping , we 'll just ogle him from a distance . " He was already wearing the cowl of his space suit and it made his face look even longer and thinner than usual . <p> " He 's all right , is n't he ? " Marina said and her hair shook slowly in the low gravity as she tried to peer past Angela . <p> " Actually , he 's doing a little less well than we would like , " Angela said . <p> " Less well ? " Marina 's small body twitched as if ice had been poured down her shirt . An IV pole rattled as she squeezed passed Angela and in between the crowded isolettes . On a stainless steel cart , in his plastic bubble of synthetic amniotic fluid , her son Stefan floated , aged twenty-two weeks . His limbs were still and his head hung down like a stone . <p> " There 's arrythmia , " Angela explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose mouths gaped . " His potassium is high ; the kidneys are shutting down . " The madonna whirred agitatedly , desperately trying to adjust Stefan 's electrolytes . <p> " How long ? " Marina said . She touched the bubble . It was warmer than her hand . <p> " Since last night , " Angela said . She put her large hands in the pockets of her lime-green scrubs and shifted her weight . Her white shoes gave a little squeak on the pink and blue linoleum tiles . " It 's very unusual . " <p> " I mean until he 's well , " Marina said . <p> Angela almost whispered , " Hours , maybe days . After that . . . " her voice became formal , as if taking its tone from the cool blue monitoring machines " . . . the unit will have to assess its options . " <p> " What does that mean ? " Beaumont said . <p> Angela looked at him angrily ; she was the one who had to do the dirty work . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Stefan ! " Marina shrieked . The other nurse looked up from the changing table . <p> " You hush , now , " Angela hissed . She put her fists on her ample hips . " Take your hands off the glass . You think he ca n't hear you ? " <p> " I want to stay with him , " Marina said . <p> " Impossible . " <p> " He 's my child . He came out of my body . " Her face flushed and wrinkled like a dishrag . <p> " I 'll call the union , " Beaumont said . <p> " Do n't you threaten me ; " Angela said . Then she sighed and turned up her pale palms . " I 'll see what I can do . " <p> Marina sat in a folding chair and watched the madonna 's needles twitch . She still wore her plastic-piped sub-suit . She had come directly from her shift without showering and she could smell her perspiration coming up through the collar . At the end of the unit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeker . The bentwood antique looked out of place and it sent a rhythmic creek through the NICU that gleamed and smelled of disinfectant . An alarm went off . Georgine got up with the premie in her arms and punched instructions into a madonna . " Wo n't poop , " she said quietly . Georgine 's plump face was white as a bleach bottle . <p> " Poor thing " Marina said and turned her eyes back to Stefan . <p> Marina could count the bumps of her son 's spine and she counted them over and over like rosary beads . His nose protruded and his large eyes were smooth-skinned spheres . At twenty-one weeks , Stefan 's skin was so transparent , Marina could see the dark red lines of his blood vessels pulse twice each second . The heart monitor traced its own thin red line that flared and subsided erratically . Numbers shot up the scale , then receded as the madonna intervened . Then shot up again until the madonna headed off another emergency . The labels on the dials meant little to Marina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she knew they said PAIN ! and DANGER ! and she knew it should not be a machine that protected Stefan , but her own encircling body . She felt an aching in her womb for the child she should be carrying there . She imagined Stefan inside her , nestled by her hips , floating under the dome of her taut belly and kicking with delight . Marina hugged her waist and leaned over . She brought her head close to his . Stefan reached out his hand ; he tried to reach through her uterus . The lids peeled back from his eyes and as he looked at her , his lips moved . A hand touched her shoulder and she snapped awake . <p> " Oh  --  sorry , " Marina said . <p> " It 's okay . Drink some of this . " Georgine gave her a cup of tea . <p> They stayed the night , one woman on her shift , the other on her vigil , and time crept by . Marina was half asleep when Stefan 's heart fibrillated and the monitor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live . The madonna 's LED 's simply went out and the roller pump stopped turning . <p> The company man 's demeanor was just right , serious but not somber , friendly but not familiar . A tall thin man in a crisply folded gray suit , he sat on the edge of his desk and listened attentively with his head tilted at just the right angle . When Marina sniffled , his long limp hand offered a tissue from a convenient box . When she sobbed , he gripped her shoulder with a cool touch . <p> " You 're very brave , Marina , " he said , his voice resonant and calming . " They say you stayed with little Stefan right to the end  --  and did n't miss an hour of shift besides . Now you 've filed for another license . You should get a commendation ! " He raised his hand magnanimously like a televangelist invoking the Lord . " Hell , if we can give a plaque for doubling the efficiency of a payloader  --  well , you know what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sea of Serenity more than a mining operation . It 's a community . <p> " Nevertheless , " he continued , folding his hands modestly on his lap , " we 'd like to defer your request for a while . Nature gives you time to come to grips with tragedy , but with our techniques , that interval shrinks to days . Your body is ready , Marina . As early as this afternoon , you could accept and carry a child the full twenty weeks  --  " <p> Her body become taut . " I want to ! I mean , I have a right to choose . " <p> The company man held out his hands . " Oe prevalent network protocol , the demand for such capabilities will increase , Ten Eyck said . Accugraph Corp . and Quadritek Systems Inc. are among the companies with similar offerings . <p> NetManage officials said NewtWatch 4.6 would ship by the end of this month for $495 . <p> NetManage can be reached at http : //www.netmanagwhere our lives are so inextricably intertwined . " She glared at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she wondered for a moment what kind of psychiatrist bills his kids must pay . His kids ! <p> " Please , " she said . <p> He reached for her hand and slowly , she gave it up . " The soul takes its own time to mend . We want you to give it that time , the way nature would . " His hands were twice as large as hers and damp , despite the climate control . <p> " We 're not saying ' no , ' Marina . Just ' not yet . ' " <p> Beaumont moaned , quivered , then settled on her with a sigh . With Beaumont at one-sixth his Earthly weight , Marina could hold him on top of her most of the night and often did . She breathed slowly , lifting him with each breath . <p> When he caught his breath , he said , " I like this part of your plan a lot , Marina . " He kissed the inside of her ear and she heard a loud popping sound like radio static . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What about pre-natal care and what about transfer ? You 're going to need help , and not just from me . " <p> Marina wiggled her hips so he would roll off . She turned to him , leaning her head on her arm , resting her face close to his so she could feel the warmth of his face . <p> " I did n't want to tell you , " she whispered , " at least until I had worked out the details . I 'm not going to transfer the baby . " <p> " What ? " <p> " I 'm going to have it myself . I 'm going to give birth . " <p> " But that 's impossible . " <p> " They tell us it 's impossible . And it 's true there are problems in space , in zero-g , but we 're on the Moon and there 's gravity here . " <p> A tone sounded from the air duct . It indicated that life-support was shifting to minimal , that the heat would be turned down and air flow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on rest-level rations or pay for full service . Beaumont pulled the thermal blankets up under his chin and thought over her answer . <p> " Then why would the company go through the expense of early delivery ? The NICU is the second most expensive medical technology available . Just the personnel involved  --  " <p> " Because it 's not an expense ; it 's a savings . I 've been thinking about this a lot . At twenty weeks , a woman barely shows she 's pregnant . She can do every aspect of her job . Then one Friday after work , she goes in for ED . A weekend to rest and she 's fit again for service . The company does n't lose a minute 's work and in an understaffed operation like this , that means real money . Sure , it costs them some hardware and consumables and they have to hire practs , but in the long run they increase their line workers . Wait a minute . " She called out , " Central ! Five more minutes full life support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fan clicked on again . " And half lights . Damn the money . I want to look at you when I 'm talking to you . " In the yellow light , she appeared propped on her elbow , the hood of the pillow encircling her face . The clock on the night table marked the cost . <p> Beaumont said , " It 's cheaper to get new workers from Earth , like they got us . " <p> " If they just want bodies , sure . But this way , they get people raised at company expense , according to company policy . And they get a population that ca n't work anywhere else  --  moon children have 60% less calcium in their bones . Those kids will be stuck here . The company says they are doing ED for us , that it gives women reproductive equality , that it 's the best thing since the ERA . I said it myself : Now we are truly equal , biologically as well as socially . I even believed I did n't want to go through pregnancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company does n't provide early delivery as a personal favor and I think I knew that even then . " <p> " You did n't say anything . " <p> " No , but when I sat up watching Stefan , I knew I 'd been fooling myself . And when he died , it hurt like I was being punished . " <p> " Renal failure killed him , Marina , not you . " <p> " But mostly , I 'm doing this for myself , Beau . I want to feel my baby kick inside me . I want to ache with it while it 's a part of me . And I want the pain of childbirth , maybe to make amends for giving up Stefan  --  " The fan stopped and the lights went off . <p> Beaumont 's voice came from a dark place beside her . " I 'm as much apart of Stefan 's life  --  " <p> " No man is , Beau , though it 's sweet of you to think so . " Under the sheets , she touched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want  --  to earn  --  this one . " <p> " You do n't have to . " <p> " Every woman does , Beau . That was the problem . " <p> " When are you due ? " said the company man . Instead of meeting her eyes , he ran a finger along one of his suit 's crisp folds and watched the fabric fall into place . Withholding approval , Marina thought . <p> " December . " Marina was sitting in the same deep chair feeling tiny as before ; he leaned over her again , perched on his desk . <p> " No one has ever attempted to give birth in lunar gravity before . After the tragedies of the zero-g miscarriages , the hemorrhaging  --  augh ! No one had the guts  --  pardon the expression . You 'll go down in history no matter what happens . You 're a small woman , Marina , but there 's a strength in you like steel . I knew it when I first saw you . " The hard stare in his watery blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as tight as a spring , Marina thought . <p> " You ca n't talk me out of this , " she said . " The contract spells out the benefits I 'm entitled to : the prenatal care , the maternity leave . " <p> " And a paid period of convalescence , of course . And when you 're ready to return to work we 'll provide day care until the child is of age . It 's not just a generous contract ; it 's the only one conscionable . Neighbors helping neighbors . " His deep voice was full of kindness . But he 's wringing his hands , Marina thought . That 's not in the manual . <p> " I was thinking I 'd like to raise him myself , too . " <p> The company man hesitated , then smiled agreeably . " What could be more natural ? " Then he wrinkled his brow , took his elbow in one hand and touched his lips with the forefinger of the other , as if doing calculations in his head . " With young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though , does n't it ? " he said . " Money . You 'll pardon me for talking like this , but I started out as an accountant . You and Beaumont will have to make do , but my wife and I made sacrifices when we were starting out . I still think those were the best years of my life . Of course , that was on Earth . What we so often overlook , Marina , no matter how long we are on Luna , is air . You 're not used to paying it 's deducted automatically from your check , but believe me it 's substantial . Look at your last stub . You 'll see that almost forty per cent  --  but that 's because we breathe all the time . I do n't see how Beaumont can support the air budget for the three of you . " <p> " Beaumont is with me on this . " <p> " A good man , Beaumont , by all reports . " He walked around behind her , a subtle threat , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the reason I wanted to see you was just this : If things get tough , I want you to know that we will be beside you the whole way . If you need us , we 'll be there . " <p> " What do you mean ? " <p> He stood close by her chair so she had to lean her head way back and his gentle voice came out of his lined old face like reassurance from on high . " Anytime you say so , everything can be put back to normal . We can forget the whole thing . " <p> " You mean my child ? " <p> The company man held out his hands . " Your child , yes . But ours , too , the way every child is part of his community . The usual way here is for the community , for us , to take care of him for you . Now , in many ways , you are simply taking care of him for us . But remember , we are always ready to return the favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open for her . The interview was over . <p> Nearly last in the line at the canteen , Marina reached for breakfast items listlessly . Morning sickness made feeding herself hardly worth the effort , but she needed to keep up her strength for her job and for her child . Her child : the thought gave meaning to her nausea . She took a bowl of rice crisps ( the bran flakes already gone , dammit ) and surveyed the commons while Max ran her card through the register . " Credit 's gettin ' a little low , " he said as he handed her the slip . <p> She waded among the tables to her usual spot where Eveline and Tom and Niti were dawdling over empty bowls . " You look great , " Niti said and got up . " See you later . " <p> " The more it shows , the better you look , " said Tom , pointing to her stomach and rising . " Come on , Evvy . " <p> Eveline hesitated . She looked at Marina , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antique politeness . " I 'll call you , " she said . <p> What else could she expect ? Marina thought . She sighed and looked at the bowl . Half-buffed by the crisps , a piece of paper was sticking up at her unsanitarily . She looked at it . Neatly printed in the register 's usual font were the words , " Get out while you can . " <p> Her hands shook so all through her shift , she kept on hitting wrong keys on the console . When she got three error messages in a row , she almost burst into tears . Her payloaders stood idle in the sun long enough for Carl to look over to her for a moment , then reach over and press her reset button . " Hang in there , " he said . <p> When she told Beaumont that evening . he paced back and forth across the compartment , a long step , a quick turn at the wall , then a long step back and turn again . " They 're jealous , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they want to do , but they 're afraid to cross the company . What I do n't understand is ' get out ' ? Where can you go ? " <p> " But what if it is a threat ? I 'd be a perfect target . " <p> " I 'll protect you , " Beaumont said , but neither of them could imagine how . <p> All through the checkup , Angela seemed nervous . First , she dropped the doppler head . When she bent to pick it up , she jostled the instrument tray with her hip . " What 's the matter ? " Marina said . <p> " Your blood pressure is a little high , " Angela said without looking at her . She fumbled with the drape from Marina 's knees and had to shake it out and fold it again . " Nothing critical  --  but I 'm going to have to recommend you take it easy for a while . " She smoothed the drape fussily . <p> " What do you mean , ' take it easy ' ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closet . " Avoid anything strenuous . Take a nap every afternoon . " She was so deep in the closet , her words were muffled . She could have been hiding in it . " Take some time off work . " <p> " Time off ? Beaumont is doing double overtime to build up savings ; we 're counting on my paycheck up to the 30th or 32nd week ! " <p> Angela dithered and fussed , while holding her plump arms close to her thick body as if bound at the elbows by ropes . " Under normal circumstances  --  be extra careful  --  and the radiation  --  " She would not look at Marina . <p> " But ca n't I just hang on another month ? I 've already arranged for Indira 's job when she retires ; I 'll be in the control tower then . What 's going on ? " <p> Angela 's accent was rich with history , of grandmothers who were inner city midwives , of great grandmothers many generations removed who comforted scared slave girls in labor , while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Partly , we do n't know what will happen to fetuses that are carried to term on Luna  --  or to their mothers . " <p> " What 's the other part ? " Angela looked to the side , then down at the floor and Marina could see that what the pract had to say was in direct conflict with her tradition . Marina said , " Angela , I 'm depending on you . You have a sacred trust . " <p> " I 'm doing everything I can do to make sure you come through okay . " She looked at Marina for the first time , her eyes wide and white . " That 's why I am preventing you from going outside for the rest of your pregnancy . " <p> " That 's eighteen weeks ! " <p> " Why do n't you get dressed now and go have some lunch . " Angela left the room quickly ; her rubber-soled shoes squeaked as she hurried away . <p> Marina called , " Angela ! " but as she gestured for the tech to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her hand . It said , " Follow the footprints to the orange door . " <p> Beaumont threw himself into the hammock as if he carried his full earthly weight . " So that 's it , " he said . " You 're on unpaid leave and we have one hundred and fifty ECU 's in the bank . Great ! " <p> " I 'm sorry . " Marina wondered why she was apologizing . <p> " Well , I ca n't work any more ; there are no more shifts available . " He stabbed at his calculator watch . " I make exactly enough from my overtime to pay for your air . " <p> " And we had been hoping to get ahead of ourselves . " <p> " Once you go into labor , the company will pick up the tab , same as usual , and after you leave the infirmary , well , I 'll keep my extra hours , I guess . " <p> " You ca n't go on like this indefinitely . Besides , I never see you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all . Once the baby 's born , I 'll put him in daycare like the other mothers . " <p> " I thought you wanted to raise him yourself  --  the two of us together , like back on Earth ? " <p> Marina raised her voice , " Well , we just ca n't afford to , can we ? " <p> " And there 's nothing inside , or part-time ? " <p> " Surprise : Indira 's decided to put in another year . I wonder how they screwed her out of her early retirement benefits . " <p> " Around here , the loopholes have loopholes . " <p> Marina sighed and said a little desperately , " Beaumont , we can always . just give in . I mean , we came up here with our eyes open . We knew transferral was the only way to have a family . " <p> " Stefan was my son , too . I know I can never feel the same pain , but  --  " Stefan 's photo looked down on them from the shelf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . " We made our plan . We 'll stick to it . " <p> On the way to the shower , Marina looked sideways at herself in the big mirror . Not " round , " she thought as she passed a hand over her abdomen . Taut , though . As she turned under the soapy water and scrubbed herself with the cloth , the steam got into her lungs and shortened her breath . Around her , vague outlines of other women soaped and stretched like scrupulous ghosts . Six months gone , Marina thought . A wet flank slapped against her briefly . " Sorry , " she said . A hand touched her back , but as she turned , she was pushed . She slipped a little on the grating of the floor . Other hands caught her , but they pushed her too . With the water slamming down like distant applause , she heard words  --  not shouts , but statements , not loud , but clear : curses , <p> " Yours made of gold ? " <p> " Endanger us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whore . " <p> With each curse , they passed her around like a medicine ball . She felt the long , slim muscles of the other women as she recoiled against their bodies . She felt the self . propagating hatred and with each shove she felt the inertia of the baby swinging inside her like the clapper in a bell . " Stop . STOP ! I 'm PREGNANT ! " she said , but her voice was lost among the other voices and the hissing showers and Marina stumbled farther with each shove until finally she fell heavily onto one buttock , felt her skin cut and her muscles bruise . She curled up on the rough grating expecting blows and kicks , but the women disappeared into the mist , left her sobbing in the sizzling fog . Slowly , she picked herself up . Slowly , she walked out to face them , but they were gone as if by magic , or more likely , by plan . In the mirror , Marina turned to examine her bruises , but a different mark caught her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow stickynote . Leave NOW , it said . She looked in the mirror and saw another sticker on her hip . This month or next  --  or NEVER ! , and on her flank , We do n't WANT you here . She had to reach around to peel a third sticker off her back . Beware the terminator , it said . <p> She was going to vomit . With a hand over her mouth , she rushed to dress , to get home , fighting back bile and tears . <p> " Who the hell is the terminator ! " Beaumont said . <p> In her reflection in the computer screen , Marina saw the skin sag under her eyes . Worry , she thought and waited for the topo map to zoom in on the coordinates she had found pinned to a pair of her briefs when they came back from the laundry . She touched SURVEY under the INFO menu and a window opened onto a text field . <p> " That 's where the old KREEP mine was , " Marina said . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and hurry . " In the upper left of the screen , ECU 's were accumulating like split seconds . The map was replaced by a photograph of the same region . <p> " Nothing , " said Beaumont and he slammed the table . Suddenly , the cursor took on a life of its own . It tracked over to the company logo in the upper left hand comer and pulled down the NOTEPAD . A window appeared with the words , " What 's keeping you ? ! Leave before the 15th or the terminator will pass over the colony . It 's too dangerous to go in sunlight . " <p> " Oh , that terminator , " Beaumont said . <p> " From airlock 3 , head north until you reach Sulpicius Gallus crater . Skirt its rim until you are heading due west . Go straight into the mountains . We 're expecting you . " <p> " Who 's ' we ' ? " Beaumont said . Marina shrugged and logged off . " Well , I know one thing : the company owns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system . " <p> Marina leaned back in the chair and curled an end of her thin black hair around her small , graceful forefinger . After a minute , she said , " What if there 's something going on ? What if there 's a refuge out in the Montes Haemus ? A group of women who escaped the company , went to the old mine and made a self-sustaining colony like we have here  --  hydroponics , solar energy cells , all stuff left over from the mine . " <p> " Why there ? Why not at the UN telescope or the Japanese mine ? Why had n't we heard about it ? " <p> " We 're hearing about it now . Before this , we were loyal employees of the company . We did n't need to know . " <p> Beaumont leaned on the computer desk and bent over Marina . His skin was lined from weariness , worry and overwork . " Does it make sense ? " he said . " A group of renegade mothers hiding out there ? And they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welcome ' sign ? " Marina shrugged . " If there are women out there , the company must know about them . " <p> " Maybe . " <p> " And if the company knows , they must be condoning it , silently maybe , but still . . . " Beaumont held out his hands . " What 's their purpose ? What 's the point ? " <p> " I do n't know ! " Marina covered her face and drew her hands slowly down . The fingertips revealed her creased forehead , her sandbagged eyes , her pale lips . She stared , looking for an answer in the pinpricks of the acoustic panel . <p> " They have to do something with me , do n't you see ? " she said . " If I have my baby here , it 'll mean anyone can do it and then they lose control . So they need a way to get rid of me , like a release valve . But if they even admit there 's another place to have children and live , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be born , how to staff the NICU , how to set a budget . Why give women a choice ? Most may still want early delivery , but some wo n't . And some may change their minds . Why should the company want to deal with all those contingencies ? Now everyone believes she 's been spared labor pains and possible tragedy . And they follow the manual in blissful ignorance . " <p> " Why do n't they just say ' no ' ? " <p> " And start a rebellion ? Better to let us think we are free . Better to kill us with kindness , " Marina said . <p> The lights dimmed and Marina stood wearily . " Let 's go home and rest , " she said . <p> Beaumont rubbed his forehead . " Suppose there is a refuge , how are you supposed to get there ? I ca n't imagine somebody will give you a ride in a rollagon . " <p> " I do n't know , " she said . She reached for his hand and saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I 'm supposed to escape . " <p> " That 's a long way in a space suit . What if you do n't find the place . You have to risk your life . " <p> " I do n't have to , that 's the point . If I go , then I 've proven my resolve and they could never have a person like me  --  " <p> Marina thought about the women in the shower . They knew about the refuge ; they had told her about it . But they had not gone . They had conformed , given in . Chickened out . That 's why they hated her even while they helped her . <p> " What if you do n't make it ? " Beaumont said morosely . " Will they let you die on the moon ? Will that be good for morale ? " <p> " A company doctor will do the autopsy . They 'll say my hormones went crazy . I ran off after some fantasy about a refuge for renegade mothers . Who 'd believe that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives because whether they believe the company or not , believing is in their interest . " <p> " I 'd tell them . I 'd make them believe . " <p> " The distraught husband of the maniac wife . The louder you talk , the crazier you 'll sound . If the company knows anything it 's how to cover its ass . " <p> " Wait a minute . That re . cans there does n't even have to be a refuge . It could just as easily be a trap , " Beaumont said . " Either way , the company gets rid of you . It gets what it wants . Control . " <p> Marina nodded and looked at the floor . <p> Beaumont embraced her and Marina saw his skin was gray as if in the past weeks , he had aged ten years . " If you ED the fetus , " he said quietly , his face close to her ear , " chances are it 'll be all right . We can go back to normal . But this other way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I agreed , but now the time 's coming . . . . " She could feel his trembling in her bones as he held her . " I feel alone already . " <p> " I do n't have to decide yet , " Marina said . She put her hand on his shoulder . The message had told her where to go , but not how she would get out of the colony . <p> Marina turned in her sleep and the crackle of her metallic pillow-hood stirred her closer to wakefulness . She had to decide , she thought . The baby moved inside her . Did it sleep , she wondered . Did it dream ? Her room was cold and silent ; the baby 's was warm and loud with the beating of her heart . It stirred again and she jerked as it gave her a kick . It wanted her to decide , too , one way or the other about its future . She felt it reaching out , straining , prying its way out of her womb . Its fingers curled around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she screamed . Where was Beaumont ? Maybe on his way to get Angela ; she had to be strong for just a few more  --  but then the baby pushed his shoulder past her cervix and she squirmed and screamed again . Her chest heaved and she felt hot and sweaty . She threw back the covers . In the dim light of her alarm clock 's LED 's she saw the baby half-emerged from between her legs . A boy ! He put his hands on the points of her hips and contorted his face and PUSHED down with his arms until his hips burst free from her cervix with a watery POP ! and Marina screamed louder even than before while the boy rolled off the bed . " Lights ! " Marina called , then , " Beaumont ! " and with her head swimming and her body drained , she rolled off the bed after her son . He was lying near the foot of the bed looking up at her . His eyes were a watery blue ; his face was long and lined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circle and she drew him to her breast . Her nipple went hard and a feeling of peace and accomplishment filled her as she gave suck to her newborn son . I did n't have to leave after all , she thought . We did it without the company 's help . and now we 're a fait accompli . They 'll have to make room for us . We won . She smirked as her son fed . If only Beaumont would get here to see this . <p> The baby snuggled and grew larger in her arms . Her nipple began to ache and now she knew that it was blood that flowed through her breast , not mother 's milk . The boy 's shoulders broadened and his legs grew long . She felt his tiny hand encircle hers with a damp touch . And with that touch , she felt herself shrink . Now she was the infant and the baby was holding her . The company man bent his head to her tiny breast , held her close and sucked hungrily . Blue shapes swirled before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs kick in one last spasm . And she felt herself fall . <p> Beaumont was beside her , calling her name , telling her to wake up . It was cold on the floor , the wall was cold against her bare skin , and the fan whirred to replace the stuffy air . The light hurt her eyes . " It 's okay , " Beaumont said as he held her . She felt the hairs on his chest move as he breathed deeply , sucking in the stale air . " You do n't have to go out there , " he said . " They ca n't make you . " <p> There was a knock on the door . She opened it to see the company man . He wore a gray LUNA BOOMS T-shirt and glasses aided his watery eyes instead of contacts . <p> " I 'm sorry about what happened , " he said and looked furtively up and down the hall . <p> " Happened ? " Marina said . " Did something happen to Beaumont ? " <p> " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man looked as if he were paging through the manager 's handbook in his mind ; his hands were flopping around trying to find the right gesture . " There 's nothing in the manual  --  " He held out a yellow notepaper . " These numbers will open the north airlock at 19:00 tonight , " he said quickly , tonelessly . " There is a suit in the locker . The override will be disarmed . " <p> " Where 's my husband ? " Marina said . <p> " I 'm not supposed  --  I do n't know how to say  --  " Finally , as if he had mentally thrown the book out the window , his hands fell to his sides and he said , " Good luck . " <p> The door fell shut and Marina ran to the telephone . She was still trying to get through to Beaumont when he came in and slammed down his bag . " Goddamnit ! " he said . " They dropped me . I 'm on straight time from here on in . " The second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shift laid off . Marina just stared at him , a sickness rising in her throat . " Beaumont , " she said and nothing else , but she held out the piece of paper the company man had given her . Beaumont fell into a chair . He covered his sobs with his big hand . <p> Outside the airlock , only earthlight eased the darkness . Marina looked up at the huge blue womb and wished it had a higher albedo . <p> She started slowly , the baby bouncing loosely in the basket of her hips . She lengthened her strides until she glided like a pregnant sprinter coasting in slow motion across the Mare Serenitatis . Her shoulder lights turned the black regolith gray . Any second , she expected to hear a voice order her back or a light from a jet sled to pin her . But her radio remained silent . Something tickled her nose and she realized she was sweating . All that extra weight , she thought . That other person . The baby fussed a little in her belly . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small boulder with all the grace of a battle tank . She heard her breath rush against her faceplate . She was panting . Finally , she had to stop and wait for the satellites to overfly . Her bladder burned and as she caught her breath , she relieved herself into her bag and the baby seemed to stretch out and relax . More room now ? she whispered . She checked the dial on her wrist . She was on course . <p> She found the crater rim by stumbling on it , the ground rising more rapidly than her suit lights showed . She turned left and moved slowly , carefully , feeling her way on the broken , sloping ground , stopping every time the polar satellite overflew to be sure she would be traveling due west . She was on her second bottle of oxygen and she felt like she was crawling . <p> Sound crackled in her helmet . " Shuttle to moonwalker , please identify yourself . " Marina turned and saw the running lights of a jet craft , coming on fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sub-orbital , she thought . He wo n't brake for me . She shut down her lights and continued to grope around the crater looking for the west . Do n't help me , she thought . Please do n't help me . <p> " Shuttle to moonwalker . Assume your radio is out . Hold your position ; I 'm sending for help . Mayday ! Mayday ! Man down on west rim of S. Gallus. 19 degrees , 30 minutes , 20 seconds north , 11 degrees , 40 minutes , 10 seconds west . Hang in there , buddy . " Marina saw the tail lights disappear over the horizon . She was still a little south of west , but she had to get away from the crater . <p> To the west , the ground was broken . She crept over the rocks in the dark , her shoulder lights out . Her stomach twisted with nervousness and the baby shifted uncomfortably . As she hauled the one hundred and thirteen kilograms of herself , her suit and her child up a slope , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to stop and let her suit cool her . As the mask cleared , the navsat made her still a little south of west . Before she started again , though , she checked the eastern horizon . <p> It glowed . Dawn was coming after her at two hundred and sixty-seven meters per second and she and her baby were without radiation armor . She scrambled away from the rocky rim of the crater . As the ground flattened , she lengthened her strides . She slanted northwest hoping she was getting close . She sprinted . She flew . <p> Dawn moves across the moon about as fast as a good sprinter . Marina had a good lead on the sun , but she did not know how fast she was going or where . She imagined herself running endlessly , through the mountains and onto the Mare Vaporum beyond , one foot in the shadow , one in the light , half a step ahead of the dawn . She was panting again . This must remain an aerobic exercise , she told herself , but no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Acidosis , she thought . Her oxygen was low and while her re-breather continued to filter CO2 , her lungs demanded more oxygen than they were getting . There were foothills on the horizon ; she could probably reach them , short of breath or not . But was the orange door there , or kilometers east or west ? They said she was expected ; they did not say they would come get her . <p> A pain shot through her abdomen and she remembered a curious fact from her training : acidosis could induce labor . She shivered and tried to keep up a steady pace and conserve her strength or she would give birth in her suit on the surface of the moon and mother and child would die in a spasm of pain . Where were the footsteps of the women who had come this way before ? <p> A male voice with an accent like Beaumont 's crackled in her ear , " Moonwalker ! Moonwalker ! This is rescue sled Delta Gamma Six . Do you read ? We are flying a spiral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beacon ? Talk to me , buddy . Do you read ? " <p> The foothills approached and the un-nourishing air rasped in her lungs . Where were the mysterious women who would save her and her child ? She saw them , bodies big as the hills , faces gray as the Moon . Their mouths moved but the sound they uttered was the shrill scream of the madonna 's alarm . Their arms stretched out . Their fingers slid into her belly and reached for her child . <p> The pain shot through her lower abdomen , a contraction . This is where her body at last would betray her . <p> " Moonwalker , do you read ? " <p> " Do n't help me , " she sobbed into her dead microphone . " Do n't take me back . " <p> Another spasm and the hills melted like cheese . The ground came up and struck her knee ; her vision was obscured by sand . For a moment she was unconscious , then the sun swept over her and its light glowed through her eyelids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The third contraction made her cry out . <p> " Gim me a sign buddy and I 'll get you home . People are waitin ' for you . This is rescue sled Delta Gamma Six  --  " <p> Weakly , Marina reached with her right hand to her left wrist . She had failed Beaumont and she had failed herself . She slid back the safety and touched the red button . She had failed her child . Her helmet rang with the white noise of the emergency beacon . <p> " Beacon read ! And . . . fixed ! We are locked on to your signal , moonwalker . Hang on , buddy , we 're comin ' to get you . " <p> " You 're awake , " said a woman 's voice . A round gray face leaned over Marina . " Do you speak Russian ? " <p> Marina moved her mouth , but words did not come out . " Take a sip of water , " the voice said . A plastic tube touched Marina 's lips . They were very dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here from Spassky . Her mother 's sedated . C-section , " the woman said like she was sharing a secret . " It would be good form to quiet him in Russian , I think , even if he does n't understand . We 're big on development here . " <p> Marina spat out the straw and said , " Where 's Beaumont ? " <p> " What ? " said the voice . <p> " What time is it ? " Marina 's heart sank as she realized Beaumont was on shift . <p> " It 's fifteen hundred . " The woman had gray streaks in her smooth brown hair . She moved slowly and seemed incredibly calm . " Roland 's not here , Marina . " <p> " Beaumont . But where  --  ? " <p> " You 're at Maculate Conception . " The woman wore a yellow polo shirt and baggy jeans , not hospital scrubs . " It 's a terrible name . We think of better ones all the time , but this one sticks . " <p> " But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressed my beacon . I failed . " <p> " We heard your signal and we came out to get you . We knew you were coming , but could n't tell when you 'd arrive . There 's no orange door , of course . The company puts up with us , but they 'd never let us have an orange door . That 's just something to picture , something to give you the courage to keep coming into the mountains . " <p> " The company knows about you ? But why ? " <p> " We 're an R &D; project . The company wants to know if it can switch to natural childbirth to save money in the long run . We have to maintain a plausible deniability , keep it from the stockholders , the government regulators , most of the employees , too . We ca n't have a beacon , either , but we can pick up yours . " She looked at Marina . " Why did you say you failed ? " <p> " The fetus  --  " <p> " Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pain ? I had a baby and I did n't feel a thing . " <p> " We used anesthetics ; it was an emergency procedure . " The woman looked at Marina . " It 's not the pain that counts , Marina . It 's what comes after . You have a beautiful baby girl . She 's about a month early , but she 's strong . When you hear her cry  --  " <p> " Where is she ? " <p> " Right there . " The woman nodded toward the foot of the bed . " Where else would she be ? " Weakly , Marina pushed herself up on her elbows , looked past the white hill of her knees and saw the crib . <p> " Can I  --  " Marino began , but then said firmly , " I want to hold my baby . " <p> " Of course . " The woman went to the crib and brought the child to her mother . " That 's what she 's for . " <p> Marina took the tiny bundle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fragile , helpless . It was the first time Marina had ever held a baby and she was a little frightened . The thirty-four weeker weighed as much as a cat ; her skin had a healthy pink glow . Marina looked into her dark eyes and saw Beaumont . She wanted to show him his daughter , and she hurt like she was being clenched in a huge fist because she could not . But she could almost hear his voice reminding her that every freedom has a price . <p> Marina called to the woman who was folding a sheet . " So we 're free here , right ? " she said . " Free of the company . Free ? " <p> The woman thought a moment , then nodded her head and shrugged . " Sure , " she said . " As free as anybody .
