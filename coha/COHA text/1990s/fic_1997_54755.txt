Had the pack mauled a gardener , or a guest , or a halfwit local boy , then perhaps their crime would have been hushed up , but they had turned on their master , old Rutget Hannover himself , and thereby earned their doom . <p> I had met Hannover only once , the day he came to GenTech to watch the demonstration and buy the dogs . I expected someone imposing , as if all his wealth and power would be manifest in a physical form sculpted from bronze , but Hannover turned out to be amazingly ordinary : short and paunchy with a receding hairline , skin the color of a mushroom , wispy fine hair , eyes glazed into a dull stare . Were it not for the retinue of security people and flunkies following him , he might have been mistaken for someone 's tax accountant . <p> He came to GenTech and impassively watched the demonstration . Two lab assistants hid in the woods beyond the buildings , one in an old drainage ditch to the east and the other in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pack was told to find one intruder , hold him and under no circumstances harm him . They raced like a single organism through the pines , catching the scent , panting from the chase until they reached the stream . They guessed the stream was a trick , searched out the scent , then hesitated when the scent divided in two . I told Hannover they had a decision to make . After moments , they split into two groups , Speaker and Toto and Lancelot heading west while Captain Eddie and Bo and Merlin charged eastward . Soon both intruders were brought to bay . Abstract thought , I told Hannover , decision-making powers and symbolic communication and , for Speaker at least , even the gift of speech . <p> So Rutget Hannover bought my dogs , paid enough to fund GenTech 's research for years , and took them to his summer retreat in Maine . I told myself it was only research , the pack nothing more than experimental subjects , oversized lab rats , but for days after they were gone I found myself reaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearing barks where there was only silence , finding my eyes unexpectedly misting over . <p> Years passed ; my work at GenTech brought me prestige and a professorship at the University of Michigan . The pack receded from my memory . Then the word came that my genetically engineered dogs had ripped open Rutget Hannover 's throat and had escaped into the mountains . I assumed they would be tracked down and killed . Instead , Rutget Hannover 's daughter sought me out and asked me to help her save the pack that had destroyed her father . <p> At first I thought she was a student . Blue eyes spaced wide apart , shapeless brown hair , pudgy frame , looking lost , she peered around the door of my office . " Professor Nelson ? " she asked . <p> " My office hours do n't start for another hour , " I said . " Come back then . " <p> " My name is Kara Hannover , " she said and stepped into my office . <p> " Oh . " <p> " My father " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm very sorry . " <p> She walked to the chair in front of my desk . My work had earned me a large corner office in the the newest wing of the genetic research building . The walls were white , the furniture new and composed of graceful curved lines , track lighting bright enough to wash out any shadows , the carpet plush and stain-free . With her torn jeans , baggy sweater and greasy hair she looked as out of place in my office as a weed springing from my carpet . <p> " I want to ask you for help , " she said . <p> " Miss Hannover , when your father came to me I explained the risks involved . Simple breeding is unpredictable enough . Large-scale genetic engineering is light-years beyond breeding in its risks . He understood , even signed a waiver . I 'm afraid .... " <p> She fished a cigarette from her jacket pocket and struck a match to it . <p> " Smoking is not allowed here , " I said . <p> She blinked at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the window , then shrugged her shoulders . She glanced around for someplace to put out the cigarette , finally decided on the wastebasket . I ignored the stench of the smoke , kept my mouth shut about the fire hazard . " You were saying . " <p> " They 're hunting the pack . They mean to kill them . If you came , maybe you could communicate with them . Help them . " <p> " I 'm sure the police do n't need my help . " <p> " I meant help the dogs . " <p> " I beg your pardon ? " <p> " They 're my friends . I want you to save them . " <p> I assumed she was still in a state of shock . " I 'm not sure I understand . They killed your father . You want to save them ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " I would have thought you 'd want them killed . " <p> She shook her head , slowly , sadly , a gesture she seemed all too comfortable with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought the pack home . I was n't allowed to play with them . He said they were only to be used for security at the summer house . They were too valuable  --  like his Pierce Arrow . But I could n't resist . I mean , dogs that can think and talk ! So I snuck into the kennel . Speaker was very kind to me . I think they were lonely . They spoke of you . " <p> I winced , remembering the old pandemonium when I entered the kennel : Speaker nudging my hand , Captain Eddie bullying the others away so that he could have the prime spot at my side , Merlin never able to stop himself from jumping on me . I missed Speaker most of all : the most human , the most gentle , the most loyal . " What did they say ? " I asked . <p> " They missed you . They said when you were alpha , they felt more human . " <p> " Alpha ? " I had always wondered how they viewed me ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their pack . Only alpha males do not typically sell their pack mates . " Go on , " I said . <p> " They became my friends . The security guards let me get away with it . No one dared tell my father . I took them for long runs . It was lonely at the summer house . No other children to play with , whole summers spent alone . I needed companions . Some nights we spent hours talking . " <p> " About what ? " <p> She shrugged her shoulders . " They 're very curious about humans . We do n't make much sense to them . They wanted to know about power , about mating , about technology . " <p> " You mean Speaker did . " <p> " Yes , but I think he spoke for the whole pack . " <p> " So tell me , if it 's not too upsetting , what happened to your father ? " <p> " It was my sixteenth birthday . " <p> Sixteen ? She looked as if she had seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My father liked to arrange special entertainment for his friends . One year he hired skywriters to write each guest 's name above the house . This year he used the dogs . He had two of his security people hide in the hills beyond the house . They were supposed to hide in two different places to challenge the dogs . " <p> I felt a twinge of guilt . <p> " He hired these little carts , sort of like golf carts , so the guests could follow the pack . The whole thing disgusted me. so I stayed at the house . " <p> " You did n't go ? It was your birthday . " <p> " Yes , but it was n't my party . It was his . The guests were his friends and business associates . I would have preferred no party , but he would not hear of it . So basically it was his birthday party . <p> " From what I understand they took off after the pack . When the dogs solved the puzzle , part of the guests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the others followed the second half . His party caught up with the pack just as the dogs tracked down their query . My father  --  he was drunk  --  cut a corner on the side of a knoll too sharp and tipped his cart over . It pinned his legs . Then  --  one of the dogs .... By the time the other guests reacted , it was too late . The pack took off for the hills . " <p> She reached for the pocket where she kept her cigarettes , then dropped her hand to her lap . <p> " Which dog ? " I asked . <p> " Speaker , " she said . <p> A hole formed where my stomach should have been . <p> " I 'm still not sure what you want me to do . " <p> " Come back with me . Help me track them down . Maybe you can explain what happened . Maybe there was a reason . Maybe you can save them . " <p> I shook my head . " I 'm deeply sorry for this tragedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If the police ca n't track the pack down , I doubt if we could . And even if we could , there 's no reason to think I 'd have any better luck then anyone else . " <p> Besides , I thought , they were obviously dangerous . <p> " I may know where they are , " she said . <p> " Where ? " <p> " When we are there I will tell you . And yes , you do have more of a chance to save them . You created them . You know what they are . And  --  he talked often of you . In a way , they saw you as their father . " <p> " I beg your pardon ? " <p> " It 's true . That 's how he talked about you . He said he wanted to see you again . " <p> " I ca n't . I have exams in a week and .... " I left the next thought unsaid . My position , my work , might be jeopardized if my name became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pack was my creation , but so far I had escaped involvement in the whole fiasco . <p> " I understand . I 'll go myself . " <p> " Not alone ? " <p> " Of course . " <p> " They killed your father . They 're dangerous . " <p> " They are my friends . " <p> " This is insane . " <p> " Yes , I suppose it is . " <p> She stood to leave , passed beneath the bright track lighting and left my office . She did not , however , pass from my life . The next morning I awoke thinking of her . As I left for my office , the thought of safely hiding away in my academic life while she put herself in danger nauseated me , hiding away while Speaker and the rest were hunted down . <p> As if the past seven years had never happened , I reached down to pet Speaker 's head , grasped only air . <p> Was the tragedy my fault ? Had there been something in the engineering I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn on Hannover the way overbred St. Bernards had once turned vicious ? If so , then my duty was to make sure they hurt no one else . She wanted me to help them , but I might help the police track them down . The thought of being their Judas made me feel as if hot metal impaled my gut . Maybe I could save them . Maybe I would destroy them . <p> By the end of the day all I wanted was to take some action , any action at all to end the war in my brain . I decided to track down Kara Hannover . <p> My knowledge of New England consisted of several conferences held within comfortable hotels , a guest lectureship at Johns Hopkins , and a frustrating day of maneuvering a rented car through rotaries in an attempt to find Cape Cod . I imagined the countryside as being a postcard , covered bridges and all that . <p> As I drove north from Portland , the landscape slowly took on a life of its own , far removed from my sentimental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rounded mountains , pine and fir covered , fog wreathed , dark despite the afternoon sun . To reach the Hannover estate , I drove a series of two lane roads , through small towns consisting of old frame houses , closed gas stations , rusting cars in fields like the fossils of armored prehistoric beasts . There was something mournful about those towns , something dark , as if behind the curtained windows unspeakable acts occurred , horrible urges drove men to banal acts of violence . <p> I have never responded all that much to nature . I could unlock secrets of the cell , but the composite beings and landscapes formed from those cells never struck a responsive chord in my heart . The country always seemed to me a place of narrow minds and crushing drudgery and lives wasted in a lack of ambition . <p> At last I drove up a paved access road and reached the estate of Rutger Hannover . Beyond the chain link fence , state police cars and pickup trucks were parked in the grass next to the three-story manor house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banshee cry of helicopter blades screamed above me . The helicopter swept across the compound , soared , headed for the mountains . <p> The death of Rutger Hannover was major news and an army of news trucks almost blocked the main entrance . As I drove past them , I kept my head down as if the reporters would recognize me and blare my name across their headlines . <p> The guard at the gatehouse directed me to a Captain Davis , whom I found barking orders at a squad of state police , Hannover security men and local volunteers . <p> Kara sat on the front porch steps , watching the men through a haze of cigarette smoke . She nodded at me , flicked her cigarette into the grass . The Hannover summer house was a three-story Victorian mansion large enough to be a hotel . Hannover had flown the thing from England and reassembled it here . <p> Captain Davis , squat and beer-bellied , eyed me as if I were one of the fugitive dogs . When I introduced myself , he said , " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> " You 're the one who made these hellish creatures . " <p> " Well , " I said , " I 'm not sure if hellish is the right word . " <p> " The Pope says it 's blasphemy , making animals in man 's image . " <p> " You 're Catholic ? " <p> " No , but I 'm Christian . " <p> His search party had formed a circle around me and stared as if ready to pounce at a signal from their Captain . <p> " I 'm here to help , " I said . <p> " We do n't need it , " Davis said . I expected him to spit tobacco at my feet , but he merely grunted . " They 're damned smart , but we 'll find ' em . The national guard 's combing the mountains right now . We 're taking to the farmlands to the east . Our dogs will track ' em down . We do n't need no help to put bullets through their brains . " <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . <p> " Damn right , " Davis said . <p> " Look here , " a civilian cradling a shotgun said . " Can these dogs breed ? " <p> " Depends on whether Hannover had them neutered . " <p> " ' Cause they 've been loose for days now . If they 've screwed some of the local dogs , then God only knows how many monsters they 'll breed . " <p> " It does n't quite work that way . " <p> " I hear it does , " another man snapped . <p> The crowd parted and made way for Kara as she walked to me and took my arm . " Doctor Nelson has come at my request . He 's been good enough to offer his services . " <p> Reluctantly , the men backed off , probably out of respect for a teenager who had just lost her father . <p> " Well then , " Davis said , " we 'll call if we need you . Let 's move out . Ray , get the dogs . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a good twenty minutes for the party to finally roar off in their squad cars and pickup trucks , leaving Kara and me on the front lawn . <p> " Thank you for coming , " she said . <p> " No need to thank me . " <p> " Let 's go now . I have backpacks ready . " <p> " Where exactly are we going ? " I asked . <p> " Up there , " she said and pointed to ' the mountain behind the manor house . A brown scar of leveled forest , sutured by telephone lines , disfigured the fir-covered face of the mountain . For a moment , a helicopter circled the peak like a bird of prey , then vanished over the mountain . <p> " You know , " I said , " wandering around up there when trigger happy National Guardsmen and local folks are out hunting is n't the safest thing I can think of . I would n't want one of them mistaking me for a squirrel . " <p> Kara hoisted her pack to her shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " We wo n't wander much . I know where we 're going . " <p> " Which is ? " <p> " An old fire tower . " <p> " What makes you think they 'll be there ? They could be in a different county by now . " <p> " It 's the best I can do , " she said and marched off . <p> I slipped my pack 's straps over my shoulders and followed . I had hoped there would be a path , but instead we climbed directly through the trees . Before long , my middle-aged knees and thighs ached from the uphill climb and the effort of scrambling over brambles and undergrowth . My feet slipped on the wet carpet of pine needles . Once as I slipped , I reached out to break my fall by grabbing a trunk ; rough bark raked my hand , drew blood . The longer we climbed , the more I felt old and fat . <p> " Are you all right ? " Kara called back to me . <p> " Fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders burned beneath the pack . <p> Kara negotiated the mountainside like a mountain cat . I stifled my complaints and did my best to keep up with her , ashamed to admit I could n't keep up and needed a break . <p> In three hours , we covered perhaps only a mile and a half , our pace slowed by the steep grade . I was ready to quit when Kara said , " Over there . " <p> The turret shape of an old fire tower poked above the trees . " My hideaway , " Kara said . " I used to play there , to get away from my family . I pretended it was a castle . " <p> " What makes you think the pack will come here ? " <p> " Because I told them about it . Told them what this place meant to me . And I think they 'll know I 've come here . " <p> " How ? " <p> She shrugged her shoulders . " Do n't know . Maybe they 'll smell me . I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ridiculous assumption to me , but then the whole trek seemed like a waste of time . Still I followed her up the remaining one hundred yards and helped her off with her pack . Inside , we climbed the rickety stairs , sidestepping rotted boards and dodging spider webs , until we emerged into a circular room at the top . She led me onto the balcony . The mountains rolled around us like great waves ; below us the dark expanse of a river cut through a gorge ; mist clung to the heights , seemed ready to reach out and brush our skin with delicate fingers . In the far distance dark storm clouds bruised the horizon a deep purple . <p> How far had we traveled from the plush carpet of my office ? <p> These were ancient mountains ; slumbering for centuries ; moaning in their sleep . <p> " It 'll be dark soon , " I said . " We ca n't wait that long . " <p> " We may have to spend the night , " she said . <p> " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . <p> I looked out across the mountains . In the distance the hounds of the search party bayed . Men shouted . I shuddered . From the damp , I told myself . Nothing more . <p> With the night came the cold . Kara had brought the latest in thermal blankets : lightweight nylon webbed with filaments that captured our body heat . We sat inside the tower , wrapped in our blankets , feeling as if we were warming ourselves before a fire in a cave . A pocket torch propped on the floor cast half her face in bluish light , left the other half in shadow . <p> " So this was your playhouse , " I said . <p> " Yes , " she said . " Like I said , it was lonely . I went exploring often , found this place , sometimes spent whole days here . " <p> " Your parents did n't mind ? I mean it 's not exactly safe . " <p> She lit a cigarette . I almost gagged at the smell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they knew I was gone , " she said . " I was like a piece of the furniture . You do n't really think about furniture unless you need to sit down . " <p> Adolescent moping was as normal as flu season ; most of my students were afflicted by it , whining about the past , wearing their angst like a black cape . I was n't sure how much of Kara 's self-pity was only an effect of her age , and how much of it was justified . The one time I had met Rutger Hannover , he had been polite , brisk and business-like . And yet I had walked away with an intense dislike for the man . At the time I told myself it was probably simple sour grapes over his money . Seeing his daughter , I was n't sure . I have found that power does not corrupt . People who seek power are already corrupted . <p> " I was pregnant once , " she said . Her voice was neutral , as if she were reading aloud from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could think of as a response . <p> " I was in love with this boy in school . His family was n't as wealthy as mine , but close . He was always fighting his parents . Failing school . They were appalled . They threatened to send him to a military school . He said if they did he 'd learn the arts of war and come back and wipe them off the face of the Earth . He was so romantic . " <p> " If you say so . " <p> " So I got pregnant . My parents arranged an abortion . I refused . I told my boyfriend and begged him to take me away . To Europe or someplace . He thought about it , but when he realized his parents would cut him off from his money , he urged me to go along with the abortion . So I gave in . Later my father told me that while I was undergoing the operation , they had a limiter implanted in my ovaries . " <p> " I beg your pardon ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ version of a chastity belt . Nanotechnology . It kills sperm . The machinery perpetuates itself so it never runs out . It can only be disarmed by a chemical code . My parents held onto the code like it was the key to the chastity belt . They could decide when and with whom I would get pregnant . " <p> " Jesus Christ , " I muttered . " What bastards . But that ca n't be legal ? " <p> The corner of her lips facing the light curled into a lightning bolt of a smile . " Legal ? What 's legal is defined by how much money you have . " <p> " I guess so , " I said . I had already tasted Rutger Hannover 's money . In a sense he had paid for the last seven years of my life . <p> After that we said little . Kara smoked and I listened to the sounds of the night . Soon I was dozing . <p> I awoke to find Kara 's arm on mine , her face close to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I think it 's them . " <p> We slipped onto the balcony . The sky was ablaze with stars . The moon plated the mountains in silver . Below , shadows crept from the dark mass of the trees , six of them , sniffing the ground , tails down , ears alert . One face turned upward and stared at us . <p> " I 'm going down , " she said . <p> " Kara , wait .... " <p> But she was gone . I raced after her , caught up with her just as she opened the door at the bottom of the stairs . <p> Moonlight reflected from six pairs of eyes . I could hear their breathing in the darkness , see steam rising . <p> Kara ran to them , knelt and hugged one shaggy head while the others crowded around her . <p> Then a head turned toward me , regarded me with shining eyes . " James , " it said , a deep inhuman sound like a growl tricked into forming words . <p> " Speaker , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , " Speaker said . <p> For a moment I felt dizzy , then forced myself into the moonlight . The great shepherd bodies surrounded me , sniffed my legs , nudged my hands . At last Speaker licked my palm . " We are glad , " he said . <p> They were all there , Speaker and Captain Eddie and Toto and Merlin and Bo and Sir Lancelot , as I had left them , as if the years had never gone by . My eyes misted over . I quickly rubbed them dry . <p> " We 've come to help you , " Kara said . " They 're hunting you - because of my father . " <p> " We know , " Speaker said . <p> I knelt down and Captain Eddie , the largest , muscled the others away to take his old spot in front of me , leaning his bulk against my side . In terms of the pack , Captain Eddie assumed dominance , but from a human point of view it was obvious that Speaker was the alpha male . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tried to move in , was pushed away by Eddie , who soon had Merlin on his back , throat exposed . Captain Eddie then resumed his place of honor by my side . Speaker ignored them and curled up next to Kara , the real spot of power . <p> " Speaker , " I said , " I 've missed you . " <p> " Yes , James , " he said . Whether he understood the concept or not , I could n't tell . <p> " Where have you been hiding ? " <p> " Trees . Mountains . No man smell on the wind . " <p> " What do you eat ? " <p> " We hunt . " <p> " Speaker , do you know why the men are hunting you ? " <p> " Because of the father of Kara . " <p> " That was bad . " <p> Speaker laid his shaggy head on Kara 's leg . She stroked his back while he stretched . " Why did you kill him ? " Kara asked . <p> He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around us , wolf shapes in pale moonlight . At last Speaker said , " We protect Kara . " <p> " Why did Kara need protecting ? " I said . <p> " The hurt smell . " <p> " What hurt smell ? " <p> " Kara 's father . The hurt smell . He hurts . " <p> Kara turned her head toward me and although I could n't make out her features in the dark , I guessed she needed an answer . <p> " Speaker , did you smell the hurt smell before ? " <p> " He hurts the sun girl . He hurts others . " <p> I asked Kara if she knew who the sun girl was ; she shook her head . She said , " Speaker , tell me about the sun girl . " <p> " We sleep . He comes to the kennel . The sun girl is there . He punishes her . He holds her down . We smell the human blood . " <p> Kara was silent ; I followed suit , unwilling to disturb whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Who was the sun girl ? " Kara asked . <p> " The one with your face and sun hair . " <p> Kara groaned , then stifled her voice into a monotone , the voice that masked the ache inside . " My cousin . She stayed with us one summer for a week . Something happened , I never knew what . They took her away . There were rumors about an institution . Oh god . " <p> " Speaker , " I said . " You saw Kara 's father hurt the sun girl ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " You said there were others he hurt . " <p> " Yes . " <p> " In the kennel ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " And you thought he was going to hurt Kara ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " Why ? " <p> " The hurt smell . " <p> Kara said , " What does that mean ? " <p> I shrugged my shoulders . " You said your father had been drinking that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I left the rest unsaid , but placed a reassuring hand on her shoulder . She felt fragile beneath my palm . " I 'm sorry . " <p> " I 'm not , " she said , trying to sound tough , but the words sounded strangled . " Then they were protecting me . The police will understand that . They 'll leave them alone . " <p> " It may not be that easy , " I said . " There 's no direct evidence that your father intended to hurt you . Whatever he did in the past has obviously been hushed up . Even if we could get your cousin to talk , it still is n't a reason for what they did . " <p> Kara laughed , but there was a hole in the sound where the humor should have been . " ' No reason ? " <p> " From our point of view . " <p> " But they 're dogs . " <p> " Dogs that can abstract . Whether the hurt smell is alcohol or something else , they knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , going to hurt . The abstracting part of their brains took this sense and postulated that he was going to hurt again and that it might be you . Apparently the other victims were girls or women . They made a decision to stop him . " <p> " Maybe they were right . " <p> " Maybe they misunderstood . Do n't sentimentalize them , Kara . They 're animals . You know what the first thing a male lion does if he takes over a pride ? He eats the children . And he probably does n't feel much remorse over it . We ca n't really understand them yet and they may not understand us . They may have misinterpreted whatever they sensed from your father . " <p> " I know in my heart they were right . " <p> " Even if they were , it wo n't make much of a difference to that posse we just met . The dogs killed a human being . People will want revenge . " <p> " Then what can we do ? " <p> I watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , primeval dread as if I were a Neanderthal frightened by the shapes prowling beyond the cave . They had taken it upon themselves to kill ; there was no reason to assume they might not do it again . Perhaps they should be killed . I shivered in the cold mountain wind . <p> We spent the night with the pack , both of us chilled by the mountain winds despite our thermal blankets , but reluctant to move into the fire tower ; the dogs balked at entering and Kara and I wanted to spend every minute we had with them . When the sky turned pale gray above the rounded peaks , the pack became restless , wary of the day and the hunters . <p> Kara knelt between Bo and Merlin . I took the opportunity to draw Speaker away from the others . <p> " Speaker , tell me about Kara 's father . " <p> " What do you wish to know ? " he said in his deep growl-like voice . <p> " Was he kind to you ? " <p> " He brings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food into the kennels . They make the laughing sound . " <p> " Did he ever hurt you ? " <p> " No , " Speaker said . <p> Speaker lay on his stomach and licked at a spot on his forepaw where he had obsessively licked the skin into an open wound . Lick spots were common among certain breeds . Veterinarians ascribed the behavior to boredom . That , of course , was in normal dogs . What it meant in Speaker was hard to judge . <p> " Speaker , did you hate Kara 's father ? " <p> He went on licking , silent , as if pondering the question . " We do not know hate , " Speaker said . <p> " Do you know what the word means ? " <p> " You tell me about these things . Hate is  --  intense hostility and aversion . " <p> His answer surprised me ; it was a dictionary definition , taught to him years ago . <p> " But what does that meant " <p> Speaker ceased licking and stared forlornly at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or for worse he was my creation ; I had to know what manner of being I had created . <p> " Speaker , what did you feel when you killed Kara 's father ? " <p> " We feel our hearts beating . Wind roars . Smell of machine blood . We taste man blood . All around the flashing light in the sky . " <p> " Lightning ? " <p> " Yes . We are lightning in our blood . " <p> " Were you angry ? " <p> " We can not say . " <p> " Why not ? " <p> " Angry is human . " <p> " How do you feel when Kara pets you ? " <p> " Warm . Lying on blankets . Full stomachs . No hurt . We sleep . Hurt does not come . We are we . " <p> I resisted the temptation to ask how he felt when I was near . Instead , I asked , " What would you do if I tried to hurt you ? " <p> He began to lick again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you feel ? " <p> " Lost in the woods . No more we . Bodies fall apart . Flashing lights in the sky . " <p> " Would you kill me ? " <p> " We would be  --  no more . " <p> " What does that mean ? " <p> He looked up at me ; in the now gray light of dawn he looked helpless to explain . <p> " Does that mean if you hurt me , someone would kill you ? " <p> " No , " Speaker said . " We are no more . " <p> " Tell me about the we . " <p> " We run . Captain Eddie runs treeside . Merlin runs not Captain Eddie . Speaker runs not Merlin . Toto runs not Sir Lancelot .

We are the water things . We are smell of dead fish . We are smell of seaweed . We are the warming warming sun . We are the kill birds in the high high nests . We are the smell of their eggs . Captain Eddie runs not Speaker . Merlin runs not Captain Eddie . Toto runs not Sir Lancelot . We are golden light through the trees . We are water and the crashing sound . High high high rocks . The not-we runs . Captain Eddie runs toward the sun . The not-we turns from him . Water crashing . Hot hot hot sun . We taste the blood of the not we . We are warm sun to our bones . We are smell of fur . We are smell of bodies . We are taste of wet fur . We sleep . " <p> If a physicist told me that gravity is a bend in space caused by mass , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could never understand in a really substantial way , never make that concept part of my being , because I do not live in a universe where I actually experience space bending . Space is the absence of anything to bend . Was Speaker in the same situation , trying to understand concepts that had no reality in his world ? <p> Or was I the one trying to understand his concepts that had no reality in my world ? <p> " Speaker , what will you do now ? " <p> " We hunt . " <p> I expected more ; he only continued licking . <p> I reached down , scratched him behind his ear . <p> We joined the others . The sky above the mountains was amber , the color of caution . The day was beginning . Soon the helicopters would return ; the haying of hounds would fill the mountains . <p> Speaker leaned against my side , sniffed my hand . <p> " Speaker , " I said . " At night . Return here . " <p> " Yes , James , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the long shadows beneath the trees as quietly as mist dissolved into the morning air . <p> Kara looked up at me ; dirty streaks stained her cheeks . " There is evil in the world , " she said . " I never believed that before . " <p> I shrugged my shoulders . " In our world . I 'm not sure the concept makes sense in their world . " <p> " My father . Why  --  would he .... ? " <p> " Because it was easy , I guess . I ca n't pretend to know . " <p> Again she wiped her eyes . " You 'll convince them , wo n't you ? You can make them see  --  leave the dogs alone . " <p> Would I ? <p> No matter what the reason , no matter the justification , they had killed a man . I could not share Kara 's faith ; if the hunters found them , no matter what I said , they would be killed . If they eluded the searchers , which I had no doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not kill again ? <p> I told myself old Rutger Hannover deserved to die . <p> It made no difference . They might kill again . I could not have more blood on my hands . <p> I looked out at the mountains , the sunward sides of the pines ablaze with light , the other sides deep in shadow . Far below us an engine raced . Dogs barked . <p> " I once read an animal behaviorist who talked about ritual behavior in animals , " I said . " He made a point that at the time I could n't understand . He said that an animal 's ritualized behavior , mating or fighting for instance , was in itself the animal 's feeling about the act . Love is the act of the mating ritual . I think I glimpse now what he meant . Speaker does not feel hatred . He does not feel murderous rage . He feels the act of doing something , of licking your hand or ripping your throat . Feeling , act and motivation are one and the same . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can plan . He can understand our words . In a human it would be as if our unconscious drives and our rational intellect were one and the same . I do n't think we can even pretend to imagine his experience of the world . " A new idea occurred to me . " The human brain evolved too fast . Usually evolution occurs through a slow change in physical structure . The fin becomes a hand . But the human brain evolved so fast that there was no time for the structures to change , so new structures were simply overlaid on top of the old , the mammalian warmth on top of the cold reptilian instinct for survival , the human reason on top of both . So we are all three at once  --  split , divided creatures . Speaker , on the other hand , because we were able to change his genetic structure , is not split . His mammalian brain and his new human thinking powers are united . He might be what we should have been . " <p> " You 'll tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course , " I said . Poor Kara . She was n't old enough to understand that everything I could tell them would only provide another justification to end the pack 's existence . Not many humans would be able to tolerate the realization that dogs had just leaped ahead of them on the evolutionary scale . <p> The downward trek was much easier , yet by the time we reached the manor house , the sun was directly above us and we were both tired and sweating . The grounds were deserted , the posse off on its chase . We helped ourselves to old Rutger Hannover 's food , then Kara fell asleep in a wicker chair on the sun porch . Soon , I too dozed in the cool of the paneled living room . <p> Late in the afternoon , I awoke to the sound of voices on the lawn . I let Kara sleep , wandered into the sunlight to find Captain Davis and his men . He studied me as I approached , his dull expression like a barn owl waiting for a mouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So I suppose you found ' em , aye ? " <p> " As a matter of fact , yes . " <p> They stared at me as if I were a lunatic . <p> " We talked to them . They were protecting Kara . It seems as if they witnessed Hannover molesting some of his relatives . So they stopped him before he could hurt anyone else . " <p> " You 're shitting me , " Davis said . <p> Another man laughed . <p> " You do n't have to take my word for it . Talk to Kara 's cousin . Now that Hannover is dead , she 'll probably confirm it . " <p> Captain Davis studied me , chewing his lip , frowning . At last he said , " That 's crap . But even if it 's true , it wo n't make any difference . They still got to be brought down . " <p> " I know , " I said . I had known it all along and despite the feeling like some vital organ shredding inside my gut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were dangerous . " There 's an old fire tower three quarters of the way up that mountain . They 'll come there tonight . " <p> " How do you know that ? " <p> " I told them to be there . In some ways they still think I 'm their master . " <p> From the contempt on their faces , I knew they were now convinced I was crazy . Still , Davis was smart enough to know their search had been fruitless and he had no more cards to play . <p> " If this is a wild goose chase I 'll personally jail your ass . " <p> No doubt with pleasure . <p> I watched them hurry for the tree line , disappear into the pines , swept up again in the hunt . <p> The pain was gone ; I was numb , too depressed to feel much of anything . My first inclination was to run , before I had to face Kara , before I heard the guns firing in the mountains , but instead I went into the house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , intending to rest a moment before leaving . Soon I slept and dreamed of shapes racing through moonlit trees . <p> I awoke to find real moonlight casting silver pools across the hardwood floors . The sun room across the hall was ablaze in the moonlight . The wicker chair was empty . <p> " Kara ! " I called . <p> The house was quiet . <p> I struggled from the chair and at the bottom of the broad staircase I called her again . I heard nothing . <p> Floorboards creaked at the far end of the hall . I traced the sound to the ballroom , hesitated with my hand on the door knob . I could lie to her , knew I would n't . How could I make her understand it was for the best ? <p> I opened the door . Moonlight shining through Venetian blinds cut knife wounds through the darkness . Shapes prowled the shadows . One massive shape perched on the grand piano and watched me . Another padded across the dance floor , a third circled the bar , stalked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> On the couch Kara sat with Speaker at her feet . <p> There was silence except for the myriad concussions of their breathing . A low growl rumbled across the room . <p> " They knew , " Kara said . <p> " What ? " My voice sounded odd in my ears , as if someone else had spoken . <p> " They knew it was a trap . " <p> " I had to , " I said , sounding lame . " I had no choice . " <p> " I guess it does n't matter , " she said . " They 're safe . They 'll go now . No one will find them except maybe me . They 'll live free . " <p> I stepped forward . To my right , Captain Eddie growled . I froze . <p> " Speaker , I 'm sorry . I never meant you any harm . " <p> Kara laughed . " Really ? Can you guess how they knew it was a trap ? They figured it out , of course , but do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " What ? " <p> " Whatever it was they smelled on my father , they smelled on you too . It was n't alcohol . It was something much more  --  terrible . The smell of your blood , of your corruption . You 're the scientist , you figure it out . " <p> " That 's crazy ! " <p> " Is it ? Did you even try to help them ? " <p> I could say nothing . <p> " No , you just turned them in , did n't you ? Maybe you just did n't want them around to spoil your precious job and your precious reputation . Or maybe you just did n't want them around because they reminded you of what you did to them , what you were responsible for when my father died . " <p> " They killed . I had no choice . " <p> " You had a choice . " <p> " Speaker ? " <p> His low growl drifted through the darkness . " Yes , James . " <p> " What was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Hurt smell . " <p> " Like Kara 's father ? " <p> " Yes , James . The hurt smell draws the men there . We go there never . " <p> I tried to protest , but the words refused to come ; on the edge of my mind a thought formed , wordless and yet vivid like the scent of a storm brought on the wind . I knew Kara was right . Somehow they knew me right down to the scents of the chemical reactions in my cells . All of my noble rationalizations crumbled like sand . <p> Kara petted Speaker 's head . " Go now . Be safe . " <p> Speaker nuzzled her hand , then turned toward me . " Good-bye , James . " <p> " I 'm sorry , " I said . <p> " James runs with the pack , " he said . " Kara runs with the pack . We are we . " <p> Then they were gone , through the patio door , as swift and quiet as shadows . I followed them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were lost in the darkness of the trees . Perhaps that local had been right ; perhaps they would breed . <p> Now , years later , I feel as if they are with me , at odd moments , driving alone at night , or sometimes when I lecture . From time to time I receive anonymous letters , newspaper clippings usually about strange events on the east coast : a farmer 's chicken coup raided , strange shapes seen in the woods at night , hunters ' camps mysteriously destroyed , local dogs disappearing . <p> Now , I teach not so much about cells , but of the communal creatures they form , less about the grammar of DNA and more about how DNA creates the grand syntax of love and need and betrayal and loyalty . <p> Most of all I teach that we are no longer alone . <p> <p> <p> By Michael Thomas <p> Michael Thomas is new to fiction writing . " Nightwatch " is his first published short story , although he has two others in our inventory . He is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a non-fiction writer and editor of Detroit Medical News , a weekly news magazine for physicians . He lives in Michigan with his wife and daughter <p> He writes that this story was inspired by his golden retriever . " Often I would take the dogfor a run when I woke up in the morning . Just as often I was too lazy to take him out . On the mornings when I intended to take him out , he bounded up to me ready to go even before I made it out of bed . On the mornings when I was n't taking him , he did n't even bother to wake up . As far as I could tell there was no difference in the way I acted , or in the time of day , things that would have been a clue to a human being about my intentions . The dog , however , had his own clues although I have no idea what they were . Somehow , the result was ' Nightwatch . ' " <p>         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
