<p> At the First AME Church in south central , the word " King " was as prevalent as the hundreds of bright Easter bonnets . <p> A lively opening hymn , King of the World , came first . In the balcony , sun shone through a 10-foot-high stained glass image of Martin Luther King Jr . And the Rev. Cecil Murray 's impassioned sermon was built around the Rodney King civil rights case , now in the hands of the jury . <p> " The cross was not the beginning of the end , it was the end of the beginning , " Murray told the congregation of 3,000 . " I want you to carry a cross out of here today and I want you to help keep this city cool . " <p> While Easter dawned glorious , life in this melting pot city clearly carried an edge , which could be honed each day the jury deliberates in the federal trial of four police officers accused of violating King 's civil rights . <p> But Sunday , from the First African Methodist Episopal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Koreatown to All Saints Episcopal Church in Beverly Hills , ministers asked their followers to hope rather than despair . <p> Easter , with its message of faith and rebirth , became a tortured metaphor across the city . <p> It began in court a day before . Defense lawyer Harland Braun closed the trial of the four police officers by comparing their situation to the trial of Jesus Christ . <p> He asked jurors not to play the role of Pontius Pilate , the official who condemned Christ . " Pilate asked the question , ' What evil has this man done ? ' and the authorities had no answer , " Braun said . <p> " But Matthew tells us the prisoner was condemned because there was a fear of riots in the streets , " Braun said . <p> In church , the legal battle was not couched in such fear . <p> " We can not afford to lose our city , we can not afford to lose a life , we can not afford to burn down the very things that belong to us , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozens of reporters and photographers . <p> The church , the site of a jam-packed " healing " service the Sunday following the riots , drew worshipers from as far away as Long Beach to this grassy knoll in a residential area off Western Avenue . <p> Even before the sermon , mayoral candidate Nate Holden spoke from the pulpit : " The eyes of the world are upon us because of the King trial . We all know we saw what we saw ( on the King videotape ) . Now let 's begin to heal it . " <p> Playwright Wendy Suffert , 23 , who moved here from Dallas two years ago , watched her neighborhood burn from the roof of her apartment complex . <p> The experience led her to write The Declining Significance of Race : Do n't question your color , baby , which premieres Friday in Santa Monica . <p> The play pits two cousins who find common ground , one from south central and the other from Hollywood Hills . <p> " It 's about what you can give , " Suffert says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Robin Winbush , 40 , of Inglewood , left the services with mixed emotions . He came to church to pray for calm . But as a black man , he understands the anger many feel . <p> He talked about a recent accident , in which he struck but did not seriously injure a pedestrian at the Beverly Center shopping mall . Immediately , police descended on him . <p> " I can sympathize with what it 's like to be at the point of a police officer 's gun , because I 've been there , " he says . " I was made to lie down on the ground , I was cursed . " <p> He was charged with assault with a deadly weapon . <p> Still , Winbush , a maintenance worker for Los Angeles County , says he , his wife Mary Louise , son Christopher , 13 , and daughter Susanne , 11 , hope to control their anger . <p> In church , he prayed " that there will be peace after the verdicts . I hope to God what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A few miles to the north , on Olympic Boulevard , minister Heewang Byun of New Hope Baptist Church in Koreatown stood before his storefront church marked with graffiti and professed not to be worried much at all . <p> " This time , " he says , " it will be different . " <p> Paul Chung , passing out church fliers on the sidewalk , found his dental supply store ransacked in the riots last year . <p> The holiday became not a time for feasting and Easter bonnets , but a rare moment to pause , take a deep breath and pray his pastor is right . <p> " We are waiting for judgment , " he says . <p> The King case was not mentioned during the Holy Eucharist at the white-steepled All Saints Church in Beverly Hills . <p> The only reference was an oblique plea in prayers of the people . " For the officials of the city of Los Angeles , that they may promote justice and peace for all people . . . we pray to you , " the deacon sang . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a planter teeming with impatiens , Scott Ratchick , 32 , a lawyer , watched his son , Adam , 2 , chase across the manicured lawn in his knee-high Easter suit , anxious to get home and hunt eggs . <p> He tried to explain the effect of the King trial . <p> A year ago , he opened the windows and smoke from nearby fires burned his nostrils . Now , he 's not sure what will come . <p> " It 's just a lot of anticipation - but not really knowing what to anticipate , " he says . " The easiest way to describe it is that we 've made evacuation plans . " <p> Ratchick recognizes that in many regards , his life is separated by an invisible barrier , a psychological wall of sorts , running the length of Wilshire Boulevard . He hesitates to call it an us vs. them mentality , but it 's clear the riots encroached on his world last year . <p> " I opened the windows and I could smell the fumes from the smoke , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the area , coming home from a Lakers game , I think . It looked like Beirut . " <p> And though he works downtown , he 's never really visited the broad swath of south central that cuts through the mid-section of the city . <p> Worshiper Melanie Eichel , 37 , a technical writer with an interest in architecture , visited the Watts towers - a local landmark - with a church conservancy group over the weekend . <p> She was surprised at the small houses with well-kept yards . They reminded her of her grandfather 's first home in nearby Boyle Heights . <p> " And the people getting on and off at the blue line , they were normal , everyday people , " she says . <p> " It does n't loom like a cloud over my head , now , " she says of the trial . " This is my city and I feel comfortable here . " <p> About the only church-goers who did n't hear a message related to the King case were five sequestered jurors who attended services with U.S. marshals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says U.S. District Judge John Davies , " that the ministers speaking in these churches should not make any comments regarding this case . " <p> The ministers agreed not to mention the community impact of verdicts or any other matters connected to the trial . Contributing : Gary Fields and Carol J. Castaneda
