SITTING ON A BALE OF BARLEY destined for his cattle , Dick Carver gets just a little misty eyed as he recalls the moment that propelled him to leadership of a rebellion now sweeping the West . Usually mild mannered and affable , the Nevada rancher and Nye County commissioner reached a point last year when he had had enough . To him , federal intrusion into the daily life of his county had simply grown too great , so on July 4 , 1994  --  Independence Day  --  he took the law into his own hands . His weapon of choice : a rusting , yellow D-7 Caterpillar bulldozer . <P> Carver sat astride the 22-ton machine , his dust-caked face streaked with the paths of recent tears . He remembers being frightened and tense as he guided the Cat toward an armed U.S. Forest Service agent holding a hand-lettered sign ordering Carver to stop . The agent stumbled and wound up briefly crawling on hands and knees . But Carver kept coming . He pulled out a pocket-size copy of the U.S. Constitution , which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the agent as a crowd of about 200 people , a quarter of them armed , cheered him forward . " I was damn scared , " says Carver . He was afraid someone  --  maybe the agent , maybe an overzealous spectator  --  would draw a gun and trigger a cascade of violence . " I told myself , ' Dick , you 've got to keep going . Because if you stop , the people are going to do something , and someone 's going to get hurt . ' " <P> Carver had climbed aboard the Caterpillar to bulldoze open a weather-damaged road across a national forest . The hitch was , he wanted to do so without federal permission . Although plainly illegal , in Carver 's mind it was an act of civil disobedience  --  a frontier Boston Tea Party  --  warranted by the tyranny he and his fellow citizens in Nye had long endured . But in this case , the purported tyrant was the U.S. government . <P> The incident immediately made Carver a leading voice in the so-called county-supremacy movement now gaining momentum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawsuit seeking to assert once and for all the government 's ownership of federal lands in Nye County and , by legal inference , its possession of public lands that cover one-third of the nation 's ground . The Justice Department estimates that at least 35 counties , primarily in Arizona , New Mexico , Nevada and California , have declared authority over federal lands within their boundaries . Other estimates put the number far higher . The National Federal Lands Conference , a Utah organization devoted to fostering resistance , believes more than 300 counties have claimed some degree of sovereignty over federal lands , and many more have considered the idea , including counties in states as far east as Maine and Florida .
