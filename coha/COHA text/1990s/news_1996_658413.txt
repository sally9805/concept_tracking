<p> The first thing to know about a river cruise is that when the captain says the boat will leave at 11 a.m. , he may mean 10:55 . <p> My husband and I had scrambled up a hill to get a better view of the Danube River and the castle ruins above the Austrian town of Durnstein . The rain had stopped , and clouds settled in long fingers around the hills at the bend of the river . <p> Twenty minutes up to the ruins , 20 back , the local guide had said . We figured we could shave five or 10 minutes , but had n't counted on the splendor of the view or the camera 's running out of batteries and film at the same time . No problem , just pick up the pace in the flats . We 'd still be back with five minutes to spare . <p> But at 10:55 , the crew had pulled up the gangplank and were casting off from shore . The sailors manning the ramp spoke mainly Hungarian , but recognized genuine alarm when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us aboard . <p> ( You 're supposed to sign out when you leave the boat , so that the crew knows when everyone is back . That instruction had escaped us . It would not again . ) <p> We were new to cruises , even to the idea of taking cruises . Somehow the thought of adhering to a schedule violated an unwritten law of vacations . But the Danube is one of the most beautiful rivers in the world . The structures along its banks span thousands of years of history and culture . It had to be seen from a boat . <p> Our six days on the Danube began in Budapest . We flew from Strasbourg , France , to Hungary 's capital , then churned up the Danube through Central Europe : Hungary , Slovakia , Austria , and Germany . <p> Our French cruise ship , Sissi , was named for a Habsburg princess renowned for her beauty and elegant attire . Happily , our fellow passengers did not dress up to the standards of Elisabeth von sterreich . We had packed in haste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in our duffel bags were better suited to a hike in the woods than a candlelight dinner at the captain 's table . <p> Most of the passengers on our cruise lived near Strasbourg , the home base of the cruise line . They spoke French , German , or Alsatian , a regional dialect . Many could manage a conversation in English , but also welcomed the chance to improve any effort to speak their language . <p> They also clearly enjoyed this cruise : the food , the crew , the bingo games , the morning exercise class , going through the locks , visiting Baroque churches , or just talking to strangers on deck . <p> THIS cruise included two-day stops in Budapest and Vienna , as well as shorter visits to Castle Hill in the Hungarian town of Esztergom , Durnstein , and the Baroque abbey at Melk , in Austria . Guided tours were available in French or German , but the crew said that English-speaking guides could be arranged in advance . <p> The advantage of such tours is that you can cover lots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urge to shout " Stop ! " <p> In Budapest , the tours hit high points of Hungarian national pride : the castle district , Heroes ' Square , the Parliament ( 691 rooms , 365 spires ) , and folk dance at the Rajko music school . But we sped past the largest synagogue in Europe , " recently restored with help from American film actors , especially Tony Curtis , " the guide said . <p> We also skipped sites connected with the 160-year Turkish occupation of Budapest , as well as the monumental Communist-era statues , all moved to the Park of Nostalgia at the edge of the city . <p> By Vienna , we had begun scripting our own tours . In the time it took the cruise tour to visit the Vienna woods , eat dinner on board , and play the first two rounds of bingo , we had caught a first glimpse of the Ringstrasse , seen Wagner 's " Siegfried " at the Vienna opera house , and eaten bowls of goulash and a plateful of warm pgacsa ( pastry ) . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of travel is to drive into a town , sit down in the cafe in the main square , listen to what people were talking about , and , on that basis , decide whether it was worth staying there . <p> Without the language skills of a Central European , this strategy is not feasible . But there is much to be learned from just walking through neighborhoods . <p> For example : Notice the animals on the streets . Paris is a city of liter-sized , " designer " dogs ; Rome , a city of cats . Budapest is a city of power dogs - Doberman pinschers , German shepherds , and ( illegal ) pit bulls . The tough dogs are a new development , since the end of Communist rule , a local guide told us . They cost more than the equivalent of a month 's salary for the average Hungarian . <p> The cities and towns visited on this cruise are stunning - even after you 've seen enough chubby gold cherubs to last a lifetime . Budapest is two cities : Buda , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Pest , in the flats . Buda 's castle district is in the last stages of intensive sandblasting , painting , and reconstruction in honor of the nation 's 1,100th anniversary this year . Here you can still see shell and bullet marks from the 1956 Soviet invasion . <p> Many of the older mansions above the chalk cliffs fell into semi-ruin during the Communist era , and are now being bought up and restored by the " nouveau riche , " our local guide explains , with an edge of contempt in her voice for her nation 's controversial new capitalists . <p> Pest , the city on the left bank of the Danube , is more commercial and faster-paced . Some 600 coffee houses stood here at the turn of the century , when Budapest was the intellectual hub of Central Europe . Only a handful remain . At one of the last of the great coffee houses , the Gerbeaud , on Vorosmarty Square , we 'd hoped to find echoes of the intense political debates of the past but found mainly tourists . <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to be a local mineral spring that we stumbled upon before breakfast one morning . For 7 forints a liter ( pennies ) , you can fill plastic containers with warm , sulfur-smelling water , prized since Celtic times . People waited in lines , and many hauled the water home by hand . <p> Outside , the morning commute had begun , and diesel buses packed with workers turned the air heavy . But only a short walk up Buda hill , the air changed - a phenomenon apparently appreciated as much by the city 's former nobles as by its nouveau riche today . <p> Rivers have a way of imposing their own rhythms . Just the fact of being out of range of a telephone changes the pace of a day . It 's good to fall asleep listening to the sounds of a river , often just the quick slap of wavelets below the cabin window . Along quiet stretches , even over the drone of the ship 's engine , you could hear frogs on the banks or cuckoos in the woods . <p> We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and many sodden , misty mornings on our early spring voyage . Baroque churches and castles do well in mist . One evening , two swans flew by at eye level , past a castle and into the sunset . <p> But there 's more to this river than romance . The Danube has been the backbone of Central Europe for centuries , its importance eclipsed by railroads less than 150 years ago . It 's called the Donau in Germany and Austria , the Dunaj in Slovakia , and the Duna in Hungary . After the Volga in Russia , it is the second-longest river in Europe . <p> Flood markings high on the walls of old houses along the river are a reminder that this waterway , by whatever name , has been capable of much destruction . <p> The river also quietly testifies to wartime ravages . " There 's about 80 percent less traffic on this river since the war in Yugoslavia , " says our captain , Robert Weinberger . " What you see on the Rhine in an hour , you now see on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran from Passau , Germany , to the river 's mouth in the Black Sea . Barges laden with coal , iron ore , stone , and wheat from Hungary , Yugoslavia , Romania , and Bulgaria used to ply these waters . But the Danube flows past war-torn cities like Vukovar in Croatia . <p> " Sometimes they 'd shoot at ships from the shore , " says Kalapos Gyula , a Hungarian sailor aboard our ship . A Russian ship was hit by a rocket , he said . " I 've met a few people from that ship ; I think they 've named a boat after the crew that were killed .
