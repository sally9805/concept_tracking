<p> A lean , light-skinned black man sits upright on a metal folding chair . Decked out in a pressed shirt , a cable-stitched sweater , and a bow tie , R. Khalil hardly fits the image of an inmate housed here at the high-security Maryland House of Corrections . <p> Mr. Khalil , whose rap sheet ranges from robbery to attempted murder , is aware of the contradictory picture he presents . He used to run with a tough crowd in Baltimore 's blighted inner city , where drug dealing and violence figured prominently in his past . A clean-shaven look and impeccable diction were foreign . <p> " Black men did n't have any images we could draw from , " Khalil says . <p> But while serving time for his first conviction , he learned about the Nation of Islam and its leader , Minister Louis Farrakhan . <p> " I joined the Nation of Islam during my first time in prison , " Khalil says , leaning forward , his arms braced on his knees , his hands folded . " The time here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better ways of living life . " <p> " The Nation of Islam made me feel like a person of worth more than any time in my life , " Khalil adds . " Mr. Farrakhan was the closest representation of manhood . " <p> Like a growing number of the black men who are serving time , he is drawn to Farrakhan 's powerfully articulated message of black pride . <p> Setting out requirements for strict discipline and moral behavior , the Nation of Islam promises prisoners a path to a productive life on the outside as well as the security and sense of strength derived from belonging to a " nation . " <p> But its influence on everything from prisoner conduct to agitation for better treatment has raised concerns of prison guards and religious groups alike . While the message is often positive , many acknowledge , it also has the ability to foment trouble among an already volatile population . <p> Supporters , from some corrections officials to black community groups , credit the Nation with raising hope , elevating standards , and strengthening family life for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's teachings - more about politics than theology - threaten to radicalize prisoners . They blame him for militant indoctrination of black youth who feel abandoned by American society . Farrakhan 's is a racist , separatist movement , they say , whose message has particular appeal for a group that feels disenfranchised . <p> " We see the prisons are being used as a new form of slavery , " Farrakhan said last week in an interview with Monitor contributor Luix Overbea . Laying more blame on the " white establishment " than the criminally charged , the minister contended that " blacks are being trapped into going to prison through crack and cocaine . The government is planting it in the black community , and then it arrests these people and puts them in prison , and then it puts them in forced labor . " <p> The most recent Justice Department data show that some 2.7 percent of the adult population in the United States is under correctional supervision - a number triple that of 1980 . " Black males are eight times more likely to be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief of the department 's corrections statistics program . Indeed , one-third of black men in their 20s are in prison or on probation . <p> Religious groups have long devoted considerable effort to reaching these inmates . They have met with some success : Back in 1991 , Mr. Beck 's office estimated that one-third of all inmates had joined an officially authorized religious group . And according to spiritual leaders and prison administrators , that proportion is growing quickly . <p> Farrakhan , among other religious leaders , is keenly aware that spiritual renewal often plays a prominent part in the lives of those behind bars . In his thousands of speeches and numerous books , he preaches self-reliance : Blacks must pool their financial resources , produce their own food , create their own businesses and jobs , police and reform their own people . The ultimate , he writes in " A Torchlight for America , " would be a release of all black inmates as the foundation for a new African country . <p> Among inmates , his recruiting has not been easy . His **33;159;TOOLONG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard edge of criminals who regard " doing time " as a rite of passage . Khalil concedes this . He also underscores that a man 's jail-house devotion to Farrakhan 's teachings does not preclude his abandonment of them once he is released . <p> Khalil says his own return to prison is " a result of my deviation " from Farrakhan 's teachings . Landing a radio job at Morgan State University in Baltimore , where he broadcast the minister 's speeches , did not keep him from the street . Once again , he landed in trouble . <p> " The movement has grown tremendously since I was last in prison , " reflects Khalil , who seeks new members by mentoring inmates . His " course materials " - including the Koran , the Final Call ( Nation of Islam 's newspaper ) and tapes of Farrakhan 's teachings - are sent from the organization 's Chicago headquarters and other outlets . <p> One such outlet is the Pyramid Bookstore near Howard University in Washington , D.C. There , Farrakhan 's " A Torchlight for America , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is also unavailable at the tape shop downstairs , where 750 cassettes of his speeches line one wall and videos of Farrakhan are found . It 's out of stock at the neighboring black bookstore and at all other places around the city that usually carry it . The merchants say the demand has never been greater . <p> Cradling his own copy of the book while visiting the prison mosque , Khalil says that " no person in prison can become an official registered member of the Nation of Islam , " but he can prepare to do so by ritual and orientation : praying , eating sparsely , and attending study groups . <p> In the penal system , Farrakhan continually butts heads with bureaucrats , especially in state and local correctional facilities . When he meets resistance , he sues . <p> Justice Department records date the Nation 's presence in federal prisons back to 1984 . Since Farrakhan 's success in attracting hundreds of thousands of American black men for the Million Man March in Washington last October , " there has been a burst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Van Baalen , a chaplain for the religious services branch of the Federal Bureau of Prisons . Ms. Van Baalen has computed that their membership rolls in federal institutions soared by 40 percent in the past seven months . <p> The march " was a turning point for Farrakhan followers who have recently started to shape up their own agenda , " reports Taha Tawil , a Sunni Muslim Imam at the Mother Mosque of America in Cedar Rapids , Iowa , and Islamic adviser for the Iowa Department of Corrections . Even in his rural state , where the number of incarcerated blacks is far below that for New York , Maryland , Illinois , or California , states with a much larger black population , Farrakhan is a force . " Since January , " Imam Tawil says , " the Nation has been allowed to operate officially in the state 's eight institutions . " <p> Khalil and other prison residents read about the march in newspapers , listened to it on the radio , and watched it on television . The interest will leverage into greater pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lead to more inmates embracing Farrakhan , Khalil says . <p> Farrakhan 's impact is tough to quantify . His organization is guarded about statistics . Its apparent growth concerns most established professional proselytizers , Muslims and Christians alike . <p> The Virginia-based Prison Fellowship , a 20-year-old national organization founded by Watergate ex-convict Charles Colson , has documented the growth in American , and especially black American , converts to Islam . It estimates that with 5 million or more Muslims in the United States ( the Washington-based Council on American-Islamic Relations puts it at 6 million ) , Islam may soon be the country 's second-largest religion . Mr. Colson 's group counts 1 out of every 15 American blacks as Muslim by birth or conversion . <p> Many Christian black leaders see such growth as a crisis . The burgeoning number of blacks who have been incarcerated - in 1995 the nation 's overall prison population posted the biggest gains in history - is a restive audience for Farrakhan . " Through fiery preaching and inflammatory statements , Farrakhan 's Nation of Islam has grown to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " assert Adam Edgerly , associate minister at Christian Evangelical Fellowship in Atlanta , Ga. , and Carl Ellis , associate pastor of New City Fellowship in Chattanooga , Tenn . <p> Les Porter , a volunteer counselor for the Pennsylvania Prison Society , claims that it encourages belligerence . Among the inmates who are attracted to Islam , " you can almost assume that the more aggressive type is part of the Nation of Islam , " he says . <p> " Other Muslim sects are more self-restrained , " adds Mr. Porter , who ministers on weekends at the Bethany Baptist Church , a pillar of the black community in Philadelphia . <p> Porter is worried about what he calls " the encroachment of Islam " on what has been largely Christian territory : prison conversions . Many evangelical leaders have reported to the Prison Fellowship their run-ins with Nation of Islam followers who disrupt Christian Bible classes and prayer meetings to ask probing questions about the relevance of Christianity - " the white man 's religion " - to black Americans . <p> Yet Porter admires the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Islam can do to restore black prisoners ' dignity and purpose while serving time . Farrakhan and his prison emissaries promise a strong support network , with housing and job opportunities , once the inmate is released . <p> It is not just black Christians who feel embattled . Sunni , Shi'ite , and other Muslim faithful often spurn the Nation of Islam : They are put off by Farrakhan 's diatribes against whites , Arabs , and other non-blacks and his rejection of traditional observance of Islamic rituals . <p> " Dignity does not have to be based on race-bashing , " comments Humam Abdul Malik , a Sunni Muslim who corresponds with and visits prisoners at the biggest jails and penitentiaries in the Washington metropolitan area . " Farrakhan preaches that the European is the devil . Penal instnal thinking . The Nation of Islam 's teaching is distorted to the point that you 're going to be confused . " <p> " Leader Farrakhan straddles a fence , " Abdul Malik continues . " He plays down the rhetoric , and the next thing you know , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotions and frustrations . The Nation of Islam 's racism and separatism are not seeds of growth and development , but seeds of destruction . " <p> Comments from the law-enforcement community are mixed . Some call criticisms of Farrakhan hyperbolic . <p> Chaplain Van Baalen asserts that the Nation of Islam 's challenge to the system 's " thin blue line " of security personnel is more perceived than realized . They are " aggressive recruiters , " the chaplain concedes , but they are not permitted to overstep their bounds : two chapel and study meetings per week . " We do not allow them to perform the military drills they would like to do - they have n't gone to war . We exercise reasonable control over what they can and can not do , and that requires good correctional managers . " <p> Many experienced prison officials credit Nation of Islam inmates with instilling better values . " Their standards are very high , " says Jeff Carter , the coordinating chaplain at New York 's Attica prison . " They 're doing a fantastic job with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . " <p> The organization 's methods and message trouble others . <p> Prison administrators have experienced the Nation of Islam at its most litigious . When it was blocked in its attempt to organize in a state facility near Dover , Del. , the Nation of Islam went to court against the Delaware Correctional Center . The court instructed the prison to hire a Muslim spiritual leader , but he proved too conventional for Farrakhan 's followers . So the Nation of Islam filed a second suit . After the group won the right to have a Nation of Islam member hold services , the authorities found they provoked anger among inmates , and the warden canceled the program . Once again , the Nation of Islam sued . <p> Antonio Barboza , a lieutenant in Baltimore Jail 's Central Booking and a black pastor at the Priceless Son Worship Center in Baltimore , has been a longtime observer of Farrakhan 's followers . Before he took his current job , he worked as a guard at the Maryland Penitentiary . <p> Mr. Barboza contends that by pitting black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and endangers society-at-large by helping to produce a more strident person once released . <p> Farrakhan 's organizers first try to build a power base by calling on inmates to advocate better living conditions , greater visitation rights , and the like . Barboza is suspicious of Farrakhan 's call for strict discipline : While the regimentation may develop more self-respect , it also emboldens those who may not otherwise challenge authority . He calls it " the quiet before the storm , bringing peace in the short term with an explosion in the long term . " He adds that the advocacy soon gives way to agitation : " They have a militaristic feel , and an anger toward the system , toward America . " <p> Khalil dismisses all of this talk as a " deliberate action on the part of state officials to present " the Nation of Islam as nefarious . " Fear can cloud people 's judgments , " Khalil says . His leader 's success , he adds , can be measured in the relatively small number of Farrakhan devotees who are repeat offenders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zero-tolerance policy for criminality has earned it a reputation for being an effective reformer . <p> Khalil is one of an undetermined number of exceptions to the Nation of Islam 's claim that its followers stay out of trouble . In his second prison term , Khalil is again a loyal Farrakhan follower , even a spiritual leader at the Maryland House of Corrections in Jessup . <p> Khalil 's experience is typical , says Mr. Porter , who has spent years as a counselor in Pennsylvania corrections houses and after-release programs . " They embrace it for protection when they 're inside the system , but once they are released and hit the old neighborhood , they put all that religion and discipline aside . " <p> But Khalil contends that Farrakhan 's teachings have permanently filled a gap . Through with his reckless street days , he says , he can now " represent and delineate the struggles of black people through Minister Farrakhan 's perspective . " <p> Many Christians fault themselves for allowing that perception of a gap to grow . Porter charges that the black church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's strength . <p> " I am ashamed that the black church has gotten a little bit too comfortable focusing on the surroundings and the building , but not enough to reach out to those not within the circle . " He is frustrated too , he says , that black churches are not doing enough to meet ex-convicts ' needs , unlike the Nation of Islam , whose strong networks provides help for inmates once they leave the prison gates . <p> And , he adds , the Nation 's message of black separatism resonates with many young prisoners . " To many of the incarcerated young men who are bent on a hostile attitude , taking a stand as a nation is very appealing , " Porter says . <p> Farrakhan 's prison organizers " help out inmates who are in need , " Khalil says , from distributing the Koran , the Muslim holy book , to instructing how to file pro se briefs , or self-filed claims , to the court . All this , Khalil affirms , supports the Nation of Islam 's primary goal " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The black struggle seems to have a very different meaning to the Rev. Jesse Jackson , whose Rainbow Coalition crosses racial and religious barriers . " Our community is characterized by either extreme hostility or indifference , " he laments . Perhaps the most prominent living figure among American blacks , Mr. Jackson says the fight for equality and integration has been a slow and exasperating one . He says the response to Farrakhan 's call to the Million Man March was " about alienation , pain , and crying out for a solution . " <p> But he dismisses the idea that the Nation of Islam is so adept at tapping into the rage that Farrakhan is a force to reckon with . " Extremists with power are really dangerous , " Jackson says . " Farrakhan has an extreme point of view , but does not have the power to do anything about it . The power to affect public policy , that 's a power of real concern . The No. 1 growth industry in America is jail , and the ones who have the real power are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undermining the order that exists both inside prison and beyond , Farrakhan 's proposed withdrawal from society " does not threaten the status quo , " Mr. Jackson says . Farrakhan 's weakness , he says , is that he fails to use precious resources ( black engagement ) " to negotiate with society to open up . " Hardly a political threat , he says , the " real story about the Nation is its value on moral virtues . Most of Farrakhan 's speeches are about personal behavior . " <p> Back at the Maryland House of Corrections , Khalil is trying to develop useful job skills . He works five days a week as a graphic engineer in the prison 's computer center , earning $ 2.30 a day . He cautions that his attire of pleated pants and shined shoes should not leave the impression that prison is pleasant . <p> " One thing we do n't want to do is glorify , " he admonishes with a wry smile . " I got a six-digit number . "
