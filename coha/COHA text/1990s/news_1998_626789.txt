<p> Doctors ' skills still needed <p> Robert P. Peebler 's June 28 , Outlook , " Rx for Medicine " was read with anticipation . Since Peebler is a professional and a recent survivor of a family medical crisis , I hoped he could lend inspiration to my thoughts about the status of my profession . <p> His article was a disappointment , however , offering no more than a simple hologram for improvement . <p> His point was well taken , that the complicated care needed by a patient is often lost in the terse scribbling of a paper chart . Similarly , care by hoards of specialists visiting the patient randomly and leaving finite but often disjointed notes was similarly correct . But Peebler left out several other important factors . <p> Medical care is shifting to care by primary-care physicians , family physicians and internists who are better trained to serve , not only as a link between the patient and family and multiple specialists , but as givers of care and repositories of the many nuances of a patient 's complicated history . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's good physicians still actively care for their patients in offices and hospitals . They share a common bond with their predecessors , the family doctors who made house calls : They care about the patient . <p> " The secret in caring for the patient is in caring for the patient , " was once said and still rings true . Scientific discussions and medical problem-solving go on at the bedside , on rounds and through interaction between colleagues . <p> It is unfortunate when this is not accurately portrayed in the clinical notes in a patient 's chart , but the process still goes on and still works . Today 's patients are also active in the process , suggesting both diagnoses and treatments . <p> Make no mistake , medicine has its failures as well as its successes . Failures are often a result not just of human error but of the limitations of medical science . There is still much to learn . But the primary factors are still the physician 's listening skills and ability to examine the patient , and caring about the human being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rothschild , Houston <p> <p> Let one group do all city 's audits <p> I 'm grateful to Mayor Lee Brown for clarifying the auditing responsibilities of the mayor and the city controller under the city charter , at least as he interprets it ( Outlook , July 5 , " Must keep politics out of city auditing process " ) . <p> However , any agency responsible for financial audits and contract compliance should , logically , also be responsible for performance audits since all auditing interrelates and overlaps to some degree . The agency conducting all three audits should provide a more comprehensive appraisal to the mayor , City Council and to the public . <p> Nothing in the General Accounting Office Auditing Standards , as quoted by Mayor Brown , indicates that all three auditing functions ca n't be done by the same agency . Further , nothing suggests that an " objective and independent " assessment by the city controller would be any more or less politicized than audits by the mayor 's office of departments and operations for which he is directly accountable . <p> Performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to conceal or cover up problems which should be identified and corrected . <p> Such audits by an independently elected official ( controller ) provide credibility and promote the public trust . <p> The mayor 's concern for independent audits is unjustified since he maintains responsibility for evaluating the audits and accepting , rejecting or modifying any recommendations . <p> Milton E. Perry , Houston <p> <p> Brady law stomps rights <p> The Chronicle Editorial Board demeans the Bill of Rights in its praise of the effects of the Brady law ( Editorial page , June 25 , " On target " ) . Just reading the numbers , I agree it is comforting to know that 69,000 applications for handgun sales were denied , mostly to convicted or indicted felons . Behind the numbers , though , is a trampling of rights . <p> I heard about a local man who received a felony indictment when he was caught - for a second time - illegally dumping construction material . Taking away one of his guaranteed rights from the Bill of Rights seems quite excessive . Justice would be better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a federal law blanketing the country and smothering all who fall under it . <p> David Reitz , Houston <p> <p> Disney stock a core fund <p> The members of the Texas Board of Education who voted to sell Disney stock should be removed from their positions . By making investment decisions based on personal preferences unsubstantiated by financial performance concerns , these members violated their fiduciary responsibility to Texas public school teachers . <p> Additionally , the claim that certain Disney films corrupt children is absurd , since these films ' " R " ratings prevent children from seeing them . As long as millions buy Disney movie tickets , Disney stock should be a core fund holding . <p> Nancy Otis Doyle , Houston <p> <p> Stock market is amoral <p> John Mahoney 's July 14 Outlook attack on the State Board of Education was a disgusting tribute to the way many Americans have sold their souls out for the dollar ( " Texans harmed by board 's ' Mickey Mouse ' decision " ) . His refusal to see nothing but the bottom line when dealing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laissez faire " capitalism . <p> If you follow his logic , things like illegal drugs and child pornography would be perfectly legal because they can produce a nice , tidy profit . <p> The market is amoral , it can not determine if something is right or not , only whether it is profitable . A smart investment is not necessarily a morally right investment , something that Mahoney does not seem to realize . <p> I applaud the education board for jettisoning the Disney stock , even if the action was purely symbolic . It gives me hope that there are still some government officials who care about more than just money . <p> Jack Tannous , Houston <p> <p> Finger-pointing no good <p> I am bemused by references to greed by both liberals and conservatives alike . There really is no way for one person to know what is in another 's heart . The old American Indian proverb is apt : Judge no man until you have walked a fortnight in his moccasins . <p> My own dear Catholic Church used to ( though not much , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own self but not of anyone else . That way of living seems to have escaped our modern society , to our detriment . How can we hope to improve ourselves if we keep pointing fingers at others ? <p> L. Wiles , Houston <p> <p> Confederate flag a symbol <p> It 's called a symbol of " hatred " by some and " Southern pride " by others . It was called a " negative icon " ( Viewpoints , July 7 ) . It is something for everyone , bringing out the best or the worst in people . At the least , the flag of the Confederacy is an integral part of our history . When it is finally and totally censored in this country , let the book burning begin , since other than being part of our history , it is only what you make of it . No matter what it means , as a society , we ca n't possibly know where we 're headed if we have no idea where we 've been . <p> Randy D. Taylor , Sugarland <p> <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' 40s and ' 50s in Baytown , I always heard , " Never eat oysters in a month without the letter R . " So , will someone please tell me why these people are harvesting and eating raw oysters in June and July ? <p> Patricia Thompson , Lufkin
