THEATER <P> Divinely Inspired or Deeply Deranged ? <P> TWO DRAMAS CONVERGE IN SHAW 'S SAINT JOAN . One is a political tale of a populist heroine put to death for taking seriously pietisms about God , King and country expounded by an elite that cares only about itself . The other is a metaphysical debate over whether this world has any place for the uncompromising rectitude of a saint . The shrewdness of Shaw 's text  --  and of Maryann Plunkett 's sturdy Broadway performance  --  is that both struggles are just as compelling whether the audience sees Joan as divinely inspired or as deeply deranged . The surrounding production by Tony Randall 's National Actors Theater is coarse , often verging on camp . But the play is all too timely . As Joan 's judges solemnly denounce the evil of religious heresy , one thinks of Salman Rushdie . <P> BOOKS <P> Tale of a Panther <P> " THE TRUE REVOLUTIONARY IS GUIDED by great feelings of love , " Che Guevara is quoted as saying in A TASTE OF POWER : A BLACK WOMAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard , author Elaine Brown is a genuine radical . She tells an absorbing story of real struggle : how she became the leader of the Black Panther Party , how she and the party battled racism , and how she fought sexism within the group . Her prose is unpretentious and involving . She makes the political personal by recounting her affair with Huey Newton , founder of the Panthers . Newton is revealed as a difficult man , sometimes violent , sometimes vulnerable , always brilliant . In the end , Brown discovers , love is the most demanding political act of all . <P> MUSIC <P> Knuckle Crackers <P> SCOTT JOPLIN , JAMES SCOTT AND JOSEPH Lamb may have been the Big Three composers of the ragtime era , but there were a host of others , many of them ( yes ! ) women . Twelve are represented on FLUFFY RUFFLE GIRLS , an irresistible CD by pianist Virginia Eskin ( Northeastern ) . May Aufderheide , probably the best known of the dozen , showed with infectious rags like The Thriller ! that she could crack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elegiac rags by the contemporary composer Judith Lang Zaimont , which prove there 's life in the old genre yet . Eskin captures all the insouciant charm of the country 's first great popular music , and firmly observes Joplin 's admonition that it is never right to play ragtime fast . Just well . <P> MUSIC <P> Turbo Twang from Good Ole Boys <P> IF THEIR LYRICS WERE N'T INTELLIGIBLE ( and intelligent ) and their voices did n't heartbreak on every third syllable , the GIBSON/MILLER BAND could pass for prime rockers , make big money and be forgotten by Labor Day . Instead , country can claim them as new stars of its make-believe barroom . On their album Where There 's Smoke , they are tough guys with heart and humor . They can taunt a lady friend 's angry father ( " Your daddy hates me/ Much as I love you . . . / He do n't know we 're a lot alike , / You been keepin ' us both awake all night " ) or wail like good ole boys stranded at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm gettin ' stoned , / She 's tyin ' the knot/ And I 'm tyin ' one on " ) . This is 90- proof vox-pop poetry , with a rhythm-guitar chaser . <P> CINEMA <P> Kindergarten Cops
