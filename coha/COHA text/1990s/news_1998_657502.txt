<p> In the early 1990s , M &T; Bank in Buffalo , N.Y. , wanted to do some charitable giving and was looking for a project that would really pack a punch . " The bank had done well , " says Robert Wilmers , M &T's; chairman and CEO , " and we felt we wanted to pay the community back in some way . " Instead of making contributions to a variety of causes , the bank decided to spend its money all in one place : School 68 , a run-down public elementary school located in a neighborhood where 9 out of 10 families live below the poverty level . The result has been a true Cinderella story . In five years , School 68 - renamed the Westminster Community School - went from having among the lowest scores in the city on standardized tests to ranking among the top half of Buffalo schools . The once-dilapidated building today is bright and shiny . Each crisply repainted classroom boasts four computers , and students enjoy expanded instruction in art and music , in addition to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school , where the student body is about 90 percent African-American , has leaped from 314 to 565 as parents who once fought to get their kids out of School 68 now ca n't wait to get them in . School 68 's turnaround is part of a trend that 's been on the rise since the 1970s , says Janice Petrovich , director for education , knowledge , and religion at The Ford Foundation in New York . From individual entrepreneurs adopting a single class to corporations adopting clusters of schools , private-sector involvement in public schools has produced a number of success stories . And while a serious corporate commitment to a single school along the lines of the M &T; project is an unusual one , Dr. Petrovich predicts such private-public cooperations will continue to increase as businesses realize the urgent need " to invest in the work force of the future .

What fascinates some about the story of School 68 is that it 's more than a simple tale of dollars and cents . John Carmichael , M &T's; vice president of commercial marketing , who served as liaison to the school and for three years devoted the bulk of his working hours to problem-solving for the school , insists that the most desperate need at School 68 was not for money - but for caring and energetic management . " What we bring to the table is our understanding of business and management and getting things done , " he says . Even while agreeing that some of the spending the bank did was crucial , Mr. Carmichael maintains , " We probably could have spent half what we did , and still seen the same improvement in test scores . " Bank managers found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the result of a rather unique arrangement pioneered by Wilmers and the Buffalo Board of Education . Together they created a Board of Trustees to govern the school , consisting of representatives from both the city school system and the bank , and agreed that the city would continue to provide basic services for the school , with the bank providing funding for projects above and beyond what the city would have spent on its own ( see time line below ) . The first big challenge the new board faced was also perhaps its most essential one : recruiting a principal equipped to engineer a turnaround . Wilmers and some others involved remember the 18-month period during which the bank conducted a nationwide search as one of the most exhausting and discouraging phases of the project . But in August , 1994 , Yvonne Minor-Ragan was finally brought on board . Dr. Ragan , an energetic principal who 'd already won commendation for turning around a failing Chicago middle school , was exactly the powerhouse the search committee had hoped to find . To lure Ragan to Buffalo , M @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal salary the Board of Education agreed to offer her . <p> New principal , new rules The new principal hit the ground running . Within weeks of arriving she forced the closing of a crack house operating across the street from the school and persuaded 150 parents to attend a school meeting - a considerable achievement in a school where meetings never drew more than a handful of parents . She also made it clear to the school 's teachers that serious change was under way - and that being part of it would require hard work , including professional development workshops and meetings outside of normal school hours . Within three years of her arrival there was more than 50 percent turnover in school staff . According to Ragan , only one teacher was forced to leave . Others , she says , quit or opted for transfers to other Buffalo schools . Ragan describes her own style as " lots of praising and hugging " and she makes a point of knowing all the school 's students by their first names . But she 's also instituted tough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't hesitate to suspend those who step out of line . In addition , she takes a tough stand on minor infractions such as tardiness . Not everyone likes Ragan 's style . Some visitors to the school have labeled her respect for order exaggerated , and find the control exercised over teachers and students to be too tight . But many parents say they love the more orderly atmosphere . " Dr. Ragan 's the best thing that could have happened to this school , " enthuses one father as he drops his second-grade daughter off at her homeroom . " We owe everything to her . " From the bank 's point of view , Wilmers insists that " about 90 percent " of the project 's success can be attributed to Ragan . In fact , working with Ragan and with the school has been an education in itself for the bank , says Wilmers . He 's been struck by the simple fact that , " Education is complicated . There are no shortcuts . It 's a lot of hard work . " It also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first-hand about the yards of red tape that can gum up the gears of a school system . At one point , the bank purchased a new phone system for the school , but then had to wait two years for it to be installed . Educators , Wilmers says , often endure conditions businesspeople would consider intolerable . <p> Looking ahead As the project moves into its fifth year , Wilmers wants to see further academic progress . " How , " he wonders , " do we get even higher ? " He hopes professional development workshops now being offered the school 's teachers by consultants from Columbia University 's Teacher College in New York will provide the answer . But in the Kensington-Bailey neighborhood surrounding the school , residents do n't hesitate to cheer the project 's success . Each September Ragan leads a back-to-school parade through the neighborhood streets , and locals say it lifts their hearts and spirits to see the kids marching in the school 's unofficial uniform of black skirts or pants and white shirts .
