Wrong again . the conventional wisdom was so sure of itself : as soon as Colin Powell started talking issues , said the pols and pundits and even Powell himself , the sheen would fade . " I am fully aware that in taking stands on issues , " Powell said , " I will quickly burn off popularity . " But 10 days after Powell finally began speaking his mind , his standing has soared . New polls have him running about dead even with Bill Clinton and Bob Dole in a hypothetical three-way race ; and Powell even manages a statistical tie with Dole for the G.O.P. nomination . Three weeks ago , Powell professed to lack the fire in the belly for a White House run . Now , he admits , " there may be a pilot light burning . " <P> What 's going on here ? Are fickle voters again signaling their preference for the new and different and seemingly nonpolitical ? Has a nation vexed by its racial divisions fallen in love with a self-described " nonthreatening kind of black man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of titillation ? He 's been " out there " for just a week , but we 've already glimpsed Powell 's shrewdness  --  and it now seems more likely that he 'd run as a Republican than as an independent . <P> As only a maybe-candidate ostensibly free of having to measure the political effect of his views , Powell claims to be enjoying a rare moment of freedom : " I can now say exactly what I believe . " Well , yes , in the midst of the conservative drift , Powell has indeed expressed some strong opinions . On race relations , he has forthrightly confirmed the obvious : " The playing field is n't level . Some forms of affirmative action are still needed . " On welfare , Powell is almost alone in worrying about the kids who 'll suffer when their mothers ' benefits are cut . But overall , Powell has said a lot without saying much at all ; the true explanation for his popularity may simply be that most Americans share his views . For example : Powell supports the death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He favors some gun control , as do most of the rest of us . Ditto for Powell 's embrace of a moment of silence in school , abortion rights , **28;3043;TOOLONG sentencing laws and a host of other items he calls " the specifics . " <P> But ask Powell to go beyond the headlines , and the red flags fly . " So being pro-choice means you 'd support soldiers getting abortions at military hospitals , " I asked last week . " I really have n't thought through using public funds for things like that , " Powell said . Perhaps not , but no one who knows him thinks there is much of anything Colin Powell has n't thought through . In this instance , Powell 's nonresponse , which robs his pro-choice stance of an important real-world consequence , reveals caution rather than ignorance  --  and a finely honed political instinct as well . To a favorite Powell maxim , " Do n't make a decision until you have to , " one should probably add , " And do n't rub it in unless you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Powell is a skilled actor . In describing the hoopla of his book tour cum potential campaign , Powell repeatedly called his adventure " a kind of coming-out party . " On at least three occasions when he used that line , Powell paused and appeared thoughtful  --  as if conjuring a neat formulation for the first time .
