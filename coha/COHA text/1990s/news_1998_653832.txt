<p> When Howard Patterson strode to the podium here last month , he was applauded wildly by several dozen car dealers , each of whom had paid from $25,000 to $60,000 to acquire a franchise for the fledgling Eurasia Motor Corporation of Fort Lauderdale , Fla . Mr. Patterson , Eurasia 's chief executive , had promised to deliver a line of vehicles called Gazelles , ranging from a $5,995 sedan to the $30,000 Avalanche , " the largest sport utility vehicle ever produced . " <p> For 18 months , the dealers had seen nothing but pictures of a quickly changing mix of vehicles , but now , they thought , they were moments away from the real thing . <p> Not that every Eurasia dealer had waited patiently . " I think it was a scam from the very beginning , " said Chuck Pond , owner of Action Automotive in Mobile , Ala. , who paid $25,000 that was supposed to be set aside in an escrow account only to discover that Eurasia got the money . He is one of at least nine dealers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get their money back from what many fear was a coast-to-coast swindle . <p> If the dealers who are suing are right , it is a highly unusual swindle , one aimed not at the elderly and the gullible , but at car dealers , typically among the shrewdest people around . <p> But then Mr. Patterson is a persuasive fellow . " Howard can make you believe anything , " said Jene Jones , his former secretary . " He can make you believe the sun will go down at noon . " <p> Publicity about Eurasia has largely been limited to skeptical accounts in Automotive News , a trade publication , but there have been a number of red flags . <p> Arthur W. Porter , a lawyer from Colorado representing many of the dealers , said Eurasia raised as much as $10 million in less than two years . Neither he nor a Miami collection agency hired by Simpson Honda of Bozeman , Mont. , however , can find evidence that it now has any of that . <p> In addition to spawning lawsuits by dealers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debts to suppliers and employees . In recent months it has been evicted from buildings in Texas and Florida . Moreover , the company 's No. 2 executive is a convicted felon . <p> Meanwhile , Mr. Patterson , through his lawyer , Alexander Lasnaud of Boca Raton , Fla. , declined to say when or where he was born or to provide a resume , but he acknowledged that he is also known as Michael Howard Weiner . <p> In interviews here , though , Mr. Patterson , who at 40 is tanned and well muscled , denied any impropriety , saying that Eurasia Motors is legitimate and " the victim of a conspiracy by former employees . " <p> But he declined to answer questions about how checks written to the trust account of his company 's former general counsel ended up with his company . And he would not talk about Jules Pier , the Eurasia marketing director , whom he calls his most trusted aide . Mr. Pier , Florida records show , is on active probation for grand theft in a 1996 case . Mr. Pier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born in January 1997 , there were signs that its public image did not match reality . <p> Mr. Patterson said he was the sole owner , but incorporation papers list the owners as Michaelann Konko , his companion , and Jill Pier , Mr. Pier 's wife . <p> From the start , Eurasia often revised its brochures and videos , which promised sport utility vehicles to be built in Britain or Romania or South Africa or Brazil or Texas . Engines were to be supplied by Cosworth or Ford or Chrysler or Citroen or Daewoo or Peugeot . But one company after another issued statements disavowing any ties to Eurasia . <p> Last fall the company repeatedly promised to display a vehicle at the National Automobile Dealers Association annual meeting in New Orleans . No vehicle materialized . <p> By early summer , dealers from Alabama , Arizona , Colorado , Florida , Montana and South Dakota sued Eurasia , some for fraud . A few called the Federal Bureau of Investigation , as did some employees . The bureau issued subpoenas , and one employee said he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bureau apparently dropped the case . The agent working the case did not return phone calls . <p> All the while , Eurasia kept signing up dealers . <p> Even many dealers who know about the lawsuits hold Mr. Patterson in high regard . Bob Lanphere , head of a family business with seven dealerships in Oregon and Washington and the owner of two Eurasia franchises and a parts distributorship , spoke admiringly of him during the event in Maine . <p> He dismissed the suits as the product of " naysayers out there doing more harm than good and putting roadblocks to Howard 's reaching his dream . " He added later that he hoped " this all works out because I 've got $170,000 in this . " <p> In a hotel meeting room here , Mr. Patterson toyed with his Rolex as his public relations man , Bob Holtzman of Citigate Communications , rallied a group of dealers , the room throbbing to the beat of Neil Diamond singing " Coming to America . " <p> When his moment came , the music tapered off and Mr. Patterson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for hours and tell you stories of corporate intrigue , " he said , " but I do n't think that 's what you are here for , so let 's go see some Gazelles . " <p> Outside , protected by two police officers , stood three vehicles . " They have cars , " said an excited Jacob Amuial , a used-car dealer in Norfolk , Va . " Now we know this is for real . " <p> But that was open to question . One tiny car stood with both doors locked , its hood closed , its emblem torn from the black plastic grille . It was  --  said a man who identified himself as Catalin Tulano  --  an Oltcit , a Citroen-designed vehicle last made several years ago in Romania . <p> Mr. Tulano said that he owned " all the tools and dies and rights to this car " and that the machinery , now in crates in a Romanian warehouse , would soon be shipped to Mexico so he could build cars for Eurasia . Mr. Tulano would not give his company 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Nearby stood a pair of off-road vehicles , a yellow truck and what looked like a Jeep on steroids , painted red with a black canvas top . They were consumer versions of French military vehicles and built at J.P.X. , a small factory in Pouso Alegre , Brazil . In six years the factory has produced 6,000 , mostly for sale in former French colonies in Africa , according to Francois Servanin , a former race-car driver who said he has a contract to build vehicles in the factory . <p> People lined up for test drives of the off-road vehicles , which proved sturdy , underpowered and hard to steer . Mr. Patterson said he would import 10,000 to 20,000 a year from Brazil , starting in December . The tiny sedan , to be called the Modesto , would be available in 1999 , to be followed by the Avalanche . <p> The Avalanche featured in one brochure is made by Jurassic Truck , in Arlington , Tex. , which says it has no connection to Eurasia and whose owner , Timothy Barton , is cooperating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air bags or emission controls , but Mr. Patterson told the crowd not to worry  --  that they would have them approved within three months . Spokesmen for the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said they had no record of Eurasia , the Gazelle brand , Mr. Patterson or his top associates . Clean-air approvals could take more than a year , Steve Page of the E.P.A . said . <p> While Mr. Patterson said Eurasia was financially sound , it was evicted from buildings in Corpus Christi , Tex. , in the spring , and in Fort Lauderdale in August . <p> Mr. Patterson said he was unaware of any unpaid rent or evictions . " I am the C.E.O. , and lower-level people deal with things like that , if that happened , " he said . <p> Nine former employees said they were out tens of thousands of dollars for wages , expenses and advances made to Eurasia at Mr. Patterson 's request . Mr. Patterson said no one had ever told him about bounced checks . Two former employees who handled money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it was diverted to Mr. Patterson and his associates . Beth Feldman , Eurasia 's treasurer until she left last fall , said in an affidavit filed in Federal court in Colorado that money from new dealers was " used to finance a lavish life style " for Mr. Patterson and others , not " for the acquisition , development , importation , certification , purchase and sale of the Gazelle or any other vehicle . " <p> Ms. Feldman , who said Eurasia charged $18,000 to her personal credit cards , said she came to believe it " was created solely as a fraud . " <p> Ms. Jones , who became Mr. Patterson 's secretary when Eurasia moved to Corpus Christi in late 1997 , said that when each dealer 's check came in she was instructed to wire the money immediately to a bank account whose ownership and location she did not know . <p> She and three other former employees said that as bills piled up and paychecks bounced , Mr. Patterson acquired a Mercedes-Benz sports car , a Harley-Davidson motorcycle , a couple of Rolex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Island and sailed a yacht . <p> Jurgen Sass , Eurasia 's parts and service manager in Corpus Christi , said he never saw any evidence that money was spent on parts or tools . He said that to stop one eviction , he personally paid $6,800 in rent , which he never got back . <p> Ms. Jones said people kept working when paychecks stopped because they believed in Mr. Patterson . But he left town in May without paying them , the employees said . <p> Mr. Patterson said he had never improperly taken dealers ' money . " My wife and I do not live a lavish life style , " he said . " We live appropriate to our means . " Later , through Mr. Lasnaud , he declined to comment on Ms. Feldman 's statement and Ms. Jones 's remarks . <p> Eurasia also faces problems with multiple sales of franchises in the same region . Robert Ingram of Norfolk , Va. , and Robert Crumpler of Newport News , Va. , each paid $30,000 for exclusive Gazelle franchises in the same territory as Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went into debt to buy his franchise , and Mr. Crumpler , a Nissan dealer , said they would gladly back out if they got their money back . <p> Court records also show that three dealers paid $30,000 each for an exclusive franchise for Colorado and that two did so in South Dakota . Most of those dealers are suing , as are dealers in Montana , Arizona , Alabama and Florida , some of whom obtained default judgments in recent weeks when Eurasia did not appear in court to defend itself . <p> Could Eurasia live up to its promises ? It is a giant leap from bringing three vehicles to a parking lot in Maine to manufacturing and importing 20,000 vehicles a year worth more than $300 million . <p> Still , Mr. Patterson said he would soon have the financing he needed because each dealer would have to give Eurasia a $225,000 letter of credit , to be used as collateral for loans from Union Planters Bank in Fort Lauderdale . <p> Despite the unpaid bills , Phillip G. McNally , a senior vice president at Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the financing . " We see an opportunity to do some business on a legitimate basis , " he said . <p> Mr. Barton , owner of Jurassic Truck , said in an interview that Mark Weiner , who identified himself as Mr. Patterson 's brother , came to see him at the factory where he turns the frames of old Chevrolet Suburbans into the T-Rex , the world 's largest sport utility vehicle . <p> " Mr. Weiner asked me to make a knock-off of an off-road vehicle called the Ibex so it could be shown to dealers in New Orleans in February , " he said . " I told him it was a bizarre request but even if I wanted to there were only a few weeks left and that was not enough time . " <p> He said Mr. Weiner , who declined to be interviewed , persisted , saying that with the right approach a knock-off could be made in time . " It does n't have to actually run , " Mr. Barton quoted Mr. Weiner as saying . " It just has to look @ @ @ @
