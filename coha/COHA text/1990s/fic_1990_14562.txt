A beautiful summer 's night in the outskirts of Hillsbottom . Two girls sit in a parked car talking about things . Both are dressed in Ku Klux Klan garb . JUDY Molly , do you know why God created the world the way he did ? So complicated , I mean . ( Pause . ) MOLLY Nope . JUDY Because I 've been thinking about it , and I just get more and more puzzled . MOLLY So do I. JUDY Because if there is a divine plan it sure does n't look it , very divine , that is . Or planlike . It looks kinda like a mess . MOLLY Most of the time , when I think about big things , things like God , and the end of nature , and global warming , and so on , I feel like I do n't know anything at all . JUDY That 's just how I feel . Like I do n't know anything . It 's really scary . I mean I do n't know the name of the state capital . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I could n't name more than two or three South American countries , and I 'm not much better when it comes to Europe . MOLLY I do n't know the difference between good art and bad art . I have n't a clue what a " hostile takeover " is , nor why junk bonds are junky . I mean why would anybody want them if they 're worthless ? It does n't make any sense . p. 3 JUDY I do n't know why the sky is blue , and I do n't know what " blue " is , and I do n't know why I do n't know . ( Pause . ) I do n't know anything . I mean , when you come right down to it , I do n't know a blessed thing , and you know ? I do n't care , I do n't care that I do n't know anything because I strongly suspect that nobody else knows anything either . MOLLY You think they 're just pretending ? JUDY I think they 're all faking it , particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people in positions of authority , and celebrities on TV , and in the halls of Congress , in the churches and klonvocations , and on the radio , even in the middle of the night , when we are all asleep , except Poky the cat . Poky the cat knows . ( Long pause . ) Sometimes I wonder if I 'm really named Judy , and that freaks me out , because if I am not then who am I , and if I do n't have a real name what am I ? Maybe I do n't exist and this is some kind of a cruel joke my family is playing on me , and I would n't put it past them , particularly Dexter , my brother . He says he has a crush on you . But I do n't know if Dexter 's capable of such a thing , he 's such a klutz he could n't spell I.Q. if you spotted him the " Q , " and he does n't know much of anything , any more than I do . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think probably God has a plan for all things , and I think the proof of this plan is in the pudding . I mean , why else would we not know anything , unless there were an intelligent being out there , somewhere , whose cunning idea it was that you and I , Judy and Molly , should be forever ignorant of the true nature of things , ignorant forever in absolute sincerity . Does Dexter really have a crush on me , or did he just say he did ? p. 4 JUDY I think the absolute sincerity part of it is the most important , because it 's real hard not to know anything unless you are perfectly sincere about it . I ca n't remember whether he told me he had this crush on you , or I just dreamed it up , or came to that conclusion because he asked what your name was . MOLLY I think there is this mystic furball that has infected the whole town with its poison of ignorance , and that 's why none of us know anything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JUDY What 's a mystic furball ? MOLLY I do n't think I can explain . JUDY How could it make us not know anything ? MOLLY I do n't know . JUDY Then why did you say it did ? MOLLY That it did what ? JUDY You know . Make us dumb . MOLLY It did n't make us dumb . It made us ignorant . They are n't the same . JUDY But how did it do this ? MOLLY How do I know ? It was just an idea , a shot in the dark , you do n't have to get so worked up about it all , you know . JUDY Sorry . p. 5 MOLLY Judy . JUDY Yes , what is it ? MOLLY What if , maybe , I only think I 'm Molly and that in fact I 'm Judy and you 're Molly and that somehow we got all mixed up , tragically , walking back from school , and the mystic furball did it to us to prevent us from finding his hiding place out in the backyard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead leaves beside the doghouse , or behind the elm tree , or up on the roof above the dormers , or on the weather vane on top of the barn , over there , Mr. Whatsisname 's barn , or deep in the ground , where the standpipes are , where we 're not supposed to go , near the toxic waste dump site , where some pretty creepy stuff is supposed to be leaching into the subsoil and will eventually contaminate the groundwater and all the people for miles around will have to go around in plastic bags , on tippy toes . JUDY What makes you think you know all this stuff ? MOLLY I do n't . JUDY Then why did you say it ? MOLLY Overheard someone at school . Guess I got carried away . JUDY But who said it ? MOLLY Who said what ? JUDY The stuff about the furball ? p. 6 MOLLY George , or Lloyd . You know , the gawky string-bean guy , the guy who said he pissed on a skunk . JUDY That was Lloyd , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's not what you said . MOLLY That is too . JUDY That is not . MOLLY But the most important thing is not what you know , but whether you 're sincere or not . That 's what I think . JUDY That 's what I think too . If I do n't know anything else I know that . I think MOLLY Sincerity forever . JUDY Right . ( Blackout. ) @x Two guys sitting in another car . Talking . They also are decked out in Klan garb . Nice night , moon , bugs . A woman with a heavy suitcase approaches , but stands off a bit in the bushes , unseen . This is JESUS H. CHRIST . She bolds a long , black staff . TOM Hank , you 're so fucking dumb , you 're as dumb as the north end of something headed south . Something kinda all time monster stupid . HANK Guess I am . But shit , you do n't know much of anything yourself , Tom . You got to admit . When it comes right down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . But I got sincerity . You , you do n't have no sincerity . Plus , you do n't know nothing . That 's a heavy weight to bear . HANK I always was a devious son-of-a-bitch . So I guess you 're right . The way I look at it , this is the hollow time of humanity . It do n't matter if we do n't know nothing , because we are looking for an event , an event that will change all this weirdness , all this mediocre everydayness into something higher . Meaningful . And transcendent . Just because I was never good at chemistry or economics or algebra , and flunked out of Hillsbottom Junior College do n't mean moosedick . It do n't mean moosedick because I have a special thing inside my head , here , under this pointy hat . And this thing which I am referring to is my infinitely precious human soul , which is worth more than knowledge , because what you know is subject to the corrosive work of time , dry rot , entropy , alien @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God and all his works , through the malign agency of the devil who labors in the fiery furnace of hell , knitting together the warp and woof of human delusion . And that ai n't beanbag. p. 8 TOM I say a skunk is a skunk is a skunk and he ought to be rooted up , and took out and shot , and left to rot by the side of the road . You 're not talking normal , Hank . HANK I say that I worry a lot about things like nontemporal unaccountability and infinite regress and the fiery pit . I worry a lot about hell , and where it is , and what it looks like , and who lives there , and who receives which torment , and what these torments feel like , since if I was capable of feeling the true nature of these torments for even the fraction of a second I might know how to amend the howling madness of my ways , even though I 'd most like remain for sure an ignorant cuss and not worth a crap in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eye of the least of the angels in the radiant economy of heaven . ( Pause . Looks puzzled . ) Now , what the hell was it I was driving at ? TOM You were saying you would sure bust your ass to amend the error of your ways . HANK That 's it , that 's what I would do , take up my load and run with it till , till I find someplace where I could dump it down , where it would be safe , and I would be free of these insane dreams of fur fur and furrrrrrr TOM Fur ? HANK Fur , and furballs . ( Pause. ) p. 9 TOM Hank , there 's something the matter with you . Something not right , something wrong inside your head , with your brain . HANK I am John Q. Fedup is what is wrong with me . I got a whole lot of lead weights bearing down on me , inside my head , under this pointy cloak . You could n't imagine what it 's like having this infernal thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This life sentence for eternity , which I never asked for , because like I said , I confess to not knowing a damn thing , nor the subtle ramifications of this not knowing , because all such not knowing is as bad as knowing , and I would rather be rid of both than go to heaven even , which is my dark secret and a bad thought , but it 's the truth , so help me God . I mean , why is this heaven any better than hell ? I mean , really , why ! ? I do n't mean to be a wiseass , I 'm just curious , that 's all . ( Pause . ) TOM Hank , you 're a snake is what you are , a viper . Here you sit , wearing your human flesh , wearing the cloth of creation * and you dare JESUS H. CHRIST Pardon me . TOM Pardon me , ma'am . We are having a little conversation . ( He Continues talking with HANK . ) The garment of flesh which the good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your heart than to soil it with this doubt , this badass cynicism . No wonder you say you do n't know nothing . Now . Now me , I , too , may be as dumb as a post , and unclear about the multiplication table , the boundaries of more than a half dozen states , and unable to repair my own toilet , but dammit , Hank , if the English language was good enough for Jesus H. Christ then it 's good enough for me . Furthermore , I do not feel compelled by reason to accept this theory of evolution , nor the periodic table of elements , nor the theory of global warming , nor the supposed crimes against the Jews attributed to one Rudolf Hitler . Nor the spherical nature of the earth , because it 's against the law of nature and we would fall off for sure and my motto is : never explain , never apologize . As for the dead , they got no rights . So , I too am John Q. Fedup , and we 'll both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the happy land to come . Or the other place , which is where your soul , sure as hell , shall end up if you do n't get a hold on yourself and cut out this bonehead crap and act normal like a man should and just get on with it . Now what can I do for you , stranger ? ( Pause . JESUS puts down her heavy bag and the earth trembles . Pause. ) p. 10 JESUS H. CHRIST This would n't be the town of Hillsbottom , would it ? TOM It might be , and then it might not be . HANK What do you got in that there weighty box ? JESUS H. CHRIST **25;2967;TOOLONG machinery . HANK She 's crazy . JESUS H. CHRIST You want to answer my question , Bud ? TOM Go fuck yourself . JESUS H. CHRIST You amaze me , gentlemen . Even though , even though nothing that was , was done did without my sayso it seems like nobody roundabout here do n't know it , and that 's a fact . You set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like you just ate a five-hundred-pound canary , when you are in a parlous state . That 's right , because there is a furball here in Hillsbottom . I can detect it with my apparatus . Maybe even two . I can not only detect ' em with my apparatus , I am able to destroy ' em with my mind , because this furball is no ordinary furball , no , it am a mystic furball , nay , a monster furball , of the tribe of Abaddon and Belial , and are therefore a spirit of negation , and this furball do n't give a crap whether you cling to the angel of you ignorance , this furball am bodacious and am like to bust down boundaries between things , things dear to you , and this despite the innocence of your down-home cracker ignorance , because this time ignorance wo n't save you as it used to was in the pretty times done did , so many times afore , during the Season of Dread and the Season of Bloating , when the mighty leviathan ( pause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this serious , as you should . I see you are mocking me , in your heart , with your vileness and pride and lust and superstition and greed and moron stupefaction , and I feel had . I feel like a loyal lover who has , been rejected , and who has wearied of the object of her love , and therefore feels a disappointment . Do you know what hell is like ? For I have been to the place , and know what it looks like . p. 11 TOM Yeah , you 've been to hell , and my name is Edsel Ford . JESUS H. CHRIST Surely , I have been to hell and know the place , for it was I who caused it to be riven . ( Her staff turns into a snake . She begins to go offstage . ) HANK Oh yeah , what does it look like ? JESUS H. CHRIST Hell looks very much like Hillsbottom . ( She goes out . Pause . They laugh. ) @x Another wonderful night , but strange . Two lovers in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Klan way . In the bushes a FURBALL spies upon them . JUDY Do you believe that terrible things always have to happen , or out ? I mean , if it 's possible for some really gross and disgusting event to happen , do you think it has to , or not , which ? GEORGE Never really thought about it . JUDY Neither did I , until right now . GEORGE The way I look at it , we must all have a purpose , a purpose that God keeps hidden from us . JUDY How do you mean ? GEORGE Well , if God informed us upfront of why we were put on earth there would n't be any surprises in it . God must 've felt he needed to liven things up , by keeping the true purpose of all this hidden . Secret , and stuff . JUDY Sometimes , I do wish He had made it a little clearer , though . I mean like with car crashes . Child abuse . The divorce rate , and stuff . The sacred and mystical rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West Hillsbottom , all those people downwind with growths , and how you 're not supposed to drink the well water in East Hillsbottom , and stuff . p. 13 GEORGE That 's not been proven . JUDY That 's not proven , but it 's suspicious . People say it is very likely a big worry . GEORGE It has not been scientifically proven , otherwise those in charge of the facility would come out and say so . This is not a case of God 's will being murky or his plan for us , it is just a case of the evidence not being all in . JUDY If the evidence were all in , would it make any difference , as far as God 's will goes ? That 's what I mean . GEORGE I do n't think so , because nuclear pollution might still be a part of God 's design , I mean his plan for Hillsbottom . We might not be able to fathom that plan , is all . JUDY Then we 're better off not knowing that plan . GEORGE That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , Judy . JUDY George , I feel so reverent when I think of all the things I do n't know , and how majestic the summer sky is at night , and how much God must love us , how much he must have cared all along , millions of years ago , before he had any idea that you or I might exist . GEORGE You know , I 've been thinking about you all week . JUDY I did n't think you liked me. p. 14 GEORGE I told Carol I had a crush on you , and I 'd kill her if she told anyone . JUDY I ca n't believe it . I thought I was the one with the crush . GEORGE I thought you thought I was n't part of the " in " crowd . JUDY I ca n't stand those guys . They 're such snobs . I ca n't stand conceited people . GEORGE Neither can I. People who think they 're better than you , just because they drive a Corvette their father gave them . Like Ralph . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went out with Ralph for six months . JUDY Even then I could n't stand that about him . First I had a crush on him because I thought he was cute and stuff . But pretty soon I wised up and realized he was n't sincere . Actually he was a jerk , and just did things to impress his friends . Like Chainsaw and Dragon-wagon . Gross . And the furball guy . Whatsisname . Actually I only went out with him because he drove a red Corvette . Red 's my favorite color . GEORGE I thought you were madly in love with him . JUDY I was n't . GEORGE Are you sure ? JUDY What are you talking about ? You 're the one who was making googly eyes all over Susan Hanahan all during the field trip to the museum . Was it the museum ? p. 15 GEORGE No , it was the nuclear power plant . It was in the cooling unit JUDY Well , you were the one who * was making eyes at her . GEORGE I was not making eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure she had someone who could give her the lowdown on who to hang out with . I did not find her attractive . I found her pathetic , actually . But that was before I realized she had this crush on that slob Randolph . Can you believe it ? JUDY I still can not believe that . I still can not believe anyone could possibly have a crush on someone so nerdy and insincere as Randolph . GEORGE It 's bad enough to be nerdy and insincere , but to be nerdy and insincere like Randolph is enough to make a person positively gag . ( Pause . ) JUDY I have a crush on you . GEORGE I have a monster crush on you . ( They laugh . ) JUDY I did n't think anything like this would happen . I just thought you thought you were doing me a favor because my friends are n't as cool as your friends . GEORGE Your friends are just as cool as my friends . I figured you might not go out with me , well , on account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dad being this famous pervert and all and socially unacceptable and stuff , not that any of it means moosedick to me , hell , my whole family went bankrupt and stuff . We are n't exactly the country club set p. 16 JUDY George , I do n't care about what all those snobs think . I think you are a very sincere person , and that is the most important to me . GEORGE Really , Judy ? JUDY Yes , George , it is . GEORGE I 've never felt this good before . JUDY Neither have I. It 's really wonderful . ( Pause . ) Do you believe in God , George ? GEORGE I did n't used to think I did , but when I think about us , and all the terrific feelings I have for you , then I think there must be a God , a god who has arranged for everything to work out perfectly , the way it should . JUDY I feel that way too . I feel very sure that you will accomplish wonderful things in your life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . GEORGE I do n't know , Judy , sometimes I feel I 'm not up to life 's challenges . JUDY Just because you 've had some rough times does n't mean you wo n't be up to the challenges of life . I think you 've been very brave . And your dad was really looked up at , that 's what my mom said . And Dad , too , before he got strange . They said your dad was the best Kludd they ever had at the big klonvocations . It must 've been real hard to have him go like that . p. 17 GEORGE Jdark , he said , and croaked . JUDY What ? GEORGE At the hospital . That 's what he said . Jdark , and then he rolled over and died . Terminal furball . Furball in the windpipe . JUDY Oh , that sounds awful . GEORGE I meant tail pipe . There was this furball that somehow got lodged in the tail pipe of his Ranchero . Did something bad to the whatchamacallit . The throttle spring thing got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brakes locked , spun out . He could 've put the clutch in , but he did n't . Stubborn cuss . Took the steep hill up by Route Seven at fifty-five . Old Pancake Road up by Sandman 's Creek . He made the first turn , witnesses say , somehow . No one ever did it that fast before . That 's what they say . JUDY He must 've been quite a man . GEORGE He went into the hairpin turn on top of Old Boabdil at seventy . Took out a ninety-year-old oak with him and tore off the edge of Dead Man 's Gulch . The drop is about five hundred feet . Into the rapids just beneath the falls . It took them three hours to cut him out of the wreck . He was still alive . They took him to the county hospital , but he was n't conscious anymore . They called us and we got there just in time . He woke up , just before he passed on . Jdark , be said and croaked . p. 18 JUDY That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . That was all .

But really dead and empty inside .

What new idea has shuddered , stumbled , and lurched forth from the monastic stillness of your furry brain ? What histories have you penned , chronicling the hidden purpose behind the vast scenes of horror and pandemonium of human action , scenes hitherto thought meaningless , dark , and inaccessible to the light of reason ? What foodstuffs have you planted and hoed , nurtured with your own furry meathooks , through your own furry labors , and by the sweat of your furry brow , and processed , bottled , and crated up for the common good ?

What humble , odious , but high-minded and necessary public service have you rendered , toiling in obscurity , all for the good of others , with no recompense expected or asked for , within the heroic purity of your innermost heart ? What joys have you given others , in the form of small gifts or meaningless little gestures of basic human goodwill and positive-mindedness , which might  --  if only for a moment  --  lighten the load of those less fortunate than you , those even more bestial and craven , those lost in blind despair within the horrid attics of existence , driven crazy by bats , skunks , and rodents in the insulation and under the floorboards ; those whose destiny is other than yours , the overlooked , the under valued , the unsightly , the woebegone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the doomed , the dead .

TOM Your friends are just as cool as my friends . I figured you might not go out with me , well , on account of how I do n't know anything , and your dad being this famous pervert and all and socially unacceptable and stuff , not that any of it means moosedick to me , hell , my whole family went bankrupt and stuff . We are n't exactly the country club set . p. 27 LLOYD Tom , I do n't care about what all those snobs think . I think you are a very sincere person , and that is the most important to me . TOM Really , Lloyd ? LLOYD Yes , Tom , it is . TOM I 've never felt this good before . LLOYD Neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Do you believe in God , Tom ? TOM I did n't used to think I did , but when I think about us , and all the terrific feelings I have for you then I think there must be a God , a god who has arranged for everything to work out perfectly , the way it should . LLOYD I feel that way too . I feel very sure that you will accomplish wonderful things in your life , Tom , and that you will go to heaven . TOM I do n't know , Lloyd , sometimes I feel I 'm not up to life 's challenges . LLOYD Hold my hand , Tom . ( They hold hands . Pause . ) Life is so mystical sometimes .

( Slow blackout ) @x Another nice night , another parked car . The two girls sit in the car , bitching . They 've been corrupted by the presence of FURBALLS in Hillsbottom . JUDY Molly , do you know why God created the world the way he did ? So complicated , I mean . ( pause . ) MOLLY Shit on you , why do n't you fucking get off my case , you moron . JUDY Because I 've been thinking about it , and I just get more and more puzzled . MOLLY Fucking dickbreath is what you are . Fucking monster crapface . JUDY Because if there is a divine plan it sure does n't look it , very divine , that is . Or planlike . It looks kinda like a mess . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these fucking pussies till they turn puke green and belly up , the stupid fucks . JUDY That 's just how I feel . Like I do n't know anything . It 's really scary . I mean I do n't know the name of the state capital . I do n't know what my dad does at work . I could n't name more than two or three South American countries , and I 'm not much better when it comes to Europe . MOLLY I mean , I really ca n't stand this fucking place ; it 's like an itch you ca n't scratch , a scab that 's driving you crazy , or a really gross and disgusting bald spot on the head of somebody you really ca n't stand . p. 30 JUDY I do n't know the difference between good art and bad art . I have n't a clue what a hostile takeover is , nor why junk bonds are junky . I mean why would anybody want them if they 're worthless ? It does n't make any sense . I mean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . I mean , it 's all so fucking decent and god-fearing and goody-two-shoes and law-abiding and thankful and smarmy and sentimental and full of wishful thinking and sugarcoated bad faith and chintzy , cheesy , boring mediocrity it makes me want to gag . I mean all these totally square fuckheads who only care about God and family and communication and community and law and order and morality and safe sex and global warming and Jesus H. Christ and the whole moldy , wornout crock of shit . It makes me want to spew and leave my lunch all over their well-manicured lawns . MOLLY I mean , these fucking losers do n't have a fucking clue . Fucking smart-ass bigots and liars . JUDY You think they 're just pretending ? MOLLY I think they 're all faking it , particularly our parents , our teachers , our social betters , people in positions of authority , and celebrities on TV , and in the halls of Congress , in the churches and klonvocations , and on the radio , even in the middle of the night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Poky the cat knows . ( Long pause . ) Sometimes I wonder if I 'm really named Molly , and that freaks me out , because if I am not then who am I , and if I do n't have a real name what am I ? Maybe I do n't exist and this is some kind of a cruel joke your family is playing on me , and I would n't put it past them , particularly Dexter , your brother . He says he has a crush on me . But I do n't know if Dexter 's capable of such a thing , he 's such a klutz he could n't spell I.Q. if you spotted him the " Q , " and he does n't know much of anything , any more than I do . I know that for a fact . p. 31 JUDY Who the fuck do you think you are , you fucking meatball ? Just look at you ! What have you ever done to justify your existence , furface ? What makes you think you 're so hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the most important , because it 's real hard not to know anything unless you are perfectly sincere about it . JUDY Sorry . MOLLY Judy . JUDY Yes . What is it ? MOLLY What if , maybe , I only think I 'm Molly and that in fact I 'm Judy and you 're Molly and that somehow we got all mixed up , tragically , walking back from school , and Judy ( A furry pause . ) Fuck you , I am bigger than you , and I can whip your furry ass any time I want . I am smarter than you , a better bowler , and will take you on any time at blackjack , craps , or Chinese checkers . I am a better dancer , am more better in bed , a flashier dresser , and have more best-looking shoes than you . I got more important stuff on my mind than you and do not waste my breath on what is common and low class . My friends are more interesting than your friends , and they are more fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more better neighborhood , and your house is a wreck and poorly furnished and I would walk right by without saying hello if it were not for wanting to do you a favor on account of you being such a miserable , washed-up , jerk off , has-been , pathetic loser , and that 's a fact . I got more money than you , and have heaped up more valuables , foodstuffs , and loot . My wine cellars overflow with highclass swill , and I got whole warehouses of stuff , pretty damn hifalutin ' type stuff , stuff the likes of which you never laid eyes on owing to your lack of class , and general cussidness . And what 's more I speak my mind more better than you because God loves me and mine better than you and yours and no wonder ! Because , like , I mean , you ever take a good close look at yourself , man ? why , you are ugly , and when I say ugly I mean your kind of ugly gives whole new meaning to the higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am superior to you in all other respects , and if I have a fault it is that I have lowered myself somewhat by even bothering to associate with such as yourself , someone whose sense of self-esteem lies buried somewhere , somewhere remote , buried butt-up beyond the barbed wire and towers of redemption . A total dickhead . ( Pause . The girls look surprised by their little episode of unpleasantness. ) p. 32 MOLLY Judy , I think there 's something the matter with you . JUDY I think there 's something strange going on . Something strange is trying to take over Hillsbottom . MOLLY But how could that be ? JUDY We 're good people . Good people should n't be talking like this . Good people should talk normal . Good people should act sincere . MOLLY Judy , I 'm afraid . JUDY Something bad 's gotten into us . MOLLY You have to have faith . JUDY Faith . ( She looks stunned . ) Yeah . MOLLY Judy , I just had a bad thought . JUDY I had a bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as before . Same old moon , but strange . Bigger and mean-looking . The girl and boy of the first love scene , GEORGE and JUDY , sit in car . They do n't feel so hot . CHRIST observes them from the tall weeds , hidden . MELVIN , MOLLY , and TOM , unseen by audience , hide in car . JUDY I do n't feel so hot . GEORGE Neither do I. JUDY I do n't feel so hot , and I think it 's your fault . ( A nasty pause . They get out of the car . ) GEORGE It 's not my fault , Judy . You 're just pissed because I remind you of Melvin , your previous , jerky , boyfriend . Melvin , who was a total toad , if you ask me , but we are n't the same . * ( JUDY overlaps . ) I am a normal , sweet , good-looking , small-town-type American guy , whereas this Melvin is a true goon , a desperate loser , the kind you would n't trust to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go and do something weird , ** ( MELVIN overlaps ) something uncoordinated , and not put the nuts on right , him being a somewhat alien type of fellow , the artistic type , a member of the glee club , if you get what I mean , a real limp wrist of the first water , and not like me . ( MELVIN climbs up out of the car , and goes after GEORGE . MOLLY climbs out after him. ) p. 34 JUDY No , no , no , you got it all wrong , and if I have to explain myself then clearly we have been proceeding along the foggy road of illusion , and there is an absence of trust . And how dare you bring up Melvin , who was kind enough to listen patiently to me when I had my crisis of faith , you probably forget , when Dad kept asking me to dance at the Prom , embarrassing me , us all , so that we had to ask the authorities to take him away to the asylum because of his sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and kept jitter-bugging with Molly , who you know full well was my best friend , and this when I had my eye on you , and you had your eye on me , at least that 's what you said when we got lavaliered two days later , and you took certain liberties , so that I had to admit some fairly unpleasant details of my personal life at confession and Father Greenblast was clearly shocked because he had never heard of such things being done at such a young age , in full knowledge of sin , death , and perpetuity , upon the body of one such as me , innocent , by one such as you , George , clearly a boy of too much experience to say he was normal . So when I lost my faith , that was a premonition of now , and now my soap bubble of hope is burst thanks to you , thanks George , thank you so much . ( She sits down and cries . ) MELVIN Well , I am John Q. Fedup , and if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snobs , conceited assholes and , yes , Judy I admit I had this powerful crush on you and , no , I did n't expect nothing from you but you could 've , you know , just had the courtesy to return my call , ' cause I know your mom was lying through her teeth when she said you were out , at hockey practice . I mean , I tried being nice , even though it was your Uncle Sedgewick who fired my dad  --  betcha do n't even know that !  --  at the vee-belt factory in Horsedark , near the county morgue , and that was the beginning of the end for him , he took to drugs and banjo playing with Mrs. Whatshername , the second grade teacher at Horsedark School . I never forgot that , how one of you people did that to one of my people , and it galled me . It heaped me . It 's worked me up into a fierce , semicramped state , and my heart wants to barf and blow up . ( Pause . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you start up with this faggot George creep , this cross-eyed , greasy , Asiatic mongrel , why , his people lived in yurts when my great uncle Williamson Hartbuckle played left guard on the same team as Red Knuckles . Why , he 's such a loser he do n't even know who Big Red Knuckles is , nor what he done , nor where he growed up , nor what sport he played , nor what his records are , nor which of them are still standing , nor what became of him after the sad accident , nor what his number is that was retired last year in a ceremony up in Horsedark. p. 35 MOLLY How dare you insult me , you whorish slut , who I thought was friend to me when that was clearly an Easter Bunny of mistruth ? Do you have moisture on the brain or a growth on the organ of your human reason ? You seduced George from me , the turkey , even before we began going out , and you did this out of bitterness and rancor against me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , old Aryan stock , and of Eldbended the longbow with the best , in the Black Forest with Hermann and Wolfius and their blond beasts , and our men stand over six feet tall and our genes are strong , like our white , gnashing teeth . ( Pause . ) And if we do not dance the hokey-pokey it is because we despise the hokeypokey and all things common . For we are strong . And furthermore we are more sincere than you , less afflicted with bad thoughts of sex , crime , embezzlement , and bank robbery Thank God . ( She stands , fiercely . Pause . All are suddenly still . All start up together . Loud . ) JUDY What a miserable creep you are , Melvin , * , ** ( GEORGE and MOLLY are overlapping ) to bring up this insulting garbage , and who cares what you feel , you and your swinish , low-class family . Why , if I had my way there would be local legislation passed forbidding you and your swinish family from ever spreading your alien @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a humble , modest people and we do not nose our normal , modest , American noses into other people 's lives unless there is the threat of alien contagion , as in your case , which was only prompted by your alien nosing into our ways , which have always been prompted only by the spiritual promptings of our lives , spiritual lives which are far too delicate and intellectually sophisticated for your carnal lips , brains , and feral understandings . You are of the tribe of Belial and Abaddon and must be taught the rule of law . We have tried to teach you this rule of law , but to no avail . You even have spoiled our night of love , here under the magic influence of the summer moon , because you can not leave be , but must always be tampering with the divine economy of the world , which rules all things , and compels George and me to this spot , to observe our ancient prelapsarian rites , under the furry mantle of heaven . Spite thee , devil ! Get thee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Molly , Molly , for Christ 's sake , hear me , I too am of Wotan 's mighty crew . Why , therefore , would you not have me when you might 've , out back behind the hot dog stand , after we , the Hillsbottom Huns trounced the team from Isle of Hogs , and I could see in your eyes what you wanted , yes , even as your lips denied me , and we were removed from Grace , and expelled into the desert of unsatisfaction and cultural wobble . This , wobbly-legged with lust and lack of satiety , even as the cool night beckoned . ( Pause . ) And then you start up with that miserable , slick Norton guy , what a slick , jive-ass he was , no class at all . I mean , what 'd he have that I did n't ; he did n't have no red Camaro , and he talked funny too , like some abject weirdo from out of state , some abject , suspect , reform school retard from outer space , who did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean , not a clue . And what the fuck do you want me to do ? Wait till the end of time till you put out ? I mean , like get serious . ( Pause . ) And Judy , you ask . She was strictly a party-time girl , yes , I confess it , which is why I asked her to go out , even though she is beneath me . Hell , we all know how beneath me she is ! So I guess you could say I was dealing with this crippling emotional affliction ( which you caused incidentally ) , and so where was I to turn , but this scag , Judy , the truly scaggiest of the scaggy . But to her credit she was not too proud , she was not too proud to boff me . Yes , Molly , she boffed me after gym practice , repeatedly , and in the custodian 's room during the junior prom , and at the mall , in a dark place , off-limits , near the miniature golf course , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , at our house ; and , Molly , I think God would approve this boffing because even though Judy is a dirty , scaggy slut she is sincere , which is more than I can say for you , Molly , yes , you who gave me a hurt that will not heal . Ever . p. 37 MOLLY Wotan protect me from this horde of vicious , hellish , monsterific bipeds in sheep 's clothing . May Wotan protect me from these creepy dickheads.May Wotan bury his steel hatchet in their faces.May Wotan fry them in his black skillet.May Wotan howl over their broken limbs.May Wotan stretch them up the rack , over the white-hot coals.May Wotan rip their impious eyes from their ugly heads.May He chant the sacred mystic syllables of our tribe.May He prepare oils and greases for the holy jamboree.May He rattle chains and swing the war club to terrify their ancestral spirits.May He rout their armies and scatter the fleeing.May He show no mercy when it comes to extermination.May His revenge be relentless and exacting.May He darken the skies with smoke of their burning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dead.May He melt what is solid.May He avenge the bad thought.May He stomp and groan , horribly.May He roar.May He piss on their dreams.May He shut his eyes.May he ( pause ) May He do what he must do.May he fuck them in the head till they die . Amen . ( A furry pause . TOM appears from out of the car. ) p. 38 TOM Well , that 's it . I guess none of you are really my friends after all . I plumb well knowed and misknowed all along , yup , cause if'n I were wrong you all woulda been more kindly roundabout here like most , and not up and be all so goshdarn high and mighty ' cause I never done a bad thing to none of you either and if the good Lord would hear me He would take you all up with one hand and fling you down with the other , and stomp on you good with him big furry feet , splat like that , till you were all one big red splotch , ' cause none of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
