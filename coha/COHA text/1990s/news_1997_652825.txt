<p> " A FAREWELL TO ARMS , " Ernest Hemingway 's masterpiece about a doomed World War I romance , is one of American literature 's most enduring classics . Since it was first published in 1929 , it has sold steadily , even during the 60 's , after the author 's death , when his literary fascination with violence caused his other works ' popularity to drop . <p> Scholars have long known that the novel was based in part on Hemingway 's romance with Agnes von Kurowsky , a pretty , coquettish American nurse whom he met after being wounded on the Italian front while working as a volunteer for the American Red Cross . At 26 , von Kurowsky was seven years older than Hemingway . Still , Hemingway had hoped to marry her . He was devastated when she rejected him after the war , addressing him as " kid " in a Dear John letter and saying she was fond of him " more as a mother than a sweetheart . " <p> The effect of the relationship on Hemingway 's life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the wartime romance , however , remain obscured , primarily by the differing accounts of the two lovers . In later years , von Kurowsky insisted it had been an innocent flirtation , while Hemingway maintained they 'd had a sexual affair . <p> Now a new movie , " In Love and War , " which opened on Friday , claims to reveal the true story . This $40 million soap opera is not likely to resolve the mystery , but it does prove that the Hemingway myth is alive and well . Directed by Richard Attenborough and starring Chris O'Donnell as Hemingway and Sandra Bullock as von Kurowsky , it 's based on the nurse 's World War I diary and letters , extraordinary documents that came into the film maker 's hands by a turn of fate . <p> The fact that the movie got made at all is due to the producer Dimitri Villard 's father , Henry Serrano Villard , who befriended Hemingway and von Kurowsky during World War I. Like Hemingway , Villard was a volunteer for the Red Cross ambulance service and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kurowsky was posted . At the time , his father was unaware of " Ag and Ernie 's " attachment , says Dimitri Villard , though " he once saw them holding hands " in a way that suggested " Agnes was n't taking Hemingway 's pulse . " <p> Villard lost touch with the couple after the war . Then , in 1961 , soon after Hemingway 's suicide , Carlos Baker , the writer 's biographer , contacted Villard and gave him von Kurowsky 's address . He corresponded with the former nurse , who was now married and living in Key West , Fla. , where Hemingway also had lived . <p> Later , at von Kurowsky 's urging , Villard used his influence as a former American ambassador ( to Libya , Senegal and Mauritania ) to win permission for her to buried at the National Cemetery in Arlington , Va . After her death at 92 in 1984 , her husband , in gratitude , sent her diary and letters to Villard " out of the blue one day , " says his son . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James Nagel , a Hemingway expert who teaches literature at the University of Georgia , published the material in a 1989 book , " Hemingway in Love and War . " In a pain stakingly-researched essay , Nagel wrote that von Kurowsky returned home a virgin . But in the film , the couple consummate their affair at a flophouse on the Italian front . As they undress and fall into an embrace , a dreamy Italian melody wafts through the open window mixed with chatter of prostitutes . " Oh , Aggie , it was n't supposed to be like this . We were going to be in the most beautiful place on God 's earth , " says Mr. O'Donnell 's character . " Never mind . . . close your eyes , " his nurse whispers back . <p> This sentimental scene has no basis in fact , though Dimitri Villard says it 's in the " spirit " of the truth ; he is convinced that the couple consummated their love . " Agnes 's letters are so passionate it 's hard to believe there was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Kid , my kid , " von Kurowsky wrote Hemingway on Sept. 25 , 1918 . " I 've just been in your room , and talk about chairs that whisper ! That whole room haunted me so that I could not stay in it . " And on Oct. 17 , she wrote , " I guess every girl likes to have some man tell her . . . he ca n't do without her . Anyway , I am but human , and when you say these things I love it and ca n't help but believe you so do n't be afraid I 'll get tired of you . I have n't really started to worry yet over your forgetting to love me as you do now . " <p> But these musings  --  written after the two were separated first by a trip he took to Stresa , then by her transfer to a hospital in Florence  --  are in sharp contrast to the tart entries in her diary written not long before . <p> " Now Ernest Hemingway has a crush on me or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And in other typical passages , she wrote , " Ernest Hemingway . . . is far too fond of me and speaks in such a desperate way every time I am cool , that I dare not damper his ardor as long as he is here in the hospital . Poor kid , I am sorry for him . " <p> Still , the idea of a torrid affair between the teen-ager from Oak Park , Ill. , and the shapely auburn-haired nurse , fits the myth of Hemingway as an icon of male prowess  --  hunter , drinker , fighter , writer and lover . Perhaps that 's why the myth of the affair persists in the mostly male world of Hemingway scholarship , and why it has led to some outlandish speculation . In his 1987 biography , " Hemingway , " Kenneth S. Lynn , then a professor at Johns Hopkins University , described in detail the couple 's lovemaking , even the position they preferred . <p> The known facts , however , suggest that the romance was entirely innocent . Indeed , the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was found by another nurse under Hemingway 's pillow . And , of course , the writer 's own boasting in letters to friends . But , as Mr. Nagel points out about Hemingway 's correspondence , " there 's a long series of letters during this period that we know to be phony , " in the sense that Hemingway bragged or embellished the truth . One letter , for instance , announced his engagement to Mae Marsh , the once-celebrated but now-forgotten silent film star . <p> Von Kurowsky herself denied having slept with Hemingway . " Let 's get it straight  --  please , " she told Henry S. Villard , " I was n't that kind of girl . " <p> But in fact what happened is less important than the emotional aftermath of the experience for Hemingway  --  the effect it had on his relationships with women and the portrayal of women in his fiction . <p> The film 's love scenes may not be historically accurate , but they capture what Mr. Attenborough says is a mood of emotional intensity , and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do you think if they 'd gotten married and had children that he would have been the same writer ? " Mr. Attenborough asks . " Do you think the anger and frustration and humiliation he suffered in his belly for so many years in regard to being turned down , which drove him and fired him , would still be there ? " <p> Perhaps not . It 's clear Hemingway continued throughout his life to draw on von Kurowsky in creating his heroines . The book von Kurowsky is best known for inspiring is " A Farewell to Arms . " As anyone who has taken a college literature course ( or seen the 1932 movie starring Gary Cooper and Helen Hayes , or the less interesting 1957 movie with Rock Hudson and Jennifer Jones ) knows , it tells the tragic love story of Catherine Barkley , an alluring British nurse , and Frederic Henry , an American lieutenant in the Italian Army , who deserts his unit . The war setting and the lovers ' occupations draw on Hemingway 's experience but there are vast differences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Catherine dies after giving birth to a stillborn son . <p> Before making the movie , Mr. Attenborough asked Mr. O'Donnell and Ms. Bullock not to read " A Farewell to Arms " because he did n't want their portrayals to be influenced by Hemingway 's fictional characters . Von Kurowsky 's diary reveals her to be stalwart , somewhat insensitive and emotionally reserved . In contrast , Catherine Barkley , like most of Hemingway 's heroines , is romantic and wounded , damaged by life in some fundamental way and desperate to escape her unhappy past through love . In this sense , she more closely resembles Hemingway 's first two wives , the sensitive Hadley Richardson and the passionate Pauline Pfeiffer . ( He wrote the book while married to Pfeiffer . ) <p> Still , von Kurowsky was Hemingway 's first love and her rejection triggered his literary preoccupation with romantic loss . In book after book and story after story , lovers are separated by misunderstandings , cooled passions , insanity and death . <p> Or , as in " In Love and War , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still a part of me that wants to take you in my arms . . . but I 've changed . . . it would n't work , " Hemingway tells von Kurowsky when she tracks him down at his parents ' cottage in Michigan at the end of Mr. Attenborough 's movie . In truth , the couple never saw each other after they left Italy in 1918 . <p> " In a movie you have to make compromises , " says Mr. Nagel , who was a consultant on the screenplay . " When they called me and said , ' We think we have to bring them together again , ' it made sense to me . It 's unsatisfactory for them not to see each other again , for the romance to simply fritter away . " <p> At least , he adds , " they did n't make it a happy ending . "
