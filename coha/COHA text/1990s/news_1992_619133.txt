<p> An IPO a day keeps the bears away . <p> That 's what investors , companies thirsting to go public and their underwriters seemed to think last year , when 360 initial public offerings  --  almost one per day  --  hit the stock market , raising a near-record $ 16.4 billion ( excluding closed-end funds ) . <p> Bullish investors pushed the New Issues Index , a rolling index of stocks in their first six months of trading , up an astonishing 106.4 percent last year . The Standard &; Poor 's 500 index gained 26.3 percent . <p> In 1990 , when the IPO market ground to a halt during the fourth quarter as America prepared for war , only 174 companies went public , raising just $ 4.6 billion ( excluding closed-end funds ) . And the New Issues Index , tracked by Standard &; Poor 's , fell 11.1 percent . <p> In Northern California last year , 29 companies raised a total of $ 795.5 million in IPOs , and by year-end the average offering was 48 percent above its initial price , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13 Northern California companies raised $ 456 million . Their stocks gained 4.5 percent by the end of 1990 . <p> IPO volume swelled last year for several reasons : <p> * Pent-up demand from late 1990 was released . <p> * Falling interest rates led investors to favor stocks over bonds . <p> * The market as a whole became favorably disposed to small , fast-growing companies . Most IPOs fit  --  or purport to fit  --  that description . <p> For IPO investors , 1991 " was an exception to the rule , " said Robert Natale , a vice president of equity research with S &P.; <p> In most years , IPOs are heavily courted for three months or so , then dumped when the next hot new thing comes along . <p> Last year , however , " many investment themes that were popular in the beginning of the year remained popular throughout the year , " Natale said . <p> Those voted most-likely-to-succeed were health care  --  especially biotechnology and medical technology IPOs  --  and " reverse-LBOs , " or companies that had gone private via @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Natale said that the average biotech IPO doubled last year . In Northern California , eight biotech IPOs posted an average gain of 94 percent . The biggest winner of this group was Systemix , which developed a mouse with a human immune system and saw its stock price triple . The only loser was GeneLabs Technologies , which ended the year 1 percent below its IPO price . <p> " One investment strategy that did n't work very well , " Natale said , " was retail stocks , " especially those offering high-end goods . A number of retail companies went public in the spring , when investors were anticipating an economic recovery . When the recovery was aborted , many retail IPOs plunged . <p> Upscale clothier Ann Taylor , for example , ended the year 42 percent below its offering price . But Filene 's Basement , Boston 's bargain- hunters ' heaven , rose 30 percent . Both deals were co-managed by San Francisco 's Robertson , Stephens . <p> Locally , the only two consumer- oriented IPOs  --  Supercuts , a discount haircut chain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priced shoes and apparel  --  were up 49 percent and 36 percent respectively . <p> The IPO market is expected to remain red-hot , at least during the first quarter of this year ; 105 companies have filed to go public this month , IDD reports . <p> Natale figures that health-care IPOs will remain vibrant during the first few months , followed by " first- stage recovery stocks , " such as retail and entertainment . Late this year or early next , if the economy picks up , stocks in cyclical industries such as steel , chemical and paper should do well . <p> IPO watchers warn , however , that investors will be less likely than they were in 1991 to stick with any one IPO for more than a quarter or two . And they point out that whenever the IPO market gets frothy , some lesser-quality deals will bubble up . <p> Robert Mescal , a research analyst with " New Issues " newsletter , said that investors should read IPO prospectuses carefully , paying particular attention to the following items : <p> * Where are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see how many of the shares are being sold by the company itself and how many by existing shareholders . If most are coming from shareholders , there wo n't be much left for the company to reinvest . <p> * What will the proceeds be used for ? If the company plans to build plants , establish a sales organization , bolster working capital or otherwise expand the business , " that would make the company pretty viable , " Mescal said . If much of the money is going to reduce debt , " then it wo n't be any better as a public company than it was private . " <p> * Who is going to run it ? Check on management 's credentials and background . <p> * What are their salaries ? Are they reasonable , " or is management trying to milk the company , " Mescal asks . He would rather see management take a smaller salary and stock options than a lot of money up- front . <p> * Is the company unique ? If the company is in a hot new industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's in a crowded or timeworn industry , then it better have something exceedingly new and different . <p> NORTHERN CALIFORNIA PUBLIC OFFERINGS <p> * Biggest winner in 1991 : Systemix , up 204 percent <p> * Biggest loser : Citation Insurance , down 45 percent <p> * Biggest deal : Atmel raised $ 58.5 million <p> CHART : NORTHERN CALIFORNIA 'S 1991 IPOS : HOW THEY FARED In chronological order **29;711;TOOLONG OFFERING DOLLARS YEAREND % INCREASE DATE ( IN MILLIONS ) IPO PRICE PRICE ( DECREASE ) UNDERWRITER ( x ) Cygnus Therapeutic Systems/ Biotech/Redwood City 1/31 $27 $9 $22 3/4 153 RS Zilog/ Semiconductors/Campbell 2/27 22 11 20 1/4 84 AB Atmel/ Semiconductors/San Jose 3/19 58.5 13 8 7/8 ( 32 ) AB Take Care/ HMO/Concord 3/20 47.5 19 19 1/2 3 FB Citation Insurance Group/ Workers compensation insurance/ San Jose 3/21 17 9 1/2 5 1/4 ( 45 ) KP Sierra Semiconductor/ Integrated Circuits/San Jose 4/24 32 16 19 1/4 20 MS Ross Systems/ Computersoftware/Redwood City 4/25 27.5 10 12 1/4 22 DLJ Applied Immune Sciences/ Biotech/Menlo Park 5/2 31 12 23 1/2 96 MONT GeneLabs Technologies/ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allen Glycomed/ Biotech/Alameda 6/13 16 7 17 1/2 150 H &Q; Cor Therapeutics/ Biotech/San Francisco 6/27 15 7 1/2 15 100 RS American Biodyne/ Mental health care programs San Francisco 7/12 14 10 17 70 DW Micronics Computers/ PC circuit boards/Fremont 7/17 18 6 8 1/4 38 PW Teknekron Comm .
