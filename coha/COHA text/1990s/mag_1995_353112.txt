The giveaway was the yellow diplomatic license plate with the number 64 : it announced that the white Toyota Hiace van , making its morning run along Karachi 's Shara-e-Faisal Boulevard , was registered to the U.S. consulate . At a red light , two men jumped out of a stolen taxi , and as one stood watch , another fired at the van with an AK-47 rifle . Sixteen gunshots later , Gary C. Durell , 45 , a CIA communications technician , was dead , and Jackie Van Landingham , 33 , a consulate secretary , was fatally wounded . A third employee , postal clerk Marc McCloy , 31 , was shot in the ankle . The gunmen spared the Pakistani driver and sped away . Said a stunned Karachi resident , Mohammad Ismail Said , an office clerk : " The barbarians have arrived . " <P> In fact , the barbarians are well established in Karachi , Pakistan 's biggest city ( pop . 10 million ) . The town is torn by conflict between rival factions of Mohajir Muslim migrants from India @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benazir Bhutto , and between rival groups of Sunni and Shi'ite Muslims . Add to that a booming heroin trade , a kidnap-for-ransom industry and a mountain of weapons left over from the 1979-89 Afghanistan war . The result : 1,200 murders in the past year , making Karachi one of the deadliest cities in the world . ( In New York City , where 7.5 million live , 1,600 people were murdered last year . ) " You 've got people with all kinds of reasons to kill each other , " says a State Department official in Washington . " And they are merrily going about it . " <P> The killings of the consular workers were the first in recent memory that both involved foreigners in Karachi and were not connected directly with crime or sectarian strife . That led some diplomats in Karachi to speculate that the attackers were Islamic militants angry at Pakistan 's extradition to the U.S. in February of Ramsi Yousef , suspected mastermind of New York City 's 1993 World Trade Center bombing . Others suggest it may have been a deliberate attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was directly fired upon . Van Landingham died because she was sitting beside Durell and came in the line of fire . Yet another theory is that Prime Minister Bhutto 's Mohajir opponents may have planned the killings to disrupt a recent warming in U.S.-Pakistani relations : the Prime Minister will visit Washington next month , and Hillary and Chelsea Clinton are expected to arrive in Pakistan-though not in Karachi-on March 26 at the beginning of a 10-day Asian trip . <P> The U.S. sent security experts and FBI agents to Karachi to gather evidence and offered a $2 million reward for help in finding the killers , unlikely as that is . " It could be anybody , " says a U.S. intelligence official in Washington . The only certainty is that the Americans made very easy targets . Unlike U.S.-owned vehicles in other trouble spots around the globe , the van did not have armor plating or bulletproof glass , it appeared to follow the same route every morning , and the driver was not trained in ambush-escape techniques . " These folks did n't need to die like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department counterterrorism official who now heads a security consulting firm . " This was avoidable .
