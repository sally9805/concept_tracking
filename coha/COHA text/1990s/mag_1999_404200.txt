From left : Chvonne Hill , Christen James , Tiffany Gathers , Lorena Parrish , Khadijah Salaam and Monique Hill celebrate sister power . // FOURTEEN-YEAR-OLD CHRISTEN JAMES had a rough time last year . Her world almost crumbled as illness struck beloved members of her family . Her grandmother developed Alzheimer 's disease ; next her grandfather discovered he had prostate cancer along with heart disease and chronic arthritis ; and her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent a major operation . To say Christen was scared would be putting it mildly Partly because of her involvement in an organized mentorship program called S.O.S. ( Save Our Selves ) , she was able to navigate resolutely through those difficult times . " Everyone says that God never throws anything your way in life without knowing you can handle it , " says Christen , a Bronx , New York , resident . " And now I know this is true . " Crises like Christen 's may be the exception rather than the rule , but most of us would agree that the teen years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair , weight , friends , future and , oh yes , relationships with boys , while undergoing great physical and emotional changes . Nothing is as it seems . Questions abound about what a woman is or is n't , who she can or ca n't be . For some young women , particularly in our urban communities , the teen years bring additional problems-drugs , abuse , poverty and a crabs-in-a-barrel mentality that threatens to lower rather than raise expectations . It 's no surprise that with those kinds of challenges , teens often find it hard to know which way is up-much less how they can get there . Which is precisely where programs like S.O.S. come in . Can We Talk ? Riverside Church , located in New York City 's Morningside Heights community , is home to the S.O.S. program . In a secluded room with comfy oversize couches , girls and women gather every Friday night from November to May for heated discussions on topics such as sexuality and spirituality , fitness and nutrition , love , dating , friendship and selfrespect . Through workshops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selfesteem , enhance their family relationships and take responsibility for their education and lives . Although the program has existed for only two years , its impact on girls like Christen has been profound . " We learn to say what we really feel in S.O.S. , " notes Christen , who hopes to study music at Juilliard . " I do n't have to worry about people being disappointed in what I say or judging it . I can just say it . " " I was n't too good in school ; I did n't even go last year . I 'm kind of a bad girl , " admits Ebony Cochran , 15 . " But I see these girls in the group on the honor roll and going away on trips and I think , Maybe I can do that , too . " Six mentors and the program 's founder , Lorena Parrishmainly members of Riverside Church-volunteer their time to role-play and lead spirited discussions . " We believe , " Parrish says , " that if we can learn to better support our girls on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world a better place . " To recruit her mentors , Parrish reached out to sisters who 'd already shown sensitivity toward girls ' needs , as well as to local groups like Community Board 9 's Office of Youth Activities . The mentors then completed a fourweek training program that , among other things , schooled them on how they could encourage girls to be advocates of change . Now mentors meet once a month to assess how the program is going . Photograph At right : Emmanuella , Khadijah , Ebony . Below : Aminah and Corinne Nelson . // This agenda covers many bases . Sleep-overs at the church give mentors and their charges more time to fully explore subjects , such as sexuality , that are too explosive to handle during regular conferences . Field trips to fun and fascinating places-a day spa , Spelman College-give the girls a sense of what 's out there in the world . And when high-profile women visit to share their stories at a career-day conference , the young women get a glimpse of what their futures might hold . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included-to revel in just being a girl . Girl Power ! Parrish moves through her busy days with flying braids and a peaceful smile . Five years ago she was earning close to a six-figure salary in publishing . But though she felt fairly settled in her day-to-day existence , something gnawed at her . " I began to feel like it was n't enough , " Parrish reflects in her office overlooking Claremont Avenue . " I heard the Spirit tell me my life is supposed to go down a certain path and that the road included girls and the church . It was quite frightening , especially because I was so comfortable . But I felt like there was a big void in my life . Like something was missing . " Still , she feared that working in the community would mean financial struggle and even more stress in her life . And as for the church-well , she 'd never really had a close relationship with the Lord 's house . Growing up in East New York , Brooklyn , Parrish was active in the church but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from it entirely , she reasoned that maybe she could transform it from within . So in 1993 , at 34 , Parrish entered Columbia University 's Union Theological Seminary . She has a dual master 's degree in social work and divinity and is finishing her Ph.D . in systematic theology . " I decided church is a unique way to deal with the world , a perfect place for us to gather our strength , " she says . Parrish focused her efforts on Riverside Church largely because it is located across the street from Union Theological Seminary and has an extensive youth ministry . Since the 1950 's Riverside has held a weekly youth fellowship where kids in the neighborhood can shoot hoops , play pool , receive tutoring , watch movies , talk and keep out of trouble . The program , which often attracted 60 or so boys each night , drew few girls . Parrish decided to hold focus groups with the girls who did venture out , and , with their parents , determine what kind of program they really needed . Based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forum through which girls can learn the value in being female . The first 14 girls chosen for the program came from Manhattan , Staten Island , Queens and New Jersey , and from different religious backgrounds , including Christianity and Islam . Parrish , now a full-time employee of the church , stresses that although S.O.S. is not about religion , it " celebrates our girls as gifts from God and affirms that they can set their sights high and achieve the goals they set . " At a time when their minds and ideas are constantly being invalidated , girls often feel powerless and voiceless-but not in the comfort of Riverside 's walls on Friday nights . Three of five girls in this year 's program were also in last year 's . " I used to be afraid to speak out , and I learned last year that I have low selfesteem , " says Aminah Salaam , 14 . " But I have also learned to say what I mean . " Adds her 16-year-old cousin and best friend , Monique Hill , " You can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're not alone in anything . " Rules that Parrish developed help build a safe listening space and a foundation of trust and respect . Handwritten on a big sheet of paper and mounted on the wall , these guidelines read like snippets from a Lifesprings or Landmark education course ( selfhelp groups for grown-ups ) : eNo put-downs of yourself or others . c Only one person talks at a time . * 1ctive listening is encouraged when others talk . * 1ell your own story , not others ' ' . Using these rules , S.O.S. has helped the girls grow in ways they might not have thought possible . " I want to have a powerful impact on the world , " says 18-year-old poet and rapper Emmanuella Mathurin , a freshman at John Jay College and now in her second year with the S.O.S. program . " I was afraid to go to college last year . My friend had just died in a car crash , and I was scared about my own life . But I learned that somehow you got ta make life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take control and be your own individual . " Photograph S.O.S. founder Lorena Parrish with LeBaron Taylor of Sony Records , a program supporter . // And what other lessons have helped these girls get through their biggest challenges ? Aminah : " That there are people who care about you and who will help you through your problems . " Monique : " You do n't have to smoke weed or drink on the corner . " Christen : " You do n't have to be like everyone else . " Emmanuella : " I do n't need men to survive . " Ebony : " Do n't judge people by the way they look . " Tiffany Gathers : " You have to use your inner strength to grow . " The program culminates in a recognition ceremony in which friends and family , church members and the larger community come out to celebrate the girls ' achievements . As Aminah sums it up , " If people tell kids we are great , our selfesteem will grow .
