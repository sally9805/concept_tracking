In her first novel since the Pulitzer-prizewinning The Stone Diaries ( 1995 ) , Carol Shields takes on the burden of eliciting interest in a rather unprepossessing hero . Larry 's Party ( Viking ; 339 pages ; $23.95 ) offers 15 chapters , each of which has the stand-alone feel of a short story , excerpting details from the imagined life of one Larry Weller . <P> There he is at 26 , in 1977 , a floral designer in Winnipeg , Canada , living with his parents and happy in his job . Then he marries Dorrie and buys a house . They have a son they name Ryan , but their marriage breaks up after five years . Unexpectedly , Larry becomes prominent and well paid for designing and planting hedge mazes , an interest he developed during his honeymoon in England with Dorrie . He meets and marries Beth , an aspiring academic who later leaves him and their marriage for a prestigious post in London . In 1996 , Larry falls into a coma for 22 days but recovers fully . A year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which , a tad improbably , both of Larry 's ex-wives wind up being invited . <P> Save , perhaps , for the title character 's coma , Larry 's Party would seem to offer readers an experience about as exciting as watching shrubs grow . But Shields demonstrates that doing just that can be fascinating if seen through the speeded-up , time-lapse frames of her narrative . Larry develops from " a dreamy kid " into a grown man who feels that " he 's been dozing off again . " Life has pruned him for good and ill but not altered his essential stock . His passive nature , his curiosity about what will happen to him next , does not form the raw material for high drama . But in him , Shields captures an unremarkable man in a remarkable light . <P>  --  By Paul Gray
