Mama warned me , stay away from white girls . Once I did n't . So , thirty years too late I 'm minding my mama . That 's how it happened . <p> I saw her . Flurries that night and she 's running , bare-legged , wearing almost nothing at all , and the snow 's rising up in funnels , like ghosts , spinning across the street till they whip themselves against the bricks , and I 'm thinking , Crazy white girl do n't know enough to come in from the cold . <p> Crackhead most likely , not feeling the wind . I 'd seen the abandoned car at the end of the block , ten days now , shooting gallery on wheels , going nowhere . One of them , I told myself , pissed at her boyfriend or so high she thinks her skin is burning off her . Most times crackheads do n't know where they are . Like last week . Girl comes pounding on my door . White girl . Could 've been the same one . Says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him last night . And I say , Lenny ai n't here ; and she says , Let me in . I do n't like arguing with a white girl in my hallway so I let her in . I say , Look around . She says , Shit  --  this is n't even the right place . She says , What 're you tryin ' to pull here , buddy ? And I back away , I say , Get out of here . I say , I do n't want no trouble ; and she says , Damn straight you do n't want no trouble . Then she 's gone but I 'm thinking : You can be in it that fast and it 's nothing you did it 's just something that happens . <p> See , I 've already done my time . Walpole , nine years . And I 'm not saying Rita 's the only reason I went down , but I 'm telling you , the time would n't have been so hard if not for the white girl . <p> Cold turkey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clinic , sipping methadone and orange juice . I 'm on the floor , my whole body twisted , trying to strangle itself  --  bowels wrung like rags , squeezed dry , ribs clamped down on lungs so I ca n't breathe , my heart a fist , beating itself . And I think I 'm screaming ; I must be screaming , and my skin 's on fire , but nobody comes , and nobody brings water , and I want to be dead and out of my skin . <p> Then I 'm cold , shaking so hard I think my bones will break , and that 's when the rabbitman slips in between the bars . The rabbitman says : Once an axe flew off its handle , split an overseer 's skull , cleaved it clean , and I saw how easily the body opens , how gladly gives itself up ; I saw how the coil of a man 's brains spill from his head  --  even as his mouth opens , even as he tries to speak . Then I saw a blue shadow of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran out of his own skin and they never found him , the rabbitman , but I tell you , they took my skin and I was still alive . Then the rabbitman whispered : I got news for you , little brother , I been talkin ' to the man and he told me , it ai n't time , yet , for this nigger to die . <p> So no , I do n't go chasing that girl in the street . I know she 'll be cold fast , but I think , Not my business  --  let one of her friends find her . <p> See , since Rita , I do n't have much sympathy for white girls . And I 'm remembering what my mama told me , and I 'm remembering the picture of that boy they pulled out of the Tallahatchie , sweet smiling boy like I was then , fourteen years old and a white girl 's picture in his wallet , so he do n't think nothing of being friendly with a white woman in a store . Then the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ring on his finger to tell his mama who he was , everything else that was his boy 's life gone : cocky grin , sleepy eyes , felt hat , his skinny-hipped way of walking , all that gone , dragged to the bottom of the river by a cotton-gin fan tied to his neck with barbed wire . Mama said she was n't trying to turn me mean but she wanted me to see  --  for my own good because she loved me , which is why she did everything  --  because she 'd die if anything happened to me  --  and I thought , even then , something was bound to happen , sooner or later , the fact of living in my black skin a crime I could n't possibly escape . I only had to look once for one second to carry him around with me the rest of my life , like a photograph in my back pocket that did n't crack or fade , that just got sharper instead , clear as glass and just as dangerous till I pulled it out one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those years . <p> I thought about that boy when I met Rita . He breathed on my neck and I laughed to make him stop . I did n't go after her . It was nothing like that . It was just something that happened  --  like the white girl pounding at my door  --  I was watching it , then I was in it . <p> We were at Wally 's , me and Leo Stokes , listening to the music , jazz  --  we liked the music . Mostly I 'm listening to the drummer thinking he do n't got it right . He thinks he 's too important . He do n't know the drums are supposed to be the sound underneath the sound . That 's why I 'm good  --  that 's why I want to play  --  I got a gift . I hear a sound below horn and piano , the one they need , like I did back in Virginia living in one room  --  Mama and Daddy , Bernice and Leroy and me , and there were lots of sounds all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one sound  --  like at night when Mama and Daddy are fighting and her voice keeps climbing higher and higher like it 's gon na break , and his is low and hard and slow , and then they 're tangled together and the words do n't make sense , but I 'm not scared  --  no matter how bad it gets  --  because I 'm listening . I hear a whippoorwill or grasshoppers , the wings of cicadas in July , a frenzy of wings rubbing , trying to wear themselves down , and I know what they want  --  I know what we all want  --  and it 's like that sound is holding everything else together , so even if Mama starts crying , and even if Daddy leaves and do n't come back till afternoon the next day , and even if they stop arguing and the other sounds start , even if Daddy has to put his hand over Mama 's mouth and say , Hush now , the children , even if they get so quiet I ca n't hear their breathing , I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cicadas are out there , and they 've been there all along , even when I did n't know I was hearing them , that one sound 's been steady , that one sound 's been holding everything tight . So I 'm listening to the music , thinking , This drummer do n't know his place . He thinks he 's got to get on top of things . And I hear Leo say , Luck or trouble , little brother , heading this way , and then she 's there , standing too close , standing above me . She 's saying , Spare a cigarette ? She 's whispering , Got a light ? And then she 's sitting down with us and she 's got her hand on my hand while I light her cigarette and I 'm thinking she 's pretty  --  in a way , in this light  --  and she 's older , so I think she knows things  --  and I ask myself what 's the harm of letting her sit here , and that 's when I laugh to make the boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Then later that night I 'm looking at my own dark hand on her thin white neck and it scares me , the difference , the color of me , the size , and she says , What color is the inside of ? our mouth , the inside of your chest ? She says , Open me  --  do I bleed , do my bones break ? She says , Kiss me , we 're the same . And I do . And we are . When we 're alone , we are . <p> She came to see me once . Cried , said she was sorry , and I sat there looking like I had stones in my stomach , ashes in my chest , like I did n't want to put my hands around her neck to touch that damp place under her hair . I told myself , She 's not so pretty anymore . She looked old . The way white women do . Too skinny . Cigarettes and sun making her skin crack . Purple marks dark as bruises under her green eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tired , you get on home . I 'm acting like I ca n't wait to get back to my cell , like I 'm looking forward to the next three thousand nights smelling nothing but my own rotten self , like I 've got some desire to spend nine years looking at the bodies of men , like I have n't already wondered how long it 's gon na be before I want them . She says she did n't know , she did n't mean to make it worse for me , and I say , Where you been living , girl ? What country ? She 's not crying then , she 's pissed . She says , You know what they did to me when I came in here ? You know where they touched me ? And I say , One day . One friggin ' hour of your life . I live here , baby . They touch me all the time . Whenever they want . Wherever . <p> I 'm not saying she stuck the needle in my arm and turned me into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Plenty of things I did I should n't have . I paid for those . Three burglaries , nine years , you figure . So yeah , I paid for a dozen crimes they never slapped on me , a hundred petty thefts . But the man do n't mind about your grandfather 's gold pocket watch ; he do n't worry when the ten-dollar bill flies out of your mama 's purse and floats into your hand . He do n't bother you much if he sees you shoving weed on your own street . But that was different . Back when I was peddling for Leo I had a purpose , doing what I had to do to get what I needed . Then things turned upside down with Rita , and I was robbing my own mama , stealing to buy the dope instead of selling it , smack instead of grass . Rita said : Just once  --  you wo n't get hooked , and it 's fine , so fine , better than the music , because it 's inside . She was right  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside : it made me forget the sound and the need . <p> Now my mama is singing me to sleep , humming near my ear , Bless the child , and I 'm waking as a man twenty-one years old , and I 'm going to Walpole till I 'm thirty . Sweet-faced Rita has scrubbed herself clean for the trial . She says it was all my idea and she was afraid , who would n't be ? Seven men see their own wives , their own daughters , and pray no man like me ever touches their pretty white things . They think they can put me away . They think locked doors and steel bars keep them safe . Five women see their own good selves and swear they 'd never do what Rita did if not by force . <p> I want to tell them how different she can be , how she looks when she 's strung out , too jittery to talk , when her jaw goes so tight the tendons pop in her neck . I want to tell them how she begged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so easy , her old neighborhood , her own people , habits she could predict , dogs she could calm . I want to ask them , Do black men drive your streets alone ? I want to tell them , I was in the back , on the floor , covered by a blanket . She drove . She waited in the car , watching you , while I broke windows , emptied jewelry boxes , hunted furs . <p> Next thing I know I 'm in prison and she 's on probation and Mama 's telling me , You got to stay alive . Ninety-two times she says it . Once a month for eight years , then one month she does n't show , and the next week Bernice comes , says Mama 's sick and are n't I ashamed . Then Mama comes again , three more times , but she 's looking yellowish , not her high yellow but some new dirty yellow that even fills her eyes . She 's not losing her weight but it 's slipping down around her in strange ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward me , she looks like a woman dragging her own body . My baby . That 's all she says . But I know the rest . Then Bernice is there again , shaking her head , telling me one more time how Mama gave up her life to give us a decent chance and she 's got reason to be proud  --  little Leroy a schoolteacher , Bernice a nurse . I mean to remind her , You feed mashed-up peas to old ladies with no teeth . You slip bedpans under wrinkled white asses . Wearing a uniform do n't make you no nurse , Bernice . But I just say , Lucky for Mama the two of you turned out so fine . I grin but Bernice is n't smiling ; Bernice is crossing her big arms over her big chest . I see her fall to her knees as if her body is folding under her . I see her face crumple as if she 's just been struck . And I 'm not in prison . I 'm free , but just barely , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , five other men like me , lifting the box and Mama in it , the light through stained glass breaking above us and that terrible wailing , the women crying but not Mama , the women singing as if they still believe in their all merciful God , as if they 've forgotten their sons : sacrificed , dead , in solitary , on the street , rotting in a jungle , needles in their arms , fans tied around their necks , as if they do n't look up at Jesus and say , What a waste . <p> I remembered my own small hands in the other white gloves ; I thought my skin would stain them . The bull was dead . I would never be washed clean . But I was , baptized and redeemed . The white robes swirled , dragged me down , blinded me , and I thought , I ca n't swim , I 'm going to die , and this is why my father would n't come to church today  --  the preacher in black is letting me die , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's necessary  --  I remember the stories my mother and I read , forbidden stories , our secret : cities crumbling , land scorched , plagues of frogs and gnats , plagues of boils and hail , seas and rivers turned to blood , and then , suddenly , I am rising and I am alive , spared by grace . The whole church trembles around me , women singing , telling Moses to let their people go , sweet low voices urging the children to wade in the water , but I know it 's too deep , too dark , and I was n't wading , I was drowning , but the voices are triumphant , the walls are tumbling down . Easter morning light blazes through colored glass ; John baptizes Jesus above the water where we are baptized . I am shivering , cold , crying . Mama is sobbing , too ; I hear her voice above the others , but I know she 's happy . I know that Jesus is alive again just as I am alive , and I have never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good forever , and I am going to love Jesus who has saved me through his suffering , and I am going to forgive my father who has forsaken me . I am high and righteous and without doubt . I am ten years old . <p> These same women are still singing about that same damn river , like this time they 're really going to cross it , when everybody knows they 're stuck here just like me and not one of us can swim ; the only river we see is thick as oil and just as black , so what 's the point of even trying when you 'd be frozen stiff in two minutes and sinking like the bag of sticks and bones you are , and still they wo n't stop swaying , as if they have no bones , as if the air is water and they are under it , and they are swimming , and they can not be drowned , as if women have a way of breathing that men do n't . I 'm choking . I look at Leroy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see if he 's gasping , remembering Mama , our love for her , our guilt , but he 's not guilty , he 's a good clean boy , a teacher , clever little Leroy making numbers split in pieces , making them all come together right again . Nothing can be lost , he says , and he believes it . I say , Did n't you ever want anything ? And he looks at me like I 'm talking shit , which I suppose I am , but I still wonder , Why did n't you feel it , that buzz in your veins , the music playing ; why did n't you ever close your eyes and forget who it was Mama told you not to touch ? Did n't we have the same blind father ? Did n't you ever wonder where Mama got her gold eyes ? Did n't the rabbitman ever fly through your open window ? <p> Twenty years now and I still want to ask my brother the same questions . Twenty years and I still want to tell our mama I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't mean a thing . I want to ask her , Do you blame me ? And I want to ask her , Should I go out in the snow ? I almost hear her answer , but I do n't go . <p> Digging graves , hauling garbage , snaking sewers  --  I 've done every filthy job , and now , two years , something halfway decent , graveyard shift but no graves . It 's good work , steady , because there are always broken windows , busted doors . Fires burst glass ; cars jump curbs ; bullets tear through locks ; police crack wood  --  always  --  so I do n't have to worry , and Mama would be proud . <p> I 'm alone with it , boards and nails , the hammer pounding . I strike straight , hold the place in my mind , like Daddy said . It 's winter . My bare hands split at the knuckles , my bare hands bleed in the cold . Wind burns my ears but I do n't mind . I do n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman . I know how desires come , one hooked to the other , and I 'm glad my heart is a fist , shattered on a prison wall , so I do n't have to think I might still play  --  because I ca n't , and it 's not just the bones broken . But sometimes I hear the sound underneath the sound : it 's summer , it 's hot , the radios are blasting  --  brothers rapping , Spanish boys pleading , bad girls bitching  --  nobody knows a love song  --  then the gun goes off , far away , and I hear that , too , and later , sirens wailing . There 's an argument downstairs , the Puerto Rican girl and her Anglo boyfriend , cursing in different languages . All those sounds are the song , pieces of it , but I 'm listening for the one sound below it all , the one that pulls us down , the one that keeps us safe . Then I catch it : it 's the rain that 's stopped  --  it 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft hiss of tires through water , and it almost breaks me . <p> If I could find Rita now I 'd tell her she was right : junk is better than jazz . It 's fast and it does n't hurt you the way the music does . It 's easy . It takes you and you do n't have to do anything . It holds you tighter than you 've ever been held . You think it loves you . It knows where to lick and when to stop . When it hums in your veins , it says , Do n't worry , I 'm with you now . <p> I 'd tell her , The blues scare everybody . They make you remember things that did n't happen to you , make you feel your bones are n't yours only  --  they 've been splintered a thousand times ; the blood has poured out of you your whole life ; the rabbitman 's skin is your skin and the body you share is on fire . Or it 's simpler than that , and you 're just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Then you wish you did n't have to feel what they feel , and you get your wish , and you 're nobody but your own self , watching . <p> Every beat I played was a step closer to my uncle 's house where I listened to my cousins breathe in the bed above me , where I slept on the floor because Daddy was blind in our house , Daddy 's legs were swollen twice their size and stinking , Daddy was cut loose on his own poison and Mama was there , alone , with him  --  giving him whiskey , washing him , no matter what he said , no matter who he cursed . <p> My cousins take me to the woods , Lucy and Louise , one older , one younger ; they say , Touch me here , and here . They dare me , they giggle . They touch me and make me forget what 's happening across the field , in my house ; then they run away and I hear the grasshoppers chirping all around me , buzzing  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But smack , it makes you forget , it makes you not care , just like Rita said . It promises : There 's nothing more you need to know . So I did n't have to see my father 's never-clean clothes snapping on the line . I did n't have to remember Mama bent over the washtub in the yard , flesh of her arm quivering like she wanted to wash out evil as well as filth . I did n't have to go in the truck with Daddy that morning when he said it was time I saw my future . I did n't have to swing the sledgehammer with my boy 's arms or see the bull 's eyes , mad with disbelief . <p> But now I remember everything , how I struck the head but too close to the nose , so there was the crack , and blood spouting from the mouth but no crumpling , and Daddy said : Hold the place in your mind . I swung a second time , grazed the face , and the bull swelled with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all before my father grabbed the hammer : one blow , and the animal folded , knees bending , neck sagging , the whole huge beast collapsing on itself . <p> Then the others came , sawed off head and legs , slit skin from flesh , peeled the animal strange fruit  --  and there was blood , a river of it , hot , and there was blood , swirling at my feet . The body opened and there was blood weeping from the walls and the rabbitman ran so fast he ran out of his own skin and the bowels spilled , an endless rope , thick and heavy , full , and the smell , but the men work in the heat of the animal : kidneys , bladder , balls  --  saved , and the blood spatters them : faces , hands , thighs  --  they are soaked with it , I am soaked ; I will never be clean , and even the ceiling is dripping until at last the carcass is hung on a hook in the cold room full of bodies without legs or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I do forgive my father and my father dies and my grandparents forgive my mother for her bad marriage . I am fifteen . It 's November , still warm in Virginia but not in Boston , which is where we 're going , on the train , with my grandfather , who is kind enough but does n't know us , who wo n't come inside our house , who 's brought a suitcase full of clothes we have to wear and shoes that hurt our feet . He and Granny Booker mean to save us , mean to compensate . They say we can be anything . But all I want to be is the music , all I want to hear is the sound . Doctor Booker means I can be like him , and I think about that , the sharp razor 's edge of his scalpel , all his delicate knives . I feel his clamps . I touch speculum and forceps , imagining how precisely he opens the body , what he finds there when he does . I see the familiar brown spatters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I think , For all your pride , you 're no better than my father , no different , and the distance from his house to yours is only the space it takes a man to turn around . <p> I remember my father crying . It frightened me more than anything , more than the bull , more than the water where I thought I 'd drown . And this is all it was : scarecrow on a fence . He must have been going blind even then . He thought it was another one , body tangled in barbed wire . But it was only clothes stuffed with rags , pillowcase head tied off at the neck , straw hat and empty sleeves blowing in hot wind . <p> In prison I learned that my body itself is the enemy , my skin so black it reflects you . You want to take it from me . I terrify . Even when I am one and you are twenty . Even when I am cuffed and you have clubs . Even when I show you my empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . I do what any animal will do : no matter how many times you strike , I try to stand . I mean to stay alive . <p> Which is why the girl in the street scared me . I thought , Maybe she 's not a crackhead . Maybe she 's just a woman from the other side , lost in another country , running deeper into it because once you 're here you ca n't see your way out . Cross a road ; walk under a bridge ; that 's how far . No signs , no stone wall , but the line is tight as a border crossing . If you close your eyes it glitters like broken glass , pale and blue , a thousand shattered windshields . Here , every gesture is a code . Boys patrol their turf , four square blocks , pretend they own something . They travel in packs and arm themselves because they 're more afraid than any of us , because every time they look up the sky is falling , so they 're rapping about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're gon na torch . The little brothers are spinning on their heads , like this is some dance , some game  --  their bodies twist in ways they were never meant to bend , and then everybody in the street just falls down dead . <p> And the old men like me sit in the bars , drinking whiskey , going numb , talking about snatch and getting even all in the same breath , and we sound just like our own pitiful mamas , saying : Judgment Day gon na come , righteous gon na be raised up , and the wicked gon na suffer , rich or poor , do n't make no difference . Except the men , the justice they 're talking do n't have nothing to do with God . They 're full of the old words , saying , We ca n't come in the house we 're gon na knock it down ; then they sound just like the boys in the street , only tired and slurred , and the boys out there , they 're quick , they got matches and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever need to sleep . But the flames burst at their backs , and they 're the ones on fire . <p> We know the rules . Mess with white folks , you pay . Kill a white man , you hang . Kill a black man ? That 's just one more nigger off the street . So when I think about that girl , when I think , If she 's still out there , she 's in trouble , when I think even my mama would tell me I should go , I remind myself : I already done enough time for a white girl . I know how they are , how she 'd be scared of me even if I said , I just want to help you . And I know how it would look in the alley  --  big black man 's got his hands on a skinny white girl . Just my luck the boyfriend would come looking , shoot me dead . Nobody 'd ask him why . <p> I think , Maybe she 's already dead and I 'll find her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hand burned on her thigh . I do n't have a phone and anyway , too late to call . They 'd wan na know , Why 'd you wait so long , and I 'd be gone . <p> Last time they found a white woman dead on this hill police turned into a lynch mob , got the whole city screaming behind them . Roadblocks and strip searches . Stopped every dark-skinned man for miles if he was tall enough and not too old . Busted down doors , emptied closets , shredded mattresses , and never did find the gun that was already in the river . But they found the man they wanted : tall , raspy voice , like me . He 's got a record , long , shot a police officer once . He 's perfect . He can be sacrificed . No education , string of thefts . Even his own people are glad to turn him over , like there 's some evil here and all we got to do is cut it out . I 'm thinking , Nobody kills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignorant nigger . But the police , they do n't think that way . They need somebody . Turns out the husband did it . Shot his wife . Pregnant , too . Months later , white man jumps , bridge to river , January , he 's dead , then everybody knows . But that black guy , he 's still in jail . Violating parole . Some shit like that . Who knows ? They got him , they 're gon na keep him . <p> I hear two voices , and they both sound like my mama . One tells me , She 's human , go . And one whispers , You got to keep yourself alive . One 's my real mama and one a devil with my mama 's voice . <p> Something howled . I thought it was the wind . I wanted to lean into it , wrap my arms around it . I wanted it to have a mouth , to swallow me . Or I wanted to swallow it , to cry as it cried , loud and blameless . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now which voice belonged to my mama . I held the girl in my mind . She was light as a moth , bright as a flame . I knew she was dead . It was as if she 'd called my name , my real one , the one I did n't know until she spoke it . I felt her lungs filling under my hand . She said : There 's one warm place at the center of my body where I wait for you . <p> Stray finds her . Mangy wolf of a dog . Smells her . Even in this cold , he knows . And it 's like he loves her , the way he calls , just whining at first , these short yelps , high and sad , and when nobody comes he starts howling , loud enough to wake the dead , I think , but not her . And it 's day , the first one . <p> We 're out there in the cold , nine of us in the alley , hunched , hands in pockets , no hats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is saying , Shit , shit , because he remembers , we all remember , the last time . <p> I see her , close , thirty-five at least but small , so I thought she was a girl , and I think of her that way now . I kneel beside her . Her eyes are open , irises shattered like blue glass . Wind ruffles her nightgown , exposes her . Snow blows through her hair , across bare legs , between blue lips . I see bruises on her thighs , cuts on her hands , a face misaligned , and I think , I have bones like these , broken , healed , never the same . My hand aches in the cold . <p> I know now what happened , why she 's here . I see her keeper . She smokes his cigarettes , he whacks her . She drinks his beer , he drags her to the toilet , holds her head in the bowl . He 's sorry . I 've heard the stories . I 've seen the women . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man in the eye . I 've been kicked awake at three a.m. because some mother fucker I offended told the guards I had a knife . The keepers make the rules , but they 're always shifting : we ca n't be good enough . <p> Police stay quiet . Do n't want to look like fools again . And nobody 's asking for this girl . Stray , like the dog . They got time . <p> I know now what her body tells them : stomach empty , liver enlarged , three ribs broken , lacerations on both hands  --  superficial wounds , old bruises blooming like yellow flowers on her back and thighs . Death by exposure . No crime committed here . And they do n't care who cut her , and they do n't care who broke her ribs , because all her people are dead or do n't give a shit , and she was the one , after all , who ran out in the snow , so who 's to say she did n't want to die . <p> I drink port @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , back to back , one kills the taste of the other . I ca n't get drunk . Three days now since we found her and I see her whole life , like she 's my sister and I grew up with her . She 's a child with a stick drawing pictures in the dirt . She 's drawn a face and I think it must be her own face but I say , What are you drawing ; and she says , Someone to love me . I say , What are you trying to do , break my heart ? And she says , If you have a heart , I 'll break it . I say , Where 's your mama ? And she says , She 's that pretty lady with red lips and high heels  --  you 've probably seen her  --  but sometimes her lipstick 's smeared all down her chin and her stockings are ripped and she 's got one shoe in her hand and the spike is flying toward me  --  that 's my mother . I say , Where 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flannel shirt torn at the shoulder hanging in the closet ever since I 've been alive and my mother says , That 's the reason why . <p> Then I see she 's not a child ; she 's a full-grown woman , and her hands are cut , her hands are bleeding , and I say , Who did this to you ? She wo n't answer , but I know , I see him , he 's her lover , he 's metal flashing , he 's a silver blade in the dark , and she tries to grab him but he 's too sharp . Then she 's running , she 's crying , and I see her in the street , and I think she 's just some crazy white girl too high to feel the cold , and I do n't go . <p> Now she 's talking to me always . She 's the sound underneath all other sounds . She wo n't go away . She says , I used to make angels in the snow , like this ; I used to lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wings and skirt , but that night I was too cold , so I just lay down , curled into myself , see , here , and I saw you at your window , and I knew you were afraid , and I wanted to tell you , I 'm always afraid , but after I lay down I was n't so cold , and I was almost happy , and I was almost asleep , but I wanted to tell you , I 'm your little white sister  --  I know you  --  we 're alone . <p> <p> <p> By MELANIE RAE THON <p>
