Section : PRIORITIES SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY In their eagerness to do good with their dollars , unwary environmentalists may be contributing to polluters ' profits . <p> While seals and otters have nothing to cheer about in the aftermath of the Exxon Valdez spill , the crocodile is smiling broadly . Amid the oily sludge of the country 's worst environmental catastrophe , Wall Street has found a wonderful investment prospect . <p> " Worldwide shock at the consequences of the disaster in Alaska could increase efforts to protect the environment , " Merrill Lynch tells its brokers . <p> " Pollution is a problem , but for investors with a long-term outlook , it could be an opportunity . " <p> " Daily environmental news was a sales booster for many brokers , " reports Stephen Parker , chair of the John Hancock subsidiary Freedom Family of Funds . " We are confident that environmental action will be a major growth industry throughout the 1990s . " <p> The environmental-services sector in the United States is growing at a phenomenal 15 to 2() percent a year , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time , a significant majority of Americans now consider themselves environmentalists . To take advantage of this situation , Merrill Lynch , John Hancock , and Fidelity Investments have all come out with new environmental sector funds-stock funds that feature companies expected to profit from the anticipated multibillion-dollar environmental cleanup of the ' 90s . <p> Brokers are making " cold calls " to environmentalists , trying to sell them on social responsibility . Hancock advises brokers to sell the Freedom Environmental Fund as " an investment you 'll feel good about because it gives you a chance to invest your money in a ' socially responsible ' way . " The fund 's prospectus promises to invest only in companies that " contribute to a cleaner and healthier environment " and even to help drive down the value of stocks of companies that according to Hancock have damaged the environment . <p> The pitch appears to be working . Freedom 's initial offering brought in $46 million ; Merrill Lynch sold out its initial $50-million offering in three days , and $83 million more came in before brokers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if Wall Street has suddenly turned green . <p> But then , green has always been the color of money . The portfolios of all three of these major " environmental funds " include some of the worst polluters in the country , companies whose expansion is now being financed by the investment dollars of well-meaning environmentalists . <p> For instance , all three funds include the giant waste-disposal firms Waste Management , Inc. and Browning-Ferris Industries , which together have been forced to pay more than $450 million in fines over the last decade for violating environmental and antitrust laws , and which have received more than a thousand citations for dumpsite violations . Both companies have pioneered new recycling methods : Waste Management by selling PCB-contaminated oil as home heating oil in Ohio , Browning-Ferris by mixing oil with toxic nitrobenzene and using it to surface dirt roads in East Texas . ( Fines and bad publicity from this and other violations led Browning-Ferris to sell its hazardous-waste business in April . ) <p> Moreover , Waste Management 's " Recycle America " trucks have been spotted dumping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Chemical Waste Management  --  also part of the Freedom Environmental portfolio  --  is the only U.S. company engaged in the ocean incineration of toxic waste . Among Freedom 's other nominal environmental investments is Combustion Engineering , which makes boilers for nuclear power plants . The Fidelity Select Environmental Fund includes Perkin-Elmer , a nuclear-weapons contractor , and Westinghouse , a manufacturer of nuclear power plants . <p> Based on Hancock 's " green " prospectus , Peter Camejo , president of the socially responsible brokerage firm Progressive Asset Management in Oakland , California , initially recommended the Hancock Freedom Environmental Fund to his clients . He has since changed his mind . " People are investing in these funds , believing they 're helping the environment , when they 're not necessarily helping the environment at all , " he explains . " Their money may actually be going to companies that are major polluters in the worst sense of the word . " <p> Ruth Dyke , a client of Camejo 's who bought into the Freedom Environmental Fund , has filed charges of false advertising and use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) . " I am left with the impression that you want to appear as though you are concerned about our environment so that people like myself will invest in your fund , " she wrote to David Beckwith , the fund 's manager . " But in reality you will invest in any company , in certain industrial sectors , regardless of their environmental record . Just because Waste Management picks up garbage does not make them a contributor to our environment . " <p> Beckwith , however , believes that it does . In a recent article in the new Hampshire Business Review he says that companies like Waste Management " are socially positive by definition . They contribute to a clean environment by what they do . " <p> Freedom CEO Parker acknowledges that environmentalists may want a stricter definition of what constitutes a green firm . " We are going to have a problem meeting their standards , " he says . And since neither the SEC nor the National Association of Securities Dealers regulates what makes a company " socially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being taken in by the Wall Street crocodiles . <p> There is an alternative . Funds do exist that screen for polluters and go out of their way to find companies that are making a positive contribution to the environment . Three of these are sector funds investing exclusively in environmental companies : the New Alternatives Fund of Great Neck , New York , which specializes in alternativeenergy firms ; Progressive Asset Management 's Progressive Environmental Fund ; and Merrill Lynch 's newest fund , Eco-Logical Trust ' 90 , which promises a portion of its profits to the environmental movement . Other ethical funds that use environmental screens but also invest more widely include Calvert , Parnassus , Pax World , Dreyfus , and Working Assets . <p> An environmental screen does not , however , absolve the investor of responsibility . The criteria employed by these screens tend to be subjective , and the degree of rigor varies widely . The Dreyfus Third Century Fund , for example , calls for examination of a company 's " protections and improvement of the environment , " a screen loose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to slip through . At Parnassus , investment decisions are made by founder Jerome Dodson . " I actually ca n't tell you what our criteria are , " he says . " Each one is different . All we say is that we take environmental protection into consideration . " <p> Other funds have more formal mechanisms . Calvert 's Social Investment Fund considers itself to be " among the most comprehensive and stringent in the socially responsible investment community . " Its advisory board , which includes Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Fischer , makes general policy recommendations and attempts to resolve questions in the " gray areas " of corporate responsibility . One recent dilemma involved a pharmaceutical company that used endangered species , obtained illegally , to test AIDS drugs ; the board deadlocked on the issue , and the investment was not made . <p> Calvert 's screen includes consultation with local environmental groups , but that did not stop the fund from investing ( along with Working Assets and New Alternatives ) in Hawaii Electric , which is seeking to develop a 500-megawatt geothermal power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Big Island . ( See " Hot Spots , " May/June . ) The project is being vigorously opposed by the Rainforest Action Network and the Sierra Club , among others . While neither Calvert nor Working Assets continues to hold Hawaii Electric stock , the decision to drop the company was made for economic reasons , not environmental ones . <p> " No one 's going to be perfect , " says Doug Fleer , an editor at Clean Yield , an ethical-investment newsletter . " If you had a really strict screening process , where anyone with an EPA violation was out , you would n't have a fund . " <p> One safe , socially responsible way to invest money is to leave it in a credit union , where funds often finance local projects . Investors who want the higher returns of a stock fund , however , must take it upon themselves to research the social and environmental criteria used by each fund , and not rely on crocodile smiles . They do n't call it filthy lucre for nothing . <p> CARTOON <p> By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Berkeley , California . <p>
