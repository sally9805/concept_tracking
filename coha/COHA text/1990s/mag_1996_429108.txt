Museums and Native American artifacts do not always enjoy a happy relationship these days . " To Touch the Past : The Painted Pottery of the Mimbres People , " a major exhibition recently on view at the Frederick R Weisman Art Museum at the University of Minnesota , Minneapolis ( April I4-June i ) , was informed throughout by an acute awareness of the politics of archaeological excavation and museum presentation , which is not necessarily the same thing as political correctness . The exhibition 's principal curator was J. J. Brody , professor emeritus at the University of New Mexico and the leading authority on Mimbres pottery . But two Native American potters , Nathan Begaye and Diego Romero , acted as cocurators . The designer John Garrigan , responsible for the understated but handsome installation , mercifully free of southwestern " earth tones , " is also Native American , a Chippewa currently living in Santa Fe . Instead of a conventional essay , the catalogue features what amounts to an extended dialogue between Brody and Rina Swentzell , a Pueblo Indian potter and scholar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the past and the problems of the present . The University of Minnesota collection of over 6oo pieces , transferred a short time ago from the anthropology department to the Art Museum , came from archaeological digs by faculty and students from 1929 to 1931 . These were not always conducted in a purely scientific fashion , since non-pottery artifacts were often ignored in the search for " trophy " pots . The Mimbres pots that were found , though some showed signs of wear from everyday use , were taken from burial sites , since it was customary to place inverted bowls over the heads of corpses . Field notes suggest that the human remains were not always treated respectfully . As if that were n't enough , there is evidence of racist attitudes on the part of the expedition members toward the local HispanicAmericans hired to help with the dig . No wonder that Swentzell believes that unearthing such artifacts is a sign of disrespect for the beliefs of the Mimbres people . She rejects " European-oriented " arguments proclaiming archaeology as a necessary instrument for the advancement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she argues that " humans do not need to know everything there is to be known . " Compared to the question of where Mimbres pottery belongs , the question of to whom it belongs is made less pressing if no less sensitive because the Mimbres no longer exist as an independent , identifiable people . The Mimbres established communities along the Mimbres River of what is now south central New Mexico . ( Mimbres is the Spanish word for " willow . " ) Their civilization disappeared around 1400 , not that long after the Classic period of the pottery ( 1000-1150 ) , for unknown reasonsprobably drought and overpopulation . No tribe among the native peoples of the Southwest claims to be directly descended from the Mimbres , so no formal claims have been filed for ownership of the artifacts . Yet that does not stop the moral waters surrounding the approximately Io , ooo pots that survive in public and private collections from being murky . With Mimbres pottery highly prized on the art market , sites have been looted . The site excavated by the Minnesota @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property in an attempt to uncover still more pots . For all the political , ethical and historical questions surrounding Mimbres pottery , one thing seems beyond question : its quality . The work fully deserves the reputation that has unfortunately placed the sites in such jeopardy . The appeal of Mimbres " ceramic paintings " to tastes formed on modern art is immediately evident , as can be seen in a dancing figure displaying a lyricism that Matisse might envy . The pieces are with few exceptions relatively straightforward hemispheric bowls , with decoration infrequent on the outside . Swentzell is convincing when she argues that in Mimbres pottery , as in Pueblo pottery , " it 's the whole cosmos that 's contained within the pot . " The rim of the bowl is analogous to the horizon , so that many of the geometric designs found around the edge represent mountains and the internal patterns indicate river gorges , lightning , rain and other elements of nature . It is possible that what we see as abstract geometric designs are in fact stylized representations . In any event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes far beyond the mechanical articulation of a set of patterns to daring plays between symmetry and asymmetry , figure and ground , and rectilinear and curvilinear , all marked by tremendous rhythmic energy as pattern works against pattern or the whole design seems to whirl around the center . One ingenious demonstration of this spinning-and Mimbres humor-occurs in a pot that features a group of insects on the periphery , with tongues ( or sucking tubes ) all pointing toward the center so they join in what becomes a fine linear spiral . Photograph The Mimbres bowls shown here , all coilbuilt , ca.10001130/1150 , were used as serving vessels and many were later buried with the dead . The pots often were found with a hole in the center , where they had been punctured for burial . According to modern Pueblo thinking , the bowl , regarded as a living thing , was thus " killed ; so its breath could flow back into the cosmos .

Individual characteristics may seem elementary , such as eyes depicted by a dot in the middle of a circle . Yet there is consistent inventiveness even in details , like the way teeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by shorter lines . For all the repeated motifs and stylistic consistency , the images display endless variation , as when two bowls featuring pronghorn antelope show the animals divided into sections in completely different ways , each a wonder . Mimbres designs repeatedly balance abstract and figural tendencies , but nowhere in more astonishing fashion than in what at first appears to be a purely geometric design but a second look reveals as an insect with four feet and a head . A fish , placed neatly off-center , features a design on its back that suggests both anatomical markings and riplets of water , fostering the illusion of motion , as if the fish were swimming through the bowl . Like so many aspects of the pottery and the people who made it , the connection between the designs and the actual world of the Mimbres is still in many ways an open question . There are representations of animals that are not native to the area-for instance , Mexican parrots-but can be explained by referring to a wide network of trading relationships . There are also what appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wraithlike figure . Little is known of many of the motifs , and there are notable differences of opinion about interpretation . Swentzell regards a famous design of a large figure whose penis is being held up by a crew of smaller figures as a comic critique of patriarchy , while Begaye views the pot as a tribute to clan fertility . The great popularity of Mimbres pottery and the strength , beauty and wit of the designs have led to a classic example of artistic revivalism , for better and for worse . Mimbres designs have been used in modern pots as far back as the I920S , when Maria Martinez , the most famous Indian potter of the century , and her husband , Julian , started using a Mimbres feather design as a signature element in their San Ildefonso pots . An exhibition called " The Mimbres Tradition : New Uses for an Old Art , " at the Minneapolis gallery Ancient Traditions , organized to coincide with the Weisman exhibit , featured 25 artists known for their work with Mimbres motifs who were specially commissioned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a town in Mexico that is now virtually a pottery factory town , were prominently featured , along with a wide range of Southwestern Native American potters and even non-Native pieces . Some of the contemporary work displays undeniable skill and retains a sense of personal style . But virtuosity often becomes mere slickness , resulting in pots covered with Mimbres motifs but with a sense of design that lacks the daring-and **26;224;TOOLONG for the appeal of many of the classic pots . That is why among the most satisfying pieces for me were the deliberately non-flashy , traditional works of Mary Lewis Garcia , daughter of Lucy Lewis , who may have been the first potter from Acoma Pueblo to turn to Mimbres designs , in the I950s . A beautiful little hummingbird pot by Garcia captures the feel of the original Mimbres work without any sense of false naivete . At the Weisman , a small selection of pottery by Begaye and Romero suggests other possible approaches to the Mimbres tradition . Begaye , half Navajo and half Hopi , is a master of geometric polychrome design , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A jar , unmistakably phallic in form , has the Mimbres design that provoked the disagreement between Begaye and Swentzell on one side and Hopi fertility images on the other . In this case the juxtaposition appears intellectual rather than organic . Yet a low double-walled bowl that Begaye describes as " about the beginning of time " is a great work , with a massive clay form beautifully complemented by a few simple motifs-a spiral , a door , a man . Another low bowl is equally successful in finding a contemporary equivalent for the Mimbres spirit . It features dragonfly forms in the bottom , against black , while the outside has green storm motifs so that the whole is meant to suggest dragonflies in a pool surrounded by moss . Such extraordinary free adaptation goes far beyond mere copying . Romero , for his part , is one of the most successful contemporary satirists I know , in any medium . His pottery combines Mimbres elements with a Pop sensibility . One pot features a comic book version of the artist 's father as a Korean war hero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lichtenstein painting by having a native woman proclaim to a Romero alter ego , " Wow , Chongo , this bowl is a masterpiece ! Soon you 'll have all Santa Fe clamoring for your work . " In other pieces the Mimbres style , sometimes with self-conscious borrowings from classic Greek pottery , is used to illustrate historical episodes involving Native Americans , the Spanish and the Catholic Church . Then there are scenes of the contemporary Southwest that have Mimbres-style figures driving cars and living in mobile homes . The designs are obviously not mere facsimiles of old pots but demonstrate an equivalent graphic strength and individuality . One touch is especially significant , for Romero uses a cutaway view to show skeletons with pots over their heads below the ground , a deliberate reminder of the Mimbres . " To Touch the Past , " and especially the exhibition catalogue , addressed the controversies surrounding Mimbres pottery with commendable directness and sensitivity . Even so , the joy of seeing such magnificent work is ultimately a mixed blessing , since " disinterested , " aesthetic viewing is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weisman gift shop 's ceramic reproductions , rubber stamps , pins and note cards emblazoned with Mimbres motifs , like the well-intentioned but uneven gathering of work from Mata Ortiz and elsewhere at the downtown gallery , provided one more reminder of the distance between ceramics as part of a communal experience and ceramics as business , as part of the art market . Consideration of Southwest pottery past or present is , I find , a somewhat disheartening exercise , shadowed by issues of exploitation , commercialization and social change . Of course , it is also a heartening exercise , because so much of the work is impressive . In that light , Romero 's satire , Begaye 's free adaptation of Mimbres motifs and the traditionalism of Garcia were especially welcome , as admirable reminders of how one can touch the past yet remain firmly in the present .
