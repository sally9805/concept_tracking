<p> For years , the so-called " gypsy " parking lots around Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium have been a convenient fixture for Braves fans . Now , a recent City Council ruling will take away most of those spots . Some say the ruling will help revitalize the surrounding neighborhood , but others say the move takes money out of the pockets of lot owners and workers and will also cause a traffic headache for those attending stadium events . <p> YES Neighborhood ca n't revitalize around parking <p> I grew up in Summerhill . This neighborhood was home to four generations of my family . My grandmother moved into the area in 1905 . We have a house on Reed Street . And we do n't like " gypsy " lots . <p> There is no way we can revitalize Summerhill around parking lots . We ca n't convince someone to invest $ 50,000 in a home next to a gravel lot . You ca n't make this a community in which people would want to raise a family when it looks like one big parking lot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ballpark , then ask it to provide parking when you have ample transit . It 's just plain shortsightedness on the part of people who run those lots and do n't live here . <p> Now that the Olympics are coming and they are building the new stadium , everybody wants a piece of land around here to turn into a parking lot . They could n't fill up the stadium parking a few years ago . Now that the Braves are playing well , everyone wants to tear down a house and turn it into a lot . <p> The real question is : Should Summerhill , Mechanicsville and Peoplestown be used as a parking lot for Braves fans ? Are we really going to allow these three neighborhoods the opportunity to be revitalized with that window of opportunity the Olympic stadium brings ? <p> We are now getting commitments from banks and other institutions for home loans in these areas . Businesses are now getting loans . <p> Should a few people making a few bucks on parking be the downfall of an entire neighborhood ? <p> We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity to grow because of them . They have been tearing down houses and turning them into parking lots for the last five years . <p> We could have negotiated 15,000 parking spaces with the city and gotten 10 percent of the revenue for our own community programs . But we did n't buy into that . It would have stopped revitalization . This is n't about just money for us . It 's about our neighborhood . <p> Lot owners do n't even want to fix up the parking lots to make them look nice . They throw some gravel down and create a make-shift lot . <p> They only want to make a buck , and in a flash they are gone to another side of town to their middle-class communities . When the game is over they take that money and leave debris behind . The lots do not provide jobs for anyone in the neighborhood . <p> This is a short-term money making deal that 's more negative to the community than building the stadium . You can not argue that you are in support of neighborhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a parking lot . <p> Investors should start talking about economic opportunities , like grocery stores and restaurants . Take that energy and turn it into a service for the people who live here and the people who go to games . Parking can not be the only economic stimulus . <p> We will oppose any massive number of parking spaces in this community . The Braves should find some other place to turn into a parking lot . <p> Doug C. Dean is the president of Summerhill Neighborhood Inc . <p> NO ' City is yanking the rug out from under us ' <p> I lived in Summerhill about 25 years . I made enough money to move away , but I still kept a house and business over there for income . <p> I bought five vacant lots and three houses in Summerhill . I fixed up the houses and cleaned off the lots next to them . There were other houses I was n't able to buy , but I leased the land next to them and cleaned them up , too . <p> I got in touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a deal with them to keep up the lot . In return , they let me use it for my parking business . I kept them all cleaned off so they would n't look so bad . <p> Now the city is yanking the rug out from under us . The city said since we put up parking lots , the value of the land went up . Now they want the land for low-income housing . <p> But I say there are plenty of other places to put up houses . Why take somebody 's income away ? We are just people out here trying to make it . <p> To build those low-income houses might be good for some people , but what about the people who are already here ? <p> MARTA put some money into the neighborhood once but it did n't help anything . It was we who cleaned the area up . <p> I understand that they want to give people an opportunity to own their own homes . What about those people who already have homes and want to operate parking lots ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You ca n't get any definite answers from the city . We are thinking about trying to take a legal action to see what can be done for the rest of the baseball season . We do n't know what we can do . <p> People got season tickets , you know . There are some people who do n't want to get season tickets because they wo n't have any place to park . <p> I 've got one group of regular customers . They all meet at my lot and they know I got a place for them reserved . They look for me and my lot . It 's special because they do n't always arrive at the same time and I 'm reliable . <p> Anybody with common sense knows that when you build this Olympic stuff around that property values go up . They went up and now they want to run us all out of there . <p> I have two children I raised in Summerhill . They helped out on lots when they were kids . This money helped send them to college . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low-income housing , maybe they should go where property values are more reasonable . Everybody wants this land now . Nobody wanted it 25 years ago . How are they are going to build low-income housing on this high-priced land ? <p> They ought to just let us have our lots and let us go on making our living down here . <p> Lewis Sterling , owner of Sterling Experienced Movers , has nine of the temporary lots in the Summerhill neighborhood .
