<p> FORT COLLINS - The school known for doing more with less accomplished far more with far less than most Colorado State fans ever imagined this season . <p> Life 's little necessities for any college student were sacrificed in the name of team unity . Depending upon each individual 's motives , cookies , other sweets , beer , chew , or even TV became off-limits from two-a-days until the Mountain West Conference title-clinching finale at UNLV . <p> Sometimes , nonmaterial joys fell by the wayside . <p> ' I gave up complaining . At times I messed up . I gave up beer . At times I slipped up , ' CSU defensive end Clark Haggans said . ' Giving up beer is too easy . Giving up complaining is almost impossible for me . It worked , for the most part . ' <p> Credit the Rams ' turnaround from an 0-2 league start to a share of the MWC title to a reversal of injury misfortunes , the maturation of the offense or the superb coaching job by Sonny Lubick and his staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , the Rams credit the one person who insists on staying in the background , team chaplain Johnny Square . <p> ' A lot of people do n't know about Johnny . Without him I do n't think we 'd be the team that we are , ' offensive tackle Blane Saipaia said . ' He taught us how to keep faith not only in the team but in yourself . ' <p> Square played wide receiver for the Rams from 1973-76 and still looks as though he can run some pass patterns with the best of them . He is the pastor for the Iasis Christ Fellowship in Fort Collins . He met Lubick in the early 1980s when Lubick was a CSU assistant and Square held informal Bible study sessions . <p> ' When Sonny came back , I was n't here two weeks when he called , ' Square said . ' I was quite humbled . He said we needed to build together slowly over several years . <p> ' Sonny and I keep what we do behind the scenes . ' <p> Square annually develops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as relating to a unique aspect for that fall . During Lubick 's first season as CSU 's coach , in 1993 , the natural theme was that of a giant killer from David . The next year , when CSU made its first trip to the Holiday Bowl , the players voted Square the person who made the biggest contribution to the team with the least recognition . <p> This season presented new challenges after the Rams failed to meet expectations a year ago and the traditional team unity unraveled . <p> ' What motivated me was a cue I got from the ( women 's ) basketball team when Becky ( Hammon ) was talking about the run they had and a lot of girls sacrificed things , ' Square said . ' Because of the season last year when CSU had high expectations , we all got a little arrogant . That does n't do well here when arrogance comes in . We 're a blue-collar team . We need our basic family orientation of ' let 's help each other . " <p> So Square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ' If anyone would come after me , he must deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me . ' <p> Self-sacrifice and self-denial became the 1999 season 's theme . <p> ' If we as a team want to accomplish certain things , there are things we have to give up , ' Square said . ' For me it was sweets . For ( running backs coach Mick ) Delaney it was cigars . For some players it was no partying or drinking . ' <p> Said Haggans : ' I think it just helped out , because everyone sacrificed something . You know they 're giving up something they usually do . You know that person is trying to do something positive . It just shows what team players mean . We just bonded together better . ' <p> Everyone talks the talk in August . When the Rams were reeling in mid-October at 3-3 and in last place in the MWC , players hit bottom off the field as well . There were the usual problems regarding the classroom , tight personal finances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season turning point came at a regular Thursday night prayer meeting . <p> ' It was n't just football going bad . A lot of things off the field were going bad in people 's lives , ' Haggans said . ' We all just came together . Rather than talking about the Bible , we kind of shared what was going on in each other 's lives . We pulled together and prayed . <p> ' I figure everyone had a lot of problems , and the only way to go was up when you have that love . It was nothing tragic , just the problems you go through . I think after losing the San Diego State game , everything was magnified . It seemed the whole world was crumbling . We just prayed for each other for about half an hour . <p> ' The next weekend , things started to get better in people 's lives . ' <p> That meeting stood out for Square for another reason . Others sacrificed their desserts and beer , but backup cornerback Duan Ruff put aside far more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Thursday night group , ' Square said . <p> Despondent over his lack of playing time , Square said Ruff told the group he had been too selfish and his attitude was wrong . <p> ' My goodness , when a man says he is going to change his attitude and is willing to sit ( on the bench ) for sake of the team He wo n't allow that to become poison , ' Square said . <p> Said Lubick : ' I think it 's done a tremendous amount of good . The work Johnny does with the players and the way they believe in him , it 's been tremendous . ' <p> The theme was presented on a level for everyone to relate . <p> ' The self-denial thing is for guys who do n't have a spiritual relationship to work together with guys who do , and we 'd all mesh in the middle , ' backup quarterback Steve Cutlip said . ' Even guys who were n't spiritually involved , it was a thing to say , ' I give up something I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> ' For guys like myself who do have a spiritual relationship , it kind of brought us together as a team and helped us grow stronger in our spiritual life . It was fun because it was , ' Let 's give something up for each other . ' It was a brotherhood type thing . ' <p> There was even one sacrifice Square was unaware of . Lubick took great pride recounting the story of talking in August to walk-on Lucas Mallory of Boulder about a scholarship . Mallory told him to give it to either Justin or Jason Gallimore , because the brothers from Wheat Ridge needed it more , since their father had recently died . <p> Not everyone made a huge sacrifice . Kevin McDougal , seen carrying around a bag of McDonald 's as often as he carries the football , could n't part with the Golden Arches , but he said he gave up something he preferred not to disclose . <p> ' When you saw guys give up things , it was one more thing to bring the team together , ' McDougal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an athlete . Johnny always talks about being a three-dimensional athlete : the physical , mental and spiritual . You can have the best physical specimen , the smartest guy in the world , but if you do n't have something to keep you grounded , something to work for , which is the spiritual , it does n't matter . ' <p> McDougal described the combined efforts of Square and the training room staff as ' angels ' through his spate of injuries . <p> ' For a guy like Kevin , it would be easy to go into the tank depressed and not come out of it , ' Cutlip said . ' Johnny helped him a lot . ' <p> Square 's influence permeates the team . Unlike many sports organizations , the Rams do n't have cliques of athletes drawn along racial lines . <p> ' Johnny always says at chapel : ' There are no starters , no coaches , no scout team , no black , no white . We 're all people , " Haggans said . ' The only color here is everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racial limitations . ' <p> Square insists no players were forced to buy into the theme or to attend pregame chapel or Thursday night meetings . By the same token , no one of any faith is excluded . <p> ' What we want to present is you have to believe in something beyond yourself , ' Square said . ' It 's about men worshiping God . ' <p> Square said he gives of his time because he ca n't give money to his alma mater . He is not on the department payroll , although his travel expenses are covered on road games . <p> ' He 's as much a friend and a mentor to kids in that they have the ability to say what they want , ' CSU athletic director Tim Weiser said . ' He represents a safe place for the kids to go . Boosters come to the chapel meetings and say it gives them an appreciation for the kids in a perspective different from being football players . ' <p> The bonding of the season 's theme is expected to carry over into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended with the regular-season finale . <p> Even Square admits the temptations for sweets during the Christmas season is too much . <p> ' Coach ( Tom ) Ehlers was asking if the sacrifice goes to bowl week . After UNLV , he said , ' I got ta eat , " Haggans said of CSU 's defensive line coach , who lost 18 pounds while pushing away the desserts . ' I said , ' It 's the postseason , coach . " @p#
