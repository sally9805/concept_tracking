Five years ago , police in the resort town of Wadduwa , Sri Lanka , raided a seaside hotel owned by a German and his Sri Lankan wife . The building was occupied not by tourists but by 20 young Sri Lankan women and their 22 infants , some just a few weeks old . The hotel was a " baby farm , " where foreigners looking for children to adopt could come to browse , and for a fee $ of $1,000 to $5,000 , have their pick of the babies . The mothers , all desperately poor , would get about $50 in exchange for each of their children . <P> The Wadduwa baby farm was shut down , but the international traffic in children for adoption remains a big business . Every year , unscrupulous baby brokers in Asia , Latin America and now Eastern Europe hand over hundreds of children to North American and West European parents willing to pay large sums for a healthy child  --  and ignore evidence that the infant was obtained illegally . In Peru , the traffic is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the street and ask if they are interested in adopting a baby . <P> Last April , CBS 's 60 Minutes secretly filmed baby brokers in Romania negotiating with parents for the sale of their children to Americans . " The word got out here in the States that kids could be easily had in Romania , as long as you brought enough money , " says a senior U.S. immigration official . For David McCall , the adoption of his Romanian-born son , two-year-old Adrian , felt uncomfortably like baby buying . " When we started out trying to adopt , it was going to cost $2,500 , " says the Houston teacher . " In the end we paid $5,000 , and I ca n't really tell you where all the money went . Someone is getting paid . " <P> Sometimes the question of parental consent is especially murky . Severino Hernandez of Guatemala was five years old in 1989 when he was adopted by Paul David Kutz of Rockwell City , Iowa . Severino 's grandparents , with whom he had lived since birth , say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they are suing in Guatemala to have the adoption nullified and the boy returned . According to the Hernandezes ' lawsuit , the youngster was secretly given up for adoption by his mother , who never had formal custody . Contacted by TIME , Kutz insisted the adoption was " 100% honest " but refused to add any details . <P> To stop the baby traffic , Romania forbade all adoptions by foreigners until it formulates new procedures ; it is not expected to begin again soon . Few Third World countries are likely to follow suit . Ending foreign adoptions would not necessarily stop the buying and stealing of babies . It would merely , as one Sri Lankan lawyer points out , dump thousands more orphans and abandoned children into the care of the state  --  a burden that neither Sri Lanka nor most other poor countries are equipped to bear .
