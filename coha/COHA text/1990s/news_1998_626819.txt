<p> TIJUANA , Mexico - On a shady boulevard called Paseo de los Heroes - where a movie theater shows such distinctly American fare as Godzilla and Dr. Dolittle - 42 baseball fans piled into an idling tour bus . <p> Their destination was n't a ballpark in Tijuana or anywhere else in Mexico . They were journeying north , across the border , to attend a game between the San Diego Padres and Houston Astros . <p> " I have done this every Sunday for the past three years , " said 53-year-old Adalberto Gomez , who is decked out in a Padres T-shirt and a Padres hat festooned with 22 different Padres pins . " I love it . " <p> The weekly bus trips from border towns including Tijuana , Mexicali and Ensenada are sponsored by Tecate Beer and the Padres club , which supplies discount tickets and free bus fare across the border . <p> On this Sunday , it took the bus about 40 minutes to pass through customs and travel the 20-odd miles to Qualcomm Stadium . As they arrived , passengers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flies over the stadium every Sunday . <p> Crossing the parking lot , a message over loudspeakers welcomed them in Spanish and English . A five-piece mariachi band strolled the grounds , playing a brokenhearted ballad that moved one woman to leap up and plant a big kiss on the surprised singer . <p> Welcome to Domingos Padres Tecate - a double-entendre that means both Padres Sundays with Tecate and Cool Sundays with Tecate . It is the centerpiece in the Padres ' effort to woo Hispanic baseball fans in San Diego County and from across the border . <p> Numbering 30 million and growing rapidly , the U.S. Hispanic population represents a huge potential market for U.S. baseball teams , including those far from the U.S.-Mexican border . According to the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce , the current purchasing power of the U.S. Hispanic market is $ 348 billion annually . <p> A small but growing number of teams - including the San Diego Padres , Florida Marlins and Arizona Diamondbacks - have moved into the forefront of baseball teams successfully marketing themselves to Hispanic fans . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the economically distressed club was purchased by Houston native John Moores . <p> " We had to solve the problem of San Diego being in a box . We have the desert to the east ; the Pacific to the west , the Los Angeles Dodgers to the north , and Mexico to the south , " said Moores , who made his fortune as the co-founder of BMC Software . " We could n't make the desert bloom . We could n't drain the Pacific , and we could n't make the Dodgers go away . " <p> One option was to market the club to Tijuana , where population estimates run as high as 2 million . Another was to reverse the club 's tradition of indifference - some critics had dubbed the Padres " Champions of Neglect " - to the Hispanic residents of San Diego County . <p> " It 's amazing , really . Our owner is from Houston and our team president ( Larry Lucchino ) is from Pittsburgh . It took them to do this , " said Enrique Morones , director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ native . " Of all of the owners we had from San Diego , none of them ever did anything like this . The Hispanic people 's reaction is ' It 's about time ! We 've always been here . We are glad you finally recognized us ! ' " <p> ' Hispanics love baseball ' <p> It 's no secret that beisbol has an avid following in Latin America . In fact , there are more Hispanic players in Major League Baseball than there are African-American players . <p> " Hispanics love baseball , " declared Rolando Becerra , who announced Astros games on Spanish-language radio from 1986 to 1992 . " But we are a funny people . If we are not invited someplace , we will not go . If you do not say ' Hola ! ' to us , we will not be there . " <p> After Moores and Lucchino bought the Padres , they realized the team had no idea how to say " Hola . " <p> " Larry wanted a press release translated into Spanish , but no one in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Padres senior vice president for public affairs . " He was mortified . " <p> To get help , the Padres approached Morones , president of the city 's Hispanic Chamber of Commerce . After working together in an unofficial capacity for several months , the Padres hired Morones to become the first director of Hispanic marketing in Major League Baseball . <p> In August 1996 , the Padres hosted the first regular-season games played in Mexico - a three-game series against the New York Mets in Monterrey . <p> Every Sunday for the past three years , the Padres have pushed Domingos Padres , bringing a total of 24,000 Mexican fans across the border . Thousands of others have bought tickets and crossed the border via trolley or by driving their own cars . <p> The Padres also are the first baseball team to open a retail store in Mexico . Stocked to the hilt with Padres hats , shirts and jackets , the store in Tijuana is as polished as most any sporting apparel store you 'll find in the United States . <p> " So far this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said store manager Fausto Mendoza . " Our merchandise sales have tripled since the first year we opened . " <p> Since Moores bought the team , total attendance at Padres games has doubled , surpassing 2 million fans per year . But much of that increase probably can be attributed to fielding a vastly improved team . More to the point , the Hispanic makeup of Padres crowds was about 5 percent in 1995 , the team estimates . Now that figure is closer to 20 percent . <p> To communicate to those fans , bilingual ushers wear name tags that say " Yo hablo espanol . " Although no one in the Padres front office spoke Spanish four years ago , one in five speaks Spanish now . Furthermore , Spanish classes are offered for those who want to learn . <p> " It 's a sea change in customs and environment for this organization , " Steinberg said . <p> Expansion team efforts <p> Two clubs taking an aggressive approach to Hispanic marketing are newcomers to the world of big-league baseball . The Florida Marlins joined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in their first season of play . In their efforts to assemble a fan base , the teams have courted the sizable Hispanic populations of South Florida and Arizona . <p> " Any marketing research will tell you it 's not enough just to translate your marketing materials into Spanish . You have to get involved in the community 's customs . You have to understand their way of thinking , " said Adolfo Salgueiro , manager of Hispanic marketing for the Marlins . " The Hispanic has a different - how would I put it - they are not of the same mind as many Americans . You have to do things different to get their attention . " <p> The Marlins ' efforts include publishing a free newsletter in Spanish every month . Averaging 20 pages per issue , Marlins Mensual features interviews with Hispanic stars like Livan Hernandez and Edgar Renteria . It also touts team promotions and ticket specials . <p> The Marlins also opened a business office in the Little Havana section of Miami , where team officials meet with community leaders to discuss outreach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uses the office to sell tickets and Marlins merchandise . <p> During every homestand , the Marlins host a Fiesta Latina , which offers live Hispanic music , dancing and food served inside a tent in the stadium parking lot . <p> " Fiesta Latina is totally packed every week , " Salgueiro said . " It 's unbelievable . " <p> Before Saturday home games , the team also hosts parties in the parking lot of a local grocery store - often in a Hispanic neighborhood , but also in other parts of Miami . Several hours before game time , Marlins players show up to sign autographs and give tickets away . <p> Like the Marlins , the Arizona Diamondbacks publish a free , Spanish-language newsletter for its fans . The team also hosts Sabados con los Diamondbacks - Saturday with the Diamondbacks . Like the Domingos Padres , the weekly event features Latin music and mariachis at the stadium . <p> In an effort to develop their own fan base in Mexico , the Diamondbacks are committed to play at least one spring training game in Hermosillo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have an opportunity for a major breakthrough right in their own back yard . <p> " Phoenix has 2.2 million residents , and 28 percent of them are Hispanic , " said Richard Saenz , director of Hispanic marketing for the Diamondbacks . " But what is more interesting is 47 percent of all high school students in Maricopa County are Hispanic . " <p> The Valenzuela effect <p> One of the most popular teams in Mexico is the Los Angeles Dodgers . Much of the loyalty to the Dodgers was created by Fernando Valenzuela , the brilliant pitcher from Mexico who launched a frenzy known as Fernandomania . His performances filled Dodger Stadium with Hispanic fans , some of whom traveled hundreds of miles from Mexico to see El Toro pitch . <p> " Fernando wrote a new chapter for baseball , " said Barry Stockhamer , Dodgers vice president of marketing . " He energized the Hispanic marketplace like no one had before . " <p> Shortly after Moores bought the Padres , San Diego tapped into the aging Valenzuela 's enormous star power by signing him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was Valenzuela who pitched the first game of La Primera Serie in Monterrey . <p> According to an Associated Press account : " It was Valenzuela the 23,699 fans came to see , and they hung on the 35-year-old left-hander 's every move . They crowded the bullpen rails to watch him warm up , and chanted ' Toro ! Toro ! ' - ' Bull ' in Spanish - when he was introduced to a standing ovation . " <p> Despite having some great moments with the Padres - he won the game in Monterrey - Valenzuela and Fernandomania always will be linked with the Dodgers . With that kind of tradition of success with Hispanic fans , the Dodgers do n't feel like they have to stage weekly fiestas or trumpet their overtures to the Hispanic people of Southern California . <p> " Our efforts are out in the community , making the tickets as convenient as possible . We support community programs in East L.A. , " Stockhamer said . <p> With a hint of dismissiveness for the upstarts of Hispanic marketing , he added , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Some observers say the Dodgers are letting a lot of innovative thinking by the Padres , Marlins and Diamondbacks pass them by . But the Dodgers ' approach is not unlike that taken by many other teams , including the Houston Astros . <p> Astros more low-key <p> Like the Dodgers , the Astros have opted against splashy Domingos Padres and Sabados con los Diamondbacks affairs . The centerpiece of the Astros ' efforts to appeal to Hispanic customers is the Spanish-language radio broadcast of its games on KXYZ-AM . Beyond that , the Astros hope to reach the Hispanic audience with a broad-based marketing program that targets families and young people of all ethnic backgrounds . <p> " Over the past 10 years , we have tried segment marketing to different groups . It was good from a PR standpoint , but we thought it was too fragmented to be effective , " said Pam Gardner , vice president of Astros marketing . " So we regrouped and tried a more unified approach . " <p> Saying the promotion was not especially effective , the Astros dropped Tejano Tuesdays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the park and some price discounts on tickets . The Astros have stuck with grass-roots community programs that fix up inner-city baseball fields and provide free baseball equipment for underprivileged kids . <p> The Astros also have a few new things in the works that could help build a bigger Hispanic fan base . They are negotiating to tap into a Mexican radio network that would broadcast Astros games to listeners in 16 Mexican cities . <p> " We could do something splashy like Tejano Tuesday again , but that 's not what we are about , " Gardner said . " We want to approach this group without putting mariachis in front of the park and saying , ' Look at what we are doing . ' " <p> But a local expert in Hispanic marketing says something splashy is precisely what 's needed in Houston . <p> " In a market where there are 1 million Hispanic residents , the Astros do n't do nearly enough , " said Alex Lopez Negrete , president of the city 's largest Hispanic-owned advertising agency . " They must invite us in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promotional use of Latin American players and coaches - pitcher Jose Lima has gained rapid popularity , outfielder Moises Alou is an All-Star and coach Jose Cruz is still revered from his days as a star outfielder - could give the team a boost at the gate . <p> The Astros also have a stable of talented young players , particularly from the team 's highly successful training camp in Venezuela . Potential stars such as outfielder Richard Hidalgo could prove to be important marketing assets in years to come . <p> Buying power is great <p> The rewards of finding a winning strategy could be substantial . According to a new survey released by Market Study International , the city 's Hispanic population exceeds 1 million people , making it the largest in Texas and the fourth-largest nationwide . The group wields an estimated $ 8 billion in consumer buying power . The average household income for Houston 's Hispanics is $ 38,000 , in contrast with the impoverished image some have of the Hispanic community . <p> " Hispanic consumers are a market segment no business can afford to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> While there are solid business reasons for marketing baseball to the Hispanic community , Moores sees reasons that transcend dollars and cents . <p> " This almost is a moral issue , " Moores said . " I am absolutely convinced Hispanics get the short end of the stick in our society . . . . Hispanics are a quiet minority . They do n't demand attention . But just because they are silent , it does n't mean they are n't interested . " <p> Other San Diegans believe the Padres ' efforts are about more than just baseball . <p> " Domingos Padres is a shared cultural experience , " said Michael Hernandez , who works for Radio Latina in San Diego . " It brings both sides of the border together , and that 's a good thing for San Diego . "
