The sweep , when it came last month , was swift and thorough . Dozens of Italian customs officers fanned out across the country and began pounding on doors in Milan , Bologna , Pisa and Pesaro . Their target : a loose alliance of computer bulletin-board operators suspected of trafficking in stolen software . By last week , according to unofficial reports , the Italian police had shut down more than 60 computer bulletin boards and seized 120 computers , dozens of modems and more than 60,000 floppy disks . In their zeal , say the suspects , some officers of the Guardia di Finanza grabbed anything even remotely high-tech , including audiotapes , telephone-answering machines and multiplug electrical outlets . <P> It was the most dramatic move yet in a determined  --  and some say increasingly desperate  --  effort by governments around the world to curb the spread of software piracy . The unauthorized copying of computer programs by American businesses alone deprived software publishers of $1.6 billion last year , a figure that swells to nearly $7.5 billion when overseas markets are included . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Ken Wasch , head of the U.S. Software Publishers Association . <P> But government actions to stem the losses may be causing more problems than they solve . The Italian campaign , which began just as the newly elected right- wing government of media tycoon Silvio Berlusconi took office , hit largely left-leaning bulletin boards . And it is seen by some Italians as an ill- disguised attempt to suppress free speech on a troublesome new medium . In the U.S. a widely publicized federal case against a college student accused of operating a pirate bulletin board may backfire if , as expected , a judge rules that the charges filed against the student do not fit the crime . The underlying difficulty , say copyright experts , comes from trying to guard intangible electronic " property " using laws that were crafted with printing- press technology in mind . <P> At first glance , software piracy seems no different from that of any other copyrighted material . Chinese factories stamp out copies of American music CDs by the millions . Pirated American movies regularly appear in Asia and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The objects that sometimes crawl across the bottom of the screen turn out on close inspection to be the heads of theater patrons inadvertently videotaped by the bootleggers . ) <P> But software is not really like other intellectual property . Books and videotapes can be copied only by processes that are relatively time consuming and expensive , and the product is never quite as good as the original . Software , on the other hand , is easily duplicated , and the result is not a scratchy second-generation copy but a perfect working program . <P> The rapid growth of electronic networks only compounds the problem , for it allows anyone with a computer and a modem to distribute software silently and instantaneously . More than 90 countries around the world are already connected to the Internet , a global network that reaches an estimated 25 million computer users .
