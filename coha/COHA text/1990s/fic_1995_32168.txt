It was an odd-looking vine . Dusky variegated leaves hunkered against a stem that wound in a stranglehold around the smooth trunk of a balsam fir . Sap drooled down the wounded bark , and dry limbs slumped , making it look as if the tree were trying to voice a moan into the cool , damp morning air . Pods stuck out from the vine here and there along its length , almost seeming to look warily about for witnesses . It was the smell that had first caught his attention , a smell like the decomposition of something that had been wholly unsavory even in life . Richard combed his fingers through his thick hair as his mind lifted out of the fog of despair , coming into focus upon seeing the vine . He scanned for others , but saw none . Everything else looked normal . The maples of the upper Ven Forest were already tinged with crimson , proudly showing off their new mantle in the light breeze . With nights getting colder , it would n't be long before their cousins down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being the last to surrender to the season , still stoically wore their dark green coats . Having spent most his life in the woods , Richard knew all the plants  --  if not by name , by sight . From when Richard was very small , his friend Zedd had taken him along , hunting for special herbs . He had shown Richard which ones to look for , where they grew and why , and put names to everything they saw . Many times they just talked , the old man always treating him as an equal , asking as much as he answered . Zedd had sparked Richard 's hunger to learn , to know . This vine , though , he had seen only once before , and it was n't in the woods . He had found a sprig of it at his father 's house , in the blue clay jar Richard had made when he was a boy . His father had been a trader and had traveled often , looking for the chance exotic or rare item . People of means had often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned up . It seemed to be the looking , more than the finding , that he had liked , as he had always been happy to part with his latest discovery so he could be off after the next . From a young age , Richard had liked to spend time with Zedd while his father was away . Richard 's brother , Michael , was a few years older , and having no interest in the woods , or Zedd 's rambling lectures , preferred to spend his time with people of means . About five years before , Richard had moved away to live on his own , but he often stopped by his father 's home , unlike Michael , who was always busy and rarely had time to visit . If his father had gone away , he would leave Richard a message in the blue jar telling him the latest news , some gossip , or of some sight he had seen . On the day three weeks before when Michael had come and told him their father had been murdered , Richard had gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insistence that there was no reason to go , nothing he could do . Richard had long since passed the age when he did as his brother said . Wanting to spare him , the people there did n't let him see the body . But still , he saw the big , sickening splashes and puddles of blood , brown and dry across the plank floor . When Richard came close , voices fell silent , except to offer sympathy , which only deepened the riving pain . Yet he had heard them talking , in hushed tones , of the stories and the wild rumors of things come out of the boundary . Of magic . Richard was shocked at the way his father 's small home had been torn apart , as if a storm had been turned loose inside . Only a few things were left untouched . The blue message jar still sat on the shelf , and inside he found the sprig of vine . It was still in his pocket now . What his father meant him to know from it , he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even though he still had his brother , he felt abandoned . That he was grown into manhood offered him no sanctuary from the forlorn feeling of being orphaned and alone in the world , a feeling he had known before , when he was young and his mother died . Even though his father had often been away , sometimes for weeks , Richard had always known he was somewhere , and would be back . Now he would never be back . Michael would n't let him have anything to do with the search for the killer . He said he had the best trackers in the army looking and he wanted Richard to stay out of it , for his own good . So Richard simply did n't show the vine to Michael , and went off alone every day , searching for the vine . For three weeks he walked the trails of the Hartland Woods , every trail , even the ones few others knew of , but he never saw it . Finally , against his better judgment , he gave in to the whispers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forest , close to the boundary . The whispers haunted him with the feeling that he somehow knew something of why his father had been murdered . They teased at him , tantalized him with thoughts just out of reach , and laughed at him for not seeing it . Richard lectured himself that it was his grief playing tricks , not something real . He had thought that when he found the vine it would give him some sort of answer . Now that he had , he did n't know what to think . The whispers had stopped teasing him , but now they brooded . He knew it was just his own mind thinking , and he told himself to stop trying to give the whispers a life of their own . Zedd had taught him better than that . Richard looked up at the big fir tree in its agony of death . He thought again of his father 's death . The vine had been there . Now the vine was killing this tree ; it could n't be anything good . Though he could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to let the vine preside over another death . Gripping it firmly , he pulled , and with powerful muscles ripped the sinewy tendrils away from the tree . That 's when the vine bit him . One of the pods struck out and hit the back of his left hand , causing him to jump back in pain and surprise . Inspecting the small wound , he found something like a thorn embedded in the meat of the gash . The matter was decided . The vine was trouble . He reached for his knife to dig out the thorn , but the knife was n't there . At first surprised , he realized why and reprimanded himself for allowing his depression to cause him to forget something as basic as taking his knife with him into the woods . Using his fingernails , he tried to pull out the thorn . To his rising concern , the thorn , as if alive , wiggled itself in deeper . He dragged his thumbnail across the wound , trying to snag the thorn out . The more he dug , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through him as he tore at the wound , making it bigger , so he stopped . The thorn had disappeared into the oozing blood . Looking about , Richard spotted the purplish red autumn leaves of a small nannyberry tree , laden with its crop of dark blue berries . Beneath the tree , nestled in the crook of a root , he found what he sought : an aum plant . Relieved , he carefully snapped off the tender stem near its base , and gently squeezed the sticky , clear liquid onto the bite . He gave a smile to old Zedd for teaching him how the aum plant made wounds heal faster . The soft fuzzy leaves always made Richard think of Zedd . The juice of the aum numbed the sting , but not his worry over being unable to remove the thorn . He could feel it wriggling still deeper into his flesh . Richard squatted down and poked a hole in the ground with his finger , placed the aum in it , and fixed moss about the stem so it might regrow itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richard looked up , flinching as a dark shadow swept over the ground , leaping across limbs and leaves . There was a rushing , whistling sound in the air overhead . The size of the shadow was frightening . Birds burst from cover in the trees , giving alarm calls as they scattered in all directions . Richard peered up , searching through the gaps in the canopy of green and gold , trying to see the shadow 's source . For an instant , he saw something big . Big , and red . He could n't imagine what it could be , but the memory of the rumors and stories of things coming out of the boundary flooded back into his mind , making him go cold to the bone . The vine was trouble , he thought again ; this thing in the sky could be no less . He remembered what people always said , " Trouble sires three children , " and knew immediately that he did n't want to meet the third child . Discounting his fears , he started running . Just idle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to think of what could be that big , that big and red . It was impossible ; there was nothing that flew that was that large . Maybe it was a cloud , or a trick of the light . But he could n't fool himself : it was no cloud . Looking up as he ran , trying for another glimpse , he headed for the path that skirted the hillside . Richard knew that the ground dropped off sharply on the other side of the trail , and he would be able to get an unobstructed view of the sky . Tree branches wet with rain from the night before slapped at his face as he ran through the forest , jumping fallen trees and small rocky streams . Brush snatched at his pant legs . Dappled swatches of sunlight teased him to look up but denied him the view he needed . His breath was fast , ragged , sweat ran cold against his face , and he could feel his heart pounding as he ran carelessly down the hillside . At last he stumbled out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Searching the sky , he spotted the thing , far away and too small for him to tell what it was , but he thought it had wings . He squinted against the blue brightness of the sky , shielded his eyes with his hand , trying to see for sure if there were wings moving . It slipped behind a hill and was gone . He had n't even been able to tell if it really was red . Winded , Richard slumped down on a granite boulder at the side of the trail , absently snapping off dead twigs from a sapling beside him while he stared down at Trunt Lake below . Maybe he should go tell Michael what had happened , tell him about the vine and the red thing in the sky . He knew Michael would laugh at the last part . He had laughed at the same stories himself . No , Michael would only be angry with him for being up near the boundary , and for going against his orders to stay out of the search for the murderer . He knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be nagging him . Now that he was grown , he could laugh off his brother 's constant instructions , though he still had to endure the looks of displeasure . Richard snapped off another twig and in frustration threw it at a flat rock . He decided he should n't feel singled out . After all , Michael was always telling everyone what to do , even their father . He pushed his harsh judgments of his brother aside ; today was a big day for Michael . Today he was accepting the position of First Councilor . He would be in charge of everything now , not just the town of Hartland anymore , but all the towns and villages of Westland , even the country people . Responsible for everything and everyone . Michael deserved Richard 's support , he needed it ; Michael had lost a father , too . That afternoon there was to be a ceremony and big celebration at Michael 's house . Important people were going to be there , come from the farthest reaches of Westland . Richard was supposed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of good food . He realized he was famished . While he sat and thought , he scanned the opposite side of Trunt Lake , far below . From this height the clear water revealed alternating patches of rocky bottom and green weed around the deep holes . At the edge of the water , Hawkers Trail knitted in and out of the trees , in some places open to view , in some places hidden . Richard had been on that part of the trail many times . In the spring it was wet and soggy down by the lake , but this late in the year it would be dry . In areas farther north and south , as the trail wound its way through the high Ven Forests , it passed uncomfortably close to the boundary . Because of that , most travelers avoided it , choosing instead the trails of the Hartland Woods . Richard was a woods guide , and led travelers safely through the Hartland forests . Most were traveling dignitaries wanting the prestige of a local guide more than they wanted direction . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it had been , he stared hard at the spot on the far side of the lake . When he saw it again , on the path , where it passed behind a thin veil of trees , there was no doubt : it was a person . Maybe it was his friend Chase . Who else but a boundary warden would be wandering around up here ? He hopped down off the rock , tossing the twigs aside , and took a few steps forward . The figure followed the path into the open , at the edge of the lake . It was n't Chase ; it was a woman . A woman in a dress . What woman would be walking around this far out in the Ven Forest , in a dress ? Richard watched her making her way along the lakeshore , disappearing and reappearing with the path . She did n't seem to be in a hurry , but she was n't strolling slowly either . Rather , she moved at the measured pace of an experienced traveler . That made sense ; no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his attention . Richard 's eyes searched the shade and shadows . Behind her , there were others . Three , no , four men , in hooded forest cloaks , following her , but hanging back some distance . They moved with stealth , from tree to rock to tree . Looking . Waiting . Moving . Richard straightened , his eyes wide , his attention riveted . They were stalking her . He knew immediately : this was the third child of trouble .
