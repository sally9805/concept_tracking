<p> Last month , in a couple of columns , Dr. Gridlock looked at our transportation future . It 's bleak . No new bridges over the Potomac River in 30 years and none planned ; no significant Beltway improvements or new Metro rail lines in the pipeline ; no funding , or even consensus support , for a Washington bypass on the east or west or for remedies for the notorious Woodrow Wilson Bridge bottleneck . Add to that 65 percent more traffic projected by 2020 , but only 20 percent more road capacity . Getting that squeezed feeling ? <p> More readers have proposals . Ronald F. Kirby , chief transportation planner for the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments and the regional Transportation Planning Board , helps me answer some of these letters . <p> Encourage Short Commutes <p> Dear Dr. Gridlock : <p> Yes , the future looks congested , but of all the alternatives you mentioned in your Sept. 1 column  --  bridges , bypasses , Metrorail , tolls  --  you left out my favorite : <p> Governments could give tax breaks to people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small percentage reduction in marathon commutes , like Germantown to Alexandria , or Reston to Burtonsville , would help the Beltway . <p> An accompanying public service campaign might cause enough people to reconsider where they choose to live . It might be cheaper than the alternatives . <p> CATHY BRYAN JOHNSON <p> Silver Spring <p> The concept sounds good . However , in addition to the loss of revenue , the administrative cost of processing claims and certifying that people actually live where they say they do ( this would have to be done on a continuing basis ) might make this proposal unworkable . I 'd like to hear details . <p> Send Ferries to the Rescue <p> Dear Dr. Gridlock : <p> Your column on our overstressed bridges makes me wonder : Why not have ferries across the Potomac or Anacostia rivers ? Ferries could carry cars across the river , as is done in other cities , thus reducing bridge traffic . <p> Implementing such a system would surely cause less environmental disruption than building new bridges , and thus perhaps be more politically palatable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why not ? <p> KEN SANDLER <p> Arlington <p> Several studies have been conducted by the federal government , Maryland and COG . The conclusion : Ferries take too long to move people . " You can afford to wait a long time on the Wilson Bridge rather than drive down to a ferry , wait for it , load your car , cross and unload on the other side , " Kirby said . One study showed that a trip up the Potomac River from Cherry Hill in Prince William County to the Maine Avenue waterfront would take 12 minutes longer by ferry and the fare would be about the same as charged by Virginia Rail Express . <p> However , Kirby said , COG is studying the possible use of catamarans to ferry people ( not cars ) short distances , such as from the Pentagon to Maine Avenue or Georgetown . Cars would be left in park-and-ride lots . Still , a very small number of commuters would be served . " It would n't make a dent in the Wilson Bridge traffic , " Kirby said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where ferries offer an alternative that makes a substantial difference in traffic congestion ? <p> A Western Passage and a Flyover <p> Dear Dr. Gridlock : <p> The Eastern Bypass , the Western Bypass . The bridge is falling down . We ca n't widen the bridge . It costs too much to do anything . Time is running out . Boy are we in a quandary ! <p> Here are two proposals : <p> ( 1 ) Direct all through truck traffic to travel the western portion of the Beltway to relieve the problem over the Wilson Bridge . <p> ( 2 ) Get the District of Columbia to contribute to the solution to this problem . Remember I-95 originally was planned to go through the District , but was rerouted around the Beltway . Maryland and Virginia have suffered because of this . An elevated or direct road with no stops in the District constructed from I-95 at the north Beltway to I-95 at the south Beltway would cut down truck travel , save gas and take traffic off the local roads . In the long run , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> New Carrollton <p> ( 1 ) Kirby noted that the western side of the Beltway is already the most heavily traveled side , particularly sections through Montgomery County and , in Virginia , between the Dulles Toll Road and Interstate 66 . The American Legion Bridge carries more traffic than the Woodrow Wilson Bridge ( it also has more capacity , 10 lanes to six ) , and is a mess at rush hour . Putting all the through truck traffic on the heaviest traveled side probably would n't work . <p> ( 2 ) " Routing I-95 through the city was an issue fought many years ago ; I do n't think there is any way to revisit that , " Kirby said . " However , there is a modern-day version of that battle going on . The District badly wants to build the Barney Circle connector , which would link the two freeways on either side of the Anacostia River via a new bridge just north of the Sousa Bridge . There are some environmental concerns . That might be one to get involved in . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ride Metrorail <p> Dear Dr. Gridlock : <p> When a man 's arteries become clogged , adding new arteries is not an option . If it were , he would probably continue eating fat and adding arteries , as stupid as that sounds . <p> The suggestion that what are needed are new roads and bridges is about as intelligent as continuing to eat fat and somehow add arteries when we are already bloated . What we need are FEWER CARS on the road ( less fat ! ) . <p> There is a way : Make them much more expensive to operate  --  together with cheap , even free , Metrorail service . <p> We need a greatly expanded rapid transit system reaching out into all the nooks and crannies of this area 's exploded development , supported by perimeter parking lots . <p> Financing could come from much higher gasoline taxes , a stiff auto tax ( especially for the second or third car owned ) , tolls on all major roads and redirection of funds now marked for more road building . The bumper-to-bumper experience now , plus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternative should persuade a lot of drivers to switch to public transportation . <p> Building and widening roads ad nauseam has n't worked . Should n't a new approach be tried ? <p> WILLIAM P. RISSO <p> Great Falls <p> " Free or low-cost Metro fares is an idea that 's been around for decades , " Kirby said . " The studies show it 's a very expensive way to get ridership . The first thing you do is give free passes to all those now using the system , so you have to make up that money . The studies show you 're better off putting money into better service , such as more frequency . People will pay for better service . " <p> Metro is already operating at a loss and must be subsidized by local governments , which sometimes balk at the ever-increasing amounts they have to pay . We already have a gasoline tax , state and federal , for transportation improvements . I wonder how much more would be acceptable . Stiff taxes for auto ownership would seem to punish everyone , no matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road use during peak periods to diminish demand ( more on that later ) . Please read on . <p> The Case for Do Nothing <p> Dear Dr. Gridlock : <p> More bridges across the Potomac will only generate more traffic and shift congestion to new locations . The in-and-out-nature of commuting  --  toward and away from Washington  --  can best be solved by Metrorail . <p> Commuters wo n't switch to mass transit as long as cars are faster and parking is financially feasible . Build more bridges and roads first and new Metrorail lines NEVER become feasible . <p> You 're right that we can not pave our way out of gridlock . That being the case , the current plan of doing nothing is the BEST option . <p> MALCOLM H. CHURCHILL <p> Washington <p> Well , doing nothing is what we 're doing well now . A few things are being looked at , but not with any consensus . No significant improvements are funded . But I do n't believe that 's the best way to go . More and more traffic is coming , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for our transportation does not lie in Metro improvements to in-and-out trips between Washington and the suburbs . Washington is steadily becoming less important to commuters . It is losing population . With a comparatively high crime rate and tax burden , people are leaving , and job growth is diminished . The future is in the suburbs , particularly outside the Beltway . <p> Look at these 2020 job and population growth projections from Kirby : <p> For the central core ( the District , Arlington and Alexandria ) , jobs up 21 percent , population up only 7 percent . <p> For the inner suburbs ( Montgomery , Prince George 's and Fairfax counties ) , jobs up 57 percent and population up 37 percent . <p> For the outer suburbs ( Loudoun , Prince William , Stafford , Frederick , Charles and Calvert Counties ) , jobs up 120 percent and population up 99 percent . <p> By 2020 , Fairfax County alone is projected to have twice as many people ( 1.2 million ) as the District . " Jobs are what is attracting traffic , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had stuck to the original " wedges and corridors " concept that would have clustered suburban development around Metrorail stations . Instead we got suburban sprawl . Malls and strip shopping centers have replaced cities and towns , and they are serviced with big parking lots . <p> I do n't think you can expand Metrorail to all the nooks and crannies of this area . Too expensive . The cost to build a mile of Metrorail ( surface rail , factoring in stations ) is about twice as much ( $ 25 million ) as building four lanes of interstate highway , and Metro does n't offer the crossing connecting points . <p> A reasonable expansion of Metro ought to be considered . Possible extensions : the Orange Line from Vienna to Centreville ; the Red Line from Shady Grove to Frederick ; the Blue Line from Addison Road to Largo and Bowie ; the Orange Line from East Falls Church to Dulles International Airport . <p> We badly need more parking at Metrorail stations . It will cost a lot less in the suburbs  --  and is a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Metro rather than vice versa . This is not to say Metro 's rail and bus services are n't a vital component of our transportation future . They already take 260,000 people out of cars every day . <p> A Legacy of Poor Planning <p> Dear Dr. Gridlock : <p> The chickens have come home to roost . <p> Transportation planners in this area planted a large number of acorns over the last four or five decades , and now they seem surprised to find oak trees . <p> Some of these acorns include the deliberate dismantling of an efficient light rail system in the 1950s , building new streets without sidewalks and erecting office buildings in rural fields miles from any bus line . <p> Perhaps the biggest acorn of all is the tendency for politicians to regard road funding as an " investment , " while transit funding is a " subsidy . " <p> So what did our fearless leaders expect from their acorns in a wheat field ? <p> Congratulations , planners . <p> THOMAS E. HOFFMAN JR . <p> Rockville <p> Curb Population Growth <p> Dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the obvious but apparently taboo question . We need such-and-such more capacity to move 41 percent more people by 2020 ; but why on earth do we need the extra people ? <p> The question almost answers itself : We do n't . We could , however , easily design tax and other incentives to discourage population growth through voluntary means , yet we continue to treat it like a force of nature as inescapable as winter blizzards . <p> Why not raise consciousness to see that this underlying problem can and must be stopped ? The problem has a name  --  overpopulation  --  and it is time to recognize that it applies to us , not just to those people in the Third World . <p> DARYL P. DOMNING <p> Professor , Department of Anatomy , <p> Howard University <p> " Our traffic growth comes from migration to this area , not just from people born in this area . " Kirby said . " People come here because of the market and because of job opportunities . We are a magnet for this and will continue to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be coming here for the next 20 to 30 years are already alive , and heading this way . " <p> Population growth nationally is relatively low . Whether there should be a tax incentive to lower it further is a national issue that would need a lot more debate . <p> Make Better Use of Road Capacity <p> Dear Dr. Gridlock : <p> At long last someone in the Washington media has shown a light on the great , dark secret regarding the traditional pave-more approach to transportation : It does n't work . Road building has n't brought us relief from traffic congestion so far , and it never will . <p> By the year 2020 , the region plans to spend $ 12.6 billion on major road projects . Yet official forecasts predict congestion levels will rise an astounding 700 percent by 2020 . Two-thirds of all road travel will experience stop-and-go conditions . <p> If paving over the Washington region wo n't work , what will ? This is the other best-kept secret in the transportation world : transportation demand management , or TDM for short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capacity through more paving , TDM frees up existing road capacity by reducing traffic . Even traffic reductions as small as 15 percent can unclog a congested road . <p> The choice for the region is clear . We can keep traffic moving with TDM or guarantee region-wide gridlock with a single-minded pursuit of road building . You could provide a great service to your readers by informing them of this fork in the road . <p> GEORGE J. MAURER <p> Environmental Planner , <p> Chesapeake Bay Foundation <p> TDM in this area , as explained by Kirby , would mean that motorists might pay more to use roads during peak travel times . This would be done through a scanning device that reads a fare card affixed to the windshield ( there would be no toll booths ) . The object would be to spread out demand over a longer period of time , thus reducing congestion , and possibly prompt drivers to join car pools , take mass transit or move closer to their jobs . <p> The federal government wants to fund a test of this . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternatives , including more mass transit , more roads , more bridges , more parking at Metro stations , catamarans , car pools , HOV lanes , demand management , the whole package . <p> " It 's a lot of little things glued together that will make our transportation system work , Kirby said . " Everybody 's got a little of the answer , but each person thinks his proposal is the whole answer , and that 's why we do n't get anywhere . We need a consensus that we need a little of everything here , and if we do , we might develop a plan that will help a lot .
