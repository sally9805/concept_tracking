<p> Inspectors are finding overcharges by price scanners in one-quarter of their visits to Chicago area stores , according to city and state data analyzed by the Chicago Sun-Times . <p> Chicago 's inspection program has found scanned prices higher than the advertised price in 24 percent of its store visits since 1993 . State inspectors , who monitor suburban stores , have found overcharges in 26 percent of the stores checked during the same period  --  and in 35 percent of the stores inspected in suburban Cook County . <p> While overcharges are more common at suburban stores , inspections are far less frequent . State inspectors have done only one scanner check in all of the suburbs so far this year and have done just 185 since 1993 , even though only a handful of suburbs do their own checking . <p> Chicago , meanwhile , has conducted an aggressive inspection program , making annual checks of all 434 city stores that use scanners . <p> The Sun-Times findings show that a shopper can expect to run into an overcharge on one of every 71 products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ items in the suburbs . <p> City inspectors check 50 items on each store visit ; in the suburbs , 20 items are checked . <p> The highest number of stores that overcharged were found in suburban Cook and McHenry counties . Thirty-five percent of the stores checked in suburban Cook County showed up with one or more overcharges , while 26 percent of the stores checked in McHenry County showed violations . <p> Only four stores were checked in Lake County , and three had violations . DuPage and Kane counties were almost neck-and-neck , with 19 percent and 18 percent showing violations , respectively . Will County , with eight stores checked , had no overcharges . <p> While the average overcharge at a grocery store is less than the typical price of a candy bar ( about 41 cents in the city compared with 38 cents in the suburbs ) , it is estimated that overcharges cost customers in the Chicago area tens of millions of dollars a year . <p> Nationwide , according to Information Week magazine , scanning overcharges cost consumers $ 2.5 billion a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting worse . The city data show overcharges this year are outpacing the last two years . <p> " I 'm disappointed with some of the stores ' performance this year , " said Caroline Shoenberger , Chicago consumer services commissioner . " If it continues to get worse , we 'll be forced to take more steps . We want companies to make a profit . But we want them to make it fairly . " <p> Both the city and state can fine stores  --  $ 500 for each offense in the city and up to $ 1,000 for each offense elsewhere in the state . The city also can deny the city certification to operate scanners , although it never has taken that step . <p> Officials from the state and city say they suspect most retailers are not out to pad their bottom line . But some experts are n't so sure . <p> " I do n't think it 's a case of intent to defraud , " said Shoenberger . " Walgreens is well-known for its overcharges . It 's not intentional . They know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot to solve it . " <p> Sid Colbrook , chief of the state 's weights and measures bureau , said : " The majority of the problems are on sale items . Retailers are n't using it to cheat customers . You have to look at the number of products they are pulling . You are naturally going to see some problems . " <p> Retailers say they are doing everything in their power to cut down on the problems and that no system is perfect . <p> " No system is 100 percent accurate all the time , " said Walgreens spokesman Michael Polzin . " The vast majority of the time , the problem with prices comes at the store level . By no means are we trying to deceive customers under any circumstance . " Walgreens also does periodic department price checks . <p> But Shoenberger points out that in the city , there are far more overcharges than undercharges . Out of about 360 inspections scanning 18,000 products in the city already this year , only one undercharge came up , compared with 431 overcharges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the suburbs , 61 products resulted in overcharges and 40 came up as undercharges . <p> The city targets mainly sale items , while the state looks at a sampling of sale and full-priced items . <p> Ronald Goodstein , a Wharton Business School professor who has studied price scanning , said he believes that some overcharges are intentional . In many cases nationally , he said , stores are n't correcting the problems even after they 've been fined . <p> " When we did our study , we found that the scanners were doing right . It 's the humans causing the errors , " Goodstein said . " When we set out to do the study , I thought we 'd find that it was oversight . So what I needed to do is find a situation where a store was marking prices back up ( after a sale ) . <p> " When items came back up , there was 100 percent accuracy , which tells me that they make sure they fix the ones that affect the bottom line first . " <p> But other analysts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scanning to pump up profits is too risky for retailers , as well as too time-consuming . <p> " This is not intentional by any means . Retailers have enough to worry about without sitting and figuring out how to cheat a consumer with a scanner , " said Vic Orler , a partner with Andersen Consulting . " A food retailer may have 20,000 to 30,000 items to oversee , with thousands of price changes on any given day . There are a lot of opportunities to make mistakes . " <p> " There is so much competition that if a customer thought you were cheating , they 'd go somewhere else , " said Jim Bakopoulos , who runs Holiday Super Foods on the Northwest Side . " We correct our mistakes . We do n't say , ' Get lost . ' " <p> The city 's biggest retail chains say they are doing everything possible to keep accuracy rates near 100 percent . Jewel and Dominick 's , the city 's two biggest supermarket chains , will offer a customer an item free  --  except liquor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelf price . State law prohibits retailers from dispensing liquor or tobacco products at no charge . <p> Jewel has a scanning coordinator in each store and does " commodity checks " where it will check prices of products on the shelf of a given section . Walgreens also employs scanning coordinators . <p> The state 's infrequent inspections  --  only four since 1992 in Lake County and only eight in Will County  --  are the result of the weights and measures bureau 's more pressing duties and staff cuts . <p> Colbrook , the bureau 's chief , said his agency puts a higher priority on checking food safety and in-store scales . The department also has been the victim of budget cuts that resulted in a 10 percent cut in field staff over the last five years . <p> Colbrook said his department expects to step up its scanning investigations over the next 12 months . And even now , he said , consumers are able to protect themselves from scanning overcharges . <p> " Customers do have some instant recourse because they can check with their store receipt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SCHOOL IN ROME nearly 30 years ago , my primitive Italian made it tough to communicate with classmates , instructors , and the local populace . I misunderstood a lot of things , and every time I opened my mouth , I made what the Romans called " a sack of mistakes . " As anyone in a language immersion program can tell you , it 's lonely and frustrating not to be able to tell people what you are thinking and feeling , to be reduced to a handful of guidebook phrases that can help you find the bathroom and figure out the bus schedule but never let you express who you are and what is going on for you in this wonderful but foreign place . To compensate for my weak vocabulary , I turned up the volume on nonverbal communications . I put more stress on tone and pitch , emphasizing my point with dramatic stress . My facial gestures became more intense and manic , I started talking more and more with my hands - pointing , waving , and gesticulating like a Roman - and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when my Italian improved , I continued to rely on pitch , expression , and gesture to make myself understood , to find a rich , full voice for the person held captive by my tiny vocabulary . As it turns out , having to learn to " speak " with pitch , expression , and gesture made me a better communicator in Italian and English , and helped me become a better lecturer in the classroom and speaker on the road . The years in Rome trained me to use a " broad bandwidth " when communicating with my students and authences - not just to inform them but to engage and converse with them . I WAS REMINDED OF THIS EXPERIENCE BY A COUPLE OF RECENT articles about the wonders and woes of e-mail and other forms of digital communication . The authors of these pieces agreed that e-mail , instant messaging , blogging , discussion boards , and chat rooms are replacing the phone and face-to-face conversations for a lot of people , particularly at work and among adolescents . They also agreed that e-mails are wonderful at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short messages , files , and photos that used to be sent by snail mail , courier , or fax now arrive in our e-mail box at the press of a key . And e-mails are great for announcements that need to be broadcast to large and small groups , letting us know about an upcoming meeting or party , warning us about deteriorating weather or traffic for the commute home . Information we used to get in memos or phone messages sent out to everybody in our division now comes with the light " ping " of an incoming e-mail . Nice . But while e-mail makes communicating a lot easier , it makes miscommunicating a good deal easier , too . Indeed , people are much more likely to misunderstand or misinterpret an e-mail message than a phone or face-to-face conversation . And studies show that those sending e-mails are more likely to lie than those calling us on the phone or dropping into our cubicle for a chat . The truth is that e-mail messages that do such a good job at downloading information and broadcasting events should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job performance , negotiate conflicts , or replace face-to-face conversation . THE MAJOR LIMITATION OF E-MAILS IS THEIR " narrow bandwidth . " These text messages have been stripped of the tonal and nonverbal cues that provide a context and meaning for our communications . On the phone we catch a person 's tone and pitch , hear their pauses and pacing and stress , can usually tell if they are angry , happy , or even ironic . Face-to-face we see their eyes , their expression , and their body language ; helping us decipher if they are engaged , bored , or annoyed . All of these cues enrich and correct our understanding of what someone is " saying " with their words , keeping us on the right track , preventing us from major communication gaffes . So you can see why an e-mail stripped of these extra channels would be so easy to misinterpret . These same cues also carry much of the emotional content of our communications , expressing how we feel about the topic being discussed and- often enough- about the person we are communicating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " lyrics " of our spoken or written words express our feelings and judgments and make us more or less accessible to our conversational partners . Some experts report that more than 90 percent of human communication takes place in these tonal and nonverbal cues - leaving very little real communication in an e-mail message . As a result , e-mail communications fail to build the trust and rapport between persons that results from face-to-face or even phone conversations . More than 80 percent of face-to-face negotiations are resolved successfully . Less than half of e-mail negotiations end well . Employees criticized by their bosses in e-mail messages are much more likely to suffer loss of self-esteem , and much less likely to understand the context of these messages . And people are much more likely to write angry and destructive things in an e-mail than they would be on the phone or in a face-to-face communication . As far too many co-workers and employees know from painful experience on either side of the " send " button , e-mail can provide something of a " free tirade " zone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ havoc everywhere . MY ITALIAN EXPERIENCE TAUGHT ME THE importance of communication that goes beyond mere words , that embodies our feelings and intentions in our tone , expressions , and gestures . Words are an important but insufficient part of the human communication that builds bridges of trust and rapport among persons , qualities we need to negotiate with and understand one another . E-mail , instant messaging , and text messages are great at some easy and limited forms of communication , but creating and sustaining human communities requires a little face-toface time .
