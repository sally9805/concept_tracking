It took 39 years , but at the age of 74 , Cheddi Jagan finally made it . Long an avowed Marxist , Jagan has been contesting elections in the South American nation of Guyana ( pop . 751,000 ) since 1953 , when it was a British colony . He claims to have won several but says he was kept from serving out his mandates by British or American CIA machinations or by vote fraud . Last week he won yet another vote , and this time the loser , President Desmond Hoyte , urged Guyanans to accept the result and allow Jagan , who now supports free-market policies , to become head of state at last .
