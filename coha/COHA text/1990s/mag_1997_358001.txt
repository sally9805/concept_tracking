The world as we knew it has changed forever , and the American Century looks to conclude with a huge party , a cancan line of irrepressible bankers and impossibly rich computer nerds dancing on the grave of the business cycle , while politicians of all kinds sing the praises of a new economy that might let them be re-elected forever and ever , as long as people keep voting their pocketbook . So now what ? <P> In real life , the big , bright , global , wired economy means that offices in Washington that once skimped on holiday decorations have hired a singing harpist for the lobby . There are 50 kinds of mustard at the supermarket , and at the Tops in Buffalo , N.Y. , sales of shiitake mushrooms have doubled this year . Clinique is marketing a perfume called Happy , and Levi Strauss sells custom-fit riveted jeans based on customers ' computer-detailed specifications . The youngest donors ever to endow a chair at Stanford are the founders of Internet browser Yahoo !  --  even the chair comes with an exclamation point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are so rich , how come we 're not happy ? The marketers and sociologists whose job it is to measure consumer fears and lusts find that people are still wary of this crunchy economy . If there is such a thing as a national mood , it contradicts itself so much that even the pollsters are confused . " The country is just euphoric , " says G.O.P. pollster Robert Teeter ; his latest figures show that 78% of Americans are not worried about their job security . " There is not a lot of euphoria out there , " says Tom Smith of the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago , whose survey finds that job satisfaction , financial satisfaction and overall happiness are all lower now than the average for the past 20 years . <P> But Americans do n't listen to pollsters and economists . They listen to neighbors , to friends , to family ; they look at their own situation and say yes , we have a little more money , but new cars are expensive , and while microwaves may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Even those who say they 're doing O.K. now think that other people are losing ground , " says Susan Mitchell , author of The Official Guide to American Attitudes . " They all know people who were laid off . Even if it was distant cousin Billy Bob , just knowing someone who was laid off shakes your faith . " <P> What 's new about the new economy is that it 's scary all the time , not just in cycles . Globalization , for example , may be essential and inevitable and highly profitable , when free-trade policies push the share of exports and imports from 17% of our economy to nearly 25% over the past 20 years . Last week GM , which has lost market share to the Japanese , produced the first right-hand-drive Cadillac to be sold in Japan . But because the market is global , there is no longer even the illusion of control , of national boundaries , and that 's what really frightens people . Factories in Karachi , Pakistan , can now produce shorts as quickly and cheaply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacturers have hooked up computerized counters to sewing machines so they can monitor how quickly each seamstress joins two pieces of fabric . Not only does that give instant feedback on productivity , but the new , networked plant also cuts down on the number of supervisors on the cutting-room floor .
