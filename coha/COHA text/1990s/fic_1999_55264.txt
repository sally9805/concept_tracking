That day , my birthday , I was heading downtown to my NA meeting , my home group ; " Blast of Recovery " was the theme , something I could relate to , the " blast " part , anyway . I like to go downtown . My city is shaped like a wagon wheel , spinning ; going nowhere except around ; the center holds it together with its dead weight . This is my home , the forest of buildings , then the swath of the street . <p> I sat in the back of the bus next to the window , the metal of my knife cool against my shin . I pressed my face to the glass . <p> The man next to me wanted to sell me genuine gold chains , then crack . He touched my leg . I turned to look at him . He was wearing a wool cap , even though it was unseasonably hot . It was mustard yellow . The whites of his eyes were n't white . " Yo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around his mouth . He opened his bag , fingered the chains . I shook my head no . <p> " Yo , you ai n't be no Five-O , right ? " <p> I rolled my eyes . <p> " Cause , baby , I feel like I seen you before . " <p> I kept my mouth in a flat line . " Today 's my birthday , " I said , rubbing my knife with my foot . <p> He squinted his eyes and made his decision . " Your birfday ? " He slapped my arm . " Go , girl . Happy birfday ! Well , you know , what else I got here be some good rock , too , baby . I got hold of some exclusive shit today . " He palmed some glassine bags . His hand was rough and dry , his lifeline covered up . I felt my mouth water .

Everything recedes . You hold your breath tight and never want to exhale again . Your head kicks back , sometimes you hear bells ringing . There is no past , no future . Your brain is bathed in dopamine . The taste is something you never forget . <p> " Naw , man , " I said . " I 'm off the pipe . " I hugged myself and shivered ; then I turned away . <p> " Okay , okay , that 's cool , that 's cool . You all right , " he said , palms up , crack repocketed . <p> I looked out the window , every line brightened by the rush of adrenaline , trying to swallow the taste . I looked through a dim reflection of myself on the glass , through my hungry face , my flat eyes . That 's when I thought I saw him . The little hairs on my arms , legs , the back of my neck stood up . My nipples hardened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that must have been what I saw . I had n't seen him in what , more than twenty-five years ? And never in the light . I knew it could n't really be him . Still . Still . The same mangy , curly brown hair down the back . The bone-skinny , stringy-muscled body in a too-tight faded T-shirt . Jeans slung around his hips ; he had no ass , just a baggy spot where it should have been . Negative space . They called him Butt . His shoulders hunched , he was darting through the crowd . A cigarette hanging out of his mouth at an angle . <p> I jumped up as the bus screeched to a stop  --  so loud  --  and got off . Gravity fattened with the wave of heat at the door . Everything closed in ; it was hard to breathe . This was a shitty part of town , an old neighborhood shopping district gone down . The smells of fried lake trout , rotting crab shells , fouled bodies , someone 's sweet perfume , hung in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unsympathetic . Its light was harsh ; I 'd forgotten my sunglasses . The trash lay dejected on the sidewalk . <p> I looked north up the street . He should have come sauntering along anytime , like someone slipping out of a R. Crumb comic . The bus exhaled its filthy breath and rumbled off . I waited and watched ; I leaned against a streetlight , but he never showed . Was it a hallucination ? A ghost ? My higher power screwing with me again , juxtaposing Butt against the itch for the crack ? Happy birfday . Right . <p> What was God 's will ? It popped like a punctured balloon . There was a package goods store right there ! My feet walked right through the door . I bought one Ice Lite . My hands were shaking . Outside , I squatted in front of a cheap wig store : pageboys , falls , extensions . I squatted down against the wall to consider the crack , to consider Butt . The brown paper bag rustled as I uncapped the beer and let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit would be kinda nice . It being my day and all . <p> There was some disused land where all the bad kids and strays hung out . I do n't know why it was there . It was overgrown with rhododendrons , azaleas , raspberries , yews , canopied with old oaks , tulip poplars , and pines . When my parents broke up and my mother moved my brother and me into the city from the country , I started slipping away from the confines of our tiny rowhouse , off the noisy block , out of my dense neighborhood , and playing there , because it felt more like home . I was thirteen and I often played with the knife my father had given me , showed me how to use . I made crude creatures out of roots and twigs . " In the pines , in the pines , where the sun never shines ... " I played there at night , skulking at the edges , scouting . <p> There was a big circle of oaks where everyone congregated . At its center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cigarette butts , roaches , broken glass . There was a core group of seven or eight boys that hung there , but on a summer night there might be thirty or forty kids sitting around , drinking , getting high , faces lit unevenly by a fire if it was n't too hot . I 'd watch from the distance , from across a narrow creek , clear water singing , sipping my own beer , stolen from the neighbor 's garage . They got used to me creeping around . " What 's that noise ? " one of them would ask . <p> " Oh , it 's just that crazy little girl , " a voice would return . " Or , maybe a dog ... " <p> As the summer wore on I dared to slip in closer , near enough to hear . I liked to listen to their talk , whittle on a stick , and watch them . When the boys were alone they talked about all the girls they jumped , that and sports , and dope . They wrestled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Each took a turn as my imaginary boyfriend . <p> One night late , I was squatting next to a tree , trying to light a cigarette , when a twig next to me snapped . I froze up , my lighter cocked and burning . A hand touched my arm . I shrugged it off . <p> " Did I scare ya ? I was just playing with ya . " I recognized the voice . " Wanted to see if I could catch you . " It was the one they called Butt . He was the skinny one with the thin face and the long hair and big hands . One of them lost itself in my hair . " You got soft hair , " he whispered . " Hey , I saw ya on the street the other day . You were wearing green shorts and a halter-top . You looked so long and tall , your hair all hanging down . You 're pretty sweet , you know that ? " <p> I pulled back , my lighter dropped to the ground . " Get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got a knife . " <p> He laughed and dropped his hand . " I 'm not gon na do nothing , little girl . Just wanted to tell you I liked your stuff . " <p> Out on the sidewalk I finished my beer . The next bus stopped , but I did n't move . It was too late to make the meeting now , anyway . And I wanted another drink . Shit , it was my birthday . I was forty years old . If I wanted a drink , I would have one . I walked north up to 32nd Street , turned east . One of my bars was there . <p> " Well , we ai n't seen you in a while , hon , " Denise said . " What 'll it be ? " <p> " A beer and a shot , " I replied . Sally Jessy was on the TV . It was around 11:30 . Denise put the beer and shot down in front of me and went back to Sally Jessy . I lit a cigarette and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for old man Charlie . A cool , dark hole . <p> Butt began to seek me out . I moved around a lot . It got to be a game . He 'd find me and sit with me . The others made no notice . We would talk , him about his crazy parents : they 'd had five kids , then got sick of it . Decided they 'd had enough . Decided they were n't Catholics anymore . Pulled their kids out of St. Anthony 's . Joined an encounter group . Now there was a naked headless mannequin in the living room . And they dealt dope . I told him how my brother and me were twins but born on different days , how Mom never married Dad , how he was already married . <p> Butt brought me things : cigarettes , beer , joints . He got me high the first time . The sweet taste alone was intoxicating , the heavy smell of the smoke , the way it hung in the air . He would brush against me when lighting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One time he brought me some earrings : two little hearts , each run through with an arrow . " I lifted them from the Kaufmann 's , " he 'd said . <p> " My ears are n't pierced , " I 'd said , sadly . I felt stupid . <p> " They are n't ? " he 'd asked , surprised . <p> " No . " <p> " Mmmm , " he sighed . " Hey , I think it 's cool , your ears are n't pierced . " He put his arm around my shoulder . He whispered in my ear , " Really cool . " He brought his fingers to my lobe and rubbed it slowly . " Yeah ... " Then he 'd turned my face to his and kissed me . <p> I jumped up . " I got ta go now , " I said and ran off . I went home and sat in my room , in the dark , playing it over and over in my head . I was excited . I was scared . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did n't push me . He let me get used to him . His nearness . He did n't try to kiss me again for a long time . He saw that I was jumpy . But he had a way of ending up on me . Before I noticed , he 'd have his leg on top of mine . Then I 'd move and he 'd never acknowledge it . His hand on my rib , his breath in my ear , his shoulder touching mine . He turned me on to speed  --  talk , talk , talk , talk . Then acid . He let me trust him . I trusted him . He began to talk about touching me . He told me that he wanted to touch me . He made me think that I wanted him to . When he said that I 'd like " making love " with him , that it would feel good , I believed him . <p> " You want another one , hon ? " <p> " What ? " I asked , confused . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Oh , yeah , yeah , and another shot . " Sally Jessy was over , now Geraldo was on . Old man Charlie waved at me from the other end of the bar . I waved back . I had to pee . I got up and went to the john . On my way back I stopped by the pay phone and called up Q. <p> " Hey , girl , where you been ? " she asked . " I been missing you . " <p> " I took a little vacation , " I said . " So , can you help me out ? " <p> " Shit yeah , I got some gooooood shit , girl , real good , " she said . " Uh-huh . " <p> " Okay , I 'll be up in an hour or so , " I said . <p> " An hour or so ? You ca n't get up here no sooner ? " <p> " Nope . " <p> " Shit , you getting drunk , ai n't you ? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know how you can do that shit , " Q returned . " It rots your gut . Later . " <p> " Later . " I hung up the phone and returned to my stool . <p> One night toward the end of that summer , while I was sitting against a tree , scraping my knife against a root , listening to the clear tinkle of the creek , Butt crept up and said , " I got us some good stuff tonight , girl . " <p> " What ? " I asked . <p> " Four-way windowpane , " he replied . <p> " What 's that ? " <p> " Only the best acid money can buy . My dad turned me onto it . " He squatted down in front of me . " Open your mouth . Lift your tongue . " He held the back of my head . I felt a tiny piece of something like sharp plastic . " Keep your tongue down , " Butt said . He 'd brought some beer , too . The night was clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It lit up the woods . We sat and drank the beer , waiting to get off , listening to the sound of the wind rustle the dying leaves . <p> The stars brightened in the sky . " Hey , look , " I said . " The stars are blinking off and on . " <p> " You 're starting to get off , " he said , his hand stroking my hair , burrowing down into my neck . He kissed me , slipped in his tongue , slowly washing my teeth . My whole body was tingling . I felt like I could n't breathe . His tongue was a gag . I broke the kiss , panting . " Wow , " I said . I rubbed my thumb back and forth over the blade of my knife , which I still held . The skin caught and bled . I brought it to my mouth . <p> " Gon na let me jump you tonight , Diane ? " <p> I could n't speak . Butt considered my silence acquiescence . He pushed me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was really getting off . The wind picked up , gusting over and around us . I was frozen , unable to move . Butt was over me kissing my neck and face . His mouth found mine again and he pushed his tongue in . I heard drums beating in my ears . He pulled back and unbuttoned my shirt , unzipped my shorts . I felt like I was watching us from above . I could n't act . Butt was suddenly hurried . He pulled my shorts and underpants down roughly . " Hey , " I tried to say . Fear started to prickle . Then he pulled his own pants down . I 'd never seen a penis before . Nothing to judge it against . But it seemed huge . It jutted out from his skinny body , shining . " No , " I tried to say . " No . " <p> " Spread your legs , " he panted . " Spread your legs ! Shit , I 'll do it , " he said when he got no response from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stab at my groin . <p> My brain and body remarried . My body thawed . This knowledge overwhelmed me : I could not have that thing in me . I understood that I did n't want it there . I never had . I tried to wriggle out from under him . I could n't get any words out . " Stop , " I would have said . I could hear the creek water rushing past . The moon shone down from above . It bathed my hand , my knife . I saw it shine ; then I used it . I brought it up under his ear . I had no hesitation . I sliced deeply . He groaned then collapsed on me . His warm wet blood rained down on me . <p> Dead weight is heavy . It was work to push him off . I was breathing shallowly , rapidly . I stumbled a few feet , knelt down against a tree . I wiped my blade clean . Then I vomited . Soon after I heard leaves rustling , things crashing through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growl , then another . Two dogs stood on either side of Butt , eyeing each other , sniffing at his pants . <p> I ran , tripping over sticks and rocks . I ran away . I heard them start to snarl and growl louder . I did n't go back . I was so high . I went to the schoolyard near my house and lay in one of the tubes all night . I felt between my legs , searching for damage . I was wet down there . I brought my finger up and put it to my lips . Blood there as well . <p> Someone touched my arm . I started . " How you doing , gal ? " old man Charlie said . " I ai n't seen you in a while . " <p> " Fine , fine , Charlie , " I said . I patted the barstool while I stood up . " Sit down , Charlie . Lemme buy you one . " <p> His pale old eyes lit up and his face cracked . " Thanks , dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and left . The heat again blanketed me at the door . I needed money . I walked back to Greenmount and hit the bank machine at the Nation 's Bank . The bus rolled up as I finished my business . I got on and went on up to Winston Avenue . I got out at the Popeye 's . Q liked chicken . She never ate . I bought her a few pieces . " Let 's party , " I said when she opened the door , handing her the chicken . <p> She hugged me to her thin body . " Yeah , girl . " Q 's hair was in a scarf ; her eyes darted quickly around the room . " You got some cash ? " <p> " Got four twenties , " I told her . <p> " Okay , I be right back . Do n't go nowhere , " she grinned . " I 'm so glad to see you . " <p> A hit of crack subdues the beast . For a moment he 's dead . You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of your eyes and process images . You 're full and content . There is no thought . You bear no responsibility . That 's the taste you never forget . <p> " Hi , my name is Diane and I 'm an addict . " <p> " Hey , Diane . " <p> When I say " I , " that 's fiction . There is no absolute , no history . Other players might argue the account if they could , or cared to . Some may be in the grave , others in the bar ; others still would be better off in either place . They are slumped on their couches , arms and legs , torsos rotting , waiting , simply waiting . For what ? Rubbing sleep from their eyes , facing the days , the months , the years , with less and less . I grow more facile with time . That makes me an optimist , and a teller of tales . <p> <p> By Bethalee Jones <p>              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
