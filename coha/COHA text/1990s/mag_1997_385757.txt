If the prevalence of bone-density scan machines-not just in doctors ' offices and hospitals but in retail stores and malls-is any indication , a woman 's bone density is of paramount importance . At first glance , this seems reasonable : after menopause women experience a dramatic decrease in estrogen , a hormone that , among its other important duties , enables our bones to retain calcium . Osteoporosis , the gradual loss of bone density , is common in postmenopausal women . Congruently , the most frightening health problem associated with osteoporosis , hip fracture , occurs often among elderly women . A broken hip means at least a temporary end to independence and , according to one widely quoted statistic from the National Institutes of Health , a 12 to 20 percent decrease in life expectancy . One is led to believe that bone-density scans form an important part of the effort to prevent osteoporosis and hip fracture . However , these tests are far from reliable predictors of who will suffer fractures later in life , according to a recent analysis of 11 studies conducted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reported in the May 1996 British Medical Journal . Why ? " Bone mineral density scans can identify people who are at increased risk of developing a fracture , but they can not with any certainty identify individuals who will develop a future fracture , " writes Deborah Marshall , principal researcher of the study . David Atkins , M.D. , who served as the science adviser for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force 1996 report on screening tests , concurs with Marshall . " Bone density is only one of many things that influence the risk of fracture , " Atkins says . " Taken together , many other factors are equally strong predictors of hip fracture , such as advanced age , poor muscle strength , medications such as tranquilizers , barbiturates , thyroid therapy , and impaired vision poor depth perception . For most women , the decision to take estrogen should not hinge solely on bone density . " The push for bone-density scans for medium- and low-risk women is , in many ways , a push to get healthy women on drugs without proof that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the task force report gives pharmaceutical guidelines not necessarily told to women by their doctors : " Randomized trials have demonstrated that calcium supplementation and estrogen are effective in preserving bone density and preventing fracture in postmenopausal highrisk women . Few prospective studies have been able to demonstrate directly that these kinds of interventions reduce fractures in mediumto low-risk women . " Basically , the promotion of osteoporosis as a disease-and a woman 's disease at that , despite the fact that one of every eight men over age SO is affectedis just another example of normal bodily processes being pathologized . In some ways osteoporosis is like menopause , a function of aging . Besides , " the definition of osteoporosis is arbitrary , " says Dr. Atkins , describing the standard definition as 2 to 2.5 deviations ( roughly 20 to 2S percent ) below the normal bone mass of a 30year-old . Using that criterion , " most postmenopausal women could be defined as having a disease that in turn opens the door to widespread use of treatments that should be targeted more selectively , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing against treating osteoporosis , but the universal screening of women may encourage overprescription of estrogen and new osteoporosis drugs like Fosamax , which are being marketed aggressively to both doctors and female consumers . Since the ultimate aim is to prevent hip fracture , not simply to preserve bone density , " routine preventive measures like exercise and getting enough calcium are important for all women regardless of bone density , " says Dr. Atkins . Hip fracture , as opposed to wrist or spinal ( compression ) fractures , has always been the primary focus of osteoporosis prevention because it causes the most serious problems in old age . But according to Dr. Atkins , hip fracture is often a marker but not the cause of impending death ; most women who suffer a hip fracture have severe concomitant illness that accounts for much of the increased risk of mortality . Despite doubts raised by these and other researchers , gynecologists appear sold on estrogen as the best way to prevent hip fracture-even for relatively low-risk women . And many large hospitals have osteoporosis screening clinics that offer bone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at the published studies that raise questions about bone density as the predictor of osteoporosis or the value of bone scans , you will see that they do n't appear in the OB/GYN journals , " observes New York City-based gynecological physician 's assistant Virginia Reath . " Most gynecologists I know get their information from journals and professional conferences , the latter often funded by drug companies . " The prevailing message is that hip fracture is a major public health problem and that hormone and drug therapies are the best forms of prevention . The fear-inducing publicity given to osteoporosis in women 's magazines and calcium ads has created a demand for bone-density scans , when it is only necessary or appropriate to screen women with multiple risk factors . Moreover , Dr. Atkins warns that bonescan results-whether good or bad-may send the wrong message to women . In one survey he cited , women who had been told they had low bone density were more likely to restrict their activities than were women with normal bone density . Many women who 'd been told their bone density @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond the scan was needed in order to prevent fracture in old age . They remained unaware of the danger of smoking , which leeches calcium from bones , and how crucial it is to keep bones and muscle mass in good shape through exercise and proper nutrition ( including limiting alcohol consumption ) . Though most osteoporosis screening clinics do stress the importance of exercise , diet , smoking cessation , and so forth , the emphasis is clearly on bone-density measurement . The reason seems to lie with the interests of business rather than those of the patient . At Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City , for example , routine bone scans of the hip , wrist , and spine cost $300 altogether . Women are encouraged to come back for retesting every one to three years ( depending upon risk factors ) . After all , marketing experts noticed a long time ago that screening tests for women are a drawing card that ultimately brings the whole family in as hospital customers . And as for the emergence of bone fracture as a social health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times as many women-four million-are physically abused by their partners each year , often resulting in fractures . But , there are no drug sales in domestic violence , and thus no scanning machines have yet been devised to detect it . Author Affiliation <p>                     @x Sic Transit Tokyo <br> <br> Sei pressed her cheek against the cold glass ; strips of black mountains tore by under lantern-blue clouds beyond her wide window . She knew a man was watching her  --  the way men on trains always watched her . The train car rocked gently from side to side , hushing its charges like a worried mother . She chewed on the ends of her dark blue hair . A stupid childhood habit , but Sei could n't let it go . She let the wet curl fall back against her bare shoulder blades . She stroked the glass with her fingertips , shifted her hips against the white of the carriage  --  she was always moved to do this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stays . They were so pale and pure and unfathomably fast , like iridescent snakes hissing down to the sea . The Shinkansen was always pristine , always perfect , its aim always true . <br> Sei 's skin prickled as the man 's eyes slid over her back . She felt their cold black weight , shifting her shoulders to bear up under it . He would be watching the small of her back now , where her silver-black shirt fell away into a mess of carefully arranged silk ropes and tin chains . He would watch her angles under the strings , the crease of her legs beneath an immodest skirt , her lips moving against the glass . The little wet fog of her breath . She could almost tell what he looked like without turning her head : good black suit , a little too small , clutching his briefcase like a talisman , probably a little gray at the temples , no rings on his hands . They all looked like that . <br> Sei turned , her blue hair brushing her hipbones . Good black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freckles of gray in the hair . No rings . He did not seem startled or doubled over with desire as they sometimes were . He was calm , his answering smile measured and almost sweet , like a photograph of a soldier lost in a long-ago war . Coolly , without taking his dark eyes from hers , he turned over his left palm and rested it on the creamy brown edge of his briefcase . <br> His hand was covered in a mark she first thought horrible  --  it snaked and snarled , black and swollen , where fortune-teller 's lines ought to have been . Like a spider it sent long web-spokes out from a circle in the center , shooting towards the pads of his fingers and burrowing into the tiny webbing of skin between them . She took a step forward , balancing expertly as the car sped on , and stared . It was something like a little map , drawn there by an inartful and savage hand . She could make out minuscule lettering along the inky corridors : street names she could hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near his thumb . As she leaned in , the man shut his fist . <br> " Sato Kenji , " he said , his voice neither high nor low , but cultured , clipped , quiet . <br> " Amaya Sei . " <br> He quirked an eyebrow briefly , slightly , in such a way that no one afterwards might be able to safely accuse him of having done it . Sei knew the look . Names are meaningless , plosives and breath , but those who liked the slope of her waist often made much of hers , which denoted purity , clarity  --  as though it had any more in the way of depth than others . They wondered , all of them , if she really was pure , as pure as her name announced her to be , all white banners and hymeneal grace . <br> She balanced one hand  --  many-ringed  --  on her hip and jerked her head in the manner of a fox snuffling the air for roasting things . " What 's wrong with your hand ? " <br> " Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She quirked her own eyebrow , also blue , and delicately pierced with a frosted ring . He gestured for her to sit down and , though she knew better , they sat together for a moment , her body held tense and tight , ready to run , to cry out if need be . Their thighs touched  --  a gesture of intimacy she had never allowed herself with another passenger . <br> " I think you like trains rather too much , Sei . " The older man smelled of sandalwood and the peculiar thin scent of clean train cars . <br> " I 'm not sure how that 's any of your business . " <br> " It is n't , of course . I like them , too . I own a car , I have no need to ride the Shinkansen back and forth from Tokyo to Kyoto like some kind of Bedouin . It 's an expensive habit . But love is love , and love is compulsion . I must , and I do . " <br> He gently tapped the brass clasp on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in black , its title embossed in silver : <br> A History of Train Travel on the Japanese Isles , <br> by Sato Kenji <br> Sei ran her hand over the cover as she had done the window glass . Her skin felt hot , too small for her bones . He opened the book  --  the pages were thick and expensive , so that the stamp of the press had almost made little valleys of the kanji , the cream-colored paper rising slightly above the ink . Kenji took her hand in his . His fingernails were very clean . He read to her with the low , vibratory tones of shared obsession . <br> A folktale current in Hokkaido just after the war and passed from conductor to conductor held that the floor of heaven is laced with silver train tracks , and the third rail is solid pearl . The trains that ran along them were fabulous even by the standards of the Shinkansen of today : carriages containing whole pine forests hung with golden lanterns , carriages full of rice terraces , carriages lined in red silk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a neat lump of opium with persimmon tea poured over it in the most delicate of cups . These trains sped past each other , utterly silent , carrying each a complement of ghosts who clutched the branches like leather handholds , and plucked the green rice to eat raw , and fell back insensate into the laps of women whose faces were painted red from brow to chin . They never stop , never slow , and only with great courage and grace could a spirit slowly progress from car to car , all the way to the conductor 's cabin , where all accounts cease , and no man knows what lies therein . <br> In Hokkaido , where the snow and ice are so white and pure that they glow blue , it is said that only the highest engineers of Japan Railways know the layout of the railroads on the floor of heaven . They say that those exalted engineers are working , slowly , generation by generation , to lay the tracks on earth so that they mirror exactly the tracks in heaven . When this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky , and we may know on earth , without paying the terrible fare of death , the gaze of the red women , the light of the forest lanterns , and the taste of persimmon tea . <br> Sato Kenji looked up from his book and into Sei 's eyes . She knew her face was flushed and red  --  she did not care . Her hands shook , her legs ached . She could not harness her breath . She did not need these trains for simple transport either , but longed for them , the cold rush of their passing as she stood on the wind-whipped platform , the slink of doors sliding closed behind her as the train accepted her as its own . That ache had begun long before Kenji had come on board . She felt their hands touching , their train-haunted hands . She took his book from his easy grip and held it to her , her heart beating against it , as if to read it through bone and flesh and leather , directly , needfully , ventricle pressed to page . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not return it , and he would not ask for it back . <br> Instead  --  and later she would wonder why she did it , why such a thing would have occurred to her , and will never be able to say  --  she took Sato Kenji by their linked hands and led him to the rickety , shivering place between the carriage cars , where the wind keened and crooned through the cracks in the grating and the white walls gave way to chrome . She kissed the gray of his hair . The space between them was thick , crackling , and though she told herself that it was unwise , a reckless thing , she moved through that wild , manic air and into him , his mouth , his skin . <br> He buried his face in her neck and , as though she weighed nothing , hefted her up against the carriage door , her blue hair flattening against the glass . Sei let out a small cry , like the whistle of an engine , and ground against him , shifting to let him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collarbone . His palm was pressed against her back , the black mark hot there , a sear , a brand . Sei clutched his book against his back and shut her eyes , feeling the train jerk and jolt against her . She felt enormous , cracked open , as though she had taken all of the great train into herself , as though the shuddering , scholarly thrusts of Sato Kenji were the loving gestures of her beloved Shinkansen , only guided by the man with the briefcase , guided up and out of him , guided into her , guided across the silver tracks of heaven . <br> <br> Chapter Two <br> Cities of the Bees <br> <br> There is a place on the interstate where the last black fingernails of Los Angeles fall away and the whole of the San Joaquin valley spreads out below the mountains , impossibly golden , checkered in green and wheat and strawberry fields and orange groves and infinitely long rows of radishes , where the land is shriven of all the sins of palm-bound , artifice-mad Southern California . <br> November @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bare foot on the gas pedal throbbed as it approached , as her little green car , heavy with produce , crested the last rise in the tangled highways of the Grapevine , and the light began to change , gratefully , from raw , livid brume to a gold like the blood of saints . Her throat caught as the great , soft fields unfolded below her , yawning , stretching all the way to San Francisco and further still , to the redwoods and Oregon , all the way up . <br> She had often imagined , as a girl , when her mother drove back and forth between the two great cities of the west , that I-5 went on simply forever , past Canada to the North Pole , where the center divider would be wrapped up in ice and the bridges cut out of arctic stone . Even now , charting the coast in her own right , she sometimes thought of ignoring the off-ramps and speeding up and up , to the cold stars and fox-haunted glaciers . But in the end , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the rest of the world was lost behind a curtain of fog and gnarled red trees . <br> She could never escape the feeling of strange Spanish holiness that California bestowed  --  the cities named for saints , angels , benediction . The capital itself a sacrament . Like communion wafers she tasted the places on her tongue , the red roof tiles blood-vivid . Her own blood bisected the state , her mother , retired , warming her bones against the southern sea , her father , dead ten years , buried in the wet northern moss . <br> They met in the south , on a dock far out in the frothing turquoise Pacific , her young mother in rolled-up olive overalls with a great long knife in her hands , slaughtering a small blue shark she had caught by accident , trying for salmon . She was bloody to her elbows , her clothes a ruin , arterial spray across her cheek . Her father tied his little sailboat to the pier and she looked up at him over a carcass of silver and scarlet . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ November 's father was gone , up north , away from his wife and the sea . They could not bear each other , in the end , and perhaps a thing begun in blood and death and salt must end that way . They could not live with less than three mountain ranges to separate them . And between them they strung their daughter , and like a shining black bead counting out refutations of love , she slowly slid back and forth , back and forth . Finally , she had settled on her father 's country , and left the loud blues and golds of the south , unable to bear them herself . <br> She did not live in San Francisco , of course . She could not afford it . But she was drawn to it , rising up from the bay like the star of the sea , resting in a shell , all blue veils and promises of absolution . And at night it was a mass of light at the end of all those bridges , all those highways , looking east with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grave in Benicia , holding tenuously to the town 's boldly proclaimed blessings , and with the grave she tended sixteen hexagonal beehives . She had named all the queens . She kept for them pristine and intricate gardens to flavor their feet , and the honey in turn , and it was this golden science that occupied the small and guarded territory of her interior , even as she traveled the long , slow road out of the desert , her trunk full of sleeping yucca bulbs and infant jacarandas , their roots bound up in earth and linen . Even as she found herself turning from the last scrap of highway and into the interminable column of cars creeping across the great iron mass of the Bay Bridge . <br> How we are willing to wait , she thought , like a line of penitent adulterers at a white altar , to be allowed into the city . How we gather at this dull gray gate , knowing that the golden one is a lie . It is only there for show . The faithful know that God lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cathedral , while the wise gather here , in the low and long , waiting patiently to hand over their coins and be permitted , for a moment , to look upon , but not touch , the mass of jewels and offerings in which San Francisco wallows . <br> November drove slowly in , and the water below her was black . She sought out Chinatown reflexively , found a shop cashiered by a spectacled biology student which sold star anise and scallions . She loved Chinatown at three in the morning  --  the reds and greens were muted , shadowed into black by the gaps between streetlamps . It was secret , lonely ; every pink neon character seemed brave against the dark . <br> It took skill , a mapmaker 's skill , to find an open restaurant that would not turn a lone woman away , sure that her cup of coffee and wonton soup are hardly worth the effort of clearing a table . But on that night of all nights , November needed only a half an hour 's cartomancy before she found one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soup dumplings , braised pork , and peppered oysters . <br> The booth was hard , cracked vinyl the color of a Chevrolet interior left in the sun for twenty years . A television mounted in the ceiling corner flashed the news from Beijing without subtitles . Thus , her attention wandered and fell on a young woman in the next booth over sipping soup , her bright blue eyes belying Chinese features . The two women watched each other for a space , the only customers in an empty cafe , until finally , the other woman placed one delicate finger against her iris and deftly slid the contact lens aside like a curtain , quirking a smile as the wrinkled lens showed black beneath . <br> When November tries to remember this night a year from now , she will think the woman 's name was Xiaohui . She will be almost sure she can remember the ring of the name , falling into her ear like a little copper bell . She will remember that they shared dumplings , and that the woman was a Berkeley student , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mohammed 's grandchildren , and could recite the drifting census data of the ancient city of Karakorum , where the Khans raised tents of scarlet . <br> November had only her bees . They suddenly seemed paltry to her , poor and needy . <br> Continues ...
