<p> ROAD work ahead ! <p> If President Clinton has his way with Congress , motorists will soon be seeing this sign more often . As part of Mr. Clinton 's $ 31 billion economic stimulus package , the president wants projects that can be enacted quickly . For the most part , that means more road graders and pavers at work . <p> So far states have identified $ 6.87 billion in projects that can be put to contract in the next 30 to 90 days if Congress supplies the money , according to a survey by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials . <p> If the projects are shared on the same 80 percent federal , 20 percent state basis normally used , Congress would have to provide an additional $ 5.5 billion in transportation funding over the $ 21.8 billion appropriated for next year as part of a 1991 highway bill . <p> The group of state highway and transportation officials reports that only two states , Ohio and Hawaii , indicated they would have difficulty spending additional federal funding in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all 50 states failed to spend about $ 500 million out of the $ 18 billion appropriated . <p> But that does n't necessarily mean that a lot of new jobs will be created by the increased federal spending . State officials say that the number of jobs created by such projects will be insignificant compared to unemployment numbers . <p> The National Governors ' Association , whose members made a case last week before a House subcommittee for more infrastructure spending , estimates that a billion dollars of federal spending will create up to 60,000 jobs , directly and indirectly . <p> However , Gov . Jim Edgar ( R ) of Illinois told the subcommittee that 126,000 jobs would be created if the 1991 highway bill , formally called the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act or " Ice Tea , " received an extra $ 3.8 billion in funding next year . <p> If Congress appropriates the full Clinton stimulus package of $ 31 billion - which includes job-retraining funds and tax incentives for small businesses - more jobs would be created . But no one knows if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clinton this year . <p> Some economists are skeptical . " We are trying to find historical precedent for that many jobs from such a relatively small stimulus , " says James Padinha , chief economist of First Interstate BanCorp . " Thirty billion spread over a $ 6 trillion economy is rather small . " <p> But even limited federal spending can benefit economically hard-pressed parts of the United States , labor experts say . " You know , almost anything would be bound to help , " says Herbert Bienstock , an economist and labor expert with Queens College , of the City University of New York . <p> A look at how the Clinton stimulus program will affect a few key states across the country : California <p> Though California 's jobless rate dropped this week from 9.8 percent to 9.5 percent , it still hovers well above the national rate of 7.1 percent . <p> Jack Kyser , chief economist for the Los Angeles Economic Development Corporation , says Clinton 's economic stimulus package may put a significant dent in the unemployment figure . <p> " Any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect , " Mr. Kyser says , " from cement , to steel , to manufacturing to high-tech . " <p> But other economists remain wary . " In a general sense , it 's easy to say any stimulus is good , " says Steve Levy , director of the Center for the Continuing Study of the California Economy . " But people here are waiting for the details . " <p> To ready themselves for the expected infusion of federal funds , dozens of municipal agencies are already preparing inventories of bridges , roads , sewers , and other public projects badly in need of repair , or that need to be brought into compliance with state or federal laws . <p> " We have asked every city and county in the state to give us a list of projects that could be under contract within 90 days , " says James Drago , a spokesman for the California Department of Transportation . <p> Economists in California say that , even more than the infrastructure spending , the state will welcome Clinton 's proposed tax breaks for start-up businesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But some experts warn that jobs created by tax incentives could be offset by those lost through further cutbacks in the defense budget . The defense and aerospace industries centered in southern California could be forced into further consolidation and downsizing . The industries have already lost about 500,000 jobs since 1989 . <p> The part of the Clinton program that elicits the most skepticism in California is the president 's job-retraining proposal . Thousands of unemployed defense and aerospace workers in the Golden State have already been retrained in such fields as hazardous-waste cleanup , only to find no work available in their new field . <p> " Given their past experience , and age , and salary expectation where do you put them ? " asks Joe Wahed , economic analyst for Wells Fargo Bank . Texas <p> Texas had 690,000 people out of work in December ; the unemployment rate was 7.7 percent . But the $ 130 million in road repair projects that could be begun within 120 days would directly employ just 3,120 people and cost $ 24 million , says Robert Wilson , assistant director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Mr. Wilson adds that " you always like to get money to do available jobs any time you can . We got plenty of needs , there 's no doubt about that . " <p> He says the state would spend any new money from the Clinton administration to repair existing highways . But he adds that highways are in better shape in Texas than in other parts of the country . North Carolina <p> Gov . James Hunt ( D ) of North Carolina has sent Clinton a list of $ 42.9 million in airport improvements , $ 48.5 million in transit spending , and $ 368.7 million for 212 highway construction projects . <p> The most important highway projects involve expanding some of the Interstate roads . For example , the state would like to widen Interstate 85 between Gastonia and Charlotte , the state 's largest city . I-85 would grow to a total of six lanes . As of 1991 , some 60,000 vehicles per day used that stretch of road . <p> Another proposed project is the completion of a loop around the central business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per day use the road which has been under construction since 1985 . <p> It takes so long to build , says Bill Jones of the state highway department , that the highway is built in sections as funding becomes available . " It can take seven to nine years to build a major highway , " he explains . South Carolina <p> Neighboring South Carolina has a much less ambitious program . <p> According to South Carolina 's response to a survey by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials , the state would spend $ 15-25 million to accelerate its bridge-replacement program and repaving programs . <p> The state also says it could spend another $ 25 million on projects which are currently delayed by the regulatory process . Georgia <p> Georgia has compiled a list of $ 4.2 million in projects that can be started by March and $ 45 million that can be ready to go by the summer . <p> Among the Peach State projects is a widening of Interstate 95 south of United States freeway 17 to the Ogeechee River at a cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I-95 to become congested , which affect air quality and other forms of pollution , " says Jerry Stargel , a spokesman for the Georgia Department of Transportation . <p> The other major expenditure is the replacement of the Jekyll Island bridge at a cost of $ 8 million . " That 's past due to be replaced , " Mr. Stargel says . " It 's usually just hanging up all the time . " Florida <p> Ben Watts , Florida 's secretary of transportation , estimates the state could spend about $ 335 million on new transit , road , bridge , and port projects . However he says he will not compile a specific list " until I know how much money is available , what the criteria are , and what the time frame is . " <p> Mr. Watts says he does not want to disappoint communities with promises he can not keep . <p> Despite his concern , he says the state could go to contract on an expansion of Interstate 75 from four to six lanes . <p> " The most strain is from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line , " Watts says . <p> Watts says Florida would love to use some new federal money for mass-transit projects such as new rail commuter lines . However , these projects can not be ready in 90 days . " What we would like is some flexibility , " he concludes . Illinois <p> Michael Lawrence , Governor Edgar 's spokesman , says that under a fully funded federal highway bill , Illinois would get an additional 4,600 jobs . That would put one person to work in the state for every hundred who are unemployed there . <p> " I do n't think the governor advertised this as ... the cure-all for unemployment , " Mr. Lawrence says . " Obviously , that 's a small percent of people out of work , but for those 126,000 who would be in those jobs , it would be very important . If you 're unemployed in this country , you 're unemployment rate is 100 percent , no matter what the nation 's unemployment rate is . " <p> " If President Clinton is looking for ways to stimulate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . New York <p> New York is readying for President Clinton a list of highway , housing , sewer , and parking-lot projects expected to total from $ 500 million to $ 1 billion , says David Egner , spokesman for Gov . Mario Cuomo ( D ) . <p> The Empire State had 721,000 people unemployed in December , an 8.5 percent rate . <p> The latest national unemployment statistics show a jump in unemployment for New York City , from 11 percent in December to 13.4 percent in January . <p> Unemployment traditionally jumps somewhat in January , as companies lay off part-time workers , notes Samuel Ehrenhalt , regional commissioner for the US Bureau of Labor Statistics . But the latest round of numbers is " troubling " because they are much higher than had been anticipated , he says . <p> Rosemary Scanlon , chief economist for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey , says that many of the jobs lost in those states involve high- paying professional positions . Whether those professional , middle-class-oriented jobs will ever come back to this region , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most New York experts stress that while a jobs program would be helpful in creating short-term jobs , it would not restore positions lost in such upscale industries as finance and banking . <p> Moreover , the actual dollar impact of such a program is expected to be modest .
