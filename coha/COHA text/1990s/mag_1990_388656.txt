Section : ON THE SCENE <p> Dateline : GUATEMALA CITY <p> ON A CLEAR evening outside the Hotel . El Dorado , hundreds of people , mostly young , dance and sing to the Latin beats blasting from a dozen mega-speakers clustered around the market square . A girl in a UCLA sweatshirt sits atop her boyfriend 's shoulders for a better view . Suddenly , she points to a small commotion in the back and shouts , " There he is ! " This is election night here , and the " he " is Alvaro Arzu , presidential candidate for the National Advancement Party . Arzu squeezes his way up to the microphone to thunderous cheers . <p> And these are the losers . In something of an upset , Arzu came in a distant third behind Jorge Carpio of the National Center Union and Jorge Serrano of the Solidarity Action Movement , and is thus excluded from the run-off election between the top two contenders . When one of these two men is sworn in on January 13 , it will mark the first transfer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in more than 35 years . Not bad for a nation that probably would have gone under had America not elected Ronald Reagan in 1980 . <p> Guatemala was the original Banana Republic , and indeed one or two of the 12 presidential candidates have almost as much gold braid on their caps as the Hilton doorman . But time has taken off some of the rougher edges , and although there are still enough disappearances and kidnappings to keep Amnesty International in high dudgeon , the majority now appear to be driven by good , old-fashioned motives like greed and revenge rather than politics or ideology . At one briefing we learn that , in Guatemala 's relatively open economy , taxes account for only 8 per cent of gross domestic product ( compared to about 28 per cent for the U.S. ) . The news is greeted by my friend Jacob Weisberg of The New Republic and like-minded companions with knowing frowns , as though they 'd heard that Guatemala had yet to stamp out smallpox . <p> We are all here as part of a team of international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guatemalan businessmen who themselves represent the nation 's transition from a land once dominated by sugar and coffee plantations into one where new industries and new markets  --  everything from shrimps and garlic to snow peas and chemical products  --  stand to overtake the traditional economy in a year or so . I confess I was at first reluctant to come . The idea of monitoring elections in Central America conjured up grim images of Jimmy Carter and Father Hesburgh and interminable homilies on land reform . <p> In fact it turned out to be scads of fun , a Club Med for Beltway types . " Work " was one continuous party , an unending series of interviews and receptions , including a briefing at the U.S. Embassy , where human-affairs officer Lewis Amselem told us how pro-American the Guatemalan people are ( judging from the grilling that followed , this is something that distinguishes Guatemalans from the majority of the international-observer team ) . The evening before , even the wife of the leading leftist candidate , Carmen Escribando de Leon , told us that the army today is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of those at the briefing want to hear only about army abuses . As in the Amnesty reports , where death squads are right-wing by definition , the estimated 1,100 to 1,500 Communist guerrillas get scant attention from us gringos . <p> On Sunday , the day of the elections , my group left the hotel at 7 A.M. for Chimaltenango , an Indian area in the highlands an hour 's drive outside the capital . In addition to two other American monitors in our car  --  one a staffer for Senator Dave Durenberger ( R. , Minn. ) and the other the head of College Republicans  --  we had four delightful assistants from Youth for Guatemala . As we barreled down the Pan American Highway , rap music blared from the radio . " If you keep importing this stuff , " I told them , " you 're going to stay a Third World nation . " <p> At the first polling site we visited , large numbers of men in panama hats and flannel shirts were lined up to vote ; there were almost no women . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian families the men would not let their wives vote . There , as everywhere else we went , the mood was casual and easy-going . Some of the party representatives we talked with accused the competition of buying votes , but none of our group saw any evidence of this . Later on , at a little village called Balanya , representatives of the three top parties complained that they had been locked out of the initial counting of the blank ballots at 6 A.M. , and a Mr. Mario Batzin claimed that a Mr. Freddy Alberto Salazar Barrios had told him to keep his mouth shut or he 'd toss him in the poky for a spell . I listened attentively , took copious notes , and discharged my solemn obligations to the democratic process by finking on them all when we got back to Guatemala City . <p> But the interesting questions of this election had nothing to do with intimidation or vote-buying . They had to do with the exclusion of General Jose Efrain Rios Montt , an Evangelical Protestant who reigned over this land after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday sermons on TV . During his 16-month rule the general moved decisively against the guerrillas ( he once said his was not a " scorched-earth " but a " scorched-Communist policy " ) , under a slogan loosely translated as " beans and bullets . " The gist of this was arming the people and guaranteeing their food supplies , something they have n't forgotten . A Catholic priest here named Father Hugo confirmed to me that Rios Montt would get all the votes in his mainly Indian parish , though he himself could n't stand the man . I asked one voter why Rios Montt is so popular . " He gave us our dignity , " said the man , a poor ladino  --  mixed Indian and Spanish blood  --  who drives a vegetable truck . <p> Nonetheless , the Supreme Court disqualified the general 's petition to stand for office . At breakfast the day after the results came in , he was pretty vague about everything except taxes ( he would cut them ) , and implied that the solution to all Guatemala 's woes was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office . In my mind the Supreme Court did the right thing by excluding him . But it did strike me that many of the people on our trip who found General Rios Montt so appalling thought Daniel Ortega a splendid candidate in Nicaragua . <p> Indeed , the only real clashes we saw in Guatemala occurred among the observers themselves . A number of the pests wanted to detail every minor report of irregularities in our statement , which then naturally would be highlighted by the press , so that by the time it came out in the New York Times the headline would have been : " Guatemalans Go to the Polls ; Elections Marred by Fraud , Vote-Buying . " But Representative Bob Livingston ( R. , La. ) , unofficial chairman of our group and veteran of elections in Panama , El Salvador , and the Philippines , put the big kibosh on those efforts during the meeting of observers , and at the press conference that followed he noted that the just-ended elections were as fair as any in his home state of Louisiana . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old faith dies hard , and there are those determined not to let it go . While awaiting our flight home , one member of our group who had scowled through most of the trip was asked what he thought about what he 'd seen . " Well , procedurally they were fair , " he said , " but I have to get back to Washington to see what I think .
