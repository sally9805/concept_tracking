1 <p> It was almost a decade since I found myself for the price of a ten-cent admission fee in a little motion-picture theater on Broadway . As I assumed a seat , a player piano was attacking a Johann Strauss waltz , " Voices from the Vienna Woods . " Upon the floor , a squalid puddle of peanut shells . <p> Around me , men , women and children divided the sustained comfort of chewing gum with the fleeting rapture of the nut . <p> One decade ago . This was the representative accommodation of the motion picture . <p> And the film ! A two-reel Drama of the West . As I regarded its palsied agitation , there rose in my mind images of the beauteous Carmen entrancing that febrile twig of infantry , Don Jose ; the bold Gascon D'Artagnan taking honorable place with the dashing threesome , Aramis , Porthos and Athos ; young Henry Esmond crossing the channel with the Young Pretender . <p> Why not ? Why should not every Great Novel , Drama and Opera of the world be transmitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I left the theater , I was no longer the cotton-goods salesman from Schenectady , New York . I was-thanks to the grace of the Almighty and that imperfect implement , the Human Brain-what I became , Harry Fishman of Megalo-Fishman Productions . <p> - from The Autobiography of Harry Fishman ( 1922 ) <p> " Garbo , " said Mama , " Was a thick-legged Svenska salesgirl on whom the gods had accidentally dripped angel dust . Stiller and Pabst discovered the thickness melted away in closeups . She could n't move without tripping over her feet-they were huge-so they kept her still . They invented Garbo . Mayer saw the invention and brought it to MGM . A tough guy who thought he was tough , and she squeezed him like an old orange . He paid her a fortune . She never spent a nickel . On her Grand Rapids tables , she draped horrible plastic . She ate out of cans . She was her own dog . And they called this human cash register divine . <p> " In 1930 or ' 31 , Schulberg brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deflated soccer balls .

Though I 've heard from men and women who had the not-exactly-rare privilege of her none-too-clean sheets that she had no interest whatsoever in that . ( Nor do I. All this putting in and taking out , such a fuss about it . ) La Lena thought she 'd invented fellatio , thought her lips were a divine endowment . <p> " The only thing in the world she cared about was how she looked on and off camera .

( I think she made her living in the street-despite her highfalutin Prussian airs . ) <p> " Anyway , Laemmele wanted a share of this vamp pie , which is how I came to this cloud-cuckoo-land . I 'd done Mist and was filming Raven Lover in Budapest when I got the offer . ( Summons is more like it , subpoena . ) I did n't want to leave Europe , but it was the Depression , Papa had lost his job , there was no money for films , and you , cherie , were in my belly . So we boarded the Bremen with everything we owned . A month later , we were staring at orange trees from a phony palace with six chimneys , a swimming pool and more plumbing than in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she did n't need a Sternberg to tell her how to kiss and piss . I talked to cameramen , electricians , assistant directors , I 'd already read Film als Kunst , I 'd been in the theater , I 'd done four films , I knew the difference between film action and stage . I could move slowly , legs , arms , eyebrows . I knew where the arc light should go to catch the tips of my hair . I could sniff a burnt-out bulb thirty yards away . There was no problem with voice , even my accent . You know my ear is perfect . I picked up American like a shot . I was musical-nine years of pianoforte-I could move-five years of ballet . Above all , I did n't care if it stopped . When Thalberg borrowed me for The Czarina , I knew what I was worth , and if they did n't , too bad . I had you , and , for a while , Papa . What else did I need ? <p> Rien du tout . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were eight , you knew more about makeup and costume , shadows and silence than most directors .

When his car has a dent , you know it . You know what he reads , sees , eats . You do n't have an address , a phone number , a fax number in your Rolodex : you have a human being . <p> Sometimes clients need roses , sometimes gold , sometimes a kiss .
