In late November , as Audrey Michell stripped a golden leaf from <p> croissant , a young couple passed and repassed Boudin 's window , then came and sat beside her as if in all Chicago they sought only her . They stared . Audrey stared back . The young man ducked his head in apology . The woman touched his sleeve . She was wearing a diamond as big as the Prudential Building and a wide gold band . <p> He said , " I ca n't . " <p> " I will then . " <p> " When we 're sure , " he said . <p> That fall Audrey had been Lunching on Michigan Boulevard , around the corner from her office , arranging , as was her wont , to arrive early and avoid the inconvenience of standing in line for her salad and sourdough bread . If she timed her lunch precisely she could sit alone , facing the window , watch the people go by and ask herself , " What now ? " <p> Sometimes she asked , " What now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Richard still wanted to love her , but not exclusively . His card at Halloween said , " Money minimal . Still no tenure . Not in academe . Not in romance , " and she knew she had made the right decision four years ago . Richard gave her headaches . Academia gave her headaches . " No wonder , " her colleagues used to say . " You work too hard . " <p> The young couple came back the next day . <p> And the next . <p> They were a proper pair , overdressed as was Audrey for standing in line for a sourdough sandwich . Both wore Guccis . He had the amiable , Victorian look of a ringed seal . He would probably wear black slacks and loafers in the Amazon jungle . She had high sharp cheekbones , thin lips , a thin nose and a debutante crouch . <p> On the third day they found Audrey far back in the restaurant . As the woman put down her tray , she said , " We want you to have our baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why ? " <p> " Because , " the young husband said , " we ca n't . " <p> " We 've looked and looked for the right person , " the young woman said . <p> He blushed and tore his pink napkin into thin strips . " And you look remarkably like my wife . " <p> The woman 's hand on Audrey 's arm was firm . " Look , please . " She held out the mirror from her purse . <p> What Audrey saw shocked her . She had the same lips and nose as the stranger . The same faint lines at the corners of her mouth . But her own lips were shiny purple-pink . Her own hair was long , frizzy and black . Her own eyes were shadowed with pink and purple . " I 'm all she could be if she tried , " Audrey thought , and stiffened her spine to sit straighter . Spiked heels . A purple pant suit as well-bred as the other woman 's wheat-colored tweeds , but not so polite . The mirror trembling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waif whose every movement was an apology could have been her younger sister . <p> " Please , " the young couple said as if in one voice , a habit Audrey would come to find endearing . The man tore his napkin strips in half . <p> The wife said , " You 're the only one we 've found who would be right . " <p> " You do n't have to do anything with me . " The young man blushed again . " Could you trust us enough to come to our house and talk about it ? When we got engaged , I promised Jenny I 'd buy her a baby . " <p> Their card said : LLOYD AND JENNY COMRICK . <p> They lived on Cleveland , three blocks south of Fullerton . <p> Their house had been gutted . A stairway coiled up past bedrooms , baths , leafy corners for music-listening or solitary desk-and-computer work , to a stained glass dome . Downstairs , the entire north wall was a lighted aquarium for Lloyd 's tropical fish . The furniture seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have served the same old-fashioned dinner : Scotch on the rocks and shrimp in the shell . Beef medallions , rare , with giant mushroom caps . Carrots , Cuisinart-sliced by Lloyd as the women enjoyed a second drink . Jenny 's dressing for the tossed salad  --  Maille mustard-with-seeds vinaigrette  --  left not a single excess drop on the plate . Small strawberries came with creme fraiche . Jenny served grapes with the coffee . <p> It was true that the Comricks could not have a baby . At sixteen , while on cruise aboard a schooner among the Aegean Isles , he had suffered mumps . ( " An ailment no longer in fashion , " he called it . ) A horse falling on her had damaged a kidney . Otherwise they were in perfect health and eager to start a family . <p> " We 'll meet every day , " Lloyd said . " Get to know each other to the point of boredom . Then you can decide . " <p> Audrey already knew that he was a Republican and an Episcopalian . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She liked him anyway . Even Republicans and Episcopalians , she assured herself , can be good parents . <p> Both their fathers were bankers . Their forefathers had come from Rhode Island ( Lloyd ) and Virginia ( Jenny ) to make printing presses and tractors . Audrey 's forefathers were from Kansas . Her parents taught eighth-grade math and English . <p> Jenny worked in a PR office and always guided the conversation to please her husband . She crouched because she was the taller . <p> Lloyd managed an estate : his own . He had inherited a box at the opera and a seat on the opera board . His name on letterheads was as ubiquitous as his generosity . He was innocent in his leisure and always behind in his reading . He was good with horses , dogs , children , cars and boats . He could not keep his hands off Jenny . <p> The three did indeed meet almost every day . <p> They went to the theater . To the Chicago City Ballet . The symphony . They planned to see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tharp . All worried about Baryshnikov 's knee . <p> Mostly they liked the same movies : The Killing Fields , Au Revoir Les Enfants , Cinema Paradiso , White Nights . Lloyd pretended to think favorably of The Color Purple . <p> They exchanged books ( the Comricks disliked Richard 's single tome ) , magazines , college records , club affiliations , blood types and family histories . ( Audrey 's older sister had four vigorous children . ) <p> They agreed that Audrey should not use a sperm bank . " No bottled sperm , " Jenny said . <p> Lloyd said , " I want it to be a love child . " <p> By Christmas week , Audrey needed no PR questionnaires nor help from her computer to tell her she was ready to reprogram her life . Her job for the coming year was to deliver a perfect child . <p> The family planning went smoothly until , after an excellent dinner at Audrey 's Presidential Towers apartment , she presented her production schedule . Depending , of course , upon start-up date , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May through September , maybe October-November , she would be in Paris . <p> " Paris ? " Lloyd exclaimed . Then , " Yes . You remembered . My year at the Sorbonne. 1982 . " <p> " But I want to visit the baby every day , " Jenny said . <p> " In utero ? " <p> " Talking to the baby is essential , " Jenny said . <p> Audrey was firm . " I 'm taking on this project to earn a sabbatical in Paris and to add to my nest egg . I want to start my own agency when I return . " <p> " I must visit the baby . " <p> " Jenny . " Lloyd patted her knee . " Jenny , you work every day . " <p> " I 'll visit evenings . " <p> " The baby 'd be asleep . We 'll visit . Often . I promise . " He kissed his wife . " We ca n't expect Audrey to have this baby here in front of everyone . " <p> " My best college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Audrey said . " Besides it 's difficult enough for a female executive .... " <p> " I know , " Jenny said and that was that . <p> " Now , money . " Lloyd blushed . " We propose a fee of one hundred thousand dollars . " <p> " Plus expenses , hospital and doctors . " <p> Audrey 's hand moved to her belly as if the child were already there . Lloyd topped her hand with his , then Jenny , then Audrey again and the parents-to-be . " Like a high-school pledge , " Audrey said . Neither Jenny nor Lloyd laughed . They signed the contract over late brandies . " Hey , Dad , " Jenny said , and then to Audrey , " You must be careful about alcohol . The baby . " <p> " As if it were my own . " <p> Audrey was not going to let just anybody father the child . Once she accepted the project , she set about its implementation with her usual finicky care : Gene research . Conception . Prenatal environment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goal  --  and the genesis of many a migraine headache  --  but in this particular assignment her theme was the old one : only gaining weight is more fun than getting pregnant . As a one-time assistant professor of philosophy at the University of Wisconsin-Stout , she did not anticipate an ethical problem . <p> Audrey suggested she would like access to the child to observe the interaction of heredity and environment . Lloyd was adamant . " We 'll send you a monthly report . " <p> Audrey already knew that any child she carried for the Comricks would never wave its arms nor jump about as she did . Such shows of emotion would be bred from the blood by positive reinforcement . She wondered if it would sidle like Jenny . Or would it , like her , joy in its own body ? Sometimes , just before dawn , the hour when even philosophers woke to questions they should answer , she wondered if she might help the Comricks but not accept their money . <p> The product file was almost complete . All that was needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> She had not dated seriously since Richard had interrupted her Commitment Speech with a discussion of Sartre . The men she knew in Chicago were like second-hand cars , rife with problems . She would have to comparison-shop . <p> The next Saturday night she dressed for The Limelight . Thigh-length leather skirt . Black camisole with pink ribbons . Fishnet stockings . Pictures of Madonna pasted above her eyelids , swatches of brocade on her fingernails . Then she lay on her bed and kicked off her purple pumps . Darkness would make it impossible to find the University of Chicago men . ( She was convinced academia was unmatched as a gene pool . ) She could never compete with the Limelight regular who wore a live cobra as a scarf . She did not want to give birth to something with a strobe-light twitch . The New Wave music might deafen it . Besides , the certified good health the Comricks demanded would require more quick-dancing than she knew . She stayed home and read In Search of Excellence . Jenny was already reading You and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Childbirth Education Center . <p> Sunday Audrey went to the Art Institute . One of her friends had followed a man , obviously an American ( it was summer and he wore white shoes in Paris ) from the d'Orsay to the Marmottan Museum by Metro . When she caught up with him in front of a water lily , she breathed deeply and murmured , " Oh , oh , oh , " until he said , " Let 's have tea . " His wedding gift was a loft on Printers Row . <p> Audrey , however , was not skilled at establishing eye contact . She had spent too many hours in the library ignoring men to be able now to brush her hand against the arm of the bearded youngster who stood beside her . She could never , like Cathy , the comic-strip single , have sent a prospect in a crowded restaurant a bowl of potato salad . <p> The father would have to be Richard . <p> She had already done gene research on Richard . All his family , three generations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes a morning . The darker hair and the two inches he had over Lloyd 's five-ten would be a good genetic input . She hoped Richard 's chin-dimple was dominant . She , Richard and Jenny would make up for Lloyd 's lack of professional commitment . Lloyd 's contribution would be his easy disposition , his enthusiasm for mechanical problems , and his devotion to family . Even Richard had his own brand of fidelity to offer : he was Big Brother to two boys from southwest Chicago . <p> Gene manipulation was proving more stimulating than three-dimensional chess . <p> She did not call Richard 's apartment in Evanston , nor his office at Northwestern . ( Office hours , Monday and Wednesday , 3-4 . ) He was reading a paper at the Philosophy Association Convention at the Palmer House at ten o'clock , Friday , December the twenty-seventh . A Philosychological Protasis : The Logic of Liberty . <p> Checking her calendar , she confirmed her expectation : late December was the optimum time to catch a baby . <p> She sat in the back row @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was taller than she remembered . His eyes were still deep and brown . " Epictetus the Stoic , " he began , " tells us that liberty is the right to live as we wish . " He smiled his sweet smile . A thumb fondled his beard . " Ethics suggests a certain decorum . " <p> When he saw her , he stroked his beard . " Aseity is not enough . " Then , speaking directly to her with his Richard-look ( " I do n't have to explain this to you " ) , he spelled it out . " Ass-ee-i-ty , a self-derived existence . " He spoke of Heidegger , Wittgenstein , St. Paul and Paul Feyerbend , with quotations from Shakespeare , Donne , T. S. Eliot , and , for Audrey 's sake , Gwendolyn Brooks ; His theme was : Ni dieu , ni maitre . <p> She wrote in her notebook , " Richard 's philosophy : I want what I want when I want it and I want it right now . " <p> When the colloquium broke for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She said , " I 've missed you . " <p> Talking with Richard the week he stayed with her was like returning to teaching minus the bloodletting at tenure time . Each day they talked faster and faster , later and later . He charted the path for her from Voltaire 's Candide to nihilism to existentialism to deconstruction and minimalism . He brought her up to date on the PoMo-Homo Conspiracy theory and the gossip about Foucault 's playing Russian roulette with unsafe sex in the bathhouses of San Francisco . In the mornings , as he lectured , she ground fresh coffee and cooked blueberry pancakes . In the evening , talking by the fire , they lay together on the hearth rug , happy as tumble bugs . She loved talking with Richard , loved loving with Richard , loved his musky smell . It was she who smoothed the sheets , pulled up the blankets as they snuggled in and slept . She picked up his towels in the bathroom and did n't fuss when she found clippings from his beard in the sink . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beard seemed to have developed a new sense of frugality so she cooked most of the meals . When he took her out , they ate Chinese . ( Richard was good with chopsticks ) . They took his little brothers to see A Christmas Carol and a hockey game . <p> He moved her chairs so they faced each other , catty-corner . She proofread his latest article , " From Candide to The Bonfire of the Vanities . " When she said , " Richard , you 're the last person in the world I 'd expect to match he and she to they , to abandon whom , " he misquoted Nietzsche : " So long as you believe in grammar , you 'll never get rid of God . " <p> Their last night in bed , she asked , " Do you truly believe in nothing ? I do n't mean as a philosopher , as a person . " <p> " Nothing out there but meaningless chaos . " <p> " Has n't it made your life barren ? " <p> " Not at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Day by day , watching myself , watching others . " He moved to top her . <p> " That 's deductive reasoning . Gathering information to prove what you think you already know . " <p> " Just checking , " he said as he settled in deeper . <p> Later he said , " Inductive means eliciting some reaction within an organism . " <p> The next morning , after their long goodbye-kiss , he said , " You 're the best of my lovers . I never have to explain . " <p> In her teaching days she 'd wondered if ideas were contagious . Richard said ethics had nothing to do with the messes people got themselves into . She did not want to be Like Richard . Grateful he was not staying , she Locked and double-locked the front door , slid in the security bar , and ran to return her furniture to straight lines , properly squared . <p> She sent him a card from Charles de Gaulle airport . Her large room at the Madison , overlooking Saint-Germain-des-Pres , was on the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a distant view of Sacre Coeur . So began her happiest time . <p> Jenny wrote , " My Family Focus Support Group says you should feel good about yourself ; otherwise you ca n't communicate a good feeling to the child . " <p> Sometimes at three in the morning Audrey thought of Richard with an uneasiness she understood all too well . If she could tell him about her pregnancy , would she become special , not just one of many ? She wished he could know the new richness of her breasts and thighs . ( Jenny : " It would be good now for you to have sex . Even ' an orgasm is safe . " She sent almond oil . " Rub this in each night . It prevents stretch marks . " ) <p> Paris was chill and damp . ( Jenny : " Please wear boots . " ) <p> Audrey walked all day , swinging along as if she were the Winged Victory . The child was not going to slouch if she could help it . ( Jenny : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trimester to give the baby a chance to be securely implanted . Now you must exercise regularly , but no jogging , no jumping . " ) <p> Audrey did not expect Yvonne , thin as Piaf in a black suit as intricately cut as a diamond , up from Lyons on the TGV to see her young friend Alain , to bring problems . Her friend was a Christmas-Eve Catholic . Besides , by now , the rightness of her project had come to seem self-evident . The two friends met at the Crillon . A waiter  --  obviously a duke during nonworking hours  --  poured tea . As Audrey explained her project , Yvonne began to sob . Her crying grew louder and louder , more wet and sloppy than seemed possible from such a small woman , until , at last , Audrey offered the duke a sheaf of bills and , abandoning their tea , they headed back to the Hotel Madison . Bony shoulders shaking , Yvonne sniffled and snuffled all the way , stamped her needle-heels , stopped every few feet to blow her nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> In Audrey 's room , each woman staring steadfastly out the window at Sacre Coeur instead of at each other , Audrey presented again her plans for her own agency and her need to be financially and psychologically self-sufficient . She described the Comricks ' sweet need and , hands cupping the ripe-melon swell of her breasts , she said , " There 's no true love in Richard . " She said , " I 've never felt so well . " <p> Yvonne , smoothing her skirt over meager thighs , said , " I 've never seen you so beautiful . " <p> The following evening they argued over cocktails and dinner at the Ritz , wine and snails at Tour d'Argent the next , until at last Yvonne said , " It is , chere amie , a little late to change your mind . " <p> At midnight they met Alain at the bottom of the stairs to Sacre Coeur and together they climbed to the terrace to see the city under a full moon . From this high place , all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like ships forever heading toward the sea . The renovated Eiffel Tower might have been a queen from a chessboard . For the first time , Audrey had grown fond of the light-spangled tower . No matter where she walked , a vista opened before her and there it would be , lighter and more exciting than ever . <p> It had been a sober evening , indeed a sober season for Audrey , yet hugging her knees , looking down at the life she was earning , breathing in the smells of spring , she grew drunk with moonlight . It seemed as if she had known her friend 's petit ami as long as Yvonne had . <p> " C'est vrai ? You are in Paris to have a baby ? " he asked . <p> " Mais oui . " <p> " And papa ? Where is papa ? " <p> Audrey 's Gallic shrug began with her feet and rolled up her spine . <p> " Combien ? " he asked . " How much for a baby ? " <p> " That 's my secret . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her project . <p> " You are a very beautiful woman , " he was saying . " I would like to take your picture . " <p> No one had ever asked to take her picture , but then she had not had a headache since early January . <p> " Now ? " <p> " And later . " <p> " But I 'll be thick . Then large . With child . " <p> " Please , " he said . <p> " Nonsense . " <p> " You will grow more beautiful with child . " <p> " No pictures . " <p> " It would help other women to see your strength . " He flipped a thumb at her as if by pictures alone she could help women everywhere . " I 'll be shooting with a telescopic lens , so far away you wo n't even see me . I 'll never show your face . " He was with Paris Match . The check was excessive . The moon over Paris was full . Alain to her left , Yvonne to her right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms and pulled them closer . No one in the philosophy department at Wisconsin Stout had ever proposed such an ethical dilemma . Richard was right : two steps down the slippery slope and the rest of the fall was fun . <p> Having helped her petit ami , Yvonne went to Majorca . Audrey resumed her solitary walks . Often , turning a beloved corner , she pretended to see Richard . He always said , " Audrey , you 're beautiful , " and then , being Richard , " What happened ? " At the tip of the Ile de la Cite , she ate a French loaf with ham , cheese , lettuce , pate and tomato ( Jenny : " Please do n't gain more then twenty-five pounds and cut down on salt " ) and lectured the fetus : " This is where Paris began . " At the Parvis de Notre Dame , she described the statues on the cathedral 's facade , especially the little devil who with his thumb tipped the scales of Judgment Day to win more souls for his master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . " We 'll go there tomorrow . " <p> Richard sent her his critique of Paul K. Feyerbend , which denied the authority of method and science in a free society . In a small Chinese restaurant behind the Cluny , she propped Richard 's article against her black mushrooms-with-ginger and thought about his hands , so deft with chopsticks , so deft in her body . " So , Richard , no God , no master , no method , no science . What now ? " <p> Richard knew what he was saying : there is nothing in the universe except myself and I 'm not much . But he did n't feel it . He did n't care . Even if she could tell him about her project , and she could n't because she 'd promised not to , he 'd probably think being a biological father was meaningless . Looking ahead to the days when she must leave Paris , she promised herself never to be like Richard . <p> Jenny telephoned . It was two A.M. in Paris . " I forgot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tar can cause birth defects . " <p> One warm June night , Audrey lay on her bed and listened to the sounds from the street below . Girls giggled , then screamed . Young men shouted , " Merde alors . " Motorcycles roared and brakes screamed . Fists struck flesh . The fetus within her moved and she thought about Richard , smelled his aftershave , saw Richard , naked , reaching down for his slippers , his body 's cleft so vulnerable . <p> She bought another purple pantsuit , this one maternity-style with a full top that swung as she walked . She bought low shoes and , forgoing a permanent , braided her hair in a fat black pigtail . Thus clad , she took the fetus to the new Picasso museum in the Marais . To the Victor Hugo . Giverny . Chartres . Versailles . The American Embassy to pay their respects to Ben Franklin 's statue in the courtyard . Mornings , when it rained , she read aloud from Flaubert and de Maupassant , newspapers from left to right : Le Canard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Le Monde . A child should have perspective ; the closer Lloyd came to fatherhood , the more conservative he became . <p> She wrote Jenny , " I 'm beginning to walk like a duck . " <p> As Lloyd had promised , he and Jenny visited every month . Jenny always checked Audrey 's pulse ; she never counted more than seventy-two beats per minute . Audrey retraced her walks with them . She showed them the graffiti behind Shakespeare and Company : Rends-moi le sperme de mon mari . ( If Richard knew what she was doing , would he ask her to return his sperm ? ) <p> The three of them discussed the dangers of spiral staircases . " We 'll move , " Lloyd said . <p> " Hey , Dad , " Jenny said . " You 're right , " <p> " Do you sleep on your side ? " she asked Audrey . " It directs more blood to the uterus . " She bought half a dozen Dior support hose for Audrey . She showed her how to lie on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worried because Audrey was living in the cholesterol capital of the world . <p> " And Saint-Germain-des-Pres is so noisy , " Lloyd said . " Noise can hurt a baby . " Audrey suggested she visit Yvonne , home again in her small villa near Lyons , for the Last month of her pregnancy . <p> They stood before the Sainte Chapelle . " I explained to the baby about the thumb under the scale , " Audrey said . ( This was the first time she 'd referred to the fetus as baby . ) <p> " Audrey , do you believe in hell ? " Lloyd asked . <p> She and Jenny answered in unison . " Not after life . " <p> They decided that once Audrey delivered , she would stay in Paris for a month before going back to work . Truly , the scales of life had tipped in her favor . <p> " Be sure to keep up with your Lamaze , " Jenny said . " Asking Lloyd to help would demand too much . It 's up to you to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the least possible trauma . No drugs . " And then , " I envy you so . " <p> Audrey delivered at the American Hospital in Paris at four in the morning , September ten . The three of them , Jenny and Lloyd and Audrey , joined hands over Audrey 's belly and Jenny and Lloyd matched their deep breaths to hers . It was a normal birth . Afterwards , Jenny and Lloyd laughed and cried and stroked the baby 's bald head . <p> Alone at her desk in her new office , red pencil slashing at her first layout , Audrey was doing what she did best : product development . With a thumb she lifted a photo and eased it down one-sixteenth of an inch , then , mock-up in hand , she paced the small room . Last April this two-year lease had seemed a bargain : one hundred and ninety-six square feet with a window to the lake , $24 a month per square foot , total $112,896 , not much more than the price of a baby . Now the office felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> She had made an analysis in depth of the French way of making rumpled boxer shorts erotic ; the promotion-crumpled green-gray shorts beside a champagne glass on a crimson carpet-had come out exactly as she had planned ; she hated it . With her usual precision , she initialed the layout , placed it face down on her desk , and , small hammers pounding in her temples , picked up sketches for her next project . Her real job in the years to come , she knew this now , was never to beg to see the child . <p>
