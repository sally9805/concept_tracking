<p> The stock market is not a safe place right now . Still , history tells us that the best time to invest in stocks is during the middle of a recession because that 's when stock prices bottom out . <p> Trouble is , you wo n't know when stock prices have hit bottom until after they 've started rising again . <p> So here 's an idea : Invest now in a stock mutual fund that has a good long- term track record but currently is keeping a lot of its money parked on the sidelines in cash - money market securities and short-term Treasury notes . Leave it to the fund manager to decide when it 's time to begin moving back into stocks and - perhaps more important - what to buy . <p> A handful of stock funds fit the bill . Mind you , these are not simply market-timer funds . True market timers are either all in or all out of stocks , depending on what their market-timing signals say . They are much more concerned with being in or out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual stocks to buy . They spend time monitoring technical data on the economy and markets , not companies . <p> Instead , these are funds run by die-hard stock pickers who , because of lofty stock prices last spring and summer , were unable to find stocks and the bargain prices that their screening methods demand . So the fund managers decided to lock in some gains and keep a lot of the fund in cash . <p> Jim Manley of Vista Growth &; Income is typical . " I run the fund as I would run my own money , " says Manley . " I had a very strong two-year track record and made a lot of money for our shareholders . When the market started getting too risky , I decided to preserve our shareholders ' capital just like I would my own . " <p> His fund has 63% of its money in money market securities . By comparison , the average stock fund has just 10.2% of its money in cash , according to the Investment Company Institute . <p> Vista , which opened in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 14.4% for the average stock fund , and rose 57% in 1989 , vs. 24% for the average fund . As of Oct. 26 , it 's down 4.9% this year while the average stock fund is down 16% . " There are plenty of funds that do very well when the market is up but give a lot of it back when the market 's down . I do n't want to be one of those , " Manley says . <p> Manley does n't consider himself a market timer . " Timers make money by timing the market swings and use indicators to tell them when to get in and out , " he says . " I make money through careful stock selection . " Manley says he wo n't begin buying stocks again until short-term interest rates , controlled by the Federal Reserve , begin falling sharply and official economic reports say the economy is well into a recession . <p> Many funds have restrictions on how big a percentage of their money they can keep in money market securities - interest-paying instruments that mature in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oppenheimer Blue Chip , has 35% in cash - the maximum allowed by her fund 's prospectus . Wilder says the worst of the bear market is over - " 85% to 90% of the drop is behind us " - but expects the market to be stuck at its low level for several more quarters . <p> Picking one of the funds has a risk : They are n't likely to rush 100% back into stocks at once . " So when stocks take off , they wo n't rise as quickly as a fund that 's 100% invested in stocks , " says Don Phillips , editor of Mutual Fund Values , which tracks fund performance and cash levels . " But it 's pretty demoralizing putting yourself into a 100%-invested fund right now . " <p> If stocks keep falling , you 'd watch your investment fall and be tempted to pull money out - a mistake many make . <p> " You 're better off going with a good stock picker who 's sitting on a lot of cash and sleeping better at night than putting money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out later , " Phillips says . <p> One caveat , however : Do n't invest until after the fund makes its annual year-end distribution of capital gains and dividends - typically in the last three weeks of December . As the dividends and the gains from selling stocks pile up during the year , they push up the fund 's share price . When the fund pays out the dividends and gains to its investors , its share price falls by the amount of the distribution . So if you invest just before the distribution , you 'll soon get back part of your investment in the form of an annual distribution . What 's worse , you 'll have to pay income tax on the distribution because it is considered taxable income . So before investing , call a fund to find out its distribution date . <p> TEXT OF GRAPHIC Best bets for waiting it out Managers of some of the best stock funds of the past few years think it 's a bad time to have a lot of money in stocks .
