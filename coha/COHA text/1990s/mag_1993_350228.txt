First it was just his diaries that were laid open . In recent weeks lawyers for the Senate ethics committee have combed through 5,000 pages of Senator Robert Packwood 's private journal . " Are there personal things in there ? " Packwood lamented last week . " Sure . Family heartaches . Disappointments . Irritation with the car repairman . " There was more than that : word emerged from the committee that the diaries , which of course range far beyond the scope of the sexual-misconduct charges he faces , may in fact contain evidence of unrelated criminal violations . Last Monday Packwood responded to such reports by insisting , " For the life of me I do not understand . . . whatever this other thing may be that may be criminal . " But within 24 hours he reversed himself , allowing , " The issue was employment opportunities for my wife and whether there was some quid pro quo on legislation . " <P> And now an equally intimate record of Packwood 's life is drawing scrutiny : his divorce papers . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he illegally used his position to get his ex-wife Georgie a job in order to save himself hefty alimony payments . <P> The Senate , doggedly pursuing the remaining 3,200 pages of Packwood 's diaries , voted 94 to 6 last week to authorize the ethics committee to seek a federal court order compelling the Senator to turn over the journals . If the committee gets hold of those pages and finds sufficient evidence , Packwood may soon be in his deepest trouble yet . Although the sexual-harassment charges under investigation by the committee carry no threat of criminal prosecution , - the same can not be said for the allegations surrounding his possible misuse of office . Last week Packwood denied ever wrongfully soliciting work for his ex- wife , but the six members of the bipartisan committee seem bent on investigating and reaching their own conclusion . <P> The Packwoods ' divorce papers shed light on the Senator 's discussions about his wife 's employment . The records , filed with the circuit court in the Multnomah County courthouse in Oregon , show that while Georgie did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under state law , contest her husband 's petition citing " irreconcilable differences . " After the couple separated in January 1990 , they wrangled about alimony . Packwood claimed that he was virtually broke and proposed monthly payments of $500 . Georgie demanded $4,000 . Eventually the court settled on $2,500 , based in part on a calculation of Georgie 's earning ability . At the time , she was running Plain ' n Fancy , a $12,000-a-year antiques business based in her Washington home . <P> In the year between the Packwoods ' separation and their divorce trial , Georgie received job offers from four of the Senator 's friends . " I had not asked any of these people for a job , " Georgie told the Washington Post last week . Those offers came from two Washington lobbyists , each of whom had approached Packwood on behalf of clients ; an investment banker who had gone to law school with Packwood and raised campaign funds for him ; and a businessman who once served on Packwood 's staff .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
