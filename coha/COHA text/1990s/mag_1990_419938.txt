<p> Proper planning in the fall assures success in the spring <p> SPRING BULBS  --  whether crocuses or trilliums  --  flower as soon as the ground has begun to warm but before the leaves on deciduous trees and shrubs have expanded . At that time they are sure of getting the attention of whatever insects are about , but this rush to flower has its price . Only species that can store food from the previous growing season , and that have preformed flowers waiting in bud , can take advantage of the first warm weather to bloom . There are several types of garden-variety bulbs , and they differ widely in structure see " What Is  --  and Is n't  --  a Bulb ? " on page 43 , but an understanding of their common origins in the wild will help with their culture . <p> The majority of our spring bulbs come from a rather narrow area around the Mediterranean Sea , from Portugal arid Spain in the west , and through the Middle East to Afghanistan and central Asia . The area is characterized by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hot , dry summer . There are regular rains between September and April but generally none between May and August . During the hot and dry summer the plants are dormant . Then , in fall and winter , when the soil is cool and moist they grow new roots and mature their flower buds . Flowers appear roughly three months later , or whenever soil and air temperatures begin to rise . Vegetative growth and the storage of food for the following year is completed in the short period between flowering and the time when the soil dries out in the summer . Crocuses , daffodils , and tulips conform to this life cycle , as do many of the so-called minor bulbs , like grape hyacinths and snowdrops . They are all plants of grasslands or scrub , Fall-flowering species of Crocus and Colchicum differ only in that they bloom at about the time that new roots are being initiated . <p> Bulb plants native to areas such as South Africa , where summer rainfall is more profuse , can wait to bloom until a new store of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such plants , almost all found on the edges of grasslands or woodlands , typically have tall stems or flowering spikes so that flowers and leaves are raised above the surrounding vegetation and displayed in the sunlight . Species of Gladiolus , Galtonia , and Lilium are typical examples . <p> A third group of spring bulbs are the woodland plants that bloom and complete growth before the forest canopy of deciduous leaves cuts off their supply of sunlight . These include Anemone bland , spring beauties ( Claytonia species ) , wood hyacinths ( Endymion species ) , winter aconites ( Eranthis species ) , bluebells ( Mertensia Species ) , bloodroots ( Sanguinaria species ) , and Trillium species . Because woodlands tend to have an even distribution of rainfall throughout the year , bulbous plants growing there are not usually subjected to moisture stress . They are therefore particularly sensitive to drying out while being handled in commerce . Getting Started <p> If the area you are planting is naturally well drained , soil preparation need involve only the top six to 12 inches . Dig out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rhizomes of coarse perennial weeds . If the area is covered with grass , strip the sod from the soft and compost it elsewhere . Next , cover the area with four to six inches of compost , well-rotted manure , or finely chopped organic matter ( such as leaves or grass ) , and apply a commercial 5-10-5 fertilizer at the rate of two pounds per 100 square feet . This is a lower rate than is generally recommended , but I prefer to do this rather than take the risk of burning the bulbs ' tender roots . Dig the amendments into the soil with a spade , or till them in with a rototiller . If at any time of the year water stands on the surface of the soil , you will have to take the more drastic action of installing drains or raising the planting bed above the soil surface . <p> A good mixture for a raised bed is two parts screened loam and one part compost , manure , or finely chopped organic matter , with one pound per three cubic yards of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this mix on the surface of the ground . Edge the bed with bricks , stones , or landscape timbers , or simply let it slope down to the original ground surface . Planting <p> The chin on pages 48 and 49 is a rough guide for the depth at which individual species should be planted . Depth in some cases is not critical . The contractile roots of crocuses , for example , will pull the corms to the correct depth . <p> All the evidence we have indicates that spring bulbs will tolerate frozen soil in the winter , but do not need it and are not improved by it . You should therefore mulch your bulb plantings heavily each fall , and leave it on for the remainder of the year . The much should be of some organic material that breaks down quickly . Compost , part ally decayed leaves , sawdust , stable manure , or hay are all good for this purpose . Apply a complete fertilizer ( 5-10-10 or 10-10-10 ) at the rate of one-half pound per 100 square feet either before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March to help ensure vigorous vegetative growth . This growth will in turn help the plant manufacture food to support flower production for the year . Why Bulbs Sometimes Fail <p> Because spring  --  flowering , bulbs are sold with a flower-bud already formed , they are among the most sure-fire bloomers . Now and then , however , much to a gardener 's dismay , a particular batch of bulbs will not come up , will not flower , or will not flower until the following year . There are a number of factors that can lead to bulb failure . <p> 1 . Storage Sortie companies store or display bulbs in bins and boxes that are too hot or dry . Bulbs are adapted to summer soil temperatures below 80 degrees Fahrenheit . If temperatures during storage exceed 80 degrees for very long , the flower buds , t least , are likely to be killed . Tulips are particularly sensitive in this regard . Daffodils and narcissus on the other hand are quite heat-tolerant . <p> Bulbs are also adapted to low amounts of moisture in the soil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are bone dry . The longer they are displayed for sale , the more water they lose , and the lower their chances for survival . <p> For these reasons , you should purchase bulbs as soon as they are available and plant them immediately . 2 . Drainage Always plant bulbs in soil that is well drained throughout the year . If you plant them in saturated soils  --  under the drip-line of the eaves of the house , for example  --  they are almost certain to drown or rot in the excess water . 3 . Animals Mice , chipmunks , squirrels , and other animals enjoy eating some bulbs . Trying to trap these pests is usually impractical . Chemical repellents work to some degree , but the most effective control is to keep a cat or a dog . <p> Daffodil and narcissus bulbs are unpalatable and are therefore the bulbs of choice for gardeners who have problems with bulb-eating animals and can do without tulips . For those who can not , plant tulip bulbs inside a shallow box made from half-inch galvanized hardware cloth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow up through the mesh but the animals will not be able to destroy the bulbs . 4 . Photosynthesis If bulbs are to flower from year to year , they must have full sun on their leaves for as long as the leaves are functional in order to manufacture food . On no account should you cut off green leaves or tie them up . Yes , daffodils and tulips are untidy . Learn to live with them . They give you bright colors when you need them most . 5 . Soil Temperature . The main reason that tulips do not persist in gardens in the Deep South is that the soil becomes too warm during the summer . Both tulips and daffodils will fail to form buds for next year 's bloom if soil temperature at the time is much above 70 degrees . This is more of a problem for tulips , however , became they form their buds in midsummer . Daffodils form buds in the spring immediately after flowering . A generous mulch wilt help cool the ground in warmer regions . Forcing <p> Bulbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best for forcing , and they can all be treated similarly . Pot the bulbs up in September or October in a mixture containing one part compost or soilless mix , one part ordinary garden soil , and one part perlite . Next , water the bulbs well and place them in a location with cool temperatures ( 35 to 45 degrees ) for three months . This could be a root cellar , a well-mulched cold frame , or even the food compartment ( not the freezer ) of your refrigerator . Do not allow the soil to dry out at any time . <p> After three months of cold treatment , move the pots to a cool , light location with a temperature of 50 to 55 degrees . Leaves and buds will soon appear . A modest increase in temperature will speed up the process . It is wise to remember , however , that the more rapidly the bulbs are forced , the shorter the flowering period because plants normally flower when the air temperature is still relatively cool . <p> Bulbs force in the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crocuses come very quickly , daffodils and hyacinths more slowly , and Darwin tulips more slowly still . Plants that flower later in the spring or even in early summer Easter lilies , for example  --  can be forced , but they take a relatively long time . <p> After the flowers have faded , keep the pots in a sunny window and give them some liquid fertilizer . Do not allow them to dry out . As soon as danger of hard frost is past , turn the bulbs and soil out of the pots and plant them as a unit in the gar den . Crocuses , daffodils , and hyacinths will establish readily and give you many years of pleasure . Tulips are chancy .

DeWolf <p> <p> Gordon R DeWolf is a contributing editor of this magazine and a longtime instructor of horticulture . <p> WHAT IS  --  AND IS N'T  --  A BULB <p> The term bulb is commonly used to describe an assortment of herbaceous perennials , all of which have some sort of swollen food-storage structure at or below ground level . But not every so-called bulb is a bulb in the botanical sense . An onion ( a bulb ) and a gladiolus ( a corm ) are constructed quite differently . The following breakdown of common " bulbs " into more technically correct categories should clear up some of the confusion . Bulb A bulb is an upright ; vertical , modified bud consisting of a short , thick stem whose internodes ( the sections between leaves ) have not elongated . Attached to the stem are crowded , fleshy leaf bases that are used to store food . Among the various kinds of bulbs and related structures are : Scaly Bulb A bulb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tunicated Bulb A bulb of this type has scales forming continuous layers around each other . Generally the outermost scales form a dry , membranous covering . Daffodils ( Narcissus species ) , onions ( Allium species ) , and tulips ( Tulipa species ) are all examples of tunicated bulbs produced below the surface of the soil . Amaryllis ( Hippeastrum species ) and milk-and-wine lilies ( Crinum latifolium var. zeylanicum ) are examples of tunicated bulbs developed at or above the surface of the soil . Bulbil A bulbil is a bulblike or tuberlike structure that is borne in the axil of a leaf on aboveground stems . It may be small or large . Bulbils are best known for occurring on tiger lilies ( Lilium lancifolium ) , but they also occur on hardy begonias ( Begonia grandis ) and true yams ( Dioscorea species ) . Bulblet A small , nonflowering offset of either a bulb or a corm . Bulblets occur on shallots , gladioluses , and crocuses . Corm A corm is a vertical , solid , swollen stem with somewhat developed internodes . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and leaves , and on the sides in the axils of the bases of last year 's leaves are lateral buds that may form small offsets or bulblets . The roots are produced from the bottom . A corm uses up all of its stored food to produce a crop of flowers and fruits during the year and then initiates the growth of one or more replacement corms . The roots that develop at the base of the new corm are contractile , meaning they pull the new corm(s) down into the hole left by the decay of the parent corm . Crocuses and gladioluses are examples . Erect Rhizome An erect rhizome is a swollen , elongated underground stem producing both apical and lateral buds . Rootlets are produced all around the stem just below the apical bud . This bud progressively sends up stems or leaves that last for only one season . As the apex grows upward , the base decays and the contractile rootlets pull the new stem back down into the hole left by the decay of the older portion . In calla lilies ( Zantedeschia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iris rhizome stood on end , as do those of trilliums , while the erect rhizomes of jack-in-the-pulpit ( Arisaema triphyllum ) and voodoo lily ( Sauromatum guttatum ) produce structures that mimic tubers or corms . Rhizome This is a horizontal stem frequently confused with roots , and frequently called a rootstalk . It lies prostrate on the surface of the ground or underground , sending off roots from its lower sides , and stems or leaves from its tip . The stems and leaves may last for a single season or may be perennial or evergreen . Common garden irises and Solomon 's seal ( Polygonatum species ) have thickened rhizomes with terminal stems or leaves that are annual . Agapanthus and Clivia species have thickened rhizomes and a terminal cluster of evergreen leaves . Sobole Also called an unthickened rhizome , a sobole is an elongated , horizontal , underground stem . It roots at the nodes and sends up stems or leaves from its tip . The stems and leaves may be annual or perennial . Lily of the valley ( Convallaria majalis ) , mint ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all produce erect annual stems or leaves . Sumac ( Rhus glabra and R. typhina ) produces erect , perennial , woody stems . <p> In fact , most perennials that produce increasing numbers of annual stems as the years pass ( Monarda , Chelone , Dianthus , and Arabis species , for example ) have soboles . Lilacs ( Syringa species ) , Iberis species , holly grapes ( Mahonia species ) , and sweet shrubs ( Calycanthus species ) have perennial , woody , erect stems arising from soboles. 10 . Tuber A tuber is a thick , enlarged , horizontal portion of an underground branch ( rhizome or sobole ) . It usually has prominent buds ( eyes ) on its sides . The structure is produced in one growing season and in the following growing season is completely used up in the production of a new plant . Irish potatoes ( Solanum tuberosum ) and Jerusalem artichokes ( Helianthus tuberosus ) are two common examples . 11 . Tuberous Rhizome This is a short , thick structure that produces leaves and stems from its upper surface and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by lateral buds . Eranthis species , Anemone coronaria , and Anemone blanda are examples . 12 . Tuberous Root This is more or less a thickened root , Carrots ( Daucus carota ) are thickened taproots , Sweet potatoes ( Ipomoea batatas ) , Dahlia species , and Ranunculus asiaticus are examples of thickened lateral or secondary roots . 13 . Tuberous Stem Also called a tuber-corm , this is a more or less disc-shaped or top-shaped structure , that bears one or more buds on its upper surface ( which may be concave , convex , or fiat ) and usually produces annual crops of roots on its lower surface . Unlike a corm or tuber , it is a perennial structure , increasing in size with age . However , it does not usually branch or produce offsets . It is formed from the swollen hypocotyl ( or stem ) of the seedling with a few of the first stem nodes and internodes and the top of the root . Cyclamens , tuberous begonias ( Begonia x tuberhybrida ) , and gloxinias ( Sinningia speciosa ) are examples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Brassica rapa ) are examples of biennial vegetables . <p> DIAGRAM : 1 . bulb <p> DIAGRAM : 2. lily <p> DIAGRAM : 3. tulip <p> DIAGRAM : 4. lily <p> DIAGRAM : 5. shallot <p> DIAGRAM : 6. gladiolus <p> DIAGRAM : 7. jack-in-the-pulpit <p> DIAGRAM : 8 .
