DOES HEAVEN EXIST ? <P> " Yes , there is a heaven . We create it every day when we protect a child , help an adult and revere our home , the earth . " GEORGE A. ERICKSON New Brighton , Minnesota <P> I 've come to accept heaven as an eternal gift for attempting to live my life with God , not man , as my mentor RELIGION , March 24 . As with any gift , knowing what 's under the wrappings before the designated time removes all the joy of the unwrapping intended by the giver . If heaven has no relationship to time , space or place , why waste human energy trying to put it in a box . Such are the matters of faith . ROBERT L. MINNER Broomfield , Colorado <P> Excellent topic ! I truly enjoyed reading " Does Heaven Exist ? " I am a devout Christian , and I do n't give much thought to heaven . My spirituality is n't based on an anthropomorphic , kick-butt God who will throw four generations of children into eternal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the flip side of the absolutely barbaric notion of hell that evolved under that kick-butt mind-set . <P> Hell is just plain inconsistent with the tradition of mysticism that brought me into the faith in the first place . To me , God is a symbol for something unfathomable , an utter mystery that fills my heart with joy and my spirit with song . TRISH CARR Portland , Oregon <P> I find it comical that you chose to ask scholars about heaven when those truly educated on the subject are dead . CHRISTIN LEE , age 14 West Hills , California <P> Congratulations on your inspiring cover story . Yet nowhere did the story even hint at the millions of Christians , Jews , Muslims , Hindus , Buddhists , agnostics and atheists worldwide who may have had a glimpse of heaven  --  a near-death experience  --  and lived to tell about it if we had taken the time to listen . For thousands of years , these people have told us of meeting loved ones , of undergoing instantaneous , panoramic life reviews of every thought and deed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others , and encountering the Light , which has transformed their lives . BRUCE J. HORACEK Omaha , Nebraska <P> Surveys show Americans at times envision heaven as a place like home and , surprisingly often , as a place where baseball is played ( even prior to the 1989 release of Field of Dreams ) . This U.S. concept brings us closer to the views of Polynesians and the Balinese , who envision a heaven much like their islands but without illness . JEANNETTE BELLIVEAU Baltimore , Maryland <P> HEAVEN IN SURVEYSPEAK <P> David Van Biema did a wonderful job of writing " Does Heaven Exist ? " RELIGION , March 24 . Yet the impact is lost when you include a chart of a telephone poll that purports to tell readers what America thinks . This is surveyspeak , polltalk at its most ridiculous . If there are 250 million people in the U.S. , your polltakers reached 0.000407% of the population . To permit such balderdash when dealing with heaven and hell , you risk a lot . JOHN VAN DOORN New York City <P> So 43% expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only 6% believe good deeds alone will get them there . Welcome to the new Dark Ages !
