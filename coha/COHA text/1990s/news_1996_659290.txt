<p> This is town meeting country , where generations of independent-minded , tight-fisted Yankees have risen from their wooden benches to discuss , debate and finally vote Yea or Nay on great questions of local governance . <p> Such as : Is the town truck one bump away from the junkyard , or good for at least another 10,000 miles ? <p> But in this presidential election year , these same voters , notorious for scrutinizing their own public finances to the penny , are n't much worked up about that perennial whipping boy - big , bad government . <p> " It 's not a prime issue for me , " Sandy Barney , 33 , said one afternoon as she stopped at the Hampton General Store for milk . " It 's not going to save me , and it 's not going to kill me . " <p> " The government is so large it does n't make any difference who 's in charge , " said Art Kirschenbaum , 54 , sitting on the hood of his car outside . " It 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to change mine . I 'm more concerned about whether I can get the school bus to come down my street so my kid wo n't have to walk up to the main road . " <p> Bob Dole says he wants to reduce government involvement in American life by cutting federal spending , regulation , and taxes . Although President Clinton also says he favors smaller , more efficient government , he mentioned more than 20 governmental initiatives in his speech at the Democratic convention . <p> In 1994 , when asked to choose between two statements , 56 percent of American voters chose " government is doing too many things better left to individuals and businesses , " while only 41 percent agreed that " government should do more to solve national problems . " <p> But why has " big government " lost its political pop in this cradle of the Colonial revolt against taxation without representation ? <p> Partly because people are tired of the issue ; if even Ronald Reagan did n't shrink the government , they say , sometime-liberal Clinton and longtime Washington insider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put it , " It 'd take a revolution to really reduce the federal government , and I do n't think either of these guys are revolutionaries . " <p> But there is another factor in their resignation : the decline of Hampton 's own town meeting , which has made people here more sympathetic to bureaucracy and more aware of the frailties of all government - big , small and in between . <p> Hampton is a quiet , dignified town in the rural hills of eastern Connecticut , with a white , slender-steepled Congregational church , miles of old stone walls and a library that folks let themselves into on the librarian 's day off . The population is about 1,600 , just a few hundred more than when the town was incorporated in 1785 . <p> Hampton has 329 declared Republicans , 315 Democrats , one Libertarian and 315 unaffiliateds . In 1988 , Michael Dukakis became the first Democratic presidential candidate since the Civil War to carry the town and , four years later , Clinton repeated the trick . <p> In principle , people here hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll tell you how the Sandy Hill Bridge reconstruction will cost $ 100,000 more because of a federal rule that calls for unnecessary steel sheathing on the footings , and how a federally required archaeological study has delayed the Old King 's Highway bridge project for months . <p> But they seem to doubt that either candidate possesses the will and the means to do much about it . <p> Donald Geer , at 61 the town 's last dairy farmer and a pretty fair barnyard philosopher , summed up the local view : " I think we 'll probably have slightly more government with Clinton than with Dole . " But he did n't sound worried : " At times that 's been good , at times it 's been bad . " He 'll vote for Dole , mostly because of his war record and his character . <p> Behind the town 's surprisingly muted feelings about big government is the decline of an uniquely American political institution , one that dates back to the earliest days of the Massachusetts Bay Colony - the New England town meeting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attended his first . He liked what he heard : " All the arguing pro and con , all these people expressing opinions . It was packed - no place to sit , no place to stand . <p> " You had strong personalities who took on the town as their own . Even if you did n't speak , they 'd make your point , pro-education , or anti-education . Some wanted to give a blank check , others would n't give it a dime . Someone would tell someone else , ' You 've got more money than God ! ' or make a comment about a speaker 's ponytail . " <p> But now , says James Robertson , a retired history professor and frequent town meeting moderator , " We have fewer town meetings , and a sense of less to do at them , of fewer items on the call " - the term for the meeting 's agenda . <p> The highlight of the political year used to be the town meeting where the budget was voice-voted up or down . But for the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approved via referendum , with the town meeting reduced to a public hearing beforehand . <p> Says Walter Stone , a veteran selectman : " You ca n't get people to come . You 'd have 900 in the old days , 200 even a few years ago . Now you get 50 and 20 of ' em are town employees or school board members . " <p> " Now we all have to work until 8 o'clock to make ends meet and we ca n't be at a meeting that starts at 7 , " explains Berard . Or they ca n't find a baby sitter or just want to watch TV . <p> But it 's more than apathy - it 's anger . <p> Several voters said they felt uncomfortable with the increasingly hostile give-and-take of the town meeting . Big-ticket items like education have pitted more affluent newcomers against old-timers on fixed incomes , highlighting the fact that Hampton has become just another bedroom community . <p> " It used to be " I have my opinion and you have yours , ' " says Georgia Rondeau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Now it 's , ' You 're a jerk ! ' " <p> Here is the seed of bigger government : a body politic too busy , too apathetic or simply too uncomfortable to handle the details of governance , a body politic that turns its prerogatives over to someone else . <p> As the town meeting has declined , town government has grown . <p> Once , the probate judge and tax collectors worked out of their homes and the other officials were crammed into one room . Now , the town is its own largest employer , and its officials - including Berard , a part-time building inspector , and his wife , the assistant tax collector - fill most of a renovated school . <p> Where once selectmen handed out charity , picked up stray dogs and did all the paperwork , now there is a social services director and an animal control officer and a secretary . <p> No one has serious complaints about these public servants , and the referendum is certainly a form of direct democracy . But everyone acknowledges something has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his barn , lamenting the growth of the federal government , he says it all comes down to a lack of personal responsibility . Yet when Jim Robertson , the retired historian , ponders the demise of the town meeting , he sees the same problem . <p> " It 's a giving up of individual responsibility for participating in government , " he says . " People have removed themselves from the democratic process , said they want to leave these issues to other people . And I am sorry about that . "
