Even in a sick Korean economy you can make money going against the grain . This fellow does it importing American technology <p> WHEN HIS 24-YEAR-OLD SON went swishing down an icy Korean ski slope three years ago , Mahn-Jick Lim did what comes naturally and swished after him . Bam ! Lim injured the same ribs he 'd broken on a Colorado mountain a few months earlier . <p> " I like to do daring stuff , " says Lim , now 59 . A North Korean native whose family moved to Seoul during the Japanese occupation and rode out the Korean War there , Lim is no stranger to peril . But his riskiest feat may have been to give up a comfy life as a researcher in New Jersey a decade ago to set up a business in Seoul . <p> " My friends thought I was crazy , " recounts Lim . " I had a very good job . A good life . ' Why would you even think of leaving ? ' they 'd ask . " <p> It 's not an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the won collapsing and the economy on the verge of recession  --  but Lim was not so crazy . His family-owned firm , MJL Korea , netted $3.9 million on revenue of $37 million last year from sales of U.S. software and hardware . Despite the local turmoil , Lim expects sales to grow 22% this year , to $45 million . He has succeeded by doing everything that 's not supposed to work in Korea  --  importing American products , luring top talent with financial incentives and penetrating the chaebol ( conglomerates ) . <p> MJL 's stock-in-trade is things like Altera Corp . ' s programmable logic devices , Centigram Communications ' voice , fax and E-mail forwarding systems and Ascend Communications ' wide area network switches ( the switches funnel data between Internet users and service providers ' high-speed communications lines ) . Household names these are not , but unlike Korea 's struggling makers of me-too products such as cars and memory chips , Lim 's firm sticks to things others ca n't easily copy . That often means gaining exclusive Korean distribution rights and painstakingly adapting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Consider Korea Telecom 's nationwide Internet network . Lim 's engineers spent nine months working with Korea Telecom and Ascend to get the U.S. firm 's Internet switches to work with Korea 's telephone protocols , which are rather unlike the ones found in North America . When Korea Telecom picked SsangYong Information &; Communications as its main contractor , MJL won $2.8 million in business installing Ascend switches . <p> The nine-year-old MJL could retire its $4.5 million in debt with less than one year 's earnings . Contrast it with the chaebol , which have collapsed like dominoes recently after expanding recklessly and racking up huge debts . So weak and overleveraged have been Korean corporations that the shareholders ' equity of many has been declining consistently for years . <p> " Big Korean companies often fail by getting into businesses they do n't understand , " says Lim . " From the outset I 've made sure there 's a synergy among my products . " <p> A chemical engineering graduate of Seoul National University , Korea 's Harvard , Lim earned a Ph.D . in engineering science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lim spent the next two decades at the AT &T; Engineering Research Center in Princeton , N.J. Since a lot of Lim 's work there involved developing and manufacturing new semiconductors , he scoured U.S. startups for the latest technology . <p> " In the memory business , if you pick the wrong stepper a device used in chip-making , your company fails , " says Lim . " I gained lots of experience evaluating small companies ' technologies and finances . " <p> A rapid-fire talker whose father started a newspaper and a tiremaking business , Lim had long wanted to work for himself . He figured his skills would be in greatest demand in South Korea , with its pressing need for leading-edge technology and its spotty record employing it ( see box , p. 210 ) . <p> In 1987 Korean firms were just beginning to compete with Americans and Japanese in computers and other high-end electronics . Success meant mastering new technologies . Lim approached Altera , an upstart in the then-emerging field of programmable logic chips . These make it possible to install custom programs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a huge cost . <p> Lim 's enthusiasm won him exclusive Korean distribution rights for Altera 's product line . He quit AT &T,; returned to Seoul and dipped into savings to rent a small office . After a struggle he managed to lure one new engineering graduate as a salesman . Within two weeks they 'd landed a $500,000 order . <p> That put MJL in the black its first quarter , but the sacrifices were n't over : Lim discovered that if he was going to be a real player , he 'd have to give up his hard-won U.S. passport . He and the Korean-born wife he had met while studying at Berkeley  --  Mija Kim Lim , also chief financial officer at MJL  --  left their three grown children behind in the U.S. <p> Hardest of all was attracting talented engineers in a country that worships big firms . Until a few months ago stock options were illegal in Korea . Drawing on his U.S. experience , Lim split MJL into four departments and gave each sales targets and bonus-linked incentives . MJL 's top performer took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sum in an economy with a per capita income of $10,000 . Twenty of Lim 's 75 employees hold engineering graduate degrees . Says Lim : " I tell employees , ' One of my objectives is for you to get rich . ' " <p> To motivate Lim 's employees to move its products , I-Cube , a small supplier of chips used in data routers based in Campbell , Calif. , has taken incentives one step further . Explains Shrikant Sathe , I-Cube 's vice president for international market development : " We give MJL employees stock options to get an unfair share of their available bandwidth attention . " It seems to be working . MJL 's sales for I-Cube should quadruple this year , to $130,000 , about 5% of I-Cube 's worldwide total . <p> Lim is readying new products to help Korean firms cut costs and improve efficiency . MJL will soon launch a Korean version of Scopus Technologies ' telephone customer care center software , which lets firms respond more rapidly to caller inquiries , almost a foreign concept in a land used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as $2 million in new sales next year and at least double that in 1999 . <p> Korea is also slow in making large corporate databases accessible to workers . Two of Lim 's partners , Prism Solutions and Business Objects , are hot players in the data warehousing business . <p> Ultimately , Lim would like to go beyond customizing others ' software and put his own Korean-made products on the world market . " I saw many San Francisco Bay Area startups become vastly successful , " says Lim . " It 's important to prove the same can be done in Korea .

Korean firms have been cranking out internationally competitive semiconductors , flat-panel displays and other mass-produced electronic goods for years . But they are only now learning to use information technology as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the National Computerization Agency , Koreans buy and use only about one-seventh as much computer and communications technology per capita as Americans , and one-third as much as Japanese . In short , there 's immense potential for U.S. technology firms that know how to sell in foreign markets . <p> Je Keun Park is founder of High-Professional Consulting , a technology practice in Seoul . He tells of how one of Korea 's largest manufacturers recently heard Westerners raving about enterprise resource planning software that enabled them to integrate operations like sales , finance and manufacturing and to run complex what-if scenarios . The Korean firm spent millions of dollars installing software from SAP and others , and on the hardware to run it all . What it did n't do was make operational changes to feed in the required data . <p> " They decided on the package before setting up any business processes , so in the end they could n't even calculate how exchange rate changes would affect them , " groans Park . Despite the pitfalls , he expects Korean firms to invest more in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of LG-EDS , a technology consultancy jointly owned by Electronic Data Systems and members of Korea 's LG group , says financial pressures and deregulation are forcing Korean firms to smarten up . LG Credit Card , for example , is considering a plan to cut bad debt by using software to create detailed customer profiles . LG-EDS would then like to split the savings between customer and consultant , as they often do in the West . <p> " We 're helping LG Credit Card analyze behavioral differences among groups of customers and how to respond , " says Thorson . " They never would have done this in the past . " <p> With deregulation setting off a flurry of competition , Korea 's telecom carriers are getting the cost-cutting religion . Dacom Corp. , a wireless carrier , plans to install call-center software from San Francisco 's Genesys Telecommunications Laboratories , which can cut query response time from several minutes to a few seconds . <p> In the near term , it 's reasonable in Korea 's floundering economy to expect cutbacks in orders for capital goods like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neil Weinberg <p>
