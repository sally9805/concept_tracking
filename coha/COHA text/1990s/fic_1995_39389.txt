I had n't been avoiding Frankfurt . Far from it . I 've wanted to come back , and , a couple of times , came close . A few years ago , I drove by it on the autobahn , nearly crashing with astonishment at the skyline which had n't existed when I 'd lived there with lean and Billy in 1951-52 . This time , though , I had a reason to come , at least bits of different reasons . <p> My life is n't orderly . Half of the year , I 'm away from New York . A freelancer makes his lance , then finds things to stick it in . I never had trouble finding them , which led me to discipline myself by accepting almost everything offered . How else become other than what you were ? <p> The life was hard on Jean and on her successor , Rowena . Sarah , to whom I 've been married since 1980 , is in tune with it . Before her own work  --  ceramics  --  made her well-known , she used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat . As for Jean , after our two German years , she spent a lot of time alone with Billy and discovered that I was superfluous . Rowena ? She enjoyed being in different places but could n't travel to them : airsickness . We lasted ten months . <p> O.K. , Frankfurt . <p> I was in L.A. doing a piece on movie interest in the artistic and intellectual figures of the century . Hemingway , Fitzgerald , Picasso and Gertrude Stein were as familiar as the Eiffel Tower , but after Beatty made Reds , the Hollywood net dragged up odder fish . Lancaster wanted to make a film about old Pound ; Streisand optioned a book about Jackson Pollock . Eliot 's widow had closed him off , but Lawrence , Joyce , Rilke , Valery and God knows who else were floating properties . <p> At the Beverly Wilshire , I had a call from Lyon Benjamin , assistant to Floyd Harmel . <p> I do lots of work by phone and deduce more than I probably should from voices . Benjamin 's is a staccato @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more painfully joined to their predecessors and successors . The voice itself was n't reedy or breathy , just exceptionally tense . " I 'm interested , " it said . " In a man  --  who may be a cousin of mine . Dead in 1940-sixteen years before I  --  came on the scene . Suicide  --  French-Spanish border  --  trying to escape  --  the Vichy miliciens . Heart trouble  --  carried a manuscript  --  over the Pyrenees .

I 've received assignments from types who use so few words you 're suspended in their silence , and from others who need ten calls to let you know what they 're after . Usually they do n't know themselves till they pick up your response to their fumbling . Lyon Benjamin knew . " That day  --  the Spanish required a French  --  exit visa .

" <p> " Yes ? " <p> " The great literary critic . " <p> " I do n't work much in that area . " <p> I heard the intake and expulsion of breath ; the living Benjamin was disappointed , or pretended to be . I do n't embarrass , I do n't get humiliated , I do n't mind being seen as a naif . Benjamin sensed the score . ( He did a lot of telephonic work himself . ) He started , as if from scratch , even spoke with ease , legato . " I think there 's a film in his life . ' The last intellectual . ' Hyperbole . Still , the man was at the center of European thought . Lived by it , died for it . And no anchorite . Lots of women .

Not much , but good . " <p> In my four-decade writing life , I 've done three scenarios and six or seven treatments which got nowhere . Not my line . Which may be why I find it easy work . I tend to see lives at their crests , in crisis . The small knack is seeing the gestures , hearing the words that define them . The two films which got made made no waves . I appreciated Benjamin appreciating them . <p> None of my work gets much appreciation . I publish articles , not books . Now and then , one causes a stir . There is next-to-no fan or hate mail . I do n't hear about my skill except from editors , and little from them . New assignments are my reviews . I like it this way . Skill hides itself , and the " skiller . " Invisibility makes my work easier . The better-known the writer , the more he becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in itself , a nerve-wrackingly contingent one . The more time you spend on the career , the shorter it is . <p> " The End of His Rope 's a class film . And a fair money-maker . " <p> " I did n't have a piece of it . " <p> " You 'd have a piece  --  of this . " <p> " This ' being a film about your cousin . " <p> " Exactly . Mr. Harmel has  --  a certain amount  --  of seed money . We cast it out  --  selectively-very  --  if you can cast selectively . One seed in fifty  --  takes . When it does  --  you have a  --  Harmel film . An event . A cultural event . A popular event . " <p> I 'm not a film fan . Films run through me . I might be able to name ten staying films , not more . The Godfather . Citizen Kane . Ambersons . City Lights . La Strada . My Darling Clementine . A Bergman or two . Do even these stack up with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think so . They 're too diverting , tantalizing , erectile . Bodies , islands , Astaire , Ginger . One temptation after another , till you 're dazzled . Still , in this world of illusory charm , Floyd Harmel charms deeply . He makes pictures you remember a week after you saw them . <p> I had two assignments after the Hollywood piece . After that , I read at , in and around Walter Benjamin . His writing was full of the highfalutin distinctions and tortuous formulations which , decades ago , turned me off academic life , but it was also perspicuous , sensuous , pleasantly perverse and surprising ; he was a writer . More , he 'd lived more or less as I have , on his wits ( at least after his father stopped supporting him , his wife and son ) . <p> Other coincidences . There were basically three women in his life , though he 'd only married one of them . Like me also , he 'd had only one child , a son , whom he saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alike , burly , heavy in the belly , thin-nosed , brown-eyed , black-haired . His hair was thicker than mine and rode more fiercely from the scalp . He also had a thick black mustache and thick eyeglasses . Unlike Lyon Benjamin , who turned out to be an inturned wisp of a man , pigeon-toed , knock-kneed , cross-eyed , baldly young , we could have passed for cousins . <p> I decided the film would center about Benjamin 's love affair with a remarkable , beautiful , promiscuous  --  does this word still make sense ?  --  young woman , Asja Lacis , whom he met on Capri in 1924 . Asja , a Latvian Bolshevik , was an actress , director and pioneer in children 's theater . I wrote Cousin Lyon an outline , then a treatment , got my twelve thousand dollars and a go-ahead to do a scenario . <p> In March ' 94 , I had an assignment for a piece on the Italian elections . I went to Rome , then spent a day looking over Capri . To Rome , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Benjamin 's post-doctoral dissertation  --  Habilitationsschrift  --  had been rejected in 1924 by the Goethe University there , and it was in Frankfurt that he 'd decided  --  as , twenty-eight years later , I would  --  to live as a literary free-lancer . He wrote for the Frankfurter Zeitung and other newspapers , for magazines , for the radio ; he even did graphological analyses . In any case , under a Benjamin tax-cover , I stopped in Frankfurt . <p> I had other Frankfurters on my plate , a couple I 'd met at a European political conference in Bellagio . There was a tennis court there set in a grove of aspen and cypress ; Jochen , a law professor , and I played tennis every day for the five days of the conference . His companion , Cristina  --  for whom he 'd left his American wife  --  twice fished my copy out of the  --  to me  --  alien WordPerfect waters . <p> En route to Rome , in the two-hour Frankfurt stopover , I left a message on their answering machine saying I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get me a hotel room , close to their place if possible . <p> Two small airport incidents . I inserted a Visa card in the wrong money machine . It flashed " Invalid . " I thought it was its fault not mine , and tried again . Behind me , a briskly unpleasant baritone said , " You will lose your card . " Wrong . It came back . <p> Minutes later , by a row of telephones , I asked another German business type if he 'd be so kind to exchange enough pfennigs for a dollar so I could make a local call . Courteously , he waved off my dollar and slipped his phone card into my phone slot . I left Jochen and Cristina the message . <p> From September 1950 to March of ' 51 , I worked in Heidelberg . My main job was teaching two courses in American literature at the university , but , as an assistant , I received only auditor 's fees ( Ohrgeld ) , which amounted to less than three hundred marks a semester . Nights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the U.S. Army . This paid enough to support Jean and me in a room overlooking the Neckar River . When Billy was born , we needed more space and money . I got a job in Frankfurt as a GS-7 teaching illiterate American soldiers ( those who had n't reached sixth grade and had thus been illicitly recruited ) . In March , I took the train up to find an apartment there . <p> Stepping out of the beautiful iron-and-glass station , I saw a fifteen-foot cardboard cut-out of Charlie Chaplin , mustache , derby , battered shoes , cane , an advertisement for City Lights , a film I 'd been trying to see for years . After I did my business at army offices  --  getting the apartment , picking up and depositing dish-and-houseware and interviewing <p> maid  --  a GS-7 lived well in Occupied Germany  --  I went to the film . <p> I remember feeling set apart from the audience . We 'd lived a year in Heidelberg , but we were n't used to being part of a German audience ; we saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were different : there was n't the same passive gawking in the dark . <p> Near the end of City Lights , the tramp gets out of jail . Back walking city streets , he 's mocked by a couple of urchins . He takes of after them , missing a kick or two . The audience  --  including this member of it  --  laughed . Through the window of a flower shop , the tramp sees the former blind girl for whose successful eye operation he 'd gotten the money which sent him to jail . He stares at her lovingly . Noticing the odd little tramp , she comes out and gives him a flower . He keeps looking at her . As she touches his hand , she realizes that her savior was not the princely millionaire she 'd imagined , but this tramp . Her shock and recognition are beautiful , and Charlie 's answering expression , a fusion of love , pride and comprehension , is the close-up to end all close-ups , the expression on which I 'd like to close my eyes in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in another . <p> When the lights went up in the theater , I stayed in my seat , overcome . The German audience , in overcoats , hats and scarves , rushed up the aisles , faces frozen , even angry . Something had happened to them in the film 's final sequence . Till then , they 'd laughed as I had . Why were n't they moved by the beautiful conclusion ? Was it un-Germanic ? Frankfurt was still squatting in wartime rubble . Around the half-skeletal Cathedral ( the Dom ) were ex-blocks of stony nothing . Were the feelings of its citizens also in the rubble ? Had they been decimated by bombs and a dozen years of manhandling by another little mustached man ? <p> Nostalgia makes everyone a poet . I was in Frankfurt for poetry . There are 86,400 seconds in a day . Perhaps fewer than two thousand of my daily seconds have been turned into assigned words , though in most of my conscious seconds , there is a pressure in me , so familiar it 's as natural as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , I wanted to see where I 'd been , wanted to feel what I believed I 'd feel , but part of this want was the awareness of literary gold in the feeling . <p> In 1952 , I was n't a writer . I was vaguely preparing to be a professor . The teaching job I had was tedious , seven hours a day teaching soldiers to read , add and subtract , but the money  --  $2,800 a year , free rent and maid , plus 300 percent profit on four weekly cartons of American cigarettes ( which the German mailman picked up and paid for once a week )  --  was princely . In two years , I saved $3,000 dollars , enough to support Jean and Billy if I went on for a doctorate . <p> If the job was tedious , life was n't . I came home to wife and baby in an apartment heavy with mahogany tables and sideboards and to Frau Gortat , who cooked and served our sauerbraten and chops . At twenty-three , I felt like a manly provider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once a week , I traded Italian for English lessons with a Neapolitan barber from the Frankfurt Military Post , and twice a month I studied the Aeneid and Ovid 's Metamolphoses with a graduate student from the university . Somewhere in there , I wrote my first article , a survey of German cultural and political affairs , modeled on Genet 's New Yorker pieces on France . The New Yorker refused my piece , but on one of the great days of my life , the Partisan Review wrote that they 'd accepted it . I was going to be in a magazine that published Sartre , Eliot , Orwell , Silone , Camus , Auden . The company was intoxicating , though I stayed sober enough to know I did n't belong in it . I thought I might be a little closer to Gent . If I had a gift , it was for a kind of verbal photography . I could report what was going on . I was n't much of an interpreter or theorist . The interpretations in my Partisan article were quoted from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd felt a door open . I was a journalist , a commentator . Even before the article was accepted , I sensed it was the way for me to go . I did not want to stand in front of students , dropping stale bits of information into their mouths or wiping up the misinformation they spat back . <p> Back then , our German friends worked for the U.S. Army and HICOG ( the High Commissioner of Germany ) in the I. G. Farben Building . They 'd been schooled , and a few had killed , as Nazis , but , as far as Jean and I could tell , they thought and felt as we did . They were starting over ; we were starting out , and were in spiritual step . <p> Now and then , we brought them cigarettes from the PX or American gasoline coupons for trips up the Rhine and to the Taunus Hills . This was not the source of their affection for us . If it had been , even such naive enthusiasts as we would have spotted curds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we were Jews ; we should be able to sense racial antagonism . <p> Our parents , back in America , were less trusting . Jean 's father went on about the fights he 'd fought with " krauts and micks who called me ' sheeny . ' " He wrote us , <p> Anti-semitism is the dandelion in the German lawn . Pluck it out , wake up the next morning , it 's there again . Hating Jews is their avocation . They take it up when there 's nothing else to do . Keep your eyes open . <p> " He 's from another time , " said lean . " He does n't understand what 's going on . " The most we conceded was that for our German friends our Jewishness was a sort of charm they could touch to cure their old racial scrofula . " Take Goetz , " said Jean . " Who could be more decent , tolerant and gentle ? " <p> Goetz had been an aide to Admiral Raeder . He 'd spent six months in an English prison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hoelderlin and " was turned inside out . " He had one of these top-heavy philosopher heads you sometimes see in German university towns , forehead for much of the face , with a strip of hair like an afterthought . His eyes , very light blue , sat deep in sockets . He went over a Hoelderlin poem with me line by line . " Written , " he said , " in 1804 , as madness was sinking in him . " <p> Why did you spread night over my eyes so that I could n't see the earth ? <p> Thinking of Goetz and Germany rather than Hoelderlin , I was moved . ( Though my insides stayed where they were . ) <p> One winter evening , walking home to Neuhau-beta-trasse from the Farben building , I realized that I felt at home in Frankfurt . My feelings had leapt over the rubble of hatred to the days when my German great-grandparents lived here . They had passed down a Germanic credo to my parents : cleanliness , neatness , punctuality , obedience , hard work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these virtues , and I 'd mocked them , but they were in me , they governed my habits , my values , the way I dressed , the way I lived . I thought they might be the reason I 'd discovered my vocation in Germany . <p> Jochen and Cristina gave me a map and pointed out the route between their apartment and the Farben Building . I went up Bockenheimer Landstrasse to Opera Platz . The morning was cold , sunny , full of crystal flash off the stone , steel , glass and concrete . Frankfurt was a hard , proud city . It had elected the Holy Roman emperors ; it had been , until after the Franco-Prussian War , a free city . Now it dominated with money . The new towers were banks . Yet the city was gemuetlich as well as proud , a cozily horizontal city whose skyscrapers looked embarrassed , out-of-place . The low , solid , gray-and-chocolate stone snubbed the gauche metal gleam of the presumptuous banks . This was Goethe 's city , poetic in its burgher heart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here to understand that ? The feeling I had for it was a form of love , one I wanted and was pushing myself to get . You were supposed to feel this way . Nostalgia was an emotional pension earned by living long enough to return . <p> I crossed Eschersheimer Landstrasse , and there was Neuhau-beta-trasse . Fantastic joy filled me . I floated down its hundred yards of umber six flats with tiny lawns . Here and there were basements newly whitewashed , roofs and chimneys newly tuck-pointed , but otherwise it was unchanged . Number 7 . Our house . I could see the back garden where Frau Gortat had married Herr Willy . ( Jean and I were their witnesses . ) Here was the bay window by whose light I 'd read Clarissa and Ovid , Les Liaisons dangereuses and Heine . Here my parents had come to visit us . I saw them , at least saw the photograph we 'd taken of them in the garden holding Billy . Mother was a dozen years younger than I was now ; her curls were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They 'd been dead twenty , and Billy was an angry forty-year-old who hardly spoke to me , and , when he did , told me how wrong I was about everything I wrote , said , was . " I love you , " went his last postcard , " but I ca n't have anything to do with you . You 're out of touch . " <p> I walked back to Eschersheimer Landstrasse . The English bookstore where I bought Everyman and Penguin novels was gone-a pang  --  but much else was n't . The medieval watchtower , fat and confident as <p> sausage , had been repainted and stood where it had stood for five hundred years . The Hauptwache , which Goethe thought Frankfurt 's most beautiful house , was as it had been . One day , forty-three years ago , classes at the army school were suspended so that Americans could redeem their old scrip for new . Germans stuck with old scrip were out of luck . American soldiers came down to the Hauptwache to trade scrip for German marks at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hoover , an enormous black man with a mouth full of gold teeth and a constitutional resistance to the printed word , was dealing marks and scrip with a banker 's aplomb . The week before I 'd said to him , " Private Hoover , I 'm afraid you 're not going to make it to second grade . " The teeth gleamed . " Thass all right , Mister Goldman , do n't you worry none bout't . Sno blame on you . " After Money Change Day , they gleamed again . " Made me four hunnert thirty-one dollar , Mister Goldman . " <p> I walked through a crescent of beautiful half-timbered houses to the Dom . In 1952 , the houses were sheared in half , the rooms agape like screaming mouths . Porcelain toilet bowls shone in the rubble . One-legged and one-armed men were everywhere , as were midgets and hunchbacks . By the station was a poster for Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs : Schneewitschen und die Siebener Zwerge . Jean and I decided to see it , but instead , spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how we found the room  --  Graf Posadowski , a soft-voiced , soft-faced aristocrat who took in our thirty marks and what we were and offered us schnapps in his book-lined study . He sat in the dark in an embroidered armchair . His English was oddly elegant , the phrases treasured and surrendered with regal grace . " I am required to fill out a questionnaire , <p> Fragebogen . Since I am , unfortunately , of noble birth , I am required to put down the names of all the people I know who are equally unfortunate . I have been writing names of dead people for four days . " He told us of one such noble cousin . " His plan was to assassinate Hitler . He made an appointment to demonstrate a new piece of equipment for him . He strapped an explosive device under his tunic . He planned to embrace the Fuehrer , pull a cord and explode . Hitler broke the appointment . Axel made another . That too was broken . Then Axel was sent to the Russian Front . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " May I request a favor ? " <p> " Of course , " said Jean . <p> " Our German cigarettes are frightfully expensive and the tobacco is suspect . Could you buy for me from your PX a few boxes of Chesterfields ? " <p> Said Jean , " Of course , your Excellency . We 'll find a soldier and give him some dollars . " <p> " No ' Excellency , ' please , " said the count gently . " Only the cigarettes . " <p> I crossed the Main on an iron bridge and walked up Museum Row to the German Film Museum . For Benjamin , film was the exemplary art of the age of mechanical reproduction . A collaboration of humans and machines , its making differed from that of the older , religion-based art . The film artist performed for no audience but the camera , so there was no " aura , " no felt look exchanged  --  yes , exchanged  --  between painter and viewer , painting and viewer . Yes , the painting looked too , as in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viewer realizes , " There is no place that does n't see you . You 've got to change your life . " <p> That was going a bit far for me , but I was looking for a Frankfurt aura . <p> Oddly enough , four days earlier , in Rome , I 'd had an aura-like experience with a work of art . I 'd taxied over to the Vatican Museum at 8:15 A.M. and was first in line to see the Sistine Chapel . When the guard raised the bar , I 'd hoofed it like a maniac up and down stairways , through the marmoreal labyrinth , finally into the chapel itself . Except for three guards gabbing in front of the white curtain behind which restorers worked on The Last Judgment , I had the place to myself . I walked from one side to the other , then up and down , taking in the ceiling frescos , the creation of Adam , of Eve , their expulsion , the flood , then the surrounding prophets and sibyls reading  --  it seemed to me  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pouring into my head , felt Michelangelo 's intellect touching mine . I knew the ceiling was about making something out : of nothing , about illusion , volume , space , story , destiny , about the human imitation and betrayal of creation . <p> When the tour crowds came in , I took off . I bought a couple of books on Michelangelo , walked past the crowds swelling each other , then along the high brick wall to the Bernini Colonnade , down Conciliation Walk , around Castel Sant'Angelo and across the Tiber . When I got to the Campo dei Fiori , I drank a cappuccino in front of the hooded bronze head of Giordano Bruno and read the books . They did n't put words to what I 'd seen and thought , but they knew when Michelangelo had painted what , when he 'd fired an assistant , how he lived  --  miserably  --  what he wrote to his spoiled brothers and father back in Florence . One book included a sonnet he 'd written about painting the chapel . With my pocket dictionary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something like I 've grown a goiter in this den . . . which drives my belly to my chin , my beard to heaven , my nape upon my spine . . . .

And I 'm no painter . <p> I worked up a lot of fellow feeling for the amazing fellow . Young , early thirties , he thought himself old , ruined , dying .

( The museum was crammed with apparatus and diagrams about human attempts to preserve what it saw . ) <p> At one , I sat with Jochen in the Cafe of the Literatur Haus on Bockenheimer Landstrasse , waiting for Cornelia Snapper , a friend of his who was writing her Habilitationsschrift on Walter Benjamin , and who worked mornings as an archivist for the Deutsche Bank . <p> The Cafe consists of a few black tables casually served by two waiters . I was the oldest person there , though there were a couple of gray or graying beards and heads , one of which was Jochen 's .

If she lets Peggy watch Beverly Hills 90210 , naturally things like this will happen . " <p> " Is a date so serious ? " <p> " Yes . She should have space for herself now .

Extremely pretty , she had short straight blond hair , blue eyes and seemed to be smiling from every pore . I got up , " Cornelia ? " <p> " How did you know ?

" <p> She filled mugs and sat within two feet of me , tea steam touching her face whose every pore glistened with receptivity , amusability ; the friendliest beauty . " I do n't think of him as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe why it takes me so long to write . " <p> " I 'm the opposite . Ideas fly right past me . I do n't know what Benjamin 's talking about , or what others mean when they analyze him Adorno says he was ' in flight from the trance-like captivity of bourgeois immanence . ' What can that mean ? " <p> " Very German . Anything to do with innerness , makes us think we 're getting the truth of things . If it 's innig , it ca n't be bad . " <p> " For us , ' inner ' means someone 's putting something over on someone . Inner circle . Or it 's dangerous . Inner city . " <p> The pores and blue eyes lit up . " Bei uns , ' inner city ' means historic , old , the Altstadt , the true center . Want to see ? " <p> We went up to the roof . It was windy , cold , dazzling . Cornelia brushed hair from her eyes as she pointed to the Dom , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us like a huge orange gun turret . " The city 's fighting itself , " I said . " The present and past do n't fit . " <p> " This is all I 've known . I do n't see what you see . Though maybe I do . Want to see where I get my name ? Look , there , beyond that small domed church , to the right of the Dom . " She hoisted my arm and pointed it ; delicious support . " A little more to the right . Goethe 's house . " <p> " On Cornelia Street ? " <p> " Nein , Hirschgraben . Not even my parents would name me Hirschgraben Snapper . Cornelia was his sister . " She dropped our arms , brushed hair from her face . Where do the mistresses of beauty learn their enchanting gestures ? " It 's so windy . I show you her picture downstairs . " <p> There she handed me a postcard of a long-faced , long-nosed woman , hair pulled back over a powerful forehead , eyes closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seems awfully melancholy . " <p> " Postpartum depression . She died at twenty-seven . Two years younger than I. " <p> " And your parents named you after this poor sad person ? " <p> " The great genius 's sister ; his only real companion . " <p> " The secret sister . " <p> " Yes . The new archetype , the abandoned sister . " <p> Tea and sympathy , as the famous play of the fifties had it . It was about age-and-youth , a headmaster 's wife , a lonely student . I ca n't remember if she loved him . I too was on a double track , ageless inside except for the knowledge that I was n't . Bolder seniors than I would have led Cornelia to the open quilt , but fixed in my burly self , I stayed where I was . No risk , no gain , yes , but no loss either . And I had something to lose , the amiable feeling this kind beauty had for me . Who knows , if I held up , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were getting rarer , harder . Still , to be pushed off , even as gently as Cornelia would have done it , would be unbearable . Need I could bear . <p> I told her my life , my wives , my interviews , travels , famous and odd friends . A Desdemonish glint lit her face , but I was no Othello . I interviewed Othellos . Still the hour was passing strange . <p> Capri , Summer , 1924 . <p> A small grocery store , wooden bins of fruit and vegetables , shelves of old-fashioned cartons , cans and jars . Male storekeeper in apron , mustache . Making purchases is WALTER BENJAMIN , short , solid , thick black hair , eyeglasses catching and throwing off sunlight from the windows , narrow nose , dressed in suit , necktie . <p> BENJAMIN <p> pointing at tomatoes and holding up three fingers <p> : Tre pomodori , signore . <p> Enter Asja Lacis in white dress , carrying packages . She is Benjamin 's height , dark-gray eyes , dimpled chin , pretty ; her Italian is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I wish  --  je voudrais-ich moechte gern . <p> Shrugs , dropping two packages which Benjamin picks up . To Benjamin : <p> Sank you , sank you . Merci . <p> To storekeeper , as she looks around for what she wants : <p> Mandeln . <p> Storekeeper shrugs . Mindahl . Almonds . Amandes . <p> Waving hands , shaking head , dropping packages . <p> BENJAMIN <p> smiling , picking them up . To her <p> : Entschuldigen sie . <p> To storekeeper : <p> La signora desidera delle mandorle . <p> Storekeeper fetches a bag of almonds , scoops out a long spoonful , looks questioningly at Lacis . She nods happily . He Pours them into a smaller bag and wraps them up . <p> ASJA : Grazie , signore . <p> To Benjamin : <p> Vielen dank ' , Mein Herr . <p> Close-up on Benjamin 's serious but delighted face . Cut to sunlit street . Benjamin is carrying all the packages but the sack of nuts . Now and then he drops one , they both stop to pick it up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asja 's apartment . You can see her twelve-year-old daughter , Daga , reading on a small balcony which overlooks the Bay of Naples . Benjamin is seated at a small table set for three with glasses of red wine , silverware . Asja brings a late of spaghetti to the table and , while they talk , serves it . They drink , eat , talk . <p> BENJAMIN : I 've seen you and your daughter for days now , maybe weeks . You seem to float in your white dresses . Lovely sight . She has such long legs . <p> ASJA : She 's almost thirteen . She 's acted with me twice , once in Brecht . He said she was very good . We go to Moscow in a few weeks to work with Piscator . There are exciting things happening in the theater there . In everything . Why do n't you come ? Palestine is the past , Moscow the future . <p> BENJAMIN <p> close-up , smiling . <p> : I do see some future there . <p> ASJA <p> close-up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daga There 's spaghetti and wine for you . <p> DAGA <p> looking up , craning her head to see them at the table , going back to her book <p> : Save some . I 'll eat later . <p> 10 <p> Waiting for Jochen and Cristina , I read the Literature section of the Eff Ah Zed ( the Frankfurter Algemeine Zeitung ) . A momentary shock : there , in an aquarium , nose to nose with a moronic looking dogfish , was a photograph of Billy . <p> Not Billy , of course , but , said the article , " the bard of the Fallen-Wall epoch of German literature , " one Durs Gruenbein of East Berlin . Not really , when I got down to it , a Billy-clone , but with a similar bell of brown hair and huge-eyed innocence . <p> My recognition system had been shunted onto the strange double track of these Frankfurt hours . So I saw the younger , softer Billy , the one who was still , somehow , mine . <p> Reading German , my spirit eases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set in the solid blocks of prose . Even the clearest German prose worries me , if only because I know that waiting somewhere on the next page is a construction which will ambush me . I 'll have to look up five words I do n't know , and by the fifth , the argument will have been derailed . Line by line , poetry may be harder , but there 's less of it , and that less  --  like a photograph  --  goes a long way , and you feel you 've penetrated essential German-ness . I like reading about German poets . Here was not only the bard of the Fallen-Wall but " his ancestors , Brecht , Celan , Rilke and Trakl , " good German company , the suppliers of neatly packaged profundity . And once you opened the packages , there was often something special just for you , a sort of high-grade astrology . It was better reading about the poet , for you did n't have to bother with the whole poem , only the lines the critic selected and interpreted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mit kalten Spruchen innen tapeziert " ( " Tapestried inside with chilly maxims "  --  appropriate enough ) and three Lines of Celan so clear I thought I was missing something . <p> und zuweilen , wenn nur das Nichts zwischen uns stand , fanden wir ganz zueinander . <p> I did n't have to look up a word and came out with : <p> and sometimes , when only Nothing stood between us , we found ourselves completely beside each other . <p> Completely beside each other . Billy and I. Cornelia and I. Billy was hung up on the old " I , " an " I " I did not want to revisit . That " I ' " s history was streaked with feelings another poet had called " savage , extreme , rude , cruel , not to trust . " With his therapist 's " help , " Billy remembered the noise of paternal tumbles with visiting ladies while Mom was off at Grandma 's and a backyard where he played with a terrifying bulldog while Daddy diddled its mistress within . Gruenbein 's Wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Billy 's . <p> 11 <p> In the Name of the Father turned out to be less a story of brutal injustice in Belfast than the transformed relationship of a father and son imprisoned in the same cell . Most unsettling to this father sitting in the dark beside Cornelia into whose ear I whispered clear English versions of the actors ' rapid Irish-English . <p> Afterwards , we went across the street to a cafe , loud with the pounding music I can not discriminate or bear . The four of us  --  Cristina had gone home to write a paper  --  drank beer and managed a few sentences of post-film critique in the musical intermissions . Time for goodbyes . <p> In the street , I realized I 'd forgotten my cap and went back to the cafe . Our waiter , seeing me , twirled it on his forefinger , an expression on his amused young face which I read as mockery . Was it my age which amused him ? ( What was an old codger doing in such a place , forgetting his hat and who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the German lawn ? <p> Another uneasy undercurrent in this Frankfurt day . On the dark street , I shook hands with Eberhard and then , when Cornelia leaned toward me , I kissed her mouth . <p> A last Frankfurt vignette . Two blocks from our U-Bahn exit , a dark-skinned , uncomely woman , Latin or Indian , approached Jochen and me speaking a language we did n't follow . Finally , we made out the word ayuda . She pointed to a door . It seems she could n't get in with the key she held out to Jochen . It took me seconds longer than it took Jochen to realize that the help she wanted was not about getting into the apartment . " Sorry , " said Jochen . " Tenemos prisa . " <p> 12 <p> Moscow , December , 1926 . <p> SCENE 31 : Asja and Benjamin are in her small apartment . Outside , glimpses of the Kremlin . They 've been arguing . <p> ASJA : If he were n't as stupid as the general , he 'd have thrown you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought you were trying to squeeze the bourgeois out of your veins . We 're not each other 's property . <p> BENJAMIN : You get pleasure from such morons . <p> ASJA : Pleasure 's pleasure . It does n't destroy the pleasure I have with you . Pleasure 's not something you deposit in the bank , draw interest on . <p> BENJAMIN <p> shakes his head , goes to the window , stares <p> : I used to think snow so beautiful . I must have had a warmer coat . <p> SCENE 35 : We follow Benjamin to a baker 's . Medium shot through glass window as he buys cake and carries it out . We follow him through the snowy streets , back to his small hotel . In the lobby , to his amazement , sits Asja . <p> BENJAMIN : Why did n't you go to my room ? The key is there . <p> ASJA <p> looks at him with uneasy affection <p> : No . <p> BENJAMIN <p> opens the box with the cake and shows it to her <p> : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head . They look at each other puled . <p> SCENE 39 : We follow Benjamin out of the lobby of the hotel in his overcoat and fedora . He 's carrying a large suitcase . Asja is waiting in the street . An old taxi pulls up in front . <p> ASJA : Perhaps I 'll come to Berlin in the spring . <p> BENJAMIN : Let me know . <p> They look at each other . She kisses him on both cheeks . He gets in the taxi . As it takes off he looks around and sees her starring at the taxi . It 's dusk , the suitcase is on his knees . He Puts his head down on it and sobs . <p> 13 <p> From : Lyon D.

If you invite me , I will buy a new dress . <p> I wish my work went so well . Perhaps , like Benjamin and you , I was not created to be a professor . I follow him into the labyrinth and can not find the way out . <p> Eberhard suggests we go to Capri in June . Maybe I find the way out in the Blue Grotto . It would be much fun to run into you there . Cornelia <p> 15 <p> " Dear Cornelia . Capri Isle of goats .

For that matter , better luck with your Germany than he had with his . <p> " One golden Cornelia redeems a lot of dandelions . " <p> But why ca n't I remember your face ? <p>
