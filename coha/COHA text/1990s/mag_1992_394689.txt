You may have watched Halley 's Comet hurtle away from the Sun in 1986 and thought you had seen the last of it , at least until 2061 . But twice a year , every year , debris cast from that most famous or comets rains down on Earth . The debris is simply specks of comet dust  --  the same type of dust that spewed from the vaporizing nucleus of Comet Halley , peppering the Soviet and European comet probes and contributing to the characteristic tail of the comet . This cast-of dust spreads along the comet 's path and can remain in orbit about the Sun for thousands of years . When Earth collides with the ancient dust stream , the particles enter Earth 's atmosphere at high speed . Each particle burns up in a brier flash of light  --  a meteor , more popularly ( but mistakenly ) called a " shooting star . " The result of Earth 's semiannual passages through Halley 's dust stream is a pair of annual meteor showers , nights of heightened meteor activity . Each May we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we get the Orionids . At the peak of each shower , you should be able to see 20 to 25 meteors streak across the sky each hour , provided you are watching from a dark rural location . Normally , other meteor showers such as the Perseids of August and Ceminids of December put on the best shows of the year , but this year both these active showers are beset by a nearly Full Moon . Its light will wash out all but the brightest meteors . Out of the half dozen top-rated meteor showers this year , only the two created by Comet Halley enjoy dark Moon-free skies  --  they promise to provide the year 's best meteor shows . FIRST ENCOUNTER : THE ETA AQUARIDS Your first chance this year to observe Halley 's dust burning up in the atmosphere occurs this May . Between April 21 and May 20 , our planet passes through the Halley dust stream for the first time in 1992 . The name of the shower , the Eta Aquarids , comes from the fact that the meteors appear to streak out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Northern Hemisphere observers at this time of year lies low in the southeastern sky during the morning hours . A precise plot of the meteor paths reveals that the source point lies near the star Eta ( eta ) Aquarii . In reality , the meteoroids ( as the dust particles are properly called when they are still out in space ) enter our atmosphere with nearly parallel trajectories . They appear to converge to a point in the sky in much the same way that the parallel lines of a railway track seem to converge to a point on the horizon . Meteor watchers call this point the radiant . The radiant of the Eta Aquarids lies at a right ascension of about 22h20m and a declination of -1 9deg ( Lines of right ascension and declination are marked on most star maps to aid in plotting objects . ) The radiant point is not fixed , however . It can vary slightly from year to year . The radiant also drifts across the sky from night to night , the result of Earth 's moving through the stream . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RA and +0.4deg in Dec . Circumstances for this year 's display of the Eta Aquarids are as good as they get . Maximum activity occurs around May 4 . On that date the Moon is only two days old and will not interfere with observations . A moonless sky is essential for the Eta Aquarids  --  their average magnitude is only about 3 , though the brighter meteors are noted for their persistent trains . Eta Aquarid meteors also move very quickly . With entry velocities of 66 kilometers per second ( 148,500 miles per hour ) they are among the swiftest shower meteors visible , second only to November 's Leonids . For North American observers , the best time to look will be during the early morning hours of May 4 . However , Eta Aquarid activity lasts for several days  --  do n't expect the sharp activity peak displayed by the Quadrantids or Geminids . The broad peak means you 'll see shower meteors on the mornings or May 3 and 5 . No matter which date you pick , you 'll need to plan your meteor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the radiant point in Aquarius does n't rise above the eastern horizon until about 2:30 a.m. local time , making the optimum observing window the period from " radiant-rise " to sunrise . During that time , the radiant point will be in the southeastern sky . The number of meteors you 'll see will depend on your latitude . The southerly declination of the Eta Aquarid radiant makes this an excellent meteor shower for backyard astronomers in the Southern Hemisphere . In fact much of what we know about this shower has come from observers in South Africa and Australia . For observers in the Northern Hemisphere , the farther south you live , the higher the radiant appears above the southeastern horizon , and the more meteors you will see . You should be at least as far south as the latitude of Minneapolis ( 45deg N ) . Anyone farther north than this  --  say in Maine , northern Wisconsin and Minnesota , North Dakota , Montana , northern Idaho , Washington , Canada , and northern Europe  --  will find the radiant low on the eastern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reasonable altitude , morning twilight interferes with observing . Nevertheless , northern observers should still be able to see 10 to 15 meteors an hour . SECOND ENCOUNTER : THE ORIONIDS If you miss the spring display , you need only wait until the autumn r a second chance to observe Halley 's debris . This time the radiant is farther north at a declination of +15deg and right ascension of 0h24m , a spot near Orion 's upraised right arm ( his right , our left ) . We call this shower , not surprisingly , the Orionids . Activity commences on about October 15 and runs to about October 29 with maximum around October 21 . The radiant drifts by 0h5m in RA and +0.13deg in Dec. per night . The physical characteristics are the same as for the Eta Aquarids  --  fast , faint meteors with a broad peak lasting several days . On October 21 this year , the Moon will be 25 days old , just a few days before New . Under clear dark skies , expect to see about 25 meteors per hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orionids promise to be the best shower of the last half or 1992 . DUST IN THE WIND You may be wondering how one comet can produce two meteor showers . The six-month gap between the two provides a clue . The complete answer comes from an understanding of just what a meteoroid stream is . For most of its life , a comet remains far from the Sun and exists as a frozen chunk of ice a few miles across . But when a comet approaches the Sun , the heat gradually warms the comet 's surface . But the frozen nucleus begins to erupt with activity . The ices begin to vaporize and form a cloud of gas around the solid nucleus . When this happens , the comet appears from Earth as a fuzzy " star . " If it gets warm enough , the comet may develop a long tail flowing from the nucleus in a direction away from the Sun . This vigorous release of gas takes with it trapped dust particles that begin to orbit the Sun independently of the nucleus . This is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As the millennia pass , the cometary dust spreads around the entire orbit of the comet and also spreads outward , away from the dense core . This diffusion is caused principally by two forces . The first is gravity . All objects in the solar system are subjected to gravitational forces . Meteoroid streams lying in the general plane of the solar system are exposed to far stronger , more complex gravitational forces than streams lying in high inclination orbits . Consequently , they have relatively short life spans . Comet Halley , however , does n't travel in the same plane as the planets . Its orbit intersects the plane of the solar system at a high angle , coming in from below , cutting above the solar system plane near the Sun , and then heading back south below the orbits of the planets . Its debris is less subject to gravitational disturbances . The second force acting on comet dust is called the Poynting-Robertson effect . The effect occurs because each dust particle absorbs solar radiation on its sunlit side . It then re-radiates this energy from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The uneven absorption and re-radiation of energy gives the particle a kick outward . But the particle moves too slowly for its new orbit and it begins to spiral toward the Sun . ( In reality , the Poynting-Robertson effect acts on all objects in the solar system . However , for moon-and planet-sized worlds , the effect is negligible . But for meteoroids less than one millimeter across , it 's a significant force . ) The combination of these two forces disperses fragile meteoroid streams . The meteoroids spread across the inner solar system to become part of the diffuse cloud that produces the zodiacal light , a soft glow often seen above the horizon after the end or evening twilight or before the onset or morning twilight . For a meteoroid stream to survive it must be replenished at regular intervals . In the case of Comet Haley , that interval is every 76 years . However , the dust we encounter now probably left Comet Halley hundreds of years ago , during its passages by Earth in medieval times . It will be many more generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Halley during its 1986 visit . TWIN PASSAGES The stream of meteoroids laid down by Comet Halley passes within 52 million miles of the Sun ( halfway from Earth to the Sun ) . It reaches out to beyond 1,400 million miles , equivalent to a distance halfway between the orbits of Saturn and Uranus . All of the meteoroids pass through the perihelion point ( the point closest to the Sun ) , where the stream is quite narrow , but spread out into a wide band at aphelion ( the farthest point from the Sun ) . Like Comet Halley itself , the particles travel around the Sun backward ( compared with the direction the planets travel ) and are in orbits angled steeply to the plane of the solar system , or ecliptic . The angled orbit of the meteoroids intersects Earth 's orbit at two points . The first is where the particles cross our orbit headed north from below the ecliptic plane . This intersection point is called the ascending node . Since the particles are traveling from south to north , the meteors collide with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aquarids are best seen from southern locations . Half a year later , Earth is on the other side of its orbit and passes through the stream again , this time at the descending node . The meteoroids are traveling from north to south and the shower appears in the Northern Hemisphere 's sky . With most meteor streams produced by other comets , Earth intersects the stream at only one of the two nodes . But with the Halley meteoroids , Earth passes through both nodes : first in the spring , then in the fall . Though seeing the parent comet is normally a once-in-a-lifetime chance a chance that far most of us has now gone  --  the quirks of orbital geometry give all or us two chances every year to see a legacy of Comet Halley . And this year is one of the best or catching both of Halley 's showers . Philip M. Bagnall is president of the Society of Meteoritophiles and has profiled a number of meteor showers for ASTRONOMY including the Geminids ( December 1990 ) , the Perseids ( August 1988 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @                    @x MOBILE LIBRARIES HAVE BEEN AROUND SINCE 1905 , BRINGING LITERARY SERVICES TO COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE UNITED STATES TWO YEARS AGO , THE MONROVIA PUBLIC LIBRARY , CA , LAUNCHED AN AFTER SCHOOL MOBILE LITERACY AND RECREATION PROGRAM . THE GOAL FOR THE PROGRAM WAS TO PROVIDE A VARIETY OF LITERACY AND RECREATION PROGRAMS TO YOUTH IN THE UNDERSERVED NEIGHBORHOODS OF OUR COMMUNITY . <p> Program activities included tutoring for youth and adults , active and passive games , arts and crafts , as well as story times , and we provided access to health and wellness information by distributing pamphlets and conducting presentations through local nutrition and mental health agencies . To manage the activities , a team of librarians and recreation specialists served as program staff . <p> L : DO NOT ASSUME ... KIDS ARE INDIVIDUALS TOO Working on a mobile van can be a rewarding yet challenging experience . Originally , we thought we would bring our established library programming to the mobile van to engage our young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the library did not necessarily work on the mobile van . We realized that because our young people come from different backgrounds and have differing needs and abilities , we had to prepare to serve them as individuals . We also expected them to voluntarily come and voluntarily join us , but when they did not , we went door to door to invite them . <p> We noticed some kids were enthusiastic and excited to participate in activities and others appeared uninterested or would say things like , " reading is boring " . Others took more time to get used to us than others , and so we learned to consider personality traits and abilities when interacting with each child . In time , the kids began to trust and accept what we shared with them . <p> L : CONNECTING WITH THE KIDS : BE FLEXIBLE In order to successfully connect with our youth , we needed to shift gears and figure out what would engage them . Since one of the most important things when working with young people is communication , we spent more time listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids to keep coming back , so we showed them that we were interested in their ideas . <p> First , as other library professionals had suggested , we redefined reading " so it 's more than an activity with a book . " ( Gorman , 2008 ) British author Geraldine McCaughrean ( 2008 ) said in her acceptance speech for the 2008 Michael L. Printz Award , " I do n't hugely mind if teenagers do n't read books , if books are not their thing . So long as they maintain an inner world of the imagination . " ( 2008 ) Therefore , we included magazines , audio books , graphic novels , comics , non-fiction , and paperbacks in our collection . We created a " design it yourself " program with art , science , and math activities . Our recreation specialists discovered that some of our kids struggled with gross motor skills , so they revisited some old-fashioned , simple games , such as four-square and tag football . Participants were more likely to engage in activities if we remained consistent , so we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STAY TRULY MOBILE Many of our participants do not venture out of their neighborhoods , so we were bringing the activities to them . We invited guest speakers to share on topics such as nutrition , pet care , music , art , nature , and skateboarding . We worked with other community agencies and transported them to community events , included them in our Summer Reading Club , and held a block party for the participants and their families . After discovering that some of our youth were reluctant to take home their artwork , we created " portfolios " for them to store their work , and displayed their art at community events . We also learned that the more the kids engaged in new things , the more they shared about their own self-discovery . <p> L : KEEP THE LIBRARY DOORS OPEN Librarians with successful outreach skills have said that in order to encourage children to come to the library , you must go where they are , honor where they come from , and understand what they love . We invited our participants to the library @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visited . We informed other library staff of our efforts so the children would feel welcomed . It was an extremely rewarding experience for us to see the kids full of excitement visiting our library . It seemed having the mobile library made it easier for the children to decide to visit the brick and mortar building . <p> L : WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT ? Working with multi-age groups of kids requires patience , energy , a sense of humor , and most important , flexibility for the challenges that arise ; we have had our share of challenges . Conducting a mobile outreach program is a physically draining job that requires set-up and tear down of tables , chairs , and street barricades , so we saw our share of scrapes and bruises . Further , we had to create a downsized version of our program and use a smaller vehicle for those days when we had mechanical problems . New construction in the area also forced us to relocate our program to a temporary location . Sadly gang activity threatened the safety of our participants and staff ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their families of their safety , which included knocking on doors , we continued to provide services . <p> Despite the challenges , there has been considerable growth in our program , and not just in the number of participants , which has increased each year . Our participants have experienced better grades in school , increased physical exercise , less behavior problems , and are now willing readers . We tried to create an environment of tolerance so our young people would be willing to try new things , hoping they would feel free to make mistakes , and offer them opportunities to grow . We certainly made our share of mistakes , but the result has been wonderful . <p> L : CONCLUSION Now over to you . How can you profit from our experiences ? We suggest getting a few caring professionals together and start brainstorming . Connect with us and with others like us through the networks available so we can share what works and what does not . Yes , it is trial and error and every neighborhood is different , but it is worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M. ( 2008 ) . An Extreme Makeover . School Library Journal .
