All that Bernie Aronson knew about Yuri Pavlov before they met last June had been gleaned from the transcripts of Pavlov 's meetings with Elliott Abrams , Aronson 's predecessor as State 's top Latin American hand . In keeping with the nature of Soviet-American relations during the Reagan era , the Pavlov-Abrams sessions were contentious and polemical . Aronson feared he would confront a tough hard-liner  --  and Pavlov felt the same way . Instead , each found a kindred spirit . If Pavlov were an American , he would probably be a liberal Democrat . The two diplomats now describe themselves as friends , and Aronson 's is the only American home Pavlov has ever visited . <P> One demonstration of the trust that blossomed from their friendship occurred during a London meeting last August . Panama 's Manuel Noriega wanted diplomatic , relations with Moscow . Pavlov asked Aronson 's advice , which was predictably negative , and the Soviets passed . In the Reagan years , it is unlikely that Moscow would have forgone such an advantageous diplomatic move simply because of U.S. sensibilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ registered on Bush 's calculus of Washington 's stake in Gorbachev 's success . <P> Aronson , 44 , grew up in a middle-class home in Rye , N.Y . After graduating from the University of Chicago , he became a VISTA volunteer in Kentucky . He later worked to overthrow the corrupt administration of United Mine Workers President W.A. ( Tony ) Boyle and then , back in Kentucky , he helped win a landmark coalworkers contract in 1974  --  an effort immortalized in the film Harlan County , U.S.A. <P> A Democrat who wrote speeches for Walter Mondale and Jimmy Carter , Aronson was also author of Ronald Reagan 's 1986 address that rescued a $100 million aid appropriation for the contras by calling for a purge of their Somocista leadership . " Bernie was pushing for a bipartisan Central America policy long before it became fashionable , " says Secretary of State James Baker . <P> Pavlov , 58 , spent his childhood in Velikiye-Luki , a town of 100,000 people 250 miles west of Moscow . In 1938 his father , a Communist Party functionary , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imprisoned by Stalin 's secret police , and his library at home was sealed . " I walked by that room every day , " says Pavlov . " I will never forget . " As soon as he could read , Pavlov pored through a tome on Stalin 's 1930s trials . " From my father 's experience , I knew that many had been unjustly treated , " says Pavlov , who dates his distrust for dictatorships from that awakening . <P> Pavlov remembers his early schooling as little more than a continual drill in Marxism-Leninism . " I recall one of my friends being asked to analyze a political point , " he says . " Our teacher said that two of his three observations were correct because they accorded with Comrade Stalin 's views . But the third deviated from the official line . The only explanation for my friend 's heresy , the teacher said , was that the devil had taken over part of his brain . That 's what school was like . " <P> Pavlov nonetheless made good grades and was admitted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Soviet foreign service in 1954 . " The Gromyko years were drudgery , " says Pavlov . " The ministry was unimaginative and dictatorial . With Shevardnadze , it is a constant intellectual debate . He is a pleasure to work for . "
