South African President F.W. de Klerk replaced his military intelligence chief after an investigative commission charged that officials drafted a plan to hire a convicted murderer last year and have him lure African National Congress members into dealings with drug dealers , prostitutes and homosexuals . The plan for dirty tricks , apparently never carried out , was uncovered by the Goldstone commission on violence , which is looking into abuses by South African security forces . In 1990 De Klerk declared that he was putting an end to all such covert operations .
