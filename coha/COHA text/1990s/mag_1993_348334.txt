Records and its parent company , Time Warner , the entertainment giant defended its artist 's right to free expression . But it began taking a harder look at its albums , rejecting , for example , the work of the rapper Paris . <P> That tougher scrutiny has now sidelined Ice-T himself . Last week Warner Bros. said he had agreed to leave the label because of " creative differences .
