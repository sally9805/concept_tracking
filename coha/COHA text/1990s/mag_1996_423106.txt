In the 1989 El Molino High School yearbook , a small freshman photo is inset next to each senior class portrait , like a makeover story in a fashion magazine . In her " before ' picture , Willow Farey is a frizzy-haired , chubby-cheeked 14-year-old whose bright eyes practically disappear into the deep curves of a wide grin . The camera seems incidental to her happiness . Four years later , Willow 's long , crazy waves have been blow-dried into a sleek sheaf , cheekbones have risen from the baby fat , and the eager , enthusiastic girl she once was hardly seems to inhabit the cool , detached face she presents to the camera . The girl 's messy energy has been made over into the self-protective wariness of a woman who knows what it is to feel watched . Whether they imagine themselves as invisible or constantly on display , few  --  if any  --  girls get out of high school without learning some lesson about the objectification of female human beings . But Willow Farey was one of the many girls who endured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's popular drama teacher , Jonathan Parish . El Molino is a public high school in Forestville , California , an old resort town on the Russian River , about 70 mile north of San Francisco . The school draws students from small communities in the western part of Sonoma County , including Occidental , where Willow grew up . These are the kinds of towns where people hold Main Street parades and whole communities turn out for funerals . They are towns where people tend to know each other 's business and word spreads quickly . A hard place to stand and cry " Foul " But that is what Willow Farey did , over and over again , until Jonathan Parish lost his job . Farey , who is now 24 , says that while she was a student at El Molino , Parish intimidated and humiliated her . He would stare at her breasts , tell her to wear sexy clothes , hug her , and then threaten to ostracize her from her friends if she talked to anyone about his behavior . " I think he forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have , " she says now . Farey was far from the only student to endure Parish 's advances . A student at a Catholic high school where he taught before coming to El Molino later testified that Parish kissed her , took her on dates , and gave her gifts of gold jewelry . What is degrading and demeaning to a grown woman can be devastating to a teenage girl . Willow , who had been an Honor Roll regular , flag corps captain , soprano solist in chorus , and the student voted " Most Helpful " in eighth grade , started cutting school and falling behind in her classes . Just six weeks shy of graduation , she dropped out of school . " Mr. Parish completely turned me off high school , " Farey says . " I was scared of him , scared of what he might do or say , scared to be alone with him . He ruined high school for me . " But ten years after she first met Parish and five years after banding together with other young women , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Last summer , on the basis of testimony provided by Farey and six other students . the state of California revoked Jonathan Parish 's teaching credentials . Despite years of having bureaucrats ignore her , Farey had pushed for more hearings and continued to provide more depositions long after others wanted to give up . " Part of me feels like it 's not worth it to go through such a long process , " admits Farey , " but it 's empowering to know we got him out . " A sad irony of Farey 's experience is that , initially , Parish made her feel good about herself . Farey had few friends when she started high school because she lived so far out of town . She was happy that the first teacher she met took an interest in her . " He asked me if I wanted to do special jobs in class . He was always giving me special attention , which was odd since I was a freshman and there were seniors in that class . But I thought maybe he saw some talent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rueful smile . A slight man in his late thirties , with glasses and thinning hair , Parish was an unlikely Svengali , but he managed to attract an eager coterie of students to the drama department , Willow among them . " He talked to me like an adult , " she says . Some parts of being treated like an adult she enjoyed . But some parts bothered her . Parish would complain about not having enough sex with his wife . He allegedly told one student that he thought of her when he did have sex . At the same time , " he called himself our ' father , ' " says Farey . " He wanted to know all about everyone 's sex life . He pretended to know what was going on in your life as if he could read your mind , when really he 'd heard it through the grapevine . " He also started to comment on Willow 's appearance , encouraging her to look " sexy . " Farey 's mother , Hummingbird ( " Humm " ) Berreyesa , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the day Willow came home from school seemingly depressed , and after much prodding , told her mother a bizarre story . Parish had brought Willow and a male student into his office that afternoon and told them he had an important secret . " He said that he had ' terminal nerve cancer , ' " remembers Farey . " And that he needed us to be ' very close ' to him . He told us that he was going to die before he could quit his job and that we could n't tell anyone . " Humm " had a quiet fit " when she heard the story . " My ears were already open , " she says . " Willow had been saying , ' Mr. Parish is the coolest guy . He 's like one of the kids . ' Well , what sort of teacher acts like one of the kids ? And then this ' nerve cancer . ' There 's no such thing as nerve cancer . " Humm says the final clue that Parish was up to something was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about his " disease " : " Whenever an adult in a position of power tells a child not to tell anyone about something , there 's usually some deceit going on . " Humm decided to call Child Protective Services for advice . " CPS told me there was nothing they could do , that they handle only abuse in the home , " says Berreyesa . What CPS did do was call the school without warning Willow or her family . School administrators told Parish about the call and he guessed immediately that Willow had said something . Farey says that when she next saw Parish " he was flipping out , " but there was no more talk of nerve cancer . Humm was furious : " They put Willow at risk when they called the school . " The next school year , despite Parish 's entreaties , Willow did not take drama . But she was torn . All her friends were in the drama department , and she wanted to be with them . At the same time , she could n't ignore the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She spoke to one and soon after received a note from Parish saying he wanted to see her in the cafeteria . " No one was in the whole building . I walked in and he screamed at me , ' How could you tell anyone that I 'm a child molester ? ' " she remembers . " He threw books at the wall behind me , really hard on either side of my head . He slammed a desk on the floor . He said , ' No one in this drama department is ever going to speak to you again . You are excommunicated . ' " Willow was devastated . " I was having nightmares that he would come and kill me . " Even though she was out of his orbit during her remaining two years at El Molino , she never quite got her bearings again . " Parish helped me learn to hate school , " says Farey , who has since completed her degree and is studying to be a paramedic . In October 1989 , a few months after she should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a drama student still at El Molino . Celeste , who had been the target of crude comments from Parish , had hauled off and hit him after he approached her from behind and wrapped his body around her . When she told her father what had happened , her father 's girlfriend called the principal . The administration was now calling Celeste in and she wanted Willow 's support . That was the moment Willow decided she had been too eager to put the past behind her . " I wanted to help her because no one ever offered to help me , " she says . When other girls heard that Willow and Celeste were speaking to school administrators , they came forward , too . Ultimately , ten told their stories . School officials told them to write letters that would be put in Parish 's file , but when Humm called the school superintendent to ask what would happen to Parish , the superintendent told her he " did n't have to tell her anything . " Realizing that the school would not confront Parish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case pro bono . They never found one . For nearly three years the case languished , during which time everyone but Willow thought it was dead . With Humm 's help , she kept trying to find a legal opening . In 1992 , Willow thought she had it . She and Humm learned of a Supreme Court decision that found that under Title IX , a student could sue a school if the school failed to protect her from peer sexual harassment . Even though Parish was a teacher , not a peer , Willow decided to pursue the case through the Office of Civil Rights ( OCR ) . But first she tried to contact the original students who had spoken up about Parish . In March 1992 , four of them  --  Celeste , Jenny Rivera , Maya Weissmann , and Willow  --  met for dinner and agreed to press the case . But they were disappointed again . Three of them  --  Celeste , Jenny , and Willow  --  had aged out of the statute of limitations ( cases have to be brought before a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incident ) . Only Maya was eligible to bring a case before the OCR . Eventually , both the OCR and the office of the state superintendent of schools agreed to examine the charges . Both investigations concluded that the girls had misinterpreted Parish 's actions . They were all depressed , but Willow , having kept the case alive for three years , would not let it drop again . It would have been easy to give up . It was emotionally draining to keep trotting out painful and embarrassing memories for a series of seemingly uninterested government agencies . On top of that , townspeople were stopping Willow on the street , telling her she was ruining the reputations of both El Molino and Parish . " Everyone thought he was the greatest , the best teacher , and we were trying to take him away from the school . " Parish accused Willow of being a " radical feminist lesbian . " It was tough to stand up to all this , in part because Parish was not the only teacher accused of harassing students ; two others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do nothing about any of the cases . The girls decided that their last recourse was to go after Parish 's teaching credentials , filing a complaint with the state of California credentialing commission . By this time , some of the other young women had left town , while Willow remained in Occidental . She faithfully attended every meeting and every hearing on the case . She said she would n't feel whole until Parish was out of the school . In the late spring of 1994 , the young women were finally called to testify before the state credentialing commission . The commission kept Willow Farey the longest , but was seemingly less concerned with sexual harassment , than with Parish 's habit of handing out passes to Willow so she could cut classes and be with him in the drama department . Nevertheless , in September 1994 , the commission voted to revoke Parish 's license . Under law , he could still teach as long as his case was on appeal . In July 2995 , three days before the young women were to testify at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teacher 's license . Ironically , now that it 's all over , Farey has been getting support . " People are saying , ' We 're really glad you did something , because now we know it 's true . ' " Farey thinks Parish has moved to Oregon ; she would like to see the laws changed so that a person found unfit to teach in one state would automatically be unfit everywhere . She would also like to see the statute of limitations extended for prosecuting harassers . Most girls are too young , she says , to know what to call what has happened to them . She feels shy about the positive side of all the attention she now gets , but admits it is important to talk about what happened . " If I could say something to girls , I 'd tell them to believe in themselves . I think most of us know when something is wrong but we do n't listen to our instincts . " Teresa Moore is a reporter for the San Francisco " Chronicle . " <p>   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @         @x " What on earth is that , Mel ? " Maggie Canady asked , leaning over to stare at the cocktail napkin on which Melanie Regan had been doodling . <p> " What is what ? " Melanie asked . <p> She had n't paid the least attention to what she had been doing , and now she stared down at the napkin . She had flipped it over , so there was no logo to deter the free movement of her pen or mar the pictures she created . <p> Pictures . Real pictures . Recognizable . <p> Detailed . <p> There were four of them , and they were so well situated on the napkin , she might have marked off the corners with a ruler . <p> The top left corner was very evidently a sketch of a fire , so detailed that the flames almost seemed to move . Even more hypnotic was the sketch on the opposite corner . <p> It was of a waterfall , forceful , filling the air with spray as it fell to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violent about it . <p> The bottom right corner showed a fiercely blowing wind , sweeping away the cloud cover . <p> She had n't even known that the wind could actually be drawn . Not without showing something blowing in it . But what she had put on the paper was the wind . And like the fire and the waterfall , it seemed to have life , to be real and almost tangible . <p> The bottom left corner showed an earthquake , and it was amazingly realistic . It was n't a sketch of buildings toppling or a bridge crumbling . It simply showed the ground , but the ground split asunder . Once again , it was almost as if it were happening as she looked at the napkin . Something violent and almost mobile seemed to be captured on the fragile paper . <p> She set the pen down . <p> " I did n't know you could draw like that , " Maggie marveled . <p> Melanie clenched her hands in her lap . " Neither did I , " she admitted . <p> Maggie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third eye in the middle of her forehead . " Wow , " she said . <p> Melanie waved a hand in the air and forced what sounded like an easy laugh . " I do n't think it 's such a big deal . They say that we only use about a tenth of our mental capacity at any time . We were talking , and I guess I was distracted , so part of my subconscious mind kicked in or some such thing . Who knows ? Anyway , I 'm sure I could n't do it again if I tried . " <p> And she meant that . She could n't usually so much as draw a stick figure . <p> She grabbed the beer in front of her and took a long swallow . She realized that she was barely keeping her cool , and that , too , was strange . She had learned long ago how to hide her thoughts and emotions , to play it easy in any given situation . <p> After all , she 'd been around . Los Angeles was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time touring Europe , hung out in New York City for a while and lived for many years in New Orleans , which was really home for her . It was where she had found a sense of herself , and where she had made so many good friends . They called themselves the Alliance  --  and even far apart , they remained close , always ready to help one another out . Maggie was one of those friends , and she could n't believe she felt uneasy in front of Maggie , who knew everything there was to know about her . But she did feel ill at ease , and all because she could suddenly draw . <p> Maggie sat back , arched a brow and took a long sip of her own beer . " I would have thought , if you were magically going to become a great artist , you  --  being you  --  would have drawn Lassie . " <p> " Very funny , " Melanie said . <p> " Well , you are a fabulous dog trainer . " <p> " Because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " So do people , " Maggie said , and set a hand on Melanie 's . " Seriously those are great . Do n't look so worried . " <p> " But it 's so strange that I , of all people , could draw something so good , " Melanie said . <p> " I agree , " Maggie told her , and that was when Melanie realized her friend was as weirded-out as she was by the whole thing . <p> They both had their day jobs , but it sometimes seemed that the Alliance , which operated totally beneath the regular radar of humanity , was the most defining force in their lives , one that made them react to even seemingly innocuous events with immediate suspicion . They dealt with the curious , from the slightly uncommon to the absolutely bizarre , which made sense , most of the members being rather unusual themselves . Their titular head , Lucien DeVeau , lived in New Orleans , where it seemed they most often gathered , since New Orleans seemed to attract the peculiar and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where she was now living , could be most unusual itself . Back home , most of her friends were in relationships  --  married , for the most part . Lucien had a wife he adored , Jade , who of course was part of the Alliance , too . For Melanie , it was like having a big family , but she hated being a third wheel , and it did sometimes feel that way when she was back home . <p> California had become her place . She was used to standing on her own here , at least on a day-to-day basis . <p> Tonight was supposed to have been just a nice evening out . Maggie had a houseful of children and a boutique that was thriving . Melanie 's life was much easier in one sense  --  no children  --  but she was extremely proud to be considered one of the finest trainers in the country now , and she traveled extensively to train show dogs , working dogs and just plain pet dogs . She had an affinity for all animals , not just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special gift for working with them , from hamsters to horses . Training the unruly German shepherds of an A-list movie star had first brought her out here , and she had been determined to carve out a life for herself . <p> So far , it had been a fine life . And now and then she got really lucky and her friends came out to see her . <p> She had found her niche . She had a great job . She loved the animals she worked with , and they loved her . <p> In her own mind , at least , she did n't do half so well with most human beings . She was lucky to have very good friends despite that , though she was n't quite certain she considered all of them to be human beings . Maggie , however , was definitely very human . <p> Maggie 's home had always been New Orleans , but at least four times a year she took a much-needed break and traveled out to L.A. to spend a few days with Melanie . Her husband , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working the French Quarter , and though he was very busy himself , he was also a great father . His day job was very important to the Alliance , but he enjoyed getting quality time to bond with his brood when Maggie headed west . <p> Sometimes a few of Melanie 's other friends joined them when they got together , but tonight it was just the two of them , and Melanie was glad of that . <p> If she had n't already felt completely unnerved by the drawings , her friend 's reaction would have alerted her that something weird was going on . Maggie was taking the drawings very seriously ; Melanie could tell by the way her face had drawn taut and her eyes had darkened . <p> And Maggie always knew these things . <p> Maggie was a beautiful woman , with deep auburn hair and green eyes ; she was down-to-earth and one of the most socially conscious people Melanie had ever met . She adored her own four children and especially loved five-year-olds . They were perfect people then , she had told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves and eat fairly neatly , but too young to have learned hatred or prejudice , and still willing to believe in the word of the adults around them . <p> " What about six-year-olds ? " Melanie had asked her once . <p> " By that age they start questioning everything you say , " Maggie had warned her . <p> Dogs to Melanie were like five-year-olds to Maggie . They offered up unconditional love . Many were incredibly bright . Most wanted to learn . <p> Bad dogs , she believed , were like most bad children : created by those around them . But then , that was a personal opinion . <p> And she was very aware that she was thinking about dogs and children because she was so upset that she had suddenly become an artist . <p> " How curious , " Maggie said suddenly . <p> " Well , yes , we 've established that , " Mel said . <p> Maggie flashed her a smile before growing somber once again . " Think about it . You drew a waterfall . Water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And what seems to be an earthquake . Earth , wind , fire and water . " <p> " Remember Earth , Wind and Fire ? Great group , " Melanie said . <p> Maggie flashed her a concerned frown . <p> " Mel " she began , then paused . <p> " What ? " <p> " What the hell is that ? " Maggie asked suddenly . <p> " What ? " Melanie asked . <p> " Ca n't you feel it ? " Maggie asked . <p> Melanie looked up . They were seated by a gold-fili-greed mirror , and she caught sight of her own reflection . She was surprised to see that she looked so wide-eyed , so lost . She was n't normally uncertain of anything . <p> It was the drawings , she knew . <p> She studied her own reflection : wide blue eyes , hair so blond that her friends teased her about looking angelic . Fair skin . She was tall  --  even sitting she still somehow looked tall  --  and that seemed important suddenly . She carried her five-eleven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fragility because of her china-doll coloring . <p> But at that moment <p> There was something in her reflection . <p> Dread . <p> " Feel it ? " Maggie repeated , and tapped a finger on the corner of the cocktail napkin where Mel had drawn an earthquake . <p> " It 's happening now , " Maggie said . <p> And then Melanie did feel it . <p> The earth was trembling . <p> It had started off subtly . Still , she should have felt it , but she had n't , not until Maggie brought it up . <p> But it was true . It was happening , slowly at first , barely there . <p> And then it increased . <p> Suddenly everyone in the restaurant began to feel it . <p> People started to talk all at once , panic rising in their voices . <p> " What the hell is that ? " a gruff , heavy-set man demanded . <p> " Look , the glasses are all shaking ! " a woman cried . <p> A rumbling sound started to rise over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Dishes suddenly crashed to the floor . <p> " Earthquake ! " someone shouted . " Get under a doorframe . Move ! " <p> Maggie and Melanie just stared at one another . <p> Because it was true . The rumbling had risen to the decibel level of a freight train rushing through the night . The chandeliers were shaking , the tinkling a strange counterpoint to the roar that was continuing to rise . <p> A statue near the doorway fell over with a crash . <p> A young woman let out a terrified scream and jumped to her feet , her chair crashing to the floor . The man with her dove beneath the table . <p> The woman , in a blind panic , went running toward the entrance . <p> " Oh , my God ! " Melanie said , horrified . " I 've got to stop her ! " <p> Maggie caught her arm and tried to stop her . <p> " Get under the table , " Melanie told her , then repeated the warning at the top of her voice as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had run right out into the danger of smashing glass and crashing cars . <p> Outside , it was mayhem . As was so often true with quakes , one side of the street , was a mess . Her side looked almost untouched . In the street itself , cars were crushed and piled everywhere , horns blaring . People were running blindly , shouting in panic . Melanie saw the woman who had raced from the restaurant . She was standing like a deer caught in headlights , right in the middle of the road . Melanie hurried after her just as a Volvo , trying to avoid the crashed car in front of it , nearly plowed into her . <p> Melanie grasped her by the arm and realized that she was in shock . <p> " Get back in the doorway come on ! " <p> She dragged the woman back toward the restaurant , where a busboy , standing in amazement by a support beam , reached for them just as a massive planter started to tumble from the terrace above them . <p> " Help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman into the busboy 's arms , then turning to leave . He caught her arm , dark eyes concerned . <p> " Where are you going ? Things are still falling . There could be aftershocks . Please , get back in here ! " he shouted to Mel . <p> " I 'm all right , " she told him . " I 'm uh , emergency personnel , " she lied . She should have felt bad . He was rising to the fore in the midst of disaster , concerned about others . <p> But she could n't stay . <p> And she could n't explain what was tearing at her . <p> She had drawn the earthquake . And then it had happened . <p> She felt responsible . <p> She told herself that earthquakes were common in California . This was n't an anomaly . <p> But this time <p> She could n't help it . She felt responsible . <p> Alarms were going off everywhere . Glass was shattering , sirens blaring . <p> Outside the restaurant , Santa Monica Boulevard , with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disaster . The earth was still rumbling . And then it stopped . Everyone seemed to freeze for a split second , as if time stood still . Another rumble came  --  along with renewed screaming . A smaller rumble followed a second later , and then everything went silent , unmoving . Melanie had been through a few tremors before , and she knew this was n't the " big one " scientists had been predicting for years , but it had been a strong shake , and it looked as if it had been centered south of them . Looking around , she could see that most lights in the vicinity were gone , but a glow just a few streets over told her that at least part of the city was probably up . She thought about how capricious quakes could be as they spread out from the epicenter , crushing one block and leaving another with crystal curios still standing in their places . <p> Here , glass and masonry and more lay strewn everywhere . <p> Some people were staggering around in a daze , others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came another blast of breaking glass . <p> This time , it was n't the earth taking vengeance . <p> It was a group of hoods . <p> How anyone had recovered quickly enough from an earthquake to start thinking of looting , Melanie did n't know . <br> Continues ...
