Section : OAS <p> On September 25 , 1990 , an extraordinary exhibition on the Portuguese era of discovery was inaugurated at the OAS Museum of Modern Art of Latin America , in Washington , D.C. Present for the occasion were the Prime Minister of Portugal , Professor Anibal Cavaco Silva ; the Secretary General of the Organization of American States , Joao Clemente Baena Soares , and other dignitaries from North and South America . <p> The story of the Portuguese Renaissance , and of voyages to Africa , Brazil , China and India , is told through colorful maps , charts , illustrations and paintings vividly reproduced on panels . This exhibit , organized by the National Commission for the Commemoration of Portuguese Discoveries in Lisbon , is visual evidence of the focus which both the OAS and the Government of Portugal have adopted for the Quincentennial Commemoration : the propagation of knowledge and an increased understanding of diverse cultures . <p> The exhibit was conceived by the renowned Portuguese historian , Luis Felipe Barreto , whose work explores the cultural and geographic factors which propelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15th and 16th centuries . <p> These two centuries witnessed a far-flung expansion of the peoples of Christian Europe , in which Portugal played a fundamental and pioneering role . Portugal was the first modern European nation to extend the frontiers of its political , economic and social power and the only nation of the time to establish definite links with all of the earth 's continents . <p> The Portuguese not only altered geographic boundaries on a global scale , they also breached the traditional horizons of knowledge and initiated the building of a world culture . Their contributions to the fields of natural and applied sciences , nautical astronomy , cartography and naval contruction were essential to the progress of mankind . As Garcia de Orta wrote in 1563 , " the discovery and knowledge of more lands has brought us the discovery of many of the errors of the past . " Portuguese seamanship was characterized by the capacity to adapt , apply and transform traditional knowledge in a creative manner , the very essence of the scientific approach . <p> The Portuguese of the Renaissance were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to religion , politics , botany , zoology , mineralogy , hydrography and geography that later enabled other European nations to expand . The explosion of information supplied by the Portuguese voyagers , stimulated a humanistic discourse about man and the secular nature of his world . <p> While on view in Washington , D.C. the exhibition coincided with a major international art history conference entitled " Spain and Portugal in the Time of the Navigators , " which was also sponsored by the OAS , in collaboration with Georgetown University , George Washington University and the governments of Spain and Portugal . <p> In the coming months , this enlightening exhibition will travel to Brazil , where it will be seen in the cities of Sao Paulo , Florianapolis , Belem do Para and Brasilia . <p> MAP : Left : Map of the Atlantic by Luis Texeira , c. 1600 ; Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale , Florence .
