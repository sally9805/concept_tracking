Sometimes fiction forces us to look at things in a new light . Science fiction in particular can examine ancient beliefs and remake them  --  and not always to our liking . <p> Encyclopedia of Anglican Catholic History , Volume 3 : <p> Elisabeth Altgeld , Anglican missionary , born 2111 , Illinois , Earth , ordained 2137 ( before the Anglican-Roman Compact of 2183 ended female ordination in exchange for limitation of powers of the papacy ; see article Vol. 1 ) . Credited with bringing Christianity to the Magellanic planets ; little is known of her specific activities , except that she spent most of her career on Kputkp , where she died in 2150 , possibly due to the famine of that year . <p> The insectile alien joined the group of Canterbury pilgrims , as the tourists liked to be called , just before the tour reached the Martyrdom . The creature was black , standing upright on two bug legs , with a ring of flexible appendages , more gray than black , around its middle . The head had a maw of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , spongy lumps on the sides of a bullet-shaped head . From its neck hung a wooden crucifix . <p> Father George Morville nodded recognition at the alien , reluctantly , and went on giving the tour , the quaver of age in his voice multiplying in the echo off the marble pilasters . " This stone marks the spot of the Martyrdom of St. Thomas Becket , December 29 , 1170 . All gather ' round , within the range of the stimfield  --  " humans and others , three dozen in all , drew in closer around him , "  --  and we 'll show you it , let you see and feel it , just as it happened , seventeen hundred and twenty-three solar years ago . " He checked his math ; yes , 2893 less 1170 , that was right . Memory was as bad as his eyesight . <p> The space around the group wavered , then reshaped itself . Over George 's shoulder , the 1184 A.D. choir , with its screen of stone statues , was replaced with Anselm 's Norman structure as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty years old . Brown-hooded monks , heads deeply bowed , shuffled into the choir , but still circumnavigating the clot of visitors . One of the tourists reached out to tug at a coarse brown sleeve . She looked disappointed when the image did n't react . <p> George gestured toward the arched stone doorway from the cloister . The tourists turned to watch the silk-coped figure of Archbishop Thomas Becket hurry past them into the transept , darting a glance over his shoulder . Behind them , the murmur of Latin vespers rose like heat toward the vaulted roof . Before Thomas could join the monks , four knights bolted through the door after him , their hard shoes stamping like hooves on the stone floor . The monks ' voices rose a little , as if to overcome the profane sound . With one hand Thomas drew his cope tight around him as the knights gabbed for him . With the other he slapped at one of them , a small , dark man with a sharp arch to his brow . " FitzUrse , " Thomas said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tour , though they understood no more of Thomas 's guttural , Germanic-sounding old English . Moonlight filtered through the clerestory windows . Thomas and the knights spat sounds at each other , voices rising over the monks ' , until FitzUrse drew a sword that sliced the air and came down with a crack upon Thomas 's head . The Archbishop fell to his knees , whispering the name of Saint Alphege . The sword struck again , harder , and again , until the top of his head fell away like a cap , his skull like a chalice pouring blood on the floor . One knight , who had hung back throughout , a wiry man with a face only just showing age , crossed himself as Thomas 's body collapsed . His face was very pale . <p> A sharp keening wail , like a balloon squirting air , rose and echoed in the transept . George spun to see the alien clutch its shiny black carapace and scurry away , its wail receding along the nave . He shut off the stimfield . <p> Bloody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Still , it had been nothing but trouble , and frankly he thought the creature should be excommunicated . So he 'd told the Dean of the Cathedral earlier that morning . Of course the Dean , an ambitious young fellow , not even fifty , seldom had time for George Morville . He probably had n't heard a word . <p> The tourists chattered amongst themselves , their shrill accents clashing and ricocheting off the Bell Harry Tower . It gave George a headache . One of them tugged at the sleeve of George 's well-worn cassock . His eye roved up and down her lithe body , clothed in a fan-pleated bodice and scuffed white leggings . He wondered if she was just as lovely beneath the clothes , just as cool and white and full in the proper places . But she was young , and it was his misfortune to be old . He asked for her question . <p> " The one who stood back , which one was he ? " <p> " Hugh de Morville . No relation to me , I might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they all left King Henry . Did n't have the stomach for it . " <p> " That Kputkp  --  " she pronounced it kip-ut-kip , jerking her head toward the wailing alien 's path of retreat , "  --  did n't have a stomach for it either ! " Most of the humans , and some of the other aliens , laughed . There were no other Kputkp . <p> The alien 's stomach was not something George wanted to be reminded of . He asked if there were other questions . <p> A humanoid alien  --  from Kanth , conquered not too long ago in one war or the other , George thought  --  raised its mittenlike hand . Earth was a museum planet for the history of the human race , but for some reason all these other types wanted to see it too . At least these Kanth were n't so repulsive . " Becket was not a kind man . How is he a saint ? " <p> " The road to salvation is paved with forgiveness ; " George answered . " The Lord welcomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the end . " The Kanthian pursed its thin blue-red lips , but did n't say more . <p> George wound up the tour , pointing the visitors toward the kiosk where Cathedral souvenirs could be purchased . The group dissolved , some responding to his halfhearted sales pitch , the rest setting off to roam the building and grounds . One switched on a retina recorder . George could n't be bothered to tell him it was n't allowed . He went outside . <p> There were smooth stone benches on the green , which visitors seldom paused at , given the short time most had to see all the sights of the planet . George lowered himself carefully to a bench in the sun , the cool stone painful against his arthritic back and legs . Perhaps the pain was penitence for his rudeness to the alien . It called itself an ordained priest of the Anglican-Catholic Church . He really should be more accepting . <p> Called itself . Well , he supposed it really was a priest , by right of apostolic succession . It had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in turn been ordained , and back until one of them was first ordained by a Christian missionary from Earth , who had herself been duly ordained and consecrated . Of course , some would question whether any of it counted , the missionary being a woman , ordained before the reunification , when that sort of thing was done . <p> It had been hard enough bringing the Anglicans and Catholics together . He could n't see how there was a place under this ecclesiastical roof for the bizarre alien sect this so-called priest from Kputkp had told him about a day before . <p> He leaned back on the bench . and tilted his head up to the gray-blue sky . At least it was n't raining today . <p> It had rained the day before , off and on , the rush of it outside swallowing the noise of footsteps and voices in the Cathedral . <p> Perhaps it was strange that the only priest present would be the tour guide . There were plenty of others nearby ; the office annex next door housed the Archbishop and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But an hour after morning prayer , George was the only clergyman in the church itself . He leaned heavily against the visitor information table where the tour groups assembled , waiting to see how many there would be for his 10:15 tour . Money was tight and the current war had cut off a large chunk of the galaxy , so it had been a slow summer . George was n't troubled . In nearly fifty years at Canterbury , he had seen it all come and go and come again . Next year , or perhaps the year after , would be better . War kept tourism down , but at least it kept his niece Marina in a job . <p> There was a school group from Mars for the tour . That helped make up the numbers . Also a few old ladies , with the zigzag haircuts that had gone out of style a generation ago . And the nuns  --  there were always nuns . As the tour was about to begin , the alien scuttled up . George restrained the shudder that nonhumanoids always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a Kputkp , though contact with their planet had been sporadic at best , they being the other side of the disputed territories . He had seen pictures of them somewhere . Rather surprising it made it here , he thought . <p> It stopped fight in front of George and inclined its head toward him . Its jaws clicked as it spoke . " Are you a priest , sir ? " <p> George fingered his collar . " Yes . " <p> " I would like to talk . To you . A priest . " <p> " I have a tour to lead . I 'm sure most of your questions will be answered by the tour . " <p> " Not to talk about this cathedral . " <p> " Well . These people are waiting , and we do n't like to be late . Perhaps someone else can help you . " George turned away . <p> The Kputkp joined the tour for the first part , but wandered off halfway through . George breathed a sigh of relief , though he felt bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put off .. <p> The alien sidled up to him after the tour . " May I talk with you now , Father ? " The clicking of its jaws grated on George 's nerves . He looked around . Even the woman who minded the information table was gone . <p> The alien did n't wait for him to say yes . " I too am a priest . I am from Kputkp . " George looked for a clerical collar , in vain ; the creature did n't wear anything he recognized as clothing . " But being so far away ... the faith has ... lost something in translation . I have come to bring it back . " <p> He waved toward the kiosk against the wall . " There are histories available on retina player over at the  --  " <p> " I would like to talk about what you believe . " <p> George started to walk . It saved him having to look the alien in the eye . The alien followed . " It 's really all in the creed . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish to talk about your faith ? " <p> George paused . It was two questions , really , and he was n't sure he could answer either . He retreated to the earlier question . " I can spare a few minutes to talk about doctrine . " He gestured toward a pew . " Shall we sit ? " <p> " No , thank you . But you sit please . " George realized the alien physique did n't really permit sitting , at least not the way humans did it . But he was tired , so he sat . Rather than crane his neck to look up at the alien , he gazed off into the middle distance . <p> The jaw-clicking of the alien 's speech quickened ; it reminded George of tap-dancing . The rhythm did n't match the cadence of the words , but it complemented the beat of the rain . " Is it true that Jesus Christ was a human being ? " <p> And this thing called itself a priest ? George looked at the crucifix dangling against the alien 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the figure on it was ... almost insectile . <p> " Well of course ! " It came out louder than he intended . Tourists glared . He drew in a breath before going on . " Christ was man and God in one . This is at the very root of our faith . This is how He saves us all . " <p> " But I am not man . Do you believe Christ died for me ? " <p> George thought a moment . " Yes . " That much he was sure of . After a few seconds more , he went on , less certainly . " You are not a man , but you are mortal . That is the point . " <p> " But human survival does not require the Sacrifice . How are you in communion with God ? " <p> " I do n't understand your question . " <p> The alien produced a retina player  --  it must have joints or pockets or something that were n't apparent  --  and offered the scanbox to George . He took it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The creature gave hi m the willies . <p> He raised the scanbox to his eye and pressed the button . The red laser pulsed once , then was replaced by images that printed themselves on his brain . It was an encyclopedia entry on the Kputkp . The Sacrifice : apparently it meant that the Kputkp gave birth to a first offspring , which they ate to nourish themselves for the birth of ensuing offspring who were allowed to live . Cannibals ! And this  --  this thing ! equated that with the Holy Eucharist ! <p> " You eat your own children ... " <p> " So that others might live , " the alien answered . " Without that , what do you eat for communion ? " <p> " Bread , of course . And wine , " <p> " How is that the Sacrifice of the Lord , who gave his only Son that others might live ? " <p> That newly familiar clicking sound interrupted his thoughts . He snapped hi s head up , neck creaking a little , to see the alien standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over its shoulder . <p> " Father , I want to talk again . " George thought he detected sadness , though he wondered if Kputkp even had emotions . Could they , who ate their children ? <p> " I really think you should speak with the Dean . He is in charge here . " <p> " I want to talk to you . " <p> There was little he could say to that . <p> " I came here to learn about Jesus Christ , who lived here in your world . I understand how the Father could let His people kill His Son , because He would eat the flesh , as do we all , to nourish the rest of His children , which are we all . That His Son should be one of you  --  " the alien lowered its bullet-shaped head , rocking it gently back and forth , "  --  was a revelation . " The jaws clicked like an admonishment . <p> " We thought it mere coincidence that Christ lived here . Upon learning His human parentage , I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I come to your place of worship , the place our missionary founder , Mother Altgeld , came from , and see a vicious , brutal murder . A waste , not a sacrifice . " It ended the sentence with a sound like a retch . <p> " The men who killed Becket were punished for their crime . It 's said that they wandered for years before they could find peace and forgiveness . " <p> " They killed a man ! " <p> " Christ offers us all forgiveness . Would you have us eat them for their crime ? " <p> " Never . They are profane . Were n't they Christians ? " <p> " Yes , they were . The fight was all about  --  " <p> " It does not matter  --  they are Christians and yet they are murderers . And you , Christian , can recreate it and look at it without revulsion every single day ! " The alien 's rocking head moved more quickly . After a moment , its entire body began to shudder , and once again it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went . <p> George shook his head . He would let the Dean see to it . He reached into his pocket for the letter he had been carrying that he had been looking forward to all day . He smiled that his niece still carried on the old craft of written language , that he could share that secret language with her , even now that she was grown . He unfolded the page . <p> " Dear Uncle George , " he read . Her lettering was as fine and vertical as the script on the Accord of Winchester floating in preservation liquid inside the Cathedral . He remembered showing it to her and explaining about words on paper , how things were recorded and passed on in the days before you could scan information through your eye straight into your brain . She was a child then , new to Earth , her mother having taken a job maintaining the Amazon . The child , Marina , traced her fingers in the air in the forms of the letters , her bright blue eyes wide . George taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other since , despite the time and cost . They did it because each liked holding something the other had recently touched . <p> " Just a quick note , " the letter read . " I 'm working this week on designs for settlement buildings on the captured planets . I try to make them beautiful and memorable , like your cathedral . I want us to bring these planets something worthwhile . But what we can fabricate on-ship is pretty limited , so mostly they 're just practical . I do my best . <p> " It 's boring as hell out here . I 'm not sure hardcopy transfer is being done with any efficiency this far away , so I do n't know when you 'll get this . Anyway , I 'll write again when I can . Love , Marina . " <p> Marina was fourteen last time she visited him at Canterbury . She was getting tall , she was almost as tall as George . She wore her straight brown hair very short , with bangs that , though neatly trimmed , hung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He guessed that was how all the kids were wearing their hair . She was sturdier than her mother  --  Nan was more the willowy type . They sat across from each other at his well-used dining table . Marina was a bright spot in the mustard-colored room . <p> She fingered the gold cross dangling from a chain around her neck . George had given it to her when she was ten . " Glad to see you still have that , " he said . <p> " I do n't wear it much . " <p> He looked down at the wood and began tracing the grain with his fingertip . " I suppose it 's not the fashion . " <p> " I do n't do things just ' cause everyone else does . I just do n't think this cross thing means much . " <p> His finger stopped tracing . <p> " It does mean something that it came from you . But I do n't go to church any more . " He started to smile at her . " You 're gon na say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think anything without everyone calling it a phase . " She twirled a strand of her bangs , tugging it mouthward . It would n't reach . " I just think there 's a problem with religion when it says it 's for everyone , but it 's more  --  " She stopped to search for the words , then finished triumphantly . " It 's more exclusive than inclusive . " George wondered who she was quoting . <p> " You 're thinking too much , child . " <p> Marina sighed . " So according to your church , I 'm not supposed to think . Great . Thinking is what separates us from the sheep . So , church is for sheep ? " <p> " It has to do with faith , dear . " <p> She shook her head , but she smiled . " I still like the Cathedral , though . I want to be an architect . Can we go walk around ? It 's kind of a busman 's holiday for you , but ... " <p> Busman 's holiday . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alien was back . Last thing he needed . <p> " I have something for you , Father . " One of the limp appendages snaked around another scanbox . George took it . He held it up and pressed the button . <p> He flinched at first . The images were of aliens , Kputkp , their carapaces reflecting a low-hanging orange sun . They gathered around a small altar , on which rested a chalice , a silver paten and a long ruby skewer . The crowd of aliens parted , and one of them carried forward a small one , even more buglike than its elders . The others rocked their heads as it passed . The small one was set gently in the center of the altar just as another adult , the one that stood before George here in Canterbury  --  he was surprised to find he could tell one from another  --  stepped behind the altar , a ragged clerical stole draped over its body . Above it George saw a crucifix : a black metal cross with a figure pinned to it , writhing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He dropped the scanbox . <p> " Continue please , " said the alien . It loomed over him , blocking his way , though he doubted the creature would restrain him . He had to confess a certain morbid curiosity . His stomach churned . He brought the box back up to his eye . <p> The alien priest raised the paten , the chalice , and the ruby blade each in a separate appendage . Then it moved all its appendages , seven he now counted , in unison to trace the shape of a cross . The others did likewise . At last , the blade came down upon the child , the first stroke quick , the others less so , but equally deliberate . George flinched with each one . A steamy rust-colored fluid oozed from the rents . The priest collected it in the chalice . George could smell the sick sweetness of death . The Kputkp dissected the body neatly and arranged the pieces on the paten to form the letters alpha and omega . <p> He closed his eyes long enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened them , he saw the Kputkp line up for communion . The weakest ones were ushered forth first . Some of them had to be helped . Each devoured hunks of flesh from the plate , curled itself momentarily on the ground in what George took to be a genuflection , took a long drink from the chalice , curled itself again , then returned to the crowd . <p> The next to eat looked less frail . George thought they looked sad . The rest followed . There were only crumbs left on the plate when the priest ate . He wrapped his maw around the entire chalice and sucked out the remaining drops of blood . George put down the scanbox . <p> " To each according to his need , " the alien said . " There is more . " Its appendage , smooth as glass , pressed his hand back up . <p> A date flashed at the comer of his eye , telling him this was much earlier . There were the Kputkp again , but this time a woman , a human , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guessed . Her hair was gold , with a faint tinge of red , her pale brown eyes round and expressive , still beautiful despite the lines spraying out from them . <p> Mother Altgeld was surrounded by Kputkp , almost all of them thin and weak . " The famine , " George heard the alien priest say , his voice like an echo . The woman stood in front of a table made of twigs stacked in piles , her voice simulating the sounds of the Kputkp language . <p> Mother Altgeld climbed onto the altar . She stretched herself out as if to sleep . She crossed herself . The name Mother suited her , he decided . He could imagine her among children . <p> One of the aliens came forward with the ruby knife . George gasped . Mother Altgeld opened her palm and accepted it from him . Her chest rose and fell with a deep breath . She closed her eyes and plunged the knife into her own chest . George dropped the box . It clattered on the stone path . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mother Altgeld seven hundred years ago , we 've had no wars , no greed . She gave us the example  --  one must sacrifice for the greater good , even beyond what is normally required . The Sacrifice is not just for one 's own offspring and not just for food Rather than evolutionary necessity , we do it for one another , for the whole We care for our hungry and our needy , so no one 's needs fail to be met . We are truly brothers to one another . This is what Jesus Christ taught , Mother Altgeld said , and so we follow . Is this not what you believe ? " <p> " No wars ? " <p> " None . " <p> " But you did n't have many before , did you ? " <p> " Our population was halved by war just before Mother Altgeld came to us . We were hungry when she came because our crops were decimated by war . Yes , Father , we had wars . Until Mother Altgeld taught us to follow Christ , through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now you see why I was so shocked to learn Jesus Christ was one of you . " <p> " What do your women say about losing their children to your sacrifices ? They ca n't be  --  " <p> " We all reproduce . Since Mother Altgeld 's coming , the young that are consecrated are offspring of a priest . Others may offer their young , if they are needed for the greater good . But most are mine , or another priest 's . " <p> George shook his gray head . It was too much to think about . The alien held up the scanbox . George raised his hand to reach for it , then changed his mind and let his hand drop in his lap . He gazed down at his veiny pale fingers instead . <p> When he looked up , the alien had gone . He sighed . He hoisted himself up off the bench , palms flat against its surface . He walked slowly , the only way he could walk many days , back into the great west door . Sunlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the miracle windows cast blobs of green on the stone floor . <p> As he walked , George passed the northwest transept and the martyrdom s tone . He stopped to trace the letters with the toe of his shoe . He remembered the stimfield image , the one that had horrified the Kputkp priest , the one he had replayed two or three times a day for nearly fifty years . For the first time , the brutality of it disgusted him . <p> Something crinkled against his side . The letter in his pocket . He would sooner go home and write Marina than stay here today . He found a curate and arranged for him to take over the day 's tours , pleading illness . The young man was kind about it , but George knew that later he would say that it was just more proof the old man should be retired , and room made for some new blood , someone not living in the past . Never mind . He took off his cassock and went home . <p> Home was a flat just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone . The furnishings were much as he had found them when he first came to Canterbury : beige and brown chairs that sculpted themselves to the occupant 's body , their supposedly indestructible fabric showing the signs of half a century 's wear . The building dated from the fifteenth century , so there was a large stone fireplace in the middle of the parlor , remnants of wood and ash in it left from when he last lit it perhaps a year or two ago . He had an old-fashioned scanbox , the great big kind , too heavy to move . It would play the new scans , with full sensory output , but the library of cartridges he had on a shelf nearby were all the very old kind , that read actual text directly into the eye . You could make the images yourself . You could see what you wanted to see . <p> Marina understood , almost . He extracted her letter , now crumpled , and flattened it in front of him . Marina , with her hair so fine you could hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl , by most people 's lights , but with a certain brightness behind her eyes that suggested intelligence as well as humor . <p> He dozed in his chair , the letter still clenched in his paper-white fingers . <p> He woke in the morning to the bleating of the seephone . It was a moment before he recognized the sound , he used the thing so seldom . Joints stiff , he shuffled to the console . For a moment he wished Museum Earth offered its residents the more modern appliances , like a seephone that came right over to you . <p> It was Marina 's mother , her dark hair partially hidden by a vine-covered hat . She scratched at the corner of her eye . " George . It 's about Marina . " George waited . " She 's dead . " Marina 's ship had been taken out by a pulse weapon left behind as a sort of land mine in space , she told him . <p> George stayed in his chair the rest of the morning and into the afternoon , conscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stale odor of the clothes he had slept in , the pinch of the thick-soled black shoes he 'd never bothered to remove . He stared at the wall ahead of him . He remembered telling her that William the Conqueror signed with a cross because he could n't write . She had made a cross with her finger in the air . <p> He held Marina 's letter in his hand , printing it with sweat . The ink faded and ran , and made marks on his fingers . The letters smeared so they could n't be read , even if you knew how . <p> The alien did n't announce himself with a knock , did n't wait to be asked in . He just appeared in front of George 's chair , back to the fireplace . George looked up at him and said nothing . <p> " Father , I have heard , " he said . " Your human wars come home to you . Do you still have faith ? " <p> George thought for a long moment . He wanted to tell the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself around George , reshaping itself like a womb as he sunk deeper inside it . The alien snaked out an appendage and stroked lightly , comfortingly , across his arm . <p> " How can you understand ? You lose your children  --  you kill them yourself !  --  routinely . You ca n't possibly understand . " <p> " There is a greater love . " <p> The message from the Archbishop of Canterbury , Primate of the Church of England , came the following morning . George was summoned to a meeting with the Archbishop within the hour . He dressed and hurried as best a man his age could . His eyes were still sore and red . <p> He paused as he entered through the cloisters near the spot where the alien had run screaming from the tour . The image stuck in him like a dull blade . He wondered for the first time whether Thomas Becket was the appropriate symbol for this place . <p> The church was n't open for visitors yet . Though the soles of his shoes were soft , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the saints and kings buried beneath the floor and remembered in words chiseled into the surfaces and worn with age , so that many were barely legible and barely recalled . <p> He paused as he passed the choir screen , his fingers running across the carving . He passed through the screen , up the center aisle flanked by the burnished wood pews , and genuflected before the high altar . He circled left around the sanctuary to the apse at the east that housed the Trinity Chapel . Morning light yellowed the air and speckled the floor with the red and gold of the stained glass . George slid into the back pew and lowered himself to the kneeler . His knees cracked as his weight settled on them , and pain trellised up his back . <p> Head bowed , forehead resting on hands , he prayed for he knew not what . Guidance , he supposed .

He knew that now . <p> Yet he was n't ready to die . He was as afraid as anyone of death . Despite all he had told the dying over his years as a priest , in the final analysis his own faith was wanting . He feared death . He would not go , not yet . Where would he go instead ? <p> He poured out the questions until he had no more , then lifted his head to look for an answer . Instead , he heard the scuttling step of the alien behind him a distance . He raised himself , and turned . The alien rocked its head in acknowledgment . It started to leave , to give him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited for him . <p> " Just one question , Father , " George said to the alien . " I 've never asked your name . " <p> " Logosh , " or something that sounded like that , was its answer . George nodded and thanked it . The alien continued on its way . <p> George doddered to the southwest transept and through the door to the office complex , vintage twenty-second century , where he was to meet the Dean and the Archbishop . The bright artificial light , keyed to the wavelength components of natural sunlight , made him see spots . Squinting he made his way to the giant simulated oak door of the Archbishop 's conference room and pushed it open . <p> The Dean 's sharply creased creamy gray trousers showed a single neat wrinkle at the knee where they bent against the eighteenth century walnut chair . His crisp black shirt was like perfect night against the pure white of his collar . White , George noticed for the first time , did n't suit the man . It made his fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the head of the walnut table , leaning his elbows on the surface scarred with generations of leaning , eating , writing living . The man was almost as old as George , though with stem , hawkish features and black pinprick eyes . His hair was thick and steely silver , like the silver of the heavy rings on his fingers and the ornate cross that dangled from his neck , swinging like a corpse at the gallows , tapping lightly against his chest . <p> George waited to be asked to sit . The Archbishop poked a finger toward a vacant chair across from the Dean . George settled himself into it . The carved back pricked his spine in several places like a medieval torture device The surface of the table gleamed and reflected . The room smelled faintly of lemon . <p> The Dean spoke first . " I 've conveyed to the Archbishop the information I 've recently received regarding the practice of our faith on Kputkp . I told him you were in a position to confirm some of it . " <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where none was due . George went along as he always had . " Father Logosh of Kputkp has shared with me some of their customs . He has also showed me how well the gospel is practiced in his world . There are no wars there . No famine . Everyone cares for each other . Our Lord 's kingdom has indeed come , in many ways . " <p> The Archbishop drummed his fingers , peering at the Dean rather than George . " I thought you said they performed child sacrifice . " <p> The Dean glared at George . George took it as his cue to answer . " One must understand their culture  --  " <p> " Child sacrifice or no ? " ' The Archbishop 's cross beat a tattoo on his chest . <p> " I 'm not sure . " <p> " If there is child sacrifice , they 'll have to be excommunicated . We ca n't have them calling themselves part of the Church if they murder babies . " <p> " The question is the greater good , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> The Archbishop finally addressed himself directly to George . " Do they kill children ? " <p> " They celebrate the Eucharist , in the way that is true for the people of Kputkp . " Who do you say that I am ? was the question that passed through George 's mind . <p> " This requires further investigation , do n't you think ? " the Dean said . <p> " We do n't have anyone we can send that far for so long . We do n't even know they 'd make it alive . " <p> " I could go . " <p> The Dean and the Archbishop looked at each other . George knew from their expressions that this was an easy solution to a problem they had already discussed . He smiled and went on . " And perhaps Father Logosh would like to stay here , and study the history of the Church . I think you will find him very interesting . " <p> The Archbishop leaned back in his chair , the cross hitting his chest with an impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirt . " A possibility , " he said . When his elbows came up from the table , George knew the interview was at an end .
