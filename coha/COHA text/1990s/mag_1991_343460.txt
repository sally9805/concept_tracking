In the morning , men dug three small holes in the ground on the slopes of Dugen mountain , barely inside the Turkish border with Iraq and near the town of Uludere . Crying softly , a young woman approached through heavy rain , opened a blanket held close to her chest and handed the body of an infant swathed in a burial cloth to a man in a large turban . He laid the small body in a hole already filling with water ; he and others shoveled in earth . The men crouched and , as one prayed aloud , murmured after him in low voices . Their faces , and those of the women of the mother 's family who huddled , nearby showed only numbed resignation . <P> Little wonder . Death is becoming not just an everyday but a many-times-a-day phenomenon among the Kurdish refugees camped along the border . That morning on Dugen mountain , nearly 6,600 ft. above sea level , two more babies who had died the night before were buried . The milk in their mothers ' breasts had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from flight . So the infants were fed a little sugar dissolved in water melted from dirty snow . That drink gave them fatal diarrhea . <P> Conditions practically guarantee more deaths . " There are sometimes up to 40 people living under the same tent , " reports Dr. Gerard Salerio of the voluntary organization Medecins du Monde ( Doctors of the World ) , who returned to Paris from Uludere late last week . " These are not even tents ; they are stretched blankets . People are too ashamed to relieve themselves during the day , so they do it at nighttime , between the tents . There is no hygiene anywhere . " One doctor serves 100,000 people . As a result , says Salerio , " every day , 20 children are buried between the tents . Older people are dying too ; so are younger adults . They are dying , dying even as I speak . " <P> Many more will die unless massive help from outside arrives quickly . But attempts to coordinate an international relief effort got off to a late start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. military forces stepped in to begin a major effort . Some 50 big helicopters will ferry food , blankets and tents to Kurds on otherwise inaccessible mountaintops . U.S. soldiers will enter Iraq to set up organized refugee camps to replace the sprawls of squatters . The undertaking , dubbed Operation Provide Comfort , aims at supplying at least one meal a day to 700,000 Kurds for a month or so , until the U.N . and private relief organizations can pull themselves together enough to take over . <P> Will even that be enough to keep the death rate from taking a terrible leap ? If not , it is hard to see what would do so . At week 's end Washington counted $245 million contributed or pledged by 26 nations for relief since April 1 , about $45 million from the U.S. But these sums are far from adequate . Moreover , not much of the money has yet reached the refugees in the form of food , water , tents , blankets , medicine and other supplies . <P> Worse , distribution of whatever goods have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by some appalling snafus . Late in the week 21 planeloads of relief supplies had been delivered to the eastern Turkish town of Diyarbakir , but much of the material failed to get past the airport . Other supplies are rotting in the rain aboard trucks stuck on the dirt roads of southeastern Turkey .
