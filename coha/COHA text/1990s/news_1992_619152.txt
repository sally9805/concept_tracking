<p> CLINTON AND VIETNAM <p> Editor  --  I have just read Bill Clinton 's 1969 letter to his ROTC adviser , written to explain to his " friend " his views on the U.S. war against Vietnam . To me it was a beautiful letter ! And if he still has the values he expressed then : opposition to the war and his commitment to work daily to bring it to an end , as well as his commitment to public service and opposition to racism , I would definitely choose him as my preferred candidate of the five . Who , today , could possibly be in favor of the brutal war against the Vietnamese people , the napalming , the horrors of the devastation ? <p> I hope Governor Clinton will not " apologize " for his active opposition to the war , but will continue to oppose U.S. interventions ( read wars ) against Third World countries . And I hope young people will have the courage to just say " No ! " if asked to " serve " their country by going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land and leaving behind a kind of suffering that does not disappear when the war ends . His conclusion after researching a paper while a law student , that " no government really rooted in limited , parliamentary democracy should have the power to make its citizens fight and kill and die in a war they may oppose . . . " is , as ever , sound reasoning , and the moral basis for conscientious objection . <p> SALLY COOPER <p> Woodside <p> . <p> VIETNAM VET OUTRAGED <p> Editor  --  A recent commentary ( Chronicle , February 7 ) cited approvingly people who are anti-Vietnam War : " It was a badge of honor to admit you had lied . . . to get out of the draft . You were considered a fool if you let yourself go to Vietnam . . . " <p> Then , in your February 12 issue , columnist Art Hoppe characterizes Vietnam veterans : " All too many of them , in my mind , were too cowed , too stupid or too unlucky to escape that dreary , unrewarding fate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , is a Vietnam veteran , which might well lose him my vote . " and " I can therefore forgive him winning the Medal of Honor . Just plain bad luck . " <p> I believe that I speak not only for myself , but for hundreds of thousands of other Vietnam veterans , when I express my outrage and disgust that The Chronicle would print such garbage . <p> LEO T. PROFILET <p> Los Altos <p> . <p> BUSH DOES N'T GET IT <p> Editor  --  From the shameless campaign he waged four years ago with its flag factories and Willie Horton , to his kicking the Vietnam syndrome by turning the sands of Iraq to glass , it 's clear to me that this guy just does n't get it . <p> Never has . Never will . Never mind . <p> KURT KLAPWYK <p> Reno <p> . <p> BLAME THE MIDDLE CLASS <p> Editor  --  Now that the 1992 political season is in high gear , the most disgusting drivel comes from sniveling liberal politicians who somehow feel justified in blaming the rich for the economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fiscal woes of this country have been brought on by the middle class through the following : <p> 1 . Failure to develop and maintain the skills needed to improve productivity and compete in a global economy . <p> 2 . Uncontrolled consumption and reckless spending which has buried the middle class in staggering debt . <p> 3 . Irresponsible voting decisions which have given us a Congress dominated by big-spending liberal bozos who should not be trusted with horse droppings , much less the hard-earned wages of the American worker . <p> Until it moves out of denial and accepts full responsibility for the problems that are stifling economic growth , the American middle class will continue to know economic pain . <p> EARL LU <p> Saratoga <p> . <p> HARASSMENT ISSUE <p> Editor  --  Last month , the L.A. Times criticized Barbara Boxer , D- S.F.-Marin , for beginning a Senate campaign letter with a reference to Anita Hill . The editors at the Times understandably want to see pocketbook as opposed to social issues at the fore of this year 's political debate . But in light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem of sexual harassment should not be relegated to the backburner . If Boxer  --  one of only six women in the country running for the Senate  --  does not tackle the issue , who else will ? John Seymour ? <p> MATTHEW DALLEK <p> Berkeley <p> . <p> THROWAWAYS <p> Editor  --  The " right to life " letter ( Chronicle , February 12 ) was correct about just one thing : abortion is n't " dealing with cats and dogs . " We allow millions of unwanted cats and dogs to be born each year and then we put them to death " humanely . " Millions of unwanted human babies are born annually to miserable lives of abuse , abject poverty and neglect , or are thrown away for society to cope with . And we call that humane ? <p> MARC ASKEW <p> Sacramento <p> . <p> ' INQUISITION ' <p> Editor  --  After reading the article , " Stanford Students Denounce Remarks " ( Chronicle , February 12 ) , my faith in the stupidity and malice of the human race was restored . This reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gay remarks puts me in mind of the techniques of Savonarola and the Inquisition . Perhaps they should have an auto-da-fe and , if he does n't recant , burn him at the stake . <p> His remarks , if reported correctly , were indeed in poor taste . However , this scarcely justifies the ensuing hullabaloo . A letter of censure might be appropriate . I suppose that the fanatics who have created the uproar have never made a heterophobic remark . <p> CHAPMAN BURK <p> El Cerrito <p> . <p> EAST BAY FIRE VICTIMS <p> Editor  --  I have read the Economic Scene column , " East Bay Fire Victims Should Expect Hassles , " by A. Lawrence Chickering ( Chronicle , February 11 ) . The city of Oakland has taken measures to streamline the entire rebuilding process and to be as cost-sensitive and efficient as possible . Substantial progress has already been made . <p> 1 . The city of Oakland has instituted a One-Stop Permit Center that has reduced , by more than half , the amount of time needed to issue permits . <p> 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was formerly legal , even though it might now be considered as " non-conforming . " However , all new structures , throughout the city , must conform to current seismic and fire safety building codes according to their areas and locations . For example , new codes now require that houses must be bolted to their foundations and fire resistant roofing is now required in some locations . It would be foolish and irresponsible to knowingly allow the rebuilding of structures that would be vulnerable to the same set of tragic circumstances . <p> Meanwhile , the city of Oakland is prepared to work closely with homebuilders and to steer and facilitate the rebuilding of neighborhoods in the Oakland Hills <p> CRAIG G. KOCIAN <p> Assistant City Manager <p> Oakland <p> . <p> IN MEMORY OF GRACE <p> Editor  --  I 'm an angry student from the University of California in Berkeley . The reason I 'm writing is because I have lost a dear friend who was stabbed to death in the office of the Pilipino American Alliance in Eshleman Hall . <p> In many ways I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rualo Asuncion . She was one of the people who helped me live my life the way it should be . She helped a lot of people who had problems , but when she had her own problems she kept it to herself . <p> In other words , whatever happen to Grace Rualo Asuncion , it 's very unfair and disgraceful . Not a day goes by when I , Ernesto N. Javier , wish I could find her killers and put them to justice . <p> ERNESTO N. JAVIER <p> Berkeley <p> . <p> HERO CABBIE <p> Editor  --  As a San Francisco cabdriver , I was shocked to hear of the recent verdict in favor of Ocie McClure . The message is all too clear : do n't get involved . <p> On the front page of The Chronicle of May 4 , 1989 , Mr. McClure is described as being 210 pounds , on parole for a burglary conviction , and , according to police , has a long arrest record . In addition , he appeared to be reaching for a gun . Excessive force ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit of restraint . If anyone used excessive force , it was Mr. McClure as he brutally hit and kicked Chinro Sakia . It seems the wrong person is being sued . Charles Hollom is a hero and the recent judgment against him in no way tarnishes his brave deed . <p> BILL UNGER , cabdriver <p> Berkeley
