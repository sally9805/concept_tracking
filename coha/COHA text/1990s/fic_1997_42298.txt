# # <p> A Story Of Fatherhood <p> " ANDREW , DO YOU KNOW how much your daddy makes ? Do you know how much his time is worth ? " <p> It is four o'clock . The sun is far away . Winter can be deathly cold , even in North Carolina . The windchill , they say , will make it seem like ten below tonight . It 's best to keep inside , light a fire , wait for warmer temperatures . <p> " Andrew , your daddy makes $1,50o a day ... Fifteen hundred dollars . That 's how much people pay your daddy for his services . " <p> This could happen anywhere . They are inside an office building , a facade dominated by glass and bisected by an atrium . They are near a highway , just off I40 , within shouting distance of semis and police cars armed with radar guns . A management-consulting firm , an ad agency , corporate headquarters of a restaurant chain . A small business that sets up office-automation systems , a statistical-research company . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reno , there is someone who does exactly the same thing , or almost the same thing . <p> There is someone in Denver who is talking to his son , trying to impress the hell out of him . He is the senior vicepresident of Excellence in Marketing or Teledex Data Systems or Insight Behavioral Management . In the past week , he has been promoted to chief operating officer . Everything in the office must go over his desk now , everything . He has clearance on all outgoing products and correspondence . The boss has handed him the ball . Remember , though , his door is always open , and if you have any kind of problem , he wants to know . If you 're having a problem with Steve or Joe or Janet , he wants to know about it and we 'll work something out . <p> " Andrew , this weekend we 'll go to the park and toss around the football .... Would you like that ? Maybe we 'll go to Speedy 's on the way home for barbecue . Would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a desk . A graphics file on the computer marked " Son " reveals a message , a clumsily scrawled " I LoVe yOU DAddy " from the last time school was canceled and Mom could n't watch Billy , or Sam , or Christine , or Andrew . There was a snowstorm , a blizzard , and for a day driving was banned and the wide white streets transformed the city into the nineteenth century , a time free of automobiles . The snow was pristine , a dream , so pure it looked as if it had given birth to the word white . Soon the cars returned , spit exhaust , and churned up mud and slush , and dirtied the snow with a dark crust . <p> There were storms on the East Coast , too , and in the Great Plains , and maybe an earthquake in California . These disruptions punched holes in workweeks , delayed meetings , and overjoyed schoolchildren . Reminders of force more powerful , weather to humble you . <p> Still , most buildings were not leveled , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the aftershocks subsided , the offices filled once again . <p> # # <p> " Andrew , if you do well in school , you can have all this . If you go on to college and value your education , you can sit behind a desk like this .... Son , you 'll have pictures of your own family up here . " <p> In Houston , a man has been yelled at by his boss for losing an account . In Roanoke , time is money and a deal 's a deal and try to bump it up a couple thou . Andrew or maybe Sarah sits in the conference room while Daddy 's on the phone . With crayons and scrap paper , he draws houses and black Labs . She makes a happy face in the sun and smoke pluming from the chimney of a house . Daddy is on an important call . <p> In Bismarck , it will be too cold again to be outside . Most people have remote devices to turn on their cars , and at a quarter to five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointing little black squares toward the parking lot . <p> " Andrew , your daddy 's just been promoted . Do you know what that means ? That means people respect your daddy ; they think he can handle more responsibility . " <p> He squeezes his hand exercisers while he speaks . Tina keeps on drawing . Outside , the clouds are low again , looking like another storm . <p> Here is the problem : There is no Andrew . Or there are a thousand Andrews . <p> " Andrew , do you know how much your daddy makes ? " In South Bend , he 's just landed the Davis account . They 've signed on for a year , with the possibility of a threeyear extension if goals are met . There will be drinks after work at the downtown Marriott , a toast to a job welldone . A call home . He 'll be delayed . No , good news , find a nice bottle of wine . <p> The problem : There is no Andrew , but there is a vicepresident apologizing for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the idea of Andrew , age five or twelve or sixteen , sitting two doors away in the conference room , staining the glass-topped table with oily fingerprints , happy for his day off from school , waiting to go for pizza at lunch . There is the idea of Andrew , sitting in the front seat of the car on the way to the office , staring out the window at the plows making hip-high walls of snow along the highway . The car phone rings . Hello . Yes , on my way . I have my son . He wo n't be in the way . <p> Jane has brought her daughter as well , and she makes a paper-clip chain . When she finishes , she starts in on the rubber bands . A man in Iowa made a three-hundred-pound ball from rubber bands . The Guinness Book of Records says so . <p> After lunch , they are given a deck of cards . Andrew wants to play war , but Sarah does n't know the rules . Benjamin , in Great Falls , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He thinks it 's under the queen of diamonds in the fourth pile ; the problem is how to get it . The rules of solitaire are easy , but it 's hard to win . <p> Jamie , who turns twelve next week , knows how to surf the Net . There 's a free computer in Emily 's office . You can set him up there . <p> The problem is that there is no Andrew . He 's not in the corner office , no matter how many questions are shot his way . He 's not in the conference room , either , drawing heartbreaking thank-you notes to give to the secretary To JEANNETTE : tHANk YOu for giviNg me a DECK of CArDs . I haD FUNN on mY Snow dAy . <p> In Sandpoint tonight , out on the lake , there will be a fiery sunset , the kind postcards never capture . Daytona is cleaning up from a tropical storm . Opal , Gloria , Esther ; they name hurricanes after grandmothers . <p> " Andrew , Andrew , Daddy just made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is Friday and he is trying to close the deal in time for his son 's football game . It is close to championship time . The meteorologist said sleet was possible . He just has a few more letters to fax , a couple more numbers for the spreadsheet , and some verbiage to tweak . It 's not worth it to check his watch . He knows what time it is , and if he closes his eyes for long enough he can see the coach and players circled in the locker room , joining hands for the pregame prayer . <p> " Andrew ... " but there is no Andrew , just an empty chair where Andrew might sit or has sat in the past . Decatur is experiencing an unprecedented population boom . To seize the opportunities a flood of new consumers represents , but he 's unsure of how to finish . He can see the Peachtree Hotel from his corner office , its sparkling lights and glimmering windows , the glass veins for the elevators . Inside , there are tuxedoed partygoers and women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ballroom , ready to dance the night away until it 's tired of itself . There will be ice sculptures of swans and more shrimp cocktail than is necessary . There will be gimlets and Dewar 's straight up , and rum-andCokes for the newly minted drinkers , the younger associates , just out of college , tasting their first sips of the company 's largesse . <p> On a clear night , maybe tonight if the clouds lift and the predicted storm never hits , you can see Birmingham and its low-slung skyline , its cavernous steel mills and warehouses . During the early part of the century , workers forged railroad track . Now technology is taking hold , there are more-rapid ways to travel , more than ever people are communicating by fax , e-mail , teleconferencing . To keep your business out front , you need a solid , dependable network with links to information servers and multimedia access . Vanguard Data can design and install a custom network , specifically tailored to the needs and requirements of your business . Our work is top-notch , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The warehouses in Birmingham are empty , shells of vastness , air thick with dust and stillness and the faint , lingering burn of pour and cast . A few are available for rental , for museum benefits and charity fundraisers , and they bring in balloons and bouquets and marvel at the way bodies can look so small , even under a roof <p> In New Orleans , the artists and restaurateurs have moved in and transformed the warehouses into trendy eateries and sculpture studios . Thev like the windows , cutouts too big to be called square . They like the light , the reminder of the world outside . Even when it 's gray , you can still see and know where you stand . The forces that cover you are only a pane of glass away . <p> Andrew draws a picture of Mardi Gras , Bourbon Street packed with costumes , a float in the middle . He draws the people in the balconies , toasting the parade below . One woman pulls a poodle by a braided-leather leash . The two of them look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being trampled . <p> " Andrew , Andrew , do you . . . " but he 's not listening . He 's too busy completing his picture , dotting the sky with stars and a sliver of moon and , in the very background , mountains with pointy summits , even though there are no mountains anywhere near New Orleans . His dream is to see Everest , K2-places where snow never leaves . <p> In Jackson , by nine , there is already a pile of faxes because the East Coast takes advantage of the time difference . A pipe froze and burst under the gym of Smith Elementary School , and so he has his daughter along for the day . He asks his secretary to set her up with construction paper and Magic Markers . In the shadows of the Tetons , she will draw pictures of the ocean and the beach and the treasures she imagines lurk beneath the sand , waiting to be discovered by the metal detector she got for Christmas . Old coins , pirate jewelry , even gold . <p> They trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he fetches his wife after work and they ride the monorail to Mud Island . They walk along the scale model of the Mississippi , set in cement , so detailed it reproduces the grade of the riverbed . Sometimes a duck finds its way into the model , mistaking it for the real thing as it threads together states in no time at all . In high school , he brought girls here and cigarettes and as much vodka as he could manage without his parents ' noticing the deficit in the liquor cabinet . He prayed for a hand on his thigh . He will hope for a nip in the air , though he does n't know why . Everything to say was new , had to be magical . <p> Arkansas across the river . Two people stripping in a motel room , ready to find something , lending your body to a set of hands , fingertips you imagine taste salty . The next minutes hold everything essential . They do n't bother switching the TV off . If the news anchors only knew . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eighteenwheelers are idling . They might as well be a thousand miles away . The truckers crowd the breakfast stools , ordering steak and eggs , coffeeing up for the next leg . The cashier and the waitress are sisters . Their children go to after-school together . Third shift ends at two and they ca n't wait . <p> TPR Marketing is abuzz . The Little Rock office is about to land the Emerald account . The next few hours are crucial because in Phoenix they 're waiting for the final estimate before signing on . He closes his door ; sometimes he works better this way One hour . He has promised the chief the outgoing memo and project estimates in one hour . His son is about to take the field and catch a touchdown pass or miss a tackle and get yelled at by the coach . The stands are full of teenagers with all the time in the world . It is cold enough to see their breath . <p> It is chilly in Phoenix , too , rare for desert country . He has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his recommendation to the president by the end of the day . Taped to the wall is a picture his daughter drew . A train rumbles through mountains , stilted on a high , curving bridge . " Daddy , this is the train I want to take on vacation , " the caption reads . " This train has glass on the ceiling so you can see out , even at night , and watch the planets . " She has drawn a line from the eyes of one passenger to Saturn . <p> " Andrew , do you . . ? " but there is no Andrew , only the knapsack he left from a previous day spent at the office . He will buy his son a Nintendo system and new Air Jordans and countless other treats that do n't even have names yet . With his si , 5oo-a-day consulting fees , he will hand his wife hundred-dollar bills to buy perfume and silk scarves . They will tour condos in Miami , San Diego , maybe even consider a ranch in Wyoming , anywhere people go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not rare . The sky is impossible and blue , wide enough for sun and moon , ocean and mountain . His office overlooks the old town square , and Friday nights hum with teenagers . From his window , he sees them gathering . His tie is loosened , his sleeves rolled up . The teenagers , with their pressed jeans and perfect shoes , would probably think he looks messy . Too many of them smoke , and it makes him crave a cigarette , but he has told his wife he quit . It 's one promise he wants to keep , because he can . <p> A few more numbers , a few more graphics to make the whole thing shine . Then he 'll overnight it to Chicago and cross his fingers . They need this account ; it could be the ace in his pocket . Closing a deal like this shows you can take down the elephant . Things like this do n't go unnoticed , especially upstairs . <p> Andrew wears a Bears jacket . He has posters in his room of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said , " Stay close .. . . And remember , if you get lost , go to the refreshment stand and wait . I 'll find you . " <p> " Andrew , Andrew . . " but he does n't hear . He 's started a new drawing , trying his hand at replicating the glossy action shots of football players . One catches a pass . Another lines up a field goal . A third player takes off across the lake , running on the surface of the water toward Canada . <p> His father looks over his shoulder and thinks about asking how the player keeps from sinking , but he remains quiet , admiring his son 's concentration . Lake Michigan is a few miles away . The snow will begin soon , and when the asphalt is cold enough the city will turn white . It will snow over the lake , too , and the flakes will disappear as soon as they hit the water , and it will seem for a moment as if they never were . But the sand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too restless to freeze , but elsewhere things are calmer and snow becomes a blanket . <p> He has all these dreams for Andrew . He wants him to letter in two sports , go to a good college , marry a beautiful girl . He knows this is nothing new , but it does n't matter . At night , when his wife is curled next to him in bed , he lies awake , still taut from work . The wine at dinner helps ; the sexy lingerie she has started wearing helps , too . Yet there is something that locks his body . When he stares at the ceiling , he sees nothing . The steady breathing to his left scares him , makes him jealous . The snow will accumulate to six inches by daybreak , and he might have to bring his son to the office again . <p> In the middle of the night , at two or three , one of those vague hours , he gets up and walks around the house . Andrew 's door is open a crack . Tina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it open halfway . Snow squalls glow in the halo of a streetlight . In Los Angeles , the aftershocks have ground almost to a halt . Miami is finally asleep . <p> He ends up at the picture window in the kitchen and sits down at the table . Snow has filled the birdbath ; he hears the water pawing the shore ; a mild rumble tingles his feet . With a glass of whiskey , he toasts the window . " To Elvis , " he says and downs the drink in one long sip . <p> The stairs creak under his weight as he heads back to bed . The liquor warms him , even if it is only for a moment . If he is insistent enough , maybe his wife will wake up , open a drowsy eye , and they can spend the rest of the night forgetting about tomorrow morning . Fuck the 8:3o meeting . <p> " Do you know how much your daddy makes ? " but there is no Andrew , and he has missed the game . The final proposal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cover letter on top , and faxed it over . Now they will have to wait . <p> " Wind 's a bitch tonight , " the president said when he left . <p> He turns off the lights , shuts down the computer , and lingers by the bookcase . There is a couch in the office ; there are couches in a thousand offices-in Grand Rapids , Seattle , Burlington , Sioux City . He could sleep here if he wanted to . <p> The only car left in the parking lot belongs to him . He wishes he had one of those gadgets to turn on the car by remote . They usually run the football scores on the eleven o'clock news , and if he drives fast enough he 'll catch the broadcast . <p> If Andrew is home , it means they lost . If he is out , it is because they won and he is celebrating with friends . The highway is two minutes from the office . In Minneapolis , he is glad for the skyways and the indoor garage . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truckers , arrowing snow to the shoulders of the road . Parts of Atlanta might see frost . The partygoers will notice how much colder it is when they leave than when they came in . <p> In Austin , the game was important . In Billings , too , and Lexington , and Armonk . " Andrew , Andrew . . . " but he is in postgame , peeling off his jersey and pads , listening to the coach 's analysis , watching the trainer tape an ankle . He knows his father did n't make it ; the stands were crowded but not that crowded . Whether he caught the winning touchdown does n't matter . If you ca n't see something , it might never have happened . <p> Ten minutes from home , right off the exit , land has been cleared for a new office park . Backhoes and dump trucks stake out a rough rectangle . Andrew had the toy versions when he was little . Whispering Pines Corporate Campus is 75 percent leased . Occupancy by August . Wo n't you join us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> He pulls off the road and drives into the clearing . The tires chew gravel , and he parks in the middle of the flattened and naked land . The moon has emerged from the clouds tonight and it lights the heavy machinery , Tonkayellow turned silver and dark . <p> The cheerleaders were at the game , cupping their hands , doing their best to inspire his son . At the end , their faces were wet with heartbreak and they held each other , hugging , trying to choke back the sadness their throats are still too young to swallow . <p> He drives around the lot in a circle , and then another . The night is quiet . In the morning , the work site will crackle with activity . The backhoes will dig wide foundations , and the dump trucks will ferry away the land . But for now , only the blueprints know what the final buildings will look like . <p> As he drives home , he checks the rearview mirror . The sky has consumed the office park and passed it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The roads are nearly empty . It has been a long week everywhere . The dashboard clock says it 's midnight , too late to watch the news and check if his son 's team won . He removes the cell-phone cord from the lighter socket . No one needs to reach him this late . <p> He pulls into his driveway . All of the lights in the house are off . The night amplifies everything ; unlocking the door sounds unnaturally loud . Maybe he has a dog , or two cats , inside for the night because it is too cold even for them . Maybe there is a note on top of the day 's mail : " Leftovers in the fridge , if you 're hungry . " <p> " Andrew ? Andrew ? " but his son is asleep , and the only answer he hears is the staggering loneliness of ten thousand darkened rooms . <p>
