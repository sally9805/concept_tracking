As soon as the airline officials and I finished negotiating about my luggage , gone astray with my clothes for the wedding , I collected the rental car and drove to Hillary 's house . <p> She hugged me , " Come into the kitchen . Are you parched ? Flying turns me into yesterday 's toast . " <p> I laughed and we sat at the counter under her iron loop of copper pots and waited for the kettle to boil . Outside , chatter was filling the servants ' rooms with a language I could not understand . It took me back to childhood when the sound of Magdalena talking with friends in the yard and my parents talking with friends in the house fused with everything else I did not know and could not imagine . <p> " I 've got twenty lists . " Hillary sounded overwhelmed by the detailed dovetailing the wedding demanded . She 's never enjoyed the power of administrative accomplishment . I wanted to show her I understood why she was handling the logistics on her own . Henry had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not even for his son 's wedding . Not now , when the whole country was waiting for the move everyone expected . " The papers say de Klerk might release more prisoners before New Year 's . " I was thinking of the most important prisoner , epitome of the change in my birth country . <p> Hillary 's silence rebuked me for fishing . " I 'll just tell the maid where to put the wedding flowers . " <p> She went into the servants ' yard and stood on the concrete floor next to a concrete sink . I could not hear what she said but I heard her maid answer , " Yes , Madam . " <p> When she came back , I asked , " Where do you want me to stay ? " " We 've been so busy we have n't had a chance to sell my mother 's house . I hope you do n't mind . The maid 's still there looking after things . " <p> As I nodded , the bridal pair splashed into the kitchen with hugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I told them . " With the rest of my luggage . " <p> " But you 're here . Tell us everything . " <p> I was thinking how lucky they were to live at this moment when the whole country and the world would see a change momentous enough for myth . How lucky to share their day of joy with the joy I had been hearing on the news as first one , then many prisoners were released and were met by singing and dancing . The last few months had been extraordinary-students put flowers in the barrels of guns in South Africa and crowds poured out of East Berlin . The land of my birth that had suffered so long , drought stricken and ostracized , and the land of my parents ' birth , also a prison , were full of people saying , " Freedom . " They hugged strangers at the news . Every day anticipated the next with joy . <p> How lucky we were to have the wedding at a time that pinned our personal joy to joy in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hillary needed to speak with her maid . I had to buy clothes , and to call Karen . I drove to the dead woman 's house through familiar streets lined with plane trees hardly changed since the afternoons I had walked under them to my music teacher 's , the same dapple of leaves and sun , the same mottled trunks , the same brick houses behind them . My music teacher , about the same age as Hillary 's mother , had probably died by now . She had fled Vienna just in time and her stories fused with those of my parents about the persecutions in Europe . In my mind , they fused with the lives of the servants I heard in the back yard . <p> The maid , wearing a pink apron , was expecting me . She introduced herself as Rosemary and showed me to the room where I would sleep in the dead woman 's bed . That was the first time I saw the floor to ceiling cast iron bars of a " rape gate " between the entrance hall and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could be . Then horror of the fear it showed . How could things have gone so far that people would lock themselves into cages in their own homes . Would the country ever be able to recover from such insanity . <p> I did not believe any one wanted to rape Hillary 's mother , though I knew that some places had come close to civil war . <p> " I 've got to have a shower , " I said . <p> " Would Madam like me to run a bath for her ? " Rosemary asked . <p> The offer took me aback . Even in South Africa , I did not expect such services . I declined . <p> While I went off to the bathroom and dressed again in the clothes I had worn since London , she made tea , and when I came out , brought it to me on a tray and set it on a table between the two armchairs that filled the space between the widow 's bed and the door . <p> Almost nothing in all my returns had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tray I had not asked for , with its embroidered doily , teapot , milk , sugar , water , and a plate of tennis biscuits . My mother would have received the same tray when she asked a servant for tea . On the verandahs of ocean hotels , on office desks and in the secluded space behind the shop counter where the owner has a chair , I had seen the same tray . When I visited Africans in their own homes and they wanted to do the proper thing , they would bring this tray . Pungent with familiarity , like the plane trees outside , it said , " Nothing 's changed . " <p> But everything had changed and was changing . I did not guess the extent of it until Rosemary asked , " Would Madam like me to stay ? " I did not know what she meant , and she must have seen my confusion , " My madam used to ask me to stay and talk . " <p> " Thank you , Rosemary . I ca n't talk now . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . " I did not tell her my clothes had gone astray . <p> I drank the tea wondering what we could have to talk about . What did she and Hillary 's mother talk about . Hillary ? Perhaps Rosemary had children of her own and talked about them . Magdalena , who lived in my backyard when I was growing up , had two children in Bethel . They never visited , and she did not keep photos in her room on the soapbox covered with an embroidered doily like the one on the tea tray . She kept a saucer with a candle butt there and her Bible and a red cigarette tin that , she told me one day , held coupons for the burial insurance she was buying . Her children hardly existed in my imagination , although the husband who came to be with her every second weekend was a real person , and Magdalena sometimes took time to go to Bethel . <p> Years after she died , I went to the location there , but no one knew anything about Magdalena or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mud houses , their rusting roofs held in place by big stones , knowing that I did not know anything of the life of the woman who had cared for me for eight years , or the lives of other women like her . All I knew was that they lived the way my grandparents had lived , needing permission for everything . But how it was without running water , how Magdalena pored over her Bible by candlelight while our house blazed with electricity , about that , I knew nothing at all . <p> Even the first time I did not accept Rosemary 's invitation to talk I felt I was committing some wrong against her . <p> " How soon can you come ? " Karen asked . <p> " I 've got to buy clothes . The airline sent mine astray somewhere . " I 'd need a nap . " I 'll take you out to dinner . " <p> " Do n't be silly , darling . We want you here . " <p> At the shopping center , guards stopped me to search my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk of freedom , some things would remain . The inertia of institutions , the iron of habit , the mental cages and perhaps worse . The Reign of Terror in France followed a time when strangers hugged each other saying " Freedom . " <p> Authorized , I bought the necessities of life for the next few days and then , stupid with weariness , drove back to the dead woman 's home . Rosemary greeted me and offered me tea again , and talk again , and again I said no . " I did n't sleep last night and need to rest now . " <p> Of course she could n't imagine the exhausting flight . She had never been in a plane . She must have lived fixed as a tree in this place where she had worked years to serve a person , and now to guard furniture and empty rooms . With her presence alone . This woman with her heavy breasts and belly , a body full of hunger going back years , perhaps to a childhood in a place like Bethel . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees and brick houses , of Hillary talking irritably to her maid , and rumors that the day was at hand that would transform everything . Too soon , it was time to dress again . <p> Karen threw open the door and hugged me . Quickly , she led me to her living room , filled with flowers as always . Her husband Edward had founded a kindergarten where he would accept a white child only if the parents sponsored a black child too . A few years later , he declined children from fashionable families , to favor children of domestic servants . They were on a picnic the day he died . A sudden storm burst over the valley and he was running to scoop a child back to shelter in the farmhouse when a bolt of lightning found him , the tallest thing in a grass field . <p> Eight hours later , around midnight , her first night as his widow , Karen phoned me in America . <p> Those calls over continents and oceans and time zones-they 're supposed to make it easier to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Karen phoned from Johannesburg to say , " Edward 's dead , " the sky darkened . It must have been my pupils contracting with pain , but I thought it was the whole world going dark , Africa impoverished when his light went out . Just three months ago . <p> I was finding it hard to be in the room without him . She saw me looking round , feeling him missing . <p> " Come on New Year 's Eve , " she said , " We always used to celebrate alone . But this year , I want a few friends who knew Edward . It 's such a terrible holiday here , everyone drunk for days . " <p> Karen grew up in Denmark , and her conversation keeps the habit of seeing South Africa as an alien place . I was with her once when we saw a policeman twice her size dragging an old man by the back of his jacket . She stepped in front of them and scolded the cop . He was so surprised at this blazing fairy of righteousness picking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jacket and listened , bemused , while his victim fled . I was amazed . I did n't know a born South African who 'd have delivered such a spontaneous scolding . We were too trained to acquiesce . We did not know and could not imagine the decorum citizens in a free country expect . <p> At the same time , Karen is passionately in love with Edward 's country and filled their house with carvings and textiles that reveal her love . Now she is rooted in her past here , and will not live in Copenhagen again . <p> " I ca n't believe he 's really dead . He comes to me at night , in my dreams . Every night he 's with me . " <p> As she was talking , Betty , her maid , came in , talked about Edward . " It 'll never be the same , " she said quietly . <p> She has been Karen 's maid for thirty years . By now , they move with the same light , quick movements , and Betty knows exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for parents and donors and they both prepare plates of finger food and edible flowers . <p> Betty served dinner and Karen and I talked . <p> I said , " It 's so ironic , painful , that Edward is n't here to see the end of apartheid . " <p> " Who knows what will take its place , " she said . Foreboding from her . I was taken aback . " Or if anything will change . Habits die hard . " <p> After we 'd been talking a while , she said she was tired , and we moved to her bedroom . She 'd also had a rape gate installed when Edward died . Fear had found her after all . <p> I sat in the carved armchair he used to sit in when she was n't feeling well but still wanted people around . Where I used to sit , she had a Tv now . A salve for loneliness . <p> When I was too exhausted for more talk , she asked me to call Betty from the kitchen . " We watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family now . No , she had served the dinner but did not eat it with us . <p> I found her in the kitchen ironing panties . Panties ! Freedom takes learned skills . My mind flooded with thousands of habits and decisions that people here did not know and could not imagine . Like Karen 's instant outrage at that bullying cop . Who , in a free world , would choose to iron panties ? To compose that fussy tea tray ? To speak the syntax of servility ? The old laws might be about to die , but my first country looked likely to survive as a widow with gestures and postures locked in place . <p> When I came back to the dead woman 's house there was light in the room in the back yard where Rosemary lived , but behind the house next door the servants ' rooms were bright and loud with music and the voices of men drinking . They were getting an early start on New Year 's . <p> Rosemary was not with them . She was alone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out as I walked to the front door , " Did Madam have a good meal ? " and walked in front of me to switch lights on so I need not go into dark rooms . I wondered what she did all day when there was no one to tend to , and what she would do when Hillary sold the house . <p> I let my shoulders droop and jaw go slack to show that I was too tired for tea or talk . This time she did not offer , but I knew the pattern . I was wronging her , or had wronged her sometime ago , long before I knew or could imagine . <p> Author Affiliation
