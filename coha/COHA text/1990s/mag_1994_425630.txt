Musings on the Massif <p> On an autumn afternoon in Chile 's Torres del Paine National Park , the sun is setting behind the mountains , backlighting the clouds and saturating the entire scene with tones of pink . This phenomenon , some say , led the Mapuche Indians to name the mountains Paine , meaning pink ; others say Paine is the Tehuelche Indian name for blue  --  perhaps for the sky , lakes , or icebergs  --  since it is they who first lived there ; still others believe the area was named for an early European settler of the region . Whatever the derivation of its name , such sensory images have come to define Torres del Paine for all those who have dwelled and traveled there . <p> Located in Chile 's Region XII , Maga-llanes y de la Antarctica Chilena , the Macizo del Paine ( Paine Massif ) rises near the tip of the South American landmass , north of Seno de Ultima Esper-anza ( Last Hope Bay ) , where almost every name evokes a legend . The massif is essentially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nearly surrounded by the Paine River . Separated from the Andes by deep glaciers , the massif abuts the Patagonian steppe without transition , and the resulting vista juxtaposes two extraordinary landscapes in one . <p> The rare beauty of the Paine Massif , its glaciers , fauna , and forests , led to the designation of a portion of the area as a national park in 1959 , and as a bio-sphere reserve in 1978 . Today , at its current size of 450,000 acres , Torres del Paine is considered one of the hemisphere 's outstanding national parks . William C. Leitsch , in his book The National Parks of South America , praised Torres del Paine as " the sort of park that changes its visitors by setting standards of sheer sensory impact against which all other parks are thereafter measured . " <p> Undulating plateaus dominated by sepias and reds are gently punctuated by lagunas , lakes  --  the Dickson , Paine , Sarmiento , Nordenskjold , Pehoe , and Grey  --  and rivers with steep banks and waterfalls . Clouds seem to whirl through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The skyline seems to stretch into the hypnotic hues of the waters , some white , green , or turquoise , because of the algae , others grayish and ocher from the pulverized rocks left by the retreating glacier . <p> Pleistocene-era glaciations gave the massif its unusual shapes , uncovering granite and eroding the two legendary Cuernos ( Horns  --  8,530 feet ) and the three Torres ( Towers  --  6,500 feet ) into spectacular formations , which are still subject to folding . Cerro Paine Grande , to the west of these mountains , is the park 's highest peak , at just over 10,000 feet . <p> Looming on the horizon , dominating their surroundings , the Torres seem to beckon to all who behold them to come closer . As the days pass , however , one feels that their spell lies not in their height but in their form : They offer a whole world of lines , clouds , and rocks polished by glaciers . <p> On the west side of the Torres are vast ice fields . Enormous masses of moving ice lean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and others melt in the wind and sun . At the edges of the massif , where these different ecosystems meet  --  steppe and woodland , or mountain and water  --  there are exceptionally good spots for observing land animals and birds . They live protected in their natural surroundings , where silence is broken by little but the sound of the wind . Here visitors may find Magellan 's geese , long-tailed meadowlarks , Andean condors , Chilean flamingos , swans  --  such as the black-necked and the Coscoroba  --  and numerous species of ducks . <p> Forests of slender southern beech trees ( Nothofagus sp. ) , for example lenga , create a half-light , through which the graceful guanaco moves in small herds . A local symbol for freedom , as well as for wind or sea , the guanaco is the tallest South American mammal . Its likeness has been discovered in cave paintings found in the Las Manos cave on the Pinturas River in Argentina 's Patagonia . This splendid archaeological record testifies to the animal 's important role in the life of South America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expedition of the HMS Beagle arrived in Patagonia in 1832 , the young naturalist took note of the guanaco 's remarkable curiosity . He recorded that hunters who accompanied the expedition took advantage of that trait , throwing themselves on the ground to lure the guanacos to draw near . Jules Verne , too , wrote about the guanaco , beginning his novel The Castaways of the Jonathan with a description of this gregarious , ever-wary herbivore , its nose into the wind , sniffing the scents riding on the sea breeze , with speed its only defense . <p> The publication of Darwin 's journals , and those of other scientists and explorers , excited a class of adventurous tourists , drawing them to the far reaches of South America . In 1878 , at the age of twenty-two , Lady Florence Dixie , daughter of the Marquis of Queensberry , traveled to Patagonia from England and authored a travel book of her excursion , Across Patagonia . When her party first arrived at the Paine Massif , Lady Frances recalled : <p> now , as if by magic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glorious landscape had sprung up around us. . . . jagged peaks were cleft in the most fantastic fashion , and fretted and worn by the action of the air and moisture into forms , some bearing the semblance of delicate Gothic spires , others imitating with surprising closeness the bolder outlines of battlemented buttresses and lofty towers . The bare rock . . . was red porphyry and the morning sun glittering on it , lent it a variety of bright tints , purple and golden , which were thrown into striking relief by the blue background of the sky and the white masses of snow . <p> When she encountered the Torres , Lady Frances remarked that these " three tall peaks of a reddish hue " were " in shape exact facsimiles of Cleopatra 's needle . " This name , Cleopatra 's Needles , is still heard in the park today . <p> Four decades later , another young woman would be drawn to the Torres del Paine . At the time a schoolteacher in Punta Arenas , some 150 miles away , she would stay at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cottage that today bears her name : Gabriela Mistral . As a poet , Mistral came to be identified with a rough-hewn style , explosive and passionate . And , it is said , the Nobel Laureate 's first book of poetry , Desolacion , was inspired by the extremes of landscape she found at Torres del Paine : coarse and craggy plains , mountains blazing red at sunset , and fierce , unrelenting wind  --  like the mistral itself . As she wrote in her poem " Paisajes de la Patagonia , " translated below by her friend and translator , Doris Dana : TABLE <p> PHOTO : Considered by many to be the park of parks , Chile 's Torres del Paine National Park mesmerizes the scenes by its sheer , dramatic beauty . <p> PHOTO : Native fuchsias , animate the woodlands with bright colors . <p> PHOTO : The Torres del Paine , challenge climbers the world over . <p> PHOTO : Chilean poet Gabriela Mistral 's summer house , is located in Tres Pasos . <p> PHOTO : The Patagonian steppes , with the Paine Massif @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Park <p> By Parisina Malatesta <p> Photographs by Jorge Provenza <p> <p> Parisina Malatesta and Jorge Provenza are a writer-photographer team based in Caracas , Venezuela , who are regular contributors to Americas . <p>
