Weather stories have filled science fiction recently . From John Barnes ' novel Mother of Storms to Bruce Sterling 's Heavy Weather , the changing climate of these United States and , indeed , the world has riveted us . <p> Today it 's a German crew , one blond under the camera and the other shoving his microphone at faces , slowing work that never moves fast enough . With a grating tone of false pity , the reporter asks how we are coping with this latest tragedy . Eight centimeters last night , ten or twelve upriver , and do we know that the latest estimate is for a crest almost a meter higher than our levee ? He acts exceedingly confident . about his math , and milled beneath everything . Did he come here this morning hoping to find us washed away ? Or maybe he wants us to give up , to let the levee fail for him , his camera able to catch the angry brown water charging down our streets . Just like in Tylertown . The CNN crew got that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen it at least twenty times . Six-plus billion people have seen my sister 's house vanish under the flood , and it 's been under ever since . Two months ever since .. You 've seen it . That little white house on the right ? With rose bushes and the big blue spruce ? Sure you have .... <p> Anyway , the Germans are working their way toward me . I 've slept four hours in the last fifty , living on sweet rolls and ibuprofin , and I 'm so tired that I 'm shaking . A big strong guy by design , but these sandbags weigh tons and tons . And my mood is past lousy . I 'm sick of cameras and the rain , and I 'm sick of being worried , and suddenly it occurs to me that I do n't have to answer anyone 's questions . I do n't have to be the noble , suffering flood victim . If I want , I could throw one of these sandbags into the asshole 's chest . I could . And besides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than anything words can manage ? <p> Only I do n't get my chance , as it happens . <p> What happens is that this fellow two up from me  --  about the quietest , littlest guy on the levee  --  detonates when asked , " How do you feel ? " He does n't bother throwing a sandbag using fists instead , screaming and putting a few good shots into the German 's astonished face . It 's lovely , Perfect . Sweet . Then I help pull them apart , the German making a fast retreat ... and afterward it seems as if everyone on the levee is working harder . Faster . Honesty is everywhere , thicker than river water , and it feels as if it 's us against the world . Do n't ask me how , but it does . <p> The rains began last year , but not like this . A record September , but a reasonable record . Then a wet October , a cold dry November , and three months of crippling snow and ice . A winter to remember , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the country notice us . Mountainous ice jams pooled the runoff . The Grand River was plugged up for a week , the Interstate closed and white slabs of ice bulldozing their way through several towns . But the coverage was only national at its height , and then only for a few days . Nobody was killed until an elderly couple drove through barricades and onto a flooded stretch of highway . I watched that drama on television . Live . It was more exciting than any TV fiction , I 'll confess . Scuba divers dropped from a helicopter , perching on the sunken cat 's roof . Genuine heroes , they wrestled the limp bodies out of the cold foam , and only then did I feel a little guilty . I was enjoying the spectacle . Strangers had died , but I felt superior . I was warm and dry , safe inside my own house , and some wicked little part of me enjoyed the tragedy , even wishing for more of the same . <p> We lose our levee before dark . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's the meat of the levee itself , months of saturation leaving it soft and pliable , and porous . Two , three , then four places give way from below , water boiling up , nothing left to do but retreat and curse the luck of it . For just an instant , I consider slipping off to see my house one last time . It 's back from the river , on slightly higher ground , and maybe there 's hope . For the ten thousandth time , I entertain the image of building a private barricade , saving my property with a single superhuman effort . But one of the painful lessons in a disaster  --  the lesson that comes as a surprise  --  is how weak and ineffectual each of us can seem . The difference between human and superhuman is about two rows of sandbags . Which is rarely enough , I 've learned . Time after time after time . <p> In the end , we 're trucked to high ground and a refugee camp . Rain begins again , light for the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the trucks . CNN is here , of course . And ANBC . Plus a Japanese crew , and a Russian one . And the Brazilians . Plus a group I do n't recognize . Dark little Asians ... Indians , maybe ? <p> None of them speak to us . Maybe news of the fistfight has made its way through the ranks . Or maybe even the reporters realize that there are n't any new questions , and the old questions ca n't clarify what people around the world are seeing . " A ten-thousand-year flood , " I hear . " It 's official . " And I 'm thinking : What does that mean ? Ten thousand years ago we were coming out of an ice age . Each millennium 's weather is unique to itself . And if memory serves , are n't we in a new millennium ? Maybe this will be ordinary weather for the next thousand years . Who knows ? I know it 's not some asshole from CNN , let me tell you . <p> From the edge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can see down into the river bottom . We can see the advancing waters . My house is obscured by distance and the strengthening rains , and I 'm grateful for the rain now . I keep telling myself that everything of real worth has been removed . Even my major appliances have been pulled out and stored . So why the hell do I feel so lousy ? <p> The Indian crew comes over and sets up . <p> Only they are n't Indians , I learn . Someone bends close and says , " They 're from Bangladesh . " Then he repeats himself , for emphasis . " Bangladesh . You know ? Where it floods like this every year ? " <p> In accented English , I hear the word , " Tragedy . " <p> The small dark men seem to understand better than the rest , although it does n't stop them from doing their jobs . Their cameras beam home images of destruction and despair , as if to prove to their pitiful homeland that even rich Americans can experience Nature 's horrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March seem dry . In memory . <p> Then came May , which was easily worse . I remember a puffy-faced weatherman reporting afterward that we had three arguably blue-sky days in all of May . We 'd already exceeded our average annual totals in precipitation . But June stayed just as cheerless , just as strange , the jet stream deciding to come over our heads , steady as a highway , delivering Pacific moisture to a band of six midwestern states , every night beginning and ending with barrages of heavy rain and hail and wind and more wind . <p> My sister 's house was lost in June , little warning given . Her family escaped with the proverbial clothes on their backs , and when I last talked to her , she was trying to live with her in-laws in Greendale . Seven people in a trailer , a marriage straining like ... well , like every levee image you can devise ... and all she said was , " If only the rain would stop . That 's all I want . Why is that too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know exactly when  --  I began to watch every weather forecast with an obsessiveness and a growing frustration . Waking in the middle of the night , I 'd flip on my bedroom television and turn to the Weather Channel , waiting for that glimpse of the radar with its map and neat colors and the time-lapse sense of motion . Great glowering red storms would form , then march along until mid-morning . Then the summer sun would lift the humidity , new clouds forming , the sticky remnants of last night 's storms seeding fresh ones , the pattern scarcely changing from night to night . <p> Our city 's levee was the best , we heard . Tall and thick , and tough . And our city administrators treated doubters with scorn , as if doubt itself could undermine all the good Federal dollars that went into the long embankment . <p> <p> By July , the pattern was clear . The worst of the rains fell on a narrow band just upstream from us . Our climate made tropical people wilt . The upstream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us was filled to overflowing . Then it did overflow , the Army Corps of Engineers having no choice but to release the excess water , letting it slide over the top in order to save their fragile earthen dam . <p> By then the world was watching us . The Midwest in general , but us specifically . Our dramas were featured on every news program , in practically every nation . News teams were dispatched , thousands of technicians and reporters helping to absorb the scarce hotel and motel rooms . For all the reasons people watch tragedies , we were watched . Never before had so many cameras showed so much disaster and to such a large audience . I 've heard it claimed that the Third World , full of superstitious people , particularly enjoys the dramatics : These floods are judgments from the gods . Americans have been rich and happy for too long goes the logic . Too much success leads to misfortune . In other words , we deserve our suffering . I know I feel that way sometimes . I 'm not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , at my failures , wondering why the Lord is spending so much time and effort trying to drown poor me . <p> Back in July , someone hired an American Indian  --  an official shaman  --  to come and try to dispel the rain clouds with dancing and chants . It was considered an amusing story in New York City ; but locally , without exception , people found themselves hoping for the best . Even committed skeptics waited eagerly for some change in the jet stream ; and for a couple days without warning , it did swing north , leaving us out from under the worst of the storms . But one Indian was n't enough , it seemed . That high altitude river of air returned , and August  --  normally a dry and hot cleansing month  --  began with tornados and a three inch downpour . <p> Sixty-two inches by then , which is twice our yearly norm . <p> Reservoirs full . Fields and downtowns underwater . Every old record made ridiculous , and the nervous and sullen weatherpeople admitted finally that there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were no help , it seemed . Perhaps by September things would slacken , they would say . Maybe , maybe . We could always hope . <p> It rains into the night , hard and then harder . <p> When I was a boy , I loved rain . Now just the idea of water failing from the sky seems horrible to me . I close my eyes and dream of deserts . Sand is a beautiful concept , particularly when it 's baked dry and capable of burning flesh , and I dream of lying naked beneath a fierce blue-blue sky , letting myself broil . <p> Then I wake and sit up , aching through and through . <p> I 'm sharing a prefab shack with a couple dozen other people , most of them awake and watching a portable battery-powered TV . The news has a new drama building . The reservoir downstream of us  --  a tremendous inland sea built by the once god-like Corps  --  is being assaulted by runoff and its own intense storms . The thunder we hear is just the tip of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh water will fall in the next hours . And the Corps ' spokesman does n't seem convinced by his optimistic statements . " Ten inches is within our tolerance , " he claims , words slurring from a lack of sleep , or maybe a love of drink . " The dam is solid . The excess will drain over the spillway . Yes , there 's going to be flooding downstream . We ca n't prevent flooding now . But the reservoir will stay where it is , unless  --  " <p> " Unless ? " the reporter interrupts . <p> Did I say unless ? he seems to think . He pauses , collecting himself , then tells the world , " A strong wind could be dangerous . If it was big enough , and if it blew from the northwest for a long time ... it could start to erode the dam ... I suppose ... " <p> " You are n't sure ? " <p> " It 's unlikely , " says the spokesman , suddenly confident . " It would have to blow at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean  --  " <p> " How unlikely is unlikely ? " <p> " I would n't know how to calculate such a tiny number . " The tired , possibly drunken face seems unable to calculate anything just now . " Really , I do n't think there 's much else I can tell you . " <p> That concludes the interview , and the reporter says , " Well , our prayers are with you . " <p> Meaning what ? I ask myself . <p> We hope the rains stop ? Or is he saying We hope you do n't look like an idiot in the morning ? <p> I remember one night  --  a sleepless thundering Weather Channel night  --  when I watched one of the multitude of documentaries produced in the last months . Why is weather so difficult to forecast ? One grinning meteorologist spoke of chaos and butterflies . No , not butterflies . Butterfly effects , was n't it ? He told me how tiny , tiny events can precipitate into weather fronts and typhoons . Or have no effect , for that matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events will have what impact . And to illustrate , the grinning man waved his hand in the air , saying , " For all I know , this is making a disturbance that will circle the globe and flatten Tulsa with a tornado . Though it probably wo n't . Almost certainly wo n't . " A shrug of his shoulders . Doing what kinds of harm ? " Minuscule events can lead to massive consequences . That much we do know . " A flash of teeth . " Is n't that interesting to consider ? " <p> Moments after the interview ends , as if with some cosmic signal , we hear the wind begin to rise . To strengthen . <p> It flows sideways over our shack , making the walls and roof creak and shift . Its direction is obvious . Ominous . And not too much later , every network interrupts its late-night programming to bring news from the reservoir . Camera crews are sprinkled along the dam 's crest . Already the waves are striking at the rock-faced shoreline , each larger than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rocks , then reaching higher , finding softer materials already weakened by months of pressure and angry water . <p> I do n't want this to happen . I want it to stop . <p> Yet what does one opinion have behind it ? Nothing , that 's what . And besides , am I at risk ? This is like watching those old people drowning last spring : a gruesome part of me is thrilled , wondering how it will look , millions and billions of gallons racing downstream in a great apocalyptic wall , mud and cities carried along with the dead .... <p> That 's what happens now . <p> As we watch  --  as the world sits spellbound  --  those wind-driven waves find a deadly flaw . Earth slumps , then vanishes . The CNN crew watches a new channel being created , a new spillway equaling the first spillway , then exceeding it . <p> In a matter of minutes , the dam is ruined . Useless . <p> The camera crew retreats , in panic , leaving their equipment to fend for itself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downstream is being partially abandoned , and even New Orleans is filling sandbags . <p> In case . <p> The reporters abandon our camp before dawn , better mud needing their attentions . The largest dam failure in history is certain to kill hundreds , possibly thousands . The Corps spokesman from last night is one of the first casualties . A self-inflicted gunshot wound , we hear . And as I absorb the news , without warning , some inner voice says to me : <p> " He deserves death . It 's his fault , after all . " <p> But why ? <p> " You know why . " <p> Maybe it 's exhaustion , but my answer feels reasonable . Maybe the months of worry and work have ruined me , tearing away a thousand years of civilization , but I ca n't help thinking that the answer could n't be more obvious . <p> " Tiny events cause storms , " I tell my shack companions . My fellow refugees . " What if ? What if the human spirit can influence tiny events ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychic energies  --  call them whatever you want  --  and that 's how we can manipulate weather fronts and jet streams ? What happens then ? " <p> Nobody speaks . <p> Sleepless , half-dead faces gaze at me , nothing in them to read . <p> I give an impromptu lecture on chaos theory and butterfly wings , then conclude by asking , " When have so many people in so many places been able to think about one place ? In real time , I mean . As events happen . I mean , if there is some magic  --  call it magic  --  then is n't this the time when we 'd see it ? The world is wired together , cameras everywhere . Maybe there 's some way , some innate wish-fulfilling trick , that allows us to make the atmosphere move just so , bringing us this ... " <p> I pause , all at once doubtful . <p> And I confess , " I 'm nuts . I know . " <p> But someone responds , " No , wait . What about last night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Is n't that what the Colonel said ? And was n't it just minutes later when it started blowing  --  ? " <p> " Yeah , " someone shouts . " That 's how it was . It was . " <p> I feel ashamed , my companions infected with my insanity . We 're in the Dark Ages . We have fallen so far that we 'll believe every unlikely and horrible set of half-ideas . <p> " They want us to drown , " says someone . <p> " Who does ? " whispers a skeptic . <p> But before names are mentioned , someone else offers , " They do n't know they 're doing it . How could they know ? " <p> " So how do we protect ourselves ? " asks someone in back . An enraged , crimson voice . " Suppose it 's true . How can we stop people from doing this to us , intentionally or not ? " <p> Except for the patter of rain on the roof , the silence is perfect . <p> I pray for reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the will of multitudes ? <p> An Irish journalist is found shot to death in a flooded sorghum field . <p> Two Nigerian cameramen are hung with their own coaxial cable , the incident interpreted as being racially motivated . <p> In one day , three different news vehicles are peppered with small arms fire . <p> And while I 'm busy wondering about these terrible deeds , and am I in some way to blame , a bizarre new terrorist group bombs radar towers over a wide region , leaving the soggy heart of the nation blank , no way to determine the course and intensity of the latest storms . <p> Which are n't so bad , as it happens . <p> The truly bad news has moved downstream , taking most of the press with it . September begins with a week of uninterrupted sunshine . The lower Mississippi valley is submerged , but by October we 've seen the last of our dirty waters roll off our streets and through the empty reservoir . We are n't dry , but the concept of dry ground can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for anything more . <p> Of course the murders were just murders , I tell myself . <p> Ugly but simple in their intent . <p> And who knows why people would dynamite radar installations ? It has nothing to do with me . <p> And yet . <p> I find myself thinking about the people in my shack and how they must have spoken to friends and strangers , telling them of my idea . Ideas are like butterfly wings . Small beginnings ; catastrophic results . An idea like mine could flow through a population , seeking out the people most likely to believe in it . To act on it . To do what feels like the logical best course . <p> Make the world forget us . <p> Which it has , mostly . <p> A late-season hurricane strengthens , then takes aim at the Gulf Coast , flooding the remnants of New Orleans and shifting the Mississippi to a new channel in western Louisiana . <p> Eighty-three acts of terrorism against reporters and weatherpeople may or may not be linked with violence during last summer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CNN warrior reports to the world . <p> Armed guards standing around him . <p> What happens if the world realizes its power ? I ask myself . Will humanity shatter into opposing camps ? Or seek revenge on its enemies ? Or perhaps , just perhaps , create an Eden , tepid and green ? <p> I can remember when weather was a god unto itself . <p> Obeying no one . <p> ILLUSTRATION : MEDICAL CURIOSITIES pl . IV <p> <p> By Robert Reed <p> Robert Reed takes the large subject of weather and makes it personal and universal at the same time . He based " Our Prayers Are With You " on last summer 's floods in the Midwest ( he lives in Lincoln , Nebraska ) , but this story could just as easily be about this winter 's flooding in California . . . or the next disaster lurking in our near future . <p>
