Tito , talking about the winds of Alphonse Kauders , said : <p> " They sounded like all the sirens of Moscow on the International Labor Day . " <p> Alphonse Kauders had fertilized Eva Braun and she , in the course of time , had delivered a child to the world . But , after Adolf Hitler had started establishing new order and discipline and seducing Eva Braun , she , intoxicated by the Fuehrer 's virility , sent the child to a concentration camp . <p> Alphonse Kauders had hated horses .

" <p> Records exist that Alphonse Kauders had spent some years in a home for juvenile delinquents , having set seven forest fires in one week . <p> Alphonse Kauders said : <p> " I hate people , almost as much as horses , because there are always too many people around and because they kill bees and because they fart and stink and because they always come up with something , and it 's the worst when they come up with irksome revolutions .

Praising God , he is silent . " <p> Alphonse Kauders had known by heart the first fifty pages of the Berlin phone book . <p> Alphonse Kauders was the first to tell Joseph V. Stalin : <p> " No " <p> Stalin asked him : <p> " Do you have a watch , Comrade Kauders ?

And that was only due to the fact that he had informed on a bandit for secretly saying his prayers to God at night . <p> Alphonse Kauders said to Eva Braun : <p> " Money is n't everything . There is some gold too . " <p> Alphonse Kauders had been a fanatic beekeeper ; throughout his whole life he had led fierce battles against parasitic lice which ruthlessly exploited bees , and were known under the name " varoa . " <p> Alphonse Kauders said : <p> " The most beautiful fire ( not being a forest one ) I have ever seen , was when the Reichstag was in flames .

Girls from other classes would rush in crowds to see me stuff my fist into my mouth . My father , a teacher , glowed with a bliss to see all those girls around me . Once , a girl that I wished to make love to approached me . And I , having been excited , tried to shove both of my fists into my mouth . I broke two front teeth . Ever since I was noticed for my insanity . This event probably determined the course of my life . Ever since I do not talk .

And , as I live , it 's all too clear . The Judgment Day had come before I was alive . " <p> Alphonse Kauders narrated : <p> " When Rex and I would be having a conflict , and that was happening almost every day , he would stray and would be gone for days . And he would tell me nothing . Except once . He said : ' The stray dogs ' shelter is full of spies . ' " <p> On the eve of the Second World War , Alphonse Kauders , in Berlin , said to Ivo Andrich : <p> " A firm system still exists only in the minds of madmen . In the minds of others there is chaos , as it is around them . Perhaps art is one of the last lines of defense against chaos . And then again , perhaps it is not . Who the hell cares ?

And then , again , I shall be here . Everything is so simple . All one needs is the courage . " <p> Alphonse Kauders wrote to one of his seven wives letters " full of filthy details and sick pornographic fantasies . " Stalin forbade such letters to be sent by Soviet mail because " among those who open letters there are many tame , timid family people , " so then Alphonse Kauders sent his letters through couriers . <p> Alphonse Kauders said : <p> " I , I am not a human being . I , I am Alphonse Kauders . " <p> Alphonse Kauders said to Richard Sorge : <p> " I doubt there exists an emptiness greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better to have some tanks on the street , if nothing else is possible . Because Anything is better than Nothing . " <p> Alphonse Kauders , in the course of time , had put a revolver on Gavrilo Princip 's temple , for he had burned a bee with a cigarette . <p> Alphonse Kauders , in the course of time , said to Stalin : <p> " Koba , if you shoot Bukharin ever again , we shall have an argument . " And Bukharin was shot only once . <p> Alphonse Kauders said to Eva Braun , in bed , after seven mutual , consecutive orgasms , four of which had gotten into annals , Alphonse Kauders said to Eva Braun : <p> " A way should be found of forbidding people to talk , especially to talk to each other . People should be forbidden to wear watches . Anything should be done with people .

We set quiet houses on fire . We saw soldiers weeping . Crowds gushed out of prisons . Everybody was afraid . And we had nothing but the bad feeling . " <p> Albeit Alphonse Kauders hated people from the depths of his soul , almost as much as he hated horses ( Good Lord , how Alphonse Kauders hated horses ) , he was the creator of a folk proverb : <p> " Never a bee from a mare . " <p> Joseph V. Stalin , talking about the winds of Alphonse Kauders , said : <p> " Many a time , during our Central Committee sessions , comrade Kauders would , well , cut a wind , and a few moments later , all comrades would be helplessly crying . Including myself , as well . " <p> Alphonse Kauders was the owner of the revolver with which Lola , a twelve-year-old Marseilles prostitute , was shot . <p> Ivo Andrich , talking about Alphonse Kauders , in the course of time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a secret operation . All that remained was a sheath of skin within which he safely dreamt of a bibliography of pornographic literature . " <p> Alphonse Kauders spent the night between April 5th and April 6th , 1941 , on the top of Avala , waiting to see Belgrade burning . <p> Alphonse Kauders killed his dog Rex with gas after Rex had tried to slaughter him while sleeping because Alphonse Kauders had set mouse traps all over the place to revenge himself on Rex for having pissed on his uniform . <p> Alphonse Kauders , in the course of time , had been engaged in painting . The only painting that has been preserved , oil on canvas , is called The Class Roots of Tattooing and is kept in the National Museum in Helsinki . <p> Alphonse Kauders , in the course of time , said to Josip B. Tito : <p> " A few days , or years , hell , ago I noticed that a tree under the window of one of my seven rooms had grown some ten goddamn meters . There are n't many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who do are most often lumberjacks . " <p> Gavrilo Princip , talking about the winds of Alphonse Kauders , had said : <p> " They sounded like this : **27;98;TOOLONG . " <p> Alphonse Kauders had had two legal sons and two legal daughters . The rest were illegal . One son had been shot as a war criminal in Kaunas , Lithuania ; the other had been a distinguished member of the Australian national croquet team . One daughter had been an interpreter at the Yalta conference ; the other had discovered , in the Amazon rain forests , a then unknown species of an insect resembling the bee , named Virgo Kauders . <p> Alphonse Kauders had said : <p> " Literature has nothing human in itself . Nor in myself . " <p> Alphonse Kauders had never finished work on the bibliography of pornographic literature . <p> Notes on Kauders <p> J. B. Tito was the Yugoslav communist dictator for thirty-five years . My childhood was saturated with histories of his just enterprises . My favorite one has always been the one in which he , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pig 's head in the house pantry , hoarded for Christmas , and , without telling his brothers and sisters , gorged with it all by himself  --  an ominous act for a future communist head of a state . Afterwards , he was sick for days ( the fat overdose ) and was additionally punished by being banned from the Christmas dinner Later on he became an atheist and never lost the passion for pigs and heads . <p> Rosa Luxembourg was a German communist who attempted , with Karl Liebknecht , a socialist revolution in Germany after the end of World War I , and then withered with it . Rosa Luxembourg was a terribly nice name for a revolutionary . <p> King Alexander was a Yugoslav king and was assassinated in Marseilles , in 1934 , by a Macedonian nationalist , with the generous help of Croatian fascists . Rickety propaganda machinery of the first Yugoslavia sermoned that his last words were : " Take care of my Yugoslavia . " The likely truth was that he gobbled and bolted his own blood , while a sweaty French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alexander 's ex-body , corpse-to-be . I always thought that the fact that an Alexander was assassinated by a Macedonian was as close as you can get to a nice touch in a farce . <p> Richard Sorge was the Soviet spy close to the German diplomatic circles in Tokyo before and at the beginning of World War II He had informed Stalin that Hitler was going to attack the Motherland , but Stalin trusted Hitler and disregarded the information . The first time I read about Sorge I was twelve and , not even having reached the end of the book , decided to become a spy . At the age of eighteen . I wrote a poem about Sorge which was titled The Loneliest Man in the World . The first verse : " Tokyo is breathing and I am not . " <p> Gavrilo Princip was the young Serb who assassinated the Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand Habsburg and Sofia , his pregnant wife , thus effectively starting World War I. He was eighteen at the time and had the first scrub over his thin lip and dark ripples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which lasted only a few more years , and died of tuberculosis , blessed by repeated beatings , in an obscure Austrian prison . In Sarajevo , by the bridge that used to be called Latin , at the corner from which he sent those historical bullets into the fetus 's brain , his footprints were immortalized in concrete ( left foot W-E , right foot SE-NW ) . When I was a little boy I imagined him waiting for the Archduke 's carriage , waiting to change the course of history , stuck up to his ankles in wet concrete . When I was sixteen my feet fit perfectly into his feet 's tombs . <p> The Encyclopedia of U.S.S.R. is a book whose different editions are innumerable and often obscure . Historical characters ( like Stalin 's numerous Secret Police chiefs ) would be praised in one edition and then would be vanished in the other . There are countries whose precious minerals ( with annual production in parentheses ) would be minutely listed by the encyclopedia 's sanguine map in one edition , and in another they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without the bubble-burps ever reaching the surface of the map-world . This great book teaches us how the verisimilitude of fiction could be achieved by the exactness <p> The Encyclopedia of Yugoslavia , on the other hand , was never even close to being entirely published , so there really is n't any encyclopedic Yugoslavia , which , by a brute turn of history , could n't matter less , since there 's hardly any Yugoslavia . <p> Bukharin was a high Party official and probably the main Soviet ideologist ( save great Stalin ) in the thirties , for which he was awarded with an accusation of spying , simultaneously , for the United States , Great Britain , France and Germany . No one was surprised but every one was terrified when he was sentenced to death , for that was the beginning of one of Stalin 's greatest purges . From his death cell he sent a letter to Stalin , beginning with words : " Koba , why did you need my death ? " He voluntarily cooperated with his inquisitors and refused to be used as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a Dantesque inferno , he 'll eternally bang his porcine head against the walls of hell 's pantry . <p> Ivo Andrich was the only Yugoslav author that has ever been awarded the Nobel Prize . In 1941 , he worked in the Yugoslav embassy in Berlin , and helped organize trysts of cringing Yugoslav politicians with Hitler . He was a gentleman and wrote novels about the ways people are entangled with history . At the acceptance ceremony he talked about the importance of bridges . In his youth , he was involved in organizing the Archduke 's assassination . <p> On April 6th , 1941 , at dawn , Belgrade was relentlessly bombed by the Luftwaffe . That was the beginning of the German attack on the Kingdom of Yugoslavia , which lasted for eleven more days . <p> Avala is a breastlike mountain by Belgrade , with the tomb-tumor for the Unknown Soldier , built after World War I. <p> The Yalta Conference brought together Churchill , Roosevelt and Stalin . The end of the war was near and they were victors ( " I 'd like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw a photo of those three great men in Yalta , sitting in three wicker chairs , against the background of standing people whose names were as insignificant as their deeds . The three heads of the world had something like a dim grin on their rotund faces , as though they had done a good , hard job ( " Have some Germany " ) . When I was thirteen , I thought that the picture was taken right after their lunch , because , as my father claimed , right after lunch is the best time , for people are " full and happy . " I thought that behind their dim grins they were trying to get out Last trifles of food from between their teeth . They gaze at me , full of borscht , Crimean wine and plans for the world . Within a few moments Churchill will be asleep , and I 'll be old , lacking significance , but not memories . <p> Now read the story again . <p>               @ @ @ @ @ @
