DANIAL DANZER KNEW HE WAS DYING of AIDS . Of all the fears he faced , losing his mind was the worst . When his faculties started to fade , he wanted to hasten his death . But his doctor could not help ; Washington State law prohibited physicians from assisting the terminally ill in committing suicide . So Danzer stopped taking his insulin . After five days of convulsions , he finally died . Says his partner , Jeff Halsey : " He might have been spared some of his greatest pain and retained some of his dignity if he and his physician had received help from a compassionate code of laws .

" <P> The decision , the first by a federal appeals court on assisted suicide , dramatically extends the right to die . " It advances it not by steps but by leaps , " observes law professor Alan Meisel of the University of Pittsburgh . While previous decisions , most notably the Supreme Court 's in the 1990 Cruzan case , have held that terminally ill patients can refuse medical treatment , the new ruling declares that they also have a right to seek assistance in dying from doctors  --  and pharmacists and family members . <P> Last week 's ruling is expected to have an impact beyond the Ninth Circuit 's nine-state jurisdiction . At least 33 states have laws forbidding assisted suicide , and many of them are under challenge . Clearly the decision is in tune with public opinion . Two days after it was issued , a Michigan jury in the second assisted-suicide trial of Dr. Jack Kevorkian reached the same verdict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P>  --  By Anastasia Toufexis .
