silence , darkness . lights up slowly to reveal a young man , early 30s , dressed in a plain suit . he is seated on the edge of a hotel chair and nurses a water glass in one hand .

I guess the point i 'm making is that it 's a stress-filled situation i 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complaining , i just wanted to , i do n't know , lead in the right way on this . i 'm not making excuses , i 'm not ( BEAT ) looks like i 'm losing you . las vegas . is n't that far frommust be getting late . i 'll try and bebrief  --  things took a bit of a turn for us last year . well , i guess about two years ago , now . my wife and me , the family , you knowwe lost a child , newborn , well , five months old , just like that . just happened . ( BEAT ) i was off that day , a friday , i think , and deborah , that 's my wife , deb , she was out  --  her mother was staying with us , and they were over at safeway getting some milk  --  deb put the baby down , " emma " we 'd named her , she put emma in our bed because that 's where she 'd been sleeping the first few monthswe always thought that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or she heard it at church or something like thatanyway , so that 's what she did . she tucks her in , and out they went . and see , i was gon na lie down with her , i really was , but i just went back into the living room for a second , watch a little wheel of fortune or some thing , you know , five minutes a week to myself , and i fell . fell off to sleep right there , there on the loveseat by the window . ( BEAT ) deb 's momemma 's grandma found her . maybe a half hour later , she 'd smothered herself under the covers , i do n't know , beneath the weight of the comforter or whatever it was . this big old maroon and gold thing we 'd gotten as a wedding gift , huge  --  and she 'd , well , she 'd suffocated , that 's about as plain as you can tell it , right ? the little thingdied in our bed , tangling herself in the blankets . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do for any kind of infant death , that 's what the officer said ; i 'd gotten a hold of myself by that time , still crying , but debdeb was just kind of sitting there next to me , staring off , and this guy  --  this person  --  a detective , i suppose , was asking us questions , standing there and firing off this series of questions . " standard procedure , " he assured us , but still pause.what bothered himno , " puzzled " him , he said , never came right out and said it bothered him but you could see by the way hehe did n't understand how the baby could get so far down . ( BEAT ) now i am losing you , right ? okay , yeah , i 'm getting ahead of myselfit seemed to him that the baby , a baby that young and small , she was such a small little thingwas too far down toward the foot of the bed , and turned , something about that seemed to be eating at him . i did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he kept going back and forth over the events and times and all that , " where were you standing ? " and " approximately how long were you ? " blah , blah , blah . i mean , my god , we 're sitting there on the edge of the sofa , the bed my daughter has just died in i can see through an open door back down the hallway , and this man is pacing around , sucking on the chewed cap of a ballpoint pen andasking me quietly , " did you check on her ? " ( BEAT ) what 's he getting at , anyway ? i mean , that 's a no-win , is n't it ? think about itif i did n't check on her , i 'm not a good father , not anything he can say about it , but i carry around the guilt , you knowmaybe i could 've prevented it , right ? and if i did go in there , if i had 've done what i was supposed to do , had planned on doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( BEAT ) and for just a second , just the briefest of momentsi catch deb looking over at me. as if this is the first time the thought 's come to her as well . this possibility , the whole incident hangs there  --  probably only two or three seconds all together  --  but it just lays there in the air over us all . this shadow of a doubtthere 's another clich for youit hangs there until i say , very matter-of-factly , " umm , no , i did n't , i meant to , but " and off he goes . says " fine , " stops me cold , and off he goes . onto another tangent ( BEAT ) she took my hand in hers , deb did , just after that . scooped it up into her tiny fingers and held it thereall the rest of that afternoon , even after the police were gone , as we sat there into the evening with her mother , our two other children , home from school and having heard it allnone of us talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roomshe held onto my hand . and somehow , because of that , i felt at peace ( BEAT ) anyway , the detective said that he was nearly done , just one or two more items , when deborah grabbed hold of my hand like she did . when she did that pause.all during this i can see guys passing  --  oops , i mean " people "  --  i can see these people passing in front of the doorway , i could , deb was just off to the side enough to miss it , thank heavens tweezers all out , picking up scraps of whatever , the snap ! of flashbulbs , some muffled talk about an upcoming jazz gamei 'm starting to feel queasy . the heat of the room , maybe , and the sitting there as this almost unbearable thing unfolds in front of uswe 'd hardly had a moment to hold each other , deborah and myself , to cry and , you know , just and this happens , this dragnet episode takes place right in our living roomand i start to feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but i felt it all the same pause.and finally they were gone . i looked around , and the front door slammed shut and it was empty , the house , they 'd taken emma out with them , the coroner , maybe a half hour before , wrapped in a little zip-up bag , something like what i carry my pressed shirts in when i travel , i mean , i know i said i do n't like to go out on the road , i did n't used to , anyway , butwell , just let me finish . emma was gone , and we ate dinnerwe may have even ordered out that night ; that probably sounds horrible , but deborah just could n't stand over the stove right then , so it seems like we had a pizza yeah , one from sbarro 's , over at the mall . we had pizza , deb holding my hand under the table the whole time , all through the silence and we went to bed right after . ( BEAT ) the phone woke me about 11:30. i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get it , but i was on by about the third , maybe the fourth ring . it was him . the police detective and very apologetic about calling so late , and the whole process and the usual stuff that you 'd see on any of those cop programs on tv. we do n't watch them much  --  maybe the kids do , when we 're not around , but they 're not supposed to  --  but you know the kind i mean . he was like that ( BEAT ) it 'd all come out fine , he said , ruled " natural causes " after a few tests 'd been run and he just wanted to let us know and if there was anything he could do he 'd be glad toi hung up without him finishing , he 'd put us through enough that day . on a day like that , a day no parent should ever have to face , and to have thosepeople do thatso i hung up . i hung up the receiver and rolled back over to deborah , i just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and squeezing her fingers a bit . but it woke her . she woke up and we whispered to each othertalking under the sheets like two schoolchildren , about things we had n't mentioned in years ! we were under the sheets , just them , because from that night on , deb and i could never sleep with blankets on that bed againthat 's probably odd , is n't it ? maybe notbut we couldn't. middle of winter , kids 'll all be off on ski trips and deborah and me just huddle together under the sheets , to this day ( BEAT ) anyhow , the talking must 've gone on for hours , a few at least and then the kissing and finally well , you 're not that drunk , you do n't need to hear it all . we did what you 'd imagine you might do on a night like that , a moment when your entire universe has been changed forever . ( BEAT ) i do n't know , but that may have even been the night that joe wasthat 's our youngest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and i have a brother of the same name , sobut joe came almost exactly nine months later , he 's a great boy , he really is. and over time , and with the new childlife goes on . it does , and it 's strange to say that , you know , because i 'd never believe it from hearing some other person say it , i mean . if i heard that i 'd just never buy it , because of the loss , and you know , i 'd feel everybody was just smiling and pretending to be all understanding , but they really think that you 're like some chinese family getting rid of the daughter to get a son and just crazy things 'd run through my head but then it happens to you , and it 's true . ( BEAT ) you just go on . you do . you thank your heavenly father for giving you strength to stand up to his trials and figure there must be a plan behind it all , a reason for so much pain and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we went onand more than that . a lot more ( BEAT ) lemme fill your glass there or you 're not gonnawell , okay . if you 're fine , then you 're fine . umm ( BEAT ) soso , so , so . pause. I 've gotten off the path heresomehow . ( CHECKS WATCH ) umm , look at theyou 're sure you 've got the time for this ? ( BEAT ) well , there 's not much left to tell , anyhow , so finish off that drink and i 'll be donei promise . pause.alright , ummthere was a problem , that 's what had started all this , i mean , originally , started it all in motiona problem at work . we 'd been taken over recently , i mean , no big deal in theory , happened all the time during the 80s , somebody else takes over , you lose a few of the stragglers , guys who could n't keep upand i do mean " guys " as in everybody , all people here , because it was usually women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the timetakeovers were an excellent way to get things back in order , and that 's not just me talking , you knowthere 's definitely an order to things in business , and the old boys at the top , the guys you never even see , just their pictures in the hallwaythey like things the way they 've always been . so that 's when a bunch of these women with their m.b.a.s and affirmative action nonsense would get the boot . nothing personal about it , at least i never felt there wasjust getting everything spinning back the way it was supposed to be . ( BEAT ) but not this time . no , this time it was gon na happen , and nobody could tell which way things would end up . everybody at my level ; that mid-management level of thingswas pretty vulnerable and it came down that we could count on four of us from the salt lake office being let go  --  that 's where i worked , commuted in from orem every day because of the standard of living that area afforded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to who got the axe . another cliche , right ? yeah , well , i 'm full of ' em . or it , full of it , one of the twoca n't be sure anymore . ( BEAT ) so , that was the story , four of us were going to go , three of which i and everyone else had a pretty good idea of , three that should 've gone a long time ago , but that last spotthat was the one . the tough call . there was me , who 'd been steady and strong and average , you know , just average or slightly above , someone that they could count on , good sense of humor and everything for the past seven years , well liked and i liked everyone . or , most everyone , there was this woman , a few years younger than me and had come in during a wave of new hires about four years backjust plain vicious , i mean , talk about cliches and all that , she was a walking onethe business suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever even seeing her smile , you know what i 'm saying but she knew her stuff , i knew it , we all did , and so did she and she reveled in it . the sales , the numbers , the whole game . we 'd gotten off badlyactually , i 'd made a mistake once , a board meeting where i 'd grouped her in with a " you guys ought a " meaning that side of the table and she called me out on itfirst meeting , or maybe the second , she 'd been to and she nails me out loud about my attitude , my limited " chauvinist lexicon " and all this other , just , crap that she fired off . walked out of the room in silence and me and some of the other guys laughed it off over lunch , but i caught one or two of the other women smiling to themselves as the meeting broke up . just this slight thing , but i caught itanyway , i always felt one step behind her after that , like she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment on ( BEAT ) but she was one . me , and her , because of the short time she 'd been there , and a couple other folks that had about the same seniority that i didand that 's what hung over our heads , each of us , day after day as we 'd go into work . it was coming , we knew that , it was going to happen and all we could do was look at each other as we sat there waiting pause. I got the call just before deb had gone to safeway . took it in the den because it was coming from chicagoa friend of mine , at the home office , a guy from school actually , with a tip . a tip he 'd heard that day and wanted to call me with itit was me. i was the one that would make up the four , and he was so sorry and all that  --  he 's a really good guy , i see him whenever i 'm in chicago , we were these really big jokers when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was just doing what any guy would do , he said , letting me hear it from a friendly voice , and giving me a jump , the weekend , anyway , before he hung up he said again it was just what was going around , but he thought i should know ( BEAT ) i could n't even look at deb as she was going out to the van . she called out to me , told me to crawl in and get a little snooze before the kids got home and they 'd be right backbut i just waved to her . could n't look , you know , not right then , just waved my hand , i was too busy looking around the house , at our things , i mean , all the things we 'd gathered in ten years together , and at the house itself and , well , just all of itwhat was i gon na do ? how could i possibly keep it all going , the lifestyle we 'd made for ourselves , without my seniority , the benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just would n't be possible ( BEAT ) it was like the moment in that film kramer vs. kramer , you know , where he decides he 's got to get a job that day , right ? i felt like that keep bringing up movies and tv and i do n't mean to , because we really do n't watch all that much , but there is some good programming out there , and that was an especially moving one , i thought , the way he fought that battle with his wife over the child andbut i 'm standing there , just taking in the vcr , and our big screen tv and one of the kid 's bikes , i can see through the front window , the pathfinder , wheel of fortune 's blasting on the t v. in the family roomall these thoughts are swirling around in my head . and i hear it . ( BEAT ) i was n't asleepi could n't of been , i mean , i 've tried to believe it , make myself believe it , too , but i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . the baby , emma , in the other room . as i was standing there i heard her cry out from inside the bedroom . i did ( BEAT ) when i got to the doorway she was already under the blankets , she was , i swear , under them and fighting to get out . it 's just reflexes , i guess , because she was n't big enough to do anything about it , i mean , she 'd just started to crawl a few weeks before that , and she was tiny for her age , the doctors said thatbut she 'd managed to get herself down under that comforter , i rushed in there , to the edge of the carpet at the bedroom door and then , i do n't know , something stopped me. just stopped me like some invisible force had reached out and took hold of the back of my shirt and yanked me to a halti looked in at her again , this little yelp kind of coming up from her as she blundered around in thereit almost looked like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family cat , you know , would get put under the blankets for a laugh , it was like that . almost , this littlemound wandering around in there , it was nearly absurd , to walk in on something like this , i mean , you just could never be ready for a thing like that , and because of that , that specific part of it , the unreality i was able to make the decision , in that moment , standing there watching my daughter fight for her life , i made my decision , this is very hard toanyway , remember i said i hated to waste things ? well , when i looked at it , i mean , rationally , for even half-a-second there in the hallway , i realized that 's what this was . an opportunity , and i was n't going to waste it ( BEAT ) so i  --  i 'm just gon na say this , because it 's a littleso , i went into the room and stood there by the bed , i stood there and pulled up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . her little fine sandy hair and heri just kind of coaxed her down a bit . down a bit further with the edge of my foot , turned her a touch and down and then i dropped the covers back and walked outthere was one last little sound emma made , you could barely hear it . but i just kept walking , back out to the loveseat , there in the family room , and layed down and made myself go to sleep , put a pillow over my head so i could n't hearand drifted off . ( BEAT ) the point i wan na make , though , see , is that it did n't have to happen that way . i took the risk , this calculated risk for my family that this whole episode would play out in our favor , give me that little edge at work and maybe things 'd be okay , or they 'd change their minds because of , you knowbut it did n't have to be like that . if deb had just hurried a bit , if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother had n't gone next door to fill a prescription , then who knows ? maybe they would 've got back in time and emma would still bethat sounds strange , does n't it , that way of thinking ? but all i 'm saying is , it was fate that took her , just the whimsy of a lingering red light or a prolonged chat with one of our neighbors in the produce aisle or if i had n't heard her cry out in the first place , i mean , i could 've gotten into bed there beside her , i was planning to , i might 've fallen asleep and never even heard her . thenwho knows ? it probably would 've happened anyway , and it did happen , and so you go on . like i said before , you just go on pause. I kept my job . i did . and guess who was the one , i mean , after all that , guess who got it right between the eyes ? another cliche , i know , but boy oh boy , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked her to the elevator the day she left , her and the other three , this was several months after all the otheri was right behind them with a " so long " and " we 'll miss you " and right then , it came to me , it came to me with my friends standing around and that littlewell , she was n't looking so strong anymore , there in the open car , this box of stuff in her hands , as the doors were closing i said to them all , but staring straight at her , i said , " you guys take care now ! " just like that , and then they slid shut . huhjust like in kramer at the end . the doors did ( GESTURES ) is n't that funny ? i never thought of that beforei said that and we laughed all through lunch about it , the guys and me. pause. I was at a seminar , big yearly thing the company put on . this one was in boston , six months back . my friend from chicago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning session , just in passing as we were both in the restroom at one point , he said something to me , my friend , i guess trying to lighten things up a little , he mentioned work . and about the layoffs , and how glad i must 've finally been to have gotten rid of you know who. and then he said , " boy , i really had you going that friday , did n't i ? " i turned to him , standing there at the urinal , my fly still open and i turned to him and the whole picture was clear to me. right then , it was as clear as a look into the futurewhat he 'd done . what we always used to do to each other , see , he 'd heard the real truth about what was coming and just could n't let it go without a little razzing and so he 'd given me the call , let me stew about it over that weekendhe was going to buzz me back monday morning with the truth , but by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , alright , he got me good , just like the old days . pause.so i travel now , same pay and everything , a little better actually , but i consult for our regional branches , even nationally sometimesand it keeps me going , deb and i are fine . joe 's getting huge , he really is , i 'd show you a picture but i do n't have any on mebut i find i really like the driving these days , you know ? gives me a lot of time to just well , drive , just drive and think , i usually do n't even get a room ; i got this place ( GESTURES ) because i 'm here a few days but normally , i 'd have everything in the trunk and just do it that way it 's funny how things end up , is n't it ? ( BEAT ) i ca n't tell deb , it 'd kill her . kill us , as a family , i mean , that 's obvious , right ? ca n't tell anyone in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . i saw you , tonight as i was walking through the lobby , and i just chose you . so there it is 'm finished . pause.you probably need toyeah , it 's late . take care of yourself , and thanks again , seriously , you 've been veryyou have any kids ? no ? well , when you do , you be good to them , okay ? there 's nothing like ' em in the worldbelieve me . ( BEAT ) why do n't you go ahead and shut the light off there on your way out , if you wouldi 'm just gon na sit here a bit . i 'll be fine . you go ahead , really , it 's almost time for the last call , so you shouldi 'll befine , i will . ( AFTER A MOMENT ) goodnight he smiles weakly once and takes a last sip from his glass as the lights snap off . silence , darkness .                    @
