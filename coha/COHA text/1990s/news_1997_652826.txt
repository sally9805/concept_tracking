<p> EVERYONE LOVES AMERICAN movies . Well , almost everyone . China 's effort to derail two films about the Dalai Lama , " Kundun , " directed by Martin Scorsese , and " Seven Years in Tibet , " starring Brad Pitt , suggests that Beijing was not happy about American efforts to lionize Tibet 's spiritual leader . But China is hardly alone . <p> In recent months , several American films have come under savage attack by foreign governments , religious sects , nationalist parties or outraged intellectuals and other critics who assail movies that Hollywood considers as American as apple pie . Some foreigners , it seems , hate apples or pie . And while American studios are willing to antagonize foreigners by making movies about controversial political events or figures  --  films like " Michael Collins " or " Evita "  --  they often fail to anticipate the furor stirred up by such seemingly innocent films as " Babe " and " Independence Day . " <p> " Even some of us who make movies underestimate their influence abroad , " said Irwin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and " Raging Bull . " " American movies sell American culture . Foreigners want to see American movies . But that 's also why so many foreign governments and groups object to them . " <p> Despite protests , censorship and campaigns to suppress American films , however , several of these movies have drawn record audiences and are making huge profits abroad . And it is these profits rather than moral principle that best insure Hollywood 's willingness to continue producing such films , industry experts agree . <p> Consider " Independence Day , " the American blockbuster that has taken in over $466 million worldwide . It is expected to make more money at the box office than the entire slate of films released last year by Universal , Paramount and Sony combined , according to Tom Pollock , the former chairman of MCA/Universal and the current chairman of the American Film Institute . To 20th Century Fox executives , it seemed an unobjectionable , sure-fire hit given its politically correct themes and multicultural cast of characters . In the action thriller , an affable baby boomer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ join forces with a black fighter pilot to thwart an alien invasion of earth . <p> One might think that wide-screen images of the aliens ' annihilation of the White House , Manhattan and Los Angeles in less than 15 minutes of gory celluloid would exhilarate America 's foreign enemies . But Hezbollah , the Lebanese Shiite Muslim radicals who accuse the " great Satan " of fomenting conspiracies against Arabs and Muslims throughout the Middle East , despises the film almost as much as it does America . <p> Last fall , Hezbollah , or the Party of God , issued a statement calling the film " propaganda for the so-called genius of the Jews and their alleged concern for humanity . " Warning Muslim believers to boycott the movie , which was directed by Roland Emmerich , who is not Jewish but German , Hezbollah reminded fellow Muslims that paying money to see the the film would " reward the bloodsuckers of Qana , " a reference to Israel ( which bombed Qana , a U.N . camp in Lebanon ) , and Israel 's protector , the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeps track of international sales , Hezbollah 's warning did not hurt box office revenues in Lebanon , which has an estimated four million people . Quite the contrary . Between Sept. 20 and Dec. 12 , the executive said , some 98,000 people went to see " Independence Day " in Lebanon ; the film grossed almost $600,000  --  an impressive showing for any film . By contrast , the film took in about $670,000 in Egypt , which has a population of 60 million . The only other Middle Eastern country in which the film fared better than in Lebanon was Israel , where it grossed $4.7 million . <p> Moreover , not a single violent incident was reported during the film 's 12-week run in Lebanon or anyplace else in the Middle East , the executive said . In fact , several of the film 's leading actors , including Jeff Goldblum , who plays the computer scientist , were unaware that Hezbollah had issued its political version of a fatwa , a religious ruling , against the film . <p> " I respect anyone 's religion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think Hezbollah has missed the point : the film is not about American Jews saving the world ; it 's about teamwork among people of different religions and nationalities to defeat a common enemy . " Hezbollah 's anti-Jewish crusade , he added , " does not sit well with me . " <p> The film whose politics seemed so innocuous to its American producers , however , did not sit well with Lebanon 's censors either . Before it was released in Beirut , the Interior Ministry 's Public Security Department eliminated several scenes . The censors cut one in which Judd Hirsch , who plays Mr. Goldblum 's gemutlich , Yiddish-spouting father , puts on a yarmulke as he leads White House officials and soldiers in a Hebrew prayer ; another showed Israeli troops alongside Arab soldiers as they prepared to fight the aliens . <p> Although Fox has not distributed the videocassette of the film in Lebanon , journalists there said that pirated cassettes were also selling briskly in Beirut . Cassettes are also in demand in Teheran , whose austere Islamic regime bans most American-made movies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ video clubs in Iran , where " Baywatch , " incidentally , is quite popular . Banning films in such authoritarian states , like banning books in Boston , is great for business . An Irish Hero <p> Another American-financed political film that has generated fierce debate in Ireland and Britain is " Michael Collins , " directed by Neil Jordan , an Irishman . The film chronicles the life and death at age 31 of the man who masterminded the ruthless Irish Republican Army campaign to break Britain 's hold over its obstreperous colony . Since its release last fall , the film has spent several weeks as No. 1 at the box office in Ireland . But less predictably , it is also doing well in England , where films with Irish nationalist themes usually do poorly . <p> Attacks have come from prominent British and Irish critics alike , among them Eoghan Harris , an Irish political columnist and screenwriter who , in the pages of Rupert Murdoch 's conservative Irish edition of The Sunday Times , called Mr. Jordan 's chronicle of the man widely regarded as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morals and bad art . " <p> " If our media and academics were not so numbed by nationalism , they would see the movie is racist , " Mr. Harris wrote in November in one of his many attacks . The film 's unmistakable political message , he added , was that all Brits were bad . <p> Critics warned that the film might complicate efforts to renew the 1994 cease-fire in Northern Ireland , which broke down last year just as several films with I.R.A . themes were about to be released . Others warned that painting Collins as a hero might encourage greater intransigence on the part of Gerry Adams , the leader of Sinn Fein , the political wing of the I.R.A . It was an I.R.A . faction that ended the cease-fire that had brought Northern Ireland two years of calm . <p> The staunchly unionist London Daily Telegraph demanded last fall that the film 's distributor , Warner Brothers , withdraw " Michael Collins . " Warner refused , of course . <p> Even critics now concede that " Michael Collins " has not become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently changed many minds in either country . <p> Unlike Americans , Irish and English audiences have flocked to the film . The film has grossed just under $10 million in the United States , a lackluster performance given a cast headed by Liam Neeson and Julia Roberts . Perhaps the movie fared poorly in America because , as noted by Michael Dwyer , a journalist with The Irish Times , it portrayed what James Joyce called " our dear , dirty Dublin , " rather than the " stereotypical images that Americans , Irish-Americans in particular , lap up  --  the folksy , quaint Ireland with people singing , dancing , and drinking a lot . " <p> By contrast , the film has so far made $4.8 million in England and $5.9 million in Ireland , surpassing " Jurassic Park " as the most popular film ever released there . " There is no doubt that the controversy generated interest , " said Nancy Carson , director of Warner 's International Theatrical Distribution . <p> The film 's popularity with British audiences is more difficult to understand . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he called a " sadomasochistic streak " in the British , who increasingly relish " guilt trips " about England 's colonial history . But Stephen Woolley , the film 's producer , said it reflected a healthy desire among the British to learn about , and come to grips with , their past . <p> An Argentine Saint <p> Several American movies that touch on sensitive political themes have been attacked well before they opened . One of those is " Evita , " starring Madonna , the movie version of Andrew Lloyd Webber 's hit musical . Directed by Alan Parker , who is English , with a budget of more than $60 million , the film has caused a bitter debate in Argentina over whether the Material Girl is fit to play Eva Peron , the wife of Gen. Juan Domingo Peron , the populist strongman who dominated Argentine politics for nearly three decades . Eva Peron is , even in death , a national figure whom much of the nation adores . Opening on Christmas Day to mixed reviews in the United States , " Evita " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Argentina , attracting huge audiences and angry debate when it opens next month . <p> Meanwhile , a local , more patriotic film version of the saga , " Eva Peron , " has already become a domestic " box office sensation , " according to Variety . Starring Esther Goris , a popular actress in Argentina , as Evita , the film skims over the more scandalous aspects of the First Lady 's rise to power , concentrating instead on the last two years before her death , in 1952 . Opening in Argentina on Oct. 24 , partly to pre-empt Mr. Parker 's extravaganza , the film drew an impressive 90,000 viewers in its opening week . It has been selected as Argentina 's entry for the Oscar for best foreign-language film and has already earned $300,000 in its first two months , according to Maria de la Paz Marino , the executive producer . <p> Ms. Marino said that although she had not yet seen the American film , Argentina owed the " Evita " film makers gratitude . " Now everyone in the world knows Evita , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Other Argentines have not been as charitable . When " Evita " was being filmed on location in Buenos Aires last January , hard-line Peronistas greeted Madonna with placards and graffiti that read : " Evita Lives ! Madonna Out ! " Several Congressional representatives presented resolutions calling for Madonna and Mr. Parker to be declared persona non grata . President Carlos Saul Menem , a Peronist , even told local newspapers that the musical was " a libelous interpretation of Evita 's life , " and that Madonna was " unsuitable " for the role . While Madonna tried to woo Argentine public opinion in an interview with a local gossip magazine , much of the good will she generated evaporated in November when , in diary excerpts published in Vanity Fair magazine , she called Argentina an " uncivilized " country with " no gyms and no decent food . " Nor was President Menem thrilled , according to the Argentine press , by Madonna 's description of him as a " charming " leader with " small feet " who " dyes his hair black " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sacred Cows <p> Jack Valenti , president of the Motion Picture Association of America , said that controversy over political films was nothing new . President Charles de Gaulle of France , he noted , had banned " Paths of Glory , " an American classic about a World War I mutiny within a French Army unit , starring Kirk Douglas and directed by Stanley Kubrick . " The King and I , " the 1956 film rendition of the musical starring Yul Brynner and Deborah Kerr , has never been shown in Thailand , which is allergic to criticism of its kings . More recently , the military rulers of Myanmar , formerly known as Burma , succeeded in banning John Boorman 's " Beyond Rangoon , " which highlights the courage of the dissident and Nobel Prize winner Daw Aung San Suu Kyi . <p> In some movies , American film makers have intentionally taken political sides , hoping to rally public support for or against a cause and knowing that their work will be banned abroad . For instance , Hollywood promoted the pro-Israeli film " Exodus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a long time before American directors cast an American film hero as Yasir Arafat or Fidel Castro . <p> Mr. Pollock , of the film institute in Los Angeles , said that the attacks had to be seen in their cultural context . Virtually every country except the United States censors films , he said . " England did not release ' Natural Born Killers ' for six months because of concern about the film 's violence , " he said , referring to Oliver Stone 's critically acclaimed but controversial film about a pair of maniacal lovebirds who become celebrities through their mass murders . " Germany , too , has become increasingly opposed to violence in films . " <p> Asian nations censor less for violence than they do for sexually offensive material , particularly films with substantial nudity , Mr. Pollock said . Other states censor to protect religious sensitivities . Muslim Asian nations were particularly uncomfortable with American films deemed disparaging to Islam . In " True Lies , " the popular Arnold Schwarzenegger thriller , for example , the director James Cameron agreed to turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also changed the name of the group to avoid the impression that the terrorists were conducting a jihad , an Islamic holy war . <p> " There is nothing wrong with being sensitive to other nations ' concerns and sensitivities , " Mr. Pollock said . <p> Governments often cite religious or cultural objections to a film , however , as pretexts for their political discomfort . " It is ludicrous to believe that Egypt or other Arab countries banned ' Schindler 's List ' because of its presumed salacious content and sexual thrill , " said Annette Insdorf , director of undergraduate film studies at Columbia University , referring to Steven Spielberg 's film about the Holocaust , which won the Academy Award for best picture . " They banned it because they feared it would evoke sympathy for Israel . " <p> Sensitivity , moreover , is sometimes carried to ludicrous extremes , blind-siding American film makers . No one at Universal , said Mr. Pollock , could have predicted that " Babe , " the family movie that featured a lovable talking pig , would initially be banned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Some American film makers fear that as foreign revenues become increasingly important to overall profitability  --  for major American studio films last year , they exceeded gross domestic revenues , Variety reported  --  concern about offending local audiences will grow . <p> But that seems unlikely as long as the foreign box office responds positively to controversy . " I have not seen any shrinkage of willingness by American film makers to make films on controversial topics or to succumb to those pressures , " Mr. Valenti said . " That 's reassuring . "
