O.K. , so Microsoft lost the first round , big time . Assuming the two sides do n't settle out of court , it will fall to Judge Jackson to impose punishment  --  and that could be anything from a $1 fine to a cataclysmic breakup . DOJ lawyers have n't decided which remedy to recommend , but it will probably be one of the following : <P>  --  By Chris Taylor <P> Microsoft Without Windows <P> Force Microsoft to spill its most treasured possession , the source code for Windows . This might be offered by auction to other companies , which could then go out and sell their own versions . Or the code could simply be declared public property and given away . <P> WHO WINS ? Open-source advocates , who say all operating-system source codes should be freely available ( as Linux 's is ) . The public might benefit if competition led to innovation . It could be harmed if software became even more confusing than it already is . <P> Unleash The Baby Bills <P> Cut the company vertically , into two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sell the full range of Microsoft software . Indistinguishable clones would probably end up confusing the marketplace . And given Microsoft 's long history of corporate acquisitiveness , how long would it take for one of the Baby Bills to swallow up the others ? <P> WHO WINS ? Whichever company gets Bill . Also Linux , Apple OS and any other competing operating system  --  if consumers sour on Windows PCs . <P> Carve It Into Little Pieces <P> Cut the company along neater lines so that one Baby Bill markets Windows , the next sells office software , etc . A recent reorganization of Microsoft 's internal divisions makes this option more difficult than it once would have been . <P> WHO WINS ? Whichever company gets Windows , whose monopoly of the operating-systems market is what Microsoft has been leveraging all along . America Online might also benefit , if Windows loses Explorer and AOL-owned Netscape takes over the Web-browser market . <P> Tie It Up In Red Tape <P> Make Microsoft promise not to do it again by signing agreements to separate its operating system ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to sell Windows to all computermakers at the same price regardless of their relationship with Microsoft . This is the least dramatic remedy and the most likely to survive legal challenges . <P> WHO WINS ? Microsoft . Critics point out that this is precisely what the Justice Department tried to do with the 1994 consent decree , and look how much good that did . <P> WHAT IT MAY MEAN FOR YOU <P> If you are a Microsoft stockholder , you might be in for a pleasant surprise after a period of bumps and sags ( see Personal Time : Your Money ) . If you use Windows or other Microsoft programs or visit Microsoft 's popular websites , not much is likely to change in the near term  --  at least until the appeals are exhausted . What happens in the long term  --  to both the stock and the products  --  is anybody 's guess .
