To do it , begin on your forearms and knees , elbows under your shoulders and knees hip-width apart , toes curled under . Pull shoulder blades down and together and contract abs . Keeping your upper body supported on your forearms , slide your feet back while straightening your legs so that your body forms a straight line from head to heels .

To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( pointed slightly in ) in front of right ( pointed slightly out , heel lifted to allow for pivoting ) . Keep elbows bent close to your sides , fists under your chin . To jab , push off with your right foot , rotating hips to the right and bringing left shoulder inward ; then quickly extend left arm in front of you at chin height , palm down A. Pull arm back quickly . To cross , reverse the jab B. ALSO TRY . Kickboxing , Pilates , rock climbing , sports-conditioning drills , paddling , weight training , yoga . GOAL 3 : Improved Muscle Strength and Tone The old way : Isolation exercises by body part The new way : Functional , multi-muscle or compound exercises You can certainly build muscles by isolating them one at a time , but why work harder ( and longer ) than you have to ? Compound exercises recruit several muscles at once .

GOAL 4 : Increased Flexibility Photograph Photograph Photograph Photograph // The old way : Static stretching The new way : Active stretching Once upon a time there was the static stretch , which you held - and held - and held . Modernday Gumbys prefer to stretch " actively " by contracting the muscle opposing the one they 're trying to stretch . This allows the isolated muscle to relax and elongate even more . You move continuously for each of 10 reps , increasing the range of motion with each rep as your muscle releases . While you can stretch every muscle this way , a good place to start is with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knee bent and left foot on the ground , right knee pulled into chest . Slowly straighten right leg by contracting quadriceps , pressing your right heel toward the sky . Hold for 2 seconds ; then release and complete 10 reps . Next , extend right leg out straight on the ground , toes up . Contracting quads , lift right leg as close as possible to perpendicular to the ground , in line with your hip . Clasp hands behind thigh for support . Hold for 2 seconds ; then release to the ground and complete reps before repeating both stretches with your left leg . ALSO TRY : Ballet , dance , in-line skating , kickboxing , Pilates , rock climbing/bouldering , tai chi , yoga . GOAL 5 : Lean Legs and a Firm Butt The old way : Leg lifts The new way : Sports-conditioning drills Have you ever seen a flabby , out-of-shape serious athlete ? Neither have we . Makes sense , then , that sports-conditioning drills not only prep you to play , but leave you with stronger , leaner limbs as part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your southern hemisphere , try the power-supplying Hop Jump : Stand with feet together , hop right , landing flat-footed and balancing briefly before hopping back left . Do 12-15 slow hops ; then pick up the pace . This time , quickly hop left and back right ; then jump up to the center as high as you can . Repeat the hop-jump sequence 10-12 times . ALSO TRY : Ball sports , ballet , hiking , kickboxing , Pilates , skating , step aerobics , running , walking . GOAL 6 : Enhanced Cardiovascular Stamina The old way : Running , stair climbing The new way : Dancing Across the country , salsa is hot , swing rocks and everybody , in some form or another , seems to be shaking her groove thing . Talk about accidental fitness : Move continuously and vigorously for at least 30 minutes , and you can burn as many calories ( up to 200 for a 140-pound woman ) as on a ho-hum piece of cardio equipment . If your gym does n't offer boogie-type classes , check your local paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lindy Hop ( aka " cardio swing " ) , Latin groove and salsa . If you 're home , just crank up some tunes and move to the beat of your own inner drummer ( you might want to pull the shades first ) . ALSO TRY : Aerobics , hiking , kickboxing , skating , snow sports , sports-conditioning drills . Dieting Train for an event or activity always combining strength and cardio workouts Judging from the results of our most recent reader poll , the typical Shape reader has already learned a valuable lesson : Dieting to lose weight rarely produces lasting results . However , orking out to achieve a fitness goal is practically a guaranteed formula for weight-loss success . Research shows that a consistent weekly combination of cardiovascular exercise and resistance training will maintain weight loss . For cardio : Do any activity that gets your heart pumping 4-5 days a week for 30 minutes to an hour . To really stoke your metabolism , incorporate intervals into two of these workouts . ( For instance , alternate 30-second sprints with 1-minute jogs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight-training sessions on 2 separate days each week . Or , divide your workout by body parts and train 4 days per week . For each exercise , be sure to choose a weight that allows you to perform 2-3 sets of 8-12 reps . ( See " Your Ultimate Body " for Ideas . ) To avoid hitting a workout plateau , keep your muscles surprised and exercise often , changing your exercises and intensity level . ALSO TRY : Weight training paired with anything aerobic : cycling , dance , hiking , kickboxing , running , skating , walking .
