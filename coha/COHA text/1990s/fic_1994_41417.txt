Late afternoon on Ethan 's veranda , sipping the last of the Glenfiddich out of jelly glasses , the brothers attempt to numb themselves in lieu of recovery . It 's September dog days , ninety degrees in the shade , and they 're slumped in their chairs , sweat-soaked , as if they 've just finished mowing the grass . Knee-high weeds in the yard , filled with the ticking of insects , sound like they 're frying . <p> Ethan sniffs one sleeve of his T-shirt . It still smells like the hospital : bland trapped air recirculated over sickbeds and floral arrangements . Breathe it long enough , he thinks , and you 'd probably come down with Legionnaire 's disease . <p> " Seriously , " his brother Max is saying . " All the bureaucracy aside , the vermin , the pathetic pay  --  I honestly dig the Peace Corps , I 'm going straight back when all this is over . I may sign up for life . " He drapes one hand over his heart , as if reciting the Pledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he says . <p> Max is Ethan 's youngest brother  --  he 's thirty-eight . " O , Endangered One , " his fellow Peace Corps volunteers call him . Most of them are fresh out of college . Max is home from Honduras on emergency leave because their father is dying from acute leukemia . <p> Five weeks earlier , when Dr. Reynolds had been admitted to the hospital , he 'd refused a wheelchair at the emergency room entrance . Ethan , toting his suitcase , had needed to double his pace to keep up with his father 's confident , rangy stride . At the nurses ' station on the oncology wing , Dr. Reynolds had spoken with everyone . His face was open and bright and boyish . There comes , with chemotherapy , a flattering pinkness in the skin , a zesty plumpness . Yet what Ethan noted in his father was the luminosity of goodwill . It was genuine and unkillable . " How 'd your dad get along with his prostate surgery ? " he asked one nurse . He listened to everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes so profoundly clear and tender that Ethan could not bear to watch . <p> " What 's a nice fella like you doing in a place like this ? " another doctor had joked in passing , cuffing him on the neck , and Ethan 's father had grinned and shrugged in a sheepish , mock-disgruntled way while a shapely young nurse had tethered his wrist with an I.D . bracelet and hastened him off to his room . <p> He 'd never seemed to know what he was doing in a place like that except getting better . The nurses doted on him , and it was reported to Ethan 's mother that the oncologist had wept when he read the worsening lab reports . Dr. Reynolds never complained about any phase of his treatment except that , as his disease progressed , he refused to wear an oxygen mask because it inhibited talk . <p> All day Ethan and Max have been at the hospital , but now they are supposed to be grabbing dinner and picking up a sandwich to take back to their mother . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't eat a bite . But they have n't gotten around to buying dinner yet because of the altercation with a jogger on their drive home . It unnerved them . " Chill it , jerk-off , " the jogger had snarled at Ethan . So maybe that 's what he 's doing now : knocking back scotch on his veranda , chilling it despite the heat . <p> " Honduras is cowboy country , " Max says . " Your typical man struts around town with either a gun or a machete strapped to his leg . " <p> " I could use a machete , " Ethan says . " Think a machete would have impressed that jogger ? " <p> Max laughs . " If you 'd really like to get even , try mailing her to Honduras . I guarantee she wo n't arrive in one piece . I have a friend who needed a new pair of Nikes and instructed her parents to mail her one shoe at a time . " <p> Ethan excuses himself to go inside and check his answering machine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student might have called , who knows ? He directs the freshman writing program at the university , and it 's registration week , the kind of hell breaking loose on campus that 's got no respect for anybody 's personal travail . Although that 's probably the essence of hell : no privacy . The single message is from his estranged wife , Lallie : " Ethan , I 'm still at Kitty Hawk and we 're camping . I 'm in a phone booth  --  it 's the only one on the whole island . So you ca n't reach me , I 'm sorry , that 's how it is . Anyway , do you think you could leave a message on the tape , like , saying he 's died when it happens ? Otherwise I 'll just have to keep phoning and trying to catch you when I can . Tell Max hello . Better not mix booze with those antidepressants you 're taking . Dorothy Kilgallen died that way . " <p> Perversely he replays the tape , imagining he can hear the thrum of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she 's actually calling from a phone booth . He pictures her wearing a bikini , tanned , freckled with sweat , her sherry-colored hair lifted and twirled on top of her head the way she likes to wear it when the weather 's hot-like a softserve ice cream . There 's this little salty mole on the nape of her neck that he used to kiss . This is nuts , he thinks , and erases the tape . <p> He shuffles into the kitchen and opens the fridge  --  not because he 's thinking of food , just of watering his scotch down with some ice . All four ice trays are empty because he ca n't remember to fill them . About the only food in the refrigerator is cat food : six opened cans , most of them full and crusty . There are four eggs in the egg caddy , and he is thinking that he might be able to stomach an omelette , but when he tries to . lift them out they 're glued in their little sockets , having been cracked and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a carton of soured milk , a jar of Polski-wyrobs , and a casserole one of the casserole ladies from his mother 's church circle brought over when his father went into the hospital . The casserole has grown enough penicillin to save an entire Honduran village from pneumonia . <p> In a cabinet above the sink , he locates aspirin  --  St. Joseph 's baby aspirin . Not that there have ever been any babies in this house : Lallie just always had a taste for St. Joseph 's . He finds himself melting eight of the little tablets in a tablespoon of water just like she used to do and then swallowing the medicine serenely , relishing its orangeade pungency . God , what if it turns out that he 's one of those men who ca n't live without a woman ? <p> The altercation with the jogger has given him the headache . It ought to have been his father 's day-long deterioration , but for the moment he 's shirking his duty in the grief department , bearing up right now , because losing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these hands at the hospital still managing to hold onto something . You can take a cigarette break downstairs in the lobby and come back to hold a hand that is as airy as a bird 's wing , yet warm , filled with more fight than blood . You can take out the bottle of Keri lotion and anoint feet , massage toes that are as sharp and thin as the tines of a fork , but still capable of a movement indicating gratitude . Then , if it gets to be too much , you can dart down to the nurses ' station , swill a cup of coffee , and when you return to the room it 's still going on , running on empty but endlessly running : his father 's big unthwarted heart . <p> He and Max left the hospital around five o'clock , en route to Ethan 's house to get money for food . They 'd been sitting by their father 's bed since seven this morning , shortly after the oncologist phoned Ethan to say that the pneumocystis was worsening and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The weird part was that they were still pumping in the chemo . " It may seem like spitting into the ocean , " the oncologist , an old family friend , told them . " But do you know something ? I feel like spitting . " <p> In the hospital parking lot there was a stainless-steel , clanging color to the world , a kind of skating-rink clamor , and Ethan found himself squinting and holding his hands over his ears as he ambled toward his car . His brain , drugged by the long day 's dimness , felt suddenly commanded to ignite , snapping against the surface of things like a match head . " Where did I park ? " he asked Max . They walked around looking for the car for fifteen minutes . <p> You can get into a car and just blip out and still arrive safely at your destination . One part of your brain is doing the automatic , technical things that a responsible adult is capable of doing while the other part of your brain goes to sleep somehow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elm Street . Only he was also managing to smoke a hump  --  what Max calls Camels  --  and he was listening to the radio pretty intently because the jazz station was playing a wispy Astrude Gilberto song , and Lallie used to sing " Girl from Ipanema " just that way : like , if feathers could sing . Once , in the early days of their marriage , he and Lallie spent an entire summer at Wrightsville Beach . She waited tables and he sponged shamelessly off her while laboring to write a sheaf of poems he never published . A strange cat took up with them that summer , a wanton , pregnant cat who one afternoon deposited a litter of stillborn kittens in Lallie 's beach bag , and , when they discovered her , sat blinking up at them with this mordant expression , as if to say , Well , what do I do now ? They tried to take the cat home with them when the summer was . over , but she went wild in the car , clawed through the cardboard transport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pissed in their laps , would not be subdued . Eventually they let her out on the side of the highway and drove on , grief-stricken about dumping her . Ten miles down the road , they turned back to try to recover her , but could n't , and even many years later they occasionally lamented their lack of imagination in dealing with her fury . <p> He was remembering Lallie 's coy rendition of " Girl from Ipanema " and how that summer she 'd gone barefoot everywhere  --  the movies , the grocery store . Tall and tan and young and lovely . He could see her lifting the cat on its hind legs , holding its forepaws and making it bossa nova along , ventriloquizing the song in a vampish , mewling way , the way she imagined the cat would sing . And he was recalling this inanity , vividly , hypnotized by it , when he almost hit the jogger . <p> Actually he saw her . She was poised at the intersection of Elm and South Park Drive , jogging in place the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going to make a right or a left . When he failed to signal , she sprang from the curb into his path . Max grabbed his arm , but by that time he 'd already braked violently , slinging both of them forward , and the jogger had bounded back onto the sidewalk , beet-faced , arms akimbo , still jogging in place . " Goddamn it ! " she shouted at Ethan , " Goddamn it ! " she kept calling . " Last time I checked , pedestrians still had the right-of-way in this town . " <p> Her jaw was hacking at a wad of gum . She had on a black spandex halter top and neon-pink shorts , a tiny black headset and the sort of running shoes that were probably the . equivalent of wearing Maseratis on your feet . She was tall and tan and young and lovely , and she had the bronze sangfroid of an athletic trophy . " Son of a bitch , " the jogger said . <p> Ethan glared at her . He was trembling . He 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth was bleeding . " You go to hell , " he said , then goosed the car past her and down South Park to Simpson . <p> " She gave you the finger , " Max informed him . <p> Two blocks up Ethan swerved into the driveway behind a row of condominiums and parked next to a dumpster . <p> " What are you doing ? " Max asked . <p> " I do n't know , " Ethan said . " Give me a hump . " <p> Max handed him the cigarette and lit a match . <p> " Maybe I ought to beat her up , for starters , " Ethan said . <p> Max laughed and lit a cigarette for himself as well as Ethan . <p> " God , I almost killed her . Just look how my hands are shaking . Did I really tell her to go to hell ? I could break bones with these suckers . " <p> " Oops , " Max said to him , " we 've got company . " <p> In the rearview mirror , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was rolling , her hair fanned out like a lion 's mane . She did n't slacken her pace until she reached Ethan 's side of the car ; then she began to jog in place . Oh come on , Ethan thought . <p> " Look , sweetheart , " she said , but her voice was shaky . " I 'd a whole lot rather you cuss me than mow me down , but you know you straight out broke the law back there , do n't you , sweetheart ? Tell me you know that . " She leaned forward and sniffed . " Yes , " she said with a lilt of triumph , " I believe I smell liquor on your breath . " <p> " You smell cigarettes , " Max said . <p> Ethan only looked at her . She had the most perfectly shaped and well-tended body he 'd ever observed up close . Her breasts bounced up and down , mere inches from his face . He could see her nipples spiking through the spandex . But there was not a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman , as he remembered women , standing before him . All he could think of , listening to her harangue , was a line from the Yeats poem he taught in freshman English : " A terrible beauty is born . " <p> " Well , " the jogger said . " I 'm waiting . " <p> " Waiting for what ? " Max said . <p> " He knows what for , " the jogger said to Ethan . " Do n't you , sweetheart ? " In one light she looked fierce and beautiful , but in another light she looked jumpy and insane . <p> " I resent you calling him ' sweetheart , ' " Max told her . " It 's offensive . It 's weirdo sexist , that 's what it is . " <p> The woman threw back her head and laughed , but there was strain in her face , and the rivulets of perspiration running down her cheeks might just as well have been tears . Her teeth were perfectly white , and her skin was taut like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't she ? <p> She made a loop around the car . " Okay , " she said to Ethan . " I 've got your license number . You know what all this is really about , do n't you ? It 's about knowing what 's right and what 's wrong , " she said . " Like it takes a real man to say he 's sorry . " <p> " Only to a real woman , " Max said . <p> " He probably would n't know one if he saw one , " the jogger said . Then she turned and loped down the driveway towards the park . " Chill it , jerk-off , " she called over her shoulder . <p> " Jesus , " Max said , lighting another Camel . " Get me. back to Honduras , where the men are men and the women are Chiquita Banana . " <p> Both of them smoked for a while . " Joggers hate smokers , " Max said . <p> " They 'd like to rip our lungs out . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Why did n't I ? That 's what she was waiting for . " <p> " It 's all one gender in this country now , " Max said . " I 'll bet that woman was hung to her knees . " <p> Ethan gazed into the rearview mirror , but the jogger had vanished . " I 'm sorry , " he said anyway . <p> Ethan 's affair with Mary Palomino ended in April , so long ago now that he 's come to think of it as a dalliance . But standing at the kitchen sink , surveying the bleak pileup of dishes , noting the ammoniac scent rising from the mouldering laundry basket , he feels unclean and haphazard , the way the affair made him feel , right from the start . It is as if the affair with Mary Palomino has left germs that have seeded themselves in inanimate things , and Ethan is in constant danger of recontaminating himself . The disarray of his physical world seems evidence of a crime , if not still in progress , then , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dismal shrine to his moral slippage , some utterly incriminating Exhibit A. <p> Mary Palomino had worked as a secretary in the English department . She was short and broad-hipped , a vase-shaped woman , swarthy and brown-eyed . You noticed her mouth : plush , mobile , brightly-colored lips that made Ethan think of a poppy . She was twenty-three , more overgrown girl than woman , plump rather than voluptuous . She was a Texan , the daughter of Mexican migrant workers . Ambitious for an education , which she had engineered through a series of lucrative scholarships , she 'd landed at the university and enrolled in a premed curriculum . <p> Ethan was smitten with her history , her struggle and pluck . But from the beginning , the intensity of his feelings for her was undermined by their differences  --  the disparities of age and culture and race . There was something incongruous about her that made her seem ultimately contraband . He was n't in this thing for real , he sometimes told himself , which compounded his deceit and made their meetings all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the fall , and in April Mary decided to bail out . She 'd thought she could be modern , but she could not . She felt nervous and weepy all the time . Her grades were down . She was tired of skulking around , she said . He was such a damn American , she told him angrily . <p> " What sort of crap is that ? " he protested . " What do you think you are ? " <p> " You 're such an innocent , " Mary said . " I 'll admit it 's what attracted me to you . " <p> " Are you talking about some age or race thing ? " <p> " I 'm talking about the difference between somebody who was born a member of the club and somebody who has always had her nose pressed to the window , looking in . " <p> " I 've never thought of you that way . " <p> " Look , " she said , " if I were to go totally naked on you , you would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 'd dump me out with the trash . " <p> " That 's crazy , Mary . " <p> " In the beginning , I felt so crazy being with you that I could trash myself and laugh about it . I felt like a rich girl . When you 're feeling top dog inane like that , you always think there 's more of you to waste . " <p> " Waste ? What are you talking about " <p> " Spoken like a true gringo . " <p> " But I 'm genuinely fond of you , " he protested . <p> " ' Genuinely fond , ' " she mocked . <p> " I know we 've never talked about love , if that 's your complaint . " <p> " True , " she said . " We have n't mentioned the word in nearly eight months , so saying good-bye should be easy . " <p> She requested a transfer and was installed as a receptionist for the School of Medicine , at the opposite end of campus . He sent her notes via @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had her home phone number changed and unlisted . <p> He must have arrived at a point where he needed an audience for his disappointment . He must have been visibly agitated , must have dropped hints at work , talked in his sleep , scribbled Mary's. old phone number on the wall beside his own phone , because when Lallie finally confronted him , it was with full knowledge of his betrayal . " You baby , " she said . <p> " So are we going to eat supper here or what ? " Max asks , shuffling into the kitchen . " I 'm really buzzed . Man , that scotch was swell . Do I love life or what ? " He swings open the refrigerator door and makes a face . <p> " I know it 's bad in there , " Ethan says . " I keep opening cans to feed the cats . I forget that Lallie took them . Why did n't she take the cat food , too ? " <p> " Never mind . I 'll phone in a pizza . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he slumps into a kitchen chair . <p> " Can you really believe all this is happening ? " Max says . " Look at us . Wow . I mean , that we 're even functioning . " <p> " You could call it that , if you wanted to give us the benefit of the doubt . " <p> " I do n't think any of it 's hit me yet , " Max says . " If it has registered , then I must be some sort of freak . " <p> " You freak , me jerk-off , " Ethan says . <p> " The thing of it is , " Max says , " is that if I could trade places with Dad , I 'd do it . " <p> " You do n't really mean that . " <p> " I do mean it . I know it sounds naive and sentimental . But I ca n't think of anybody who loves life as much as Dad , and who 's so good at it . " <p> " Mr. Doctor . Mr. Church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did it all , " Ethan says . He does n't mean to sound cynical . He does not . <p> " Was n't he always around when we were growing up ? Did n't he always sit on the front row of everything we did ? " <p> " Yes , " Ethan says , " he was a regular clone of a guy . " <p> " And did he ever gripe ? Did he ever look fed up or beat ? Ever hear him talk about being fragmented or overextended How did he do it ? How did he make life look so easy ? " <p> " Do n't ask me , " Ethan says . " I 'm just a bozo . " <p> " That 's just it , " Max says . " We 're both bozos . How did a man like that come up with two bozos for sons ? " <p> " It 's a mystery , " Ethan says . <p> " The thing of it is , " Max says , " is that he does n't think we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only it 's his delusion . He 's had us believing that we 're OK for years . " <p> " Vintage Dad . " <p> " You 're telling me . Like , man , I hear his primary nurse say he 's ' in denial , ' and I just have to snort up my sleeve , because what else is new He 's always been in denial . He thinks it 's a wonderful world . " <p> " Maybe it used to be , " Ethan says . " Maybe if we were n't such bozos we could see it his way . " <p> " Get this , " Max says . " Last week somebody leaves the lab report lying on his washstand and he picks it up and reads it , right ? He 's been a doctor for forty years , right ? He ai n't exactly dumb . So he 's looking at the lab reports and we all know that his blood gases are about as low as an amoeba 's and that the blast cells are multiplying like crazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fresh sack of platelets . But all he can say after he finishes reading is , ' Has your mother made arrangements with the home-healthcare people , because just as soon as they clear up the problem with my lungs , I 'm going home . ' " <p> " It 's a tough act to follow , " Ethan says . <p> " Did he know why you and Lallie split up ? " <p> " Yes , but the reasons were n't all that simple . " <p> " I guess you know that he would n't have been too pleased if he 'd known about one of them , " Max said . " Damn . I just realized that I 'm talking about Dad in past tense . " <p> Ethan shrugs . " Dad never cared much about the reasons behind things . He just wanted us to be happy . Maybe that 's why we 're bozos . " <p> " Happy , " Max says . " That 's some kind of planet , is n't it ? I 've been there a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the atmosphere 's too thin to sustain life . " He sits down at the kitchen table and begins rolling a joint . <p> " It 's after six , " Ethan says . " We need to get moving . What 's taking us so long ? " <p> " Maybe if we never go back , " Max says in a spooky voice , " he wo n't be able to die . " <p> " But Mom 's over there all alone . " <p> " They 're the last of the yea-sayers , Mom and Dad , " Max says . " After they 're gone , there wo n't be a soul left on earth who 'll forgive us. for being exactly who we are . " <p> " God , you 're depressing . " " I was just thinking the same thing , " Max says . " If I were more like Dad , I 'd try to find something good about all this , right ? Well , I do believe that I 've found one good thing that 's going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're stoned . " <p> " Come November and election time , with Dad out of the picture , there 's going to be one less vote for Jesse Helms . " <p> Max calls in a pizza order , then mellows out in the lounger , watching the news . Ethan lies down on the living room sofa to doze off the scotch . He dreams vaguely , fitfully , of his father . In the dream , Ethan is a child young enough to crawl into his father 's lap . The dream is nothing more than a static portrait of contentment . It has the golden atmosphere of a Sunday afternoon , the forgiveness of sins . He is leaning against his father , burrowing into his father 's wool coat , breathing him . It seems like an act of self-resuscitation . Waking abruptly to the invasive noise of Max and the Domino 's driver bantering in Spanish , he feels spellbound by comfort . <p> When Max returns to the living room he has a stricken look on his face . " You 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he says . <p> " It 's her . " " Her ? " <p> " Is n't that her ? " he says , parting a curtain . " The jogger . She just drove up . " <p> " You 're kidding . " Ethan springs from the sofa and looks out . Sure enough , a red Miata convertible , top down , is parked beside his mailbox . <p> The jogger is sitting in the passenger seat , gazing toward the house . " I do n't believe this , " Ethan says as the doorbell chimes . " This is ridiculous . What in the hell ? " Nevertheless he pads across the room in his sock-feet and opens the front door . The heat presses him backwards like a judgment . <p> Standing on the porch is a blackly tanned , muscle-swollen young man the size of an unbottled genie . He has a small , pugnacious face with hair so closely buzzed you ca n't tell the color . He 's wearing Bermuda shorts , loafers without socks , a sleeveless T-shirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " What can I do for you ? " Ethan says . <p> " Is that your Toyota in the driveway License plate AYB-1350 " <p> " It is . " <p> " You are Ethan A. Reynolds of 203 Grace Street ? " <p> " That 's right . " <p> " Who are you , the Census Bureau ? " Max says from behind Ethan . <p> Ethan cuts a look at him . <p> " Would you mind stepping outside for a minute , Mr. Reynolds ? " <p> " Well , " Ethan hesitates , " I do n't mind and I do mind . Maybe you ought to tell me what this is about . " <p> " You do n't have to stand here taking his inquisition crap , " Max tells Ethan . " It 's harassment and an invasion of your privacy . Tell him to beat it . Tell him we 'll call the cops . " <p> " I am the cops , " the man says . From the pocket of his shorts he produces an identification badge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to step out on the porch , sir . " <p> " All right , " Ethan agrees . " I need to get my shoes , do you mind ? They 're in the kitchen . " <p> Max follows him into the kitchen , where Ethan locates his huaraches under a chair . " Where 's his damn uniform if he 's a cop ? " Max says . <p> " I do n't know . Maybe he 's off duty . " <p> " You 're really going out on the porch ? This is crazy . " <p> " I know it 's crazy , " Ethan says . " Could the guy arrest me ? On what grounds I never even touched her , did I ? " <p> " You told her to go to hell , " Max says . " There 's some law against public profanity . " <p> " No kidding ? " <p> " If she swore out a complaint , if she 's a nut , maybe you could get arrested for that . Maybe she really thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driver nearly creamed her . " <p> " Shit . The scotch . What if he gives me a breathalyzer ? I believe that now would be a propitious moment for you to go flush your dope down the can , " Ethan says . " Why do n't you go do that , Max , while I see what the cop wants ? " <p> " I would n't go out there , Ethan . " <p> " Be a good bro ' . Phone Mom at the hospital and tell her we 've been delayed but that we 're on our way . " <p> " All right , " Max agrees . " Just do n't be a hothead out there . " <p> " You 're one to talk . " <p> When Ethan returns to the front porch , he sees the officer out by the Miata , talking to the jogger . He 's probably seven feet tall , and beside him the Miata looks like a matchbox car . He 's rubbing the jogger 's arm , with affection or condolence , Ethan ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the jogger 's boyfriend and that after Ethan 's altercation with her she jogged home , told her boyfriend about it , and he got himself into a chivalric huff . Even though he was n't on duty , he saw a need for retribution . <p> They are both very young and very handsome : sculpted as if poured from molds , laden with health , vitamin-enriched , cancer-free specimens of physically heroic Americans , staunch as flags , and he admires them . They seem pure in a way he is not . He admires and respects the boyfriend for championing the jogger . It 's an odd thing : the boyfriend reminds him of his father . Championing a woman who feels she has been wronged is something his father would do . It is not so much justified as old-fashioned , the boyfriend 's avenging gesture , and Ethan feels shamed by it . As be approaches the car , he holds out a hand to them , to shake on his contrition , to make amends and be forgiven , to let bygones be bygones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says , opening his arms in a gesture of supplication . " I made a mistake , and I 'm awfully sorry . " <p> The jogger glares at him , then averts her gaze . <p> " I was preoccupied , " Ethan tells her . " My brother and I had just come from the hospital  --  my dad 's sick  --  and I was thinking about a lot of things . I just was n't paying attention . That 's the gospel truth . It 's not like I meant to hit you or anything . " <p> " What do you think ? " the cop asks her , patting her arm . <p> " Still want to file a complaint ? " <p> " I do n't know , " she says . " Now he 's all smiles and politeness , but I 'm not fooled . " <p> " Of course you are n't . " <p> " Goddamn maniacs are always trying to pass themselves off as Mr. Niceguys .

" <p> " I sincerely wish it had n't happened , " Ethan says softly . <p> " But it did happen , " she says , glaring , " and I 'm never going to be the same . " <p> Ethan does n't know what to say . The woman is certifiably nuts . Of course she would be the same  --  this is what he believes . How could a person not be the same ? How could a person not get back to the place they 'd been before some idiotic episode threw them off course ? If you wanted to get back , could n't you ? He does n't contradict her . He sees that her hands are trembling and that she 's trying to subdue them , mashing them into her lap . <p> " From now on , " the jogger says , " every time I approach an intersection I 'm going to feel crazy . I 'm always going to anticipate the possibility of impact . " <p> " Hand me my radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downtown for you , " the cop tells her . " That 's what you want , is n't it , sugar ? " <p> " I want you to beat him half to death for me , like they do , " she says tearfully . <p> " Excuse me ? " Ethan says . <p> " Please , " the cop says , " do n't interfere . " Then to the woman , " Like in California , you mean ? " <p> " Please , " Ethan says , incredulous . Look , he wants to tell them , who among you has n't made similar mistakes of inattention , of obliviousness if you will It was n't as if he 'd been out on a joyride . There was no malice aforethought . He is sorry , plain and simple . He has said so most sincerely , and he feels the apology , like a lump of swallowed mud in his throat , push upwards again and again . He is sorry for everything : for scaring her , for the anger and inconvenience of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Lallie and Mary Palomino and the cat he pitched out on the highway twenty years ago . Every bit of it was avoidable . He is as sorry as he has ever been in his life , drenched with sorry , and in front of strangers . <p> " Officer ? " Ethan says . He wants to tell them they have caught him in the middle of a death , not merely an accident , that he is needed back at the hospital , that their timing is terrible , that his own is the genuine heartbreak . He means only to imply that life must go on , past near misses and misjudgments and , if not after death , then forever gallantly running towards it . He means to say that he understands everything now , so let him go . He abruptly takes hold of the cop 's elbow in a beseeching manner . <p> In one deft , athletic motion , more chiding than brutal , the cop spins Ethan around by his arms , forces him face-down in the yard , and shackles his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cop 's radio , disembodied voices , sputtering codes . <p> The smell of the grass is bitter and wild . He presses his cheek against the earth as if listening to a heartbeat and hears , instead , the intricate sizzle of crickets in the weeds . When he was a boy the sound meant something friendly . Now the crickets make a fierce , combustible noise , like the intimate roar that rises from his father 's chest  --  a death rattle , the doctors call it  --  a sound as inhuman as the violent gargle the kitchen sink made whenever Lallie poured dye into it , cleaning house , a sound that laments the elusiveness of peace , even for those who deserve it . <p> He does not deserve peace . He knows now what Mary Palomino meant when she called him an American . Granted the unconditional forgiveness of his upbringing , he had dared its continuance . He had never believed that no might simply mean no , that apology might not matter , that love might not revive no matter how much one grieved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like his precious father , he could be stopped . <p>
