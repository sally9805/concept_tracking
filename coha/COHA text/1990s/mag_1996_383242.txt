Twelve people tell about the dead-end jobs they passed through on their road to success // Elbow grease and the power of people Newspaper editor Don Wycliff still remembers the names of his fellow employees at the Albert Pick Motel Restaurant in Terre Haute , Indiana : " Evie Baker was the salad lady , and Archie Summers was the chef . " It was the summer of 1965 between high school and college . Wycliff was a dishwasher working days and evenings . " There was minimal exercise of the mind , " he says . " In retrospect , it was what people would call a dead-end job . " But Wycliff is glad he had it . " I learned a heck of a lot . " The lessons were mostly about people . " I worked with people who were really good folks , " he says . Baker was " kind of motherly , " and the chef " was a tall black man who was n't afraid to speak his mind .

Wycliff , 49 , earned 80 cents an hour at the motel restaurant and tried never to shortchange his employer on effort . " It was something my parents had been drilling into me from the time I was able to comprehend-to do your best no matter what , " he says . The experiences that summer readied him for the working relationships he would establish in college at the University of Notre Dame and later during his newspaper career . " I 'm the kind of person who does his best to get along with everybody . I try to see the best in people . " Wycliff , the editorial-page editor of the Chicago Tribune , spent years learning about the value of work on the staffs of such major papers as the Houston Post , Seattle Post-Intelligence , the Dallas Times-Herald , Chicago SunTimes , and the New York Times .

Church historian Martin Marty , 68 , recently requested his Social Security records to begin the steps toward retirement . The records reminded him of his first job and his worst job . He worked the last two summers of World War II on the assembly line making brake shoes for Sherman tanks . He worked six days a week , ten hours a day at the Rocklin Manufacturing Plant in Sioux City , Iowa . " It was like being a slave in a galley , you could n't sustain thoughts because of the numbness of it all , " he says . " My parents had just moved to Sioux City , and I wanted to make some money in a big hurry . " He was attending Concordia College , now Concordia University , in Milwaukee .

His vocation this summer was being husband of his wife and father of the bride when his daughter , Harriet , got married . " On top of vocation comes professionwhat are you trained for ? " Marty is trained to be a pastor , teacher , and writer . His career includes working 11 years as a pastor of various congregations and 33 years at the University of Chicago , where he spends his days lecturing , editing , and correcting papers .

Trumka , secretary-treasurer of the AFL-CIO , learned the value of work from Father John Hruska , pastor of his hometown parish in Nemacolin , Pennsylvania . During his homilies at Our Lady of Consolation Church , Hruska " always told the workers " story . " The priest used to tell parishioners in the coal-mining town that it was wrong to expose workers to hazardous conditions . Those lessons stuck with Trumka , 47 , during his life as a miner and union organizer . Work has been a driving force in his life since he was 10 years old , when he sold newspapers on street corners . At the age of 12 , he worked for a small stone quarry " busting rocks with a sledgehammer . " The owner of the quarry sold gravel . After school and during summer vacations in high school , he worked on a farm . He was a night watchman at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garage . " Man derives dignity from the work he does , " says Trumka . " I 've learned there is n't anyone who did n't want to contribute to society through their work . " Jobs have taught Trumka about discipline , responsibility , and teamwork . " Man is not an island-no matter what the job . " The worst job Trumka held also inspired him to seek the best job he has had-being a labor leader . Like both his grandfathers and his father , Trumka worked in coal mines . He first saw how workers were affected by labor strikes when he was a young boy . He asked his maternal grandfather how he could help workers on strike , and his grandfather advised him to go to law school . Trumka graduated from Pennsylvania State University and later worked the midnight shift in a coal mine while getting his law degree from Villanova University Law School . " I worked underground 3 1/2 years after I got my law degree , " he says .

Trumka spends his days campaigning for the rights of workers . " For a whole group of workers-America just is n't working for them . Nobody 's job is secure today . " Trumka says the greatest thing he has to offer workers is hope . He has traveled the country promoting the recent increase in the minimum wage . He wants to bridge the gap between the wages of corporate executives and their employees . " We have to learn to reward work in this country . " Who 's laughing now ? Author Maya Angelou learned to laugh from the job experiences that originally made her cry .

" They had been girls who I 'd helped with their homework and when they got into the workplace it was as if my face fell off . I learned that those young women were no more worthy of being my superiors then I was unworthy to be their inferior . " While those experiences were very disturbing for her , she says , " I also found them funny-privately I was able to laugh . I remembered how slow they were . " She took some comfort knowing they would have failed without her help . " What I continue to remember is that laughter , " she says . Angelou , author of I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings ( Bantam , 1971 ) , received a lifetime appointment in 1981 as the first Reynolds professor at Wake Forest University in North Carolina .

The award-winning author has written for television and movies , and her articles , short stories , and poems have been published in magazines and newspapers throughout the country . Angelou completed most of her writing before she began teaching . " If I had taught before I wrote , I probably would not have written anything , " she says .

" The best jobs for baby busters Career consultant Marilyn Moats Kennedy started working at the age of 14 as a clerk in a Christmas store in her hometown of Kansas City , Missouri .

And they do n't complainthey move on . Photograph Richard L.

That 's what Dartmouth cell biologist George L a n g f o r d learned working summer jobs in college . " As a college student , I was a soda jerk at a drugstore in New York City at 42nd and Eighth Street . It was a terribly unpleasant setting for me . But it was a big incentive to stay in college , " he says . " Even when you are in jobs like that you can draw upon those experiences .

The toughest job you 'll ever love Author and retreat master Pat Livingston says her favorite-but by far most challenging- job was motherhood .

You have to let go of your time , your privacy , and your body . That was the beginning of me really finding God in the immediate present experience , because there was no other way . " In Lessons of the Heart ( Ave Maria Press , 1992 ) , Livingston shares one of the ways in which she has put those lessons to work : " Life is not , and never was meant to be , an ongoing state of happiness . " This is also one of the lessons she passes on to priests , religious , and lay ministers who gather each year at the University of Notre Dame for her continuing education classes . Livingston began her career in ministry in 1978 teaching communication skills and parenting classes . She later developed lessons on listening , assertiveness , and conflict management into a course for seminarians .

I see more and more men getting into the parenting thing . The more they really do , the more they appreciate the mothering their wives do . " Army life drills in values Newspaper columnist Clarence Page knew when he was in high school that he wanted to be a journalist . But it took him a few jobs to get there , including several steel mill jobs . His first news job was writing obituaries for the Chicago Tribune .

It was so seasonal , and the mark-up was very high , " says the San Francisco federal judge . Noonan , 69 , has never had a job he did n't like .

A fan of customer service Baseball manager Vince Naimoli started putting customers first when he was 11 years old . As a paperboy in his hometown of Patterson , New Jersey , he used to deliver the Patterson Evening News . As a service to his customers , he also would purchase other papers at the downtown newsstand and deliver them , as well . Naimoli did n't charge any extra , but he got lots of great tips .

His favorite challenges involved looking for creative ways to solve problems . Naimoli once worked for a plant near Rochester , New York , where he had to get rid of more than seven million cans designed for food products . " We had a warehouse full of supposedly defective cans . I looked at those cans every day for a year . " He finally found a way to use the cans to package novelties . A graduate of the University of Notre Dame , Naimoli believes successful people have several qualities in common : they serve as role models , are persistent and determined , and know " there is no substitute for hard work . It 's a matter of leadership by example . " The science of success Professor Dorothy Feigl 's first job sounded delicious .

" The big thing was , I knew I did n't want to do this for a long time . " That is how Feigl eventually ended up as head of a women 's college . She kept trying things that left her wanting more from a career . She worked as a secretary or " Girl Friday " during the summers between college . " There are real skills associated with that , " Feigl says . But the job satisfaction was not there .

He had just returned from college in 1951 to his hometown of Latrobe , Pennsylvania when he turned on his parents ' new set .

" " My friends at NBC said I was crazy . " In 1966 he developed the half-hour " Mister Rogers " Neighborhood , " which is the longest-running children 's program on public television . For the past 30 years , Mister Rogers , 68 , has been helping children understand their feelings and develop self-esteem . " I 've had so many wonderful experiences in my life-what a blessing that is . That does n't mean that every minute of the time was absolute joy . In anybody 's work , there are stresses . The important thing is to build community . " Rogers , an author , pianist , and composer , has written the music and scripts and worked the puppets on the more than 600 shows produced by Family Communications Inc . This spring , " Mister Rogers " Neighborhood " aired an entire week of shows about work . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents go to work , " he says . His puppets , King Friday XIII and Queen Sara , worked while their son , Prince Tuesday , had a day and night sitter . When they returned , they expected their son to be happy to see them . Instead , the prince was upset that they had been away so much . " It is important for children to realize that there is such a thing as ambivalence . " The father of two sons and grandfather of two boys , Rogers says one of the greatest lessons parents can teach children about work is to enjoy what they do . Many of his programs feature people doing jobs . His " work " programs include footage of people making things such as peanut butter , bass violins , and stuffed bears .

I got the idea that going to work was really fun from him . " Whenever you 're feeling low , just remember your work-be grateful for your work and do it well . Work is one of the most satisfying things that a person can do if he or she is interested .
