ContentsPort Authority of the City of New York TOUR GUIDE # AN ELECTRIC CAR ROLLS north on the East Side Highway . It slows , pulls into the breakdown lane , right side close to the Wall , and stops next to a storm drain . In the car is a driver and three passengers . <p> The driver is called Carrie Nation . She gets out of the car and raises the hood . One of the passengers , a big man called Pancho Villa , opens the rear passenger-side door and goes to the trunk . He strains to lift out a heavy toolbox . <p> Carrie Nation 's green skirt blows and flutters in the hot damp breeze that descends the slope of the Wall from far above . Sweat springs to her brow as she props up the hood . She loosens the collar of her white blouse , rolls up her sleeves , and bends to look into the engine compartment . <p> Now the front door opens , bangs against the Wall as cars roar past . A young stream of dirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wall , running under the open car door , and trickles through a large grating into the storm drain . <p> The front-seat passenger , called Nikolai Lenin , crawls out of the car , keeping his head down . Nikolai Lenin is small and wiry . The car conceals him from the road , the open doors hide him from in front and behind . Only from the top of the Wall , two hundred feet above , might he be seen . He crouches and fumbles with the storm drain 's grating , as Carrie Nation putters under the hood . <p> Nikolai Lenin , Carrie Nation , and Pancho Villa form cell 34-D of the Marine Mammals Liberation Army . Along with one Leo Bugleman , who remains in the car , they intend to breach the Wall Around Manhattan and let in the sea . <p> Yesterday was Friday . <p> Over the bass monotone of the great pumps , the alarm clock shrilled . Across the room , Leo Bugleman awoke . He got out of bed , stumbled sleepily to the clock , silenced it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stove . Leo turned on the fire under it and made his way to the bathroom . <p> The pumps thrummed . The toilet flushed . The shower ran , then the sink . The kettle boiled . Leo emerged from the bathroom , his feet a little steadier now . There was still a blob of lather behind his left ear . He poured boiling water on coffee grounds and dressed as he waited for it to drip . <p> Buttoning his shirt , Leo stood before his window . It looked east , across Avenue D. Leo sneered out at the Wall . <p> The Wall was tall and ugly . As high as Leo could see , it was streaked white with seagull droppings , brown with rust , black with the exhalations of a billion diesel trucks . Trickles of dirty water ran down it , joining in polluted rivulets at the base . <p> Leo tucked his maroon tie between the second and third buttons of his blue shirt , shrugged on his uniform jacket ( size forty-four short ) , swilled a cup of coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glanced at his watch , grabbed his cap , and headed for the door . <p> Down three flights and out to the street . Leo hesitated at the front door , brushed back his thinning brown hair , put on his cap , made sure his earplugs were in . He opened the door , and winced as the sound of the pumps struck him . <p> The hot Wall breeze had not yet begun , it was chilly and damp in the Wall 's shadow . A stream flowed down Avenue D , rushing into the drains at the corner of Seventh Street . Leo 's nose wrinkled as he hurried past it . His lips moved as he chanted a sing-song litany , inaudible over the pumps : <p> " God damn Wall . <p> " Bastard Wall . <p> " God damn , son of a bitch , bastard Wall . " <p> Pancho Villa sets the toolbox on the concrete by the open rear door and gets back in the car . He leaves the door open . <p> Between the doors , the grating comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the storm drain . <p> A patrol car pulls up , an old-fashioned methanol burner , stinking of formaldehyde . A policeman sticks his head out the window . <p> " Y ' wan na move that heap right now , lady , or I 'll call the wrecker . " <p> " Just a minute , officer . I think I 've got it . " Carrie Nation fiddles under the hood , gets back in the driver 's seat . Meanwhile , Leo Bugleman crawls out of the car and disappears into the storm drain . <p> The patrol car pulls up in front of the electric , as Carrie Nation tries the motor . It hums to life . The policeman approaches , swaggering a little . Carrie gets out of the car and meets him halfway . She shows him her driver 's license ; the name on it is not " Carrie Nation . " Her blouse buttons have come open ; perhaps she shows him other things . In any case , he does not see Pancho Villa crawl out of the car . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Bad connection to the superconductor . It 's fixed . " She goes to the hood , closes it . It does n't quite catch . She raises the hood again and slams it , as Pancho muscles the toolbox into the storm drain and drops down after it . From below , several hands pull the grating back in place . <p> Carrie Nation saunters around the car , closing doors . She gets back in the driver 's seat , revs the engine . Preceded by the patrol car , she pulls out into traffic , leaving three men and a heavy toolbox in a storm drain that runs beneath the Wall . <p> It was nearly nine . <p> At Fourth Street , Leo Bugleman crossed Avenue D and hurried into a building that grew out of the Wall . An elevator took him up twenty stories , to the top . <p> The elevator opened onto a broad plaza . Here it was bright and warm . You could hardly hear the pumps . Crowds of tourists were beginning to gather , gawking in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue-green and clear . Breakers roared over the shattered towers of Brooklyn and Queens . On the horizon stood the Long Islands and the tan sails of the fishing fleet . <p> To the west was Manhattan , looking much as it had for the last hundred years . The Wall was n't tall , next to the skyscrapers of Downtown and Midtown  --  it was easy to ignore . <p> To the south , seagulls wheeled over the docks by the New Fulton Fish Market . It was n't new , and it was n't too close to Fulton Street some two hundred feet below , but that 's what they called it . <p> Leo saw none of this . He glanced at his watch and hurried across the plaza to the Tourist Information Center . Adjusting his cap , he entered by the door marked EMPLOYEES ONLY . <p> The emblem on his cap read : <p> Port Authority of the City of New York TOUR GUIDE The first tours of the Wall were about to start . <p> The tunnel is dark and cramped . Pancho Villa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead and scouts . Pancho is taller than Leo and has to duck under conduits to keep from hitting his head . The stream of water at their feet is shallow . It burbles and chuckles , following the drain 's gentle downward slope under the Wall , toward the sea . <p> Nikolai comes back . " It 's all right down to the cross tunnel . Come on . " He speaks with that accent once called " Brooklyn " or " Joisey . " But Brooklyn is drowned now , and so is much of New Jersey . It always was a New York accent  --  now New Yorkers must admit it . <p> Leo and Pancho hurry , as well as they can , to the cross tunnel . It is a maintenance tunnel , seldom used . It is relatively dry . <p> " This goddam nuke is heavy , " complains Leo , setting his end down . " At least we 're out of the water . " <p> " You 're soft , " says Pancho . " I tote industrial equipment all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pancho Villa is muscular . His grandparents came illegally from lost Trinidad , but his speech does not betray them . <p> " Ai n't much plutonium in a nuke , " says Nikolai . " Mostly steel and plastique . That piece of plutonium 's about the size of a  --  you know  --  a grapefruit . You remember grapefruit , Leo ? " <p> " Seen one once , " says Leo . " Macy 's had some in from California . Expensive . " He picks up his end of the nuke again , and the three continue down the tunnel . <p> Leo 's first group was from somewhere near Cleveland . They looked wealthy . And bored , as Leo went mechanically through his spiel . At least they all spoke English . Leo could deliver his talk in memorized French , Spanish , and Japanese , but ridding questions was hard . And if you did n't answer questions , you did n't get good tips . <p> As usual , the children asked most of the questions . <p> " What 's all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " No , " said Leo for the ten thousandth time , " it 's condensation . The Wall is cool , especially near the top where it 's thin , because the ocean water is cold . " He leaned to pat the kid  --  an ugly little girl of about five  --  on the head . <p> " No , it is n't , " said the tyke , pulling away from Leo . " We swimmed in the ocean at Trenton . It was warm . " <p> " And then we got in the boat and sailed over Philadelphia , " piped up a little boy . " It was neat , like that , " he said , pointing to Brooklyn . <p> " Is that Philadelphia ? " said the little girl . " I wan na go in the boat again , Mommy . " She started to sniffle and whine . Her parents looked annoyed . Leo mentally kissed his tip goodbye . <p> " Like Philadelphia , Boston , and other coastal cities , " he said , gamely continuing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ocean rose during the middle of the last century . Manhattan was spared only by chance . " <p> " Did n't they build the Wall on purpose ? " heckled a teenager from the back of the crowd . <p> Ignoring the heckler , Leo continued . " The Wall is almost thirty miles long . The sea water is , on average , one hundred ninety feet deep , and presses on the Wall with a total force of ninety million tons . " No effect . The numbers usually got a rise out of the techno-weenier , but there did n't seem to be any today . <p> Leo led his group to the inside edge of the Wall . Near the railing , a life-sized statue of a man looked out over the Lower East Side . The statue was gaudy  --  green with patina , black and white with pigeon and seagull droppings . Its arms were raised as if in blessing , or victory . On its head was a spot of bright polished bronze . <p> " This is Christophe O'Flanagan , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2027 , during the Saint Patrick 's Day parade , he had a vision . He said the sea would rise thirty feet . The experts laughed  --  three feet , they said , maybe six , no more . But New Yorkers believed O'Flanagan  --  that 's what things were like in the Twenties . Then , when the Antarctic ice cap began to slide into the sea  --  against all predictions  --  the Wall was already started . For fifty years our heroic engineers worked on it , keeping just ahead of the rising water . At two hundred feet , they stopped . " Leo paused . " So did the sea - we hope . " <p> No reaction . Most of the tourists were just looking at the ocean , enjoying the Wall weather . <p> " This is supposed to be good luck , " said Leo . He reached over and patted the statue on the head , on the shiny spot . Some of the tourists did the same . <p> " I wan na pet the statue , " said the little girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little girl waved a hand and hit the statue on the nose , on a fresh seagull dropping . " Ewww , yucky ! " she said , wiping her hand on Leo 's coat . <p> THE PUMPS are louder now . Pancho and Leo have successfully navigated the cross tunnel . Now Nikolai points to a ladder descending into blackness . <p> " Old subway tunnel , " he says . " Use your earplugs . Hand signals from here on . " <p> Wearing miners ' lamps , they descend , lugging the toolbox . The subway tracks are gone ; the tunnel floor is a torrent , water rushing toward the pumps below the East River . <p> ( They still call it the East River , that piece of the Atlantic between the Wall and the broken teeth of Brooklyn , where the draggled cobweb of the Brooklyn Bridge lies in wait to snare unwary ships . ) <p> Along the tunnel 's wall runs a catwalk , safely clear of the rushing water . The three men and the nuke edge along it until they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his lunch break , Leo went down to Embassy Row . It was the first Friday of the month . He was making his rounds . <p> The sun had cleared the Wall ( " God damn Wall , " said Leo ) , and the embassy gardens shone with sunlight . Leo slowed down for a moment to look at the flowers . <p> From the street vendor at the corner of Sutton Place , Leo got a soft pretzel and a hot dog . Wolfing them down , he hurried into the New Jersey embassy . He did n't need to look at the lobby signboard , but went straight to the visa office . <p> He pushed his papers across the counter . " Bugleman , Leo . I have an appointment . " <p> " Yes , Mr. Bugleman . " The clerk looked like a New Yorker , but she spoke without a trace of New York accent . " I 'm afraid I have bad news for you . " <p> " But . . . I thought I was near the top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Bugleman . You 're number twenty-three . In your category . But New Jersey does n't need civil or mechanical engineers right now . " <p> Or tour guides , thought Leo , or physicists . " Well , what do you need ? I can take more night courses . . . " <p> " Well , Mr. Bugleman , if you had , say , a Ph.D . in biomechanical engineering with a specialty in pseudoviral turboencabulation , you would be eligible for Preference Category VII-A1 . On the other hand , pharmacological statisticians are , you 'll pardon me , a drug on the market . " She tittered offensively . " Here is a list of the current preference categories . It 's good to the end of the month . " <p> Leo took the list  --  it was n't long  --  and glanced at it . His fist clenched , crumpling the comer of the paper . But he smiled and said " thank you , " just the same . <p> Nikolai has been scouting ahead again . Now he returns . Silently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set the nuclear toolbox down . It clangs loudly on the catwalk . <p> " What is it ? " Pancho shouts to be heard over the pumps . <p> Nikolai approaches , huddles with Pancho and Leo . " Maintenance crew . Maybe comin ' this way . Be quiet . " <p> The catwalk is exposed . There is no place to hide . They turn off their miners ' lamps and sit by the nuke , in the dark . It does not glow , but there seems to be a glow far off in the tunnel . <p> They wait . After a long time , the glow brightens , resolves into two glows , bobbing in the darkness , approaching . <p> The water rushes , the pumps roar . Yet the three men sit unmoving , as if their slightest movement would be heard . Leo is hunched together , arms around his knees , head down . Pancho presses against the wall . <p> Nikolai has a gun , a revolver . Its blued steel is black in the dim light of the oncoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others . He motions to his ears . They remove their earplugs . Leo winces . " Wait till they get close , " says Nikolai . " Then we take ' em . Throw the bodies in the water . " He goes back to watching the distant lights . <p> Leo shudders as he reinserts his earplugs . <p> The lights continue to approach . But there is something odd . They do n't seem to be coming straight on anymore . <p> Leo taps Pancho 's shoulder , leans forward and taps Nikolai . " The other catwalk , " he says . " They 're on the other side . " <p> The maintenance workers approach . Indeed , they are on the other side of the tunnel . The three men and the bomb sit still and silent as the maintenance crew goes past . Once , one of the circles of light scans the water , crosses it , caresses the wall not twenty feet from them . It lingers , then returns . The three men release their breaths in chorus . The nuke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the maintenance crew is out of sight . Leo , Nikolai , and Pancho get up and turn on their miners ' lamps . <p> " Jesus , " says Leo , " Jesus . " <p> " Jesus ? I thought you was Jewish , " says Pancho . <p> In the last group of the day , there was a chatty blue-haired lady from Sun City , Arizona . " You must love it here , " she said . " The weather 's wonderful . Everywhere else it 's so hot and muggy . " <p> That did it for Leo . " You like it , huh ? " he said . " Nice cool sea breeze . That 's Wall weather , lady . That 's what makes it Hell down there . " He pointed down , toward the base of the Wall . <p> The tourist shrank from the energy in Leo 's voice . Leo did n't notice . He continued : " That nice cool breeze drops right down the Wall . Picking up steam . Picking up heat . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken enough night courses for a Master 's . " It 's cool up here , but it 's plenty hot and muggy down there . " Leo waved vaguely in the direction of his apartment building . " We do n't all stay at the Wall Hilton , lady . Some of us have to live next door to this thing . " Leo kicked at the Wall with his heel . <p> " Well ! " said the tourist . " I never ! Your superiors are going to hear about this , Mr.  --  " She peered at his badge . " Mr. Bugleman . " She pronounced it " bug lemon . " <p> " I 'll tell you what , lady , you can tell them anything you please . " Leo loosened his tie . " because I do n't really give a rat 's ass . " He took off his cap . " I do n't give a flying fuck for the Port Authority , and they can KEEP THEIR GOD DAMN WALL ! " Leo skimmed his cap like a Frisbee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landed in the bus lane , where it was promptly run over . <p> Leo did n't even bother to sign out . He took the elevator to the street and went straight to O'Flanagan 's Bar . <p> " This is the spot , " says Leo . They are in a disused subway station , deep under the Wall . The pumps are not so noisy here , and there is not so much water . They can talk . <p> " It better be , " says Pancho . " We 've lugged this thing far enough . " They set the nuke down , none too gently . <p> " This is it , " said Leo . " I know everything about the Wall . Its strong points , its weak points . This is a weak point . Maybe the weakest . " <p> Pancho and Leo sit down by the bomb . Nikolai is scouting the stairwells , and the places where the escalators used to be . <p> " You hate the Wall , " says Pancho . " How come you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to love the Wall , " says Leo . " When I was a kid , they were still building it . " He smiles . " They were my heroes  --  the Wall engineers . I wanted to be one . I wanted to help make the wonders of the post-modern world , the newer Colossus , to replace the Statue of Liberty . And then they went broke . " <p> Pancho shrugs . " We still got the Wall . So what if we do n't build nothing else . Who needs it ? " <p> " I need it , " says Leo . " I studied civil engineering , I studied mechanical engineering , I studied freaking physics of materials , so when they started up again , I could be part of it . For half a century , New York was Number One in construction , and now what have we got ? Fifty thousand unemployed engineers , is what . " <p> " So , " says Pancho . He seems to be trying to think . " What do you get from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You think they 're gon na rebuild after we set this off ? You think they 're gon na hire you ? Sure  --  hire Leo , the Mad Bomber . " Pancho laughs . " Shit , there ai n't gon na be any New York after we set this off . Just two hundred feet of water and a lot of dead citizens . " <p> " Screw the Wall , " says Leo . " I 'm sick of New York , sick of the Goddamn Wall . I 'll take any job I can find , in California , after we get away . This bastard " ( he gestures at the Wall around him ) " has burned me out . That 's all . " <p> O'Flanagan 's was n't crowded at four in the afternoon . Leo looked around the place as if he had never been there before . The holos of the Wall under construction used to make him nostalgic ; now they filled him with bile . He wanted to yell at the big bust of Christophe O'Flanagan behind the bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of drugs were you on at that parade ? Why make us waste our future ? Why build that prison Wall ? <p> Come to think of it , the whole bar was a pain in the ass . The Twenties decor  --  all shades of olive and red , with little Gothic spires on the booths , and twin laser chandeliers  --  was enough to drive you to drink . Maybe that was the idea . Leo ordered another . <p> Six o'clock came . The bar began to fill with the after-work crowd . Leo nibbled on bar snacks , waiting . There was someone he needed to see . <p> Finally she arrived . His old friend Shirley Green . Green Shirley , they called her back at CUNY . Here she was with her radical friends , the porpoise freaks . Leo smiled and walked over to their table . <p> " Hiya , Shirley . How ya doin ' ? Can I sit down ? " Without waiting for an answer , Leo pulled up a fourth chair . <p> " Jeeze , Leo , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my code name . You know Pancho and Nikolai . " <p> " Yeah , well , code name or not , you 're Shirley to me . Anyhow , this is business . " <p> " Bullshit , Leo . You 're drunk . Why do n't you go away  --  something 's come up , we 're making serious plans . " <p> " Maybe you should listen to me first , " said Leo . " You remember that project we talked about , the one you keep trying to suck me into ? " <p> " Oh , yeah , " said Shirley . " Using the weak spot in  --  mmmph . " Nikolai had reached across the table and put his hand over Shirley 's mouth . <p> " Do n't say it , " said Nikolai . " We know what he 's talkin ' about . " <p> " I 've made up my mind , " said Leo . " If you can get me out of New York afterward , I 'm in . " <p> " Wow ! How totally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , swaggering from his inspection tour . " Nobody , " he says , " like we thought . They think we do n't know their secret weakness , so they do n't guard it . " He takes one end of the toolbox and drags it to the center of the platform . <p> " Shit , Nikolai , it 's a nuke , " says Pancho . " It do n't matter where you put it . Set it up and let 's get out of here . " <p> Nikolai looks left and right , drags the bomb another few inches . He pulls out a key , unlocks the toolbox , and raises the lid . Instead of tools , there is a steel panel . On it , two switches and a dial are labeled in Hebrew . Nikolai flips the switches . <p> Pancho has been looking at the bomb . " So that 's where this came from . Christ , it must be old . You think it will work ? " <p> Leo speaks up . " Plutonium bomb  --  it 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He glares at Nikolai . " This came from Dimona . It ca n't be clean . We 're fucking radioactive . You son of a bitch . " <p> " Radioactive ? Not much , " says Nikolai . " Takes over a week to get a lethal dose . It 's the cause that matters . We must avenge the whales . " He pulls a small box from his shirt pocket . It looks like an old-fashioned calculator . <p> " I do n't give a damn about your cause , " says Leo . " I want to get out of New York . And if nuking the Goddamn Wall is what it takes , that 's what I 'll do . But the whales are dead , along with the tuna and the freaking anchovies . You ca n't bring them back . " <p> " And you ca n't bring back the glory days of New York , " says Nikolai . " No more than your grandfathers could bring back the space program , or their grandfathers the railroads . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We ca n't bring ' em back , but we can take revenge . " Nikolai stops pressing buttons and looks up . " It is programmed . Nothing can stop us now . " He places one foot on the bomb . " The whales are dead . Their spirits cry for vengeance . " He spreads his arms and shouts , " Now we liberate them ! Our  --  " He hesitates , pulls a white card from his shirt pocket , shines his lamp on it . " Our auto-da-fe will free those spirits forever ! Let the sea claim New York , as is its due ! " <p> He turns to Pancho . " Did you get that , or shall I do it again ? " <p> Pancho puts a microcam back in his pocket . " I got it . Let 's get out of here . " <p> Leo approaches Nikolai . He points to the little box . " Is that the detonator ? " <p> " Yeah , " says Nikolai . " This sends the code sequence to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By then we 'll be in California . " <p> " What if we 're not ? " asks Leo . " What if the boat does n't come ? " <p> " I can reprogram it , " says Nikolai . " And if we 're caught , I can detonate it instantly . " He indicates a recessed red button on the box . " Now . We go back the way we came ? " <p> Leo pulls out a pocket computer , punches some keys . Nothing seems to happen . He looks nervous , mutters " Goddamn Wall , " punches more keys . A blueprint of the Wall appears on his screen . He studies it for a moment . <p> " Yes , " says Leo . " It 's the only way . " <p> Leo left the bar smiling . They had bought it  --  he was in . <p> He smiled as he walked toward his apartment . Nuke the Goddamn Wall . What a sight . He closed his eyes and saw the nuke go off  --  the hundred-meter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racing around Manhattan at the speed of sound in steel  --  ninety million tons of sea water washing the Wall away as if it had never been . <p> Outside his apartment building was a telephone booth . Leo entered it , pulled a worn business card from his shirt pocket , and dialed the number on it . The phone rang and rang . Leo let it ring . In his mind , he watched a wall of water wash over his apartment building ( no great loss there ) , scour the Lower East Side , raze Greenwich Village , Park Avenue , Harlem , purge every neighborhood in the city , carry two-point-three million bodies to a mass grave in Central Park . He grimaced . Nuke tile Goddamn Wall . How skewed . Eventually a gruff voice answered the phone . " NYPD . Dennis . " <p> " This is Leo Bugleman . It 's on for tomorrow . " <p> " Tomorrow ! That 's quick . Where are they ? I 'll have ' em picked up . " <p> " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move every night . And there 's the other problem . " <p> " What 's that ? " <p> " The nuke . It 's remote-controlled . They could set it off . " <p> " Sounds like Plan B , then . You gon na go along with us , Bugleman ? " <p> " Plan B. I spot the detonator , then I call you in . I can do it  --  I 'll find some excuse to use my computer , tell you where to pick us up . What 's in it for me ? " <p> " You want out  --  we can get you out . Not California , though . " <p> " It has to be legal . Passport and all . I need the right to work . " <p> " We can get it . Looks like Pennsylvania or Connecticut  --  they owe us big ones . Any preference ? " <p> " Shit , " said Leo . " Pennsylvania , I guess . Not the garden spot of the world . " <p> " For Christ 's sake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and never worked in your field . " <p> " Me and fifty thousand others . " <p> " Yeah , well , nobody wants them , either . " <p> ON THE WAY back , Nikolai swaggers and brags . Pancho is the cautious one now . He looks for lights in the distance , tries to listen for noises through the din . Leo stays close to Nikolai but does not try to speak . <p> They reach the access tunnel easily , and are greeted by the stink of diesel and methanol fumes . Leo blinks in the bright light . Pancho moves cautiously to the grate , looks up through it . Carrie Nation 's car is again parked there . Its rear passenger-side door is open . <p> Pancho and Leo move the grating aside . Leo climbs up , reaches down , and takes Nikolai 's hands to help him up . He hoists Nikolai out of the tunnel . <p> Suddenly there are uniforms everywhere , and guns . " Freeze ! Police ! " shouts a voice . Rough hands seize Leo and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun is taken . <p> Pancho sticks his head up , looks around . " Oh , shit ! " he cries and disappears back down the tunnel . Two policemen go down after him . " I 'm Leo , " says Leo . " Let me go . " <p> One of the police , a paunchy sergeant , looks at a holo he is holding . " You look like him . " He inspects Leo closely . " This guy is okay . Let him go . " <p> As Leo is released , shots ring hollowly from the tunnel . Nikolai 's captor , startled , loses his grip on Nikolai 's right arm . Nikolai reaches for his shirt pocket . <p> Leo is faster . Before Nikolai can get to the detonator , Leo has it . " It 's okay , " he shouts , " I have it . " He looks at the little black calculator and its recessed red button . <p> Reporters are there , with microcams and sound equipment . They take pictures of Nikolai being handcuffed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got him , " he says . <p> A police colonel , all gold braid and swagger stick , comes up to Leo . There is a deputy mayor with him . " You 're a hero , " says the politician . " You 've saved New York . " <p> " Screw New York , " says Leo . " They said I could emigrate . " <p> The police colonel looks sour around the mouth . " It 's been arranged . Pennsylvania will take you . Your papers are being prepared . " <p> The deputy mayor beckons to the reporters . As the microphones press in , he takes Leo 's hands , struts a little for the cameras . He draws a breath and begins to speak . <p> " The citizens of New York thank you . You have saved the wonder of the post-modem world , the spirit of New York City  --  our Wall . " He gestures at the Wall , points up to its rim , where the bronze statue blesses the city . " The Wall Around Manhattan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And foremost among those heroes , the first and the latest  --  Christophe O'Flanagan and  --  " he pauses , smiles for the cameras , and pumps Leo 's hand  --  " Leo Bugleman . " He pronounces it " bug lemon . " <p> Leo turns toward the Wall . He thinks of green Pennsylvania fields but sees streaks of rust and grime . He thinks of bird songs but hears the raucous cry of seagulls . He thinks of escape , but feels the anguish of two-point-three million imprisoned souls . <p> Leo looks up and sees Christophe O'Flanagan , overlooking Manhattan like a warden . The hot damp Wall breeze strikes his face . His eyes blur , and he sees another figure by Christophe  --  Leo himself , a deputy warden in bronze . I saved your Wall , he thinks  --  I saved your Goddamn Wall . <p> Ninety million tons of water whisper to Leo , pressing , promising . He looks at the deputy mayor , at the police colonel . He thinks of Pennsylvania . A tear rolls down his cheek , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says quietly , and presses the red button . <p> ILLUSTRATION <p> <p> By Bill Vaughan <p> Bill Vaughn 's short fiction has appeared in Analog . He lives in the Bay Area with his wife Mary and has worked in the computer industry since 1969 <p> This story , he says , came into being when he was invited into an anthology about New York City in the future . He got the idea about a wall around Manhattan then , but was n't able to use it until years later  --  too late for the anthology , but just right for us . <p>
