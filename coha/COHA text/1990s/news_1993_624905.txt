<p> I was 16 and she was 14 , a yawning chasm of age difference at that time of life  --  magnified by the fact she was also my best friend 's sister . <p> Her brother Mitch and I met the first day of high school and instantly became inseparable , a bond sealed by our mutual passion for adolescent pranks and disdain for authority , oddly commingled with an insatiable intellectual curiosity . <p> Mitch and I worked together one summer at Sunshine Laundry , and that 's how I came to meet his sister . <p> It was a lousy job . The laundry had hundreds of rugs that customers had brought in for cleaning and then stored at the laundry . Sunshine was expanding and needed the storage space . For 65 cents an hour , I got up every morning at 6 and rode my bike up the hill to Mitch 's house . Then he and I rode to the laundry , where all day we hauled rugs to a new storage location . <p> The rugs were heavy , and most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for years . The days were hot , and we sweated profusely . After an hour or two of hauling , we looked like coal miners . <p> It was in this grimy condition that we rode our bikes back to Mitch 's house each day for lunch . He was the oldest of four children , and most of them were around at lunchtime , as well as his mom . All I ever noticed was Laura . <p> She was n't a beauty  --  kind of gawky and coltish  --  but I loved her the first moment I saw her , with the kind of all-newness that only happens once . She ate lunch with us over the summer , and as I came to know her , I saw in her the same goofy sense of humor that had made her brother and me best friends . <p> I was captivated by her mannerisms , the way she had of tilting her head and shifting her jaw back and forth when we teased her , her mock anger and her petulant pout . I lay awake nights picturing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreamed of her . <p> I could tell that despite my coal-miner disguise , she liked me , too . <p> But I was powerless to let on how I felt about her . I was , after all , her brother 's friend , and she was , after all , just a kid . Mitch and I were tough and cool . We talked all the time about girls at school , their more noticeable attributes and what we 'd like to do with them . How could I have anything to do with his sister ? <p> All summer the sweet torture continued nearly every weekday at lunch . I began finding excuses to drop by Mitch 's house at other times , hoping to see her , but I never confided my feelings to anyone . If I did have the good fortune to see her , all I could do was find something to tease her about . <p> The summer ended , and school resumed . One morning I stopped by to pick up Mitch on the way to school . His room was on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stairs when I passed by the converted hallway that served as Laura 's bedroom . Usually , there was a curtain drawn across the doorway to the stairs , but this morning it was open . Laura was in bed , just awakening , and I saw her for just a moment . A moment I 've carried with me for more than 30 years . <p> She was sitting up in bed , and the morning sun , coming in the far window , was in her hair . But it was her eyes that I remember , the freshness and clearness and softness in them as she awoke to the new day . We saw each other . It was just a moment , and then I continued bolting up the stairs , calling back over my shoulder , " " Time to get up , sleepyhead ! " I 've replayed that moment a thousand times in my mind . <p> I was 16 , full of raging hormones , and I 'd just seen a pretty girl in her bed . But I had n't even glanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes . I desperately longed to kiss her  - -  just one tender , delicate kiss , then gently brush her hair from her face , caress her cheek , look long into those miraculous eyes and whisper to her that at that moment she was the most beautiful creature I 'd ever seen , and that my heart ached for her . <p> It did n't happen . I could n't let it happen . <p> Mitch 's mom and my mom spent a lot of time on the phone together , and it became clear that Laura really liked me . There was a lot of motherly plotting to get us together , but there was nothing I could do . I was paralyzed by the innate shyness that hid under my joking and by the unwritten code that forbade dating your friend 's sister . <p> Near the end of that summer , a song became popular on the Top-40 stations : " " Tell Laura I Love Her " . It was one of those truly stupid , late ' 50s rock ' n ' roll songs about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is killed in a stock-car accident , and his dying words are the song 's title . The boy 's name , coincidentally , was mine . The song began : <p> " " Laura and Tommy were lovers , " <p> " " He wanted to give her everything . . . " <p> " " But most of all , a wedding ring " . <p> Inane , a shameless tear-jerker , but I listened to it over and over  --  in secret , of course . <p> It meant something to Laura as well , and her mom let my mom know that Laura wanted me to give the record to her as a present . <p> I gave her the record , but in such a perfunctory manner that the meaning was lost . I acted as if I did it only because I 'd heard she wanted me to  --  never acknowledging how much I 'd wanted to do it , too . <p> Mitch and I stayed friends through high school , then gradually drifted apart . Laura went to the same school , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shared a class . I saw her only once in a while , when we passed each other in the halls . I had my friends , and she had hers . <p> I went away to college , graduated and began a career . I saw her only one more time . I was working at a J.C . Penney store , and Laura was shopping there with some friends or relatives . There were a couple of little kids with them , and Laura was struggling to keep them under control . She looked tired , hassled and unhappy . She 'd lost the glow I remembered . It was as if the flower I 'd seen just beginning to unfold had never blossomed . She did n't see me , and I did n't speak . I did n't know , and I still do n't , if the children were hers . <p> Mitch and I are still friends , I guess , although we live in different cities and see each other mainly at 10-year intervals for high school class reunions . We laugh and talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke with him he told me Laura was living in a small town , working in a shoe factory , where the din of the machinery has caused her to lose most of her hearing . She 's married to a guy who does n't treat her very well . <p> I 've been married more than 25 years and have a happy life with my wife and two grown children . <p> Still , I wish Laura knew how much I loved her that summer of 1958 , and how her eyes still haunt me . I do n't know if it would have made any difference at all in the way her life turned out , or mine , but I wish I 'd stopped on the stairs that morning so long ago . <p> I wish I 'd kissed her . I wish I 'd told her . <p> NOTES : Tom Kiske is a property tax consultant who lives in Clear Lake .
