<p> This is a town where some of the locals still like to point out that Hattie McDaniel , who was in " Gone With the Wind , " lived here in the early 1900s , as if anyone , frankly , my dear , gives a , well , rip . Not Clark Gable or Vivien Leigh or Olivia de Havilland . Hattie McDaniel . But that 's fine . See , Fort Collins , located about 30 miles from the Wyoming border , knows its place . It 's not big-city , bright-lights Denver ; it 's not trendy Boulder ; it 's not glitzy Aspen . It 's just Fort Collins , former home of Hattie McDaniel . It 's an eminently pleasant town that is home to Colorado State University ( CSU ) . The school also knows its place because it labors in the long and sometimes arrogant shadow of the nearby University of Colorado ( CU ) at Boulder . CU has produced a Supreme Court justice , a Nobel Prize-winner , a national championship football team and 172 players for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Scads of celebrities send their children to very-in CU . CSU produces veterinarians and crop specialists . It 's about the same relationship French-cuff shirts have to blue collars . The CSU football team fits right in with the local understated attitude . It knows its place . That means , heretofore , trying to play - and not very well - out here in the widely ignored Western Athletic Conference ( WAC ) . CSU is modest about itself and its accomplishments , which is good because the Rams have much to be modest about . Indeed , CSU has been just one of the boys in the conference , not holding any major records other than longest losing streak : 26 in 1960 and 1962 . Look out . The " aw shucks " guys with dirt on their boots suddenly are emerging as the newest collegiate football powerhouse . They finished 17th in the final Associated Press poll last year with an 11-2 record - best in school history - and ranked ahead of national big-timers Washington , Texas A &M,; and Syracuse . They had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Penn State had . Everybody is picking the Rams as a Top 20 team for this fall . One magazine , Street &; Smith , puts CSU an eye-popping eighth . Head coach Sonny Lubick , who arrived in 1993 , broods at his desk : " You 're always concerned because the expectations have risen . The fans are all runnin ' around saying we 're going to be really good . That 's scary . I wish I could enjoy the good times . Trouble is I ca n't . " Nor , really , does CSU know how . It has had so little success , prior to Lubick 's arrival , that the previous seven coaches were unceremoniously fired . Prior to the glories of last season and 1994 's 10-2 , many consider 1948 the most successful season when the mark was 8-3 . Says offensive coordinator Steve Fairchild , " We tend to be realistic about who we are . " It is this characteristic that will serve the Rams well as they attempt to take their place among the elite , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fourth-longest in the nation . " We have a chance to be pretty good , " says Lubick . That amounts to full-throated braggadocio at CSU . " But every team in the country believes it 's pretty good , " he quickly adds , as if concerned he may have strutted slightly . " Every team is either gettin ' better or gettin ' worse . " <p> The crucible comes early Possibly in an omen , CSU will play college football 's first game this year on Aug. 29 against Michigan State . The next week the Rams play CU . Victories over both - a possibility that one time would have been outrageous fantasy - conceivably could set up CSU for its first-ever excursion into the Top 10 . And , dare anyone suggest it , perhaps a national championship ? " Come on , " scoffs Lubick , " we 're Colorado State . " He shakes his head at such absurdity . But he ca n't help warming a bit : " It would be the miracle of miracles . I hope I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can and they are beautifully naive . You have to dream big . But I 'm old enough to know what it takes . " He does , because he was an assistant coach at the University of Miami during two of its national championship years , in ' 90 and ' 92 . He wore those rings in his first meeting with the CSU team in 1993 . " I do n't know why , " he says . " I was so frightened and I was thinking if I can just go 5-5 , it will be my happiest day . We do that a couple years and people will think I 'm OK . " Going into his sixth year , Lubick is 41-19 , and the Rams have won the WAC title three of the last four years . So much for winning just half the games . The unvarnished truth is CSU has little reason to be this good . The Rams have a small ( 30,000 seat ) stadium , which works out because it seldom is filled . Admits media-relations director Gary Ozello , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are suspicious . " The athletic department is $ 500,000 in debt and Lubick says , " With all of our success , we 're still going down . We 're sinkin ' . We 're sittin ' here with a football budget of $ 2.8 million and CU is sittin ' down there with $ 9 million or $ 10 million . " Actually , CU says its budget is only $ 5.7 million , which is still more than twice CSU 's . But , CSU has one enormous plus : Sonny Lubick . He is proof that one person can make the difference . " It 's not one guy , " protests Lubick . " The difference is one guy , " says Tom Ehlers , defensive-line coach . Believe Ehlers . What Lubick has brought to CSU is a steely realism acquired growing up in Montana where not much of anything is easy but where he says there 's " a passion for football . " His dad was a miner ; as head coach at Montana State , Sonny made $ 11,000 a year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Montana : " When it 's really cold here , he says it gets a lot colder in Montana . Everything is worse in Montana . " Lubick 's philosophy is dead simple : " The only chance we 've got , " he says , " is working at it , staying together , and trying to be as straightforward and truthful as we can . " He says it 's a joke that CSU football season tickets are $ 99 compared with more than $ 200 at most places . Life is simple when words are straight . <p> A Chevy versus a Cadillac Ask him how CSU does recruiting against CU and he is predictably forthright : " Not good . CU still gets ' em . You take a kid to Colorado coach Rick Neuheisel 's office , then look at this . " One tragically worn chair has been living in Lubick 's office since 1981 . The office has all the charm of a trucking warehouse . Continues Lubick , " You look at CU 's training table and then look at ours . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Which one do you want ? Now that 's nothin ' against Chevy . Chevy is all I 've ever driven . " Of course . Still , asked if he can win with CU 's leftovers and left-outs and he says , " I believe we can . " Lubick is also correct when he says , " We 're not like Nebraska . The worst thing that can happen to them is they go 7-4 . Whereas at our place , we 're pretty fragile . We can go either way . We 're a lot closer to 3-8 than people realize . " The other day , the father of a CSU non-scholarship player got a full dose of Lubick-style honesty . He phoned to ask if his son finally might be given a scholarship . Said Lubick , " Of 100 guys , he is the least deserving . He has n't done a thing . " In fact , Lubick went on , the youngster has contributed so little that the Rams had to go recruit another player to play his position " so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although this father might not believe it , fullback Washington says the players like Lubick because " he 's firm but not firm to the point where there is no leeway . " All these hopes easily could be shattered , maybe early against Michigan State and Colorado - " We could play very well and lose , " says Lubick - and maybe often during the rest of the season . Those who see glasses half empty instantly question fifth-year quarterback Ryan Eslinger , who is getting his first chance as a starter . Says offensive coordinator Fairchild , " He has a chance . We 'll see how he does . I trust him . " Any team with quarterback questions is a team with a lot of questions . There are some concerns , too , at tight end . But in the half-full glass category , there are 10 defensive starters back , two first-rate linemen in offensive linemen Anthony Cesario and Mike Newell , and above all , Damon Washington and fellow back Kevin McDougal . Naturally , Washington says he thinks the Rams can win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due time . " But whether due time means this time will require more time to find out . Regardless , another defensive coach , Thurmond Moore , says , " We 're at the bottom of the pyramid now and working our way up . We have a very solid base . " Pyramids with solid bases do n't crumble for centuries . There 's a sign leading from the Rams locker room that reads : " Attitude - a little thing that makes a big difference . " That is central to the good times around CSU because while it never will have the best players or the best facilities or the most fans or easy-flowing money , it definitely can have a mind-set that if effort ca n't conquer everyone else , it can at least defeat many who lack it . <p> A permanent Top 20 fixture ? When a recent drive to raise $ 8 million to build and improve athletic facilities drew only $ 4.5 million , the students voted to pay the remaining $ 3.5 million . Marvels Lubick , " I 'll bet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the students would vote a new building for their athletes . " But as the Rams are being showered with progress and adulation , it is Lubick who keeps things perfectly grounded . He readily admits the WAC is " not the SEC Southeastern Conference or the Big 12 . Maybe our top team can beat their third- or fourth-place team , but it 's a big difference . " When asked if his team is becoming a permanent fixture in the Top 20 , he shakes his head : " I think that would be difficult . The last three years , we 've been knocking at the door of the Top 20 , which means we 're winning , six , seven , eight games a year . That 's good for me - but maybe not for the fans . " Explains Gary Ozello , " Sonny has such a good grasp on who he is and what this program is . He remembers who we are . We are Colorado State and what we are trying to be is the best that Colorado State can be . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the NFL . Example : CSU 's brilliant QB last year , Moses Moreno , who led the Rams to new levels , was the 232nd player selected in this year 's pro draft . But what the NFL thinks is n't the point . What matters is what 's going on with the Rams in Fort Collins , and it 's very , very good . Lubick sits back , smiles the look of a contented man , and says , " At CSU , we 're still small enough to have fun . " <p> * Douglas S. Looney 's e-mail address is : looneyd@csps.com
