When her husband leaves her for another woman , Maggie finds herself thinking of her first love , whose heart she broke more than 25 years before Dare she call to ask for his forgiveness. . . and maybe something more ? Photograph <p> It is n't always just before you die that your whole life flashes before your eyes . For some people , there comes a day when every dream they 've ever had rises up anew in rebellion against the life they 've been living . This is what happened to Maggie Mary McIntyre while she was rifling through a box , in search of a term paper she 'd written more than 25 years earlier on the Irish poet W.B. Yeats . She had promised one of her students , a young woman who was also doing a paper on Yeats , that she would look for it among the boxes of old school papers in her attic . Magic had left her father and his wife , Vivian , sipping coffee in the parlor of her Victorian house on Beauchemin Street in Kansas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boxes marked COLLEGE PAPERS , 1965-69 . She expected to unearth yellowed pages of words written during her years at Boston University , before graduate school , before marriage and two children . But instead , her hand touched something soft and fragile hidden beneath a pile of old letters . It was a frayed handkerchief with a white lace border , given to her by the first boy she had ever loved : sweet Robert Flaubert . It was then that Maggie had what she might have described to her students as a real epiphany- " a sudden revelation of the essential nature of a thing , person , or situation . " It was hardly the day for it , what with her father and Vivian about to end their visit and needing a lift to the airport , and her students waiting to take their final exam in World Literature . But that 's when it happened : She saw her whole life flash before her , and with sudden new insight , she made an unexpected decision . She would go in search of her younger self @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future had stretched before her . She would go to Canada , to that lovely lake where the Harvest Moon dance hall hugged the shores , where she 'd worked for three summers as a waitress . She would go back to where she 'd made her first great mistake-breaking Robert Flaubert 's heart-and maybe then she would know what her next move in life could be , should be . Because for so long now , she had n't been really living ; she 'd merely been existing . She heard the flutter of birds on the eaves and , fur the first time in almost a year , she felt safe , in control . The house seemed to he wrapped around her like a pair of god solid arms , protecting her . And why should n't it ? After all , this was the hose that she and her handsome new husband , Joe McIntyre , had joyfully bought in 1970 , and it had protected them from wind , rain , and snow for more than 20 years . This was the house that they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This was the house to which Joe had returned each evening from his law firm , his head swimming with precedents and briefs , and , in the end , with images of the pretty paralegal who finally convinced him that he could be young again in her arms . tip until that point , until just nine months ago , the house had been Maggie 's fortress against the world . Then the paralegal changed all that . Joe asked Maggie if he could talk to her , and she knew by the tension in his face that something was terribly wrong . tier mind had raced to the most horrible possibility : Something had happened to Diana or Lucy . But it had n't . The girls were safe in their respective cities , in the tiny apartments they shared with roommates . Instead , it was Maggie and Joe who were in peril . Maggie had sat before the fire that early fall afternoon in their lovely parlor and listened as Joe unraveled the tapestry of their lives together . " I 'm in love with someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm so very , very sorry . But I want a chance to start over . I want to lead another life . " She could say nothing for a minute , sitting there before the fire . She kept her eyes on Joe as he hovered by the mantelpiece , looking sheepish , almost . She waited until he returned her stare . " I wonder if you know what you 've done , " she said , " if you can ever realize ... " Then she 'd poured herself a glass of sherry , put another chunk of wood on the fire , and sat quietly while Joe packed the things he could n't do without-she not being one of them . Before he left , he put a hand on her shoulder , as if that would ease the pain ! Then he 'd slipped out the front door . So it was that after nine months of sleepless nights , endless days , and empty holidays , she 'd come to the attic to have her great epiphany . With the brush of her fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a young woman who was a part of everything , who 'd been forgotten . She was Margaret Marv Patterson , who was , before she met and married Joe . McIntyre , before she became a mother to Diana and Lucy , a girl with hopes , dreams , and a limitless future , a girl who found her first true love when she drove her blue Volkswagen up to Canada , to Little Bear Lake in Ontario . An aunt who had vacationed there found her the job at the Harvest Moon , and , looking back , Maggie now knew that those three summers , all those days and nights spent with Robbie , had laid the foundation for the woman she might have become , should have become . THE SUMMER OF 1969 , WHEN SHE TURNED 21 , HAD BEEN THE BEST of her life . And then she had gone hack to Boston to get her master 's degree , rereading Robbie 's letters on the long nights when she could n't sleep , admiring the nature drawings he had included with each letter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In October , her second month at grad school , her brother , Douglas , stepped on a live mine in Vietnam 's Mekong Delta and disappeared in fragments . This had broken the spell of innocent youth for Maggie , and she had never again been able to retrieve it . In November , deeply grieving the loss of her only brother , she had met Joe at a football game . He was in his last year of law school . Joc had been sort of a substitute brother , a lovely comfort . He even looked a little like I Dougie with blondish hair , light brown eyes , and a demeanor more bookish than athletic . She had sent Robbie one last letter-short , friendly , apologetic . She should have done better by him , done more . But she was living in a country at war , she told herself , and hardships happen . Losses . Fast good-byes . Several months later , she and Joe were married . In 1985 , tragedy struck again when a laundry truck went out of control and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , her father had married a nice , quiet woman named Vivian . Now the two of them were waiting for her downstairs , ready to return to their own home in Boston , not knowing that she had found a lace handkerchief and opened up a Pandora 's box of memories . Her mind made up , she pulled out Robbie 's letters and put the lid back on the box . She had money in her savings account , and she knew where she could get more . She would sell the house , something she should have done months earlier for her own sense of sanity . She would take a year 's sabbatical from the university . Perhaps Robbie was still there at Little Bear Lake , and she could apologize to him in person . Maybe he 'd never married . Or maybe , like her , he was divorced . There were a million maybes , all of them wrapped up with that person she might have been . Most importantly , she would rethink her own journey down life 's highway . IN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow , and the geese were gliding through the sky in long sweeping formations , Maggie flew from Kansas City to Toronto . There , she loaded into a rented car two bulging suitcases and the box of her most beloved books and headed north for Little Bear Lake . Later , she could have more books shipped , her winter clothing , and some paintings that were especially dear to her . For the time being , a storage warehouse in Kansas City held the treasures that had once filled her home , the house that was now up for sale under Joe 's watchful eyes . " I 'll call you as soon as an offer comes in that I think we ca n't turn down , " he 'd told her . Maggie knew the deal would be a good one with Joe in charge , especially since he had a 50 percent interest in the outcome . Good hands . The same hands that took care of his new wife , Bridget . Maggie hoped that when it was over and the house was gone , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again for a long time . The roads grew more narrow after she left the highway , and Maggie grew more at ease , feeling her old world peeling away behind her . She saw the Harvest Moon sign first , and then the building , a gray mountain of wood and stone , rising before her . It had been a quarter of a century since she had seen it last . Now , the win  --  dows were boarded up . Bricks , fallen from the chimney , lay on the ground like small red blocks . Goldenrod had claimed most of the backyard , and wild yellow mustard careened through what used to be the wide front lawn . " The wide , encircling veranda had begun to sag , a concession to gravity and the millions of footfalls that had trod upon it . Dried grass and hay poked from beneath the caves , indicating that swallows had taken up residence . Maggie got out of the car . She did n't realize until she reached the front door that her eyes were wet with tears . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagined that the moon would wait for her , that one day she would return and it would open its arms to her again . Brigadoon in the Canadian wilderness But had n't the centuries-old proverb taught her that time waits for no man ? She pressed her face against the window . There was the long curving bar , the varnished pine walls , and the wagon-wheel chandelier.The wooden tables and chairs were piled in one corner . The canoe paddles , which had belonged to Gil Clarke , the owner , were still hanging on the wall behind the bar . How many times had she finished her night shift and changed into a swimsuit so that she and Robbie could jump into Gil 's canoe and paddle out for a swim ? It was n't until she left the porch that she saw the sign on a pole in the drive , twisting in the wind : FOR SALE BY OWNER , 702-6642 . Gil Clarke and his wife , Maudy , had to he in their mid-70s by now , if they were still alive , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did , for that would explain why the dance hall had been closed down . It took a lot of energy to run a bar . As she jotted down the number on a piece of paper , Maggie decided that what she needed now was a shower at the motel and a hot dinner . Then she had some phone calls to make , and some old voices to hear again . As she walked down the drive , a car slowly approached and braked in front of her . " If you 're looking for food , dear , you need to go on down to Cindy 's Cafe , " said the elderly woman in the passenger 's seat . She pointed in the direction of Fort Wallace . Maggie smiled . Gil and Maudy Clarke ! They did n't remember her , but the last time she had seen them , she 'd been 21 . Her face had n't yet settled into the look of middle-age . " We used to own this place , " Gil said . " But it got too much for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . " Maudy was peering up at her with growing interest . " Have we met before ? " she asked . " Yes , " said Maggie . " We sure have , Maudy . A lot of years ago . " " Oh , my heavens , " Maudy said with sudden recognition . " Gil , it 's little Maggie Patterson , all grown up ! " " Maggie ? " Gil looked at her more carefully . Then he smiled . There must he something in the air , " said Maudy . " Guess who else is back , visiting from Toronto ? " Maggie felt her heart give a little thump , in the hope that it would be Robbie . " Claire Findley , " said Maudy . " She 's staying at her mother 's . " CLAIRE , MAGGIE DISCOVERED WHEN SHE spoke with her on the phone an hour later , had n't changed a bit . Still wisecracking , and , Maggie would bet , the life of any party , as she 'd been when she , Maggie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their youthful summers of fun and adventure . Maggie could almost see Claire 's pretty face . She wondered if it had changed much , if perhaps she 'd lost those freckles that had peppered the bridge of her nose . " It 's wonderful to hear from you , Maggie , " Claire said . Maggie felt a tightness in her throat . Why had n't she at least written to Claire Because Claire had been Robbie 's best friend , that 's why , she told herself . Cutting him off had somehow meant she had to cut off Claire too . " So it 's still Claire Findley ? " she asked . " Well , it is now , " said Claire . " But that 's a long story . I heard years ago that you 're no longer Maggie Patterson , though . How 's the hubby ? " " An even longer story , " said Maggie . " I 've got a long time to listen , and it 's only eight o'clock , " said Claire . " We can drive over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you still drink beer ? " " Indeed , I do . " Maggie said . They arranged to meet at a small bar called the Lakeview , which sat at the tip of another lake in the headed chain that sprawled across the Canadian timberlands . As Maggie drove the 20 miles from Little Bear Lake to Fort Wallace , she remembered those balmy summer evenings when she and Robbie would drive the winding , gravelly back roads , listening to their favorite hit songs on a Toronto radio station . Invariably , they would end up at Robbie 's special place , across the cove from the Harvest loon. an idyllic spot of lakeside wilderness , where the soft green moss grew like a thick blanket beneath a canopy of trees . In the summer of 1968 , Rob had talked Gil into selling him a parcel of land that included the special spot , and he had built a tiny dock there , as a surprise for Maggie . Some nights , after she had said good night to Gil and Maudy , she would cut across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wound around the lake and through the woods . It was always at the rise of a little knoll that she could catch the sound of the radio in Robbie 's pickup , playing the season 's hit songs . Sometimes , he would wait for her on the front porch of the dance hall , and they would slip into Gil 's canoe and row away . " Throughout all the years since then , this is how she remembered him best , awash in moonlight , surrounded by the silvered lake , backlit hy the stars . He had joked that , someday , he was going to write a book about those romantic , moonlit nights . Had he become a writer ? Claire would know . And soon , Maggie would have all the answers she wanted . " I NEVER DREAMED THAT I 'D SEE YOU again , " Claire said , after they 'd hugged hello and made their way to a booth . Claire had put on a few pounds , but she was still the same , with the freckles across her nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the bandannas she had worn in the sixties . " You have n't changed a bit , " said Claire . " You have n't even gained weight . That 's not fair . " " I have to run four miles a day , " said Maggie . Their beers arrived , and they tapped the cold bottles together in a toast . " Here 's to time , " said Claire , " and old friendships . " " So , tell me about yourself , " said Maggie . " Well , I married a man named Charles Blakeley in 1974 , and we had two children , " Claire said . " We were divorced ten years later , but I married again in 1986 . That lasted only a year . We were both on the rebound . A chimpanzee would have been alert to the problems of marriage by then , but guess what I did ? In 190 , I married another man , named Christopher Dean . I loved him , but I 'd wake up in the night , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big smile on his face , his arms hugging his pillow . This last time around really hurt . " " I 'm sorry , " said Maggie . " My girls are both in college now . So I thought coming back here to stay for awhile might be a way to get my train back on the right track , so to speak . There are good men out there . I just need to learn how to pick them instead of the bad ones . " " I guess you could say I 'm here for many of the same reasons you are , " Maggie said . " One day last year my husband told me about a new love in his life-a twenty-seven-year-old paralegal in his law office . So now I 'm selling my house , and I 've taken a sabbatical from my teaching job at the university . I have no idea what I 'll be doing in a month , but , for now , I have some loose ends to tie up . And Robert Flaubert is one of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of them ? " Maggie nodded . " I want to tell him to his face that I 'm sorry and set things straight . Then I can start over again . That 's why I 'm dying to hear about him . Where is he ? Is he married ? Is he happy ? Does he live here , or did he move away " Oh , jeez , " Claire said . " You do n't know , do you ? " She looked across the table at Mae , ie. " lie never left town , " she said . " He got married in 1970 to a girl he met over in Coreyville , named Julia . I believe he loved her very much , and he adored the one son they had . " " Where is he now ? " Maggie asked . Claire looked out the window in the direction of Little Bear Lake , as if she could , see Robbie . " I saw him last five years ago when I 'd come home for a visit . We rented a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was wonderful . I went back to Toronto , and a week later my mother called to tell me Robbie had died of a heart attack . " Stunned , Maggie sat across from her old friend and tried hard to believe what she was hearing . It had never occurred to her that Robert Flaubert , who in her mind 's eye still looked just as he had when she 'd last seen him , might no longer be somewhere she could talk to him or touch him . He was gone , lost forever . " I 've got to get out of here , " she said , her legs wobbly when she stood . " I 'm coming with you , " said Claire . Maggie held out a hand . " No , " she said . " Please . Tomorrow let 's have lunch . We can talk more then . Right now , I want to be alone . " " Welcome home , sweetie , " Claire said softly . MAGGIE HAD BROUGHT WITH HER THE bundle of letters that she 'd found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the autumns , winters , and springs they 'd spent apart . On the flight to Toronto , she had picked up the first letter , dated September 9 , 1997 , and read it , as she had not been able to do in all the years that she 'd lived on Beauchemin Street . And while she read , she was flying back to the past with the intention of paying it the respect it deserved , because the past had shaped her forever . In her motel room , Maggie read the second letter Robbie had sent her , and then the third , fourth , and fifth . She read into the night , setting aside the sketches of flowers , insects , and trees that he had always included with his letters . She read until she heard the birds begin to stir in the trees . The memories had come flooding back to her-the frantic evenings of waitressing , the big dance floor packed with bodies , the tips piling up on her tray , the looks she 'd catch from Robbie as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had promised Claire that she would be all right , that she just needed time to deal with the news . That was true . After all , Robbie had been out of her life for more than 25 years . But that fact did n't help the pain of losing him after feeling so close to him again . Tomorrow she would go look for their secret spot and see if any of the dock was left . In the meantime , she cried until her pillow was wet with tears of regret . I deserve this , she told herself before she finally slept . At noon , she met Claire at Cindy 's Cafe , as they 'd arranged . " You look like hell , " Claire said . " Did n't you get any sleep ? " A waitress appeared with coffee and little tubs of milk . " Are you eating ? " asked Claire . " A salad , " said Maggie , although it was only the knowledge that she should put something in her stomach that pushed her to order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I wish there had been a better way to tell you about Rob . " " There 's no good way , " said Maggie . She watched the waitress wipe a table near the window and arrange jars of condiments . Finally , she looked at Claire . " I 'd like to know , " she said . " Did he ever mention my name ? " Claire sighed . " Of course , " she said . " But you know Robbie . He never wanted anyone to know how hurt he was by your desertion . " Maggie smiled sadly . That would be Robbie , his pride firmly on his sleeve . " Your aunt ... she came back every summer for a few years . " " Aunt Rachel . She was the one who told me about the Moon in the first place . " " As soon as she checked into her cabin , Robbie would pull me aside and say , " Could you find out about Maggie ? " That 's how we knew you 'd married a lawyer the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got married himself . Then we heard you 'd had two babies . And then , your aunt stopped coming . Robbie built a nice home on the lake and set about raising his son . I went off to Toronto . " " What happened to his wife ? " Maggie asked . She was surprised to feel a warm flash-was it jealousy ? - wash through her . But how could she blame Julia ? She 'd obviously known a good man when she 'd found one . " A few months after Robbie died , she moved about eighty miles from here to the town where she was raised , " Claire answered . " Her family is still there , and I guess it made her too lonesome to stay here , knowing how Rob loved this lake . " " His son ? " Maggie asked . What would his child be like ? " He 's still here , living in the house Robbie built , " Claire said . " I heard he was tom up over his father 's death . He 'd been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robbie died , the hoy dropped out of school and began keeping to himself . " " A forester ? " Maggie smiled . Claire smiled too . " Robbie probably could have become a writer , hut the call of the woods and the lakes was too strong for him . " Maggie nodded . She wanted to ask , " Did he ever forgive me , Claire ? " But she could n't , not yet . She ordered a second cup of coffee and said , " I guess you could say I 've been living Plan A for the last twenty-five years . But now I have a Plan B. Do you want to hear it ? " Claire nodded . " I 'm going to buy the Harvest Moon and reopen it . So , you better air out your dancing shoes . " " Are you kidding ? " Claire asked . " No , " said Maggie . " I 've already called Gil . We have an appointment with his banker this afternoon . It 'll take a bit of time to finalize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , considering we 're old friends . After all , I only have about five weeks before the harvest moon . And I want that to be my opening night . I want to attend one more Harvest Moon dance before I die , even if Robbie wo n't he there . But the Moon will be a little different this time around . No dining , just dancing and cocktails . " Claire grinned . " You 'll need a good bartender , " she said . " So consider this an application submitted right now . While you were lecturing classes about Shakespeare , I was learning how to mix the perfect Bloody Mary . " " Consider it accepted , " said Maggie . They sat for another minute , silently watching the smooth waters of the lake . " Twenty-five years , " Claire mused . " And here we are , back where we started . " " It 's about time , " said Maggie . THE REPAIRS TO THE MOON WOULD BE mostly cosmetic-Gil and Maudy had kept it in fine repair right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considering that Maggie was planning the grand opening for September 23 , a Saturday night that would also mark the autumnal equinox . She had placed an ad in The Little Bear Weekly for someone who could act as a foreman and take charge of the renovation , then stay on as the Moon 's caretaker and handyman . The paper would appear on the stands in a couple of days . In the meantime , she bought herself a car and enlisted Claire to help her clean and paint the second-floor living quarters . To make the small onebedroom apartment feel like a home , she bought a new cherry desk , lamps , a thick Persian rag , and several plants . Within a few days , the apartment felt cozy and livable . She lit scented candles , filled thebathtub with hot water and bubble bath , and sank down into the suds . After a good soak , she pulled on her favorite pair of flannel pajamas and got into bed to read . The evenings were already beginning to grow chilly , but she decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lake . She must have dozed off , because ir was almost one o'clock when she awoke , her book nn her chest , the chill of the lake seeping into the room . Music was coming from somewhere off the water . Annoyed , she wondered who was playing music at this hour . Her irritation was immediately followed hy amusement . How many middle-aged people had opened their windows on those long-ago summer nights and been disturbed by Robbie 's radio ? The sound of the phone woke her at ten . She stumbled out to the tiny kitchen and prepared her coffee . " I , hen she pushed the replay button on her answering machine and heard Claire 's voice : " Call me the instant you get this message ! You wo n't believe who I just ran into . Call , it 's urgent ! " Maggie ; ir poured a cup of coffee and was about to phone Claire when she heard a car . From the kitchen window , she saw a dark-green pickup truck pulling into the drive . Claire would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outdoor staircase that led to her little apartment , turned the corner of the building , and stopped in her tracks . She felt the coffee cup falling from her hand , and the world spinning beneath her , as everything she knew and believed fell away . " I 'm still asleep , and this is a nasty dream , " she whispered . Because there was Robert Flaubert , standing before her , as real as flesh and hone . When he smiled , she felt a cry rise in her throat . Robbie , dear Robbie ! " Did I frighten you ? " he asked , bending to pick up the broken pieces of her coffee cup . Maggie could say nothing . It was Robbie 's smile , voice , brown eyes , and black silk- hair . But this was the hoy she remembered from years ago . This could n't be the man who had died of a heart attack at 46 . This tall , handsome young man had to be Robbie 's son . " I just stopped hy to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I 'm Eliot Flaubert . " He had named his son Eliot ! How many nights had they spent choosing names for the children they might one day have ? " Ff it 's a girl , we 'll call her Robbie . Junior , to make her tough , " Robbie had joked . " And if it 's a hoy , we 'll call him Eliot , after your favorite poet . Because with a name like that , he 'll have to learn to he tough too . " " Eliot ? " she finally said , her legs rickety beneath her . " I scared you , " he said . " I 'm sorry . I guess you are n't used to visitors yet , considering you 're still not open . " He smiled Robbie 's crooked smile that meant he was only half serious . " I 'm hoping the job of foreman is still available . " Maggie nodded . " It 's still open . Bit how 'd you know about it ? " he paper is n't out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cup on the sidewalk and brushed his hands on his jeans . He looked even taller than his father . " I met an old friend of my father 's at the cafe about an hour ago , " he said . " She told me . " " Claire ? " asked Maggie and remembered her phone message : You wo n't believe who I ran into . " She told me you were his friend , too , and that you three used to have a lot of fin together . " Maggie finally recovered enough to put her hand out to Eliot . He took it in his own big hands , strong and durable like Robbie 's . " We were very good friends , " she said . " And we miss your father a great deal . I had hoped to see him again . I did n't know about .... " She realized she was treading upon fragile ground . " If I had known you were looking for a job , " she said , changing the subject , " I could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's Ed charging these days ? Two bucks ? Or has it gone up ? " Maggie laughed . " See how much I need a good jack-of-all-trades ? Ed must have seen me coming a mile off , city slicker that I am . He charged me five bucks . " Eliot smiled , his dark eyes sparkling . " You 'll make it tip next summer . Ed always plants too many vegetables . You 'll get it back in zucchini alone . " She felt a warmth rise in her heart . She was sensing Robbie 's wit alive in his son . " The job is yours , Eliot , " she said . " Do you want a cup of coffee ? " He shook his head and smiled . " No , thanks . I ca n't stand around drinking coffee . I have work to do . ( Claire says you expect to open on the harvest moon . " With that , he walked back to his pickup , his body moving with the same sure stride as Robbie 's . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Is it all right if I set up a charge account for you at Bagley 's I Hardware and the Little Bear Lumberyard ? They 'll trust you if I tell them it 's okay . " Maggie nodded . Then she stood in her bare feet and watched as the dark green pickup drove away in a flurry of dust . FIVE DAYS LATER , CLAIRE STOOD READing the list Maggie had made up of things that needed doing . " You 're ordering these records for the jukebox ? " she asked , arching her eyebrows . " That 's right , " said Maggie , who was varnishing the shelves behind the bar . " You see a problem ? " Outside , Eliot could be heard giving instructions to the two workers he had hired to repair a damaged section of the roof The Moon was beginning to look shipshape and rejuvenated . Gil and Maudy had stopped in earlier to see how they were progressing . They had left glowing . " It 's almost like the old days , " Maudy had said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had laughed heartily . " We 've got just a few years left until we kick fifty , " she said . But Maudy was unconvinced . " Fifty seems young to me these days , and with all this bustle , and Eliot here , well , it is like the old days . " Now , Claire was focused on the list of records . " These choices seem unusual , " she was saying . " " Blue Moon " by The Marcels . " You Send Me " by Sam Cooke . " Some Enchanted Evening " by Ezio Pinza . And " Stranger in Paradise " by " Tony Bennett . They are n't exactly current . " " Oh , we have plenty of room for current songs , too , but these are special . " " Mmmm , " Claire said , tucking the list inside her jacket . " They 're special all right . They 're Robbie 's favorite songs from when he first met you . " Maggie replaced the lid on the can of varnish . When the shelves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Are n't you going to be late for your haircut appointment ? " she asked , avoiding the issue . Claire probably raised her eyebrows again , but Maggie turned away before she could see . Moments later , she could hear Claire telling Eliot something in the front yard , and then she drove away . The next moment , she heard Eliot 's step in the doorway . " I want you to see something , " he said . She turned slowly to look at him . Ever since he 'd come into her life , she could n't turn to face him quickly , for if she did , her breath would catch in her throat , and she could say nothing until the shock of seeing Robbie in him passed . And her discomfort with him was n't just because he reminded her of his father . Something else unnerved her : Eliot seemed to know her , treating her with such familiarity that one would think they had been acquaintances for years . " What ? " she asked . " It 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , side by side . The early September day , Maggie noticed , was magnificent . Across the road , where a small field lay along the edges of heavy forest , a crow called from the top of a high tree . Gulls cried on the lake . Squirrels scurried across the ground , and the leaves had begun to turn bright orange and red . They stopped at the end of the drive . " I thought it might be nice to put up the stone wall again , " Eliot said . It was lovely . He had rebuilt the small stone fence that had edged the front of the property . The wall now looked just as it had when Maggie first pulled up to it on a June day in 1967 . " Thank you , Eliot , " she said . " It looks as good as new . " " I had to move a nest out of one of the openings , " he told her . " But it was abandoned , so I guess it was okay . " Maggie smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frogs crossing the road and snakes slithering onto the tar . " Who am I to decide their time is up ? " he 'd say . " Thanks again , Eliot , " she said . " It was a wonderful idea . " And then she turned away , ignoring the need she sensed in him to talk . " Wait till Maudy sees the wall , " he called after her . " She 'll want me to run for mayor . " Maggie stopped and looked back . In the autumn sun , his black hair shone like a crow 's wing . He was sitting on the wall , his long legs thrust out before him , crossed at the ankles . She would have known that he was Robert Flaubert 's son had their paths crossed in any airport , in any dimly lit restaurant . " If Maudy wants you to run for mayor , " she said , " I suggest you do it . With her on your side , you 'll win . " Then she walked on , knowing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WENT OUT TO find the trail that led around the lake to Robbie 's special spot . Claire had told her that as far as she knew , the land had belonged to Robbie at the time of his death . At first , the path seemed to be blocked by a tangle of bushes , but she found alternative trails and finally managed to scale the small hill that would lead her down to the special spot . It was at this crest that she 'd usually heard Robbie 's music . Now , she heard the wind stirring the crisp leaves of the birch trees . She descended the hill , and there was the mossy blanket just as it had been in the glorious summers past . The special spot seemed to have remained untouched . But how was that possible ? She found the answer when she made her way to the little dock and saw that repairs had been made over the years . Someone was keeping this place alive , as though it were a garden . And Maggie suspected that it was Eliot Flaubert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her the face of her first true love . But this time , when he turned to her in the canoe , bathed in moonlight , his hair was longer , his face a bit thinner , his smile more mischievous . Even in the thick gauze of her dreams , she knew she was seeing Eliot , not Robbie . THE FOLLOWING WEEKS PASSED QUICKly . The renovations progressed well . The work on the roof was finished . The dance floor still needed to be painted and varnished , but a band from Coreyville , highly recommended by locals , had already been hired . Just four days before the Harvest Moon Dance , which would also mark the grand reopening of the Harvest Moon , Maggie officially took over the place . After several trips to Gil 's banker in Coreyville , numerous phone calls , and neat financial statements , the sale became final . Thanks to Fred 's Electronics in Lakeview , the jukebox was playing again , and would be kept busy Saturday night during band breaks . Maggie 's special record orders still had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coreyville , had promised to stop and check on them . It had been a long day . Maggie and Claire had eaten quick sandwiches for supper and then finished unpacking the glasses , lining them up on the shelves behind the bar . " Okay , Cinderella , " Claire said to Maggie at eight o'clock . " We need to celebrate the fact that Maggie Patterson , former waitress , now owns the best dance hall this side of ... well , somewhere . " Maggie , who was on her knees beneath the bar , arranging boxes of straws , had to agree . Her feet hurt , and it seemed like a good idea to stop for the night . She got herself and Claire a couple of cold beers , then slumped down onto a bar stool . " I like the notion of records instead of CDs in a jukebox , " she said , watching Claire pump quarters into the machine and make her selections . " Me too , " Claire said . " But , you know , if you want the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to order some new records . I told Eliot to select a bunch . I hope you do n't mind . " Maggie shook her head . She was thankful that Claire had thought of it . She 'd been too busy signing the final papers . " We 'll christen the fireplace tomorrow night , " Maggie said . " It 's getting cold enough for a fire in the evenings . " She tilted her beer back and took a drink . " Eliot asked me today why you avoid him , " Claire said suddenly . Caught off guard , Maggie hesitated , then realized she could n't fool Claire . " It 's still so difficult . " " It 's like looking at and listening to Robbie all over again , " said Claire . " And it seems as if he knows me , Claire . It 's eerie . Like he inherited Robbie 's memories of me . " " That 's interesting , " said Claire , " but impossible . Hey , look at this ! Maudy 's still got " Theme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if there are any grooves left on the record . " Maggie frowned . " Please , do n't play it . I 'm too tired for any serious memories tonight . " Claire finished making her selections , took a sip of beer , and grinned at Maggie . " I sometimes feel that my history can be charted by what was on the pop charts when the greatest events in my life happened , " she said . Maggie smiled . " Robbie used to say that loving a good song was better than going to a good psychiatrist . It 'll probably do you more good-and cost less . " Claire nodded , and they were silent for a minute , remembering Robbie and how he loved words and music . A car door slammed outside , and Maggie turned to look . " Gil must be back for another inspection . " She was about to shout , " We 're in here , Gil ! " when Eliot appeared in the doorway . " Ladies , " he said . " Can I interest you in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise ? I think it 's in our professional interest to make sure it 's starting to turn full for Saturday night . " " Hey , handsome ! C'm on over and get yourself a fresh tier , " Claire called out to him . She nudged Maggie . " Let 's go . " So Maggie found herself moving the way she would in the old days , tired from an evening of waitressing , headed toward Robbie and a night on the lake . She walked out the door past Eliot , noticing the smell of his shaving lotion , and his muscled arms , tan from being out in the sun supervising the roof repairs . " There 's the moon , " he said . And there it was-an orange ball climbing up over the mountain on the opposite side of the lake , looking almost full . " It 's breathtaking , " Maggie said , as she and Claire followed him to the water 's edge . " My dad used to take me fishing on this lake , " Eliot said . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If you had binoculars , you could see our house-my house-over there . " Maggie turned and looked up into Eliot 's black eyes , and then she reached out and touched his arm . He looked back at her with such intensity that she felt her face flush . On the lake , the loons called their haunting , melancholic music . " The loons will be hibernating any day now , " said Eliot . " I 'll hate to see them go , " said Maggie . She felt exuberant now , looking back at the Moon . " Let 's have a nightcap on the veranda , " she suggested . " It 'll be a bit chilly , but we 're tough . We 'll drink cognac to christen the Moon , and that will keep us warm . " " Perfect idea , " said Claire . " I knew the old Maggie would show up sooner or later . " MAGGIE WENT UPSTAIRS TO GET SWEATERS for herself and Claire . " Where 's Eliot ? " she asked when she returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something inside that he 'd ordered for the bar , " Claire said . " He 'll be right out " They wrapped themselves in the sweaters and sat staring at the lake . The moon seemed more orange as it rose , the evening sky growing darker around it " You might think we 'd stepped inside a time machine , " said Claire . " I do n't even feel those extra twenty pounds tonight " Maggie laughed . " We could market that kind of time machine . The Time Warp Diet " " Ready for a toast ? " asked Eliot as he came outside to join them . He lifted his cognac , and Claire and Maggie did the same . " Well ? " asked Claire , as their three glasses clicked . " Here 's to old friends , " said Eliot . " And here 's to the best fisherman , woodsman , guide , philosopher , sometime writer , and all-time father that ever lived . " Maggie felt her eyes grow moist . She had come back to tell Robbie she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it were possible . Helping his son might be the next best thing . " Here 's to Robert Flaubert , " said Maggie . " Here 's to Robbie , " said Claire . She finished her cognac , then said , " Oh ! What time is it ? " " Only a little after ten , " said Maggie . Claire bounded up . " I 'll see you guys tomorrow I promised my mother I 'd pick her up at Bingo , which is over at ten . " " You 're late , " said Eliot . " Naw , " Claire said . " Mom and her friends stand around afterward and talk about how the ladies from Coreyville cheat . " Maggie smiled , but she felt uncomfortable . She was n't ready for Claire to leave . She had just gotten used to having Eliot there in Robbie 's stead . Claire patted the top of Maggie 's head as she left . " Save me a cup of coffee in the morning . " And then she was gone . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maggie nodded . They sat for some time , watching the moon , listening to the sounds of the night . " It 's getting cold out here , " Eliot said , finally breaking the silence . " How about another cognac at the bar ? If you think I 've had too much , I 'll swim home . " " I guess I can trust you for one more , " Maggie said . Inside , at the bar , she poured their drinks , then took a stool next to Eliot 's , trying hard not to meet his eyes . She felt the same discomfort she 'd experienced when Claire had left . She knew now what it was : She wanted desperately to reach out and hug Eliot , to hold him close to her . Suddenly , as if reading her mind , Eliot placed his warm hand over hers . She felt a shiver nm up her arm . " Do you avoid me because I remind you of my father ? " For a moment , she said nothing . Outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leaves rustling . " Yes , " she finally admitted . " You remind me very much of your father . " " Another toast , " he said and lifted his cognac . " I consider it an honor that I remind you of Robert Flaubert , but here 's to us . Here 's to now . " Maggie raised her glass and touched it to his . Then she said : " Your father used to own a piece of land across the lake . Who owns it now ? " " I do , " said Eliot , watching her closely . What does he expect I 'll say , ? she wondered . Does he know the truth about the special place ? " It was one of my father 's favorite spots . We fished there . " " I noticed the dock , " she said . " Would you like to go there ? " Maggie nodded . " One day this week . " " I know you 're tired , " he said . " But before I go , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to the jukebox , slipped a quarter into , it and punched out a selection . The he recrossed the room and pulled her off the stool onto the dance floor . " Eliot , " she said . " It 's getting late . " " One dance , " he insisted . " This is my surprise to end an evening of celebration . " The music started . It was " Some Enchanted Evening , " and Maggie felt her legs weaken , but Eliot 's solid arms were around her , holding her tight to his chest . They moved slowly around the floor , and suddenly it felt the way it used to when the Moon was packed with people and the jukebox was blasting . On those summer nights , Robbie always smelled of shaving lotion and lake water and open air . He and Maggie had first locked eyes across the dance floor . That was why he had so loved the song . She raised her head and felt Eliot 's lips touching hers . He lifted his hands from around her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He kissed her again . Then he pulled back to look at her , smoothing away strands of hair . " From the moment I saw you , " he said , " so nervous you spilled your coffee , I 've been wanting to hold you . " She moved back , away from him , retreating behind the bar . " It 's time to call it a night , " she said softly , pretending to be busy with the cognac bottle , recapping it , putting it back in place . Eliot moved next to her and put his hands on her arms . " This is crazy , " she said . " There 's something very wrong about this . " " How is it wrong ? " hc asked . " Do n't tell me it 's about age , because I know how I feel . " " You do n't know anything about me , " she said . She felt terror rising up in her . Part of her wanted this . But Eliot was almost half her age . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of things about you . I know you 're sometimes afraid of the dark when you wake up in the middle of the night . You love Russian plays . You hate Sundays . You once dreamed of renting a little boat and traveling the canals of England . And I know you were my father 's first love . " She leaned against the bar , steadying herself , trying to think . Then she understood . " You read the letters I wrote to Rob . " " After my father died , " he said , " my mother told me about a box of his papers from forestry school that he 'd put away in the basement . She said he wanted me to have them . Your letters were at the bottom . Did he want me to find them ? I do n't know . Nobody plans to die of a heart attack . Maybe he would have destroyed them . I only know that I found them . " " You knew about the place under the birches , " Maggie whispered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still holding her arms . Now he pulled her closer to him . " When I drove tIp here last week , I was n't jost lIx ) king for a job , " hc said . " I wanted to see Maggie Patterson . I wanted to meet the woman my father loved before he met my mother . I ' or over five years I 've wondered about voll . I 've read your letters again and again . You say I do n't know you ? I bet I know you better than anyone alive . " She tried to remember the letters , especially the last ones , after Dougie had died , letters in which she had poured out to Robbie her deepest , darkest anxieties about life and death . And now Eliot knew that side of her too . Her hands against his chest , she pusshed him away from her and said , " Eliot , the work on the M , oon is nearly finished . I think it 's best that we keep a distance , at least for awhile . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The second I saw you , Maggie , " he said , " I understood why my father could n't pass you by . Just like I ca n't . " But Maggie did n't want to hear this . All she could think was : He 's read my letters . He knows my innermost thoughts . He knows everything . " I 'm sorry , " she said . " But you must go . " His eyes on her , he backed away , left her there behind the bar . She heard the truck 's engine flare to life , pebbles spitting in the driveway . And then she watched his taillights swinging right at the lovely stone fence . AT NINE O'CLOCK ON FRIDAY MORNING , Maggie awoke to the sound of voices in the yard . She had been sleeping so soundly that she had n't heard vehicles pulling in or doors being slammed or toolboxes being hoisted about . She washed up and made coffee before she pulled the curtain aside and peered out into the yard , hoping to see Eliot 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , but what had she expected ? In the long reaches of Wednesday night , she had lain awake and wondered if she had done the right thing . That she was captivated by Eliot was now apparent to her . But he 's only two years older than Lucy , was the thought that kept running through her mind . How had it gone this far , that she was dreaming of him at night and waking with his name on her lips . It occurred to her that , perhaps , the best thing would be for him to decide not to retum On Thursday night , just a few minutes past ten , the phone had rung , and , heart hammering , she had picked it up , hoping it was Eliot-and hoping it was n't . It was Lucy . And so they had chatted , about Lucy 's classes , about the Moon . " Will you come for Thanksgiving since you ca n't make the Harvest Moon Dance ? " Maggie had asked . Lucy was noncommittal . But she would try . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maggie forgot about her own emotional conflict and concentrated on Lucy . " Honey , " she said . " Is something wrong ? " " Mom , " Lucy said flatly . " She 's pregnant . Can you believe that ? " For a moment , Maggie was n't sure whom Lucy was talking about . But she could hear anger in her voice , and Lucy would n't be angry if her sister was pregnant . Then she knew , hut , for the record , she asked , " Sweetie , who 's pregnant ? " " Bridget ! " Lucy cried . " Who else ? I 'm so embarrassed ! " Poor Lucy and Diana . They were bound for life now to Bridget . " You have nothing to be embarrassed about , " Maggie assured her . " And this is n't as bad as it seems . Imagine having a little baby around . It 'll be a whole new experience for you . " She suddenly realized that Joe would be more than 70 when this child was Lucy 's age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucy asked . Maggie had to smile Her girls were still looking out for her . " Not in the same way you do , " she said . " Do n't feel bad for me , honey . Do n't worry . It 'll be fine . " After she and Lucy had said their goodbyes , Maggie tried to honestly identify her feelings , because despite what she 'd told lcy , Joe and Bridget having a baby did bother her . Was it jealousy that Joe was starting over with someone new , and that she could n't seem to do the same ? Whatever it was , it hurt . Now , Maggie could hear Claire 's voice in the bar . On the veranda , Maudy was directing Gil in the art of hanging wind chimes , and workers were noisily exchanging instructions in one of the bathrooms . Maggie could hear them from the bar area , where she had stopped to see what ( Claire was doing . She listened for Eliot 's voice , but there was no sign of him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who peered out from behind the jukebox , which had been pulled away from its place against the wall . " You 're looking chipper this morning . " " Wish I could say the same for you , " said Claire . " You 've been sleeping well ? " Maggie shrugged . " All this grand opening excitement . " " Eliot 's not feeling well , " Claire said . " He called last night to say he was sending someone over today to take care of the bathroom fixtures . " Maggie could feel her face redden . Hoping Claire would n't notice , she went behind the bar for a glass of orange juice . But Claire was climbing a ladder near the doorwaythat led onto the dance floor , her hands full of colored leaves . " He 's probably just run-down , " she was saying . " We 've all put in a lot of hours the past couple of weeks . Oh , I put those records he ordered into the jukebox . Do n't tell him I told you , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's by Neil Young . " Maggie was thankful that Claire was rattling on in her usual fashion . Just then , Maudy and Gil walked into the bar . " Lovely morning , is n't it ? " Maudy asked , as Gil disappeared in the direction of the bathroom . " He thinks he has to oversee everything , " she whispered . " At least we 're in good hands , " said Maggie . " Claire , sweetie , " said Maudy , " are you sure you got enough veggies and fruit for the platters ? " " Yes , Maudy , " said Claire . " And the cold salads from the deli ? " " Got them . " Claire raised her eyebrows at Maggie across the top of Maudy 's gray head . Maggie shrugged , as if to say , You work it out , Claim Then she peered out into the front yard . On the lake , boaters were specks , fishermen getting in their last catches before the season closed . It was too far away to see Eliot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Was he staring back at her from a deck ? Robert would have built a deck when he built himself a house , no doubt about that . Was Eliot out there watching the boaters from his side of the lake ? Could he see the Moon from wherever he was ? AFTER THE WORKMEN HAD GONE FOR the day , and Gil and Maudy had left , Maggie and Claire sat on the veranda , sipping Irish coffees . They said nothing for a long time . Maggie was the first to speak , knowing that Claire wanted to give her time to arrange her thoughts . " What am I going to do ? " she asked , wishing her friend had an answer . " Do you have any idea what it feels like to wake up and discover that you 've fallen for your former boyfriend 's son ? " Claire shook her head . " This one 's hard to call , and I thought I could call them all . " The last piece of sun slipped behind the lake and disappeared . Maggie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pink , in just minutes . " It 's about to drive me crazy , " she said . " I 'm not sleeping , and now I 'm worried about him . " Claire finished the last of her coffee and stood up . Then she said , " Why have n't you asked me if Robbie ever forgave you ? " Maggie shrugged . " Afraid of the answer , I guess . " " Well , let me tell it to you anyway . Because maybe it 'll do you some good . He did forgive you . Do you know why I know that ? Because he started talking about you . One night , just before he married Julia , they came into the Moon together . Julia went to another table to talk to some friends , and Robbie started reminiscing about the fun the three of us had . " I wonder how Maggie is getting along , " he said . And I said , " I do n't know if Maggie is happy , but wherever she is , she 's remembering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Claire 's tone grew firmer . " You need to put this in perspective , Maggie . You and Rob were first loves , and first loves are hard to let go of sometimes . But that 's all it was , and then it was over . " " He forgave me ? " Maggie asked softly . Claire nodded . " I could have told you right away , the minute von sailed into Little Bear . I was waiting for you to ask . But Maggie , there was really nothing to forgive . You were both so young . And this is n't 1969 any longer , honey . As long as you know that , you have nothing to worry ahout : . Now , I got ta run . I-Iow about coffee in the morning , same chairs ? " Maggie nodded " Eight o'clock ? " " It 's gon na be great when the opening is over and we start sleeping until ten , " Claire said and hugged Maggie good night . After dinner , which she ate alone on one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat for a long time , sipping a glass of red wine , watching the flames " It is n't the firewood that burns , not directly , " Robbie had told her once , as the two of them had sat before this same fireplace , listening to summer rain pelt the roof . " The heat drives a gas from the wood , and when that gas combines with oxygen in the air , it ignites . " He had taught her many things about science , as well as life and human nature . But what would he say about human nature now ? What would he say if he knew how she was feeling about his son ? She left the blazing fire and stepped out onto the veranda to listen to the night . It was quiet , except for the desolate wail of an owl , echoing off the water in long quavery boots . Then her ears picked up something else : music floating to her from the little dock . She listened for a time , trying to imagine Eliot there in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moon for two days . Would he stay away forever ? She went back inside , opened the cash register , and took out a couple of quarters . Then she peered down at the selections in the jukebox . She pushed the button for " Some Enchanted Evening , " and as Ezio Pinza 's big , booming voice filled the rooms she began to dance , her arms held up before her as though she were waltzing with a ghost . When the song ended , she returned to the jukebox and looked for the Neil Young record that Eliot had ordered . There it was , the name written on a label in Claire 's neat , steady hand : " Harvest Moon . " What a perfect title for the grand opening . She pushed the buttons , and the song started , slow and sweet . Again , she danced , with tears in her eyes as she heard the words for the first time : But their 's a full moon risiin " Let 's go dancing in the light We know where the music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night Because I 'm still in love with you I want to see you dance again Because I 'm still in love with you On this harvest moon . THE DAY OF THE GRAND OPENING arrived , bringing the bluest skies Maggie could remember at Little Bear Lake . Even Mudy felt the urge to honor the event by phoning Maggie at nine o'clock , to ask if she 'd been outside yet . " It 's a made-to-order morning , " she said . " We 'll be there early today . Tell Eliot to make sure someone mows the hay along the stone fence . Gil says we 'll need extra parking spaces . " " I 'll tell him , " Maggie said . But what if he does n't show up today ? What if he does n't come to the dance ? Claire pulled into the driveway , raising dust . " Good morning , " she said . " Well ? " Maggie asked . " I 've left four messages since last night , " Claire said . " He has n't returned my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my way here . No sign of the truck . " Maggie left Claire behind the bar , working on the schedules she had set tip for the four waitresses she had hired , and walked down to the water 's edge . She looked OUt across the expanse as though it were spread before her as the future might be if you could see the future , a wide blue blanket , waiting for someone to make a mark on it . " You okay , sweetie ? " Claire called from the porch . Maggie looked down the stretch of shoreline to where the little dock pushed out into the water . " I 'm okay . " And then she turned back to the Moon , back to the busy day that lay ahead . " rhat evening , the hors d'oeuvres were a big hit , as were the autumn decorations Claire had spread throughout the bar and along the sides of the dance floor . The band from Coreyville was good , and soon the Moon was rocking with the sound of pounding feet on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their element again , passing out plates of canapes and seeing that everyone was comfortable . Claire looked frazzled but pleased behind the bar as she and the part-time bartender I drink after drink . That morning , Claire had asked laggic to consider the possibility of the two of them becoming business partners . " I could n't afford to buy this place on my own , " Claire had said , " but I could swing half , in a few months . " Maggie liked the idea of sharing the responsibility . And it looked like it was going to be a good business venture . By ten o'clock , Eliot still had n't appeared . Maggie kept scanning the room , hoping to catch a pair of black eyes above the heads of the dancers . " Have you seen him ? " she leaned in once to ask Claire , Who shook her head and went back to mixing Bloody Marys . Gil and Maudy were so husy introducing Maggic to her fellow Little Bear Lakers that they did n't seem to notice Eliot was missing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " people kept telling her . " Welcome to our community . " She would have been floating if only Eliot had been there . At a quarter to eleven , Maggic resigned herself . He is n't coming , she thougt . The hand was on its third break of the night . In the middle of a conversation with the local librarian , Maggie heard the Neil Young song . No one had played it all night , perhaps because it was already two or three years old . But now here it was , and the roar of the crowd seemed to drop away so she could hear the words . She looked instinctively toward the bar , because that was where Robbie had sat all those nights while he 'd waited for her to finish her shift . And there sat Eliot , watching her intently . Then a large group of people moved between them , and his face was gone . Saying good-bye to the librarian , Maggie made her way to the bar . By the time she got there , Eliot was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move closer . " I think you could end up in the Guinness Book of World Records for this , " Claire whispered . " Breaking two generations of hearts . I do n't think anyone has laid claim yet to that title . " " Where is he ? " Maggic asked . Claire shrugged . " I thought you hired me to sling drinks . Wherever he is , he 's in love . That 's pretty obvious . " Maggie frowned at her . And then the next song caught her attention . Eliot Pinza singing " Some Enchanted Evening , " Robbie 's old song , and she had no doubt that this time it was being played by Eliot . And there he was , staring at her from the opposite side of the room again , where she had just been . Was he playing games with her ? She smiled , but he did n't smile back . He did n't take his eyes from her as the song continued . She tried to make her way to him , but when she got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over , and the band was playing again . Couples rushed to the dance floor . Eliot was gone . " Have you seen Eliot ? " she asked Gil , who had come in from the veranda . " He just got in his truck and drove away , " said Gil . " I tried to holler to him , but he did n't hear me . Now , my girl , how 's it feel to be a club owner on a full night ? I 'll be back for a Saturday night in January , when it 's twenty-five below , and we 'll talk . " Maggie suddenly felt as if the magical night was over , now that Eliot was gone . She spent the rest of the evening conscious of the forced smile on her face . At almost one thirty , as the band was packing up , Claire whispered , " Do n't look now , but see that good-looking guy sitting at the end of the bar ? He asked me to go to Coreyville with him for breakfast . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finish . " " Go , " said Maggie . " You 've worked hard enough . " The crowd had begin to leave . Gil and Maudy , rarely up so late , came to bid Maggie good night . " Seems funny for the bar to close and us not to go up the stairs to bed , " Maudy said . " But I do love our little house in town . " The clamor of engines roared to life and people 's voices rose up in the parking lot . Then , as the noise had come , it receded like a giant wave . Maggie and two of the waitresses tended to the aftermath , mopping floors , wiping down the bar , washing glasses And then just Maggie was left , sitting at the bar . She put her aching feet up on another bar stool and sat there , surveying the huge space . Had she imagined Eliot , brooding from across the room ? " Why did n't he say hello ? " she had asked Claire . " You told him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must remember how proud Robbie was . I 'm sure Eliot is the same . I 'm surprised he came at all . " She went outside and stared at the huge orange harvest moon that had spent its evening crossing the sky over Little Bear Lake . Then she heard Eliot 's music , rising up from the special place . He was at the dock , where Robbie used to wait for her . She felt indignant . Was he playing hard to get ? Foolish , that 's what it was . She would n't play that game . She watched as dawn appeared on the horizon . The morning birds began to stir in the semidarkness . The light in the bar was still spilling yellow out of the window 's , attracting the late-season moths . Maggie watched the area of the cove where the dock jutted out into the water . He would know by the lights that she was still up . At last , she went back inside . Another song , and then she 'd be off to bed . The words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , ghostly now : Come a little bit closer Hear what I have to say Just like children sleepin " We can dream this night away . Suddenly , she was filled with longing . Outside the window , she could see fingers of daylight tracing the sky . She would n't need a flashlight . Her feet still knew the path . She had envisioned it many times , had walked it at night during her dreams . But she needed to tell herself the truth . She had wanted him to come to the dance . She had wanted him to hold her . She had wanted him to kiss her again . The grass was wet beneath her feet . Then she was descending the little hill , where the path was well-trodden , pushing past the sumac into the grove of white birches . He was sitting outside his truck on the grass near the water 's edge . In the light of dawn she could see his face as he watched her approach . " Remember how Jay Gatsby stood on the end of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reached out to touch his face . His hair was damp with dew , and when she pushed it back , it felt like strands of silk in her hands . " Yes , " she said . " I remember . " " He watched Daisy 's light across the water . " " Yes . " She leaned forward to kiss his face . It tasted wet and salty . She tried to kiss him again , but he grabbed her arms and held her away from him so that he could look at her . " I never knew till now how broken Gatsby 's heart was , " he whispered . " But yours does n't have to be , " Maggie said , closing her eyes as his arms enfolded her . SHE AWOKE THE NEXT MORNING TO guilt . She slipped on a pair of jeans and a sweater , made coffee , and took her cup down to the veranda , where she sat in the rocker and thought about Eliot Faulbert and what she would do with him . He had driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had been on a date . In the magic of the moment , it had seemed exactly as it should be . But now she had to wonder what had caused that magic in the first place . Perhaps , at first , Eliot had represented the only way she could find Robbie again . But she knew , now , that she had fallen in love with him tor himself . She could appreciate him in ways she had never appreciated Robbie , because she had n't been wise enough . She had been given a second chance . But could she take it ? " This is n't about age , " he had said " This is about love and respect . That 's all , and it 's enough . " And she 'd wanted to believe him , but now that daylight had come , she could see no way that this could work . What would her daughters think ? And Eliot 's mother ? And what about the residents of Little Bear Lake ? As much as she had tried to avoid Eliot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had come to love him , and she WOUld hate to lose him But she kept doing the math , and she wondered whether Joe had pondered this same problem . Joe had had the courage of his convictions to make the transition . She herself lacked that courage , she realized , as she sipped her coffee and waited for Eliot to return to her . " We can not do this , " she would tell him . " Too many people will be in upheaval over our falling in love . Are we prepared to pay that price , Eliot ? " Before he arrived , she phoned Claire . " Can you run Harvest Moon by yourself , with me as an absentee partner ? " she asked . Claire was predictably startled . " What the heck are you talking about ? " she demanded . " Do n't move . I 'll be right there . " But Eliot pulled up first , looking exuberant . " Good morning , beautiful , " he said , walking onto the veranda , leaning down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put it off , so she told him everything she had been thinking . " I 'm leaving Little Bear ake , " she said . " I 'm going back to Kansas City , back to university life , where things are dull-and safe . " He looked at her , almost angry . " You care what other people will think , " he said . " But what about what you think ? What about what I think ? " She wanted to tell him that an individual 's decision can affect so many lives , the way Joe 's decision had . But " I 'm sorry , " was all she could say . " I 'm disappointed in you , " he said . " I thought you were stronger . " " I guess I 'm not , " she answered . He looked out at the lake . " When are you leaving ? " he asked . " Today , " she told him . " If I do n't go now , I 'm afraid I never will . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll ask Claire to pack the rest . She 's on her way over here now . " She told him this , knowing he would leave because he would n't want Claire to catch him in such a vulnerable moment . If he did n't leave soon , she was afraid that she might try to touch him one more time . And if she touched him , it would be her undoing . Eliot pointed toward the other end of the lake . " I live there in the house mv father built , " he said . " I grew up in that house . It 'll probably be the house I 'll be living in when it 's time for me to die . " Maggie had n't wanted to cry , had promised herself she would n't , but she could n't stop herself . He reached down and grabbed her hand , pulled her up out of the rocker . He took her face in his hands and turned her head toward the end of the lake . " Over there , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where I 'll be if you change your mind . But do n't take forever , Maggie . " He went down the steps to his truck and opened the passenger-side door . Maggie watched as he rifled through the glove compartment until he found an envelope . He came back to the veranda and held it out to her . " I was going to give this to you last night at the dance , " he said . " But I changed my mind . " Then he went back to his truck , and once again , Maggie saw him turn right at the stone fence , and then he was gone . CLAIRE WAS NOT SO RESTRAINED SHE bounded up onto the veranda and found Maggie still sitting in the rocker . " I 'll tell you what this is all about . It 's about your guilt for falling in love with Eliot . For a month now , we 've all been tiptoeing around Robbie 's memory , like it 's something sacred . Well , I 'm tired of it . You once broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearts broken at least once . It 's a part of life , especially when you 're young . And here 's another bulletin you may not like to hear : Julia became the love of Robert Flaubert 's life . So do n't flatter yourself . " Maggie decided she had heard enough . She picked up her coffee cup and said , " I 'm taking just a few clothes . I 'll get Lakeview Movers to pack the rest of my things . You know very well that you can run this place by yourself . " She turned to make her way back inside . Claire could stand on the porch and rant all she wanted . She had packing to do . " I 'll tell you something else you might not know , " Claire continued . " All of Little Bear Lake already suspects something between you and Eliot , just by watching you last night . That 's how it is in little towns , Maggie . Everyone likes Eliot . And they seem to like you , too , and that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some gossip . Big deal . " Maggie waved a hand , as if to dismiss Claire . " Eliot did n't carry on like you are . " She realized , for the first time , that it bothered her that he had said so little . " Eliot is hurt , " said Claire . " I 'm angry , and that 's the difference . " She put her hand on Maggie 's arm and squeezed it . " I 'm afraid , Claire , " said Maggie . " When you 're afraid , you have to do what you think is best to protect yourself . " She looked down at the envelope in her hand and decided she would n't read it until she was safely back in Kansas City , waiting to begin another year of university classes . She might change her mind if she read it now . " I do n't get it , Maggie , " Claire said . " What are you running from ? " Maggie tried to answer her , tried to find a truth for herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready in thirty minutes , " she said . She touched a hand to her friend 's shoulder . " Was your breakfast date Mr. Right ? " Claire nodded . " You know what they say . The fiftieth time tells the story . " THE CEMETERY AT LITTLE BEAR LAKE looked like a park , set among the green of fir and spruce . Driving past it for the month she 'd been in Little Bear Lake , Maggie had n't once glanced toward the blanket of stones that covered the hillside . The reason , of course , was that one of them marked Robbie 's grave . Now , she was on her way out of town , her heart feeling as if it might burst from the weight of her decision . She was leaving Eliot , leaving Little Bear I , ake . She doubted she would ever be back here again . She found the stone in the most unexpected way . She had walked first through the older part of the cemetery , which was nicely cluttered with birches , aspens , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would feed the birds and help them sun , ive the long winter to come . Then she headed for the newer section , thinking about how the world continued to spin even as people died and were buried . What events had been taking place in her life on the day of Robbie 's death ? As she made her way up the small hill , a brilliant orange butterfly appeared , fluttering about her head , as if out of a silly Hollywood movie . Robbie had taught her to identify many butterflies during their summers together , a knowledge she had passed on to Lucy and Diana . He had left gifts behind for people lie had never even met . The buttterfly lit upon a stone , and she could tell it was a monarch , its burntorange wings traced with black veins and sprinkled with white spots . The fragile monarch , the only butterfly to annually migrate , as birds do . Then it rose straight into the air like a tiny helicopter , and Maggic saw the others , thousands of them forming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orange ribbon waved and undulated . She knew it would grow longer as it moved farther south , toward Mexico , picking up more travelers . The monarchs crested the horizon of tree tops and were gone . Feeling honored to have been given such a rare glimpse into one of nature 's cycles , she looked down and swa that the stone on which the butterfly had lit was inscibed : ROBERT FLAUBERT , BORN DECEMBER 16,1943 . DIED MAY 2 , 1990 . HERE HE LIES WHERE HE LONGED TO BE ; HOME IS THE SAILOR , HOME FROM THE SEA , AND THE HUNTER HOME FROM THE HILL . He had loved that poem , " Requiem , " by Robert Louis Stevenson , so she was not suprised to see that he had chosen it for his epitaph . As she had passed along the bank near the creek , she had broken off a srig of mountain ash beries , a bunch so dazzlingly red , they could hace been rubies . Now , she leaned forward and paced the berries on Robbie 's grave . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Good-bye , Roberto . " AN HOUR PAST TORONTO , SHE EXITED TO the highway that would carry her to Niagara Falls , where she would cross the border and begin her journey west . She stopped at a motel . She could n't drive any longer , not when her mind was so preoccupied with the past and future , with everything but the highway in front of her . She sat on the humpy bed in her room and tried to answer Claire 's question : What are you running from ? Years earlier , she had run from iler her brother 's death , straight into marriage to Joe McIntyre . She had run from her mother 's death into courses on literary criticism , the English sonnet , the medieval Latin Lyric , anything to fill her mind . She was still running , but what was she so afraid of now ? And why was she heading back to Kansas City ? " Because Kansas City is the only home I know , " she said aloud . Yet the house on Beauchemin Street was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe was in a new life . Only her world at the university remained intact . " The only home I know , " she said again to the empty room , and felt an immense sadness . She thought about the girl she had been , the one she 'd returned to Canada to find , and it brought to mind her favorite poem by Yeats : I will find out where she has gone , And kiss her lips and take her hands ; And walk among long dappled grass , And pluck till time and times are done The silver apples of the moon , The golden apples of the sun . This whole crazy journey had been because of Yeats , because of that old paper she had gone to find in her attic . She had grown to love Yeats because she knew all about those silver apples of the moon . How often had she awakened in the heart of a Kansas City night and remembered Robbie Flaubert bathed in silver moonlight . A lot of silver apples had come and gone . Would she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had felt like a college girl again in his arms . Was that so wrong ? Her motel room reminded her of the room she 'd rented in Little Bear Lake the night that Claire had told her Robbie was dead and she 'd reread his letters . Dear Mags , he 'd written . Ther 's a light wind tonight on Little Bear . It 's lonely in autumn , with everyone gone , the leaves , even the geese . She wondered whether that was how Eliot was feeling now . THE NEXT MORNING , AFTER AN UNEASY sleep , she pulled slowly into the stream of cars on the highway . She thought about Eliot . She imagined that he might wait for her until one of life 's tentacles reached out and reeled him into the bosom of another dream , with a young woman who would hear their children , who would be there for him in the heart of those lonely nights that were sure to come . Just before she crossed the border , she pulled into a picnic area and sat staring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth was that this trip did n't feel right As cars zoomed past her , she remembered something Joe had told her that day he had explained why he could no longer stay in the marriage . " I feel like I 'm being swept along by this , " he had said . " It 's like riding in a fast-moving car with no reverse . All I ca n't do is try to steer as best I can . I know I ca n't take any U-turns , Maggie . I know that once I go , I ca n't come back . This is a long stretch of straight road , but I 'm willing to suffer all the consequences . She reached into her purse and pulled out the envelope Eliot had given her . She had expected a letter from him , but what she found was a letter dated October 3 , 1969 , the letter she had sent to Robbie after her brother 's death . She had written : Already my own life has changed . I can no longer look upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than others , but we need to live fully the one we 've been given . This is Dougie 's legacy to me . We 've shared three wondrful summers together , but I 'm too young to settle down with one notion of life right now . Maybe , some day in the future , you and I will meet again . Until then , I hope that you will think of me fondly , as I will you . I now believe that love is like absolute zero , only possible in theory . But I hope that you find love , Rob . And if the day ever comes that i find it , too , I 'll grab hold of it . Life is too short and precious to do it any other way . For many long minutes , Maggie sat unmoving , the letter in her hand . How could she have remembered for all those years that she had broken up with Robbie after she had met Joe ? She had already left behind the notion of a future with Robbie , even before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school papers , the flat tires and basketball games the facts of her first romance had grown larger . Claire was right . Her episode in time with Robbie had been nothing more than a case of first love And how could she have forgotten the truths she had learned from Doug 's death ? Wen need to live fully . If the day ever comes that I find love , I 'll grab hold of it . She looked out at the road that lav before her , a road that would carry her back to the heartland of America . She eased the car into gear and pulled back onto the highway . " Once I go , " she said aloud , " I ca n't come back . " IT WAS EARLY EVENING WHEN SHE SAW the sign : wELCOME TO LITTLE BEAR LAKE , and she felt a truth in it . Earlier , she had phoned Claire from the road and said , " Your partner is on her way home . " Claire 's response was typical . " Does this mean I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " for the rest of my life ? " Maggie drove right past the Harvest Moon and kept going until she reached the place where the birches clustered together , protecting tile moss beneath them . There was no sign of Eliot . The road around the lake was bordered in brilliant trees of red , yellow , and orange . Almost overnight , autumn had arrived . Maggie would need to have a load of hardwood delivered , split , and stacked to keep the fireplace fed so it would sing to her all winter . She would need to get the dance room winterized , the old windows replaced with modern ones designed to keep the cold at bay . She saw his truck first , parked close to the front steps of the sturdy house that Robbie had built in the heart of a grove of birches . It was made of natural wood , so that it blended with nature , brown as bark . A huge deck circled it , a perfect place to watch trout jumping in the lake , migrating hawks , setting suns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car and followed the path that led around the house down to the lake . She saw Eliot standing there by the edge edge of the water , looking out across it . " Eliot , " she called . As soon as she spoke his name , she felt released , free to live , free to love , free to settle here by this lovely lake . " Eliot , " she said more loudly . This time , he heard her . He ran toward her , not in the magic of moonlight , when things can appear more wonderful than they are , but with the autumn sun setting his hair afire with amber light , the orbit of his life spinning into hers . And then she was running , too , the white birches blurring , the lake itself rising up to meet her . Author Affiliation K.C. Mc Kinnon is a pseudonym for a respected literary novelist .
