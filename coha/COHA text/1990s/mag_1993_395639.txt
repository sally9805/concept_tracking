We paired two enthusiastic singles  --  writer Pamela Johnson and TV and record executive Benny Medina  --  and set them loose on a blind date in L.A. , pledging them to tell the truth . Here are their tales of what happened that Saturday night . SHE SAID Boo-hoo loud enough and someone will hand you a tissue . That was my thinking when I sent my sob story " Learning From Lost Loves " ( ESSENCE , February 1993 ) to my former coworkers and forever sisters at this magazine . I wrote it to ease my hurting heart . I wrote it so we could all be a little smarter next time out . And I wo n't lie , I wrote it to get paid . But I had not the tiniest inkling that my crisp , analytical writing style , thank you very much , would prompt the editors to land me a date fit for a princess . I call it that because , on paper , Benny Medina sounded bejeweled : Warner Brothers senior vice-president , coproducer of The Fresh Prince of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tevin Campbells of the earth . And so there I stood holding the phone , listening to his A-list Hollywood resume with one ear and to cowboys scuffling up and down the New Mexico State Fairgrounds with the other . I was at the fair , finishing up 17 days of covering this bizarre annual event for my Albuquerque newspaper . I needed a break . I flew into Los Angeles the morning of the date . All week I had been hearing from " Benny 's People " about how excited he was . But when he finally called that Saturday afternoon , he sounded like someone had dialed my number and shoved the phone into his hand . " Now what is it we 're supposed to do ? " he asked me . I took his question to be a sign of nervousness more than anything . I felt anxious , too . To throw off some pressure , I told him I view the assignment simply as two folks hanging out for a few hours , then writing about it . He said he had planned drinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only , I wondered , did he mean dancing or dancing ? My mother fussed at me to hurry when The Car cut its engine in the driveway , and I was still flying around the house swabbing and dabbing . I was 99-percent ready  --  wearing this burgundy Mae West-type dress , hooked up Santa Fe-style with turquoise-and-silver jewelry . I 'd lost a whole half hour to the shoe decision : whether I 'd wear the suede cowboy boots I 'd brought with me or slip on a pair of my mother 's fancy pumps . Unfortunately , as I rummaged through her closet , I was forced to go through shoe box after shoe box . Unlike me , she does n't keep her shoes in a convenient heap on her closet floor . When I stepped out of the house in the pumps , I saw the black stretch limo that took up most of the driveway . The chauffeur held the door while I slid along the cavernous backseat . I felt like Cinderella Brown . But I was a little disappointed that my fresh prince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 45 minutes away , the last five minutes of which went to winding our way up a mazelike hill . Standing in front of his door , I was so jittery that I paced around a bit before I summoned the courage to ring the bell . And then , my date : A handsome teddy bear come to life . Under an electric-blue blazer , he wore black from his shirt to his shoes . I noted a gentle quality about him . Yet he seemed strong , as if he could throw some blows if the need arose . When he excused himself and jetted off in a stream of nervous energy , I surveyed his home . It was serene , spacious and sparkling . Candles flickered . No doubt , this was the home of a romantic man . When we got in the limo , though , Benny still seemed high-strung . The soft , sensual mood of his home disappeared behind us as we cruised down the hill and he made and answered several phone calls . I wanted to check out Benny the Romantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I was beginning to get frustrated , he put the car phone down and talked to me . I found him kind and sensitive , and we warmed up to each other quickly . I told him I 'd heard The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air is based loosely on his life . He responded that it was true and , without a hint of hesitation , told me how he had floated from foster home to foster home as a boy , moving in with an affluent Jewish family at age 8 . At an intimate restaurant where Hollywood types talk business , we talked relationships . He asked me if I was seeing anyone . I told him I was ( at least I thought I was  --  having been psyched out a couple of times in recent months . ) He told me of a broken engagement and of the dancer he had been out with the week before who seemed more interested in his world than in him . Then he said something that surprised me : that he wants to retire at 40  --  he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house husband . Hearing him say " husband " reminded me of my mother and of my friends Cathy and Kate . Call them the " You never know " chorus . From the moment they heard about the date , they began to say , " You never know where this could lead . " Or " You never know , you and Benny Medina could fall in love . " And sitting there , laughing with Benny , I had to amen the chorus . You never know . We moved on , cruising over to another restaurant Benny wanted me to see . If playful and honest conversation was the beginning of intellectual attraction , this stop , where we came for no other reason than to experience its beauty , stirred me . Benny the Romantic was back . But the romantic feelings landed on ice shortly after we arrived at restaurant number three . It was a perfect place to mine for rhinestones . Talking here with Benny , it seemed we were out of sync again . Just as he began to throw out ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my word processor went off-line . Thank God for the dance floor . I ca n't help but admire a man who uses it as it was intended . Some people go out there half-stepping . I loved it that Benny was n't afraid to get wet . We started off simply enough , but then he would bust a move  --  say a wicked spin  --  and I would dig down into my bag of tricks . There was no can-you-top-that involved , just two soulful children adding our corporal commentary to songs we liked . Yet , on another level , there was something sensual in our moving together without even touching . No words spoken , no words necessary . Back at the booth , we munched appetizers , drank wine and downed water from pretty blue bottles . Then a song one of us liked would come on , and we 'd head for the dance floor . Benny and I continued to tango at stop number four . This place was up more winding roads . You buzzed at the gate , and the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a wall lined with gold and platinum records and framed pictures of himself with everybody . A jukebox played song after song , and Benny and I danced for hours . At one point he disappeared and came back in a fresh shirt . The balls of my feet were so tender , I could hardly walk to the car when we left around 5:30 in the morning . I rested in Benny 's arms on the way back to his house . Although we 'd come close a few times , we still had n't kissed once . We agreed that having to write about the date made us feel cautious . " Let 's just turn in blank sheets of paper , " he said at one point . When the limo pulled up in front of Benny 's place for the second time , I was so exhausted that I was willing myself awake . But I sensed that Benny could have gone another ten hours . I felt close to him . Finally we ventured a good-night kiss . Then he slipped away , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Benny and I have talked a few times since our date . I 've called him ; he 's called me . Once I got him on the phone and felt rushed off : He was in his Benny-the-Minute-Chaser mode , working like a fiend . But the other times he was the animated , talkative Benny who surprised me with total recall of our date . Will we go out again ? You never know . I do know that memory fades with time . But even as two beaming faces , a burgundy dress , a blue blazer and four swiveling shoes lose their brilliance to sepia tones , I will long remember Benny and a special Saturday night . HE SAID It had been a very busy week , with seemingly everything that could go wrong going wrong . I was both excited and anxious about my blind date with Pamela on Saturday . I love the nightlife , but usually I choose an evening at the theater or a concert with dinner for a first date . But on this particular Saturday , I could only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richard III on Sunday , and Chaka Khan had already " rocked the house " at the Greek Theater on Friday . I had n't talked to Pamela , and I did n't know what kind of things she liked to do , so I decided that the evening would be spontaneous . Pamela was coming from Albuquerque and would be staying with her mother , who lived just outside Los Angeles . I spoke with her on Saturday afternoon to make sure that we were on for that night , and that it would be okay to send a car for her . I arranged to have her picked up at 7:00 P.M. , which would get her to my house around 7:45 or 8:00 . With Pamela meeting me at my place , I decided to tidy up a bit , picking up the magazines , videos , records , socks , shoes and anything else that had been spread from one end of the house to the other . I had instructed the driver to call me when he was 15 minutes away . When he did , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 minutes later the doorbell rang and the reality of the evening hit me . As I approached the door , my palms began to sweat a bit , as they do when I 'm nervous . I opened the door and there she was  --  the perfect height , a nice smile , tempting eyes , a burgundy dress ( not exposing much ) and lots of turquoise jewelry . Cool  --  or so she seemed , which was good because that instantly calmed me down . I invited her in for a minute , so that I could grab a few things , and then we headed to the car . Eight is a bit early to go out , so I thought we should have a drink before going to dinner . So we went to a popular Sunset Boulevard hangout . She ordered Evian and I had a martini  --  up , with two olives . Pamela said she was n't much for drinking but occasionally would have a glass of wine  --  not now , though , maybe at dinner . She has a very relaxed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her . Since I felt at ease with her , we discussed this arranged evening to see if she had any of the same concerns I 'd been wrestling with : What to say ? What to do ? How far could or should this night go ? As it turned out , she was very cool about things , easygoing and okay with just having a good time in the city . Throughout the evening , it was that same carefree , totally free-flowing , adaptable quality that relaxed me enough not to carry on with any pretenses ( which she would have seen through anyway ! ) . This quality about her , interestingly enough , made the date seem more natural than the other times I had been set up on blind dates by friends . After our initial break-the-ice drinks , I wanted Pamela to see the decor of one of my favorite hangs in L.A. So we shot down Sunset Boulevard to La Cienega and dropped in at Tryst to check it out . She agreed that it was beautiful . But it was too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on our way to the final dinner destination  --  a popular supper club called Ava 's . Like all the other hot spots in Los Angeles , Ava 's had all the major showy automobiles lined up in front and a crowd waiting anxiously to get in . I was a little concerned that there might be some kind of issue at the door or that they would dis ' me . But it never happened , and I was happy since that kind of negative energy can really put a damper on a night on the town . We were shown to our table , right next to the dance floor . Pamela said she liked that since she could feel the music , with the heavy bass , thumping against the wall . That was definitely " music " to my ears since that 's my business ! Finally our conversation moved to a discussion about relationships . I 'm not currently in a relationship and neither is she . Actually , I enjoy my independence right now . Having just come off of a two-and-a-half-year relationship that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems , I 've thrown myself into my work . The waitress asked us if we wanted a drink , and I wondered if Pamela was in the mood to have glass of wine . She was , and she indicated that she preferred chardonnay . Ava 's is really high-energy with lots of activity . However , we managed to focus primarily on each other , toasting , talking , not yet touching , but feeling very cozy . I was never really sure of Pamela 's age , but she had a very innocent , childlike quality  --  curious and probing and extremely ladylike at the same time . Just as the lights in the restaurant dimmed , a song kicked in that Pamela seemed to like a lot , so I asked her to dance . Pamela has really got moves ! I felt like we were doing a show for all of the people whose seats lined the dance floor , and they were getting their money 's worth . I can still see the way Pamela worked her stuff with serious " sister attitude . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be cool because I sweat fast and the night was still young . We went back to our table to eat , and we continued to talk as the crowd continued to grow in size . Pamela was really cool in the midst of all this . As we ate , we started to talk about kids and I told her about my desire to be a house husband  --  how much I 'd love to be able , by the time I have kids , to spend all of my time with them and that if my wife wanted to work  --  fine . I think she liked this idea but did n't quite believe me . But I was serious . A few friends came over to say " hey " and told me about a little party that was happening at a mutual friend 's house after Ava 's closed . Pamela seemed up for it , so we left and got into the car and shot up Doheny past Sunset Boulevard to kick it at my friend Richard 's gated estate . He calls a room in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , with a jukebox full of dance-party hits from all eras . Again , Pamela adjusted quickly to this new group of people and the environment . I was impressed . She never seemed concerned about my being distracted by someone else , and she never seemed intimidated by a new group of people . I really appreciated that because so often in the past it seems to be a problem with dates . Pamela really seemed to enjoy meeting this new group of people , and she fit in very well . I was feeling great , the music sounded terrific and we started dancing again . It seems that when we started to dance , everyone in the room joined in and the party kicked in . Pamela was by far the best dancer there , and the other girls definitely took notice . I loved being with the best dancer in the place . I remember other guys coming up and trying to dance with her  --  she 'd play them for a few beats  --  but always stayed with me . We must have danced nonstop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time it was very , very late and the crowd had definitely thinned out . I thought it was time we head for home . ( Oh , by the way , I was soaked ! ) As we winded down Sunset Boulevard to my house , Pamela talked about when she would come back to town and about getting together again . I hoped we could because I had really enjoyed myself , much more than I expected I would . I think she felt that way , too . Not wanting to be forward , I gave Pamela a gentle kiss on the lips when the car came to a stop in front of my house . She returned the kiss . At that moment , I realized that in a week when everything had gone wrong , I had just made a new friend  --  and suddenly everything was very right !
