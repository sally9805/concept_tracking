With so many of her people gone , Mary had little cleaning work . However , she had places to stay , surreptitiously . She would be owed money from dog walking and pet feeding when her clients returned . She figured that going in and out of the Anzio house much was asking for trouble . She was content to lie low and watch TV . She even made a pot of soup , something she hardly ever got to do . She drank hot tea all day long . She took two long warm baths a day , soaking her weary achy body until it shone . She tried a little of each bubble bath , gel , and oil . Damask rose was her favorite . She washed her hair , laundered her clothes , polished her shoes , and cleaned her galoshes . In damp cold weather , everything got wet and never dried out , till she smelled like a garage floor . <p> By Friday morning , she was fit again . It was those church basements that got her , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Summers had their own problems  --  she could n't close up the houses as tight so that the light would n't show  --  although in her observation , most people left lights on nowadays , and the sun set so late that she had to wait till eight thirty to slip into her chosen shelter . But if she got caught short , she could sleep in a garage for a night . It was dirty and it did n't feel safe , but it was better than the streets . Twice she spent the night in a gazebo of a fancy house on Brattle Street . <p> Winter was a different story . Night came down early , but sleeping outside could kill her . Had n't she almost died , back when she was new to life on the streets ? It was always dangerous from the weather and from the men who would hurt any woman they could . <p> After every meal , she put her garbage neatly into a plastic bag in her shopping bag . She was always prepared . She carried her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything of theirs she used , she washed at once : compulsive , but part of her daily discipline . She had always been a mad housekeeper who never left dishes in the sink or beds unmade or dust under the couch . Besides , she owed it to the people whose houses she borrowed to return them at least as clean as she found them . Third , she had a policy , leave no traces . <p> The Anzios were in Florida over Christmas , to visit his parents who 'd retired to Sanibel Island . About thirty years ago , her husband , her children , and she spent ten days there . She remembered her two-piece turquoise bathing suit Jim was crazy about . It was a color they used a lot then , in architecture , in furnishings , in clothing . He could n't keep his hands off her when she wore that suit . She was fair and she had to be careful in the sun . Nobody had heard of sunscreen in those days so she just burned . Sea shells . Conch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a screen . Once , feeling daring , they had made love in it while the children were at the beach . When a man was so crazy about you , it was hard to imagine that a time would come when he just wanted you out of his way , when he treated you like a piece of cheese that had turned bad . Her sin was to get middle-aged . Time nibbled away at her looks . <p> It happened so gradually that she simply did n't realize she was n't a pretty girl any longer . Mary never got fat . Oh , she put on some weight  --  not as much as he did , but some . She thickened around the middle , in the ankles and upper arms . Since she was a baby she had always been pretty , so she took it for granted . Maybe she should have dyed her hair , but when she asked Jim , he pooh-poohed it , saying he liked her the way she was , he liked her natural . All her ladies dyed their hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and keep her mouth shut . <p> Mary had thought she was exempt from the adultery she knew had rotted many suburban marriages around them . Those scandals were the problems of other women , who had failed in their marriages . She thought because she knew how to shop and how to run a house and how to make conversation with a judge or an undersecretary 's wife or a urologist , that she knew all about life . She imagined because her husband wanted her passionately into her thirties , that he would always want her . <p> A housewife did n't give much weight to boredom , because whether she was waiting for a husband to come home or a baby to be born or a load of clothes to dry or a roast to cook , she spent a lot of time exercising her patience . From one little crisis to the next pressing job , the days unwound . She was worrying about Jaime 's grades in algebra or whether Cindy was going to fit into her prom dress , and she was thinking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or help the heart , and whether she could get her family to eat that way . She was thinking that Jaime did n't want to go to the Maryland shore this year and where should they take a vacation that would satisfy everybody  --  not including herself , because she took for granted that if they were satisfied , so was she . She was thinking about , the driveway cement is cracking and the dog has to go to the vet for his shots and is it Ed Vickers or Ed Simmons that Dr. Caldwell ca n't stand at the dinner table with him ? Yes , she had been swimming in a big pink aquarium , and she never thought that somebody would come along with a hammer and break it until she was gasping for her life and everything she had taken for granted , for permanent , was gone . <p> At times she let herself pretend she lived in the Anzio house . She was always amazed how much changed in this home , how often Mrs. Anzio got rid of a couch or ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furniture was moved around . Vases , bric-a-brac came and went . Nobody understood how precious were the things they were used to , until they lost them . If she had a little cot of her own , she would love it like a pet . The day after Christmas , the Anzios were due back , but the Baers were leaving . She would clean up carefully early tomorrow morning and decamp . The malls would be mobbed , and she could hang out . <p> Today , Christmas , she must see Beverly . Beverly had been a bag lady operating nearby , whom Mary had greeted when she went to clean in that neighborhood every Wednesday and Friday . After Beverly had been attacked and left for dead in a Dumpster , Mary had begun visiting her in the hospital . Beverly was the only person in the world Mary could talk to honestly , the only person who knew she was homeless too . <p> She had bought Beverly wool pants at Goodwill . The lining was torn , but Mary had spent the evening mending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would hold a lot . The pants were dark red and really warm . She would also bring Beverly a couple of chocolates from a party at the Millers ' . She had discreetly hidden treats as she was cleaning up , including most of a plate of only slightly stale tiny sandwiches  --  canapes such as she had put out in her days as a Bethesda hostess . That had been her supper , although the pate had given her indigestion . Her stomach must be more delicate these days , from not eating much . When she was younger , she could eat anything , no matter how fiery or spicy , and not even belch . Her ex-husband Jim used to say , Mary has an asbestos tummy . <p> Catering must be a nice business . All that food to snack on . Marry a professional man , they told her when she was growing up ; they should have said , be a caterer , buy a property and pay it off fast . Never mind the rest . Get a job around food and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you alone . Now that was advice no romantic young girl would ever heed . <p> The nurse 's station had been perfunctorily decorated , a plate of Christmas cookies set out on the counter . Beverly sat up in the half empty room . Two of the patients had been released in time for the holiday . None of the original women with whom Beverly had shared the ward were still there . The others had been discharged ; different women had come in their place and left again . Beverly 's injuries had been serious , her condition bad , but they were also keeping her rather than discharge her to the street . Someone had taken an interest . A program had been found to cover her , but she was going to have to leave soon . <p> Beverly was fiddling with her ragged gray hair , growing back where they had shaved her head . " They 're going to discharge her to Rosie 's Place . " <p> Mary nodded . She was used to the way Beverly spoke of herself in the third person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weird . " You ca n't go on the streets the way you are . Better to stay in a shelter till the weather warms up . As long as they let you stay . " <p> " She always managed . She 's tough . But she hates the noise and the prying . She remembers the Pine Street shelter in the old days . They took your stuff away at night . It was all the time waiting in line . They took your soul away . " <p> " I did n't like shelters either , " Mary said . " But if I was injured , I 'd do it till I was strong again . The winter 's so hard . " <p> Beverly loved the pants . Why could she do the right thing for her friend , but never for her daughter or her grandchildren ? That night , lying on the Anzios ' couch , she kept thinking about Beverly leaving the hospital . It was one of the worst days of her life when she had to leave her little apartment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ashamed of it , not understanding how lucky she was to have a so-called studio apartment , no matter how noisy and dilapidated and scurrying with mice that fouled her food . B.U. had I bought the building to turn into student housing . <p> Her apartment and her job vanished together . She worked in a stationer 's shop in the same block , and the renovation threw the store out a couple of months before she was evicted . Teodoro 's Stationers could not find rent low enough so the marginal business could thrive . Mr. Teodoro was soon working at Stop &; Shop , and she was running through her money in bottom-drawer motels . <p> Before she had been evicted , it had become evident she could afford nothing that existed , and the wait for public housing was forever and a day . Finally they had thrown her few things on the sidewalk in a pitiful pile she had to walk away from , carrying her two suitcases and her raincoat and winter coat , her quilt . She was too stunned , too numb to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her chair , her bed , her pots and dishes . What would become of her ? <p> There had always been neighborhoods of cheap rooming houses when she was growing up . When had they disappeared ? Where did poor people live now ? Everything she could find was beyond her income . She wrote to Cindy and she wrote to Jaime . Cindy sent her a letter full of advice on budgeting her income , a check for two hundred dollars , and a long complaint about the cost of raising children in the Washington area . Two of her kids were in private schools . She simply did not have any discretionary income . What had happened to the settlement Daddy had given her ? <p> Given me , Mary thought . I earned every penny , and he never gave me a cent more than the nasty judge made him part with . Where did it go ? To relocate here . To pay bills . To buy medical insurance , now lapsed because she could not make the payments . To buy a winter coat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rent . To fix her car , while she had been able to keep it running . <p> Jaime put a twenty in an envelope and said he would send money whenever he could . The next month he sent another twenty . Nothing the next month . Then again . Once in a while he sent a twenty , always folded up neatly in a card with a joke on it . She forgave his failure to help her . Over the years he had probably given her more in his impulsive and disjointed way than Cindy with her lists and her excuses . And he had far less money to start with . Cindy made some money from her silly boutique , and her husband minted it . <p> Every day for the next two months , Mary looked for a job , but jobs were like ex-husbands : they wanted someone young and slender . She had had friends in the building , but they were scattered . Several had gone back where they came from , moving in with relatives in Tennessee or Kansas . Three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beach , where they let her use their phone . She got into the Y for three weeks , then her money ran out . She could not find a job , and soon she was down to her last ten dollars . She was frankly terrified . <p> She had sold off her microwave , her jewelry , her good watch , her clock radio , and most of her wardrobe . She had to winnow the artifacts of her life , the photos , the letters , the mementos . She threw away her old report cards and honors and diplomas . She tossed her wedding and divorce papers . Most of the mementos of her children she sent to Cindy and Jaime , keeping only a couple of photos . To Jaime she sent most of the photos of her parents , her grand-parents , baby pictures , the record of her life . The letters she simply tore up . <p> She ended up with what would fit on her back , into a small suitcase , and into a large fabric carryall she had used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On April 7 she walked out of the Y she had been calling home and into the city , with no idea what was going to become of her . <p> She was on the streets and terrified . She had no idea what to do with herself , where to go , how to manage . In six months she had gone from being a woman with a job and a little apartment and all the normal wardrobe and items  --  clock radio , electric toothbrush , microwave  --  that she had taken for granted as props of any normal life , to being a woman with a small suitcase she lugged about with her and a large fabric carryall . She did not know where to go to the bathroom . During the daytime hours , she used the public library bathroom or the bathrooms in the department stores . <p> The first night she tried to sleep in a doorway , the suitcase was stolen . That simplified everything . It was the other street people who told her what to do . They thought she was funny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satin down quilt she still had from her old life , carrying around a little pillow for her head . <p> The first days on the street , she kept bursting into tears . She could not believe this was happening . She was becoming dirty . She smelled bad . Her clothes were beginning to fray , stiff with dirt and wrinkled from being slept in . She was Mary Ferguson Burke . She had gone to college . She bad raised two children . She had entertained the assistant undersecretary of commerce . She had belonged to a country club . She had had an all-electric kitchen . She had been photographed with Cindy both astride bays for an article in a local paper on summer activities . She had owned forty pairs of shoes and eight coats and a dozen cocktail dresses . Now she was sleeping in a cardboard box in an alley , wearing filthy rags and smelling like garbage . <p> People would look at her and look away , they would stare through her . They would give her glances of disgust . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She should be scraped off and put in a Dumpster . A younger black woman named Samantha took her in tow . She had been hit by a car in an alley and walked stiff-legged , favoring her right side . She had lost half her teeth , but she still had a smile that made Mary feel warmed . Mary learned to stay away from her when she had not had a drink yet and again when she had too much , but in between , Samantha was kind and wanted to help . She decided Mary should try shelters . Samantha preferred life on the streets because she was crazy in love with an alkie they called Sly . She took Mary to Morgan Memorial , showed her the shelters , soup kitchens , and where to get off the streets to keep warm , where to get water , how to pee in alleys without being seen . " Remember , honey , everything you got to do is wrong . It 's against the law to sleep , to wash yourself , to pee , to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't do it if the law see you . Now , I ca n't pass no more . They know me . But you , you can still walk through a crowd , but you ca n't go along shuffling . You got to pick up your head and look like one them tight white women . Then you can pass and hang out without them hassling you all the time . They like to beat on us . I ca n't get by no more , but you can . You just got to try . " <p> Samantha , dead of hypothermia three Januaries before . She had seen it on the evening news while camping in one of her clients ' houses . Samantha was the first black friend she had ever had . Without her , she would not have made it . <p> Even now the smells overwhelmed her : sweat , vomit , urine , dust , disinfectant , the smells from the big kitchen . Always twenty people were coughing every moment . Stand in line to get in the door . Stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in line for your foam cup , your paper plate , your utensils , your starchy supper . Get in line for your towel . Line up for a shower . Line up to get your bed for the night . Line up if you want a locker , but there 's a four-month waiting list . Get in line for your meds if they gave you tranks . Lots of the women were on Thorazine or something equally numbing or destructive . Stand in line to get clothes from the room , get a clean nightie . <p> The beds were a foot apart and she slept on her purse and wallet . She could hear this one muttering , that one in some kind of withdrawal , the other just crying . She could hear and smell them all and she could guess what she must seem like to others . <p> She could not let herself be pushed down into the faceless mass of " guests . " She was not an alcoholic , she did not use drugs , she had not been abused beyond the ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to distinguish herself in the eyes of the staff from the helpless hopeless women around her . But it was hard . It was hard to remember that she had ever had a real life . At five A.M. they had to be up and by eight , they were out on the street again to pass the day until late afternoon . <p> She had felt like a baggy body for which there was no room but this large storage bin . Many women were sick . Some were severely malnourished . Many had ulcerating soles on their legs or feet , sores that stank . It was not avoidable when a woman walked all day long on pavement in ill-fitting shoes and worse-fitting socks with holes in them . <p> There was no privacy , no silence , no place she could call her own . Every night that she managed to get into the shelter , never certain because beds for women were limited , she never knew where she would sleep . Nothing belonged to her . No space was her own . She was called a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and you were excluded . The staff had changing blacklists of women who were no longer allowed inside . Life and death in the winter and sometimes in warmer weather . Life on the streets killed you slow , but sometimes people or the weather saw that it happened a lot faster . <p> She volunteered , she made herself useful , and the staff liked that . Soon she no longer smelled . She showered , she washed her hair . She began trying to get work again , but putting down the address of the shelter was iffy . Still , it was better than no address . She had been a secretary , she had sold in stores , she had been a cashier . She could find nothing . She looked far older than she had six months before . Her hair was scraggly and iron gray with an odd stain that had got into it one night when she slept on a grate . <p> She took pains with her appearance , but it was difficult . There were only three little mirrors over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dim . Still she put on makeup Saturday and went to see her old friends in Revere Beach . They were scared too . They had to be out of their rental by the end of May , and they had no idea where they were going . They asked her where she was living , and she said , with a friend . I just sleep on her couch  --  it 's temporary . They apologized and said they could n't offer her their couch as Gigi was sleeping on it . But Gigi cut her hair and gave her a home perm . It felt wonderful to be with people who remembered her , who did not know she was no longer a person but a statistic , one of the despised who were thrust from the table and the room . <p> The shelter was a holding area to keep the women alive one more night . When she finally got a job with a cleaning service , she decided that she was rejoining the ranks of the living , however much stealth and subterfuge that took . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle class .
