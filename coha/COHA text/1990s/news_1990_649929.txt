<p> The agreement by the U.N . Security Council 's five permanent members on a framework for a settlement of the Cambodian conflict , and the plan 's adoption by the four Cambodian factions , does not mean the millenium has arrived in that benighted country . It does mean that , at long last , there are grounds for genuine hope that the Khmer Rouge can be prevented from returning to power and that the Cambodian people will be able peacefully to determine their own destiny . <p> The Security Council proposal calls for a cease-fire , a substantial U.N . peace-keeping force , the termination of all external military support , the disarmament of the four Cambodian factions and U.N . control over the existing administration to create conditions for an internationally supervised , free and fair election . <p> Driving this approach has been the belief that the battle-hardened and well supplied Khmer Rouge are likely to come to power if the current civil war continues . Conversely , if the U.N . framework results in an agreement among the Cambodians themselves , and China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will be much easier to contain Pol Pot and his murderous minions . <p> Despite the extraordinary progress of the last month , critics of the framework can not resist the urge to carp and cavil . They say it will cost more than the international community is willing to pay . They warn that the Khmer Rouge will use a U.N . settlement to take power again in Phnom Penh . They object that the Khmer Rouge are included in the settlement at all . They would even have the Bush Administration abandon the framework accepted by the Security Council and the Cambodian factions . <p> Instead , the nay-sayers want the Administration to embrace the Phnom Penh regime led by Hun Sen , to urge the non-Communist factions to participate in internationally observed elections under the Hun Sen Government 's aegis and to pressure China and Thailand to end their assistance to the Khmer Rouge . <p> The critics ' objections to the U.N . approach are readily answered . Underwriting a peace-keeping force , an internationally supervised election and the overseeing of several strategic ministries will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the negotiating effort - the five permanent members themselves , Japan , Australia and others - understand that they have to support diplomacy with money . And after all the hand-wringing and teeth-gnashing in the U.S. about the Khmer Rouge , it begs credulity that we would not contribute our fair share . <p> To be sure , the Khmer Rouge have not given up their objective of regaining power . Pol Pot will first try to win the elections . But there is every reason to believe he will fail . Opponents of Pol Pot , a man with more than a million deaths on his record , wo n't need the services of Roger Ailes to prepare negative campaign ads . <p> After they lose the elections , the Khmer Rouge may indeed decide to resume an armed struggle . Yet their chances of success will be severely diminished if , as the result of an international agreement , their forces have been demobilized and disarmed , and Thailand and China are no longer providing them sanctuary and support . Surely , the government that emerges from a U.N.-supervised election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to contain the Khmer Rouge than is the current Phnom Penh regime . <p> Objecting to the inclusion of the Khmer Rouge in a settlement made sense so long as the Bush Administration was supporting the resistance coalition 's demand for a four-party interim government in which the Khmer Rouge would have been given an important role . <p> But the U.N . approach is designed to deprive the Khmer Rouge of any operational responsibility in the transitional authority . It does provide for Khmer Rouge participation in the election . Yet if they are not even given an opportunity to contest the election , however dismal their chances , there will be no agreement . Under these circumstances , Pol Pot will fight on with Chinese support and probably win a military victory . The perfect would have defeated the good . <p> Now that the quest for a U.N.-based diplomatic solution is bearing fruit , it is inconceivable that the U.S. would walk out on an agreement it had worked so hard to forge . <p> Nor should we risk undermining the whole negotiating process at this delicate juncture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That would greatly diminish the pressure on Vietnam and the Hun Sen Government to make the concessions needed to achieve a settlement . Moreover , if elections are held , it would deprive the Cambodian people of a democratic alternative to Khmer Rouge Maoists and Phnom Penh Leninists . <p> Of course , the whole effort could still fall apart because of disagreements among the Cambodians . Yet the Security Council formula has already exceeded the expectations of its proponents . It is , in truth , the last best hope for peace in Cambodia . We can not now change course or abandon those who depend on us . Repudiating the U.N . framework and embracing the Hun Sen regime would be tantamount to snatching defeat from the jaws of victory .
