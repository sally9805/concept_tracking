<p> THE OLD JOKE IN photography is about the woman who looks into a baby carriage and exclaims , " Oh , what a beautiful baby ! " " That 's nothing , " says the mother . " You should see his picture . " <p> Photographers are practiced flatterers  --  and with children it takes a lot of practice . Already in 1855 , a photographer wrote that a baby " is a very nice thing to have around the house " but somewhat less nice to have around the studio . Among other things , he said , the parents want their children to look beautiful , but the children do not always comply . <p> Portraiture can run into that problem whatever the subject 's age , of course ; children are just harder to stage-manage . Robert Mapplethorpe , according to his biographer Patricia Morrisroe , thought them the most difficult subjects of all . " You ca n't control them , " he said . " They never do what you want them to do . " ( Unlike his leather-clad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of children 's portraits , often just for friends . The Robert Miller Gallery on 57th Street in Manhattan has 23 of them , many never exhibited or published before , on view through Saturday , and they bring up the question of how we choose to see our children . <p> Although the famous flap over Mapplethorpe was principally about his sadomasochistic pictures of homosexuals , two of the portraits of children also drew critical fire . ( In Mapplethorpe 's work , the only category that escaped censorship was the flower pictures . Some of these outdo Georgia O'Keeffe in comparing flowers to human sexual organs , but even Senator Jesse Helms was reluctant to preach in public against oversexed lilies . ) The pictures " Jesse McBride , " of a young boy posing frontally nude atop a chair , and " Rosie , " of a seated 4-year-old in a dress but no underpants , her legs bent and revealing her genitals , were among the pictures that set off the obscenity trial in Cincinnati in 1990 . <p> By that time , McBride was 18 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he assumed the same pose for a photograph that was published in the Village Voice . Neither his parents nor Rosie 's ever objected to the images ; in fact , in depositions at the trial , both mothers reiterated their approval of the photographs and said that they were present when the pictures were made . But particularly for those who do n't know the details , Rosie 's picture has more complicated overtones . The fact that , though clothed , she unwittingly displays her genitals puts the spectator in a slightly uneasy position ; besides , her expression could be read as wariness . <p> Mapplethorpe had an agenda : " Children are sexual beings , " he said , " but it 's an area that makes most people feel uncomfortable . " So he toned the sex way down : In " Honey and Rosie , " the two girls are naked but proper enough for our taste , and the charming nude picture of Melia Marden shows her from the back . Generally he hedged his bets by portraying children as little adults . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Women by Mapplethorpe , " the book that he was working on before he died in 1989 . Most of the children at Robert Miller are solemn , cool , self-possessed and confident , in training to be entrepreneurs or femmes fatales or , most likely of all , the subjects of Mapplethorpe portraits . <p> He was good at producing glamour and elegance of various sorts , less so at capturing individuality , except in his best portrait work , which was of himself . The gallery has cleverly paired this show with Alice Neel 's paintings of pregnant nudes , but Neel 's pictures are so expressive that they point up Mapplethorpe 's relative emotional flatness . <p> Some of the children are posed with an artifice beyond their years  --  careful poses , hands up in ritual gestures . One sits on the floor next to a slanting shaft of light with her knees raised and her arms hugging them , an approximate combination of two of Mapplethorpe 's well-known images of the singer Patti Smith . One 3- or 4-year-old girl in three-quarter view , a lovely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing and wary she must have seen much and manipulated more . Only a couple of the children are spontaneously , charmingly childlike . <p> THE PERCEPTION OF children as little adults dates to the early years of photography but fell away in this century ; Mapplethorpe is part of a recent return to it from a different set of prejudices . Merry Foresta , a senior curator at the National Museum of American Art in Washington , who has studied children in daguerreotypes , says that children were important subjects in the 1840 's and 50 's . Their chances of survival were just beginning to improve , and parents could invest themselves more heavily in shaping their offspring . <p> She points out that roles for the future were clearly spelled out : boys were shown with books , toy guns or bows and arrows ; girls with bunches of flowers or small pets and some in off-the-shoulder dresses , one hand reaching up to pull a sleeve farther down . Children were not yet considered sexual beings , which is why Lewis Carroll could get away with taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while , and why Freud would later encounter such resistance to his theories of infantile sexuality . But training for sex roles obviously started early . <p> It was so hard to make children sit still for a long time that many of the early subjects came out looking like generic little people , not much more individuated than the toys and studio props that accompanied them . They were treated a bit like props themselves , but sometimes adults were , too . In one 19th-century picture , a child sits on the lap of his mother , whose head and body are completely covered with fabric in a vain attempt to make her look like an armchair . <p> Late in the century , social-reform movements rallied society to protect children . Photography took up the cause of the oppressed or exploited young , first in photographs taken in the slums by the crusading reporter Jacob Riis , then most notably in the pictures of child labor made with such effort and tenacity by Lewis Hine . <p> In Hine 's pictures there is a relatively new sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , overwhelmed , they are no longer just diminutive adults ; now they are young people with characters and the potential to be molded , or damaged , by experience . <p> A new symbolic figure can be found in a few of Riis 's pictures : the child victim who sums up the plight of a whole populace , in this case the largely immigrant populace of slum dwellers . The figure of the innocent and helpless child as sufferer , sometimes standing for suffering in general or even for inhumanity , seems to have entered the visual vocabulary through photography about 100 years ago . Since then it has become one of the primary and recurrent motifs of the century . <p> There is the photograph of a baby alone and screaming on the Shanghai railroad platform in 1937 just after a Japanese bombing , the Jewish boy wearing a yellow star and raising his hands as Nazis lead him away , the March of Dimes poster child , the hungry child in the advertisement for charitable aid , the naked girl running from napalm in Vietnam , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> After World War II , though the suffering child recurred periodically , photographers announced their faith in the future by glorifying the image of childhood . From W. Eugene Smith 's " Walk to Paradise Garden , " a photograph from the back of two small children trudging into the sunlight in a forest , to the happy children in photographs taken by diaper services and Irving Penn 's picture of a blond , big-eyed , angelic little girl in a shapeless white gown , children were seen as innocent creatures worthy of sentimentalization . <p> But innocence does not last , and the very young began to lose their aura . The demon child gained popularity in books , films and plays like " The Bad Seed , " " The Exorcist " and " Carrie . " A few photographers also tried out a vision of childhood that undermined the case for the helpless child in need of our protection . <p> Through Diane Arbus 's lens , little-girl twins became objects of morbid psychological fascination , a crying baby an unmanageable bundle of needs , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were seen as downright dangerous , if only to middle-class mores , by photographers like Bruce Davidson , Danny Lyon and Larry Clark . More recently , Sally Mann photographed her children in a kind of naked family utopia laced with hints of sexuality and violation . <p> The photographers seldom pictured the less-than-innocent child before society began to worry about juvenile delinquency and young people 's experimenting with drugs and sex . Now that we know about preteen-agers with guns , now that the media have made more proper children sophisticated before their time , hip and possibly cynical about matters not yet within their experience , the young can once again be depicted as little grown-ups . <p> Mapplethorpe does so not because childhood has not been fully differentiated from adulthood , as used to be the case , but because children have arrogated adult roles to themselves . In his case , their chief adult role right now seems to be that of portrait-sitter , as if our society had at last learned to educate its children , at least in the high refinements of presenting themselves to @ @ @
