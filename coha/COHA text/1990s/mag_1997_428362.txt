Section : ROCK &; ROLL New Orleans ' Master P builds a hip-hop empire from the underground up <p> In a dust-blown downtown los Angeles alley , Master P , the CEO of No Limit Records , is shadowboxing with his vice president , Anthony Boswell . They skip and shuffle and throw dangerous-looking hooks that just miss . " I put my money on P , " says one of their colleagues , almost by reflex ; recent times have shown that P , who came out of a New Orleans ghetto to be worth - conservatively - a good $10 million , is a man to bet on . But Boz , giving up a lot of reach , ducks nimbly under a long right and bear-hugs his boss . At risk as they stagger across the cracked asphalt are their costumes , their carefully applied makeup , their very limbs . If one goes down , so could Master P 's first theatrical feature , a caper picture called I Got the Hook Up , which has three weeks left to shoot . Director Michael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $5,000 in 1993 , grins uneasily as the hammerlocked combatants ' Nikes rasp across the alley . Asked if they 're doing this to get psyched for the next scene , one of their posse squints amusedly : " They do this every day . " <p> If " keeping it real " has become the central cliche of hardcore rap , Master P - born Percy Miller 27 years ago - looks to be the realest man left standing . He survived an upbringing in a scary Big Easy project , and to hear the records tell it - P is a bit coy about affirming his supposed criminal history in print - he did so even in the bullet-ripped thin air of " slinging rocks " : dealing crack cocaine . P lost his younger brother Kevin in a drug-related murder . Now he feels the jeopardy that , as demonstrated by the recent deaths of Tupac Shakur and the Notorious B.I.G. , can come with success . " If you want me , come get me , " he raps on a cut from his current album , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? /I got my true niggers with me/And we riders . . . . " Indeed , a stranger with the idea of approaching P in an airport or on a film set runs a gantlet of stares and , drawing closer , interposed ( generally large ) bodies . Like any targeted figure , he could be gotten to - but the instant payback would be a harvest of hollow-point rounds . " We think safety , " Master P says of his tight posse of " No Limit soldiers . " " And we watch everybody . We all together . I think that 's what a family is all about . " <p> Such scenarios sound like melodrama until . . . shit happens . But what rappers call " player haters " - jealous or angry types bent on bringing an icon down - go for the big game , and , along with Puff Daddy , P right now is as big as it gets . The numbers bear witness : Ghetto D has sold more than 2 million units since its Sept. 2 release @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No. 1 ( by dislodging Puffy 's No Way Out ) . P 's recent direct-to-video film , the semiautobiographical I 'm Bout It , has sold more than 250,000 copies this year . In addition , its soundtrack lingers in the Top 200 , and holding spots in the charts are three other discs from P 's No Limit label - Mr. Serv-On 's Life Insurance , female rapper Mia X 's Unlady Like and TRU 's TRU 2 Da Game , a two-disc set boasting cuts from all of the above plus TRU 's central trio : Master P , P 's younger brother Corey ( C-Murder ) and his youngest brother , Zyshonne ( Silkk ) . Finally , Master P 's last solo album , Ice Cream Man , released in April 1996 , is still hanging in the Top 200 as it approaches platinum-sales status . <p> As remarkable as Master P 's track record itself is how he did it - conceiving , producing and performing his own musical and filmed output , art-directing the packaging , marketing it through his own grass-roots schemes and using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market . In ghettos nationwide , P is a folk hero not just for his gangsta roots but for beating the music industry at its own game . <p> Curiously , Master P 's avalanche of musical success has virtually killed his appetite for the game . In one of his typical cross-promotions ( what Master P has mastered , above all , is marketing ) , he used the artwork of Ghetto D to plug his next record , The Last Don , which is due in 1998 and is billed as Master P 's Last Solo Rap Album . What aficionados realize is that P 's solo efforts have been increasingly collaborative anyway . P is not known for his lyrical or musical brilliance but rather for crafting hooks or - as blithely and quickly as any musical magpie now at work - borrowing them . In any event , with I Got the Hook Up in production , another film ( a hard-core action flick called 911 ) in the works and an offer to play legendary pimp Iceberg Slim in an Island Pictures film , P is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the rare hours when he 's not spawning movies , P handles subsidiary projects ( including operating a Foot Locker in New Orleans ) and runs recording sessions in his New Orleans and L.A. studios . " My life 's gotten so hectic now , " P says . " I ca n't go to places I normally would go and do the things I normally do . So work is entertainment for me . " He rubs his brow , then leans forward . " I have fun making movies - giving my community back the reality that they could n't get if I was n't in this position . " <p> P is as quietly serious in a conference room as he is frolicsome and kidlike amid his homeboys . He still looks like the point guard of his school days - a bit bandy-legged , with long arms and a slightly myopic stare through his spectacles . ( Switch him out of his warm-up togs and into a gray suit , and he could pass for an assistant high school principal who likes to carry around a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never could get enough of movies , " says P , who included an hommage to Scarface 's chain-saw scene in I 'm Bout It . " There 's a form of entertainment there people got to have . I mean , rap can come and go overnight , but films , that 's something everybody can watch . Your grandmother could watch a movie . " <p> It must be said that master P 's paternal grandmother , Big Mama , is made of sterner stuff than most - even compared with others dwelling in the hardscrabble 57 acres of New Orleans ' C . To the shorties handling the paint can , C translates to Calliope Projects - 3rd Ward . The city renamed the collection of 1941-vintage , faded-brick dwellings the B.W. Cooper Apartments a few years back , but locals still call it by the name it took from a bordering street ( Calliope being , aptly enough , the Greek muse of heroic poetry ) . " My grandmother , " says P of Maxine Miller , a nursing aide by trade , " never let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Maxine and her husband , Claude Miller , took over the family 's raising when P 's father , Big Percy , and his mother , Josie ( who never recovered from her best friend 's suicide in the family 's back yard ) , split up . " I was about 5 years old , " recalls P , " and I was going to either go to an orphanage or go live with Big Mama - so she took me and my brother Kevin in . She had 12 kids , so we made it 14 , and we all stayed in her house . " This meant that young P often slept in the hallway of the three-bedroom home . Poverty was no excuse for malingering : " I was probably one of the baddest guys in the project , but when school time came around , Big Mama and Big Daddy did n't play . You had to have your books , see that your homework was done , or you was punished - whipped by an extension cord , or had to set on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get out of the project . They wanted somebody to make it . I mean , it was serious . " <p> P was up to the challenge , says LaTanya Rattler-Rankin , a pretty neighbor who , at 16 , was amused by the 13-year-old P 's amorous invitations . Sitting on the same Erato Street stoop where they used to talk , she gives a wry smile when she remembers telling P that if he became a multimillionaire , " ' I 'll see what I can do for you ' . . . not thinking he was really going to be a multimillionaire . <p> " Percy - I ca n't really get with this ' Master P ' thing - always stuck to what he wanted to do , you know , " she continues . " He 's a person that had his mind made up about things . He is going to stick to that , and he 's going to make it happen . Now that he 's known , he 's going to take that and go straight to the top . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P was the next Michael Jordan - in fact , he 'd eventually join a University of Houston basketball team that included pros-to-be Hakeem Olajuwon and Clyde Drexler - and P spent every spare hour chucking balls at the project 's battered hoops . " Three in the morning , no lights on , shooting baskets , " recalls P. " That might be a reason why I survived . All the real killers and drug dealers noticed me as a basketball player . They wanted to see me make it . " <p> Ken " Moon " Jones , P 's coach at Booker T. Washington High School and the man who plays the sinister Officer Friendly in I 'm Bout It , recalls that his " super , super competitive " point guard averaged 22 points a game - until the scruffily outfitted squad went to a regional tournament in Memphis , Tenn. , to play a sneering team with spotless uniforms and a 7-foot center . " P scored 38 that night , " Jones says . <p> One summer day on a 3rd Ward court , P blew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ride to college . He stayed at home in the ghetto , taking on the family 's increasing financial burden as the Miller children grew up . He and Kevin were a team on the street . As his current hit , " I Miss My Homies , " has it : " I used to hang with my boy/Even sling with my boy/I used to bang with my boy/Damn , I miss my boy . . . . " In the nasty cauldron of slinging dope in the C , P 's business principles , as partly outlined in " Ghetto D , " were solidified : " Look for the nigga with the whitest snow . . . . If ya movin ' weight , treat yourself to an Uzi . " <p> Those days of street-corner slinging and watching each other 's backs formed the essence of the No Limit philosophy , typified in the tightness of P and Anthony Boswell . " In the ghetto , " says Boz , " if you do n't be a hustler , you are not going to have anything - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We put ourselves in harm 's way , in jeopardy , in order to take care of our little sisters and our little brothers and our families . We never went out to harm anyone ; we just went out there to have our business - we did n't bother yours . But if you do bother my business , I will interrupt , cease and desist your business . That 's just the law of survival . <p> " Yeah , " he adds , " there 's a lot of guns , and there 's a lot of gunners , but you just got to understand the geometrics of your neighborhood . If you 're watching and paying attention , you can survive . One thing I can say about P : He always pays close attention . " <p> An assistant director summons Boswell to rehearse a stunt . As Boswell walks off , he calls for No Limit 's newest rapper , Mystikal , who 's standing nearby . Boswell pulls a clunky gray .40-caliber pistol out of his waistband ; Mystikal casually tucks it under his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it seems , the ghetto pressures are not far off . " I 'm this thug that grew up to be a man , " says P. " I thought , ' You ca n't live like that no more . You 've got to do something else for yourself if you want to survive . ' And that 's what I 've been doing . I 've been finding other avenues that make money , other avenues to make a change for my family life and for my life . <p> " If I had to do it all over again , " he continues , " I 'd probably do it the same way , because that 's all I know . " One thing he would erase - the central , transforming event in his life - is the murder of his brother Kevin , in 1988 . It came after P had uprooted himself and moved to the Bay Area to escape New Orleans ' mean streets : " I left because I knew that eventually , if I did n't get my life or my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get killed . " He headed for the San Francisco suburb of Richmond , where his mother lived . " I had to decide to go on and chill by my mom 's house and try to do something positive , because it was too hot at home , " he explains . " Everybody was dying there . I wanted to try to start me a record company . " With the fortuitous arrival of a $10,000 check following a relative 's death , P opened a record store . " I asked Kevin to come with me . He got out there for one week , and he said it was too slow for him , " P says . " And when he went back home , he got killed the next day . <p> " We think about Kevin all the time , but we was all put here for a reason . The Lord is tugging on people . We got to use our energy as best as we can use it , and we use ours with this rap music . Everybody trying to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slinging or shooting at people . But we 're letting our frustrations out through this music . When people hear it , they feel it , because they going through the same frustration . " <p> The gang would like to change , " elucidates P on Ghetto D. " The old dope gang is now called a rap gang . In other words - ca n't trust nobody . Money is the root of all evil - I can either be your best friend or your worst nightmare . . . . " <p> What he 's laying out is quite consciously a manifesto - a crude but real primer on how to enter the record business on your own terms . If P got his principles on the street ( " P 's never read Sun-tzu 's The Art of War , " says Boswell , " but he exemplifies it so well " ) , he learned the business from the bottom up . P 's first rule was almost instinctual - cut out the middleman to boost the profit margin , then churn all the money back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had to start small , running his fledgling store , No Limit Records . " The name just came out of me thinking , ' What could I call my business ? How do I see myself ? ' You know what ? I had no limit - so when I came up there , I was like , ' Shit , everything 's going to be no limit . ' " <p> In fact , P 's " hustle " ( the word has entirely positive connotations for him ) has changed only in scope from the days when he sold records out of his trunk to his present status as chairman and sole owner of the hottest indie label in the country . " Any good businessperson would learn their business from the ground up , " says P , who casts himself as a humble entrepreneur with a humble model . " I built my record company like McDonald 's and Wendy 's : The customer is always right . " <p> So , as P built his label out of the No Limit store , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rap CDs . " Ever since I grew up in the ghetto , I knew everybody wants more - no matter what it is - for their money . That 's the marketing tool I use . When you think of No Limit , you know we going to give you more for your money . We could just give them 10 songs , but why not give them 17 , 18 or 19 , you know ? Because if you sit on them songs , they 're going to get old , anyway . I mean , I own three studios . I could make a song a day if I wanted to , so it ai n't like I 'm running out of material . " <p> P does have material , but clearly there 's less fire in his belly than he had at the time of his 1993 debut , The Ghettos Tryin to Kill Me ! , or the next year 's hardcore 99 Ways to Die ( " I carry an extra clip . . . ca n't even trust my chick " ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ songs like Ghetto D 's " Gangstas Need Love . " When P goes hardcore now , it 's more likely to be with his spinoff group , TRU ( The Real Untouchables ) . On their 1995 album , True , he introduced his concept of being " ' bout it " - " down to do whatever is necessary " to succeed - in the track " Bout It , Bout It . " That song featured a screed from rapper Mia X , whose fervor at the recording session seemed fueled by the death that very week - by gunshot to the head - of her best girlfriend . A savvy mixture of South Central gangster funk and heavy Oakland beats , it also stroked his New Orleans constituency with a patch of " bounce " rhythm - the beat that was inescapable on the Louisiana scene before P took over . TRU was quite openly modeled on N.W.A , without the fault lines : " I seen how these groups started breaking up as they got bigger . I said , man , if I start a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , because we all a family - blood brothers , " P says . <p> Master P 's signature collection , the 20-track Ice Cream Man , seemed to tell his story , but by now his past as a street pusher has become a metaphor for his bold ( and lucrative ) move into entrepreneurship . Ice cream was a synonym for crack and , in turn , for any product . As is the case with Ghetto D , whose title was contracted from " ghetto dope " so the CD could sell in Middle American store bins , P insists he was presenting a documentary-style cautionary tale about life in the hood : " People need to listen to everything , because my music is like a movie . All my music has a message . It comes down to a wake-up call . People have to realize it 's time to put the guns down . We losing a lot of black people in our community . " <p> Nearly 30 strong , master P and his No Limit soldiers move through the New Orleans airport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mystikal ; the New Orleans hit maker is not from the C but has a strong connection with P that may derive from his own loss - Mystikal 's sister Michelle , who saw him through his struggling years , was killed in 1994 by her boyfriend , Damion Neville . ( In a sad local irony , Damion is the grandson of Neville Brothers mainstay Charles . ) Mystikal 's new album , Unpredictable , contains a tribute to Michelle ( " Shine " ) and a song addressed to Damion ( " Murderer2 " ) . Now that he 's " on the tank " ( the No Limit logo is a tank with a pair of rifle-toting soldiers poking out ) , says Mystikal , he feels a kinship , rooted in loss , with P : " It 's a strong family bond . I pick up stuff from him every day . That 's how strong of a leadership he presents . " And the essence of that leadership ? " You 've got to take life more seriously - that 's definitely a lesson that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . <p> P , who has played shows in Florida and South Carolina over the weekend , is due back on the film set in Los Angeles this morning . ( His wife and children , whom he declines to discuss for security reasons , seldom travel with him . ) P got some bad news from the C last night . " There was a killing in the projects , " he says . Word is , some youngsters ( " knuckleheads , " P calls them ) from the rival Magnolia project paid back a dis with bullets . Such incidents are one reason P is seldom seen in his old hood these days . He lives several miles away , near Lake Pontchartrain , in a defensible brick compound with a driveway full of cars , including a Jag , a Benz , a Ferrari , a Land Cruiser and a Bentley . <p> I got the hook up , " ( budgeted at $3 million ) is nearly complete . P is bankrolling the project himself , and he 's been talking to major studios about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best film-distribution deal you can get , " he says . " I have several companies with bids on the table now . I guess they figured , if you can sell that many videos , there must be an audience out there for you , so it 's time to jump on board . " <p> The N'awlins-L.A. nonstop loses an engine midflight . As the plane prepares to make an unscheduled landing in Dallas , dumping a stream of spare fuel into the sky , P calmly wanders back from first class to check on his soldiers . He 'll be late to the set today , and that will cost him production money out of his own pocket . He could have shared the cost of making I Got the Hook Up by partnering with a studio . But that would n't be P 's way : " I already got more money than I need . Why do n't I just wait ? " <p> It 's true : If he does wait to cut a deal with the finished film in hand , he 'll earn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 've got to keep focused , " says P , " and you 've got to know you 're in it for the long term . You 've got to take stuff one step at a time . Look where we at now . One day , I 'm going to have everything I could ever want . It looked like a dream , but I 'm going to make it reality , because there ai n't no limit . " <p> Master P 's normally direct gaze clouds over for a moment behind his gold-rimmed spectacles . " I mean , my grandmother , even though she looked out for us , she had to take care of her own 12 kids , " he says . " I seen kids in my house with Christmas toys , and I did n't have nothing - but there was love there . That 's just how it goes . And that 's really where the No Limit thing came from - I said , ' Man , one day I 'm going to change this .
