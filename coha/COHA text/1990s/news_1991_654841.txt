<p> ONE year after Violeta Barrios de Chamorro was inaugurated as president , Nicaragua remains a country in crisis . <p> Sandinista strikers continue to snarl government operations . Chaos reigns in the countryside , as ex-contra and ex-Sandinista soldiers alike illegally seize land . With more than 60 percent of the population in poverty and 40 percent unemployed , Nicaragua 's economic situation is desperate . <p> All of which , observers here say , still represents progress . <p> On the anniversary of her first year in power , Mrs. Chamorro faces an array of problems that would daunt any government . So far , she has failed to deliver on her promise of economic recovery . And the peace she helped establish is tenuous . <p> Yet , in its first year , her administration can take credit for having made significant progress , including important steps to demilitarize the nation , open its economy , and , perhaps most important , heal the wounds of a war that left tens of thousands of Nicaraguans dead . <p> " What Violeta Chamorro wants above all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she has accomplished an astonishing amount to put the country on that path , " says a Latin American diplomat here . <p> Santiago Murray , coordinator of a relief effort led by the Organization of American States , says : " If you consider the shape this country was in , the change in the last year has been dramatic . " <p> It has not been an easy job , nor is it near complete . The nation Chamorro inherited last April was practically bankrupt ; living standards in the last 10 years have plunged to the levels of the 1930s . Stunned by their election defeat , members of the the outgoing Sandinista leadership sacked the government before leaving , turning over a bureaucracy that was both recalcitrant and disorganized . The police and Army remained under their control . <p> Chamorro 's decision to confront these problems by forming an alliance with moderate Sandinistas remains controversial . The continued presence of Humberto Ortega Saavedra , brother of former President Daniel Ortega Saavedra , as Army chief , has alienated the conservative wing of the 14-party coalition that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would make a change , not have a co-government . This is not what she originally offered , " says Gilberto Cuadra , president of COSEP , the country 's private enterprise council . <p> Adds Candida Gentzschein , a widow who voted for Chamorro : " Violeta has been too soft ... The Ortegas still have power . They have the guns . " <p> In some ways , however , the alliance is paying off . By joining with the more moderate wing of the Sandinista National Liberation Front , Chamorro appears to have coopted the opposition , contributing to its disarray . Evidence of divisions among the Sandinistas surfaced most recently with the government 's March 3 announcement of economic austerity measures . While the Sandinist National Liberation Front generally backed the program , the unions it traditionally controls responded with strikes . <p> " The Sandinista Party is in a dilemma . This is the most friendly government they can have . It 's not in their interest to see it fall , " says Emilio Alvarez , a Conservative Party politician . " But they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers . " <p> Chamorro says General Ortega 's presence has helped her to make significant reductions in the Sandinista Army , which has been cut to 28,000 members from about 80,000 a year ago . Though the armed forces ' allegiance is still in question , the president appears to be slowly consolidating her authority over these Sandinista-trained institutions . Earlier this year , the police forcibly removed Sandinista strikers from customs offices on government orders , a sharp contrast to their performance last July , when some members of the force actually helped Sandinista strikers build barricades . <p> " Violeta is getting there , " says a Bush administration official . " It may not be as fast as many in her country would like ... but she 's getting there . " <p> Yet , she also has a long way to go . Though the United States-supported contra rebels have been demobilized and 22,500 former fighters and their families repatriated , the situation in the countryside remains combustible . <p> Nearly 7,000 ex-contras are still waiting to receive land , and with the approach of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urgent . Clashes with Sandinista cooperatives are common , and the unsolved murder of former Contra military chief Enrique Berm156dez in Managua on Feb. 16 has raised tensions . <p> About 150 ex-contras reportedly returned to the mountains to take up arms following the killing . Though an official familiar with the group points to its action as an " isolated thing , " he characterizes parts of northern Nicaragua as a tinderbox . <p> Of even greater concern is Nicaragua 's prostrate economy , which has continued to deteriorate , with production falling 5.7 percent last year and inflation totaling 13,500 percent . Facing dire conditions , Nicaragua 's poor wonder if the government has forgotten them . <p> " Violeta promised at the beginning to help us , " says Candida Mayorquin , who lives in the ruins of Managua 's old California shopping center , washing fellow squatters ' clothes to make ends meet . " But the truth is I have n't seen her face around here . " <p> In Washington last week , the president finally moved closer to solving one of her biggest economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Development Bank and the World Bank . <p> During a state visit by Chamorro , the first by a Nicaraguan president since 1939 , President Bush promised to help Nicaragua clear up the debt . <p> Meanwhile , Chamorro continues her balancing act , juggling demands of Nicaragua 's formerly warring factions with slim resources . Until Nicaragua 's economy is boosted , even the peace she helped establish is tenuous . <p> " There 's an equilibrium now , but it 's unstable , " says author Oscar Ren Vargas . " There are strikes , there 's pressure from the contras , there 's pressure from COSEP . It 's like an active volcano . It 's not erupting , but if you look in the crater it 's boiling . "
