Foolish Questions <p> How did the bums meet ? Dear reader , you are of a rather cumbersome curiosity By the Devil what does it matter how the bums met ? But if you insist we will tell you that they met by chance , like everyone else . <p> What are their names ? What do you care ? Does it matter if their names are Sam &; Ace or Um &; Laut or Blank &; Blank or F &; C ? They are bums , and that 's what they should be called <p> Where do they come from ? The nearest place . No , that 's wrong The farthest place . <p> Where are they going ? Does one really know where one is going ? <p> What are they saying ? Bum One is saying nothing . He is listening to Bum Two who is saying that everything that happens to them here on earth , good or bad , is written above . <p> The Turncoats <p> Between them the bums can speak and/or understand Turkish , French , Erse , Japanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Italian , Hebrew , Dutch , Spanish , Yiddish , and even Ladino , that lovely little language which the Sephardim invented after they were kicked out of Spain a few times ago . <p> But none of these has worked . The bums are lost in a big city , and no one has any idea what they are trying to say , it 's a bad dream . <p> They make a hand gesture which they believe is the international sign for being lost , for distress , but from every person in this city to whom they perform this gesture all they get in return is the bite of the thumb , a gesture they do not understand a fig . <p> It is not understand a fig . <p> What is then , Schmartie ? <p> It 's give a fig . <p> What does it mean ? <p> Du n no . <p> The old bums are lost , they are lost and tired . They are lost and tired and hungry . They are lost and hungry and thirsty and tired . <p> Fooled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fooled you , did n't I ? <p> You just said that . <p> You expected a certain order based on expectation in the last run of sentences , did n't you ? <p> I 'm tired . <p> I am tired and thirsty . <p> We 're lost <p> The bums sit on a bench . What a lovely city , a small city somewhere , it looks like the western Argentine . What a lovely city , a small city somewhere in the Argentine , or in the Crimea , or in the Persian Alps . But still , provincial beauty notwithstanding , they can not make themselves understood . And every time they try , the folk bite their thumbs . <p> The smaller of the two bums takes off his coat . He turns this coat inside out and puts it on again . Looks ridiculous , all the bits of stuffing and loose thread and stitching are exposed You do likewise , he says to the fat bum . Turn your coat inside out . <p> But it is embarrassing , and very uncomfortable <p> Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a lost kid who did this . <p> So , what happened to him ? <p> I do n't know , she died before she could finish the story . <p> That fast ? <p> It was a long story . <p> Oh , well then . Fat bum turns his coat inside out while Small Bum steps behind the bench to reverse his trousers <p> Here they sit then , dear Reader , the inside-out gang , our two lost bums , two turncoats on a bench somewhere on earth . What do you suppose happens next ? Or do you suppose the bums are already saved ? It is up to you to finish the tale . <p> This and That <p> One summer day , the bums at their ease on a park bench , their grand-kids scooting about in the sandbox , on the monkey bars , the sun flooding down , they got to talking about their own parents <p> Bum 2 inquired , How did your old man die ? <p> Bum 1 answered , In bed , in extreme old age , shouting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I remember now your telling me that , years ago , years ago . I forgot , said Bum 2 . <p> What about your father , asked Bum 1 , how did he go ? <p> He was burned alive in a furnace , Bum 2 explained calmly . There are records of this . <p> Ah , yes , yes , I remember now your telling me this , years ago , years ago . I forgot , said Bum 1 . <p> The Beauty of Loneliness <p> Loneliness is a natural state , says Old Guy One , I believe in loneliness beyond life , when we feel lonely among our friends it is only a presentiment of our lonely future or an aftertaste of our lonely past . <p> Quite right , replies Old Guy Two , and I would add that since everything except loneliness is parenthetical , a passing perturbation , then loneliness is security . <p> I 'll go further than that , says Old Guy One , hell is a nightmare without loneliness , without calm , without consistency , therefore loneliness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old Guy Two , too much distance or too much closeness is loneliness , that is the beauty of loneliness , and that is why loneliness is a natural state . <p> The Story of the Sparrow <p> This is what Bum One told Bum Two as they were traveling by train from Budapest to Bucharest on their tour of East European countries . <p> Ahmed Souliaman , a Siberian Tartar , told the Story of the Sparrow to Vasily Michailowitch Tolmatchoff who spent twenty years in a Siberian Gulag , Tolmatchoff told the story to Tiberiu Paskuy of Roumania who spent seven years in jail where he met Mircea Cartarescu who also spent seven years in jail for having written subversive poetry , and while in jail Tiberiu told Mircea the Story of the Sparrow , in turn Mircea after he got out of jail told that story to Gezim Hadj of Albania who after having been tortured and condemned to death for refusing to kiss the feet of the President of Albania managed to escape to Roumania and there met Mircea who told him the Story of the Sparrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eventually after wandering for eight years Gezim ended up in Czechoslovakia where one of his cousins had also escaped , and there in Prague Gezim told his cousin Peter the Story of the Sparrow who then told it to his best friend Ivo Hlavizna , a young dissident who had almost been killed by a Russian tank when the Russian tanks rolled into Prague , Ivo met Maciej Swierkocki from Lodz on a train traveling from Prague to Moscow where both were going to attend a conference on Ways to Improve Your Life in the Socialist World , and Ivo told Maciej the story of the Sparrow , and so during the conference Maciej then told the story to Jerzy Patkowski , a friend he had not seen in years because Jerzy had been in jail for twelve years for reasons which were never revealed to him , and when Jerzy whom everyone called Jurek got back home to Krakow he told the story to Andreij Slominski who during World War Two helped Jews escape from the death camps , and Andreij told the story to Namredef X a survivor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Sparrow , and now I will tell you that story , and perhaps after you have heard it you too may want to tell it to a friend , or even to an enemy . This is THE STORY OF THE SPARROW : <p> On a beautiful winter day in Siberia , encouraged by the warm rays of the sun in a clear blue sky , a little sparrow left the security of his nest to fly and frolic in the air , but the 40deg-below-zero temperature quickly overcame the imprudent bird who fell to the ground , frozen , and found himself buried in the snow where he certainly would have died in an instant . By chance a cow trotted by , and at the very spot where the sparrow was struggling for his last breath , she dropped a large soft cow-dung on top of the bird . The warmth of this dung-bath resuscitated the moribund sparrow . He was so happy , he raised his head out of the cow-shit and started to twitter joyfully , which drew the attention of a wandering homeless cat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devoured him . <p> The moral of this story : Your enemy is not necessarily the one who shits on your head . Your friend , however , is not necessarily the one who pulls you out of the shit . And besides , one should not twitter when one is buried in shit . <p> After listening to the story of the sparrow Bum Two said to his friend , you know , you 're not a bad storyteller , but sometimes I think you 're full of shit , because you make up things as you go along . <p> Commentaries on the Story of the Sparrow <p> After a long moment of reflection , while the train meandered through the Transylvanian Alps , Bum Two turned to Bum One and said : <p> From prehomeric times this tale has been a constant , a fate tale . One aspect of it is the good in the bad . Ullie is captured by a wild beauty while on his way home to Penny , and has no choice but to refresh himself on such fair island flesh . Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes mere mortals off the moral hook , necessity is always the ubervirtue , if you ca n't be with the one you love , love the one you 're with . The modern antihero Namredef X proves the point again . Left to rot in a closet with only a sack of his own shit to warm him was the true provenance of a life which was subsequently charmed to the degree that it was threatened . We now jump to the Old Testament where we learn that losing is the condition of finding . A further throw on this story is that it has been a classic of the oppressed who of all other gruppens have been sustained by its paradoxes . We do n't think of Alexander the Macedonian gay commander as oppressed , but such was always the case no matter his victories . Steeped in shit , he warbled and twittered as the lead in his flagon leached into the wine . X 's story , however , remains untold , fate has yet to reveal her last act to us for him . But to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historical parable of the sparrow , which is here to tell us that it is endless . Love the one you 're with . <p> Bum One shook his head : and you tell me I 'm full of shit <p> Winter Wheat <p> One day , the bums <p> let 's call them the two old men for this occasion <p> went out on a familiar walk . A good mile through a stand of old oak , down the steep cut to the sixty-year-old steel bridge , its rusting structure suggesting a monument to something <p> we know not what <p> , and thence northward along the railroad tracks , in file , silently <p> heads bowed , eyes to the ground <p> into the fog collecting , rising . <p> Slowly along the winding deer path downward toward the tracks they went , each with a walking stick <p> hand-carved , it should be noted , for the sake of harmony <p> , in file through the dark woods , over the wet compact of <p> dead <p> leaves , late in the day , late in November @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old men trudging along . <p> The smaller , slighter of the two <p> and older perhaps by a couple of years <p> first , leading , the larger one <p> larger not only in stature but also in posture <p> following , neither one a leader or a follower but rather taking up those positions naturally , as , for instance , brothers might , although in that case a competitive tension would be likely present <p> since brothers are usually more inclined to be enemies than friends <p> . <p> In old <p> tattered <p> overcoats , hats <p> that of the smaller one greenish , that of the larger one brownish <p> , and gloves <p> nondescript <p> , carrying sticks fashioned rudely <p> by hand , as already noted , probably with a pocketknife <p> from windfall limbs , the old men proceeded northward <p> in truth , more northeastward <p> along the ties , both noting a band of green <p> the fog intensifying its green <p> ; a passing grain car had obviously sown this field of winter wheat , now a healthy three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and on the ties as well <p> if this notion can be maintained <p> The one ahead stooped , pulled a few shoots out of the rocks , rubbed them between his fingers , then threw them down <p> correction : scattered them into the air <p> What each man was thinking can not be revealed <p> how can it be ? Stream of consciousness went out of business long ago <p> . It could be that they were thinking nothing , that the movement , the occasion , was occupying them completely <p> nothing is more real than nothing <p> . Their walk , then , could have been not unlike prayer <p> this is just a wild guess <p> , a form of prayer , a rhythmic ritual muttering of ancient verses <p> yes , much better , ancient verses <p> , verses collapsed into meaninglessness <p> yes <p> , meaningless and , therefore , valuable syllables <p> But what they are thinking does not matter much , they are <p> the shift to the present tense here is deliberate for the sake of immediacy <p> , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generative illusion <p> nicely said <p> , freed to exist plainly in a larger field <p> of winter wheat <p> , their lives their own , for a while <p> The old men walking along , ahead of them another bridge rising into the fog bank , and beyond it on a siding , a line of boxcars <p> digression : as he glances at the boxcars the smaller one recalls , for no specific reason , that in France , boxcars carry this inscription : 40 hommes ou 20 chevaux <p> . They pass the tail of a squirrel on a tie between the rails , a complete tail neatly severed at its base <p> this to point out that animals too like to indulge in railroad tracks <p> . Each man inspects the <p> loose <p> tail briefly with his stick , poking at it <p> it is dry , dead <p> . <p> The slighter man , wiry , tough , picks up a stone from the railroad bed and hurls it at a rotting disconnected telegraph pole The larger man comes alongside and fires his stone at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sake of accuracy that the smaller man throws with his left hand while the larger man throws with his right <p> , This contest continues until each man has hit the pole several times <p> neither man , however , can be declared the winner , for it was not a competition , just a little game <p> . <p> Then they proceed , in file again , but this time the larger man ahead for awhile , then dropping back , taking up the position in which he can keep himself organized , can keep himself from collapsing <p> although the larger one is younger , by a couple of years , as noted earlier , he is not in as good a physical condition as the smaller one who daily practices the art of t'ai chi <p> , guiding himself by reference to the figure <p> the more athletic figure <p> ahead , by the cold steel of the continuous rail , by the tender shoots of winter wheat . <p> To the man ahead have come a few words , not even a complete line , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sudden pain from a deep muscle , ineinander verkrallt <p> it could be Trakl , but this can not be ascertained <p> . The man pauses a second , half turns his head as if to check on the other old man . As he moves forward , the words form again , in his body <p> words are not always spoken aloud by the mouth <p> , ineinander verkrallt ... ineinander verkrallt ... ineinander verkrallt ... echoing inside of him . <p> Near the middle of the second bridge over the stream , the old men take a piss <p> they do not remove their gloves to hold on to their cocks while pissing . It is a cold day <p> Down through the dark stand of oak , following the deer trail , over the wet compacted dead leaves , the old men went . <p> Here the return to the past tense is deemed essential to disrupt the chronology and monotony of this winter walk in the winter wheat <p> Down the cut by the bridge they went , and then northward <p> more or less <p> on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon , into the lowering fog , into the obscured evening . Along the railroad track in single file they proceeded until , beyond the second bridge , they came upon a string of boxcars on a siding . <p> This encounter with the string of boxcars is so important that no intrusions will disrupt the rest of this paragraph , or for that matter the next two paragraphs <p> These they began to inspect , peering into the doorway of each open car , examining each one carefully , as if they expected to find something there . Although , perhaps this gesture was merely the idle curiosity of old men , old men who gaze without interest at whatever presents itself , at whatever lies before them . <p> One of the boxcars was made of wood , like the others dramatically spray-painted by disenfranchised youth in distant cities , magnificent , huge Day-Glo letters of the alphabet so artfully designed as to obscure their origin . Into this wooden boxcar the smaller of the two men jumped . Then he turned and reaching out to his friend he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of heavily splintered wood . Both doors drawn open . Empty , only a few strands of baling wire , flat bands of black steel . Sitting down , using each other 's back for support , the men took up position The one facing the west door , the other the east . <p> Here they sat in silence for a long time , for an unusually long time <p> intrusion : it is difficult to establish how long an unusually long time is <p> Here they sat relaxed , quietly , not moving . Inwardly , as children sit in a kitchen near their mother  --  with mother , as she prepares supper . Here they sat back to back <p> in silence , except for the sound of their breathing <p> , the fog gathering , lowering , weaving through the boxcar , inhabiting the space with the old men . <p> On a rail nearby paused a red-tailed fox , one paw on the rail , the other hovering , as if feeling something , alert to the presence of the old men , its nostrils in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> By pure blind association , since from where he sat he could not possibly see the fox on the railroad track , a few words of a fable <p> he once knew by heart <p> surged in the smaller man 's body : Un vieux Renard , mais des plus fins ... Fut enfin au piege attrape . <p> The larger man must have felt in his body that something was speaking inside his friend . He did not say anything , but with his back he pressed a bit harder on his friend 's back <p> Before they jumped down to the railroad bed , the old men tried to decipher <p> their one communal act on that day , except for the deliberate pressure of the back of the one against the other <p> the remnants of words cut into the wood at one end of the boxcar . The closed curve of a T or perhaps an E , the angle of an L or a B. <p> Strange how long they inspected the few bits of words cut into the wood , bits of letters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carving of a heart pierced by an arrow , only letters , remnants of words . <p> Standing at the wall <p> squinting <p> in the act of study , the old men inspected , much longer than by any compass seemed necessary . <p> Then the old men climbed out of the car and retraced their steps , back to the place where they had begun <p> up the hill <p> , walking in file , as before , the fog steady , unchanged , the wind still , things much as they were <p> earlier , during the descent <p> . Along the green ribbon of winter wheat glowing between the rails , over the first bridge , then up the steeply cut embankment <p> the old men puffing a little now <p> to the deer path winding through some woods <p> Then along this path , over the soft wet compacted <p> dead <p> leaves , and then , from the valley came the burgeoning blunt sound of diesel engines pulling a heavy load , diesel engines hard at work , that deep powerful throbbing strain of diesel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil <p> That first , then that , accompanied by the sound of rolling stock , of steel wheels on the steel tracks . <p> Impoverished ironies stretch endless as continuously forged steel rails back and forth , hin und her , back into time and through time to nothing and beyond that place to nothing more , and to here , here to this empty text <p> full of intrusions <p> , and then to more , forever ineinander verkrallt ... enfin au piege attrape . <p> Making a Distinction <p> The two displaced bums are having a friendly discussion about what exactly a Schlemiel is , a name they often call each other . <p> Displaced Bum One gives this definition : A Schlemiel is someone who breaks his thumb in his vest pocket . <p> That 's not a Schlemiel , exclaims D. B. Two , that 's a Schlimazel A Schlemiel , he goes on to explain , is someone who falls on his back and breaks his nose . <p> A Quiet Evening at Home <p> The old guys are spending a quiet evening at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which today stays open till nine o'clock . <p> Bum One is reading a book , Two improvising at the piano , a little jazz solo ( believe it or not , our two bums are jazz fanatics ) . <p> Bum One looks up from his book and calls out to his friend : Hey , stop a minute and listen to this . <p> Two stops playing , and swivels around on the piano stool . <p> Bum One reads from the book : The truth may be found in the eyes of our wives , it says here . <p> Who wrote that ? asks Two . <p> Goethe , informs One , pointing to a page in his book . <p> Goethe Well , this may indeed be so , but who among us has the courage to look ? mumbles Two as he swivels back to the piano and hits a B-flat chord with one hand . <p>
