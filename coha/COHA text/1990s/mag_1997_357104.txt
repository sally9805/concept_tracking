Fitful irritation and gossip , gusting to contempt ; jealousy , plotting and backbiting , holding steady at obsessional hatred and spasms of baroque fury , with likelihood of budget cuts : this is the wind chart , as any veteran of the higher-ed dodge can attest , of collegial relations in a well-ordered university English department . Or so say the profs who write about such matters in satirical novels , most of them set on campuses not readily distinguishable from their own . <P> The latest and one of the funniest of these vengeful academic burlesques is Richard Russo 's Straight Man ( Random House ; 391 pages ; $25 ) . Russo , a former professor at Colby College in Maine and author of The Risk Pool and Nobody 's Fool , commences his slapstick when William Henry Devereaux Jr. , creative-writing teacher and chairman of the English department at an obscure Pennsylvania college , makes a slighting remark about a colleague 's poetry . She whacks him across the face with a notebook , and the metal coil hooks his nose . <P> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fight departmental budget wars with dignity . He has an unsatisfactory negotiation with the campus executive officer , a lizard whose " carefully calculated sincerity is almost indistinguishable from the real thing . " This fellow , of course , is bent on downsizing what once was called the liberal arts . Devereaux rebels , and with TV cameras churning ( dignitaries are cutting the ribbon for a grand new engineering complex ) , he grabs a goose from the campus pond and threatens to kill it and another like it every day until the English department gets its funding . <P> We are n't meant to believe any of this , merely to admire the purity of Devereaux 's distilled exasperation , brought on by years of departmental politics and " the increasingly militant ignorance " of students . He was once a well-reviewed writer , though of only one book , and that short stories . But rather than agonize over their descent into professorial mediocrity , he and his colleagues , he decides , have " chosen , wisely perhaps , to be angry with each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when one addled prof goes off his medication and resumes cross-dressing , so is the counseling he receives : no pearls before 5 p.m . <P>  --  By John Skow
