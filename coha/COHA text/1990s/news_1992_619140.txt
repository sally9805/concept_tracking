<p> First there was Victorian sex ( " just lie back and think of England " ) , then there was free sex , then there was safe sex . And now there is celibacy , a word being bandied about by everyone from a presidential candidate to a cabaret singer to a Bay Area columnist who went public with her story on the Sally Jessy Raphael show last fall . <p> Mildred Penn Lee , a 46-year-old Richmond teacher , says she has not been intimate with a man since 1987 . Lee , who is divorced with two grown children , says " celibacy is character building . It allows concentration on the development of the person as a person . " <p> " What celibacy does for you is make you less dependent upon the drive and able to concentrate more on the need ( for love ) , which is much more fulfilling and long-lasting . It 's like the difference between eating a bowl of pasta as opposed to a piece of cake . The cake tastes good . It goes into your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> SHE STILL FEELS SEXUAL <p> It 's not that Lee , who writes on women 's issues for several small newspapers , does n't care for sex . In fact , she says , quite the opposite is true . <p> " To me , celibacy does not mean you have lost your sexuality . I am a highly sexual person . But I turn down dates with men when I feel there are no prospects for the future . " <p> Well , does n't she miss having sex ? <p> " I do not miss the disappointment if he does n't call . I do n't miss the games . I will do without the sex and miss the games you have to play . " <p> NOT AN ABERRATION <p> Although few people would appear on national television with similar stories , Lee 's lifestyle may no longer be that unusual . <p> Singer and pianist Michael Feinstein says the fear of AIDS has turned him celibate . <p> " I do n't have sex , " he told a Hollywood columnist . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . . . . Being in my 30s , sex is not as important to me . " <p> A famous ( and married ) clothing designer visiting San Francisco recently turned down invitations to bar hop , saying he was celibate . <p> Magic Johnson first advocated safe sex after his announcement that he was HIV-positive . Two weeks later he changed his mind and now advocates celibacy for singles . <p> Presidential candidate Bob Kerrey of Nebraska lusts only in his heart these days . Kerrey , who is divorced , told the country last month he would not date during the campaign , mostly to keep the press off his back . He admitted it was n't an easy decision . " It 's lonely out here , " he told reporters in New Hampshire . <p> A 42-year-old San Francisco woman who did not want to be identified says she has gone as long as four years without a sexual relationship , opting to wait for a man who was both sexually and emotionally right for her , rather than kiss a lot of frogs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her celibacy has to do in part with AIDS , but more about finding a peacefulness within herself about being alone . <p> " I think it is very important for everyone , men and women , at some point in their lives , to spend time by themselves to get to know who they are , what their needs are and what they are looking for . I think that 's very , very important , instead of running around trying to fill up empty spaces within themselves with casual sex . " <p> Lifelong celibacy is best left to priests and nuns , and is not a realistic option for the rest of society , most people say . <p> " For most adults it 's a nonissue , " says Marty Klein of Palo Alto , a licensed marriage and family counselor , sex therapist and author of two books on sexuality . <p> " The issues are about expressing your sexuality . One of the universal challenges of adulthood is finding appropriate , satisfying and self-affirming ways of expressing your sexuality . Some people choose to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever again . But that 's very , very , very rare . " <p> But the grim reality of AIDS , coupled with the idea that we have to be wrapped in latex from head to toe , may explain the responses of American Health magazine readers , who seemed rather turned off by the whole idea of sex . <p> One in three of the respondents of a recent survey said they have watched TV during sex . Nearly half said they would be happier about winning $ 2,500 than having a weekend of hot sex . Said a 44- year-old man : " If I had to choose between sex and working out , I would choose working out . " <p> Most say they would not give up sex completely for any amount of money . But of those who say they would , the asking price was $ 4 million to $ 5 million . <p> OK , OK , $ 3.5 million , but not a penny less . <p> PICKY ABOUT PARTNERS <p> On the other hand , San Francisco 's underground sex clubs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for those in their 20s who are still primarily led by their hormones , sex is still an alternative to pigging out with a half-gallon of ice cream . <p> After visiting some singles bars last week , we discovered that while lifelong celibacy is n't an option in the minds of those in their 30s and 40s , they were willing to talk candidly about the idea of abstinence and monogamy . <p> " Monogamy is the option of choice , " says Ken Cruz , 30 , a commercial real estate lender in San Francisco . " You 're just more careful who you select . You wait a long , long time . " <p> A 26-year-old woman says the fact that she has n't had a sexual relationship lately has more to do with not finding the right person than with trying out celibacy . <p> " My married sister says I should be celibate . She 's worried about AIDS . I said , ' That 's easy for you to say when you 're not out there in the single world . ' " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McCready , who was having a glass of wine with a friend at Harry Denton 's , was tantamount to assuming you would be a priest someday . " So celibacy definitely crossed my mind , " he says . <p> Later on , as a teenager , he heard the whispered horror stories about gonorrhea , syphilis and unwanted pregnancies . Now , at 42 , he says , " you might go a longer time between relationships . For me , it 's more emotional than a fear of AIDS . You are a lot more in tune with who you are and who it is you might get involved with . " <p> Steve , a 36-year-old banker , says his dating patterns have definitely changed in the past few years . " Now , I 'm sometimes the one who is walking out the door at 2 a.m. saying , ' No , thank you . ' " <p> And a 43-year-old lawyer having a late dinner alone at Fringale restaurant , says he , too , has changed his attitude about casual sex , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with how I have sex , not who I have sex with . It has nothing to do with it . I want to get to know who this person is first . I 'm not either for or against celibacy , but I do think it 's a big mistake to have sex too early in a relationship . " <p> TAKING TIME OUT <p> Tedde Rinker , a Mountain View psychiatrist , one of six leaders of the Sex , Love and Intimacy workshops given by the Human Awareness Institute in San Mateo , says more and more people are talking to her about abstinence . <p> " I see a trend toward people in the 30s and 40s experimenting with the concept of wanting to take a period of time not to be in the pursuit of sexual contacts . I see it all the time in the workshops , " Rinker says . <p> Going without sex will do little to alter your health ; the most serious consequence , called " widower 's syndrome " happens to men when the spirit is willing , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be corrected through therapy . <p> Women , too , may experience some physical problems , such as narrowing of the vagina ( which can also happen after menopause ) . Women who regularly have sex have wider vaginas and healthier vaginal tissues , according to Health magazine . <p> But Dr. Tom Lue , associate professor of urology at the University of California San Francisco Medical Center , says he is not aware of any scientific studies of adverse physiological effects from celibacy . <p> " We know that a lot of religious people do n't have sex and nothing bad happens to them . They usually live longer lives . " <p> Loss of desire , which can result from emotional upheaval , may simply require temporarily putting aside sexuality until you feel stronger . The connotation , however , is that anyone who begs off sex for long periods of time is a withered up and useless member of society . <p> " These are times in a person 's life when you may not be fully available to engage in a relationship , " says Marty Klein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense for a person to make a decision not to have a physical involvement . " <p> AURAL GRATIFICATION <p> That brings us to phone sex . <p> One of the hottest-selling books in Bay Area bookstores right now is an engrossing , erotic novel called " Vox , " by Nicholson Baker . Nothing is left out of Baker 's rendition of an hours-long , uninterrupted phone sex conversation between a man in a Western city and a woman 3,000 miles away . <p> The book  --  which is No. 8 on the New York Times best-seller list  --  is right on target for the less-sex ' 90s . <p> " I think computer sex and phone sex are going to become much more common in the years to come because we have the technology for it and because it fits into the trend that is developing of people having much more cautious partner sex , " says Alan Brauer , a psychiatrist and director of the Brauer Medical Center in Palo Alto . <p> Which then brings us to cyber sex  --  where you and your computer mate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by stimulating the brain waves through computer or phone networks . ( Unfortunately , this means you both have to wear some sort of headgear , but it does n't matter since you ca n't see each other anyway . ) <p> A postcard that has been circulating around some offices reads : <p> ' 50s : No Sex <p> ' 60s : Free Sex <p> ' 70s : More Sex <p> ' 80s : Corporate Sex <p> ' 90s : Safe Sex <p> 2000 : Cyber Sex <p> " Given the increasing availability of computer sex and virtual reality , this could be quite interesting , " says Brauer . " Through the technology , people are going to be able to produce unlimited types of sexual situations . With virtual reality , you can imagine yourself in any physical place and put a person in there with you . <p> " There already is some concern that it could produce an addictive behavior , even worse than that of computer games . It takes away a lot of the need to have partner sex . But there could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The optimum reason to have sex  --  as an expression of intimacy of caring and love  --  is not why most people have sex . So we 're not doing too well in that regard anyway . "
