I 've never been a sucker for freebies , knowing all too well that they 're usually more hassle than they 're worth . So when I heard about all the new free-PC offers , I could n't help wincing . Companies like Gobi , Intersquid and ePCdirect require you to pay up to $30 a month for Net access and are rife with hidden fees for basics like a monitor , tech support and one-time " start-up " charges . And then there 's the nagging fear that these newcomers will vanish into cyberspace long before your three-year contract is up . Would you really want to do business with a company called Enchilada ? Actually , you ca n't anymore , since it stopped taking orders in early July , less than three months after it was rolled out . <P> Yet one deal tempted even cynical me . Free-PC is offering 333-MHz Compaq PCs with full Internet and e-mail access to anyone willing to fill out a questionnaire , watch ads onscreen and use the computer for 10 hrs. a month . No hidden fees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keyboard . But hold on : Who in her right mind would suffer through a barrage of onscreen ads just to get a free computer ? Or submit to all sorts of prying personal questions , down to your income ? Next thing you know , these " free " computers might be coming with built-in video cameras to monitor your off-line activities . It would be an Orwellian nightmare , downright evil . <P> But when my test computer arrived , I was pleasantly surprised that the blinking ads that filled the bottom and right side of my screen hardly bothered me . Sure , they reduced the usable area of the screen to the size of a large laptop 's , but I barely noticed them . There was still plenty of room left to browse websites and use the included word-processing software . What 's more , when I had trouble getting online , I got through to tech support in just 3 min . And since I 'm not a gamer , I was n't worried that my new PC lacked a 3-D graphics accelerator or top-of-the-line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pentium home PC , even this low-end model ( by today 's standards ) is a screamer . <P> But what about my principles ? Had I gone soft when presented with a gleaming new PC ? Not quite . The company had no idea I do n't drive a BMW or own a cell phone or make $150,000 per annum , contrary to my claims on the application . And I decided I did n't really care if Free-PC knew which websites I frequented , so long as it kept its promise never to tell a marketer that I log on to
