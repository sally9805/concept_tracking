History has doubly cursed the Balkans . it not only energizes the combatants in the most perverse way imaginable , it also paralyzes the would-be peacemakers . While the crisis deepens , well-intentioned outsiders ponder their options and fret about the risks in terms borrowed from other wars in other eras . <P> Vietnam is the name not just of a country but also of a syndrome from which the U.S. still suffers  --  notwithstanding Dr. Bush 's self-congratulatory claim to the contrary a little more than a year ago . Senior officials of his Administration have repeatedly defined the danger awaiting the U.S. if it leads a large-scale military intervention in the Balkans as " another Vietnam . " <P> It was partly in his overeagerness to avoid " a Vietnam-like quagmire " that Bush so abruptly suspended Desert Storm . As a result , Saddam Hussein remained in power to slaughter his citizens and rebuild his military . Thus the continuing fixation on the V word has figured decisively in the two great foreign policy failures of the Bush Administration : it was too quick to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow to mobilize a multinational intervention that might end the Balkan war . <P> As Bush and everyone else keep saying , Iraq and Yugoslavia are challenges to the post-cold war order . That realization in itself should exclude , or at least mute , references to Vietnam in the debate over how to meet those challenges . <P> Southeast Asia was the hot front of the cold war . Hanoi had the Kremlin 's backing . Serbia is not North Vietnam . It has virtually no friends and certainly no superpower godfather . The U.S. and the international community , notably including Russia , are united against what Serbia is doing . Slobodan Milosevic 's regime can be isolated politically and , if necessary , defeated militarily in a way that Ho Chi Minh 's could not . <P> The North Vietnamese and the Viet Cong were fighting to reunify a country that had been artificially divided . While they were doing so under a now discredited political banner , they still had the powerful force of nationalism on their side . The Bosnian Serbs , by contrast , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country that had been artificially unified . <P> Nor should the Bosnian Serbs be seen as the moral equivalents of their fathers and grandfathers , who tied down 30 Axis divisions a half-century ago . That analogy  --  another of the cliches that help rationalize Western dithering  --  could hardly be more misleading . It disgraces the heroism and patriotism of the Yugoslav partisans in World War II . It exaggerates the number and prowess of the Serb forces in Bosnia today , as well as their local support . For them patria is a Greater Serbia in which Croats , Albanians , Hungarians , Macedonians and Slavic Muslims are subject to second-class citizenship , if not " ethnic cleansing . " <P> Finally , all the talk about the Serb forces controlling the hilltops like latter-day Chetniks implies an invidious comparison between what the Nazis were trying to do in the 1940s and what the United Nations ought to be doing today . Hitler was bent on conquering Yugoslavia , while the West should be saving the remnants of that country from the consequences of the end of communism . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
