Evolution could be much more complicated than we think ! <p> Like its predecessors , the third Jaquino probe was unmanned . The tiny ship lifted , shimmered , vanished , six hours later shimmered again and set down quietly between the coils . Tests of the little vessel 's instruments and attachments soon proved that it had found a world that orbited a star in a binary system in a galaxy clearly not the Milky Way , and , some experts argued , not even in the local universe . Habitable ? Maybe . Everything seemed earthlike except the atmosphere , which was a blend Of COsub 2 and Nsub 2 Colonists would have to live in bubbles at first , while the COsub 2 Was being converted to Osub 2 . A matter for the Terraformers , who immediately organized a full-scale expedition in a ship especially built for the occasion : the James LovelL Joan Dickens ( Clairvoyants , Inc. ) opined that it was suicide to name a vessel for the captain of a disaster-namely , the twentieth-century Apollo Thirteen . Doom International announced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her continuum , and that time was gushing through the wound like arterial blood . Their guru cited the vision of two hands , said to symbolize an act ( or maybe omission of an act-they never really pinned him down ) to be done ( or maybe not done ) by the ship that would destroy-or save-the entire human race . One or the other Two members of the mitial expe dition staff had been detected as members of Doom and had been replaced at the last minute . When Doom expanded the potential casualty list to include the human race , then , and only then ( albeit reluctantly and skeptically ) , the Terraformer Authority took notice . As did the Authority 's major insurer , Interplanetary Mutual , who insisted that the James Lovell take their choice as captain , a well-known strict disciplinarian , namely FL . Spask , an officer of twenty years " impeccable reputation in the Luna overnights and Mars weekenders . I.M. had never had to pay a claim on a shin captained bv Smk . There was a big meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the president of Terraformers , the licensing Officer of Interplanetary Admiralty , the Secretary of State for the Cosmographers Society . I.M. did most of the talking . The Adjustors Unit had some earnest suggestions . " Follow the Rules , Spask . Do n't fritter away time and effort . Avoid distractions-yours and ... those people 's . Confiscate things , if you have to . Get in , make the tests . You should have an answer within hours . If it 's yes , start the terraforming process and get out . If it 's no , sterilize the test cultures , drop the Sagan plaque , get out . Time may be a factor . Do n't risk losing the finestra . " Fin  --  ? " " Finestra-window , Spask . A jaquino , term . Remember ? You took the crash course given by that young navigator fellow ... uh ... Bob Easley ? If it closes while you 're still out there ... well ... but with you in command , I 'm sure that wo n't happen , especially with Easley and First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Spask , " the Licensing Officer said . " And no chance to reach an understanding with your First Officer . We know that . Sorry . Could n't be helped . But we know you 'll come through . just follow the Rules . Keep their minds on the mission . No nonsense , no detours . Remember , billions are invested in this ship , and the Aw thority is entitled to a fair return on its investment . " Spask said , " I want the first liner that comes out of this program . " " And you shall have it , " they told him . " Just keep your nose clean , " the chairman of the Licensing Board added , unnecessarily . Ferrol Lester Spask . He knew what they called him behind his back : " Fearless Spask . " It did n't really bother him . The nickname had more or less created itself during hell week at the Academy Nearly all the friends and colleagues of that distant epoch had by now vanished into their own careers . Hardly anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes he thought about his nickname . He had never encountered a life-threatening situation . He wondered , would I then be Fearless ? Interesting question . Just before departure Captain Spask granted a short , rather ill-tempered interview to the media , wherein he exuded a blend of confidence and contempt . " Predictions of disaster ? it 's all ridiculous nonsense . An unmanned probe has navigated routinely to the planet Navetta and returned . It 's perfectly safe . Our team is made up of highly skilled professionalsthe best in their fields . If Navetta can be terraformed , we will do it . If it ca n't , well come home , try elsewhere . " ( Full-face , hard blue-green eyes snapping , lip curled in utter disdain . The James Lovell in the background. ) - You think eight human beings can destroy the entire human race ? You 're all crazy ! " He was a big , burly man ; he had presence ; he radiated authority . The professionals were gathered around the officers " table . " Before we strap in for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make sure we all understand our mission . I think all of you know Terraformer 's general goal : a livable planet . One we find that way , or one we can terraform . Aside from our own solar system we are not aware of any such planets . Most of the extra-solar planets probed so far have had serious flaws : gravity too high , extreme temperatures , no water ; air is toxic , and so on . We then ask , can the flaws be corrected within a reasonable time , which at present the Terraform Authority has provisionally set at one hundred years . In a word , if it is not immediately habitable , is the candidate planet nevertheless terrorinable ? " He paused , looked around the table , continued . " Our target planet for this mission , so-called Navetta , may be one such . The only problem seems to be an atmosphere of 20:80 carbon dioxide:nitrogen . If we can start converting carbon dioxide in its atmosphere to oxygen with good yield , I think we 'll be home free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with COsub 2 below five percent , will . take about eighty five years . While wait ing for the air to clear , the immigrants can live in bubbles . It 's their descendants , of course , that would reap the most benefit from our work . " He studied their faces , and his own seemed to harden . " You see on the table in front of you what will be known as the Rules of the Ship . You will follow these Rules to the letter Deviations could put the ship at risk . I will not tolerate deviations . Any questions ? " A pause , a silence . " No questions , ( is- " " I have a question , " said Virginia Oxley . He looked at her with expressionless eyes . " Ah , Dr. Oxley , our psychiatrist . Yes , your question ? " " You came to my cabin and took a print that I had hung on the wall . Captain , why did you take my picture ? " " Because it is trivia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crucial moment could harm the mission , perhaps even destroy the ship . " You personally found the drawing distracting ? " " Yes , doctor , I personally found the drawing distracting . I believe most of our personnel would agree with me . Two hands , each drawing the other ... something by a fellow named Escher , I think . Particularly distracting in view of certain well-known prophecies . Not to worry , doctor When the trip is over , you 'll have it back . " He folded his arms on his chest and regarded her with narrowed eyes . " Dr Oxley , and meaning nothing specifi cally personal , I can not imagine a professional less likely to be of use on this trip than a psychiatrist . I 'm not sure what you weigh , but I do believe that your weight should have been put in supplemental instruments aimed at ensuring ship safety . " She smiled sweetly " Captain , let us all hope that your assessment proves correct , and that future jaquino flights can dispense with the psychiatrist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Oxley interrupted him , " Not quite done , Captain . You also confiscated Mr. Easley 's music collection . May we ask why ? " Yes , glad you asked . Ms. Oxley , Mr. Easley 's collection listed a selection longbanned on the seas and in space . Today no civilized ship will carry , much less play , " Sponge d'Automne , " which was the last music played by the Titanic 's main orchestra the night the ship struck the iceberg . " Seems reasonable , thought Dr Oxley The navigator spoke up . " Okay . But how about the picture of Mark Jaquino ? You took it down from the bridge . But it was official ... it was supposed to hang them . " Captain Spask winced . Dr. Oxley suppressed a smile . She knew the photo por trait well . It had evidently been taken shortly before the famous scientist received his Nobel . The face radiated a gentle dignity Behind the dark glasses there were laugh crinkles at the eye comers , and under the sparse gray mustache the mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as though he was already savoring the furor the Processo would soon arouse in the scientific establishment . Articles had been written about his blindness . Some claimed it had opened a vast new world of space time to him and had given him the vision of the thirty-one baffling equations that contained the Jaquino Processo . Mark Jaquino had been dead for fifty years , but Dr Oxley sensed that as far as the captain was concerned the great Italian was still vibrantly alive , an incomprehensible eleven-dimensional career threat . Spask addressed the navigator with cold finality . " Suffice it to say , Mr. Easley , I found the portrait ... distracting . " Virginia Oxley was not telepathic , though from time to time she had been accused of the faculty . But she was highly skilled in reading body language , the unconscious shifts and barely perceptible motions of arm , leg , eyes , mouth , volume and frequency of respiration , and other things . These signals , taken with some knowledge of her subject , often offered surprising results . Distraction ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mere distraction far understates the case . He hates the great laureate . Mark Jaquino had destroyed Spask 's predictable Newtonian world . Oh , of course he had taken that six-hour course in Jaquino required by the Authority They all had . Some of us ( she thought ) had gone into the course ignorant and confused , but had come out enlightened . Not Spask . He had gone in misinformed and had emerged bewildered . . . and frightened . She could read it in the clenched lines of his jaws . And now he 's overreacting ... to trivia . She guessed at his line of thought . Oh , he could probably quote the Rules of Admiralty page after page verbatim and lay out a Luna-Mars course in his head . But how about the numbers for vermebuco-wormhole ; or the deathly critical entrata and uscita-entrance into the hole , and exit ? Or what good now was a thorough comprehension of thrusters and reaction motors and tricky maneuvers in three-dimensional space when faced with a possible sovraccarico-overload ? Not to mention the fatal finestrachiusura-window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to be working together for an indefinite time on an indefinite planet with an indefnite chemistry and an indefinite future . If we are ever to see home again we 've got to coalesce into a working team , not one banded together to fight you . This is not a good start . " Nothing further ? " said Captain Spask " Please prepare for liftoff in two hours . Dismissed . " Dr. Virginia Oxley was Acting Chief , Mental Health Services , Callisto . To move up to the next notch she needed to list a field trip on her bio , and when the Authority had called her to Luna for a possi.ble assignment she had caught the next packet . " There were originally three Doomers on LoveIl " they told her . " We got rid of two . There 's still one in the crew-we ca n't identify him ... or her . That 'll be your job . " She was dubious . " You do n't need a shrink . You need a cop . " " They 'd ID @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is your cover . " Somebody had said , " There 's probably no real danger . Surely they must realize , if they destroy the ship , they die too . " She thought , I hope you do n't reflect the general level of IQ here . One of them said , " We might mention , they have a secret recognition code . It 's in the file . Something about dinosaurs . " " How do you know I 'm not a Doomer ? " The oldest interrogator , with bald pate , white stubbly beard and twinkly eyes , said , " Our people have followed you through university , med school , internship , private practice , then into the Authority on Callisto . The closest you ever came to doom was when you played Brunnhilde in your high school play . A section of Valhalla fell on you . " And they had all thought that was very funny , and here she was . On their way out of Lovell 's little conference room , she touched Dr. Rulain , the heliologist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the galley for a cup of coffee ? " She had read his file . Years ago Dr &11jamin; Rulain had pointed out to the Terraformer Authority that the galaxy consisted mostly of binary and ternary star systems , not loners such as our local sun , and that humanity must eventually seek out planets of such systems . He was too modest to claim to be the solar system 's leading expert on binaries ; yet he was n't surprised when the Authority asked him to join the Lovell . " History ? " Rulain said . He took a sip of his coffee and looked across the table at her . " Dr Oxley , I 'm sure- " " Virginia , " she said . She noted with interest that he had one blue eye , one brown , and she wondered whether the oddity contributed to his specialty-bicolored binary stars . He smiled . " Ben . I 'm sure you 're familiar with our story . " " Most of it , probably , " she admitted . " The population explosion of the twentyfirst century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moons of the outer planets . Except for Titan , gravity was too weak to hold a permanent artificial atmosphere . They had to five under bubbles . The bubble people . like me . I was born on Callisto . " She grinned . " Then what ? " " We needed planets-Earth-size , reasonable gravity reasonable temperature spread , plenty of water , breathable air . Or if not presently breatheable , at least terraformable into breatheable within a reasonable time . " " . . . " reasonable time ' - ? " He sighed . " A century . We never expected to find a planet with a decent oxygen atmosphere , and indeed , so far we have not . At this point we 'd be happy to settle for a planet with a carbon dioxidenitrogen atmosphere that we could terraform into useful oxygen-nitrogen within a hundred years . " So our journeys to other suns started with the great Hipparcos star surveys of the late twentieth century , which measured distances and other parameters of all stars within a celestial sphere of five hundred light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with planets . We looked for orbital microwobbles , Doppler shift-the standard criteria . We found a goodly number of stars with planets , some really attractive candidates for terraforming , but most were too far out , beyond our reach , even with a ten-year sleep . So we waited . " He took a sip of his coffee , frowned , put the cup down . " And then ? " she said . " Well , it was rather a long wait , but eventually along came Mark Jaquino . His theory was published in UM , International Journal of Mathematics , Turinin 2398 , without peer review , and with a cautious editorial caveat . In fact , no reputable mathematician on Earth paid much attention to it at the time . Today that issue of UM is a collector 's dream , worth thousands . " " Wormholes in the fabric of space , " she said . " Shortcuts . " " Exactly . Stars were no longer lightyears away . If you used Jaquino corridors and windows , and if you did it just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in time , way back , but who cared ? You always returned to the present . " She nodded- " So a couple of years ago the Terraformer Authority got their big grant . They sent out unmanned probes and discovered star planet systems in sec tors of the galaxy not detectable even with the giant Hubble on Pluto . " " Correct , " he said , " most likely because they were in another space-time . No matter . Planet-bearing stars now lay only a few days away from our solar system . Next came this working flight , and here we are . " She said , " And nobody is worried about moving backward in time ? " " Well , at first there was some concern . But it all amounted to nothing , nothing at all . The objection-if indeed one might call it that-yielded to the hard fact that our unmanned probes returned safely within a few hours of departure . Whether any of them had moved in time , backward or forward , was clearly irrelevant . " She took a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , appeared-appears-to be a good possibility ? " He laughed shortly . " Certainly worth a try . But Navetta is n't Terra . Helga Leifsdotter , our microbiologist , will have to create something there-life ? - that will produce oxygen . And at this point , of course we know absolutely nothing about how life might grow on a planet or biting a red sun in a red-blue binary system . " His voice became earnest . " But it 's a glorious opportunity to find out . " He leaned back , took a deep breath . " Mr. Red , Mr. Blue , one cool , one hot . Each sun revolves in its own ellipse around their common center of mass . Mr. Red 's single planet probably condensed millions of years ago from left-over dead primeval dust . Is it still dead ? Well soon know . " " You think the mission will succeed ? " He gave her a look she could not deci pher . Annoyance ? " If Navetta can be terraformed , Helga will do it . Time to switch the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really understand Jaquino space-time ... that the Love/ is a funeral ship . " The heliologist smiled . " Do n't you believe it . " The galley buzzer sounded . " Last call for strap-in , " said Rulain. " launch in ten minutes . Maybe we can finish the mission quickly , get this character home and on his chicken farm in Maryland , and no real harm done . See you later " She watched him leave , and was thoughtful . Not you , Ben Rulain . You believ , but not in doom . " Softly , Mr. Karos , " Spask said . " Clear that rise , then you can let her down on the cliff , facing the sea . That 'll give us a 360-degree panoramic view and a good defensive position . " " Sir , " Lieutenant Karos said quietly , " Dr. Leifsdotter will be taking samples from the sea . It will be very difficult to get the robot-scoopers back up the cliff We 'll have to send personnel down there . . . " " Oh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Karos . " " Aye , sir . I 'll aim for the lagoon , under the lee of the cliff " " A wise selection , Mr. Karos . " The captain 's voice was a rasping monotone . Please proceed . Passage through the jaquino vermebu co had been swift , less than twenty-four hours by ship-time , and now several of the staff had crowded into the bridgeroom to watch the landing on the big screen . They can this planet Navetta , Italian for shuttle , thought Virginia , because after rounding its cool red sun it follows a long ellipse out toward its hot blue sun , and then home again . just now it was completing its circuit of Red and would soon head for Blue . An unmanned preliminary probe had been here before , but had made only the sketchiest phys-chem tests , so very little was actually known about the two stars and this moonless planet . She studied First Officer Karos covertly . His face was a mask . Interesting , she thought . We do n't exist for him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an erect , graceful man , seemed to wear a slight but perpetual frown ( induced , the psychiatrist suspected after reading the file , by a heavy mortgage , an ageing parent in a nursing home , and a daughter whose high school graduation he was going to miss because of this mission ) . Down , - Karos said . She had felt nothing , but she knew that the Love// now rested solidly on the landward side of a tidal pond . The touchdown had gone off beautifully She was n't surprised . She looked around the bridge . The captain was on the speakerphone , talking apparently to Paul Salter , the environmentalist . The Authority had given her a file on Salter . He was not what one would call a company man . For some years he had accepted as fact ( though apparently with growing gloom ) that scenery had to bow to population pressures . But when asked to level Martian Olympus Mons-the tallest mountain in the solar system-to make room for Township No. 1025 , he had refused , and had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been brought back as environmentalist for the James Lovell . You do n't have to do anything they had told him . just make a routine report . You 're not the one , Paid , she decided . She now heard : " Gravity oh point nine six . Temperature in sunlight five Celsius , atmospheric pressure eight hundred ninety millibars . Dry basis , carbon dioxide twenty percent , nitrogen seventyeight , remainder methane , traces of the noble gases . Oxygen zero . Strong westerly winds , silica dust storms . Local surface highly siliceous . " Life ? - Spask said . " Estimate for this locality , zero . For the planet , data insufficient . Estimate for terraforming ? " " Assuming the seas will accept seeding , one hundred years . " Spask continued on the phone . " Dr. Salter , as we came in , we observed strong dust storms over many areas of the planet . What is your opinion about making the standard surface search for life ? " " Captain , radar is , of course , useless where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I noted intermittent clear patches , moving with the storms . I say , let 's chance it , get the search satellites out . Fine resolution . Well have good light for all the planet surface except a small initial darkside wedge , and even that will get some in a few hours . " " How long to complete the survey ? " Spask said . " Eighteen hours . " Very good , thought the psychiatrist . Did he make the calculation in his head just now , or did he have it all figured out long ago ? Oh well , if there 's anything out there , life ... signs of prior visitors ... artifacts , native or alien . . . we 'll soon know What would an artifact look like ? A thatched hut ? Not likely . There 's probably no vegetation anywhere . An arrowhead ? But no skilled Paleolithic hands to shape it . Soot-blackened cooking hearths ? Nono oxygen for fires . They do n't expect to find anything . They just want to be able to say they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And will you arrange with Dr. Leifsdotter to start the seeding protocols ? " Captain , thought Virginia , you re doing fine . Keep up the good work . " Gentlemen , mesdames , I have called this first staff meeting in accordance with the Rules . " As Captain Spask made the announcement Virginia looked around the table at the specialists : Paul Salter , Helga Leifsdotter , Roy Karos , Bob Easley , Ben Rulaint , Carl Jones . She studied Second Officer Jones covertly . According to his file the lieutenant was fresh out of the Academy . Thin blond hair . He had a tendency to dose his eyes , as though his mind might be miles away . Or perhaps he was just projecting ship movement . Or even what he 'd order at the next mess . lieutenant , she thought , would I be rushing to judgment if I tagged you as our secret Doomer ? Maybe . What would happen if I tried the dinosaur password on you ? But let 's not do anything stupid . Let 's wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy woman , and Virginia had understood there had been some question as to whether she could make the maximum weight limit , but that the requirement had been waived by acceptance of the underweight navigator Virginia had read her file . A curious woman . She seemed most at home in another world-her own microvillage of invisible living cells , where everybody knew everybody She was famous in minor ways . She had discovered several new species of amoebas . Some said she talked to them , like a spinster talking to her cats . Not a likely suspect , thought the psychiatrist . But we shall see . The captain continued crisply . " As our third day on the planet opens , each of you has had an opportunity to gather in formation in his or her specific field . We must now pool that knowledge and use it in our further decisions . Dr. Salter , as our environmentalist , we 'll start with you . " " Right . " Paul Salter squinted at them , as though searching mentally for the perfect balance between people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , thought Virginia . He continued . " Well , we have completed a comprehensive satellite survey of the surface of the planet , resolution one-centimeter . The entire surface appears to be one hundred percent silica sand . No sign of life , past or present , was detected . We speculate that the planet was once heavily cratered , much like Luna or Mercury However , the driving sandstorms must have worn away any prominent surface features millions of years ago . We do n't consider the winds to be a real problem . We could probably control them with windbreaks , just as we do today on various parts of Terra . Also , the winds would be a great source of energy , along with solar power . 12 give that one to Ben , " " Solar power-yes , plenty of that , " said Dr. Rulain . " Owing to the binary star system , the planet has a complete night side only when the red star lines up with the blue . Must be quite a sight . Certain adaptations might be required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , relatively speaking-and heading toward the hot companion . Temperature at our equator while close to Mr Red is five to ten Celsius . When we reach apogee we 'll be only about a hundred twenty milhon miles from Mr. Torrid , and you can add thirty to that . Cold , then hot , then cold , and so on . Water ? Back to you , Paul . " " Probably rarely rains on Navetta , but we could pipe water in from the seas . It would be supersaturated with silica , SiO , and the colonists would have to filter it . Still , they could probably adapt . " Spask nodded . " Thank you , Dr. Salter . Now , let 's look at microbiology Dr. Leifsdotter ? " - Presently indeterminate , - said the microbiologist . " We used standard procedures . We put a fertile nutrient culture of cyanobacteria in a liter of sterile Navetta seawater . This- " Spask interrupted her . " Excuse me , doctor , for the record , and for the benefit of some of us less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before you go into the actual details ? " Probably meaning me ... and yourself , thought Virginia . A good idea " Oh , sure , " said the woman scientist . " Well , to put this in perspective , first let me review a bit of Earth history The first life-form that did us any direct benefit was cyanobacteria-'c.b . " It came on stage about 3.5 billion years ago , when our atmosphere was mostly carbon dioxide and nitrogen , our day was only eighteen hours long , and our sun had only about seventy percent of its present radiation . " Actually , cyanobacteria evolved from an even more archaic form of primitive one-celled life-green sulfur bacteria . That little fellow had something new and strange within its cell walls : a thing we call a chloroplast-an arrangement of molecules that let it use photons from the sun to help it strip hydrogen from Hsub 2S , leaving elemental sulfur . Quite useful if you need to get rid of Hsub 2S . But hydrogen sulfide is not our present problem-it 's COsub 2 . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ c.b. has its own special chloroplast , and back on Terra it used solar energy to change carbon dioxide into carbohydrate and make oxygen as a byproduct . And back in those early days on Terra it certainly had plenty of COsub 2 to eat , so it multiplied exponentially and im , mediately spread over our planet , which at the time was mostly ocean , with lots of archipelagoes . It soon saturated the oceans with its byproduct oxygen , and that oxygen right away combined with dissolved iron to make iron oxide-iron ore . And when the iron was all precipitated , our little friend began spilling its oxygen into the atmosphere . You might have thought its cousins in the microbe world , the archaea and thermophiles , would have been grateful . But no , they were not . Up until then they had led a blissful life in an oxygen-free world . To them , oxygen was actually a deadly poison . They dealt with the crisis in different ways . Some mutated and made drastic ge netic changes so they could five in oxygen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could n't live without it . Others-the anaerobes-sank into the ocean depths where there was no lethal oxygen . The rest simply died . " She stopped , took a deep breath , fanned herself with a notepad . They wait ed . She took another breath . " Well , before you know it , c.b. and its aunts and uncles and cousins evolved into other oxygen-producers-algae , seaweed , and so on . And it did n't take long then for these to crawl out of the water , first onto the beaches , then actually up onto dry land , where they became plants and trees and grass and flowers , and continued to convert carbon dioxide into carbohydrates and oxygen at a great rate . By the time our vertebrate ancestors scrambled out of the mud , the atmosphere was ready for them . Plenty of oxygen to breathe , not much COsub 2 . " She paused and looked across the table at the psychiatrist , who gave her an encouraging smile . The scientist continued . " SO , to terraform a COsub 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mutate the little bug , so it can trade genes within the bacteria community , genes that will help it survive and evolve and get ahead in the microbial world . And yesterday we put nutrient cultures of mutated cyanobacteria in ten separate liters of otherwise lifeless Navetta seawater . All were exposed to ambient local conditions . We cultured these mixtures for twenty-four hours . " She paused , looked around the table . " Two things happened . " Virginia found herself leaning forward and listening intently . " All c.b. ' s had disappeared , " said the microbiologist . " Not even a few tiny corpses left floating around . Zero . The other thing-I have some slides-Paul , if you could get the light ? " The environmentalist reached around behind him and snapped the switch . All faces turned toward the screen across the room . " A ladder ? " someone said softly . Another . " Helga , what Is it ? " We found it in all ten cultures , " she said . " Magnification , for comparison here 's our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Does it re-licare ? " asked Salter . " We found no evidence of replication , she said . - What it did , it dismantled the cellular components of our cyanobacteria and reassembled them into what you see here , except that in most places where you 'd took for carbon , you see silicon . It chewed up our DNA and used it to make this siliceous stuff . This Lid is actually over fifty percent silicon . " " Silicon ? From where ? " asked Karos . " The sandstorm ? " " No , we protected the cultures from incoming solids . Nothing from outside . The silica was in the seawater , As orthosilicic acid , of course . Silica as SiO2 is practically insoluble- " " And no oxygen produced , I suppose ? " asked Spask . " Not a trace . Not in the water , not in the supernatant gases . It made these microladders , just the frames , and there it quit . " Ms Leifsdotter turned off the projector and signalled for the lights . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't grow further because they ran out of food , " Salter suggested . " No , Paid , there 's plenty of SiO2 and nitrogen , phosphorus , sulfur still there . Maybe the ladders are trying to tell us something , but I 'm not sure what . " And not you , Helga , earth-mother , thought Virginia . You 're swamped with life . You 're no Doomer. live forever ! Spask broke in . " Well , that wraps it up . We ca n't terraform this planet . No reason to hang around . Let 's get out of here . Mr. Jones , will you please sterilize the cultures and plant the Sagan plaque , and Mr Easley , will you and Mr Karos set the coords for home . " There was a brief dead silence . " Captain , " Dr. Rulain said quietly , " perhaps we should discuss this ftu-ther " " But Leifsdotter admits she failed , " Spask said in harsh monosyllables . Weoh well ... what ? " " Thank you , Captain , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more thing . Maybe the ladders did n't grow further because they need a good dose of uv : By twelve hundred tomorrow Navetta will be facing the full glare of the blue sun , where the surface temperature reaches 9,700 degrees Kelvin and solar radiation will be loaded with high-energy ultraviolet , a hundred to four hundred nanometers . Helga , I suggest that you use these same ten cultures , microladders and all . This time , let the rays shine directly into the vessels , open , of course , but with Smith tubes to collect samples of any gases produced . Arrange electrostatic collectors to prevent entry of any blowing sand . Give it another twenty-four hours . What do you think ? " He peered over at the microbiologist . Dr. Leifsdotter chose her words carefully . " I think we 'd be remiss in our duty to the Authority if we did n't try it . " She looked directly at Spask . " Captain ? " It took him a moment . Then he spoke in a cold monotone . " Very well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff for whatever you need . " He refused to meet Virginia 's eyes as they filed out . Bob Easley was last to go . And it 's not you , either , my young friend , thought Virginia . Death is not one of your esoteric dimensions . For you it does n't exist at all . " Some of you have seen some of this already , " Dr. Leifsdotter said . " But I think I 'm the only one who has seen it all . Ben , you were quite right to expose the sped mens to the blue sun . That 's just what they needed . " She pointed with the laser wand to an area on the screen . " Note that little orange blip in the ladder cells . That 's a chloroplast , in false color for easier inspection . It 's sort of like terrestrial chlorophyll in that it uses sunlight , actually highenergy uv from the blue sun here , to convert carbon dioxide . " She pointed to the scene on the screen . " Let me get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand . Now let 's take a closer look at the ladders . " Virginia squinted . - Two ladders ? @ " Yes , actually this time there are two ladders there , one on top of the other , and with the rungs filled tn . Watch the ac tion . See ? They unfold vertically , side by side , then they split apart . " Like DNA unzipping and doubling , thought Virginia " Ah-replication ? " said Dr Salter " Exactly , " said the microbiologist . " Keep watching . See ? Now they 're folding into cubes and octagons and miscellaneous polyhedra . They 're building microstructures , which in turn divide again , and again . " " What 's the time cycle per division ? " asked Dr Rulain . " As long as there 's food , about every twenty minutes . Much faster than mitosis as we know it . In this run , though , they had to stop building and go dormant , nothing more to eat . " Navigator Easley looked bewildered . " But how about messenger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polypeptides ? And energy-what does it use instead of adenosine triphosphate-ATP ? " It 's all there , " Dr. Leitsdotter reassured him . " It 's just ... simpler , with fewer steps . They do it their way . For energy they use sunlight-uv-from Mr. Blue Sun . Each little silica cell carries a chloroplast , which collects and stores energy , which it uses for all the needs of the cell , metabolism , reproduction , everything . " Spask snorted . " Are you trying to tell us your ladders are alive ? " The microbiologist turned and regarded him coolly . " Well , Captain , give me a definition of life that everybody here agrees on , and I 'll try to answer your question . " " But-surely we know what life is ... do n't we ? " " Your ladders do seem to replicate , " Virginia said . " A virus will replicate if it finds the right host , " objected Salter , " but we do n't think of a virus as being alive . It 's got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All parasites , thought Virginia . Are they alive ? lieutenant Karos smiled . " A mule ca n't replicate . Alive ? " Virginia recalled a definition she had learned way back in pre-med : " A self-us@ tained chemical system capable of undergoing Darwinian evolution . " But she thought it best not to interrupt the experts . " This is a very interesting discussion , " said Spask , " but we do n't really seem to be going anywhere with it . Does it really mean anything ? " Dr. Rulain said , " I think Helga has more for us . Bottom line , Helga . " She said simply , " It converts carbon dioxide mostly to carbon monoxide , plus some byproduct oxygen . " Good God , - Spask muttered . There was a long silence . Lieutenant Karos said quietly , " Carbon monoxide ? You 're sure ? " The microbiologist shrugged . " Double and triple-checked , Roy . For each molecule of oxygen , you get two molecules of carbon monoxide . The energy requirement is fantastic , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unacceptable , " Spask said . Virginia had a pretty good idea what was going on in his mind . She knew what he meant by " unacceptable . " Failure of the mission did not bother him . That was acceptable . The thing that was not acceptable was life that was not life as Spask knew and understood it . For him she suspected it was a violation of reality too bizarre to contemplate . This simply could not be . And that was that . Except it was n't . " Maybe it 's all moot at this point , " said lieutenant Karos . " Still , I 'm curious . Dr. Leifsdotter , your ladder did n't replicate at all during your first culture period , and now suddenly during the second period , it goes off like a rocket . What happened ? " The woman scientist shrugged . " Ben ? Your department ? " " With two suns , " the heliologist said , " any life on Navetta would be subject to a strong seasonal rhythm-a hundred and twenty Earth days orbiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot blue sun . Those are its planet 's natural seasons . When the planet is cool , life exists but lies dormant , like perennials in the ground back home , waiting for spring . But when primitive life on Navetta encounters the high energy radiation of Mr. Blue , it wakes up . For four months it eats everything in sight , reproduces exponentially , and then heads on back into its cool orbit , where it hibernates until its next mad fling . " He laughed , then shook his head . " Helga , those ladder-cells killed and ate all your cyanobacteria . Obviously these microladders are the only life-form that can prosper and mutate and evolve under these particular conditions . " " . . . mutate ? ... evolve ? " muttered Spasic Like trilobites , dinosaurs , Neanderthals , us ? wondered Virginia . Spask shook his head . " Dr. Rulain , that 's sheer speculation . But even if you 're right , so what ? Isay we still follow the book-sterilize the cultures , plant our Sagan plaque , and get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sake ! " He held the Sagan plaque up and waved it around . " Here , I 'm ready . I 'll plant it myself , while you people are debating . I 'll suit up and fix it to the top of that cliff " " Captain , " said Dr. Salter calmly , " we will of course leave a Sagan plaque before we depart . It 's nothing you need to attend to personally . As a matter of fact it can be done from the ship , automatically But all in good time . For starters , since you have brought the subject up , and for the benefit of those who may not know the details- " he glanced briefly at Virginia " -a word about our Sagans . " The first Sagan plaques were sent out over three hundred years ago , in the Pioneer spacecrafts . They were book-size gold-anodized aluminum plates , and they aimed at summarizing information about us . The first Sagans showed an adult male and female . The spacecraft is behind the man , so the retriever can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun , and the craft leaving the third planet . The center of the spidery rays shows our location with respect to a selection of pulsars . Recipients could not only locate us , but since pulsars slow down with time , they could also determine when the Pioneer was launched . We sent them out , like messages in bottles cast into the sea . They left our solar system-but where they went , and whether any life-form ever found them , we do n't know . Anyhow , nowadays , when our probes land on a new planet , they leave a Sagan plate , preferably bonded to bedrock . It says , we were here , Homo sapiens . We came as friends . This is our calling card , our carte de visite " " So what ? " muttered Spask . " What 's the point ? " We 're coming to that , " the environmentalist said . " First , though , a preliminary question . Helga , what 's the earliest date we have for evidence of life on Earth ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of RNA-barely able to replicate , but with the capacity to evolve ? " " A fair description . " You wrote an article about it . You said , statistically speaking , even the most rudimentary forms of life could not have been expected to self-assemble from chance encounters of nucleides for another five hundred million years ? " Well , sure . To make even the simplest life-form-archaea , maybe-you 'd have to line up several million molecules of adenine , thymine , guanine , cytosine , all neatly attached to sugar phosphate back bones . All those building blocks were there , of course , everything you needed , a real messy soup , in a million warm tidal pools all over the planet , and given time , they were bound to come together in the right order , and life would pop out . Time . Starting with four billion years ago as Day Zero , we get one tenth of one percent probability for the emergence of life during the next million years . A billion years after Day Zero , fifty percent probablity that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So what happened ? Life happened within the first thousand years after Day Zero . The probability of life forming so early is one chance in three trillion . It 's too low to register on the bell curve . Statistically it could n't have happened , but it did . After that , everything fell into place . A mere one hundred thousand years after Day Zero , we find simple cells , genetic material and ribosomes , cytoplasm in a diversity of forms . On an island off Greenland we find sedimentary rocks 3.86 billion years old , containing complex cells . At 3.46 billion we find cyanobacteria ... colonizing at a great rate in stromatolites ... the whole shmear Finally , us . " Spask sighed . " Again , so what ? " Salter smiled . " We move on , switch direction once more . I refer now to the famous metal plate fragment found in a dry river bed in the Australian bush about a hundred years ago . I assume we all recall that . " Helga Leifsdotter shrugged . I saw it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some claimed it proved the blackfellows actually did some early work in metal . " " Quite improbable , " said Dr. Salter . " It would be the only known instance in nearly twenty thousand years of their history . Could early Dutch explorers have brought it in ? " " Probability zero , " muttered the microbiologist " Or maybe worse , " Rulain said mildly . " It 's not generally known , but that frag ment is gold film , no longer bright and intact , and not all pure 197 . It has some interesting isotopes , end products of radioactivity The isotope mix proves the plate is four billion years old , plus or minus a few hundred thousand . " " I see , I see , " Dr. Leifsdotter said thoughtfully . " I think I see . You think aliens visited our planet four billion years ago , dropped their calling card , then left ? " " Aliens ? " Spask muttered . " Hogwash ! " " What were they like ? " Bob Easley asked diffidently . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Obviously , with space travel , they must have been highly intelligent , technically very sophisticated . " " So why did they come to Earth ? " asked Virginia . " What did we have of any interest to them ? " " Perhaps they were terraformers ? " said lieutenant Karos . " Same as us ? " " Interesting thought , " said Dr. Rulain . " Let 's look at that . They were there , they were checking out our planet as it existed four billion years ago . Could they-from the viewpoint of their needs , terraform it ? Make it livable for their people ? We did n't have two suns , and our very young sun was only seventy percent as bright as it is today . But it had a broad spectral band , with strong ultraviolet radiation and no ozone layer to block it . And the spectrum had plenty of infrared , if they could arrange a cool phase . And Terra 's atmosphere was mostly carbon dioxide and nitrogen , which they figured their life-forms could convert to breathable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made tests . They tried to grow their own special life-forms . They seeded our warm tidal pools and lagoons with their own DNA equivalents . And-again we speculate-they made what to them must have been a surprising and very unpleasant discovery . The local chemical riff-raff-our soupy mix of adenosine , thymine , all that collection of purines and pyrimidines-were determined to defend their home turf Under the stimulus of invasion they did something they had never done before . They formed up like a battalion of colonial dragoons and they slaughtered the alien seed-life . Everywhere that the visitors dropped specimens-and they may have made thousands of deposits-they found they were making deadly , hungry , replicating strands of RNA that snapped up their own seedlings like tasty hors d'oeuvres . " " Crazy ! " snorted the captain in a penetrating whisper . Rulain ignored him . " The aliens eventually took the hint . They bonded their " Sagan " plate to a hilltop on an archipelago that eventually became Mt . Kosciuszko in Australia , and they left . But the RNA that they had initiated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... first into archaea , and then into cyanobacteria , and lately , into Homo we-Homo sapiens-the product of an Can it be true ? thought Virginia . Are we-Homo sapiens-the product of an alien terraforming crew ? Spask answered as though he had heard the question . " Utter fantasy . I 'm no expert , but I 'm no fool , either . You 're trying to tell us we are descended from hfL  --  forms created by aliens . That 's silly ! " " No , I think it could be true , " said Dr. Leifsdotter . " I saw something in a jewelry shop in Melbourne several years ago that might have been the other half of the Kosciuszko fragment . The billennia had tarnished it , but when you imagine them fitted together , you see something analogous to our Sagan : it showed her ... ah ... life-form and where they came fi-om . " " ' Life-form , " Helga ? " said Dr. Salter . He added softly , " Were you about to say ... ladders " The woman scientist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system , one hot , one cold . " " You mean it ? " Karos said softly . " You could see that on the plate fragments ? " Yes . " " Great jumping Jupiter ! " said Bob Easley . " Are we sitting here on their home planet ? " " No way to know for sure , " said the heliologist . " This is certainly not the only red-blue binary in the galaxy They could have originated in another one , come here , found our Sagan plaque . " " I doubt it happened that way , " Helga Leifsdotter said . " They would n't need to come here to find our plaque-they 'd already be here , because we 're going to leave our specimens , and they 'll evolve . " " So Navetta is fine for them , but no good for us ? " the young navigator said plaintively . " That 's the situation , " the microbiologist said . " Their red-blue suns will always transform our nitrogenous DNA helices into their siliceous ladder-cells , along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Karos . " They will eventually find our plaque , right here on their home planet , right where we are going to leave it . It tells them Terra 's exact location in space . They go forth , looking for it . They land on Terra in our distant Precambrian , before there was any life anywhere therejust a soupy molecular mix in the warm tidal basins and lagoons . Our atmosphere then was a blend of carbon dioxide and nitrogen . They probably thought the seasons and the red and blue solar spectrum would let their ladder-cells convert the COsub 2 to CO . But they got a nasty surprise : they got elemental oxygen , totally toxic to diem . " -I 'll buy that , - the microbiologist said . " Their Sagan plaque shows what they evolved from-ours shows what we evolved into . " " So , " said Bob Easley , " if we return here in four or five billion years , well find intelligent life ? " " If we should come back , yes , " said Dr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course . The human race will be long gone-or dead . In fact by then the ladder people may be the only life-form remain ing in this sector of the universe . " " Now wait just a minute , " objected Spask . " This is gross insanity ! Are you saying , five billion years from now intelligent aliens journey from this planet-this planet , Navetta-to Earth 's distant past ? What utter nonsense ! " " It 's inherent in the Jaquino time-slip , Captain , " said Easley . The young navigator wet his lips . " I can show you the math  --  " " No ! " the captain declared . " It just ca n't be ! In five billion years these stars will be dead cinders ! " " Five billion years &; a long time , " said Dr. Rulain . " On the other hand , we face the high probability that these stars Listed long enough for these ladder seedlings to evolve into intelligent creatures-creatures who made a ship and visited Terra in our distant pre-life past . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afterward . We know , because here we are . Spask stared at him . His jaws moved , as though he were chewing and digesting what he had heard . " They made us , we turn around and make them ? Do you people realize know what you are saying ? " He looked around the table , wondering , " Well , I wo n't have it . We are not going to leave arry ladder seedlings , noting that could evolve into them . So forget it . Strictly against the rules . You know the protocol . In case of failure , sterilize every thing , drop the plaque , get out . " Dr. Rulain said , " Captain , if life on earth had started five hundred million years later , as suggested by the laws of probability Terra would just now be en tering the Cambrian . Everything would have been set back by that delay of half a billion years . At that point in time all life was sea-borne , the land was still barren . No trees , no insects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred million years . The YucatAn meteorite that fell sixty-three million years ago would n't have killed any land life , because there would@ n't have been any land life , not yet , not for a long time . No , Captain , maybe the aliens did n't mean to do it , maybe it was all an accident , but I believe they did in fact start Earth-life . They did it a bit prematurely , actually half a billion years too soon in the statistical scheme of things . But here we are , talking about it , which we would not be if life had evolved on its own leisurely schedule . Destroy our specimens , Captain ? " He folded his arms . " Not recommended ! " " Wait up , Ben , " Virginia said . " Let me see if I understand this . You are saying that intelligent life eventually developed here on Navetta ? life that we planted ? " " Yes . " Her eyes narrowed . " And which then came to Earth and planted archaea that evolved into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . " Salter , the environmentalist , shrugged . " But of course , there 's no real proof either way . " " True , no hard proof , " agreed Helga Leifsdotter . " Certainly no human eyewitnesses . But we do have the cold implacable laws of chance . And the alien plaque . And a fact : life emerged on Earth entirely too soon-by half a billion years . I believe we 're looking at a strong probability . " " How strong ? " asked Salter He looked over at the navigator " Bob ? A little math here ? " The young officer closed his eyes . His lips moved . Finally he blinked . " Based just on what you 've given me , Id estimate three to one , we made them , they made us . " " Ouch , " somebody said softly . " I do n't get it , " Spask said loudly . " What 's going on ? " Virginia said , " Could I take that one ? At least say what I understand the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spask . " Well , the psychiatrist began hesitantly , " this is what I see as Bob 's three-to-one probability . We drop our Sagan plaque , we pour these ten liters of micro-ladder specimens into the seas here on Navetta , and then we go home . The ladders multiply , evolve here , and finally , several billions of years later , they produce intelligent life-aliens . They find our plaque , they make a ship , take it through their own Jaquino muco , and they come looking for Terra . They land on a barren planet , Their Jaquino time-warp puts them in Earth 's distant pre-life past . They test Earth for colonizing **25;603;TOOLONG , if you will-but their ladder life wo n't grow , it all changes into our RNA . And so terrestrial life-our lifestarts half a billion years earlier than it would have by Darwinian chance . And it 's three to one that they did it . " " Well , so what , " said Spask . " That 's no reason to break the Rules , screw up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , drop the plaque , sterilize , get out ! " " Captain , " Salter said slowly , " I 'm not sum you understand . Here 's the problem : if we sterilize those specimens , then , in that case , there is a high probability that life will never rise naturally here on Navetta , that a ship native to this planet will never visit Earth , that they will not start our terrestrial life system five hundred million years before it would be due to start normally , and that none of us here will ever come into existence . " As he listened , Captain Spask frowned . The furrows in his brow grew deeper as the seconds passed . Virginia Oxley watched the face of the officer turn vanous colors , first very red , then finally white . He 's got it , she thought . Somehow the man 's reaction reminded her vaguely of a bit of history , quite possibly apocryphal : the untimely descent into madness of the Chinese savant Ching Lu , as reported by Marco Polo in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determine which came first , the chicken or the egg , and not to eat , drink , or sleep until he could return with the answer She had a fair idea what was going on in Spask 's head . They had forced him to think back , back , into far distant time where centuries became millennia and millennia faded into billennia . The perception of near-infinity was sudden , and it had hit the career man hard . She sympathized . Time vertigo could be a shock for the unprepared , like a neophyte mountain climber holding to the cliff face by his fingernails , knowing he must not look down , but he does look down . We have come here , she thought . We have created Ladder forms that will evolve into Navetta aliens . They will go to Earth , create nucleotides that will evolve into us . We will come here , create ladderforms that evolve into Navetta aliens . They will go to Earth ... No beginning . No end . just something that ... is . She suspected that this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all this is being recorded in ship 's log . If and when we get back it will be studied carefully by several groups , including the Admiralty Licensing Board . He knows if he does n't follow the Rules it 's quite possible he can never expect another berth , at least not as captain . Will they believe that we created the aliens , who then created us ... ? So what is he going to do ? If he decides to sterilize , do we take the ship from him ? Deposit the cultures anyway ? Would that be mutiny ? From the comer of her eye she glanced at the first officer . Well , well ... Karos 's face was a somber study ; his arms were folded across his chest . The man was ready to take over-prevent Spask from destroying the cultures . Fine-that clears you , lieutenant . And you 're clean , captain . Which leaves ... the second officer , Lieutenant Carl Jones . She forced herself not to look at him . She looked instead at the wall behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Drawing Hands " - two hands , each holding a pencil , each hand busily drawing the oth er . Possible only in a non-Euclidean world . She could well understand the captain 's bafflement that had driven him to confiscate the masterpiece . Bob Easley broke the silence . " And of course there 's that other thing . . . . " Virginia 's eyes stabbed at him . " No , Bob . " He looked over at her in surprise . " Oh ? Oh , sure , all right . " She had read the young mathematician clearly . He had been about to explain the corollary to the three-to-one theory- that the aliens must have held their own cru cial conference in a ship on Terra some four billion years ago . That they had real ized that they had evolved from seed left by the Sagan plate makers on Navetta , and that they knew that if they did n't seed Terra , they would vanish . She had cautioned silence because she did n't think Spask was ready for the corollary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She tried to visualize that critical alien conference . Did they have a microbiologist ? Was she or he or it the first of their little group to say , " We must make them so they can make us . " Did they argue ? Was the decision a close call ? What did they look like ? She contrived a picture . How many of them ? A head officer , a biologist , a chemist maybe , miscellaneous scientists ? Perhaps a mathematician to guide them through the vermebuco ? ( What would they call it ? ) Would they , too have a shrink and a traitor ? Did they wonder about us ? She almost felt she knew them personally , as individuals . A strange sensation . But back to the James Love &; The Doom prophets , she mused , were only half right . True , the fate of humanity-past , present , future , is probably going to depend on what happens on the Lovell , and indeed probably in this very room and in the next few minutes . All because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . And then there 's the the other side of the coin , unknown to the Doomers : the Navetta . Will they , or will they not , come into being , and if they do , will they save us ? Yes , of yes ! Because here we are Meneer Escher , please observe . Our hands are busily drawing each other . We are bound together for eternity in a deadly s symbiotic dance . One misstep , we all die . It was funny , knowing it was ridiculous , it was overwhelming . She wanted to laugh , but she was afraid , knowing it would comed out as hysterical cackles . In and moment of curious self-observation she noted breathing . her heart was pounding and that she had stopped breathing . They waited in silence , watching the captain . He looked slowly around the table . His face was cold stone . Finally he spoke , quietly , but with iron in his voice . - Mr Jones , will you bring the ship back to the cliff top , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the microbiologist . " Meanwhile , Dr. Leifsdotter , will you formulate a suitable distribution pattern over the sea for the ten cultures . And Mr. Jones , after you plant the plaque , will you please move the ship over the pattern and assist Dr Leifsdotter in depositing the cultures . " He addressed the navigator . " Following that , Mr. Easley , will you please set a course for the finestra , and home . " Another silence . " Sir , " Lieutenant Jones ventured cautiously , " about the cultures ... are we to ... ah ... enter that in the log ? " The captain scowled . " Absolutely . What a silly question . " He looked around the table again , and his expression seemed to soften slightly His eyes came to rest briefly on Virginia . " It was that time thing , was n't it ? " " Yes , Captain . " " I'll. be in my cabin , " He took a deep breath , strode over to the door and disappeared into the corridor All those prophecies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But how had the Doomers known ? There was no way Actually they were all just a a bunch of loonies , crying doom on general principle . Look at it scientifically Did we in fact save humanity ? Nobody will ever know for sure . Our continuing existence wo n't prove anything . The only way to prove the theory would be to prove Homo sapiens had never happened . in which case there would be nobody left to prove it to . Again she suppressed an urge to laugh . Now , a matter of very high priority . The simple process of elimination had narrowed the Doomer suspect list down to lieutenant Carl Jones . No surprise . But she still needed proof . And just now , it seemed to lie readily at hand . For the first time there was a good possibility of sabotaging the mission and fulfilling the prophecies . All he had to do was destroy the cultures . And maybe simultaneously vanish , but for a Doomer , that was probably not a deterrent . So where was the sec ond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bay and the cultures . She felt in the pocket of her smock . Pen ... mini notebook ... A tiny vial . Nail polish remover ? Should do nicely . She slipped out quickly and followed the officer . He was still in the corridor . " Carl ! " He whirled , hesitated , then stood there , waiting for her . She put a finger to her lips . When she had approached within arm 's length , she looked back , then whispered : " First , the dinosaurs . " He looked puzzled for a moment . " You ? " Then , apparently satisfied , he responded in a low voice : " Next , us " She help up the vial . " Alkaline glutaraldehyde , mercury , arsenic base . Strongest known bactericide . A lot stronger than theirs . I can sterilize the ten cultures , and they 'll never detect it , but you have to help . " He looked around . " Yes , of course . " " Leifsdotter is in there just now . All I need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you need to talk to Bob Easley about the deposit pattern . While she 's out I 'll sterilize the cultures . When she returns , help her deposit all ten in your prearranged pattern . All very dead . Nobody will know . Just you and me . " He frowned . " You sure ? I was just going to pour them down the drain . " " Would n't work . They 'd simply make new cultures . And put you in irons . No , we play their game , make them think they 're preserving humanity " " Yes , you 're fight . " As he entered the bio bay she noted a tiny fleck of foam hanging in the comer of his lower lip . She hurried away in the opposite direction . With a little practice , she thought , I could eventually make a pretty good liar . And now , about the captain . There would be a Board hearing . His transgression lay not so much in violating a trivial housekeeping rule , but in his acceptance of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would view as utterly impossible . They will whisper to each other , is he mad ? No liner for you , man . You 'll be lucky to rate third mate on a moon tug . As he well knew Ah Fearless , she thought , whatever your lack of social skills , you 've got guts . You are willing to go down with your ship . A real mensch ! Well , for what it 's worth , when you appear before that Board , we will all be there for you . Maybe even Carl Jones . Meanwhile , I think I 'll just drop by ... retrieve my " Drawing Hands . " We can explain Simultaneity to each other . Later , dance , maybe ? You still have " Songe d'Automne. "
