Section : Articles A demoralized army let the plotters down . Will it now support democracy ? <p> WHEN , on the morning of August 19 , the Soviet news agency TASS informed the world of events in the USSR , there were few in the West who predicted the coup would collapse . Three members of the new eight-man Emergency Committee virtually guaranteed the success of the putsch : the heads of the army , Marshal Dmitri Yazov , of the KGB , Vladimir Kryuchkov , and of the Ministry of the Interior , Boris Pugo . They were supported by all three First Deputy Ministers of Defense , Generals Moiseyev ( also Chief of the General Staff ) , Shlyaga ( also Chief of the Military-Political Directorate ) , and Kochetov . They were also backed by some of the more important Deputy Ministers , Generals Varennikov ( Commander of the Ground Forces ) , Achalov ( responsible for reform of the Ministry of Defense and the withdrawal from Eastern Europe ) , Mikhailov ( Chief of Military Intelligence ) , and Kalinin ( Commander of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top KGB officers , Generals Grushko ( First Deputy Chairman of the KGB ) , Titov ( head of the Counterintelligence Directorate ) , Sergeyev ( Chief of the Military Counterintelligence Directorate ) , and Plekhanov ( Chief of the Protection Service Directorate ) . The First Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs , Boris Gromov , who was the last commander of the Soviet contingent in Afghanistan , had publicly criticized the leadership of the country in the past , and his support for the takeover was certain . <p> And yet it failed . The main reason for the collapse of the coup must have been the supreme confidence of its organizers . They did not expect resistance either on the streets or in the armed forces , and evidently made no plans beyond declaring the changes and saturating the capital with troops . Their chain of command was not secure ; they had no contingency plan or back-up units . They allowed Yeltsin to communicate with the world and with the crowds standing in front of Russia 's Supreme Soviet , and permitted Gorbachev 's bodyguards to stay with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their astonishing ineptness . <p> The fact that they were dealing with a population some of whose members were not prepared to be intimidated after a few years of relative freedom was not the most vital factor in their failure . The initial reaction of most of the population was one of apathy , and even two days later the crowd supporting Yeltsin was estimated at fifty thousand people  --  in a city of approximately nine million inhabitants . The main reason for the collapse of the coup was that a significant number of commanders of units ordered onto the streets to suppress the protestors refused to do so . <p> It should not be forgotten that the army had showed much less inhibition in dealing with the Lithuanians and Georgians . And yet this time , the most important commanders failed to obey orders . Commanders of the army 's elite Taman and Kantemir Divisions , the Ministry of Internal Affairs ' Dzerzhinsky Division , and special Alpha units of the KGB refused to attack the crowds . The commander of airborne troops , Lieutenant General Grachev , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had criticized Gorbachev 's leadership publicly , refused to cooperate . The 106th Guards Air Assault Division in Tula and 98th Guards Air Assault Division in Kishinev declined to move after Grachev 's arrest , and the 103rd Guards Air Assault Division , which some time ago was put under the command of the KGB Border Guards Directorate , was put on standby . But it was doubtful whether these troops would shoot at unarmed crowds . In theory Marshal Yazov had at his disposal the Military Intelligence special-forces brigades ( one in every military district ) under the command of Major General Isayev , but their cooperation was far from certain , and General Shaposhnikov  --  commander of the Air Force , which would have had to transport the troops to Moscow  --  refused to support the coup . <p> It still remains unclear why so many commanders failed to support the gang of eight . After all , the Soviet armed forces were one of the main victims of perestroika . The pullout from Eastern Europe and Mongolia had increased the number of NCOs and officers without housing from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers and NCOs are poorly rewarded for their services . A salary of a first-class interceptor pilot with the rank of colonel is 20 per cent lower than that of some of Moscow 's bus drivers . In 1989 , 176,000 students serving in the armed forces were released from military service , which created chaos in many units and deprived them of some of their most intelligent servicemen . Many officers serving in hostile Republics are not allocated accommodation and are the targets of well organized hate campaigns supported by the local authorities . Many combat units have been used as unpaid industrial and agricultural labor to help prop up the staggering economy and bring in the harvest . Not surprisingly , mid-level commanders blamed the shortcomings on inept politicians and the top people in the Ministry of Defense . Furthermore , many officers in airborne forces and other elite units fought in Afghanistan and are bound by the common experience and by a profound distaste for the political leadership . These younger officers may have more say in a restructured Soviet or Russian armed force , as General Shaposhnikov @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 80 per cent of the top military commanders are to be replaced . Cleaning Up the Mess <p> THE NEW Soviet/Russian leaders will have to tackle all the problems that were facing their country before the coup , plus those resulting from it . More than seven decades of suffering and injustice under the Communist government , preceded by turbulent centuries of authoritarian rule , can not be put right without hurting many millions of people who are not to blame for the existing situation and who are both victims of Stalin 's resettlement policies . The problems resulting from the independence of some of the Republics , coupled with the country 's failing economy , will provoke mass migration and result in disturbance and bloodshed . <p> The Republics are impatient to leave the Union . No leader of a Republic demanding true independence will accept a Union treaty which requires ( as the one proposed before the coup did ) central Union control of military policy and state security , the establishment of a single system of conscription and military service , control of the border areas , control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territory of the Republics , and control of defense-industry enterprises . Neither will an independent country accept the stationing of a foreign army on its territory unless it is forced to do so . If the new Soviet/Russian leadership decides to keep the Union together it will not be able to do so by democratic means , although the scale of bloodshed at this stage would probably be relatively small . <p> The independence of most of the Republics would not only create chaos and mass migration , it would also cut Russia off , geographically , from Central Europe and necessitate a complete restructuring of the Soviet/Russian armed forces . The three TVDs ( theaters of military action in time of war ) would probably be abolished , as would many military districts . Movement of large numbers of troops and huge amounts of hardware , and the creation of a new infrastructure at their relocation sites , would take years and cost billions . It would also delay the pullout of Soviet troops from Germany and Poland . The shifting of mobile launchers of nuclear missiles and nuclear-weapon-carrying aircraft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of removing hardened rocket silos to Russia could ruin a stronger economy than that of the Soviet Union . <p> Moreover , the newly created countries would have their own political ambitions . Radical movements in Byelorussia , Lithuania , and especially the Ukraine have already expressed an interest in the territories of some of their neighbors . Moldova is likely to become a part of Rumania despite current denials by both sides , and the Kaliningrad region on the Baltic coast , which is part of the Russian Republic , would be completely cut off from Mother Russia . Most , if not all , of the new countries would wish to create their own armed forces , thus disrupting the uneasy balance in Central and Eastern Europe and necessitating the renegotiation of some international treaties . <p> Having only recently discovered the advantages of a democratic system , mainly for the purpose of gaining power , Yeltsin may decide , with or without Gorbachev 's help , that keeping the Union together  --  Soviet or not  --  is a priority . He would then be the leader of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the armed forces and by the threat of cutting off supplies of raw materials to unruly Republics . If the coup ended in failure , this was only a rare and happy chapter in Russia 's turbulent history . However , the chapter does not end , And they lived happily ever after , ' but rather : To be continued .
