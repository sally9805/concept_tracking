A Nobel Prize-winner 's tale of an orphan and a mysterious sanctuary <p> Menaseh was an orphan . He lived with his uncle Mendel , who was a poor glazier and could n't even manage to feed and clothe his own children . Menaseh had already completed his cheder studies and after the fall holidays was to be apprenticed to a bookbinder . Menaseh had always been a curious child . He had begun to ask questions as soon as he could talk : " How high is the sky ? " " How deep is the earth ? " " What is beyond the edge of the world ? " " Why are people born ? " " Why do they die ? " It was a hot and humid summer day . A golden haze hovered over the village . The sun was as small as a moon and yellow as brass . Dogs loped along with their tales between their legs . Pigeons rested in the middle of the marketplace . Goats sheltered themselves beneath the eaves of the huts , chewing their cuds and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and left the house without eating lunch . He was about twelve , with a longish face , black eyes , sunken cheeks . He wore a torn jacket and was barefoot . His only possession was a tattered storybook which he had read scores of times . It was called Alone in the Wild Forest . The village in which he lived stood in a forest that surrounded it like a sash and was said to stretch as far as Lublin . It was blueberry time and here and there one might also find wild strawberries . Menah made his way through pastures and wheat fields . He was hungry and he tore off a stalk of wheat to chew on the grain . In the meadows , cows were lying down , too hot even to whisk off the flies with their tails . Two horses stood , the head of one near the rump of the other , lost in their horse thoughts . In a field planted in buckwheat the boy was amazed to see a crow perched on the tom hat of a scarecrow . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pine trees stood straight as pillars and on their brownish bark hung golden necklaces , the light of the sun shining through the pine needles : The sounds of cuckoo and woodpecker were heard , and an unssen bird kept repeating the same eerie screech . Menaseh stepped carefully over the moss pillows . He crossed a shallow streamlet that purled joyfully over pebbles and stones . The forest was still , and yet full of voices and echoes . He wandered deeper and deeper into the forest . As a rule , he left stone markers behind , but not today . He was lonely , his head ached and his knees felt weak . " Am I getting sick ? " he thought . " Maybe I 'm going to die . Then I will soon be with Daddy and Mama . " When he came to a blueberry patch , he sat down , picked one berry after another and popped them into his mouth . But they did not satisfy his hunger . Flowers with intoxicating odors grew among the blueberries . Without realizing it , Menaseh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asleep , but in his dream he continued walking . The trees became even taller , the smells stronger , huge birds flew from branch to branch . The sun was setting . The forest grew thinner and he soon came out on a plain with a broad view of the evening sky . Suddenly a castle appeared in the twilight . Menaseh had never seen such a beautiful structure . Its roof was silver and from it rose a crystal tower . Its many tall windows were as high as the building itself . Menaseh went up to one of the windows and looked in . On the wall opposite him , he saw his own portrait hanging . He was dressed in luxurious clothes such as he had never owned . The huge room was empty . " Why is the castle empty ? " he wondered . " And why is my portrait hanging on the wall ? " The boy in the picture seemed to be alive and waiting impatiently for someone to come . Then doors opened where there had been none before , and men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in white satin and the women wore jewels and held holiday prayer books with goldembossed covers . Menaseh gazed in astonishment . He recognized his father , his mother , his grandfathers and grandmothers , and other relatives . He wanted to rush over to them , hug and kiss them , but the window glass stood in the way . He began to cry . His paternal grandfather , Tobias the Scribe , separated himself from the group and came to the window . The old man 's beard was as white as his long coat . He looked both ancient and young . " Why are you crying ? " he asked . Despite the glass that separated them , Menaseh heard him clearly . " Are you my grandfather Tobias ? " " Yes , my child . I am your grandfather " " Who does this castle belong to ? " " To all of us " " To me too ? " " Of course , to the whole family " " Grandpa , let me in , " Menaseh called . " I want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him lovingly and said : " One day you will live with us here , but that time has not yet come . " " How long do I have to wait ? " " That is a secret . It will not be for many , many years " " Grandpa , I do n't want to wait so long . I 'm hungry and thirsty and tired . Please let me in . I miss my father and mother and you and Grandma . I do n't want to be an orphan " " My dear child . We know everything . We think about you and we love you . We are all waiting for the time when we will be together , but you must be patient . You have a long journey to take before you come here to stay " " Please , just let me in for a few minutes " Grandfather Tobias left the window and took counsel with other members of the family . When he returned , he said : " You may come in , but only for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and let you see some of our treasures , but then you must leave " A door opened and Menaseh stepped inside . He was no sooner over the threshold than his hunger and weariness left him . He embraced his parents and they kissed and hugged him . But they did n't utter a word . He felt strangely light . He floated along and his family floated with him . His grandfather opened door after door and each time Menaseh 's astonishment grew . One room was filled with racks of boy 's clothing-pants , jackets , shirts , coats . Menaseh realized that these were the clothes he had worn as far back as he could remember . He also recognized his shoes , socks , caps , and nightshirts . A second door opened and he saw all the toys he had ever owned : the tin soldiers his father had bought him ; the jumping clown his mother had brought back from the fair at Lublin ; the whistles and harmonicas ; the teddy bear Grandfather had given him one Purim and the wooden horse that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The notebooks in which he had practiced writing , his pencils and Bible lay on a table . The Bible was open at the title page , with its familiar engraving of Moses holding the holy tablets and Aaron in his priestly robes , both framed by a border of six-winged angels . He noticed his name in the space allowed for it . Menaseh could hardly overcome his wonder when a third door opened . This room was filled with soap bubbles . They did not burst as soap bubbles do , but floated serenely about , reflecting all the colors of the rainbow . Some of them mirrored castles , gardens , rivers , windmills , and many other sights . Menaseh knew that these were the bubbles he used to blow from his favorite bubble pipe . Now they seemed to have a life of their own . A fourth door opened . Menaseh entered a room with no one in it , yet it was full of the sounds of happy talk , song , and laughter . Menaseh heard his own voice and the songs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his parents . He also heard the voices of his former playmates , some of whom he had long since forgotten . Photograph <p> The fifth door led to a large hall . It was filled with the characters in the stories his parents had told him at bedtime and with the heroes and heroines of Alone in the Wild Forest . They were all there : David the Warrior and the Ethiopian princess , whom David saved from captivity ; the highwayman Bandurek , who robbed the rich and fed the poor ; Velikan the giant , who had one eye in the center of his forehead and who carried a fir tree as a staff in his right hand and a snake in his left ; the midget Pitzeles , whose beard dragged on the ground and who was jester to the fearsome King Merodach ; and the twoheaded wizard Malkizedek , who , by witchcraft , spirited innocent girls into the desert of Sodom and Gomorrah . Menaseh barely had time to take them all in when a sixth door opened . Here everything was changing constantly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Events flashed by . A golden horse became a blue butterfly ; a rose as bright as the sun became a goblet out of which flew fiery grasshoppers , purple fauns , and silver bats . On a glittering throne with seven steps leading up to it sat King Solomon , who somehow resembled Menaseh . He wore a crown and at his feet knelt the Queen of Sheba . A peacock spread his tail and addressed King Solomon in Hebrew . The priestly Levites played their lyres . Giants waved their swords in the air and slaves riding lions served goblets of wine and trays filled with pomegranates . For a moment Menaseh did not understand what it all meant . Then he realized that he was seeing his dreams . Behind the seventh door , Menaseh glimpsed men and women , animals , and many things that were completely strange to him . The images were not as vivid as they had been in the other rooms . The figures were transparent and surrounded by mist . On the threshold there stood a girl Menaseh 's own age . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see her clearly , he liked her at once . For the first time he turned to his grandfather . " What is all this ? " he asked . And his grandfather replied : " These are the people and events of your future " " Where am I ? " Menaseh asked . " You are in a castle that has many names . We like to call it the place where nothing is lost . There are many wonders here , but now it is time for you to leave " Menaseh wanted to remain in this strange place forever , together with his parents and grandparents . He looked questioningly at his grandfather , who shook his head . Menaseh 's parents seemed to want him both to remain and to leave as quickly as possible . They still did not speak , but signaled to him , and Menaseh understood that he was in grave danger . This must be a forbidden place . His parents silently bade him farewell and his face became wet and hot from their kisses . At that moment everything disappeared-the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Menaseh shivered and awoke . It was night in the forest . Dew was falling . High above the crowns of the pine tree the full moon shone and the stars twinkled . Menaseh looked into the face of a girl who was bending over him . She was barefoot and wore a patched skirt ; her long braided hair shone golden in the moonlight . She was shaking him and saying : " Get up , get up . It is late and you ca n't remain here in the forest " Menaseh sat up . " Who are you ? " " I was looking for berries and I found you here . I 've been trying to wake you " " What is your name ? " " Channeleh . We moved into the village last week . " She looked familiar , but he could not remember meeting her before . Suddenly he knew . She was the girl he had seen in the seventh room , before he woke up . " You lay there like dead . I was frightened when I saw you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and your lips were moving " " Yes , I did have a dream " " What about ? " " A castle " " What kind of castle ? " Menaseh did not reply and the girl did not repeat her question . She stretched out her hand to him and helped him get up . Together they started toward home . The moon had never seemed so light or the stars so close . They walked with their shadows behind them . Myriads of crickets chirped . Frogs croaked with human voices . Menaseh knew that his uncle would be angry at him for coming home late . His aunt would scold him for leaving without his lunch . But these things no longer mattered . In his dream he had visited a mysterious world . He had found a friend . Channeleh and he had already decided to go berry picking the next day . Among the undergrowth and wild mushrooms , little people in red jackets , gold caps , and green boots emerged . They danced in a circle and sang a song which is heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in time is ever lost .

Why does Singer make a point of sharing this detail ? 2 What details in the real world foreshadow those in the dream world ? What is the relationship between the two worlds ? Sidebar Isaac Bashevis Singer Sidebar In 1978 , at the age of 74 , Isaac Bashevis Singer received the Nobel Prize in Literature . In his acceptance speech , Singer noted , " People are asking me often , why do you write in a dead language ? And I want to explain in a few words ... I like to write ghost stories , Sidebar and nothing fits a ghost better than a dying language . The deader the language , the more alive the ghost . Ghosts love Yiddish ; they all speak it " Like most of the Jews of Eastern Europe and Russia , Singer grew up speaking Yiddish , a language that mixes elements of Russian and German , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeply expressive language , with a rich literary culture . Traditional Yiddish stories were often moral tales , built upon stories from the Bible , but set in the struggling villages of Eastern Europe . But as the European Jews suffered the horrors of the 20th century-including the Holocaust-Yiddish began to disappear . As the most influential writer of Yiddish literature in the 20th century , Isaac Bashevis Singer mav not have saved the language , but he helped to Sidebar ensure that the sensibility of Yiddish traditions would endure . The youngest of three children , Singer was born on July 14 , 1904 , in the Polish town of Rad , min , near Warsaw . His family was very poor ; growing up , Singer played with broken dishes and branches instead of toys . Singer 's parents Sidebar were deeply religious . The only literature Isaac and his two siblings were allowed to read was the Torah , the first five books of the Bible . All other forms of reading material were considered trefnot kosher or suitable for Jews . Though Singer 's parents shared a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Singer 's mother was a pragmatist , who valued the intellect over the emotions . By contrast , Singer 's father believed in the power of emotion , especially in religious worship . But Singer 's mother was also a great storyteller , who told the young Isaac hairraising tales of ghosts and goblins , devils and imps . Singer became fascinated with making up stories ; even before he knew how to write , he covered sheets of paper with make-believe words . Singer 's father wanted his son to be a Sidebar rabbi , but Singer yearned to write . Finally , in 1923 , after years of religious study , Singer left the seminary to become a proofreader , and eventually a translator , for a literary magazine . Then , in 1934 , he published his first story , " Satan in Gora ? " The following year he moved to the United States and started a job with the most prestigious Yiddish newspaper of its day-the Jewish Daily Forward . As a mature writer , Singer brought the distinctive qualities of Yiddish literature to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be characterized as magical-realist-it always starts in the real world , but often departs for the miraculous . For example , in " Menaseh 's Dream , " the orphan Menaseh is an authentic child , one Singer might have encountered in a real Polish village . Menaseh lives with his uncle , " a poor glazier , " and is to be apprenticed to a bookbinder . This is not the realm of miracles , or is it ? In the forest , Menaseh enters a magical domain . Though we 're told that what follows is a dream , the boundary between reality and dream state has been erased . That boundaryor meeting ground-between the real world and one of magic and imagination is Singer 's favorite terrain . Sidebar Throughout his career , Singer published more than 20 books , including novels and collections of short stories , in Yiddish . Most of his works have been translated into nearly every existing modern language .
