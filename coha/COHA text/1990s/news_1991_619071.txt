<p> In the months after losing an arm to bone cancer , 7-year-old Danielle Roundtree somehow learned to tie her shoelaces by herself . Her mother , Alicia , tried to imagine how she did that with only five fingers . Picture the mother sneaking into the daughter 's room to satisfy her curiosity . <p> " I did peek in once when she did n't know I was there , but she kind of had her back to me so I still do n't know exactly how she does it . But however she does it , she did n't need any help . " <p> When Danielle , who is now 10 , is asked to explain her method , a fierce pride wells up within her . She said softly but assertively , " I ca n't tell , Mom . I just ca n't . I ca n't tell Daddy , or you , or anybody . " <p> Alicia Roundtree stared at her daughter and shook her head , amazed at her resilience , which has taught the whole family lesson after lesson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a miniature version of her mother , all legs and energy . Her father , John , manager of a florist shop 's rose department , and brother , Javel , 14 , are more of the same . <p> " People call us the Trees , and the kids are the branches , " said Alicia . <p> Two months after the amputation of Danielle 's left arm and shoulder in 1988 , she had had enough of lying around at home and hopped back on her bike . <p> " I could n't watch at first , " her mother said . " The doctors told us she might have trouble balancing , or that it would take time for her to learn how to ride again . " <p> Danielle did n't miss a beat , riding off happily , the wind in her face . Days before , she had tossed aside the pretty hats her mother had bought her to hide the hair that was still short and brittle after chemotherapy . <p> " I was so impressed that she did n't feel she needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Danielle can accept this thing , so can I. Little by little , she was moving back to being just a kid again . " <p> Danielle , a sixth-grader at Steffan Manor Elementary in Vallejo , studies yucky fractions and the Greek and Roman empires . She talks too much in class , is one of those kids who always raises her hand and likes reading and writing . A total tomboy , she hits the playground at recess like an athlete finally sent in from the bench . <p> " All the stories Danielle writes for me in class are about basketball players , " said her teacher , Pam Ehlers . <p> She and the boys head straight for the hoops . Her best friend , Eric DeWolf , 12 , said she 's fun to play with , and so what if she 's a girl ? <p> " I like her ' cause she 's honest and stuff , and she 's a pretty good player . " <p> Danielle usually takes her shots as far back as possible . <p> " The kids are always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it , ' " she said . " But when I do , they all say , ' Lucky shot . ' Sometimes it 's lucky , but , well . . . I know how to play . " <p> " She 's an amazing basketball player , " Ehlers said . " She 's accurate , she maneuvers that ball really well , dribbles , moves around , takes the ball away . " <p> The only time Danielle became self-conscious about her arm , Ehlers remembered , was at the beginning of the school year when the kids brought in their baby pictures to show each other . " Danielle brought in a picture of her and her brother ; of course , she had both her arms in the picture . That was the only time I saw her uncomfortable . " <p> ' I JUST DO IT ' <p> Last year , when Danielle decided to try out for the Police Athletic League softball team , she and Javel spent hours in the back yard devising a one-armed method of hitting and fielding . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched how they moved and stuff . I do n't know how I do it exactly , I just do it , " she said . <p> Her coach , Ron Morales , said Danielle 's batting stance looks something like this : " She 's got a style where she lays the bat on her shoulders . When the ball comes to her , she braces herself and moves her feet at the same time she swings the bat . It 's all one motion . Once she makes contact with the ball , she 's like a little rabbit running to first base . She 's good . Her batting average is up there with the rest of the girls . " <p> Danielle 's fielding technique may be time-consuming , but it works . <p> " She catches the ball in the glove , drops the ball , throws off the glove , picks up the ball and throws it , " Morales said . <p> Unfortunately , she feels stuck out in left field . <p> " I hate it out there , " Danielle complains . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it does it either goes over my head or I miss it . " <p> Morales remembers his first meeting with her . <p> " There were about 20 girls left at the end of the draft pick , and no one really wanted to pick her up . But I know something about playing with a handicap , " said the coach , who had polio and wears a leg brace . " The first time we talked about it , she said , ' Oh , polio , huh ? ' I told her , ' You ca n't let something like that hold you back . ' " <p> She has n't . By now , the worst of times has passed  --  the day in July 1988 when John and Alicia Roundtree first heard the diagnosis , osteogenic sarcoma , the same kind of cancer that claimed the leg of Edward Kennedy Jr . In Danielle 's case , the tumor was in her upper arm , nearly as big as a fist and growing . <p> " The remarkable thing about this little girl was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor , Arthur Ablin , professor of clinical pediatrics and chief of pediatric clinical oncology at the University of California at San Francisco . " No matter what occurred , she had the ability to face it openly , and her family was very open about discussing things with her . She never made grandstand plays . Whenever she did cry , it was completely appropriate . " <p> Two months of chemotherapy followed , but the tumor refused to shrink . Soon there was no choice but to amputate the arm and shoulder blade , in an operation similar to the one former Giants pitcher Dave Dravecky underwent last spring . <p> BREAKING THE NEWS <p> Alicia Roundtree had found the strength to handle the doctors and second opinions , the endless tests and the awful diagnosis , but she could not tell her then-7-year-old daughter they would have to take her arm . <p> " My husband told her , " Alicia said , wiping away sudden tears . <p> " It was n't hard at all , " John Roundtree remembered . " We are all very straightforward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next to her in the hospital and I told her , ' If I was your kid and you were the parent , would you want me to have two arms and die or have one arm and live ? ' She said , ' I 'd let you live . ' I said , ' Well , that 's what I 'm going to do with you . ' " <p> Some equally distressing nights came after the surgery , when Danielle would wake up screaming , with phantom limb pain . <p> " She 'd cry and say , ' It 's still there , Mom , it 's still there , I can feel it , ' " Alicia remembered . " It was so strange . That probably lasted for six months , on and off . " <p> Alicia held her daughter through that night and many others . <p> In the three years since , Danielle has been in top shape , although she was n't able to escape the flu that was going around this month . Dressed in a pink flannel nightgown and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other day , settled into the couch with the remote control , clicking furiously until she found a rap music video show . She moved to the beat , a tissue to her nose . But she would rather watch sports , everything from wrestling ( " It 's fun to watch their muscles " ) right down to bowling . <p> Her mother waits on her , but only until the cold is better . <p> " I do n't believe in coddling her . She vacuums , helps with the laundry , picks up her room , the same chores we all have . She does n't do them happily , but she has to do them , " Alicia said . <p> " We 're going into year four with no recurrence , " she said , jumping out of her chair to let out a whoop . She glances at her daughter , leaning against the couch , one sleeve of the pink flannel nightgown hanging limp . <p> " I miss her arm , " Alicia said softly , " but I keep thinking of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget the arm . She 's alive . She 's doing fine . Danielle has helped me learn this . "
