<p> Furs are making news again , and they owe their rediscovery to a renewed interest in fashion . <p> As shoppers return to malls , lured by the conservative chic of ' 60s- and ' 70s-inspired fashions and on a quest for quality and luxury goods , furs are finding a niche in the market again . Do n't expect , however , to see many furs resembling your mother 's mink coat . <p> And it would be a mistake to say that fur is back . While its image has been tarnished and the ranks of furriers decimated , the truth is that fur never left . It did go underground - or in some cases , did n't leave the cold storage vaults for several years - during which time the fur customer , and hence the fur industry , experienced drastic changes . <p> " " You sell a coat here and there , " said Houston furrier Richard Peters . " " It 's not like it was . " " " Compared to the fur business 10 years ago , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's close , " said Jerry Gronauer of Sakowitz Furs . <p> The career-woman client , a light of hope for furriers 10 years ago , has not evaporated , but her tastes and spending levels have changed . <p> Furrier Sam Spritzer said not many career women are buying for themselves . " " Usually if a woman comes in to pick out a fur , her husband calls back later with a credit-card number . " <p> Gronauer estimates that 15 percent of the 2,000 or so furs he sell each year are bought by career women buying for themselves . <p> Now , many career women have families and are spending less on their personal wardrobes , or they prefer fur-lined all-weather coats for travel or fur-trimmed garments for greater versatility . <p> Furs also got smaller as fashion silhouettes grew slimmer , raincoats took on fur linings , and apres-ski furs are so unbelievably colored today that few people suspect they are natural skins . Zuki , for example , designed a red-dyed sheared beaver pullover and Arnold Scaasi , a green Mongolian lamb jacket . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furs with Mickey Mouse motifs . <p> In Houston , women still bring out their furs when the temperature falls below 50 degrees , and many women and men still rate fur as the ultimate fantasy gift . Last Christmas Eve , Gronauer was wrapping boxes himself until 7:30 because he stayed open late and sold five sables to a man for his wife and daughters . <p> " " Men definitely buy furs at the last minute as impulse gifts , " he said . <p> Olga Garcia , store director of Fendi , said men still dream of giving furs , and it 's an impulsive dream . Each Fendi fur purchaser receives complimentary gift wrap , delivery and a bottle of champagne . <p> Fur gifts this holiday season range from $ 150,000 Russian Barguzin sable coats to mink Teddy Bears and mink key chains ; in between there are lynx blankets , girls ' sheared rabbit parkas , chinchilla boleros , mink bikinis , fur-trimmed leather gloves , fur headbands and ponytail holders , broadtail tuxedo pantsuits , Mongolian lamb hats , earmuffs , mufflers , bouquets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancer awareness campaign . <p> Mink coats are there , for sure , but most of the furs being sold this season are novelty items . <p> At Houston 's Esther Wolf , for example , owner Fred McCann said he 's doing a brisk business in boxy , four-pocket , white or dark brown mink jackets that reverse to cashmere , like sweaters , and sell for $ 1,995 . <p> " " We have full-length minks , too , but people have gone crazy on prices . They 're ridiculous . All our minks are from the ( United ) States ; they 're the best quality , but most people are n't spending that kind of money . " <p> Esther Wolf also sells an all-weather Giorgio Sant'Angelo full-length trench coat in dark green , burgundy and black microfiber with fox trim for $ 699 , and Giorgio Sant'Angelo shiny evening or daytime coats in black , brown , red or royal blue satin with black sheared beaver trim ( $ 599 for the 3/4-length or $ 699 for full-length ) . Or McCann recommends a mink-lined denim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mink coat is still the best seller at Sakowitz Furs . " " It 's always been the No. 1 best seller , and it always will be . " <p> He also sells a lot of fox and lynx , but recommends as a bargain a Mary McFadden golden sable priced at $ 20,000 . But these are classic furs , and today Gronauer is selling more " " fun " furs - lots of fur and leather , reversibles , fox or mink trims , leather lined with sheared furs for less bulk and apres-ski furs . <p> At Sakowitz , a fur-lined raincoat that reverses to cotton poplin , microfiber or leather ranges from $ 1,500 to $ 7,000 . <p> " " The designers usually have the more desirable garments today , " said Gronauer . He buys heavily from McFadden , Nina Ricci , Givenchy , Louis Feraud , the new Zandra Rhodes collection and Zuki , whose sheared beavers are worked in bright colors with intarsia designs . <p> " " We 've been doing well with cashmere capes with fox trimmings , black , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Peters . <p> " " Plus , I 'm also doing well with these very lightweight crocheted beaver jackets in 3/4 lengths . " The jackets are priced at $ 2,295-$ 3,595 . <p> Even though he sold a sable coat two weeks ago , furrier Samuel Spritzer said his business is mostly mink . <p> " " The long hair sells but not as in the olden days . Now fun furs sell a lot , mink and leather reversible , leather trimmed and lined , and it surprises me , but lots of microfiber . " <p> It used to be that mink coats sold for $ 8,000-$ 15,000 . " " Now it 's $ 2,200-$ 3,000 , " said Spritzer , for good quality U.S. minks . <p> " " People are looking for a reasonable price , " he said , " " but they want quality AND a better price . " <p> Spritzer sells a Pierre Balmain coyote coat for $ 2,900 and a mink and leather bomber jacket for $ 1,200-$ 1,500 , many of the latter to visiting Mexican customers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sheared mink in purple , red , black or green . <p> At the Fendi boutique in the Galleria , Garcia sees the emphasis on mink , chinchilla and cashmere shawls with fur trim . And while Fendi designer Karl Lagerfeld combined real and fake furs some years ago , he is now sticking to natural fur , she said . <p> At the Revillion Fur Salon in Saks Fifth Avenue , the best-selling coats are fur-lined raincoats and a full-length mink swing coat at $ 4,995 . But all kinds of fun furs in wild , bright colors are selling well , as are cashmere garments with fur trim and earth-tone 7/8-length coats with fur trim . <p> " " A few people are coming in for luxury furs , " said Lisa Aaronson , Saks fashion director - furs such as Russian Barguzin sable coats and full-length chinchillas . At Neiman Marcus , faux fur sales are as brisk as those of natural furs . A 3/4-length swing coat in leopard print is hot , as are items with faux fur collars and cuffs , said spokesperson Lynda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full-length furs are popular , as well as luxe furs ( sable and lynx ) and novelties , such as reversible Persian lamb and dyed and sheared furs . <p> Most U.S. furriers are selling U.S. furs well for good reason , said Spritzer . " " Most of these furs are bred , as opposed to long-haired furs from elsewhere around the world that are becoming so expensive . " <p> The Chinese are using long hairs to trim coats for their own population , while the Koreans are purchasing their own furs , making them up in Korea and shipping them to countries that want low-priced goods , said Spritzer . <p> A suddenly cash-rich group of Russians , in a country that traditionally shipped many of its long-haired furs abroad , is now going in with cash - " " no letters of credit , no checks and payment in advance " - to buy Russian furs for themselves , their wives and girlfriends . <p> There is little doubt that changes in the economy and society - more modest spending practices , social consciousness , conservation and global @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , the number of fur-district workers in New York has fallen from 25,000 in 1955 to 2,000 in 1995 , according to the Fur Information Council of America . <p> In Houston , Peters estimates that since 1976 the number of furriers ( those who sell only furs ) has declined from about 20 to only three , and one of those , Spritzer , is advertising a Going Out of Business sale , planning to retire sometime after Jan. 1 <p> There are fewer department and speciality stores today , and fewer of them carry furs . One that does declined to be included in a story about fur , which remains a sensitive subject . <p> Celebrities and models continue to choose sides in the animal-rights advocates ' campaign against wearing fur . On the side of those who do are Ivana Trump , Sophia Loren , Catherine Deneuve , and designers Karl Lagerfeld , Marc Jacobs , Rodney Telford , Yves Saint Laurent , Zandra Rhodes , Mary McFadden and Arnold Scaasi , and a lot of women too frightened of paint- and insult-hurling activists to admit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing real fur are Mary Tyler Moore , Bea Arthur , Kim Basinger , Alec Baldwin , Melissa Etheridge , talk show host Ricki Lake ( who managed to get herself arrested in an invasion of Lagerfeld 's Fifth Avenue offices ) , and designers Betsey Johnson , Carolina Herrera , Oleg Cassini , Todd Oldham and Giorgio Armani . The list of supermodels who refuse to wear fur includes Nadja Auermann , Naomi Campbell , Cindy Crawford , Kate Moss , Claudia Schiffer and Christy Turlington . <p> This fall , during the 7th on Sixth spring collection in New York , People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals took to the sidewalk in front of Bryant Park with a 25-foot inflated beaver . That the black beaver looked so much like a rat that most members of the press mistook the demonstration for a high-profile rat eradication program was little comfort to the PETA people .
