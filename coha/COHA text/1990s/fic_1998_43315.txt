A cautionary tale for those who assume the easy way is the best way .. <p> The grid was a tray containing 1,089 small glass cups , 33 on a side . Each cup contained soil and a fingernailsize plastic chip . The chip was stuck halfway into the soil substrate . Dr. Jain surveyed the assembly with melancholy disinterest . He had prepared the grid one week ago , using soil taken from the local county landfill . Which is to say , the dump . A variety of chemicals had been added to some of the cups . The untreated containers served as controls . Dr. Jain was thinking mixed thoughts . His foremost thought was his forthcoming session with Dr. Nyrock , Chief of Organics , and his immediate supervisor . He was fairly certain Nyrock was about to fire him . Lesser thoughts involved his current project , an attempt to biodegrade plastic scrap . We produce millions of tons of the stuff ( he was thinking ) . It 's against the law to burn it . It does n't degrade in land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more of it , and it accumulates , builds up , just keeps growing . Only a fraction is recycled . We 're converting all our gas and oil and air into junk that must eventually smother us . Wheat , chickens , cows , tomatoes , we eat , and they disappear . Not plastics . We bury iron , and it dissolves like sugar . Wood , paper , cellulose quickly carbonize in the ground . Raw vegetation turns to compost practically overnight . Plastics just sit there . He sighed . The project must fail . As he had known it would . Project BDbiodegradation . After one week , not one of the more than a thousand chips had degraded . If the run proved anything ( he thought ) , it proved that all plastics are inert under all conditions . No surprise , really . Ny rock probably had assigned the project to him because it was sure to fail . And probably his swan song . Rather idly he picked the translucent polypropylene chip from a corner cup , examined it briefly , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come in the morning and remove all the chips and weigh them . She would find no differences in weight , appearance , anything , and that would be the end of the run , the end of the project , and the end of him . He looked up at the wall clock . Four P.M. He was due in Nyrock 's office in thirty minutes . He jerked . Had he taken his insulin shot ? No . Small wonder Chaotic schedule . Everything out of sync . He went over to the lab refrigerator , got his insulin vial , rolled it between his palms to stir up the colloids . If he were fired , he 'd have to remember to pack it in ice , take it along with the books and desk detritus . Synthetic insulin . A beautiful piece of genetic engineering . They implanted the human insulin gene in a bacterium , and the little microorganism faithfully did the rest . It had lived because it was useful . He was useful , and he was dead . He should have been born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ syringe . He removed the sterile cap , fumbled , accidentally hit a vein in his arm , and was about to withdraw the needle and try a centimeter away , when he stopped , because he realized he was having a very remarkable idea . Enzymes . . ? He drew out a cc of blood and emptied it into the corner cup in the grid . He tossed the syringe into the sharps can , checked the wall clock . He could n't stay around and watch , but he 'd be back . At the door he turned for a last look at his desk . A stranger would probably be sitting there before the week was out : some smart savvy high-tech brand new young doc at half the salary and no pension worries . Downsizing. . . done in by downsizing . Time now to report to the chopping block . Bad form to keep the executioner waiting . He closed his eyes briefly and started down the corridor . " Don , " Dr. Nyrock said matter-of-factly , " I 'll give it to straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 've been with us a long time , and your severance package will be generous . " " What if I do n't want to take early retirement ? " Nyrock shrugged . " You know the answer to that . You 'll be terminated for cause . " " On the day before my pension vests . " " If it comes to that . " " For cause . " What cause , Rocky ? " " Cause ? " The group leader thought for a moment , then he got up , came around the desk , and stuck his forefinger in the chemist 's chest . " You 've always wanted my job , Donald . And a couple of times maybe you came close . You 've certainly had a string of successes . But now management tells me I 've got to terminate one senior chemist . So I pick you , Donald . That enough cause for you ? " No answer . Nyrock snorted , returned to his chair . " Look . . . I do n't care whether you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't , we save money , maybe increase my Christmas bonus . Suit yourself . " He pushed the packet and a ball-point toward the destroyed man . " Sign at the X. Keep a copy . " Dr. Jain hesitated five seconds , clenched his fingers couple of times to stop the trembling , then signed . " Good . Now , Donald , we 'd like for you to clean out your desk promptly , turn in your records , keys , that sort of thing . Be out by noon tomorrow . " Dr. Jain gathered up his severance package . He understood the thinking . In a way it was humane . Clear out the corpses quickly . . . they 're a mental hazard to the survivors . He said softly , al have a run going in the hood . Can I wind it up ? " " Whatever . . . just be out by noon tomorrow . " On his way back to the lab , he was thinking . Well , he could n't complain that he had been surprised . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were ironclad , like the rules for writing a sonnet or for dancing the minuet . Nyrock had merely done as he was told . He had followed the rules , step by step , except maybe for that last part where he had become insulting . No need for that . He realized that downsizing had nothing to do with the economic health of the corporation . In fact , the healthier the company , the more likely it would get downsized . It was the fashion . And that 's the way it had happened here . First the tobacco consortium , majority shareholder , had elected Paul ( Stogie ) Stokeley as CEO , and then Stokeley had brought in the hatchets . Bright young men came in big shiny black limos like the stretch broughams leading a funeral procession . They examined the rosters . They looked at ages and salaries . They picked Group A-senior high-salaried employees on the verge of pension-vesting . He , Donald Jain , was a statistic in Group A. Then Group B-several younger people , pretty much at random , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , case by case , but quickly-the terminations . Theoretically , tremendous amounts of money were saved . Productivity and sales might dip a little at first , but were predicted to recover soon . Dr. Jain opened the door and walked into the lab . How did he feel ? He felt-odd . There was some sort of paradox at work here . He had left the bay in fear short of breath , heart racing . Those present had watched him go , a zombie , the condemned man walking down that last mile . But returning . . he felt somehow relieved . The bad part was over . Now to wind up and get out of here . It was the tail-end of the work day . Everybody had gone . His mouth twisted in a half-smile . They did n't want to stay and view the cadaver . They had even turned off the lights . A bit premature , are n't we , fellows ? He snapped the lights back on and rather briskly walked over to the hood . He studied the polypropylene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It looked different . Well , well . . . he flicked away the grains of soil , washed the chip in distilled water , dried it in blotting paper , and took it to the scale . Simple matter to check it against starting weight in the log . Yes . It had lost weight-eight milligrams . Wow ! Far too much for experimental error . He got his heartbeat under control , then sat down on a lab stool to consider this . It was the blood , of course . Almost certainly an enzyme in the plasma . As hoped for , but still a bit of a surprise . He 'd identify the little beast later . Well , maybe not he . . . but somebody would . On the other hand , why should he care ? He did n't , not really , except it was his run , and he knew something very important had happened , and that he , Don Jain , had brought it about . Query , what does polypropylene degrade to ? Let 's find out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lab mixer , followed by the blooded contents of Cup 1,089 . He watched the little spheres pick up the stain . He emptied the treated beads into a glass column and set it up in the hood . Overhead he fixed a timed water drip . Under the column he placed a beaker to catch any liquid that came through . Next to this he arranged an identical setup , except that the beads were untreated . He snapped Polaroids for his lab notebook and brought up the closed circuit TV camera . And , he thought , I will feel very silly if this does n't work . But here goes . He looked up at the wall clock . Approaching nine PM . Save for the watchman making his rounds , he was totally alone . Fine with him . He turned the water drips on , both at three cc per hour . Before the hour was out things began to happen . Under both columns something was dripping into the collection beakers . He sniffed , then tasted the liquid in the control beaker . Plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ column . Another sniff , another taste . Golly ! Pinacol ? Highly characteristic odor . Yes . Normally a crystalline solid , but evidently dissolved here in a liquid mix of its cousins and uncles and aunts . Mostly dihydric alcohols ? Reasonable . Enzyme splits the polymer chain into three , six , nine-carbon segments . Three gives propane diol , six gives pinacol , nine gives nonane diol . And maybe even higher mono and di-alkanols , normally solids , but maybe dissolved here like pinacol . These were exothermic oxidation products . In effect , he was burning the polymer , and he was probably generating heat . Should he cool the column ? He felt the glass . It was warm . Have to watch that . Determine optimum operating temperature . Determine a lot of things . Not me , but somebody . His blood . An enzyme , obviously . Find it . That 's all that 's needed . All the rest . . . plasma . . . cells . . . waste products . . superfluous . A real can of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Project saved . Job saved ? Job ? What job ? And who cares ? Donald Jain lifted his eyes to heaven . Thank you , thank you . The fates were finally with him . Did he dare look ahead ? ACS chemist of the year ? The savior of one hundred thousand landfills all over the world ? And that 's just for starters . Next , sieve out the plastic scrap , let the Jain process convert it all to useful oxygenated carbon compounds . Big money ! Yeah , but money for whom ? He frowned . Got to give this a lot of thought . He looked about the bay . It was dark , empty , silent . Like a temple , he thought . There were tiny noises . . . residues of sounds left over from the day . Perhaps a few barely audible vibrations from the distant highway . But by and large-silence . It was all his . Back to the hood . Next ? Polystyrene . . coffee cups . . . molded shipping shapes . . . the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another blood draw , he filled a third column with blood-treated polystyrene " popcorn " . Within the hour he was rewarded . Drops of sparkling liquid began falling into the collection beaker . He could smell it from where he sat , and he grinned happily . Benzaldehyde . He did the equations in his head . The polymer depolymerized , giving the original styrene molecule-vinyl benzenewhich then , under the insistence of his enzyme , oxidized smoothly to benzaldehyde . A beautiful smell , like almond oil . Still another column ? Well , why not ? Acrylates . Already preoxygenated , should be a snap . And now about some of the nitrogens ? Polyamides . . . polyurethanes. . . nylons . Might get a little byproduct HCN . Better turn on the hood fan . By seven A.M. he had five columns up and running , besides the control , and his multi-punctured arm was beginning to ache . Time to sit down and complete his notes . And finish cleaning out his desk . The lab had kindly given him a couple of corrugated boxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first , the record . He was still writing in his lab notebook when the first technician came in at eight-thirty . She seemed surprised to see him , but shrugged and headed for the coffee stand . The fun began a little after nine , when the professionals began arriving . They all reacted pretty much the same . First , they took note that Jain was there . They nodded , mumbled something , did n't meet his eyes . Secondly , after they put together their coffee or tea or cola , they noted the hood was open and the fan going . They sauntered over , read the labels in front of the glass columns , and then ultimately and reluctantly approached ( not too close ! ) the leper . " Don-what the hell ? Is it real ? " " It 's real . " At ten Dr. Nyrock came down . He inspected the columns . He talked to the chemists clustered at the hood . Heads kept turning back covertly to look at Jain . Sometimes he caught an eye and grinned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . yes , here came Nyrock . He had some kind of genial expression on his face . Not a smile , exactly , and anyhow he could n't hold it , and his face was back to normal by the time he reached Jain 's desk . " Is it real ? " he blurted . " The plastics oxidize to alcohols . . . Aldehydes ? " Yes . " " Reproducible ? " " Yes . " " Well . . . Donald . . . I do n't really know what to say . " " You do n't need to say anything , Rocky . I followed the procedure . I wrote it up in detail . " He handed the group leader his lab notebook . " You can witness and date the page yourself . Also , you 'll have the Polaroid and video records . I guess that wraps it up ? I 'm due out of here by twelve , guess I 'd better be on my way . " He picked up the box of books . " But ... " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were meeting in the second floor conference room , where the oak table was just the right size for five people . Axel Kursh , Vice-President , Research- " Veep-R " , had come down from the seventh floor . " Gentlemen , madam , " he said softly , " Marketing International tells me this BD invention may be worth several billions , worldwide , over the life of the patents . If you can make it work . Rocky , bring us up to date . " Dr. Nyrock took a deep breath . He knew he had but followed instructions in terminating Jain . He also knew it might well appear the act was poorly timed . Stupid , even . But how was he to know ? " Rocky ? " whispered Veep-R . " Yes . Well , a week ago Dr. Jain completed certain experiments demonstrating biodegradability of several types of plastics-polyolefins , styrene , acrylates , and so on . He used his own blood as a catalyst . In five columns of five different plastic chips , tap water plus the catalyst reacted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oxygenated products ranging from glycol to benzaldehyde . Dr. Jain provided a full written record in his lab notebook , and in addition we have photographs plus excellent TV coverage . So far as we can determine , he held nothing back . " " But you ca n't reproduce his results , " Kursh said in a flat , non-accusing voice . " That 's true . So far , anyway . There 's a difference , somewhere . We just do n't know what it is . " " In the blood ? " " Maybe . First we tried cow blood from the slaughterhouse . No luck . Then human blood . Jain is Type A , so we tried that first . Then O , the universal donor type . No . He 's a diabetic , so we tried various levels of insulin , with and without glucose . Nothing . " The group leader studied Kursh 's face uneasily . " We now think it may be something specific , something quite rare . Something possibly found only in Jain 's blood . Our bio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of blood . We have tried sixteen or seventeen , with several very rare types still to come in from Africa and Asia . " He shrugged . " Dr. Rothkull is our consulting hematologist . Perhaps he can explain the problem a little better . " " Doctor ? " said the vice-president . The hematologist , a florid rotund man , frowned thoughtfully . " Well , Axe , I think we have to realize that blood is an organ , like our liver , or kidneys , or lungs . And it 's like a highway , with all kinds of traffic . Blood plasma is ninety percent water , but it 's loaded down with all kinds of goodies : glucose , lipids , vitamins , hormones , proteins , enzymes , metabolites , wastes . The major protein is albumin , which is there in sufficient concentration to prevent loss of water to surrounding cells . And of course it carries lots of red blood cells-billions per cc . And white blood cells , too-one or two per thousand RBC . And an array of dissolved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where life arose : sodium , chloride , bicarbonate , calcium , magnesium , copper , potassium , zinc , a few others . " He paused and looked around the table . " So , with all these variables , it 's easy to see that everybody 's blood differs slightly from everybody else 's . Sort of like fingerprints , or DNA . " Kursh coughed softly and looked across the table at Nyrock . " Doctor , " the organics chief said hurriedly , " where does it all come out ? What 's the bottom line ? " " Tentative bottom line , " corrected Rothkull genially . " We suspect Jain 's blood contains an oxidative enzyme that is not present in any of the blood samples so far tested . " The vice-president looked thoughtful . " But how could Jain 's blood be so different ? " " Different physiological history , " said the blood expert . " Different childhood illnesses , with different immune response residues . " " Maybe I 'm missing something here , " observed Jones , of Marketing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood ? It contained this miraculous enzyme . What happened to the enzyme ? Did it get used up ? " " Not in the sense you mean , " said Rothkull . " The problem is half-life . Most enzymes just finally fade away . " " Doctor , " whispered Kursh , " if you had a sample of Jain 's blood , could you identify this hypothetical enzyme ? " " Probably . We 'll need at least five cc . Get him in here . Let the nurse draw the sample . " The vice-president continued . aAnd Rocky , if we I.D . it , can you make it commercially ? " " Probably , but first we 'll have to see what it is . " " Of course . Now then , Jain 's under contract to assist us in patenting his inventions made in the course of employment and for a year thereafter , right , Rocky ? " " Yes . We all are . " Axel Kursh smiled faintly . " Anything unreasonable in asking him to donate five cc of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M. Justin , Budget Forecasts , spoke in a low drawl . " We fire him on Monday , Tuesday we demand his blood ? " The leader chuckled . " Right on , Maxie . He 'll tell us to go to hell . Still- " " How high can we go ? " asked Ms Justin . " I need the figure for the next quarter " " A million , " said Veep-R . " Rocky , you have his number , you place the call . Start low . " He pushed his cell phone across the table . The organics chief hid his distress nobly . " Now ? " " Now . We 'll listen in on the speaker . " The call went through promptly , almost as though the ex-employee had been waiting for it . " Hello , Don ? Rocky here . How are you ? " " Nyrock ? Well , well . You calling from the conference room ? " The caller sighed . " Yes , Don . We 're all here , listening . " " Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried all sorts of ways to reproduce your runs , Don . Nothing works . " " That 's what I hear . " " There 's something special in your blood , Don . We need a few cc , just enough for a microanalysis . All you have to do is come in , let the nurse draw a sample . " " No . " " You have a legal obligation , Don . " " So sue me . " From the corner of his eye Nyrock noticed that Kursh was shaking his head . " We 'll pay , Don . " " How much ? " " Ten thousand . " It was really a question . Dr. Jain 's laugh would have been a pleasant thing to hear under other circumstances . " How much are you thinking about ? " Nyrock said hoarsely . " Well , let 's see . You 've got a potential market up in the billions . Would a hundred million be reasonable ? " " Donald ! " The word was really a squeak . Nyrock turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Your turn , said Jain . Kursh whispered two words . " One million , , Nyrock said . He added diffidently , " Subject to successful testing . " " No , a million on delivery . " " Our place ? " " Your dispensary . Tomorrow , nine A.M. Check by EFT , my bank , the instant I walk in . " As the meeting broke up , the vicepresident asked Dr. Nyrock to return with him to his office on the seventh floor . " But Axe , " protested Nyrock , " When I fired him , I just followed orders ! Your orders . . . From behind his desk Axel Kursh nodded sympathetically . " I know , Rocky , I know . But I think you must agree , your timing was abominable . Another week , Rocky , maybe even another day , and we 'd have that blood for nothing . But a million , Rocky ? Stogie Stokeley is going to demand a body . Sorry , Rocky , it 's me or you . Be out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down from New York . " Even using a million dollars worth of Jain 's own blood , it still did n't work ? Why ? " He took the cigar from his mouth for a moment and aimed a blast of smoke across the conference table in the general direction of the No Smoking sign on the opposite wall . Axel Kursh coughed delicately . " We do n't know , Mr. Stokely . " " Call me Stogie , Stogie said . " Perhaps something in the way the blood was drawn ? " " Ms. Bailey ? " Kursh said . The nurse sniffed , put a handkerchief to her mouth . " Standard procedure . Dr. Jain came in at nine o'clock . I personally drew the blood . Exactly the same procedure as a thousand times in the past . Thump the arm , find a good vein , swab it , stick the needle in , draw it up . In this case , six cc , discharge it into the ten cc anti-coagulant blood tube , stopper the tube , send it down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Perhaps we added something ? " Dr. Rothkull said . " Sir ? " Ms. Bailey 's query hung between indignation and surprise . " EDTA , " said the hematologist . " Ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid , sodium salt . Standard practice to add a 15% solution as a preservative ? " " Well , of course . In fact , it 's already in the vials , before the blood is even drawn . Sir . " Rothkull sighed . " Let 's think about that . Normally a blood clot forms from the polymerization of protein fibers circulating in the blood . A variety of proteins is involved in the mechanism , and blood wo n't clot if they do n't work together properly . That 's why EDTA is a fine anticoagulant for blood . It pulls one or more of the clotting proteins out of the loop . The mechanism is a bit fuzzy , but we think it chelates some of the metal-carrying oxidoreductor enzymes , probably including one or more of the low molecular-weight redox metallo-enzymes essential to the Jain process . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another sample , this time no EDTA , rush it right in to analytical . " All eyes turned to Axel Kursh . His voice was lifeless . " He will want more money . " There was a short silence . Then Stokeley began waving his cigar like a cudgel . " What am I hearing ? We already gave the rogue a million . You mean he will want more ? I do n't believe this ! Whatever happened to company loyalty ? " He clenched his teeth furiously and looked around the table . " Well see . And will somebody find me an ashtray . Axe , get him on the line . I 'll talk to him . " The call went through promptly . " A million , Donald ? But we gale you a million . Another million ? Have you no sense of ethics ? Do you realize what you 've done to this company ? On account of you we 've had to retain people in analytic . . . microbiology. . . marketing assessment . . . sales . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 've had to rehire people , expand several departments , all just to deal with your crazy process . You 've completely wrecked our downsizing program . And now you want more ? Oh , shame , Donald ! Are you totally devoid of honor ? We 're the laughing stock of The Wall Street Journal , Forbes , Fortune , the whole financial world . You name it . " He paused , panting . They listened to Jain 's calm voice on the speaker . " You misunderstand , Stogie . What I have in mind now for the company is a million dollar , package deal , something that could prove very useful , not only to the company but to you personally . The second million gets you blood plus full rights to my new invention . " " No , Donald . Look , all we want is a little blood . We do n't need your new invention . I 'm sure it 's really terrific , but we just do n't want it . It 's just the blood . Okay ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the blood . That 's the most I can approve without going to the Board . " He hurried on . " You have to appreciate my situation here , Donald . " He lowered his voice . " I 'm walking a tightrope . Any more funny business , any more negative PR , the Board votes me out . The next CEO might turn you down altogether . It 's you and me , Donald . " They listened to the voice on the speaker . " I understand the difficulty , Stogie . I would n't think of embarrassing you . Good-bye . " " Wait ! " But there was only a dial tone . Stokely stubbed his cigar in the waiting ashtray . Someone carried it out of the room . " Get him back , Axe , " the CEO said grimly . The eyes of the vice-president and chief executive officer locked briefly , and Kursh read doom in the exchange . He thought of his two sons in college , a heavy mortgage , expensive car , expensive wife , and wondered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ package . The connection was fast . " We can deal , Donald , " Stokeley said bitterly . " A million . Same as before ? " " Sure , Stogie . " " Oh , incidentally , what 's your new invention ? " " Glad you asked . It 's an extract from a fungus growing over my septic tank . It 's all in the descriptions . You get the entire package , Stogie-patents , know-how , everything , all part of the package , along with the blood . The consortium will sit up and take notice ! I 'll call a press conference , invite the local papers , Time Magazine , USA Today , 60 Minutes . You 're invited , of course . Check to my bank by EFT ? " " It 's on the way , Donald . Not that it matters , but what exactly does this extract do ? " " It 's a sure cure for nicotine addiction . Hope to see you there , Stogie ! "           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
