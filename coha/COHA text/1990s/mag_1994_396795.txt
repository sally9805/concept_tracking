THE SYMBOLISM in the drawing at left is traditional : The dragons are contending for a pearl , an Oriental emblem of great riches . What 's modern is the identity of the players . In the struggle to create and capture wealth in the East Asian side of the Pacific Rim , the role of the smaller dragon these days is being played by Japan . The big dragon is an entity that holds no seat at the U.N . but is emerging as the economic power to reckon with in the region , Greater China  --  the 1.3 billion citizens of the People 's Republic , plus those dazzling entrepreneurs , the 55 million Overseas Chinese . As these charts reveal , the three small nations where the Overseas Chinese predominate  --  Hong Kong , Singapore , and Taiwan  --  have by themselves eclipsed Japan as the primary source of capital and foreign investment for the region with the world 's fastest-growing economy. chart omitted Toss in the assets controlled by Chinese businessmen in counties where they are a minority , such as Indonesia ( 3% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this ethnic group 's clout grows even larger . The Overseas Chinese are conservatively estimated to control some $2 trillion in liquid assets . If these enterprising souls lived in one country , its gross national product would tally at least $500 billion  --  larger than the $410 billion GDP of mainland China . Now combine the People 's Republic exports and imports with those of Hong Kong and Taiwan , and Greater China already accounts for a larger share of world trade than those arch-exporters , the Japanese ( see chart ) . That edge can only grow . Drawn by China 's capable pool of low-cost labor and its growing potential as a market that contains one-fifth of the world 's population , foreign investors continue to pour money into the PRC . Some 80% of that capital comes from the Overseas Chinese , refugees from poverty , disorder , and communism , who in one of the era 's more piquant ironies are now Beijing 's favorite financiers and models for modernization . Even the Japanese often rely on the Overseas Chinese to grease their way into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giant trading company Itochu , says that his long-term association with an influential Indonesian Chinese , Oei Hong Leong , has led to a joint venture for brewing Asahai beer in the PRC . Partially as a result of this , China 's economy , which advanced at a torrid 13.4% clip last year , has become a potent tonic for the entire Pacific Rim . Says economist Lawrence B. Krause in a report issued by the Pacific Economic Cooperative Council , an organization of government officials , business people , and academics : " Even Australia and the United States find China the fastest-growing market of any size ... With Europe still mired in recession and Japanese imports either stagnant or declining , dependence on China for growth of export markets is unlikely to be reduced very soon . " None of this means , of course , that it 's time to treat Japan as an also-ran . After several tough years , that economic colossus seems to be coming back , and with a new mindset . Its giant companies are far and away the region 's technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electronics and automobiles . But having long provided the model and much of the capital for other Asian countries to develop export-driven economies , Japan will likely see its role diminish somewhat in the years ahead . Says Robert Lloyd George , a British investment banker in Hong Kong and author of The East-West Pendulum : " Now it is the Overseas Chinese states of Southeast Asia which are taking up the baton . My contention is that the leadership of Asia , in economic and cultural terms , will pass to the Chinese during the next 20 years . " However that struggle plays out , here 's the good news for international business : Propelled by both the older Japanese dynamo and the newer Chinese engine , East Asia 's economies will continue expanding considerably faster than the 2%-to 3%-a-year global average . Switching analogies , Kenneth Courtis , senior economist for Deutsche Bank Capital Markets in Tokyo , suggests thinking of Chinese and Japanese capitalists as the economic equivalent of oil and vinegar . Says he : " They do n't really mix , but they complement each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lubricant that makes deals possible  --  and the Japanese are the vinegar  --  the technology , capital , and management that really packs a punch . " That potent combination should ensure that this area of some two billion people stretching from Japan and South Korea through China and southward to Indonesia , Malaysia , and Thailand  --  keeps getting richer quicker than any other region at any time in history . South Korea 's GDP alone has grown as much in a single generation as America 's did in the last century . Outside Japan some 75 million Asian households will have incomes roughly equal to those of middle-class Americans by the year 2000 . No wonder this swatch of Asia is the most promising market for aircraft , cars , construction equipment , and much else . The U.S. , for instance , exports more goods to Singapore than to Italy , and more to Malaysia than to the entire former Soviet Union . Exciting , big-ticket opportunities gleam behind the boring word infrastructure . Over the next six years , Asian countries plan to invest more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants , and airports . In one of the three stories that follow in this special report , we explore the rewards  --  and potential risks  --  this building boom holds for Western investors and contractors . Two other articles take you deep inside the private world of those dynamic capitalists , the Overseas Chinese , and detail Japan 's latest efforts to awaken to new economic realities . BEFORE WE MOVE ON from China , however , it 's essential to add a few words of caution . While that country 's great leap away from communism toward the market has started with a tremendous boom and its long-run potential looks promising , the short-to medium-term hazards are large . Right now , in fact , the PRC is reeling from the side effects of breathless expansion . Its double-digit growth rates are bumping into the limits of a primitive transportation system , inadequate electric power , and such basic environmental constraints as shortages of clean water . Inflation , raging at over 20% annually , hit 27% in major cities in August . Free-market reforms on the farms have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peasants who are streaming into cities in search of jobs . Mobs of those migrants can be seen camped at every municipal railway station . And according to the bureaucrats in Beijing , a get-rich-quick fever among Chinese has created widespread corruption that could derail their modernization drive . Well aware of the chaos , the PRC 's leaders hope to curb inflation by reducing the country 's economic growth rate to 11% this year and perhaps to only 9% to 10% next year . What makes a soft landing difficult to pull off is that the country remains awkwardly poised between fading Marxism and would-be capitalism . As economist Krause puts it , " The old planning system has not been fully dismantled , and the market system has not yet matured . " Thus , while Beijing can slam on the monetary brakes , they are only loosely connected to the real economy . For one thing , decision-making has shifted heavily from the capital to local officials , who are in no mood to curb entrepreneurial activities on their turf . The obvious solution is for China to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proving devilishly complicated . Says Sanjoy Chowdhury , chief regional economist for Merrill Lynch in Singapore : " Much of Beijing 's legitimacy now comes from its ability to deliver economic gains . With the collapse of communism and the demystification of Mao , economic development has become the prime justification for communist rule . " The biggest drag on China 's economy and drain on Beijing 's resources is the huge pack of state corporations that are industrial dinosaurs . About half of them  --  some 50,000 enterprises  --  are losing money , and their total debt is estimated at nearly $70 billion . True , several profitable state enterprises , such as Shanghai Petrochemical , have gone public in both Hong Kong and the U.S. But rather than close down the clunkers , the government keeps lending them money , which fans inflation and prevents meaningful reforms of the financial system . Chinese leaders talk about letting the losers go bankrupt or cutting off their access to scarce raw materials . But there 's no sign of action . The senior citizens in charge  --  the average age of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of causing mass unemployment . In the meantime , some enterprising Overseas Chinese are doing what they can to ensure that the PRC becomes a more hospitable place for international investors . Perhaps the most ambitious is Lee Kuan Yew , the senior leader in Singapore . At home Lee has created a model for what Beijing admires but has yet to replicate : a well-ordered , prosperous nation led by an incorruptible regime that maintains firm political control . China 's supreme leader , Deng Xiaoping , in fact , has urged his countrymen to learn from Singapore . A WILLING TEACHER , Lee now hopes to further China 's evolution toward free enterprise  --  and in the process provide profitable opportunities for his countrymen  --  by building what 's essentially a miniature version of Singapore in Suzhou , about 50 miles west of Shanghai . The Singapore government will provide the management expertise for what is officially called the Singapore-Suzhou Township , while 19 Singapore companies will help build it on a 27-square-mile site . So far , Singapore has signed up 14 companies from the U.S. , Japan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nearly $900 million in Suzhou factories . Despite the extraordinary backing Beijing is giving this deal , Lee 's biggest challenge will be assuring those investors that the town will be run with efficiency and honesty , qualities that are rare elsewhere in the People 's Republic . To close the gap , 300 Chinese officials will be trained in Singapore , which will station about 100 of its own administrators in Suzhou to coach them . Says one Singapore official : " If multinational corporations feel comfortable investing in Singapore , they should feel comfortable in Suzhou . " In general , however , even China 's most enthusiastic foreign backers acknowledge the dangers that lie ahead . Says William Purves , chairman of HSBC Holdings , the London-based company that controls Hong-kong &; Shanghai Banking Corp . in Hong Kong : " Fundamental problems are still largely being evaded , and this will limit good investment opportunities for some time . " Until those clouds clear , the most active investors in China will remain the Overseas Chinese , particularly those based in Hong Kong , who invest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a form of political insurance . When control of Hong Kong , now a British colony , shifts to Beijing in less than three years , will that capitalist enclave still be allowed to operate unfettered ? The communists have said yes , but Hong Kongers figure the best way to ensure that outcome  --  and protect their immobile assets , such as real estate  --  is to continue helping the PRC get rich too . To improve their odds of making money , though , the Overseas Chinese usually steer clear of joint ventures with state corporations , focusing instead on setting up small factories and developing real estate . In coming years , the other source of capital sure to reshape Asia 's economic landscape is Japanese direct investment . To cope with a strong yen , Japan 's corporate giants have no choice but to accelerate the migration of their most labor-intensive manufacturing to Asian lands with lower wages and cheaper land . True , that expected surge of money from Tokyo has not been much in evidence yet . Japanese investment in the rest of Asia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended in March . But rest assured it will come , even if pressure on the yen abates somewhat . The reason : Back home , Japan is graying fast . It already boasts the world 's highest average life expectancy , over 76 years for men and 85.5 years for women . That great accomplishment in human terms is also a guaranteed economic burden . By the year 2020 , more than 20% of Japanese will be over 65 years old . Taking care of this venerable flock will consume an equivalent one-fifth of the country 's GDP . To support the elderly , Japan 's capital must inevitably flow to fast-growing countries that boast an oversupply of young , energetic workers . Happily , the Pac Rim offers an abundance of such choices . Though it 's the least likely site for Japanese investment , the country that has most closely emulated Tokyo 's example of nurturing corporations with government assistance is Korea . This year its economy is soaring along with a growth rate of nearly 8% . Success , however , means that Korea is no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and assembling consumer electronics are being taken over by the Likes of China and Indonesia . Yet in technological know-how , Korea still lags well behind Japan and the U.S. To say prosperous , Korea is teaming up with the latest flock of Asian states rising like geese along the development route mapped by Japan . Example : A group of Korean manufacturers led by the conglomerate Samsung is working with a PRC aircraft manufacturer to develop a new 100-passenger jetliner for the Asian market . Likewise , Korea 's automakers are tripling their production capacity to six million vehicles annually  --  much of which will be assembled in Indonesia and other Asian countries . Among the region 's still industrializing economies , the pacesetters flourish mainly in industries handed down from Japan , Korea , the U.S. , and Europe . Malaysia , for instance , has become the world 's largest exporter of semiconductors by welcoming the leading foreign makers of those chips and providing them with a dependable work force . Thailand and Indonesia , too , are outposts for international manufacturers of Barbie dolls , clothing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is showing signs of dynamism and renewed political stability . Its economy , which stalled for the past several years , should expand about 4% this year . Daewoo and Hyundai of Korea are going there to assemble autos . Hitachi plans to make small disk drives for computers , and Federal Express has set up an Asian cargo hub . As President Fidel Ramos puts it , " We 're back in business at the heart of Asia . " How do the Asians do it ? In a recent study of what it called " The East Asian Miracle , " the World Bank turned up no magic formula , no single set of government policies . The key , its experts concluded , is culture : " People in these economies have simply studied harder , worked harder , and saved more than people in other countries . " That prevailing attitude , buttressed by the wealth-creating rivalry between Japan and Greater China , guarantees that for the foreseeable future Asia will remain the most dynamic force in the global economy . <p>      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
