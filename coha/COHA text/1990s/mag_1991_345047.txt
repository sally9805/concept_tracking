Now 75 , he was a pharmacist mate at the Naval Hospital . <P> I saw a gray plane with a large red dot on the fuselage fly past , and a corpsman shouted , " The Japs are bombing us ! " A bomb hit the destroyer Shaw in dry dock , and the concussion broke windowpanes in the hospital and blew our clothes and hair as if we were in a tornado . <P> At about dusk we saw four planes flying low , coming up the channel toward the harbor . Almost every antiaircraft gun in the Navy Yard started firing at them . The sad part is , they turned out to be U.S. Navy planes from the carrier Enterprise . Three were shot down , and the fourth pilot was brought into the hospital , wounded . <P> We had a bed capacity of about 300 people . At midnight that night we had 960 patients . And we had 313 dead , stacked outside like cordwood.                 @ @ @ @
