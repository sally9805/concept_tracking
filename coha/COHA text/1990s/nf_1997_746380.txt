The practice of having certified physical education teachers also be certified to teach health is not uncommon ( English &; Duke , 1995 ) . In many school districts , budget constraints require that one person fills both roles . Unique to Montana , and just three other states , is that only one teacher certification is offered for the two disciplines of physical education and health education ( Bennett &; Peel , 1994 ) . Further , not only does Montana certify its teachers in both curricular areas , but it has mandated that the two curricular areas be combined into one course for each of the grades kindergarten through 12 ( Office of Public Instruction , 1989 ) . Teachers in physical education , therefore , are required to integrate classroom health education and physical education into a single course . <p> In 1989 , the State of Montana instructed individual school districts to combine learner outcomes for health and physical education under the umbrella term " Health Enhancement " ( Office of Public Instruction , 1989 ) . The Health Enhancement curriculum was based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are designed to assist students in becoming healthy , productive , and responsible adults ... and both meet the same goals , why not combine and enhance the efforts of each ? " ( Office of Public Instruction , 1989 , p. 5 ) . The Montana Health and Physical Education Committee suggested that combining health and physical education is a unique approach grounded in the theory of " curriculum infusion " and advocated that neither the traditional health educator nor the traditional physical educator can best " give students the tools to make sensible and responsible health choices for themselves and their communities " ( Office of Public Instruction , 1989 , p. 5 ) . The division of time between the two content areas was left to the discretion of individual schools , but a plan of curriculum development reflective of program standards and learner outcomes was to have been instituted by 1991 ( Office of Public Instruction , 1989 ) . <p> Current literature in physical education and health education does not support an optimism for sharing goals and methodologies of these two distinct disciplines . In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1994 ) , health education was not mentioned . Equally , physical education was not mentioned in a review of current certification practices of health educators including K-12 preparation ( Luebke &; Bohnenblust , 1994 ) . In one study , only 16% of the health educators surveyed were also duel certified as physical educators ( Lovato &; Rybar , 1995 ) . <p> Misunderstandings about the role of health , health education , and physical education persist . Since the release of Healthy People 2000 ( U.S. Public Health Service , 1991 ) , physical education curriculum planners have moved toward a health-fitness emphasis in choosing activities for physical education classes ( McGinnis , Kanner , &; DeGraw , 1991 ; Morris , 1991 ; Sallis &; McKenzie , 1991 ) . Yet " healthful physical education " ( Seidenwurm &; Phillipp , 1986 ) , which encourages a healthy active life-style , is quite different from the tenets of classroom health instruction advocated in health education literature ( Allensworth , 1994 ; Hill &; Fischer , 1992 ; Lovato &; Rybar , 1995 ; Luebke &; Bohnenblust , 1994 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abuse , teen pregnancy , HIV/AIDS prevention , eating disorders , death , suicide , and a host of other issues far removed from the limited focus of a " healthful physical education " curriculum . A review of course work from selected universities of required classes to earn a degree in each of these disciplines reveals distinctly different curricula ( e.g. , University of Southern Illinois-Carbondale for health education , and University of North Carolina-Greensboro for physical education , amongst others ) ( College Catalog Collection , 1996 ) . <p> While both disciplines are concerned with improving the health of school age children , neither their teaching methods nor their body of knowledge are interchangeable ( Morris , 1991 ; Pollock &; Hamburg , 1985 ; Stroot , 1994 ) . Lavato and Rybar ( 1995 ) noted , " Because much of health instruction in schools is conducted by teachers with little or no formal preparation in health instruction , the authors conclude that lack of preparation is a major concern for the health education discipline " ( p. 172 ) . <p> The practicality of integrating all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught by one instructor is in question and not supported in current literature . Equally important , a question arises as to whether teachers who graduate with dual endorsements in health and physical education are prepared to teach health . The success of Montana 's Health Enhancement initiative , or any effort to combine health and physical education into one curriculum would seem , in large part , to depend on the ways in which teachers develop and implement such a curriculum . Therefore , the purpose of this study was twofold : ( 1 ) to determine the extent to which physical education and health education were combined into one course and taught by one instructor ; ( 2 ) to determine the extent to which these health and physical education instructors were prepared to teach health education . Methods Participants <p> The population for this study was secondary Health Enhancement teachers in the State of Montana . All 176 high schools were contacted from which 133 useable surveys were returned yielding a 75% participation rate . Ninety-five percent of the respondents were teaching classroom health education within the Health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Health Enhancement instructors were required to teach health in ninth and tenth grades at 90% of the schools , while less than 3% of the schools required health education to be taken by juniors and seniors . Eighty-three percent of the Health Enhancement teachers worked in schools with less than 1,000 students , while the remaining 17% were in schools with over 1,000 students in grades nine through twelve . Instrumentation <p> A survey instrument was developed to assess health and physical education instruction specific to Montana 's Health Enhancement curriculum . Questions on the survey addressed changes made to existing curricula as a result of the 1989 Health Enhancement initiative . Several questions focused on teacher background , undergraduate preparation , and continuing education . Content validity was established by a panel of five experts who reviewed the questionnaire , made corrections , and approved the final draft . The survey instrument was then pilot-tested by local teachers and graduate students with no clarifications needed and no recommended changes being suggested . Procedure <p> After identifying Health Enhancement teachers at the 176 high schools in Montana , a mailing was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survey introduction emphasized the importance of the study and assured each participant that individual identities and school affiliations would be protected . Instructions asked each subject to carefully read each question , complete the questionnaire , and return it in the enclosed stamped envelope ( an initial return rate of 56% was achieved ) . A follow up mailing , including letter of request and a second survey , occurred two weeks after initial surveys were sent . Specific to this study , no further contact was initiated . Results <p> Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics to establish profiles related to changes made to the curriculum , time spent teaching health , and teacher preparation . Since the Health Enhancement initiative was mandated in 1989 , less than 35% of the schools returning surveys reported adopting the new title , Health Enhancement . Sixty-two percent reported that they continue to refer to their programs as health and physical education . Only 26% of the schools had new curricula as a result of the Health Enhancement initiative , while 74% of the schools reported making no revisions or some revisions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educators ( 54.5% ) reported that they had not attended a continuing education workshop on Health Enhancement or were not aware of any being offered . <p> Results specific to curriculum changes due to the Health Enhancement initiative revealed that 50% of the schools instituted no changes to increase time allotted to health instruction ( Table 1 ) . Forty-three percent of the schools reported spending less than one forth of the time available for Health Enhancement teaching classroom health . Less than 19% of the schools reported spending over half of the time available teaching health . Specific to Health Enhancement teachers , over 66% reported never taking a college course in curriculum development of school health programs , and 33% reported they never had a health methodology component in their teacher preparation course work . In addition , less than 40% of the Health Enhancement teachers thought that physical education and health education should be combined as one course . <p> The health education content areas of the individual Health Enhancement curricula varied in topics covered ( Table 2 ) . Less than half the schools integrated topics of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and community responsibility into their curriculum . Personal health and sexually transmitted diseases ( HIV/ AIDS ) were not integrated into their curriculum by over 25% of the schools . No one topic in health education was represented by more than 85% of the schools . Health Enhancement teachers reported that they took an average of six health related courses in undergraduate teacher preparation in health education . Of the 11 health related areas listed , only four  --  nutrition , personal health , accident prevention and safety , and alcohol , tobacco , and other drug use  --  were taken by more than 50 percent of the respondents . A minimum of 21% and a maximum of 72% of the respondents were missing preparatory course work in health related content areas . Discussion <p> The concept of dual teacher certification in health education and physical education is not unique to Montana . However , combining learner outcomes in health education and physical education under the umbrella term " Health Enhancement " in grades kindergarten through grade 12 is a unique concept . This study attempted to explore the impact of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one course at the secondary level . Limitations of the study should be noted . Based on a 75% return rate , it is possible that a nonresponse bias exists . Likely , those teachers not responding to the survey were those who were not as familiar with the health enhancement concept or had not yet adjusted their curricula to meet this state mandate . Secondly , because the survey was self-reported it is possible that socially desirable responses were elicited from participants . Teachers may have wanted to portray themselves and their schools as being in compliance with the state mandate to develop health enhancement programs . Lastly , since Montana is a sparsely populated state , few high schools had more than 1,000 students . Underlying economic factors specific to smaller school districts may need to be taken into consideration as Montana and other states attempt to evaluate the practicality of dual teacher certification in physical education and health education . <p> It was somewhat disturbing to note that some high schools had not begun the process of integrating physical education and health education into one curriculum . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any revisions to their curriculum . Although nearly 65% of the respondents reported making some changes to their curriculum , it is interesting to note that over half of the respondents continue to refer to their program as Health and Physical Education and not Health Enhancement . In addition , teachers ' perceptions of whether or not health and physical education are most effectively taught separately or integrated into one course were nearly evenly divided with 40 percent of the respondents indicating their preference for integration , while 50 percent indicated their preference for separate courses , and 10 percent were left undecided . It may be reasonable to conclude that the lack of Health Enhancement implementation may be due to the fact that schools are not yet being held accountable . In fact , a new publication from the Office of Public Instruction ( OPI , 1996 ) indicated that the time frame for modifying health and physical education curricula into one curriculum has been extended until the year 2000 . Presently , there is no real consequence for a school to not follow the direction set forth in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funding ) . It may be necessary to initiate some form of political or financial consequence for failure to implement such a curricular change . <p> A second area of disturbing results was the division of time between the two content areas . Left to the discretion of individual schools , time allotted to health education was underrepresented in a majority of schools . Forty percent of the responding schools reported devoting as little as 10 to 25% of the time set aside for health enhancement to health instruction . Unfortunately , it seems that health instruction is given a less significant role in the curriculum when compared to physical education . In addition , it may be reasonable to conclude that the quality of both programs may be diminished when time allowed for Health Enhancement is divided between the two areas . <p> Lack of teacher preparation and continuing education also may have contributed to the seemingly weak emphasis placed on health instruction in some schools . An average of only six health related classes were taken at the undergraduate level . In addition , only 36% of the respondents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One has to wonder if the old adage " anyone can teach health " is n't alive and well in Montana . <p> If the concept of health enhancement is to be a workable one more emphasis must be placed on teacher preparation and continuing education in the area of health education . Teachers who have traditionally taught physical education must become more comfortable in the classroom teaching health by recognizing that " healthful physical education " is not synonymous with health education . Furthermore , the state must establish more well defined standards and learner outcomes to ensure greater consistency regarding health education content and the amount of class time devoted to health education activities versus physical education activities . It should be noted , however , that this lack of consistency may be due , in part , to the newness of the Health Enhancement initiative . At this still early stage of implementation , curriculum revisions at individual high schools may be delayed for legitimate yet undefined reasons . <p> In conclusion , this study proved to be consistent with current literature and revealed minimal support for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Montana 's Health Enhancement teachers felt that physical education and health education should be taught as separate courses . Yet with economic circumstances as they are , states with a large number of smaller rural school districts may need to consider one teacher certification for physical educators and health educators . Currently within Montana , as with other states that may be evaluating some form of dual teacher certification , greater consideration must be given to how these two unique disciplines can be combined more effectively . With an increased effort to provide continuing education and improved teacher preparation in health education , the optimism expressed by Montana 's Office of Public Instruction for Health Enhancement may become justified . At this point , however , the results from this study revealed little support by Montana 's Health Enhancement teachers for such optimism . PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> Note . Total N = 133 .
