Anyone who still believes in rigid divisions of importance between craft and fine art  --  pottery and sculpture , for instance  --  could do worse than visit the show by the California ceramist Ken Price , now on view at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis . Artists have been making sculpture out of baked clay since the dawn of time  --  mud was God 's medium for fashioning Adam  --  and yet , in America , there lingers an irrational feeling that " real " sculpture ought to be made of steel , or bronze , or stone , or wood : anything but clay , in fact . <P> Price 's work , in its terse , witty and episodically lurid sharpness , argues otherwise , and has been doing so for nearly 30 years . To complicate matters , Price plays with traditional forms of useful ceramics such as the cup and the vase without producing a usable object : they become a sort of armature for flights of entirely nonutilitarian fantasy . <P> The American preference for big art has worked against his reputation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 2 ft. high , and many of the best of them are to be measured in inches . You enter Price 's imagination from the wrong end of the telescope . His objects do n't declare themselves across the room at you . Like certain Joseph Cornell boxes , or like the tiny clay caricature heads by Daumier that so influenced Giacometti 's ideas of scale they pull you close in with their bright and almost fetishistic visual promise until you have shrunk , as it were , to their size . <P> Some have critters on them  --  a snail crawling round the base , or a worried- looking frog leaning backward ; one piece , Blind Sea Turtle Cup , 1968 , is borne on the back of a turtle laboriously crawling its way across a sandbox . Yet curiously enough , they look mysterious rather than cute . Victorian potters like Mintons produced a plethora of whimsical , curate's-joke animal majolica , laden with cows and sheep and bees and other homely creatures ; the surface of earlier French Palissy ware was encrusted with reptiles and insects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Price 's work has nothing to do with such discursive archness . And it has even less to do with the Bernard Leach tradition of quiet good taste and honesty in materials that grew out of Chinese and Japanese ceramics . As Edward Lebow points out in his engaging catalog introduction to this show , Price , from his student days in Peter Voulkos ' West Coast classes , " devoted much of his studio effort to clearing his throat and going ptooey on ' creative craft ' and ' good design . ' " <P> Right from the start , Voulkos  --  the father figure of California pottery at the time and for decades thereafter  --  inspired Price to break the rules , and the most binding of these was the integrity of the glaze : all color on a ceramic object had to come either from the clay itself or from the glazes that , through firing , were bonded to it . But this was California , the territory of outlaw artificial color , metal flake , Duco gloss , candy stripes , epoxy bases . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Voulkos ' work ; he wanted a more concise style of object , perverse in its craftsmanship and highly mannered .
