THE THUNDERSTORM <p> washed its way closer . The rain pounded on the roof , lightning flashed , thunder grumbled in the night and the dark , damp wind moaned softly at the edges of the big old two-story house . <p> " A f**king frog-drowner out there , " Granddaddy Bill said . Granddaddy Bill was sick again- though Grandma Annabelle said it was only a hangover - so Harold and Johnny decided to tell him a story to make him feel better . <p> Harold , nine , usually took the lead , while Johnny , six , mostly did chorus . <p> Even though it was past their bedtime , Grandma Annabelle let them stay up to visit with Granddaddy Bill because he did n't feel good . Plus they were going back to their house on Monday , since school started in a few days . <p> It had been a pretty boring summer so far . <p> The boys perched on the foot of the old man 's musty old bed and waited for Granddaddy Bill to sip more of his toddy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , good for colds , flu , consumption and the rheumatiz . Granddaddy Bill 's bedroom always smelled like pipe tobacco , Southern Comfort and Old Spice . And mold . Grandma Annabelle 's bedroom smelled like perfume . <p> " So , what story are you going to tell me ? " he said . He put the toddy down . <p> " How about the Creature from Black Bottom Bayou ? " Harold said . <p> " The Creature is o-kkkay ... " Johnny drawled . " Though it 's not as good as Jurassic Park . Those dinosaurs were cool ! " <p> Granddaddy Bill sneezed , used a tissue to blow his nose . Threw the soggy clump of tissue on the floor next to the bed where another dozen wads of it already lay . " Where 'd you hear this Creature story ? " <p> Johnny bounced up and down on the bed , said , " You told it to us , Granddaddy ! " <p> The old man smiled . " So I did . But you know us old people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> Harold took a deep breath and started . " Once upon a time , in Lafayette , Louisiana , in this very house , many , many , many years ago , there were two brothers who came to visit their Grandma . " <p> " Yeah , yeah , that was you and Great-Uncle-Richie , right , Granddaddy ? And you were visiting Great-Great Grandma Phyllis . " <p> " Shut up , Johnny , " Harold said . " And sit still . " <p> " I 'm gon na tell Grandma Annabelle you said ' Shut up ' ! " <p> " Go ahead . You 'll miss the story . " <p> Johnny shut up . <p> " Anyway , they slept in the Piano Room , which had French doors that opened out on the back yard , just like they do now . The yard ran straight to Black Bottom Bayou , less than a hundred feet away , just like it does now . It was a summer night , just like it is now and it was raining , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waves , hard , then soft , then hard again . The wind blew and moaned softly at the edges of the house . When the lightning flashed , Billy and Richie could see Black Bottom Bayou gurgling past , oily , sluggish and as dark as its name . The frogs were going crazy . Every once in a while , Molly - that was Grandma Phyllis 's three-legged pomeranian - Molly would wake up and yip , but the little dog 's yappy bark did n't make the boys feel any better . When it came down to it , Molly would n't be much help . She was afraid of Cisco and Pancho and they were just parakeets . <p> " F* king stinking parakeets who sh " t on everything , " Granddaddy Carl had said more than a few times . <p> Billy clutched at his Red Ryder BB gun , the plastic stock slippery with sweat . He was n't supposed to load or cock it in the house but you better believe it was loaded and cocked now . A whole pack of BBs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BB gun , which was too bad . Two guns would be better than one when the Monster came . And if ever it was gon na come , this was the night for it . <p> " I 'm scared , " Richie said . <p> " Do n't worry , I 've got Old Betsy here . " He patted the gun . BB 's rattled inside it . He 'd named her after Davy Crockett 's rifle . " If it tries to get in , I 'll shoot its eyes out . " <p> " Wh-what if you miss ? " <p> " I wo n't miss . You remember that water moccasin ? I hit it in the head , did n't I ? And that turtle ? And those frogs ? And that mockingbird ? And you better not even think about telling Grandma Phyllis about the bird . " <p> " I wo n't tell , but - a monster is different , Billy . " <p> Billy nodded silently . Yeah , that was sure right . Ever since Grandma Phyllis had dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Theater while she 'd gone shopping , they 'd been expecting to see it . Earth Versus the Flying Saucers had n't been so bad , but The Creature from the Black Lagoon , well , that was something else . The flying saucers were in Washington , that was a million miles away , but the Creature lived in a bayou . At night here in the Piano Room , where they slept on the pink-and-blue couch and matching love seat , looking straight at the bayou , they knew it was out there . A couple of nights , they were pretty sure they 'd heard it splashing around , making weird noises . They 'd looked for footprints during the daytime , but the thing was pretty smart , it must have covered them up . But they had found dead catfish that had been partially eaten and they knew : It had been there . Before he went back to his job on the oil rigs , Granddaddy Carl had told them it was the snapping turtles who ate the catfish but Billy did n't believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it got tired of eating fish ... <p> A gust of wind rattled the French doors . <p> " Maybe the fence will stop it , " Richie said . <p> " Shoot , the Creature could rip it apart like it was old rotten kite string . Or jump right over it . " The little chain link fence was just high enough to keep three-legged Molly in the yard . Even Richie could climb over it in about two seconds . <p> " I 'm scared , Billy . " <p> " It 's okay . I 'll protect us . " <p> But he was nervous . <p> The lamp on the table flickered . <p> " What 's that ? ! " <p> " It 's okay . Just the lightning making the power ... f**kshuate . " That 's what Granddaddy Carl had said it did when it stormed . <p> The light went out . <p> Richie squealed . <p> " It 's okay , it 's okay ! Get out your flashlight ! " <p> Billy dug his own light out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an emergency <p> Suddenly he went blind . <p> " Jesus , Richie , get that out of my face ! Point it at the door , not at me ! " <p> The two ghostly rings of light danced across the French doors . Lightning flared , thunder rumbled right after it . Close . <p> " What 's that ? ! " Richie said . <p> " What ? " <p> " Outside , I saw something out there ! " <p> Billy was trying to point his flashlight and hold the BB gun at the same time . The light would have to go , he could n't shoot too good with one hand . " Shine your light on it , " he whispered . He raised the BB gun and propped it on the arm of the couch , aimed at the doors . " I got it covered . " <p> Nothing happened for a few seconds . <p> All of a sudden , Billy needed to go pee , real bad . <p> Lightning struck the oak tree down by the fence . Thunder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glass , but he could n't see , because the lightning blinded him again . <p> This time , Billy 's eyes took a few seconds for the purple spots to fade . When he could see again , the first thing he noticed was that the French doors were wide open . <p> He said the F-word . <p> " What ? What ? " Richie said . He had burrowed down in the couch cushions , but he came up to see what was going on . <p> " The thunder knocked the doors open ! Quick , go close them . " <p> " Not me ! You go close them ! " <p> " I have to stand guard . Go on . I 'll cover you . " <p> " I 'm not going . " <p> " Richie ... " <p> " No ! You go ! " <p> Billy glared at his little brother . " Go or I 'll shoot you . " He waved the BB gun . <p> " I 'm gon na tell Grandma Phyllis ! " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go and shut the f**king doors . Now ! " <p> But before anybody could move , lightning struck again . <p> Outlined against the white flash in the doorway stood the Creature . <p> Both Billy and Richie screamed . <p> " Why did n't Great-Great-Grandma Phyllis wake up when the lightning struck ? " Johnny asked . " Or when Billy and Richie screamed ? " <p> " Because she was as deaf as toast , " Harold said . <p> " Deaf as a post , " Granddaddy Bill put in . " Although toast probably does n't hear too good , either , come to think of it . Go on . " <p> " I bet it was n't as scary as the dinosaurs from Jurassic Park , " Johnny said . <p> " Shut up , Johnny . Well , there it was . just like from the movie . Big , green , scaly , dripping water all over Grandma Phyllis 's Persian rug ... " <p> Billy , even though terrified , whipped his Daisy air rifle up and fired . In his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the thing was so close he could n't miss . <p> He did n't miss . <p> " Hey ! Ow ! " the Creature said . <p> The lights came back on . <p> The Creature , seven-feet-tall if it was an inch , rubbed at his chest with a webbed and clawed hand . Slimy water dripped out of its gills . It looked at Billy , who sat on the couch open-mouthed . " What 'd you go and do that for ? That stings . " <p> The Creature 's voice was burbly . He coughed , hawked , and spat something onto the rug . It was a crawfish . The mudbug bounced onto its back . Righted itself , then scuttled backward under the couch . " Shoulda chewed you better , " the monster said . <p> " Grandma Phyllis is gon na be mad about the wet rug , " Richie said . " And she do n't let us bring crawfish into the house . Or snakes . " <p> " Why do n't you put that thing away , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Billy had forgotten to recock his gun anyway , he was so surprised . The Creature said , " Boy , it 's a terrible night out there . Got the gar all stirred up . " <p> Billy and Richie looked at each other . <p> " You can talk . How come you did n't talk in the movie ? " Richie asked . <p> " Oh , you saw that ? I thought I did okay , but I 'm not writing my acceptance speech , if you know what I mean . Being mute , that was for dramatic effect , " the Creature said . " Director had his own ' vision . ' Pah . Reason I do n't do much work out there , if I can help it . They all got vision . ' Okay if I sit down ? " <p> " On Grandma 's couch ? Are you crazy ? You 're all wet ! " Billy was horrified . <p> " Yeah , well , I live in a f*-king bayou , now , do n't I ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's already wet . " <p> " Grandma 's gon na be mad . " <p> " Hey , I 'm tired here . F " k Grandma . " <p> " Ca n't , " Richie said . <p> " Ca n't sit down ? " <p> " No , ca n't f* *k Grandma . That 's what Granddaddy Carl says . That 's why he goes to the oil rigs so much , " Richie said . <p> The Creature laughed . It was a wheezy , wet sound , but it was a laugh . " Ah , your Granddaddy Carl , he 's a character . So he 's gone again , huh ? " <p> " To the oil rigs , " Richie repeated . <p> " Just between us , kid , he stops off at a place in New Iberia on his way to the rigs . A fancy cathouse - not that I 've been there myself . Guy like me does n't have to pay for it . " <p> " Pay for what ? " Billy asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do that ? Granddaddy does n't even like cats , " Johnny added . <p> The Creature made that wheezy , wet sound again . <p> " What 's so funny ? " <p> " Give it a few years , kid , you 'll understand when you 're older . " <p> The boys looked at each other . Mom and Dad said that a lot . <p> The Creature sat . He crossed his legs . A puddle formed around his body on the rug . " I do n't suppose either of you play chess ? " <p> " No . But we play poker . Granddaddy Carl taught us . " <p> " No shot ? Hey , great . Get the cards . Play for matches ? " <p> " You have matches ? " <p> " Do I look like I have a lot of use for matches , kid ? We 'll use yours . I 'll give ' em back after I win . " <p> " Billy . My name is Billy . This is Richie . " <p> " Billy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with your Granddaddy , but poker is okay . " <p> " You play chess with Granddaddy Carl ? He knows about you ? " <p> " Sure . We 've been playing for years . Usually on rainy summer nights . When lightning strikes the water out there , it gets real uncomfortable , you know ? Dead fish floating around , the gar get to snapping at everything , the turtles get spastic . Tingles like hell , too . You know how nasty garfish can be when they get squirrelly ? Like big ole mosquitoes . Not to even mention the ' gators . I try to avoid the place until the lightning stops . So , you want to play poker or what ? " <p> " I 'll get the cards , " Richie said . <p> " That 's three matches to you , " Billy said . <p> " Keep your pajamas on , I 'm thinking here , " Howie said . He looked at his cards . Howie had at least one ace , Billy knew , because the fish man had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of hands back and Billy saw it . Probably had a pair of aces , since it was jacks or better to open and he 'd opened . <p> " I think you 're bluffing , " Howie said . " I see your three and raise you two . " <p> He tossed five matches into the pot , <p> " I fold , " Richie said . He threw his cards down on the rug . " All I had was a f* *king pair of threes . " <p> " Do n't say f " k , " Billy said . <p> " Howie says it . Granddaddy Carl says it . Daddy says it , you say it - " <p> " They 're grownups and I 'm older than you . You ca n't say f *k until you 're at least nine . " <p> " You said it last year when you were eight , " Richie allowed . <p> " Fine . When you 're eight , you can , but since you 're only six , you ca n't , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Okay , I 'll see your two and raise you two more . " <p> Howie glanced down at his cards , then at Billy , then back at his cards again . Billy kept his poker face on , just like Granddaddy Carl had taught him . <p> " All right . Take it . " Howie tossed his cards face down . " I had a pair of aces . What did you have ? " " You got ta pay to see ' em , " Billy said . <p> " Jeezus , kid , who do you think you are ? Bret Maverick ? We 're playing for matches here ! " <p> " Well , okay . I had two pair , sixes and nines . " He turned his cards over . <p> " Your Granddaddy teach you how to deal from the bottom when he showed you how to play this game ? Gim me the cards . My deal . Five card draw , nothing is wild , jacks or better . " <p> Howie picked up the deck . Considering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he shuffled pretty good . He started to deal , but Billy stopped him . " Do n't I get to cut ? " <p> Howie shook his head . He looked up at the ceiling . " Spare me . Amarillo Slim here thinks I 'm cheating for matches . " The crawfish he 'd coughed up earlier suddenly scuttled out from under the couch . Billy did n't know where it thought it was going . Howie reached over , real fast , and grabbed the crawfish . It wriggled in his claws for a second before he popped it into his mouth and ate it . It crunched in his teeth as he chewed . " Gotcha this time , Houdini . " Howie said . <p> " Eyuuw , " Richie said . <p> " Tastes just like chicken , kid . Here , cut . " <p> Lying in bed , propped up on four pillows , Granddaddy Bill smiled . " Pass me the toddy , would you , Harold ? " <p> The old man took a big drink . " Ah . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost all his matches trying to draw to an inside straight pretty early . After Billy cleaned Howie out on a hand of showdown , Howie said , " Jeezus . Beaten by a nine-year-old kid . " He glanced at the ceiling , then outside through the French doors . " Still coming down pretty good out there . You know where your Granddaddy keeps the chess board ? " <p> " Sure . Under the kitchen cabinet , next to the bug spray and the Old Crow and Camels . " <p> " Why do n't you run get it and I 'll teach you how to play . Maybe I can beat you at that . So far this evening , my ego 's getting the shit kicked out of it . " <p> " Go get it , Richie , " Billy said . <p> " Why do I have to go get it ? It 's dark in the kitchen . I 'm afraid . " <p> " You 're stupid , you know that ? What are you afraid of ? We got a monster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be worse in the kitchen ? " <p> " Thanks , kid . You ai n't no prize yourself , you know . Some jug must be real unhappy you swiped its handles for your ears . " <p> " Go on , Richie . " <p> Richie went and got the chess board . <p> " Okay , here 's the deal . These are the pawns , they only move like this ... " <p> Howie won all the chess games , but that was okay . They played for a long time . Richie fell asleep on the floor and Howie put him on the couch and covered him with the sheet . A little while later , the rain stopped , and just before dawn , they heard somebody flush the toilet down the hall . <p> " Unless that gimpy little dog is a lot smarter than it looks , that 's your granny . I better hit the water , kid . I do n't want the old lady to find me here . Carl would never hear the end of it . Probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> He stood , pretty dry now , though the rug was still wet . <p> " Thank you for teaching us how to play chess , Howie . " <p> " No sweat , kid . Thanks for the poker game . Billy , right ? See you later . " <p> The sun was n't up but it was getting light . Billy watched as Howie padded across the squishy back yard , opened the gate and closed it behind himself , then waded into the bayou . After a second , he disappeared into the murky water . <p> Grandma was mad about the rug and she took away Billy 's BB gun for three days but that did n't really matter - he did n't much need the gun after that . <p> What was going to bother them with Howie around ? <p> " That 's a pretty good story , " Granddaddy Bill said . " You think it 's true ? " <p> Both Harold and Johnny laughed . <p> " Come on , Granddaddy ! A seven-foot-tall monster coming out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And not even as scary as a dinosaur , " johnny added . <p> " Oh , really ? " said a burbly voice from behind them . <p> Harold and Johnny turned as one , eyes going wide . <p> " I got your Jurassic Park right here , kid , " the seven-foot-tall monster said . <p> " Fa vk ! " Harold and Johnny said together . <p> Granddaddy Bill laughed so hard that some of the toddy came out of his nose , but after that everything was just fine . Howie and Granddaddy Bill played chess . <p> Granddaddy Bill beat him two out of three . <p> " I never should have taught you this game , " the Creature said . <p> And , when you got right down to it , the summer turned out not to be so boring after all . <p> Author Affiliation
