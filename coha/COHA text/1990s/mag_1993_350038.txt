It seemed simple at first . There were people in need . America would help . But the mission to Somalia , which began with visions of charity , now puts forth images of horror . While America 's attention was focused at home , the goals of the mission shifted dangerously , and now the effort threatens to become a violent standoff . Here 's how it happened . <P> For Carlos Rodriguez the battle was a few seconds of terror , hours of agonized waiting . While his comrades stormed the building near the Olympic Hotel in Mogadishu to try to snatch Somali warlord Mohammed Farrah Aidid , Rodriguez and the rest of his squad swarmed down ropes from a helicopter and began a security patrol through a nearby street .

" All of a sudden the Somalis just opened up on us , small arms and grenades . There was shooting from all directions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . I saw a muzzle once , sticking around a corner , and I shot at it . " Almost instantly , though , Rodriguez himself " got shot in the right hip . Then I got some shrapnel in my left foot and a little bit in my face . It broke some bones , and I was down . Our squad leader got hit too . It got pretty confusing . " <P> The confusion only grew worse . " Some of our buddies pulled us into a room " in a nearby house , recalled Rodriguez , an Army Ranger specialist four .

I was bleeding pretty good , but ( ( a unit medic ) ) came and put pressure pants on me . " ( These are inflatable sleeves used to immobilize limbs and stop bleeding . ) Then " we just waited and waited "  --  for almost eight hours , until rescuers arrived . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ) . I do n't know exactly why . "
