<p> Lamia Mufarreh stood with her arms around a young cousin , a circle of quiet in a hotel lobby packed with people talking , laughing , kissing and saying goodbye . <p> Mufarreh 's bags were packed and she , too , was ready to start the long trip home . In four days , Mufarreh estimated , she had slept maybe 12 hours , as illustrated by the dark circles under her eyes . <p> But Mufarreh was content , and so were the rest of the weary group around her . After all , when you spend the weekend trying to catch up with nearly 4,000 cousins , all attending the 40th annual convention of the American Federation of Ramallah , Palestine , there 's little time left for sleep . <p> " I 've had a great time , " said Mufarreh , a veteran of many such gatherings . <p> " And so have I , " chimed in Michael Balat , 10 , who was attending his first Ramallah family reunion , held in Houston at the Adam 's Mark Hotel last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face , it wo n't be his last . <p> And that makes the older generation happy , because renewing family ties and maintaining their cultural heritage is part of what the reunion is all about . " Our roots run deep , " was the theme of this year 's convention and a point returned to again and again during the long , lively weekend . The roots can be traced back 500 years to one Christian Arab family who founded the West Bank village of Ramallah and now has some 37,000 descendants in the United States , with an estimated 3,000 in Houston . <p> " ' He is my cousin and she is my cousin ' is kind of the buzzword of the convention , " said George Zaibaq , with a twinkle in his eye . " Some are first cousins , and others may be cousins 20 times removed , but the connection is still there and is a very strong bond for us . I have 26 first cousins in Houston , and when I first came here from Ramallah to go to college , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family would be there for me . We stand for each other . " <p> The family 's unique story is steeped in the oral traditions of the Middle East . Anyone at the Ramallah family reunion could tell you the narrative , although each version might be slightly different . But it also has been backed up by extensive genealogy work done by scholars such as Azeez Shaheen and his son Naseeb , whose book A Pictorial History of Ramallah , traces the history of the family back to 1186 . It was one of a number of items on sale at the convention 's popular Arabic coffee shop , where elderly men played cards and drank endless cups of fragant coffee , while others bought T-shirts and munched on baklava . <p> Ramallah 's story begins with a man named Rashed Al-Haddad , who lived with his Arab Christian family east of the Jordan River , surrounded by a powerful Moslem clan . One day the prince of the clan came to visit the Haddads and was told of the recent birth of a girl . In spite of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby girl as a wife for one of his sons . Startled by the request , Sabra Haddad , Rashed 's brother , agreed , hoping to avoid problems . <p> But , the story goes , when the girl grew up and the prince renewed his request , a feud erupted . Eventually Sabra and his brothers , including Rashed , fled across the Dead Sea and founded Ramallah , 10 miles north of Jerusalem around 1550 ( according to an Ottoman census ) . Sabra eventually reconciled with the prince and returned to Jordan , while Rashed and his sons - Haddad , Hassan , Shukair , Ibrahim and Jeries , stayed and became founders of the Ramallah family tree . Descendants of the five sons are subdivided into five clans . <p> Sound complicated ? Not to the Ramallah cousins , who seem familiar with every twist and turn of their family 's genealogy . <p> Recognizing that it takes work to keep a family together , the Ramallah cousins launched the annual get-together in 1958 . Issa Baba , this year 's convention chairman , attended the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and said he has been to 37 more since then . <p> During the years , the federation has changed from strictly a family affair , in which people maintained friendships and romances often bloomed , to a group with a broader agenda . As the Middle East crisis worsened , increasing numbers of the Ramallah family emigrated to the United States , especially after the 1967 Arab-Israeli War when Ramallah and other villages became part of the Israeli-occupied West Bank . Today , only 5,000 members of the original family are left in Ramallah , a city of 100,000 now under the rule of the Palestinian National Authority . <p> Though the gathering is cordial , participants have n't always seen eye to eye . The newer immigrants wanted the federation and the family to be more politically involved , but many of the old guard wanted things to stay the same . Even a name change , such as adding Palestine to the American Federation of Ramallah , as they did in the early ' 90s , caused much debate . " They wanted it to remain a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of where our family comes from , it is political . . . . " <p> " When our fathers came , they were peddlars and merchants , and their philosophy was to stay with their family and children and not get involved in politics , " Foteh said . " When new families came in , we would set things up for them and had our own system going . We never asked for outside help . And during the terrible times , we often called ourselves Arabic , Lebanese or Syrian , because of the image . " <p> Foteh now believes that was a mistake . <p> " If back in the old days we had told people : ' Yes , I 'm Palestinian , ' people would associate us with the grocery stores and delis where they shopped , the gas stations where they fueled up , instead of the negative images . " <p> Besides getting more involved in their own communities , the federation , a nonprofit organization , is now the largest Palestinian-American group , representing more than 20 Ramallah clubs . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meetings on the Middle East peace process . The educational fund has donated more than $ 1 million in college scholarships to students in Ramallah and the United States , says past president Samir Mashni and many thousands more to the Ramallah Hospital Foundation and the Palestinian Relief Fund . <p> At this year 's meeting , the federation issued a number of political resolutions , including calling for the establishment of an independent Palestine by May 1999 in line with the Oslo accords , as well as a request to lift the Iraqi embargo . <p> But politics aside - and at this meeting there was very little politics , Zaibaq said - the bread and butter of the annual meetings are maintaining family ties and getting the younger generations involved . <p> " Family ties and the family unit , attending to the elderly , are the essence of the Arab culture , " Zaibaq said . " It 's even stronger for the Ramallah people since we all belong to one family . " <p> When the multigenerational groups of families - the youngest attendee was Alexander Zaibaq @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was the oldest - come together from all over the United States , and as far away as Ramallah and Brazil , they also like to have fun . For four days , the cousins danced and listened to Arabic music at nightly haflehs ( parties ) , ate , drank endless cups of coffee and talked up a storm - sometimes till 2 and 3 a.m . <p> The older and younger generations gathered in the hotel lobby last Friday for " Face Off , " billed as an Oprah Winfrey-style discussion . New this year , the standing-room-only event was subtitled " Maintaining Your Sanity Living Between Two Cultures " and was moderated by Zaibaq and Nahedah Zayed . <p> Spurred on by the two , who walked around with microphones , discussions touched on strict dating codes , the generation gap faced by the professional younger generation , the stress of expensive weddings and the struggles faced trying to maintain a strong cultural heritage while still being part of mainstream American culture . <p> Panel member Mary Ann Tawasha , 26 , recalled her fear when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from North Carolina to Houston to look for a job . Fortunately , she said , her parents reacted positively . " In our culture , " she said . " Women live at home until they get married . " <p> Down the hall from the " Face Off " crowd , younger Ramallah cousins , from age 4 to 12 , participated in the Children 's Culture Camp . One group listened intently to Julie Foteh read from Sitti 's Secrets , by Naomi Shihab Nye , a story about a little girl who has only seen her Arabic grandmother once in her life . Another small group created colorful images of their grandmothers on large paper-doll cutouts . Others made worry beads and Palestinian flags or worked on a Ramallah family tree project , " Under the Olive Tree . " Later they planned to put on a Palestinian play . <p> Zaibaq firmly believes the family ties and cultural heritage will make his four children stronger and better American citizens , able to hold their own in today 's global economy . His children visit Ramallah often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the birth of her grandson , as well as the convention . <p> Because of their desire to get the younger generation involved , the federation started a service organization several years ago , called Project Hope . The goal is to strengthen ties with their homeland and show Palestinians in Ramallah and under Israeli occupation that there is still hope , Zaibaq said . Julie Eadeh , 21 , was one of about 20 young people who accompanied Samir Mashni to Ramallah for a 10-day visit that included projects ranging from helping in day care centers and hospitals to planting flowers and clearing garbage . <p> When she read her four-page report in front of the convention 's business meeting , it brought tears to the eyes of many of her cousins . <p> " It changed my life , " said Eadeh later , wearing the red T-shirt with white dove and olive branches that she wore on the trip . " I 've always been told stories about Ramallah and its history . But I did n't understand until I got there . It 's not easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you feel very defensive about who you are . <p> " I do n't have questions about who I am anymore ; it 's much more clear to me now . "
