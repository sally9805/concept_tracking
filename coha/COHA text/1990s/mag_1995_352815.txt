Over since he voted last November , Vin Thomlin has won-dered whether it was worth it . Out of sheer indignation about the state of things in America , he went to the polls for the first time in more than a decade . And he voted Republican across the board for the first time in his life . He started having regrets almost immediately . I was only gone for about an hour , but when I got back to my apartment , I 'd been burglarized . My stereo , TV , money , everything , ' ' says the 46-year-old Milwaukee , Wisconsin , handyman . As Thomlin tells the story , he slams the nearest piece of wood with his fist . You know what really kills me ? ' ' he asks with a bitter chuckle . The whole goddam reason I voted was because I 'm so sick of crime and the lack of values in this country . ' ' Now Thomlin relies on his own solution : he keeps a tire iron in his bedroom for protection . <P> Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fronts . At the polls last November , voters told Bill Clinton they were unhappy with his progress and urged Newt Gingrich &; Co. to try something different . When you have a wholesale change of government during a period of peace and prosperity , that means the populace thinks something is really wrong , ' ' says James Newby , who retired this month as police chief of Dayton , Ohio . But there is another revolution , one that is happening in homes and neighborhoods and statehouses . Disgusted with American institutions ranging from the post office to the press , citizens are responding not just with anger and cynicism but with increased resourcefulness as well . <P> Pick just about any major institution , and chances are Americans are scrambling to find a more agreeable substitute . The Yankelovich Monitor , an annual survey of 4,000 Americans based on interviews conducted in their homes , shows a steep erosion of trust in traditional authority . Among the fallen : doctors , religious leaders , big companies , schools and especially the Federal Government . What makes people in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in 1994 , up from 44% the previous year , is people in positions of power who say one thing and do another . ' ' <P> Partly by default , perhaps , Americans now put more trust in themselves than in authority figures . In the 1994 Monitor survey , 80% expressed strong confidence in their own abilities , up 8 points from the previous year . The new measure of success , a growing majority declared , is being in control of their lives . Says Roger Conner , a Washington lobbyist for community organizations : Responsibility is the key word for the ' 90s . ' ' For better and for worse , that renewed self-reliance is reshaping the way Americans educate their children , protect their families , invest their savings , run their communities , maintain their health and view their government .
