Bill Clinton never experienced hostile fire in Vietnam or anywhere else , but last week the future Commander in Chief learned firsthand what baptism by fire means . His affirmation of his campaign pledge to lift the Pentagon 's ban on homosexuals serving in the military triggered such anger , especially in the Pentagon , that he was forced to add that the step would be taken only after consultation with " a lot of people . " <P> Critics , including all the military-service chiefs , charged that Clinton 's lack of military experience showed that his insensitivity was surpassed only by his ignorance on the issue . Republican Senator Bob Dole warned that Clinton would " get in more trouble than he can add up right now if he starts with an Executive Order " to change policy . Partisans of change  --  especially among homosexual groups that contributed to Clinton 's campaign  --  were determined to take Clinton at his word . " Mr. Clinton committed himself , " said Tanya Domi of the Gay , Lesbian and Bisexual Veterans of America , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lost in the furor was precisely what Clinton is proposing . Under Department of Defense regulations , which were strongly criticized in a General Accounting Office report earlier this year , simply being homosexual is enough to provoke expulsion without any evidence of misconduct . Since 1982 , more than 14,000 people have been kicked out of the military ; women were six times as likely to be expelled as men in what has often amounted to witch-hunts . Clinton takes great care to emphasize the difference between sexual orientation and conduct . % Simple homosexual proclivity , he argued , should not be grounds for expulsion . " Clinton 's not advocating a homosexual life-style , " says Lawrence Korb , a military expert at the Brookings Institution . " He 's just supporting the human rights of those persons who are . " <P> The nuances in Clinton 's plan went widely unrecognized among military personnel , who barraged the President-elect with bitter criticism , arguing that homosexuals would undermine good order and morale . The tight personal living arrangements in the military , many Pentagon hands contend , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all the uproar , there were signs that Clinton was winning support . Polls show a majority of the public favors lifting the ban . In contrast to Senator Sam Nunn 's harsh criticism , House Armed Services Chairman Les Aspin was quietly supporting the initiative . Even General Colin Powell , Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , was having second thoughts . Although not backing away from his support for the current policy , Powell announced that the armed forces stand " ready to do what we 're told . "
