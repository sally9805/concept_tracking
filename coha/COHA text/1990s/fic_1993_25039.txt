 | Maud felt as if she could not breathe . She plucked at her father 's sleeve and whispered , " Papa , I need to talk to you  --  please ! Can we go somewhere alone ? " * They went through the wide double doors into the music room . It seemed a lifetime , Maud thought , since she and Mr. Kestrel had talked here . " Well , what 's the matter ? " Craddock asked . " Papa , are you ? " She swallowed hard . " Do you think you ought to let Lady Tarleton say things that are n't true ? " " What are you talking about ? " he said sharply . " She said she never came out of her room till dinnertime , and I know that is n't so . " " What do you know about where Lady Tarleton was this afternoon ? " " I only know about the end of the afternoon . She was n't in her room , Papa . She was in yours . " He drew breath as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came out in a rasping whisper . " How do you know that ? " " Well , you know I went out this afternoon with Josie and Pippa and Miss Pritchard . Miss Pritchard and I got talking , and I thought how hard she works , and what a dull life she has . And she is n't so very old . It would be nice for her to go on holiday and have a little fun once in a while ? " " Has this got anything to do with what I asked you ? " " Yes , Papa . Because I was thinking that , if Sir Robert and Lady Fontclair did n't mind , I 'd invite Miss Pritchard to London for a few days . She could help with the wedding preparations . She so liked hearing about my trousseau , and the wedding breakfast , and every-thing . " She hurried on , seeing his patience was almost gone . " So when we got home , I went to your room to ask you if that would be all right . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I heard Lady Tarleton 's voice inside . And I was so surprised , I just stood there and could n't move or do anything at all . " 1 pIOI He stared at her , his breath coming quickly . " And then what happened ? " " I did something very wrong . I ? I listened for a while . I 'm sorry . It was just that the conversation was so strange . It scared me . I ? oh , Papa , do n't look at me like that ! " " My God , how much did you overhear ? What do you know ? " Her throat closed up , and she could not answer . " Tell me , damn it ! " He took a few steps toward her . " I ? I was only there a few minutes ! I do n't know much at all ! And what I did hear , I did n't understand . " " Tell me everything you heard , from the beginning . " Maud repeated it all as best she could . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and I thought Lady Tarleton was coming out , and I ran to my room . I could n't face her . I felt so shocked and confused . " " Have you told me the truth ? Is that really everything you heard ? " " Yes , Papa . I promise . " He looked intently into her eyes . " All right , I believe you . Now listen to me carefully . You 're not to tell anyone about Lady Tarleton being in my room , and you 're not to repeat a word of what you heard us say . Do you understand ? " " But  --  but what if somebody asks what I was doing this afternoon ? You said we might all be questioned by Sir Robert , or the Bow Street Runners . " " Then you 'll say you went on an outing with the Misses Fontclair , and when you got home , you went to your room . You do n't have to lie  --  just leave out the part about Lady Tarleton and me . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Are you sure ? " " What do you mean , am I sure ? Of course I 'm sure ! " " But some of what you and Lady Tarleton said sounded so strange . And there 's some secret between you and the Fontclairs , and I wondered ? " " Well , stop wondering ! What 's between me and the Fontclairs is my business , not yours . And I warn you , if you breathe a word about what you overheard Lady Tarleton and me say , you 'll do more  | harm than you can begin to guess . You do n't understand what you 're meddling in . The Fontclairs wo n't thank you , and neither will I. " " But if it might help solve the murder ? " " It wo n't . Do n't be a fool , Maud . You 're going to be part of this family soon . You do n't want to bring it into disgrace . " For Hugh 's sake , no , that 's the last thing I want , she thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd only been able to find Mr. Kestrel before dinner , I could have asked him what he thought that conversation between Papa and Lady Tarleton meant . Now I ca n't talk to him about it . Because , as long as I do n't know what harm I might do by telling anyone , how can I take the risk ? * Sir Robert had much the same theory about the murder as Lady Fontclair . " I believe some intruder broke into the house , most likely bent on robbery . He brought the girl with him  --  they quarrelled ? he killed her , and afterward fled from the house . Rawlinson , make a note to have the house searched . I want to know if anything is missing . " " Yes , sir , " said Rawlinson , from his seat at the desk in the window recess . He had lit an oil lamp to relieve the dusk , and its ruddy glow illumined the stained glass behind him and conjured up long , wavering shadows on the walls of Julian 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house searched in any case , " said Julian , " to see if there are traces of the girl or her murderer anywhere besides this room . I suppose we do n't even know for certain she was killed in here , do we ? She might have been killed somewhere else in the house and brought here afterward . " " I ca n't see the murderer traipsing about the house with a dead woman in his arms , " said MacGregor . " No , " admitted Julian , " neither can I. All the same , it might not be a bad idea to look in the rooms nearby for bloodstains or signs of a struggle . " " Make a note of that , too , Rawlinson , " said Sir Robert wearily . " For that matter , I ca n't believe this room 's yielded up all its secrets . " Julian lit a candle at the oil lamp and bent to examine the  | carpet . " There 's dirt on the carpet , and I do n't believe it was here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember my boots were muddy when I came back from the horse fair , and Dipper made a point of taking them away to be cleaned before I set foot in here . " He glanced critically at the feet of the other three men . " It does n't look as if any of us tracked the dirt in here . Whereas the girl 's shoes are very dirty , although she seems to have tried to scrape them clean . " He picked up her shoes . They were made of pale blue silk brocade , torn , frayed , and very soiled . There were green stains on and around the soles . He pointed out jagged lines running through the grime on the bottoms , where she had evidently tried to scrape off the dirt . " If it was the girl 's shoes  --  and possibly the murderer 's  --  that tracked the dirt in here , it might give us some idea where in the room they went and what they did . The trouble is , there 's not enough dirt to make anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candle , peering closely at the carpet . " Most of the dirt seems to be along the side of the bed nearest the door . There 's some at the foot of the bed  --  but not a hint of it anywhere near the washstand , although we know the murderer went there to wash off the blood . I wonder if that means the murderer 's shoes were clean ? Insofar as there 's anything like a trail , it leads this way . " He walked from the door , down the length of the bed , and then to the left . He came to a halt at the wall , straightened up , and stood staring at the wood panelling . " Dr. MacGregor ? " he said , without turning around . The others joined him . By the light of his candle , they could see dark smears along the wall , hardly visible save at close range . The smears varied from perhaps one to two inches long . Three of them formed a horizontal line at eye level , about an inch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , somewhat fainter , about a foot below and to the right . " What do you think that is ? " asked Julian , although he was fairly sure he knew already . MacGregor scraped a little bit off with his thumbnail . " I 'd say it 's almost certainly blood . "  | Julian took a few steps back and gazed around him . To the right , the wall turned a right-angle corner and gave way to the window embrasure . To the left was the fireplace . The intervening wall space , where the stains were , was about a yard wide . Just in front stood the shieldback chair where the girl 's shawl and bonnet were found . " Do you suppose this is where she was killed ? " asked Julian . " Could be , " said MacGregor . " There are all kinds of possibilities . Maybe she 'd just been laying her outdoor things on that chair when the murderer came up behind her and pushed her against the wall and stabbed her . " " Or perhaps she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put her things on again , " said Julian . " There 's a scratch along the back of the chair that suggests it might have been knocked against the wall in a struggle . Yes , look , there 's a scratch on the wall at the same level . And the scratches look freshly made . " Sir Robert frowned . " If the girl were held with her face to the wall and stabbed in the back , how did the blood get on the wall ? " " The murderer could have touched the wall while his fingers were stained with blood , " said MacGregor . " That would explain the small separate smudges . " Julian held up his hand to the wall and found that the three smears at eye level were about the right distance apart to have been made by a person 's fingers , slightly spread . " I believe you 're right , " he said . " It looks as though someone had pressed against the wall , so , and smeared the blood downward from left to right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left side . Do we know which hand the murderer used to stab her ? " " His right , " said MacGregor . " So he was right-handed , and more likely to have had blood on his right hand than his left ? " " I 'd say so , yes . " " Then most likely he made the smears with a motion of his right hand from left to right . " Julian frowned thoughtfully . " You know , there are some problems with this notion that the murderer killed the girl here by the wall . This is the most conspicuous place in the room . " He pointed out the window to where the new wing branched  | off from the main house . " Anyone looking out of a window along that side of the new wing would have a direct line of sight through my window to this very spot . Even with the trees obscuring the view , it would have been risky to kill the girl here . " " Maybe the murderer had the curtains drawn , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have been thinking clearly ! He might have been in a rage or a panic and not stopped to work out the geometry of who could see what from what angle . " " That 's certainly possible , " said Julian , so mildly that the doctor was a little ashamed of his belligerence . " Hm  --  well  --  any other objections ? " MacGregor asked . " Something more in the nature of a question . If I were to hold a woman against a wall and stab her in the back  --  something it 's never even remotely occurred to me to do , " he added , seeing Sir Robert and MacGregor look at him narrowly , " ? but if I did , she would most likely slump to the ground , and I should reach out to catch her . Or I might conceivably stand back and let her fall in a heap at my feet  --  but , either way , I would n't have any reason to smear blood on the wall with my hand . " " Dash it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make everything three times more complicated . I do n't know the answer to that riddle . Maybe the murderer was in shock or lost his balance after he killed her , and had to lean on the wall for support . " " I suppose he could have caught the girl 's body with one arm , and propped himself against the wall with his other hand , " Julian mused . " Although you would n't think he 'd put his hand up so high as those top three stains . Of course , he may have been very tall . " Julian could not help glancing at Sir Robert , who , like all the Fontclairs , was of a lofty height . " He did move his hand farther down afterward . That would account for the lighter stains below and to the right . He 'd rubbed off a good part of the blood on the first three smears by then . " " Gentlemen , " said Sir Robert , " do n't you think we 've strayed from our principal task ? Exactly where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the murderer leaned against the wall afterward ,  | do n't bring us any closer to discovering who killed the girl , or how he 's to be found . " " At this stage , do we really know what might turn out to be important ? " said Julian . " We 're surrounded by scraps of information that do n't appear to make sense . The bloodstains on the wall , the fact that the girl was tucked under the bedclothes after she was killed , the door locked from the outside , the girl 's presence in the house to begin with  --  there must be an explanation for every one of those things , and if we knew it , the murderer 's identity might fall into place as a matter of course . It reminds me of the lines of Pope I heard you reading to Lady Fontclair  --  something about all discord being harmony not understood . " " When Mr. Pope wrote of harmony , " Sir Robert said sternly , " he meant the inscrutable pattern of God 's work upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that pattern . Every one of these effects must have a cause , and if we could guess the cause ? " " I understand your point , Mr. Kestrel . Thank you . Now I think we should return to the servants ' hall and see how Senderby is progressing . Also , Travis must have finished searching the house by now , and he may have found some indication of how the girl and her murderer got in . " " What 's to be done with the body ? " MacGregor asked . " The mortician will have to come from Alderton and collect it . If no family or friends of the girl can be found , I shall take responsibility for her funeral myself . But first , I 'm afraid I shall have to ask everyone in the house to look at her . I wish I could spare them that ordeal . But since no one appears to recognize her by a spoken description , we have no choice but to ask the household to view her in the flesh . " " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the silver scallop shell . " If it was a keepsake , something the girl especially prized , it might help to identify her . " " It would n't do any harm to take it with us and show it around , " said MacGregor . " Very well . " Sir Robert put it in his waistcoat pocket . As they were leaving , MacGregor said , " Stop a moment . If you  | do n't mind , Sir Robert , I 'll answer one of Kestrel 's swarm of questions before we go . " He went to the bed and reached under the covers . After feeling about for a moment , he drew out a tiny hand , the flesh blanched almost white . He examined the hand briefly , then laid it under the sheet again . " No sign she ever wore a wedding ring . " He closed the bedcurtains , and the four men silently left the room . Out in the corridor , Julian looked at the floor and frowned . " What is it now ? " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . But I suppose the carpet in my room would pick up dirt more readily than the bare floor . So much for finding anything in the nature of a trail . " " It could also be that your servant was mistaken when he said he 'd left the windows bolted , " said Sir Robert . " If the girl and the murderer contrived to come in through the window , that would explain why they tracked dirt in your room rather than out here . " But the murderer would still have had to get out through the house , thought Julian , in order to leave the windows bolted behind him and the door locked from the outside . A fact that Sir Robert is clearly reluctant to face . They went downstairs . From the dining room , they caught the scent of food and heard the clatter of plate . Julian thought he recognized Lady Fontclair 's musical voice , but no one else seemed to be talking very much . Apparently the Fontclairs and Craddocks had little to say  --  at any rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad they 've finally been able to dine , " said Sir Robert . Julian flicked open his watch . It was just before nine o'clock ? three hours , almost to the minute , since he found the girl 's body . He was not sure if time had seemed to pass quickly or slowly since then . This night was like a dream , impossible to measure in hours and minutes . Events moved along inexorably , to some strange , solemn rhythm of their own . " I need hardly tell you gentlemen how much I appreciate your help , " Sir Robert was saying . " Your part in this unpleasant episode should come to an end very shortly , except to the extent you may be called upon to testify at the inquest , or at a trial . "  | Julian felt a pang of regret . Of course he had no business taking part in a murder investigation . And , God knew , it was no sort of work for a gentleman to go poking about for clues like a Bow Street Runner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sorry to give it up . Something deeper was troubling him , too . It was he who had found the girl , in his room , in his bed . He felt responsible , somehow . He kept seeing again that little childish hand being drawn out from under the bedclothes  --  the hand that had not worn a wedding ring , and never would now .  | As Sir Robert and his companions were crossing the screens passage into the servants ' wing , they met Travis coming in through the front door with a lantern in his hand . His coat and cap were lightly spattered with rain . " What news ? " asked Sir Robert . " Have you searched the house and grounds ? " " Yes , sir . But nary a thing did I find . " " No sign that any stranger broke into the house ? " " No , sir . I looked all over the house , and I made a circuit round the outside , but there was no sign that anybody 'd come in on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those had n't been forced . Some were open , but I do n't think anybody got in that way . The rain was only just starting , and the ground was soft . There would have been footprints , and the flowers would have been trampled , if anybody 'd tried to climb in through the windows . " " And that was true of Mr. Kestrel 's window , as well as the others ? " " Yes , sir . " " You 've done very well , " said Sir Robert . But he did not look pleased . " How many doors give access to the house from outside ? " asked Julian . " Not many , for a house this size , " said Sir Robert . " There 's the pI10 front door . " He gestured toward it , down the hallway . " There 's the back door in the servants ' wing , which leads into a small waiting room for tradesmen and others who come on business . And there are the French windows in the conservatory . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the garden and the park . " " If nobody climbed in or out of the windows , " said MacGregor , " that means anyone escaping from the house from ? let 's say , half past four up to this moment now ? had to have used one of those three doors . " " No one escaped through the conservatory windows before six o'clock , " Sir Robert said . " Lady Fontclair and I were in the conservatory from about four o'clock until six , when I left with Mr. Kestrel . I do n't know how long Lady Fontclair remained . " " You bolted the French windows just before we left , " said Julian . " Do you remember ? The wind had blown them open . " He asked Travis , " Did you notice whether they were still bolted ? " " They were , sir . " " Then it 's not likely anyone escaped from the house that way after six o'clock , because he would have had to leave the windows unbolted behind him . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir Robert , " Did Lady Fontclair and you leave the conservatory , even for a short time , at any point between four and six o'clock ? " Sir Robert opened his mouth to answer  --  then paused . " I was gone for perhaps ten minutes , " he said slowly . " A quarter of an hour , at most . I 'd been reading aloud , and Lady Fontclair had a fancy to hear Pope . I went to the library to get a book of his verses . " " Was Lady Fontclair in the conservatory all the time you were gone ? " " I have no idea , Mr. Kestrel , " Sir Robert said coldly . " Naturally it did n't occur to me to ask her . " " So now we 're left with the front door and the back door , " said MacGregor . " With respect , sir , " Travis said , " I do n't think anybody could have got in or out through the front door , either . " " Why is that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir , from half past four on . It 's kept barred while the servants are at dinner , just as it is at night . " " Do we know for certain that the door was barred on this particular afternoon ? " Sir Robert asked . " I asked Michael , sir . " Michael was one of the footmen . " He said he barred the door at half past four , as he always does . " " But he would have unbarred it , surely , when the servants finished dinner , " Sir Robert said . " Yes , sir , he did , about a quarter to six . But he says he sat here by the door after that , so he could open it for people as they came home to dinner . I found him here with Peter " ? Peter was another footman ? " when I was calling all the staff into the servants ' hall on your orders , at about half past six . I think they 'd been having a game of dice , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't catch them at it . I sent them into the servants ' hall , and then I barred the front door myself . I thought it best , seeing that something was amiss in the house . It 's been barred ever since , except just now when I was out in front of the house , and then I had it under my eye the whole time . " " Which means , " said Julian , " that from half past four on , the front door was either barred or attended by a footman . " " Yes , sir . " " So that no one can have got out that way , either , without our knowing about it . " " That 's right , sir . Because he 'd have had to leave the door unbarred after him . " Travis glanced uneasily at Sir Robert . It seemed that Mr. Kestrel 's questions were anything but welcome to him . Travis set his jaw tightly and compressed his lips . Julian knew he would get nothing more out of him without a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's already told us is disturbing enough . If the murderer was a robber who broke in with the girl , he must have got out again after he killed her . It seems he ca n't have used the front door , the conservatory doors , or any of the windows . That leaves only the back door , and to get froth my room to the back door , he would have had to pass through the servants ' hall . Could he possibly have done that without being seen ? Because if he could n't , there wo n't be any other means he could have used  | to escape from the house . And at that point , we shall have to conclude that there was no mysterious stranger  --  that the murderer is one of the servants , or one of us . Sir Robert sent Travis to fetch Senderby from the servants ' hall . When the constable arrived , Sir Robert asked him what he had learned of the servants ' whereabouts and activities between half past four and six . Senderby 's notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not his strong suit  --  but the gist of them was that each of the staff could give a reliable account of where he had been and what he had been doing during the crucial time . Rawlinson , Mrs. Cox , and Travis had been dining in their private room . The rest of the servants had been at dinner in the servants ' hall , except a couple of stablelads who had been looking after the horses . Everyone had at least one person who could vouch for his or her whereabouts between half past four and six . Sir Robert was looking more grim every moment , and Julian thought he knew why . With the servants cleared of complicity in the murder , and the chances of an unknown intruder becoming more and more remote , it was as though a web of accusation were being woven round Sir Robert 's own family . Every new piece of information he gathered was one more silken thread . But there was a complication . Julian felt a most unpleasant jolt on hearing Senderby say , " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for more than a minute or two is Mr. Kestrel 's man , who went for a walk outdoors just before half past four . " " Yes , I remember , " said Sir Robert . " When does he say he re-turned ? " Senderby floundered through his notes . " He did n't recall , sir , but the maid , Molly Dale , she knew . Said he gave her a start by popping into the servants ' hall , suddenlike , and she gave him a bit of a scold for being late to dinner . She looked at the clock , to see just how late he was , and it was ten minutes to five . " " So he was out walking alone for twenty minutes , " said Sir Robert thoughtfully . Julian felt a prickle of warning up and down his spine . Confound Dipper ! he thought . A Cockney born and bred , a child of the London streets , and this one afternoon he must needs have a craving for fresh  | air and flowers ! But what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to suspect him . It 's true he was the last person in my room before the body was found , but he had every right and reason to be there at that hour . They went into the servants ' hall . Most of them were still gathered around the long table . Sir Robert began by showing them the silver scallop shell and asking if they had seen it before . They passed it from hand to hand , looking at it curiously , but no one knew anything about it . Sir Robert next asked if any stranger could have passed from the main house through the servants ' hall to the back door at any time after half past four . The servants were positive on this point . The servants ' hall had been full of people all that time . No stranger could have come through there without being seen . " I wish to pose some questions to Michael , " Sir Robert said . All eyes turned to a tall blond footman , with a round face and fair , freckled skin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Michael confirmed that he had kept the front door barred from half past four until a quarter to six . " I unbarred it about twenty minutes past five , " he recalled , " just long enough to let in Mr. Craddock . He 'd been out riding , and he rang while we was at dinner . Then I looked at the hall clock and , seeing as it was early yet , I barred the door again . " At a quarter to six , Miss Pritchard , Miss Craddock , and the Misses Fontclair came home from their outing . Michael unbarred the front door to let them in . " Then Peter and me , we sat by the door to-gether  --  talking , " he finished hastily . " Playing at dice , more likely , " muttered Travis . Michael coloured . " Well , anyway , sir , about six o'clock I let in Master Hugh and Mr. Kestrel , and after that Colonel Fontclair . And then Mr. Travis came and told us we was wanted in the servants ' hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was shaking his head . He can see it , too , thought Julian  --  the web that 's tightening round the Fontclairs . Round Crad- ' dock , too : he returned to Bellegarde early enough to have killed the girl , though Miss Craddock did n't  --  not that I could have suspected her in any case . But it 's devilish hard to imagine any of the others  | committing this crime , either . Why should they have done it ? And why in my room ? And why ? oh , a thousand other questions . But I do n't think Sir Robert has any choice now six this afternoon . " When did Colonel Fontclair come home ? " Sir Robert asked Michael . " I do n't rightly remember , sir . I s'pose he was gone about an hour , all told . " " How do you know when he left ? " He come in here , sir , while we was at dinner , wanting to know if there was anybody in the stable who could saddle his horse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all in a taking . " " What makes you say that he was in a taking ? " asked Sir Robert sharply . " Well , he ? he looked flustered , sir , " Michael faltered . " He was in a hurry and did n't stop to say good evening or ask after people 's health , like he usually does . And when we told him there was a couple of lads out in the stable who could saddle his horse , he went out like the devil was after ? I mean , like he was in a hurry to be gone . " There were nods from the other servants . Sir Robert had grown very pale . He stood motionless , save for the quick rise and fall of his chest . Somehow he kept his voice quite level . " You understand , all of you , that we need to obtain information on even the most trivial points . Does any of you remember precisely when Colonel Fontclair left to go riding ? " The servants consulted with each other and agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten minutes after . It was certainly no earlier than five . Sir Robert was white and still as a statue . Into this painful silence came a high , clear voice . It was Molly Dale , the pretty mobcapped maidservant . " What I do n't understand , Mr. Dipper , is how you got back in the house ? " Dipper stared , wet his lips , and did not answer . " What do you mean by that question ? " asked Sir Robert . pI15 " Well , seeing that the front door was barred , sir , all the time we was at dinner , I just wondered how Mr. Dipper got back in from his walk outside . " She gazed at Dipper , perplexed , her head tipped to one side like a bird 's . Mrs. Cox shook a finger at her . " Have n't you been told often enough not to meddle in matters that are none of your concern ? " " Thank you , Mrs. Cox , " said Sir Robert , " but I wish to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Dipper did n't come in through the back door ? " Dipper was staring at the table before him , as though memorizing every crack in the wood . Molly caught her lower lip between her teeth , and her eyes grew wide with distress . " I am waiting for an answer , Molly , " said Sir Robert . " I ? I do n't know what to answer , sir ! Am I getting Mr. Dipper in trouble somehow ? " " Listen to me very carefully , Molly . When you speak to me now , you are not merely addressing the master of this house , but a magistrate engaged in the enforcement of His Majesty 's laws . You are bound to answer truthfully and completely any question I put to you . " " Y ? yes , sir . " " Now I ask you again : How do you know that Mr. Dipper did n't enter the house through the back door in the servants ' wing ? " " Well , because I saw him , sir . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a large walnut cabinet next to the door leading into the screens passage . " I 'd got up from the table to get a cloth , because Peter knocked over his ale and it spilled all over the floor underneath my chair , and all at once Mr. Dipper popped in through that door and said he was sorry to be so late to dinner . And he gave me a fright , because I did n't hear him come in , and I jumped up in the air and said , ' Lord , Mr. Dipper , you should be ashamed of yourself , to scare a girl so . ' And then I teased him a bit for being late to dinner . So I know he came in from the main house . And that 's all I can remember , sir , honestly it is . " " You 've done very well . Thank you . " The blood was flowing back into Sir Robert 's cheeks , and his voice rang out clear and strong .  | " Dipper , you 've presented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a walk shortly before half past four . Molly says you came in to dinner from the main house some twenty minutes later . I should like you to explain how you got back into the main house from outside . We know you can not have used the front door , which was barred , or the conservatory windows , since Lady Fontclair and I would have seen you . " Dipper rose , and dragged up his eyes to meet Sir Robert 's . " I did n't go out for a walk , sir . " The other servants stared at him , holding their breath . " Then where did you go when you left Mr. Kestrel 's room this afternoon ? " Dipper threw one remorseful look at his master , then burst out , " I went downstairs to the room where all the guns and knives is kept ! " The servants stared , gasped , whispered , nudged each other . " Take him to my office for questioning , " Sir Robert ordered Senderby briskly . " Rawlinson , you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be present if you wish , seeing that he 's your servant . " Senderby edged nervously toward Dipper . In height and build he all but dwarfed the lithe little valet ; it was like watching a lion creep up fearfully on a mouse . But how could Senderby be sure what Dipper might be capable of ? He had never had to deal with a murderer before . But Dipper went with him meekly . Sir Robert said he would follow as soon as he had had a word with Travis and Mrs. Cox . MacGregor wondered what he ought to do now . He could stay here and help quell the commotion among the servants . He could join the Fontclairs and Craddocks for whatever was left of dinner . Or he could go along to Sir Robert 's office and hear what Kestrel 's man had to say for himself . As he stood debating , he felt a hand clasp his arm . He turned and confronted a pair of wild , earnest eyes he hardly recognized as Kestrel 's . " He did n't do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not have done it ! I know him . " MacGregor reminded himself that he had never trusted Julian Kestrel . He had less cause to trust him than ever , now that his  | servant had been proved a liar , and might turn out a murderer besides . But MacGregor 's trust in people sprang from instinct , not reason , and his instincts about Kestrel were muddled just now . All he knew for certain was that he could not look into those eyes and tell the fellow to go about his business . He said , " If he 's innocent , Sir Robert will tumble to it quickly enough . " " Why should he , when he has every reason to find him guilty ? " " See here , Sir Robert 's an honest man and a magistrate ! You ca n't think for a moment he 'd charge a man with murder unless he had just cause ? " " I do n't know what ' just cause ' means . I only know that if Dipper is cleared of suspicion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the murderer among his own family . How in the name of heaven can he hope to be objective ? Think what a convenient culprit Dipper would make  --  a Londoner , an outsider , a servant , but not one of the Fontclairs ' own . Sir Robert has only to bind him over for trial and close the investigation , with no more enquiry into who else might have committed the crime ! " " I 've known Sir Robert for years  --  as many years as you 've been alive , most likely  --  and I tell you , he 's as honourable a man as ever drew breath . He 'll give your servant a chance to explain himself , and if there 's not enough evidence to hold him , he 'll set him free and go on with the investigation , no matter what the cost to his family . That 's the kind of man he is . " " I hope to God you 're right . " MacGregor watched him walk distractedly about , and suddenly grinned . " I 'm glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something . I 'd begun to think you were nothing more than a fashion plate out of some London magazine . " Sir Robert called , " Are you coming , Mr. Kestrel ? " " Are you coming ? " Julian asked MacGregor . " I suppose I might as well , " MacGregor grumbled . " In the mood you 're in now , there 's no telling what crack-brained thing you might say , if I 'm not there to tug on the reins . " " Oh , I wo n't lose my head . I ca n't afford to . I 've got to keep my  | wits about me , and my temper in check , or I 'll be no use to Dipper at all . " His face relaxed into a smile . " You 'd hardly credit that in London I 'm renowned for my sangfroid . " " I 'm not sure I do n't like you better without it . But you 're right  --  if ever you needed a cool head , you need it now . "  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one on his desk , and the other on the writing table in the corner where Rawlinson was taking notes . Sir Robert sat at his desk and looked across at Dipper , who stood in the centre of the room . Julian placed his chair strategically beside them , where he could watch them both . MacGregor paced the room , his shadow flitting in his wake . Outdoors , the wind was blowing fiercely , driving pellets of rain against the windowpanes . Sir Robert said to Dipper , " I have a duty to advise you at the outset that you are not required to answer my questions . I can not compel you to give information against yourself . I strongly suggest , however , that , if you have information that may excuse or explain your conduct , you present it now . Otherwise , I shall be forced to draw highly damaging inferences against you . Do you understand ? " " I think so , sir . " " What is your full name ? " " Thomas Stokes , sir . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were called Dipper . " " Dipper 's a nickname , sir . " " Did you know Dipper was n't his real name ? " Sir Robert asked Julian . The nickname , as Julian well knew , had been given to Dipper  | on account of his dexterity at dipping his hand into other people 's pockets . " He told me his real name when I engaged him . But he said he was accustomed to be called Dipper , and as I thought it suited him , I 've kept it up . " He added , very deliberately , " I have n't the remotest idea what it means . " Dipper 's jaw dropped , and he started to shake his head in protest . Julian 's eyes shot him a warning : Do n't be an ass . I 've lied for you , and I 'm going to go on lying . If you try to stop me now , you 'll only dish us both . " What does it mean ? " Sir Robert asked Dipper . " I du n @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I was a kid . " " How old are you now ? " " I 'm twenty , sir . " " How long have you been in Mr. Kestrel 's employ ? " " I think it 's been about two years , sir . " Sir Robert turned to Julian . " You engaged him as your valet when he was only eighteen ? Had he any previous experience ? " " Not a whit . He was a complete tabula rasa . I was able to train him exactly as I liked . " " What were you doing before Mr. Kestrel engaged you ? " " I did n't have no reg'lar work , sir . " " How did you support yourself ? " " Not very well , sir . " " Have you any family ? " " No , sir . That is , me parents is dead , and I du n no what 's got me brother and sister . " " How did you come to be employed by Mr. Kestrel ? " Dipper hung fire for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his watch , sir . I give it back to him . " MacGregor thought : Of all the deuced funny ways to go about engaging a manservant ! Especially for a fellow who cares as much about his clothes as Kestrel seems to . Dash it , the man gets more puzzling every minute . " Let 's proceed to the events of this afternoon , " said Sir Robert . " Do you still claim you were in Mr. Kestrel 's room until shortly before half past four ? " " Yes , sir . "  | " Were you alone there all that time ? " " Yes , sir . " " I have asked you this already , but as you lied to us before , I 'm obliged to repeat my earlier questions . I hope you mean to answer truthfully this time ? " " Yes , sir . But , sir , I did n't wrinkle about nothing except going for a walk outside . " " I shall get to that presently . Did you at any time today see a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow dress ? " " No , sir . " " Are you acquainted with anyone who fits that description ? " " Not so as I can recall , sir . " " Have you ever been in trouble with the law in the past , Stokes ? " Dipper wet his lips . " No , sir . " " When I asked you earlier what you did on leaving your master 's room , why did you say you went for a walk outside ? " " I did n't take it , sir ! " Dipper burst out . " Take what ? " " I du n no , sir . Whatever it is that 's been pinched . I did n't take it , I swear ! " " Nothing has been stolen that we know of . Someone has been murdered . " " My Gawd ! " Dipper looked at Julian . " Do they think I done it , sir ? " " You 've confused matters a bit by telling us you went out for a constitutional at a time when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapons . " " Oh , sir , I did n't  --  I would n't  --  you got to believe me , I would n't do nothing like that ! " " Why did you tell us you went outside when you were really in the gun room ? " asked Julian quietly . " I was afraid , sir . I knew I had n't any business in there , but I wanted to see it . You was telling me about it last night , sir , remember ? ? how there was all kinds of barking-irons there , and maps , and flags , and bits of metal as knights used to put on their horses . I got a hankering to see it meself , and when I found I had  | a little time before dinner , I piked downstairs and had a peery . And it was the lummiest place , sir  --  I never seen nothing like it . I was so took up with looking at everything , I forgot about dinner , till I snilched the clock and saw how late it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall . " " See here , lad , " said MacGregor , " this wo n't do at all . If you were n't up to any mischief in the gun room , why did n't you own up you were there ? You could n't have thought you 'd get into any serious trouble , just for going in and having a look round . " " It was n't so much that , sir . I took fright when I saw we was being questioned by a nabsman  --  a constable , I mean . I thought something must 've got lifted , and I did n't want to get mixed up in it . I thought if I said I was in the gun room , everybody 'd be down upon me about why I was there , and it just seemed safest to say I was out of the house . I did n't know about the front door being barred , and that . I just did n't think at all . " He looked at Julian . " I 'm sorry , sir . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair to warn you , Stokes , you 're in a very grave position . When questioned by a magistrate , you told a lie , and apparently you would have persisted in it , if Molly had n't spoken . I have no way of knowing what else you may have said that is not the truth . You admit to being the last person in Mr. Kestrel 's room before the body was found there . And you admit that , at about the time when the victim must have been stabbed to death , you went secretly to a room where knives are kept ready to hand . " " The body was found in me master 's room , sir ? " " Yes . " " Well , sir , if there 's one thing I 'd never do , it 's clip some cove 's wick and leave him laid out stiff in me master 's room ! And get me master in trouble like that ? Not likely , sir ! " " The victim was not a man , " said Sir Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you earlier . " " What  --  you mean the mort with the red hair and the yellow dress ? Who is she , sir ? " " We have n't identified her yet . I will , however , give you another chance to do so , if you can . "  | " I 'd like to help you , sir , but I du n no who she is . " " Very well . Senderby , see if he 's carrying a weapon , or any property that might have been stolen . " Dipper stood up . Julian wished he would not look quite so much as though he were used to being searched . Senderly felt inside his coat and turned out his pockets . All he found was a handful of coins , a penknife , a handkerchief , a small clothesbrush , a needle and thread , a paper of pins , and some sugar candy . " What room in the house have you been given ? " Sir Robert asked Dipper . " I 'm sharing with the footmen , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to search Dipper 's room . For the time being , Dipper was to be kept locked in Rawlinson 's office , which was down the hall from Sir Robert 's . " Is that really necessary ? " asked Julian . " He 's implicated in a felony , " said Sir Robert . " He must be kept under lock and key until I determine whether there 's sufficient cause for an arrest . Rawlinson , be good enough to show Senderby where your office is . Then tell Travis to look in the gun room and find out if any knives are missing or show signs of recent use . " Rawlinson and Senderby went out , with Dipper between them . Dipper threw Julian a last remorseful look . Julian winked at him . Dipper broke into a grin , and winked back . " Well , Mr. Kestrel , " said Sir Robert , " have you anything to say in your servant 's defence ? " " I do n't defend his lack of candour . He ought to have told the truth . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed anyone . He only lied to divert attention from himself , because he was panicked at the very idea of being questioned by a constable . To people of Dipper 's class in London , a constable can seem a very formidable beast . A costermonger or a crossing-sweeper does n't readily think of the law as his friend . " " Nor should he , " said Sir Robert . " The law is impartial . It is no one 's friend , and everyone 's . " " Well , be that as it may , there 's a tendency among Dipper 's sort of people to keep out of the clutches of the law , either for good or ill. "  | " What do you know about his life before you engaged him ? He seems to use many of the cant expressions of thieves . " " I believe that 's not uncommon in the East End . For that matter , it 's not uncommon among young bloods in the best families . In that respect , Dipper may be getting above his station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I think a good part of what the boy said may be moonshine , but there 's one thing I believed . When he swore he 'd never have gotten his master in trouble by leaving a body in his room , that seemed to come straight from the heart . " " Has he ever shown signs of nervous instability or a violent tem-per ? " Sir Robert asked Julian . " Pardon me , Sir Robert , I do n't mean to laugh , but when I recollect we 're talking about Dipper ? ! Sir Robert , he has the softest heart in Christendom . He ca n't even kill spiders . He gathers them up and ushers them out the window as though they were royalty . Perhaps he has it in him to commit a murder  --  perhaps we all do , under some set of circumstances or other  --  but in Dipper 's case it would not  --  could not  --  be this particular murder . To kill a young woman in cold blood , and then tuck her into bed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  no , Sir Robert , I 'd stake my life on it : He is n't capable of that . " " Can I ask you a frank question , Kestrel ? " " I 've never known you to hesitate in the past , Doctor , and I should n't wish you to . " " Here it is , then . Your man seems very loyal to you , and if you 've really done as much for him as he says , he 's got reason to be . " " What I 've done for him is to pay him very inadequately to wait on me hand and foot at any hour of the day or night . " " Rubbish ! I can read between the lines of what he said . He was living hand-to-mouth in London , and you took it into your head to engage him as your manservant , even though he talks as if he came out of a flash house , and he ca n't have known the first thing about getting up shirt frills , or whatever he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say I 've got it about right , or you would n't be looking out of the window instead of at me . He 's loyal to you , and he 's right to be . But my question is , how far would he go to do you a service ? Has he got it  | in him to put a person out of the way , if he thought you needed it badly enough ? " " I do n't know . I know he 's devilish efficient and clever , and if he did decide to commit a murder for my sake , I 'd like to think he 'd make a neater job of it than this . But I find it very hard to believe he could stab a woman in the back for any reason . Besides , how could he do me any good by killing a woman I 've never met and do n't know from Eve ? " " We 've got to identify that girl , " said Sir Robert . " The whole investigation hinges on that . Only when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had a reason to kill her . " Julian drew breath and plunged . " Are you going to finish questioning everyone in the house ? " " I thought I had finished , Mr. Kestrel . " " You have n't accounted for the whereabouts of some of your family and Mr. Craddock at the time of the murder . " " Do you mean to say you wish me to treat my family and guests as though they were under suspicion ? " " I am one of your guests , Sir Robert , and I 've been under suspicion ever since the murder was discovered . Believe me , it has n't been a pleasant experience . I can understand your reluctance to put your family through it . But how can the murder be thoroughly and fairly investigated , unless everyone in the house , however seemingly above suspicion , is questioned about what he or she was doing when the girl was killed ? " " You can not mean you would have even my wife  --  my sister ? questioned about this crime ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quietly . " It is no one 's friend , and everyone 's . " Sir Robert drew a long breath . " So be it , Mr. Kestrel . If you 'll come with me , gentlemen , we will ask each of my family and Mr. Craddock where they were and what they were doing between half past four and twenty minutes to six . "  | Before going to the drawing room to question his family , Sir Robert finally told the servants about the murder . By this time , they were so worn out with speculation that the news came as more of a relief than anything else . On hearing that Mr. Kestrel 's valet was being held for further questioning , they assured each other they had always known Dipper was a bad lot . He had a wicked look about him ; anyone could see it . Only think of it , " said Dorcas to Molly Dale , " he sat by you all evening , and you not knowing he had blood on his hands ! " But Molly was crying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspecting the gun room , and reported to Sir Robert that no knives were missing or showed signs of recent use . Julian was relieved , since any suggestion that the murder weapon came ' from the gun room would make things worse for Dipper . Unfortunately , the lack of such evidence did not establish anything much in Dipper 's favour . Proving innocence , Julian realized , is apt to be much more difficult than proving guilt . Sir Robert told Travis to have the girl 's body brought downstairs to a small study , where the servants could file in one by one and look at her . Travis and Mrs. Cox were to supervise the viewing , and report to Sir Robert if anyone recognized the girl . Julian 's room  | would be kept locked until tomorrow , when a more thorough search could be conducted by the morning light . Julian was , of course , obliged to move into another room . He asked Sir Robert if he might have the vacant guest room next door to his old room . Sir Robert agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " MacGregor wanted to know . " I wish I 'd progressed so far as to be up to something . I just have a presentiment about that part of the house . I think that , if we understood the ' where ' of this crime , we might understand the ' who ' and the ' why ' as well . " " Do you mean to say you expect us to make a statement about what we were doing at the time of the murder ? And that man is going to write it down ? " Lady Tarleton pointed an elegantly gloved finger at Rawlinson . He ducked his head and pretended to be busy with his notes . " I am taking statements from everyone who was at or near Bellegarde at the time the girl was killed , " said Sir Robert . " In the case of all of you , of course , I look upon this as a formality . But if I refrained from questioning any of you , out of respect for your birth or position or character , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dishonourable motives . Surely you would n't wish to have it said that I feared to ask my own relations the same questions I put to the servants about where they went and what they did this afternoon ? " " But there 's no reason we should be demeaned in this way , " argued Lady Tarleton , " when it 's perfectly obvious who killed the girl . That creature Mr. Kestrel brought among us must have done it . Otherwise , why did he go to the gun room , and why did he lie about it afterward ? " " I grant you , a number of suspicious circumstances seem to point to Mr. Kestrel 's servant . But until we have more positive proof , the investigation must continue . However distasteful the task , I must ask each of you to account for your whereabouts between half past four and twenty minutes to six this afternoon . I put it to you plainly :  | Unless you have the goodness to answer my questions , I shall have no choice but to turn over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impartiality is not open to doubt . " None of the Fontclairs wanted that  --  Julian could tell by the troubled silence that followed Sir Robert 's words . Were they afraid an outsider might stumble on the secret that Craddock was holding over their heads ? Or did they have an even more sinister reason to shrink from a full and fair investigation of the murder ? Hugh stood up . " If you 'll permit me , sir , I should like to be the first to make a statement . " His mother smiled warmly at him . Sir Robert 's smile was more restrained , but his eyes shone with pride and approval . " Please proceed . " " Well , there 's not much to say , really . Mr. Kestrel and I went riding at  --  oh , it must have been about half past three . I showed him the park and the model farms . We did n't come back to the house until about five or ten minutes to six . Should I go any further ? " " Why do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Mr. Kestrel discovered the murder ? First tell me : Were you and Mr. Kestrel together all the time you were out riding ? " " Yes . Yes , I 'm sure we were . " " Did you see any strangers , or anything out of the common , anywhere near Bellegarde ? " " No , sir . " " And what happened when you returned ? " " Michael let us in , and we went into the great hall . Then we said something civil to each other about having enjoyed ourselves rid-ing  --  that sort of thing  --  and Mr. Kestrel went upstairs . I stayed in the hall , and after a bit Miss Craddock came down and asked ? " Oh , the deuce ! he thought . I do n't want to say she was asking after Kestrel . It will sound awfully funny , and it might put her in an awkward spot , what with the murder happening in Kestrel 's room . " She asked if we 'd had a good ride , " he finished lamely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that she was looking for Mr. Kestrel ? Did he think her forward for seeking out Mr. Kestrel that way ? If he did , he was really being very unfair !  | What other friend did she have at Bellegarde ? He had certainly never taken her into his confidence , or asked to be taken into hers . She realized Sir Robert was speaking to her . " Miss Craddock , would you be good enough to continue ? " She stood up shakily , conscious of her father 's hard , intent gaze on her . She felt as though she were standing in a hot , bright light . In a voice so low that Sir Robert had to ask her several times to speak up , she described her outing with Miss Pritchard and the girls . " We came home at about a quarter to six . And I ? I went to my room to dress for dinner . " " How did you happen to come downstairs again some ten or fifteen minutes later , when my son spoke with you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parasol in the great hall . I had n't . It was a silly mistake . I had it in my room the whole time . " Maud thought : Now I 've lied to satisfy Papa , and I 've lied so as not to contradict Hugh . And why I should do such a wrong thing for either of their sakes is more than I can say . Hugh thought : Look how readily she took me up when I gave her a chance to conceal she was looking for Kestrel . If there were nothing hole-in-corner about her feelings for him , would n't she come right out and admit she asked me where he was ? Julian thought : Damnation . This is exasperating . Each of these infernal innocents is holding something back , and there 's no telling whether it has anything to do with the murder , or whether it 's merely some romantic muddle of their own . " Shall I speak next ? " said Lady Fontclair . She smiled at Sir Robert , her wide dark eyes looking confidently into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I was in the conservatory . I was tending to the plants , and sewing , and listening to you read aloud . I did n't see any strangers , or anything unusual . " " At one point , " Sir Robert prompted , " I left the room . " Her eyes strayed for the first time . " Yes . Yes , that 's true . I think you went to the library to get a book  --  Pope 's verses . A few minutes later , Isabelle came in from the terrace . That was at twenty minutes past five  --  I remember , because she asked what time it was . You came back some five or ten minutes after that . You ca n't have been gone above a quarter of an hour , all told . "  | " Thank you , my dear . Isabelle , will you continue ? " Isabelle came gracefully to her feet . " I went out to my favourite seat in the rose arbour this afternoon . I do n't remember precisely when I left , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I brought my sketchbook and sketching box , so that I could design a pattern for Miss Craddock 's wedding slippers . I 'm to embroider them for her , as a wedding gift . When I finished , I thought it must be nearly time to dress for dinner , so I came in through the conservatory windows . Aunt Cecily was there . I asked what time it was , and she said it was twenty minutes past five . I said thank you and went upstairs . " When I got upstairs , I thought I would go and look for Miss Craddock , so I could show her my design and see if she approved of it . I went to her room and knocked on the door , but she was n't there . So I went to my own room and worked for a while on some other sketches . Then I rang for my maid and dressed for dinner . " Julian said , " Miss Fontclair , if you walked from the first floor of the new wing to Miss Craddock 's room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross the corridor that leads to my room . " " I did n't cross it , precisely . I went down it a little way and then turned left into the corridor where Miss Craddock 's room is . " Julian mentally retraced her steps . His room was at the end of a corridor . She would have come down that corridor from the opposite end , and at the point when she turned left , his room would have been only a few doors ahead . Was it too much to hope that she might have seen or heard something before she made that turn ? Of course , by the time she came home at twenty minutes past five , the murderer might long since have killed the girl and fled from that part of the house . But , still Sir Robert apparently had the same thought . " You may well have passed close to Mr. Kestrel 's room at or near the time of the murder . I do n't wish to distress you with that idea , but merely to impress on you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be of the greatest importance . " Isabelle took time to think . " I 'm afraid I did n't make any observations . I was there a very short time , and my only concern was to  | speak to Miss Craddock . Once I knew she was n't in her room , I went directly to mine . I did n't stop to look about me . Everything seemed just as usual . " " And you heard nothing out of the ordinary ? " " No , Uncle Robert , I did n't . " " If you should remember something later  --  any detail , however small , that seemed strange or out of place to you  --  will you let me know ? " " Yes . " " Geoffrey ? " Sir Robert turned to his brother . " Afraid I do n't have much of anything to say . Bit of a bore , after Isabelle . I went riding till after six , and then I dressed for dinner . That 's about all . " Sir Robert continued to gaze at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning to fidget , " what more do you want to know ? " " The servants say you did n't leave to go riding until after five o'clock . In order to obtain a complete statement , I must ask you where you were between half past four and five . " " For God 's sake , Robert ! Have we got to the point where you 're questioning the servants about me behind my back ? " " I questioned the servants about everyone 's comings and goings this afternoon . Now , if you would be so good as to complete your statement ? ? " " I was in my room ! Are you satisfied ? First I was n't doing much of anything , then I put on my riding boots . Then I went out . " " Did your manservant help you with your boots ? " " My God , do you need a witness ? He was dining . I did n't bother to ring for him . I can put on a pair of boots myself ! " He threw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't remember which foot I started with . Sorry . " Sir Robert stood very still . It took Julian a moment to realize he was trying to command his voice . At last he got out , Some of the servants thought you seemed disturbed about something when you left to go riding . " " I was n't disturbed about leaving a dead woman in Kestrel 's room . "  | " I did n't suppose you were . I 'm merely attempting to make a thorough enquiry . " " Well , I do n't have anything else to say . " " Very well . Catherine , may I trouble you to continue ? " " Oh , by all means . As long as everyone else is being put through this senseless humiliation , I must n't be behindhand in bearing my share . It 's some comfort that I can be very brief . I never left my rooms  --  my bedchamber and boudoir  --  from shortly after luncheon until I came down to dinner . My maid came to help me dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " May I ask what you were doing all that time ? " " I consider it an insult you should ask , but of course I am bound to answer . I was sewing  --  working on my embroidery . Is there anything else you wish to know ? " " That will suffice . Thank you . Guy ? " " Between about half past three and half past five , I was asleep . Then I woke up , rang for my man , and dressed for dinner . I came downstairs sometime between six and half past . " " You were asleep in your room ? " " Yes , sir . I was fagged out this afternoon . I 'd been out a good part of last night , and then I got up early this morning to go to the horse fair . I did n't have anything else to do , so I slept for a couple of hours . The col  --  my father would remember that . I saw him just before I went up to my room . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to play a rubber of piquet , and he said he was sleepy and was just on his way upstairs to have a nap . " " When was that ? " asked Sir Robert . " I do n't remember exactly , " said Geoffrey . " It was just before I went up to my room , " said Guy . " Half past three . " " And where did this conversation take place ? " " I found Guy in the library , " said Geoffrey . " He left , and I stayed . " " Did the two of you see one another again before dinnertime ? " " We could n't very well have , " said Geoffrey . " I told you , Uncle , I was asleep , " said Guy .  | " Mr. Craddock , you appear to be the only person who has not yet given a statement . If you would be so kind ? ? " " I took my horse out for exercise this afternoon . When I got back it was still a good while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four and a quarter to five . I handed over my horse to my groom and went for a walk . I came in at twenty minutes past five . I know , because I looked at my watch . I went upstairs to my room and dressed . That 's how and about it . " " Were you alone all the time you were walking ? " " Yes . " " Where did you walk ? " " In the Chase . There 's a little clearing there I had a mind to see again . " Lady Tarleton spun around to look at him , eyes blazing . He did not glance her way . Sir Robert was facing away from her and did not notice her reaction . " Did you see anyone in the Chase ? " he asked Craddock . " No . " " Michael says he let you in at the front door at about twenty minutes past five . " " That 's right . " " Did you see anyone on your way to your room ? " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of . My man came up to help me dress , but that was n't till after six . So I do n't have what the lawyers call an alibi . But then , which of us does ? "  | If you must talk in terms of alibis , " Sir Robert said coldly , " allow me to point out that Lady Fontclair was with me throughout the period in question , apart from a very brief interval when I was in the library . And my son , Mr. Kestrel , and Miss Craddock are absolved from suspicion , if Dr. MacGregor is correct that the girl was killed no later than twenty minutes to six . We know from their statements , as confirmed by Michael , that none of them returned to the house until after that time . " " If I understand Dr. MacGregor correctly , " said Lady Tarleton , " the only reason he thinks the girl was dead by twenty minutes to six is that Mr. Kestrel says she was cold when he found her . And we have only Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touched the girl and found her cold , only a matter of minutes after Mr. Kestrel discovered her , " Sir Robert pointed out . " And I had other factors in mind besides the coldness of the body when I gave an opinion about the time of death , " said MacGregor . " Based on the onset of rigor and the loss of blood , I 'd have said she was most likely killed between half past four and half past five . " Lady Tarleton tossed her head . " As long as we 're all answering questions , I should like to ask Mr. Kestrel if by any chance he chose to rid himself of some  --  creature  --  he 'd formed a connexion with ,  | by having his servant kill her in our house , so as to throw suspicion on us . " " I hope you 'll be reluctant to believe that of me , Lady Tarleton ? just as I 'm reluctant to believe that any of you could have killed the girl in my room , so as to throw suspicion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspicion , " said Sir Robert . " I can not counsel you strongly enough not to make a difficult situation worse by accusing one another . " " Robert , you 're growing hoarse , " said Lady Fontclair . " And you 've had nothing to eat , and it 's nearly midnight . Why do n't you and Dr. MacGregor and Mr. Kestrel have dinner ? We 've all finished making our statements . Surely there 's nothing more you can do about the murder tonight . " " I 'm afraid there are a few tasks left to perform . " He gave her a brief , strained smile . " One of those tasks is to ask each of you to look at this and tell me if you recognize it . " He reached into a pocket of his waistcoat , and held out his hand . The silver scallop shell glinted in the candlelight . " What is it ? " asked Hugh . " It 's an ornament that the young lady was wearing around her neck . " " How revolting ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't expect us to touch that thing ! " " All I ask is that you look at it long enough to tell me whether you 've seen it before . " Lady Fontclair held out her hand to him . " May I ? " she asked gently . He gave her the scallop shell , still strung on its blue ribbon . She looked at it closely and earnestly , then shook her head and offered it to Hugh . Sad and a little awed , he ran his eyes slowly over first one side and then the other . He passed it to Isabelle with a look of apology , as though he would have liked to spare her this ordeal . But Isabelle took it with a steady hand and looked it over as though she were being asked for an artist 's opinion of its quality . It seemed settled that the scallop shell would travel in a circle around the room . Colonel Fontclair came next . As Isabelle brought  | it to him , he shrank back a little in his chair , staring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached out slowly and took the scallop shell , looked at it , then handed it to his son . Guy gave it the briefest possible glance and practically thrust it into the face of the next person , who happened to be Maud . She gazed at it in puzzlement , then passed it to her father . Craddock gave it his narrow , flinty-eyed stare . Then he brought it to Lady Tarleton . He seemed to loom up on her as he approached , making her tall , proud figure look amazingly slight and vulnerable . " Do you want me to hold it for you , or will you take it ? " She held out her hand imperiously . He gave her the scallop shell . She turned it crisply from one side to the other . " It means nothing to me . Here , Robert . Take it back . " Sir Robert stared at her outstretched hand . Lady Fontclair and Julian , standing on either side of him , stared too . A red stain was spreading over her white glove , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thumb . When she saw it , she flung the scallop shell on a table and jerked her hand away . " My dear , you 're hurt ! " exclaimed Lady Fontclair . " It 's a trifle . I thought it would have stopped bleeding long since . I wrapped it in a piece of linen , and it seemed to do very well . " MacGregor came forward . " Let me see it . " She pressed both hands to her breast , the left clutched around the right . " It 's nothing , I tell you ! " " I 'll be the judge of that . Give it here , madam , if you please . " She made a sound between a sigh and a snort , and thrust out her right hand . MacGregor carefully removed her long glove and unwound the thin strips of linen she had wrapped around her finger . " Nothing serious , but a very ugly cut . How did you do it ? " " I cut myself on my embroidery scissors . It was when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know why it should start bleeding again after all this time . " " It started bleeding again because it did n't have a proper dressing . You ought to have gone to Lady Fontclair . She knows how to look after this kind of thing . " He dabbed the blood away with his handkerchief . Julian , stealing  | a glance over his shoulder , saw that the gash extended from the base of her forefinger to the middle joint . He tried to remember if she was right-handed . Yes : he pictured her brandishing Sir Roland Font-clair 's sword in the gun room last night . She had used her right hand , he was sure . He said , " I do n't quite understand how you cut your finger , Lady Tarleton . " " And I do n't understand why that should be any concern of yours ! " " I beg your pardon . I was just trying to picture how a righthanded person could cut the lower part of her right forefinger with a scissors . If you 'd been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside one of the holes , not near the blades . " " The effrontery of this is beyond all bearing ! How dare you question me like this ? Next you 'll be saying I cut myself while killing that wretched girl ! Anything to cover your servant 's guilt , I suppose ! And you ! " She raked the men in her family with her gaze . " You can all stand by and see this nobody  --  this social hanger-on , with his trumpery airs and graces  --  publicly cast doubt on my honour and question my word ! If you were any of you worthy of our name , you 'd demand satisfaction on my behalf ! He would have done as much ! " She flung up a yearning gaze to the portrait of Sir Roland Fontclair . There was a shocked silence . The Fontclair men looked at each other , tense and uncertain . Julian wondered if Dipper had thought to pack his duelling pistols . " See here , " said MacGregor , " nobody 's giving anybody that kind of satisfaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this business away from Sir Robert , but duelling 's a barbarous , heathen custom , and I 'm sure Sir Robert , being a magistrate , would agree with me it 's no way to settle a quarrel between honest Englishmen . The fact is , there 's nothing amiss in Kestrel 's asking how you cut your hand , Lady Tarleton . This is a murder investigation . If there 's any misunderstanding about what people were doing this afternoon , we 've got to clear it up . Anyway , I need to know just how you cut your hand , if I 'm to treat it properly . So you might as well tell us and have it over . " Sir Robert let out a long breath . Hugh and Guy dropped back  | into their chairs . Julian made a small flourish with his hand , as though taking off an imaginary hat to MacGregor . MacGregor tried , halfheartedly , to glare at him in return . " If everyone is against me , " said Lady Tarleton , " if I must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no choice but to submit . I have nothing to conceal . Though I 'm afraid what I have to say will hardly justify the trouble you 've taken to find it out . I dropped my scissors on the floor while I was working with it . It broke . I picked it up too hastily and cut my hand . It 's as simple as that . " It 's anything but simple , thought Julian . How could you pick up a broken scissors from the floor , however carelessly , so as to cut your finger all the way from the knuckle to the middle joint ? Oh , no , Lady Tarleton , that wo n't do at all . * The servants had viewed the murdered girl 's body . Sir Robert found them in a fever of excitement , their horror mixed with fascination and a sense of their own importance . Here they were at the centre of a crime that might become as famous as the Ratcliffe murders ! Most of them were full of pity for the girl , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be , but no one had the slightest idea who she was . Sir Robert had no choice but to return to the drawing room and ask the Fontclairs and Craddocks to look at the girl . They were joined by a quaking Miss Pritchard , who had put Joanna and Philippa to bed with their doors securely locked . It was agreed that Sir Robert and Lady Fontclair would break the news of the murder to them early next morning , to make sure they did not hear of it first from gossip among the servants . Meanwhile , Julian took MacGregor aside . " I want to thank you for putting a damper on what might have blown up into a very ugly quarrel between me and the Fontclairs . An affair of honour would have been deuced inconvenient just now . " " It would n't have come to that . Sir Robert 's a sensible man , at bottom . He 'd never have allowed what you young bucks are so wrongheaded as to call an affair of honour . All I did was give him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the better of his family pride . That 's the Fontclairs ' besetting sin  --  they 've all got at least a dash of it . Lady Tarleton 's the worst  --  she thinks she can ride roughshod over everything and everybody , just because she 's a Fontclair . The colonel 's too indolent , and that good-for-nothing son of his is too selfish , to give much thought to the family name . But make no mistake : If it were really threatened , they 'd defend it quick enough , and they might be much more dangerous than Lady Tarleton , because she 's got scruples of a sort , and they do n't . Sir Robert 's different  --  he really tries to do right and not put his honour above England 's law , or God 's . But it 's a struggle for him  --  he 's head of the family , and the proudest of the lot of them . You do n't know what it costs him to hear you out with patience , when you put it to him that one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murder . " " What about Miss Fontclair ? Is she as fanatically proud as the others ? " " Isabelle ? She 's a puzzle . But if I had to take a guess , I 'd say she sets as much store by the family name as Lady Tarleton . What she 's got that Lady Tarleton lacks is self-control . She 's disciplined , like Sir Robert . Whether she 's got his moral sense is something else again . " The dead girl lay face up on a divan in a small study . A quilt was wrapped around her up to her neck . In silence , the Fontclairs and Craddocks filed past her . Each of them held a candle to her face  --  looked at her  --  passed the candle to the next person  --  and withdrew into the shadows . Julian stood unobtrusively near the head of the divan , so he could watch their faces as they looked at the girl . He hoped against hope he might learn something from their reactions . For it seemed more and more likely that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Craddock , Colonel Fontclair , Guy , Isabelle  --  none of them had a complete alibi for the time of death , and their statements ranged from dubious to unbelievable . Even Sir Robert and Lady Fontclair had each been alone for a quarter of an hour between half past four  | and six  --  long enough to have stabbed the girl in Julian 's room and returned to the conservatory . He found it hard to observe this ritual with the calm , alert detachment he needed . It was all very well to conclude , as a matter of logic , that one of these people must have killed her . It was quite another thing to see them filing slowly past her , and to picture each of them driving a knife into her living flesh . But he must not let his feelings cloud his judgement . Compassion was all very well , horror was only natural , but neither would do the girl any good now . The only thing of value left to give her was justice . And that was another reason  --  as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he must do everything in his power to solve the murder . No one admitted to recognizing the girl . They got through the viewing fairly well  --  all except Guy , who stuffed his handkerchief in his mouth and ran out of the room . That might have meant something , or nothing , and the same could be said of all the suspects ' reactions . Craddock 's grimness , Lady Tarleton 's revulsion , the colo-nel 's dread  --  they could all be symptoms of guilt , or merely the natural responses of innocent people at the sight of a murder victim . Not that Julian would have described any of those three as innocent . They might not be guilty of murder , but they were each hiding something , he felt sure . And speaking of hiding something , he would have to find out what Hugh and Miss Craddock lied about when Sir Robert was questioning them . Now that they had seen the dead girl in the flesh , they might be more willing to reveal anything they knew that could throw light on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tears spilling down her cheeks . To Julian 's surprise , she avoided both Hugh and her father , although Hugh offered her his handkerchief , and Craddock tried to put his arm around her . The only person she would accept comfort from was Lady Fontclair . But she took a moment to seek out Julian and whisper , " I just wanted to tell you , I 'm sorry people are saying you had something to do with all this . I know you did n't . " Julian could only be grateful he need not count Miss Craddock among the suspects . Isabelle looked more shaken than Julian had ever seen her . After the viewing , she sat in a corner of the study , her hands clenched ,  | fighting for self-command . He went up to her and said gently , " You do n't have to stay here any longer . They 'll be coming soon to take the body away . " She drew a long breath and rose . He offered her his arm , but she shook her head . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They walked out together . After a while she said , " Do you suspect Aunt Catherine ? " " I do n't know what to think . I wish she 'd told the truth about how she cut her hand . " " Are you so confident you know when a person is telling the truth ? " " No , but sometimes it 's fairly obvious when someone is  --  mis-remembering . ' ' " I wonder you did n't notice when your servant  --  misremem-bered  --  about going for a walk outside . " " The people you trust are at a great advantage in lying to you . You do n't expect it . Which is why it 's just as well not to trust too many people . " " I suppose there 's no danger you might trust any of us . " " Can I afford to ? " She gave him one of her cool , direct gazes . " I would n't , if I were in your place . "  | It was after one o'clock in the morning when Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner . Most of the household was in bed , although a few servants remained to wait at table . Rawlinson and Senderby had ridden to Alderton to arrange for the village mortician to come to Bellegarde and collect the girl 's body . Sir Robert thought it best to send it quietly to Alderton tonight , before news of the murder created a sensation in the village . Rawlinson and Senderby also had instructions to bring back two men from the village , a carpenter and a stationer . They would be sworn in as special constables , charged with assisting Senderby in the murder investigation . It gave Senderby some satisfaction to think of waking up his neighbours in the middle of the night and pressing them into service as his deputies . All of Alderton had been so eager to force him into the office of constable ! Now he would see how some of them liked pestering people with questions and searching people 's rooms , with Sir Robert Fontclair looking over their shoulders at every turn . What remained to be decided was the fate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had turned up nothing of interest . He had been locked in Rawlinson 's office for several hours ; he could not be kept there all night . Sir Robert announced his decision to MacGregor and Julian after they had dined , and the servants had  | left them alone . " I intend to commit him to gaol  --  not the county gaol , but merely the lockup in Alderton . I do n't propose to charge him with the murder yet . I have too little evidence , particularly about the victim 's identity , to feel justified in binding him over for trial . But I have it in my power to hold him for three days , at the end of which time I shall consider releasing him , if no further evidence against him has come to light . " " Will you let me stand surety for him instead ? " asked Julian . " Only name an amount of money , and I 'll put it up . " " I 'm afraid that , where the crime is so serious , there can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " If he were to bolt , it would look like an admission of guilt . And he could n't get very far without being caught and brought back . " " You force me to be blunt , Mr. Kestrel . I can not permit you to stand surety for Stokes , because I am not completely satisfied you had nothing to do with the crime yourself . " " I see , " said Julian softly . " In that case , Sir Robert , I have another request . I should like to take part in your investigation of the murder . " " What exactly do you wish to do ? " " I wish to be kept apprised of whatever you discover , and to make enquiries myself . " " Do you doubt my ability to handle this investigation ? " " No , not at all . I just want to assist you . I 've often been told it 's every Englishman 's duty to enforce the law . That 's why we supposedly have no need of police , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a magistrate to help keep the peace . " " I have n't called upon you to help me , Mr. Kestrel . " " I have volunteered , Sir Robert . I think it 's not merely my duty , but my right . My servant stands accused of the murder , and although I do n't believe for a moment you 'll find any more evidence against him than you have now , I believe that juries , faced with especially atrocious murders , like to find someone guilty . I do n't relish the notion of Dipper 's being hanged for want of any more plausible suspect turning up . Besides , it 's been hinted , and more than hinted , that I had a hand in the murder myself . My honour is implicated . With respect , I think you can not refuse me. " 1  | " I admit , there is something in what you say . Very well . You may take part in the investigation and make enquiries yourself , provided you can do so with discretion and without giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Do n't think I 'm unaware that your primary aim will be to determine whether one of my family is guilty . That you or anyone else could think such a thing pains and affronts me more than I can say . But I recognize that the possibility must be explored , and I should rather have you explore it , informally and quietly , than invite London policemen into my house to question my family and guests . If , a week hence , we have n't come near to solving this crime , then I shall have no choice but to appeal to the Bow Street Runners . But I hope and trust that , with God 's help , we shall get to the heart of this matter ourselves . " He rose and excused himself , saying he must find out if Rawlinson and Senderby had returned with the special constables . After he was gone , Julian said to MacGregor , " He could spare himself a good deal of anguish by turning over this investigation to another mag-istrate . " " This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't give up command unless and until there 's clear evidence one of his family had something to do with the murder . " " And he 's invited me to ferret out that evidence , if I can . What a devil of a task . I wish I could believe the murderer was a housebreaker , or some disgruntled labourer bent on terrorizing the landed gentry . But the evidence just does n't point that way . " He reviewed with MacGregor the problem of access to and from the house  --  above all , the impossibility that any stranger could have escaped without either being seen or leaving a door unfastened behind him . " That 's a poser , " MacGregor admitted . " But as to how the murderer got in  --  he could have come in with the girl . We know she sneaked in somehow , late this afternoon . If one could do it , why not two ? " " You 're assuming she got in shortly before she was killed . And we do n't know that , do we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days . " " And nobody happened to notice her ? "  | " This is a very large house . She could have hidden in some unused room  --  or someone could have hidden her . " " Confound it , Kestrel , this is a respectable English house  --  not something out of The Mysteries of Udolpho ! " " I do n't know . I 'm beginning to feel distinctly like a character in one of Mrs. Radcliffe 's novels . All right : Let 's suppose the girl got in within the last four-and-twenty hours . How might she have done that without being seen ? Travis is positive no one climbed through any of the windows . That leaves us with the front door , the back door , and the French doors in the conservatory . Any one of them might have been left unlocked and unattended long enough for the girl to slip in . But how could she have known that ? She 'd be taking an immense risk , entering through one of those doors and hoping no one would be there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she got in somehow ! " " Oh , unquestionably . But I think she had the cooperation of someone in the house  --  someone who watched for her and let her in when the coast was clear . That would have been easier at night than in the daytime ? No , perhaps I 'm wrong . Guy told me dogs guard the house at night . She could n't have come near without their raising an outcry . " " Not if somebody they knew was with her , " MacGregor pointed out reluctantly . " True . " Julian looked thoughtful . " Guy came in last night at one or two in the morning . I know because he stopped by my room . He was bosky , but still fairly lucid . He said he uses the back door to get in and out at odd hours . " " You think he might have brought the girl in with him ? " " He complained of not having any female company last night . " That might , of course , have been a blind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bringing a girl into the house for the worst of reasons , right under Sir Robert 's nose  --  he 'd be more than capable of that ! " " But what is the worst of reasons ? Dalliance  --  or murder ? " " I was referring to what you call dalliance , and I call fornication . But , murder  --  he might be capable of that as well . " " But why ? And why in my room ? "  | " To throw suspicion off himself , maybe . Let 's say he keeps the girl in his room all night , and she 's still there with him the following afternoon , when he says he was taking a nap . She makes him angry somehow , or she threatens to  --  to  --  I know ! ? to go to Sir Robert and Lady Fontclair and tell them he 's been keeping her there . " " I ca n't see him resorting to murder just to avoid a dust-up with his uncle . " " I do n't know . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side . He 's always up to his ears in debt , and Sir Robert 's been known to help him out . But , never mind , let 's just say he decides to get rid of the girl for some reason or other . He finds some excuse to take her to your room between half past four and half past five , knowing there wo n't be anybody in that part of the house at that hour . He 's gotten a knife from somewhere , and he kills her . He tucks her into bed  --  God knows why , unless it 's just his vicious sense of humour . And when her body 's found , he pretends to know nothing about her . " " It 's not a bad theory . God knows , that tale he told about an afternoon nap always seemed a little thin . And it does sound like the sort of thing that would amuse him , to leave a corpse in my bed and see what I would do . But there are legions of questions . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why did he stop by my room and talk to me , as though he had nothing better to do ? And what did he do with her in the morning , while he was at the horse fair ? Then there 's his reaction on hearing about the murder . He seemed as horrified as any of us . He may be an extremely good actor , but ? " Julian shrugged and shook his head . " Maybe what horrified him was guilt , or the fear of being found out . " " Maybe . Though it 's hard to believe the same person who coldbloodedly tucked the girl 's corpse in my bed would feel much remorse about it afterward . " " This thing gets more confusing and complicated the more we talk about it . I do n't know how you lured me into speculating about Guy in the first place . I 've known the Fontclairs for some thirty years , and I 'd as soon not believe any of them committed this crime .  | I tell you frankly , I 'd much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert and Lady Fontclair . " " I understand that . What I find remarkable is that you can still be objective . You could easily have made up your mind that Dipper was the murderer , and blinked away any evidence against the Font-clairs . " " Believe me , that 's what I 'd like to do . But the truth is , I just do n't think your man is a murderer . There 's something about him ? his face , his way of talking , his  --  I do n't know , sweetness , though it seems a funny word to use about a young man . " " I know exactly what you mean . I had the same feeling about Dipper when I first met him  --  and in those days he was as dirty and unprepossessing an object as ever crawled out of the East End . He has a gift for outshining his circumstances . No matter what trouble or squalor he 's steeped in , it seems as though his being there were all a mistake that would be cleared up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in that time he 's proved his worth to me a hundred times over . Put simply , Dipper is as close to an angel as anyone I 've ever known . " MacGregor looked at him thoughtfully . " You 're a puzzle , Julian Kestrel . " " I thought we were talking about Dipper . " " We were . But when you talk about him , or about the murder , I get some sense of what you 're really like . When you talk about yourself , what you say is all fustian . If I 'd met you over dinner , and there had n't been a murder or any kind of upset in the house , I 'd think the same as I did when I first laid eyes on you  --  that you were a coxcomb , vain and light-minded and too clever for your own good , or anybody else 's . " " And now ? " asked Julian , almost shyly . " Now I 'm not so sure . " MacGregor grinned . " If I ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know . Meantime : How are you going to go about this investigation of yours ? " " I 'm going to try to clear up some small mysteries , in the hope of shedding light on the large one . I want to ask Mr. Craddock why his mention of a clearing in the forest should so upset Lady Tarleton.  | I want to have a talk with Miss Fontclair , because I find it hard to believe her artist 's eye could be as unobservant as she says it was when she passed near my room this afternoon . And I should like to ask Guy  --  oh , a number of things . What I 'd most like to know is how Lady Tarleton really cut her hand , but I 'm damned if I know how to get at that subject without putting her on the high ropes . " I 'd also like to find out how the girl got her clothes so dirty and wore out her shoes . I think tomorrow I 'll take a walk round the grounds and see if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit of yellow muslin she tore off the hem of her skirt . The chances of its turning up are n't great  --  but , still , one never knows . " " She could have torn her skirt weeks ago . " " I doubt it . I think she took great care with her appearance . She was very fetching , and a good deal of money had gone into her clothes . Besides , she had a needle and thread in her reticule . She could have mended her hem in half a crack  --  women can do that sort of thing blindfold . But if she tore the dress not long before she died , she would n't have had any chance to mend it . " " I do n't wish to insult you , Kestrel , but I 'm beginning to think you 'd have made a very good lawyer . " " I could n't have abided the wig . I never see a barrister tricked out for court without thinking he looks as if a wire-haired terrier had settled on his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose . " Well , I wish you luck in this bloodhound game you 're playing . I expect I 'll see you at the inquest , if not before . " " Actually , I was hoping to call on you tomorrow . " " What for ? " " Well , to have another argument , anyway . I 've been finding them very bracing . Seriously , I want to talk to you about the murder , and the investigation , and the Fontclairs in general . " " See here , you 're not dragging me into taking sides against the Fontclairs ! " " I do n't want you to take sides . Your objectivity is what I value most . Everyone here has something to hide or someone to protect . This house was thick with intrigue even before I arrived : the Fontclairs have a secret of some sort , and Craddock knows it , and he 's  | using it to force a marriage between his daughter and Hugh . I do n't know if the secret has anything to do with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I know my chances of solving the murder may hinge on my learning all I can about the Fontclairs  --  their history , their character , their connexions . You 've known them for a long time , and you seem to understand them remarkably well . Your help would be invaluable to me . " " Give me one good reason why I should throw in my lot with you , against my longtime neighbours and friends ! " " They do n't need you , " said Julian simply , " and I do . " MacGregor glowered at him . " You can come at the end of the day . I 'll have finished seeing patients by then , unless some emergency crops up . Mind you , this does n't mean I 've made up my mind to trust you . In fact , it 's mostly to keep you under my eye , because there 's no telling what mischief you might get up to on your own . " " Thank you , Doctor . I 'll try not to wreak too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiddlesticks ! And do n't look so pleased with yourself ! " * Rawlinson and Senderby had returned with the special constables . Sir Robert gave them their orders . They were to find out if the murdered girl was known , or had been seen , on the Bellegarde estate or in any of the nearby villages . In particular , they must ask after her at all the local inns and posting houses . Finally , they were to determine whether any strangers had been seen in the neighbourhood during the past few days . Senderby was to have handbills printed , describing the girl and requesting information about her or her murderer . Sir Robert himself would offer a hundred pounds to anyone , other than an accomplice to the crime , who helped bring about a conviction . The mortician arrived . While he and Sir Robert were discussing funeral arrangements , Julian was permitted to speak to Dipper . He went with Senderby to Rawlinson 's office , where Dipper was still confined . On the way , he asked , " Does he know he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him , sir . He took it pretty well . "  | " What sort of place is this lockup of yours ? " " Not so bad of its kind , sir . A bit dark , on account of the windows being small and high up . A bit musty , maybe . A bit cold , but that do n't matter so much at this time of year . " Julian , who had heard what pestholes some village gaols were , presumed the worst . He stopped Senderby in the corridor . " Here . See that he 's comfortably housed and well fed , and has a fire if he needs one . And you need n't mention to him that we had this con-versation . " " This is a lot of money , sir  --  I would n't know what to do with it all . " Do what you like with it . Feed him on champagne and lobster salad , and yourself as well , for all I care . Just see that he 's not in want . I shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been neglected or ill-treated , I shall make myself very unpleasant to whomever is responsible . Do you understand ? " " Yes , sir . " They went on to Rawlinson 's office  --  a cramped little burrow of a place . An oak writing desk took up most of the space , while all around it were shelves of ancient books and stacks of parchment . Dipper had fallen asleep at the desk . When Julian and Senderby came in , he lifted his head and blinked . His face lit up . " Sir ! " Julian felt he was being hailed as a rescuer , and had done nothing whatever to deserve it . He said sharply to Senderby , " That will be all . " " Sir Robert did n't say I was to leave the two of you alone . " " Did he say you were to remain with us ? " " Well  --  no , he did n't say that , neither . " " Then you may go . If you 're afraid I might help Dipper escape , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door , away from those challenging eyes . " That 's all right , sir , I ? I do n't need to do that . " He slipped out of the room . Julian glanced out after him , to make sure there were no eavesdroppers lurking . The moment he closed the door , Dipper burst out : " I ca n't tell you how sorry I am , sir , giving Sir Robert the dead heave like that . It 's all on account of , when you 're on the cross , like  | I was before I knew you , sir , you never tells the truth to a beak ? not if he was to ask you if the sun is out , or if London Bridge is in London . It 's a long time since I was in the ring , but it all come back to me , suddenlike , when Sir Robert started asking me questions . I thought something 'd been pinched from your room , and maybe you 'd told Sir Robert I used to have light fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was worse , maybe you 'd think I done it . And if you ever thought I could steal from you , sir  --  why , sir , I 'd lie down and die . So I said I was outdoors , clean away from the house , up until I come in to dinner . I did n't know they could prove I was wrinkling . And now they think I croaked that mort as was found in your room , and that wo n't do you no good , sir . " " It does seem likely to dampen people 's enthusiasm for inviting me to country house parties . There 's only one way to clear both our names : I 've got to find out who really killed the girl . " " How will you do that , sir ? " " By being generally inquisitive . By snapping at heels and listening at keyholes and skulking behind arrases . But depend upon it , I will do it . You 'll barely have got used to that lockup where they mean to put you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the murderer 's not found right away , Sir Robert ca n't keep you in gaol for more than three days without charging you , and since he wo n't find any more proof against you than he has now , he 'll have to let you go . " " I 'd like that , sir . But being in the stone jug 's not so bad . I been there lots of times in town , and now I 'll get to see what it 's like in daisyville . It 'll be a education , like . " " That , as my esteemed friend Dr. MacGregor would say , is moonshine . And it 's very impertinent of you to comfort me when I 'm trying to comfort you . " " I 'm sorry , sir . Sir ? " " Yes ? " " Do you forgive me , sir ? For trying it on with Sir Robert , I mean . " " I 'll forgive you anything , if only it will stop you looking like a woebegone lamb . Do you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you can remember you 're now a law-abiding subject , and have nothing to lie about ? "  | " I will , sir  --  I wish my eyes may drop out if I do n't ! " " What worries me is that , if this crime is n't solved within a week , Sir Robert plans to send to London for help . The last thing we need is to have some Bow Street Runner recognize you for a notorious thief . " " I du n no if I ever got to be no-tor-yus , " said Dipper modestly . " But a lot of robin redbreasts 'd know who I was if they clapped eyes on me . " " Then we 've got to get to the bottom of this crime as soon as possible , before your redbreasted friends start flocking to Alderton . " He pictured the Bow Street officers  --  stout , pugnacious men , their thumbs thrust into the armholes of their red waistcoats . " Are you sure you remember nothing out of the ordinary  --  no matter how small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left it this afternoon ? " " I 've thought and thought , sir . I did n't see or hear nothing . " Senderby poked his head in . " Sir Robert says I 'm to take Mr. Stokes away now . " Dipper turned to Julian . " Your togs is all in order , sir . Michael 's got the polish for your boots . Good-bye and good hunting , sir . " " Good-bye . Never doubt for a moment , we 'll catch our fox . " There was nothing more to be done that night . Julian retired to bed in the guest room next door to his old room . He recalled what Philippa had said about the renovated guest rooms on this corridor : " You might as well live inside a piece of Wedgwood . " That certainly described this room , with its pastel-painted walls and delicate mouldings of ribbons and rosettes . It was nearly three in the morning by the time he got to bed . At last I 've got leisure to think this whole thing out from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he fell asleep .  | Julian dreamed he heard a woman screaming , and woke to find that the screaming was real . It came from the direction of the servants ' wing . Starting up from his bed , he pulled on trousers , a shirt , and his dressing gown . He rushed across the hallway , through the great chamber and down the grand staircase . On the lower flight of stairs , he stopped . His eyes met Guy Fontclair 's . Guy was coming through the great hall from the direction of the screens passage . He wore riding clothes and carried a rain-drenched greatcoat with a short cape attached . His boots were mud-stained , and his wavy hair stuck to his brow in curlicues . The smell of wet wool hung thickly about him . He got rattled on seeing Julian . " I might have known you 'd be stalking round the house at this hour , like Hamlet 's ghost , or Mac-beth 's , or whoever 's ghost it was . " " I heard a woman scream . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think she 'd never seen a man with a cape over his head before . " " It was you who made her scream , then . " " Do n't say that as though I crept up behind her with a knife ! All that happened was , I came in through the back door and ran into Dorcas in the servants ' hall . I had my cape flung over my head to keep the rain off , so she could n't see who I was . She started shrieking  | fit to bring the house down . I had to shake her before I could get her to leave off . And of course the servants came pouring in from all sides and gaped at us as though we were a Punch and Judy show . Damn their eyes ! " " You ca n't blame them for being in a nervous state . " " Well , they had no call to jump down my throat like that . I come in the back door at this hour all the time . " " They probably were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last night . " " I go out in all kinds of weather , damn you ! I 'm not somebody 's grandmother ! " " Neither am I , but I 'd have needed a devil of a good reason to be out in a storm like that . " " I had a good reason . I wanted to get out of this house . I could n't sleep , thinking about all of us traipsing past that girl 's body with a candle , looking at her . " " You seemed to be much affected . " " I was sick , if that 's what you mean . I do n't like looking at dead people . Not that I 've seen all that many , in case you were thinking I go around leaving them in other people 's beds . " He came over and sat down wearily on the stairs . Julian sat down beside him . " That 's one reason I 've never gone into the army , " he added , " though I think the colonel would have liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says there 's got to be at least one Fontclair in uniform every generation . It 's not that I 'm a coward ! I like a good fight as much as anyone . But death is dif-ferent . " Can this be a performance ? Julian thought . It sounds absolutely sincere . And yet , is n't it exactly what a murderer would say , to excuse his squeamishness on being confronted with the body of his victim ? He said , " A woman 's death is certainly different . I found it painful , too , seeing how young and frail she was , and how beautiful . " Guy got up abruptly and walked a few steps away . " It 's a damned rotten business , " he muttered . " The murderer has to be found . "  | " I know that ! Everybody knows that . " " Sir Robert 's agreed to let me take part in the investigation . My man is in gaol and may be charged with the crime  --  I have a large stake in finding out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question ? " " What is it ? " " You told me the room where the girl was killed used to be yours . " " What the deuce is there in that ? " " I thought you might have some idea why the girl and the murderer might have gone there . Could they have been looking for something ? " " I 'm damned if I know . It 's too bloody early for riddles . I 'm all to pieces , and I 'm going to bed . " " I just have one more question . I wish I could think of a more subtle way to put this  --  but are you in the habit of carrying a knife ? " " No , I 'm not ! I have a pocket knife , but I did n't bring it with me to Bellegarde . I can prove that if I have to . " Julian stood up . " Thank you for answering my questions . If you think of anything strange or remarkable about the room , will you let me know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room ? " " Because I think it 's important , in some way we do n't under-stand . " He yawned . " What a dreary time of day this is . The blackest night is brighter than a rain-soaked dawn in England . " He went back to his room . The house was very still . Apparently none of the Fontclairs and Craddocks had been roused by Dorcas 's screaming . That was not surprising : Julian 's room was closer to the servants ' wing than any of theirs . His old room was closer still : as best he could visualize , it must abut Rawlinson 's office on the upper floor of the servants ' wing . He wished he had a plan of the house , so that he could study exactly how the rooms were arranged . Perhaps Rawlinson could find one for him . He went back to bed , though without much hope of being able to sleep any longer . But exhaustion came to his aid : when next he opened his eyes , it was nine o'clock .  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but found she could not eat . As soon as good manners permitted , she left the table and went into the library . Julian followed her . Hugh , seeing them disappear one after the other , felt as though someone had given his collar a nasty twist . Confound the man ! he thought . Why did I ever invite him ? " Oh ! " said Maud . " Mr. Kestrel . " " Am I disturbing you ? " " No . " " I was concerned , seeing you at breakfast . I thought you looked distressed . I think you still do . " " Well of course , I 'm troubled about the murder . Everyone is . " " No one more than I. But , all the same , I managed to sleep a little last night . " His gaze lingered on the shadows under her eyes . He might as well have reached out and traced them with his fingers . " I am worried , " she faltered . " But  --  I ca n't tell you why . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to trust me . You enlisted me in your service  --  cavalier extraordinary . " " Yesterday there had n't been a murder , and all sorts of things had n't happened . " " Miss Craddock , if you know something  --  anything  --  that might throw light on the murder , I ca n't urge you strongly enough to tell it . A man I believe with all my heart to be innocent is under suspicion . A guilty man may go free . " She clasped her hands and walked about distractedly . " I would n't for the world keep anything back that might prove your servant 's innocence , or help catch the real murderer . But , you see , this may not have anything to do with the murder . And it is n't my secret . If it were , I would n't think twice about telling you . I trust you , Mr. Kestrel  --  indeed I do . " " Will you think very carefully about whether you ought to keep this back ? In an investigation like this , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't begin to guess . "  | She shook her head . " Once you tell a thing , it 's told forever . You ca n't take it back . If I made a mistake ? " " Every kind of concealment is dangerous now . My servant is in gaol because he kept something back , thinking it could hurt him to tell it . And in the end it was his hiding the truth , far more than the truth itself , that spoke against him . " " I just do n't know . I have to think . I will think . " She nodded firmly . " I promise . " By midmorning , the sky had cleared , and the house was full of sunshine . Sir Robert ordered Travis and one of the special constables to comb Julian 's old room , the corridor , and the rooms nearby for evidence that might have been missed last night . Julian watched the search for a while , but finding it a methodical business , unlikely to produce any revelations , he went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rawlinson was looking haggard . He was one of those people , Julian thought , who crave the safety of familiar tasks and a comfortable routine . The murder had introduced a foreign element into his world , and he was restive , bewildered , and a little resentful . " What can I do for you , Mr. Kestrel ? " " Would you be good enough to lend me the notes you took on the enquiries last night ? " " Those are official papers . I do n't think they ought to leave my hands . " " Could we compromise and say they wo n't leave your office ? I can look at them here . " " Well  --  I suppose that would be all right . Sir Robert says you 're to take part in the investigation . " " Exactly . Thank you . There is one other thing . I would be very grateful if you could find me a plan of the house  --  the more detailed , the better . " " I think there were plans drawn up when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can find them . " " Thank you . "  | Julian sat down at Rawlinson 's desk , and Rawlinson gave him his notes on the investigation . " There 's pen and paper there , " he said , " if you 'd like to make any notes of your own . " He coughed . " Would you mind if I left you ? I have all kinds of business to attend to . This murder is taking up a really shocking amount of time . " " Not at all , " said Julian readily . The room was too cramped for two people , anyway . Rawlinson must have the constitution of a mole , to be able to work in here . Rawlinson went out . Julian took out his penknife to sharpen a pen , then looked at it thoughtfully . The blade on an ordinary penknife was , of course , too short to have stabbed the girl to death . But what a devil of a lot of knives we use in everyday life , he thought . There must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murderer could have used . Knives in the kitchen , knives in the stable for cutting twine and physicking the horses , pruning knives in the conservatory , hunting knives in the gun room . The men may carry pocket knives  --  though Guy says , with a good deal of unnecessary vehemence , that he did n't bring his to Bellegarde . The women most likely have scissors  --  we know Lady Tarleton does ? and those scissors women use for fancywork have infernally thin , sharp blades . Then , of course , Dr. MacGregor 's been teaching Lady Fontclair medical treatments , which means she may have a knife for removing splinters or lancing boils . And an artist needs something to sharpen her pencils , though she probably uses a penknife , like this one . He gave up that line of enquiry for now . Dipping his pen in ink , he wrote at the top of a sheet of paper : " Day of the Murder : Chro-nology . " Then he wrote for some minutes , using Rawlinson 's notes to confirm his memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I were at horse fair Lady Fontclair had morning callers Whereabouts of Sir Robert , Miss Fontclair , Lady Tarleton. and Mr. and Miss Craddock unknown I. oo Luncheon  | About 2.30 Miss Craddock and I talked in music room Sir Robert , Lady Fontclair , and Hugh reviewed legal papers Lady Tarleton in her room sewing all afternoon Whereabouts of Miss Fontclair .

For his chronology assumed that all the Fontclairs and Craddocks told the truth about their movements yesterday , when in fact he felt sure that some , or even most , of them had been lying . Still , there was something to be said for making himself familiar with their stories , so that he would be quick to notice any discrepancies . He gave some thought to the condition of the suspects ' clothes . All the Fontclairs and Craddocks except Sir Robert had dressed for dinner yesterday evening . That meant that , if one of them killed the girl , he or she had an opportunity to change clothes after the murder , and perhaps to clean any bloodstains off his or her garments . The girl 's clothes had been dirty , but that did not mean the mur-derer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been tracked near the washstand suggested that the murderer 's shoes , at least , were clean . And if any of the suspects ' clothes were soiled , there might be perfectly innocuous explanations . Geoffrey and Craddock had been out riding before dinner . Isabelle had been sitting outside . Guy had  | changed back into his riding clothes and gone out in a violent rainstorm . All in all , Julian did not think a search of people 's clothes would be very illuminating  --  which was just as well , since Sir Robert probably would not allow it . If someone 's clothes did have a story to tell , it would most likely come out anyway . Each suspect 's wardrobe was cared for by a maid or valet , who would notice if any garment was stained or torn , or mysteriously went missing . Surely any servant who had such information would tell it for one reason or other  --  moral duty or fear , the desire for importance or the lure of an official reward . Unless , of course , loyalty to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was the bane of the investigation . There was simply no knowing who might not lie to protect someone else from prosecution , or the family honour from disgrace . It might have been loyalty that made the Fontclairs ' servants so chary of talking to Julian when Sir Robert was not by . Either that , or they believed he had committed the murder , or connived with Dipper to commit it . The simplest question was enough to put Michael , the footman , on his guard . " Do you know where Miss Fontclair is ? " Julian asked him . " No , sir . " " Do you know if she 's in the house ? " " No , sir . " " No , you do n't know , or no , she is n't in the house ? " " She went out , sir . " " We begin to make progress . Have you any idea where she went ? " " No , sir . " " Did she ride or drive , or was she on foot ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gather she often sits in a spot called the rose arbour . " " I would n't know , sir . My duties do n't take me into the garden . " " Where in the garden is the rose arbour ? " " I could n't say , sir . My duties do n't ? "  | ? take you into the garden . So you said . You might as well tell me , Michael . I 'll just keep asking till someone does . " The boy looked down from his tall height with a harassed , rebellious face . At last he sighed and gave it up . " You go out through the conservatory windows , sir , and down the terrace stairs . You keep going down the main path , till you reach the wilderness garden . The rose arbour is there . " " Thank you very much . " Walking stick in hand , Julian descended the terrace stairs and followed the central garden path . It led between orderly beds of flowers , through topiary arches , and past small fountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall border of hedges , Nature shook off the restraints of pruning and mowing . Rhododendrons grew in charming confusion , apple trees offered their little wild fruits to the birds , magnolia blossoms fluttered against austere birches , poppies splashed colour over the ground . Julian shaded his eyes and looked about him , trying to catch the sight or the scent of roses . In the end , he found the arbour quite by chance . It appeared suddenly round a corner of his path : an archway of delicate latticework , with a marble bench inside . Roses , pink and red and white , climbed the sides of the arch , dangled from the top , and nestled in the gaps of the wrought-iron trellising . Isabelle sat among the roses , her dove-grey gown dappled with sunlight , her open sketchbook in her lap . Her bonnet lay on the ground nearby . She must have heard him coming , for she was looking toward him expectantly . It would be no small feat , he thought , to take Isabelle Fontclair by surprise . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here hoping to find you . " " You have questions for me , I suppose . " " I did . But seeing you here , with the sun on your hair and the roses clustering round you , I 've all but forgotten what they are . " " Must you begin again , Mr. Kestrel ? " " I 'm sorry . I know you asked me to leave off . But when you sit in the most idyllic spot in the garden , wearing a halo of sunshine in place of a hat , how can you expect me to keep my head ? A poet would be driven to frenzy in this place  --  any man with blood in his  | veins would be hard-pressed not to throw himself at your feet . I think on the whole my behaviour 's been a marvel of restraint . " " I think you have it in your power to restrain it further . Would you please hand me my bonnet ? I only take it off in order to work . " " If you really had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence to the landscape as to cover your hair and cast the shadow of a hat brim across your face . " " This is my favourite place , Mr. Kestrel . Please do n't be so unkind as to drive me away from it . " " God forbid I should be unkind to you . I 'd be kindness itself , if you would let me . " " Do you mean to give me my bonnet , or must I get it myself ? " He brought it to her . She put it on . The wide brim curved over her brow , giving her rather long face a heart shape . " Thank you . " His eyes fell on her drawing . " Is that the design for Miss Crad-dock 's slippers ? " " Yes . I showed it to her this morning . She seemed to approve of it . Would you like to look at it ? " She offered him the sketchbook . " It 's to be white silk thread on white satin . " It was a pattern of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderfully natural , yet were arranged with symmetry and grace . How like her , he thought , to lavish such care and virtuosity on a detail of Maud 's wedding clothes that would hardly be noticed . He suddenly remembered Guy 's conviction that Isabelle had wanted to marry Hugh herself . If that were true , how must she feel , crafting a wedding gift for her successful rival ? " I have to start on them as soon as possible , " she said , " or they wo n't be finished in time for the wedding . Unless you think the wedding will be put off , on account of the murder ? " " I could n't say . It 's possible . " She would have taken back the sketchbook , but he asked , " May I look at your other drawings ? " She nodded . He would have liked to sit next to her on the bench , but she did not make room for him , so he stood beside her . He flipped to the beginning of the sketchbook and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A sense of sun and shadow pervaded her landscapes , without any need for colour . Architectural details of  | Bellegarde were drawn with skill and understanding . She captured people , especially her family , with a light , deft touch . One sketch that Julian particularly admired showed the Fontclairs in their drawing room : Sir Robert reading , Lady Fontclair smiling at the colonel across a card table , Lady Tarleton sewing with a look of grim concentration on her face . Hugh was daydreaming , Joanna was looking at fashion plates , and Philippa was building a house of cards . It was as though Isabelle had wanted to portray each person doing something typical of him or her . Elsewhere she had made studies of their faces , showing how the family features varied in each : austere in Sir Robert , stark and dramatic in Lady Tarleton , jaunty and a little weak in the colonel , open and earnest in Hugh . She had exposed , with truth but not without compassion , the contrast between Jo-anna 's conventional prettiness and Philippa 's thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask a question  --  then thought better of it . He praised her work , and they talked about her training and technique . But you did n't come here to talk to me about art , " she said at last . " If you want to question me about the murder , I 'd just as soon have it over . " " Of course . Miss Fontclair , you 're an artist , and your work shows you have an eye for nuances  --  for details most of us would miss . It intrigues me that you passed so close to my room at about twenty minutes past five . Of course , the murder might have taken place as much as fifty minutes earlier . It could also have happened within about a quarter of an hour afterward , though in that case the girl and the murderer might well have been in my room by the time you passed by . " " Are n't you overlooking the possibility that I am the murderer ? " He was taken aback . " I suppose I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't think of any reason you should believe me . " " You really are the most remarkable woman . " " Again , Mr. Kestrel ? " " I was n't flirting with you  --  not just then , anyway . I 'm impressed , that 's all . " " Thank you . What exactly is your question ? " " Are you sure you ca n't remember seeing or hearing anything out  | of the common , from the time you came in through the conservatory windows till you reached your own room ? " " I 've been thinking about it ever since last night , but I still ca n't remember anything to the purpose . I do think , if there 'd been anything out of place , I would have noticed . I am observant , and I know the house well . As to hearing anything  --  I was n't really paying attention . If there was some noise in your room , I did n't notice . I do n't think there could have been raised voices or a struggle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have one more question . I 'm afraid it 's unpleasant . " " Your questions do tend to be . What is it ? " " How do you sharpen your pencils ? " Her eyes widened . " You are being thorough , are n't you ? " " Well , it would be a great help to identify the murder weapon . I do n't have much hope on that score . If I were the murderer , I should probably have thrown it down a well or buried it under a loose paving stone , or some such thing . Still , I 've been trying to find out if any knife 's gone missing . " " My knife has n't gone missing . I have it here . " She opened her sketching box . Her pencils and India rubbers were neatly arrayed inside . In a slot of its own was a knife with a mother-of-pearl handle . She gave it to Julian . " You use this to sharpen your pencils ? " He drew the knife out of its black velvet sheath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's not very practical , " she admitted . " A penknife would be easier and safer to use . Aunt Catherine is always warning me I 'll cut myself with that one . But you see , that knife belonged to my father . It 's one of the few things I have of his . Most of his possessions were sold when he died . He was deeply in debt . " " Who were your parents ? " " My father was Simon Fontclair . His father and Uncle Robert 's father were brothers , so of course Uncle Robert is n't really my uncle , but my first cousin once removed . My parents died of influenza when I was three , and Uncle Robert and Aunt Cecily took me in . It was very good of them . My father did n't leave me a farthing . He had all manner of schemes to make his fortune  --  a half-finished invention ,  | a plantation in Barbados  --  but they always came out bluely . He was a weak man , " she finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Julian gave her back the knife . " Did you ever leave your sketching box unattended between half past four and six o'clock yesterday ? " " No . I had it with me when I came out here to work on my design for Miss Craddock 's slippers , and when I came in , I brought it with me . So no one could have used my knife to kill the girl . Except me , of course . " He asked frankly , " Miss Fontclair , if you had seen or heard anything that might implicate one of your family in the murder , would you admit it ? " Isabelle met his gaze steadily . " No , Mr. Kestrel , I would not . "  | On returning to the house , Julian was summoned to Sir Robert 's office . Sir Robert told him that the search in and around the room where the body was found had turned up nothing of interest ? nothing stolen , no sign of a struggle , and no indication of how the girl or the murderer got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the house . " Have you heard from Senderby yet ? " asked Julian . " No , but he should be coming shortly to report on his enquiries in the neighbourhood . " He added , " The vicar and his wife called a little while ago . They said the news is all over Alderton , and of course it 's causing a tremendous stir . God grant we 'll be able to solve the crime quickly , and put an end to the panic and the morbid curiosity it 's excited . " I believe he means that prayer sincerely , Julian thought . He really ca n't credit that any of his family could be guilty . Sir Robert handed Julian some large sheets of parchment . " Rawlinson told me you 'd asked to see a plan of the house . These are the designs for the new wing , which was built in my father 's time . The architects also made these sketches of the main house and the servants ' wing , though those parts of the house were n't touched during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans on a table : the  | servants ' wing , the main house adjacent to it , and the new wing branching off the rear corner of the main house . He laid out the first-floor plans in the same pattern . The house looked odd and unfamiliar , seen from this bird 's eye view . Vast , imposing rooms like the great hall and the great chamber were reduced to small square blocks , while a cubby-hole like Rawlinson 's office looked far larger than it really was . He said , " I ca n't conceive of anyone approaching the front door secretly . There 's nothing but open space around it-the carriage court , the drive and the front lawn . The route through the garden to the conservatory windows provides more cover , but the best way to enter the house in secret would be from the back , through the silver lime grove or the kitchen garden . " He pointed to the small room where the back door was . " I believe you told me this is used as a waiting room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have business in the servants ' wing . " " It seems to be just beneath Rawlinson 's office , which is next to my old room . So near and yet so far . " Sir Robert nodded . " Anyone standing at the back door could look up at your room , but in order to get inside it , he would either have to scale the wall and climb in through the window , of come in through the back door and go through the servants ' hall , across the screens passage , through the great hall , and up the grand staircase . " " Scaling the wall is an interesting thought . It 's not likely anyone climbed the tree outside the window , since the ground , was n't disturbed at all . But underneath the window , a few feet away from the wall , is a paved walk , which would n't show footprints or marks made by a ladder . Though it 's hard to imagine anyone being so bold as to set up a ladder in broad daylight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispersed about the house and grounds . Besides , if there was a ladder , what became of it ? The murderer ca n't have used it to get out again , because the window was left bolted from the inside . " Look at it how you will , he thought , the same conclusion always results . The murderer must be a member of this household  --  some-  | one who could let the girl in on the sly , take her to my room and kill her , and then go about his business as though nothing had happened . He would have to be an acrobat , or a magician , to get into the house , kill the girl , and disappear without a trace . " Mr. Kestrel ! " " Yes , Lady Tarleton ? " " I want to speak to you . Come into the library . " When they got there , she turned to face him , her head high , her blue eyes flashing . " My brother tells me you mean to go on playing the policeman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions . I do n't know in what den of ill breeding you may have been brought up , but civilized people , when staying as guests in other people 's houses , do not accuse their hosts of telling lies and committing monstrous crimes . " " I have n't accused anyone . I 've simply been asking questions . Some of the answers I 've received make matters even less clear than before . Which means I 'm obliged to ask more questions  --  at the risk , I know , of making myself a very unwelcome guest . " " You 've done rather more than ask questions , Mr. Kestrel ! Last night you as good as accused me of telling blatant untruths . " " I was puzzled by some things you said . That is n't quite the same as branding you a perjuror . " " A perjuror ! How dare you ! " " Lady Tarleton , I beg your pardon if I 've offended you . Believe me , if my servant 's life , and my own honour , were n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than ride roughshod over your feelings . " " You flatter yourself , Mr. Kestrel . I assure you , my feelings are n't at the mercy of any such impertinent upstart as you . I do n't know why you must needs meddle in the investigation , anyway . Why ca n't you leave it to Senderby and the special constables ? What do you suppose we appoint them for , if not to do the sort of necessary but distasteful work that a gentleman would never dream of stooping to ? "  | " If I saw someone drowning or about to be trampled by horses , I would n't ask myself whether it 's a gentleman 's task to jump into the river or spring to the horses ' heads . " " Oh , I see ! We are to hail you as a hero , then . " " I did n't mean that ! " he said , stung . He checked himself , got a grip on his temper , and smiled . A touch , Lady Tarleton , he admitted  --  but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! As he turned back to her , his gaze lit on the chatelaine at her waist . He remembered she had worn it yesterday , too , before she changed for dinner . It had five slender chains , each with a ring at the end to hold some household item : a purse , a thimble case , a pincushion , a dainty notebook . " What are you staring at ? " she demanded . " I was noticing that one of your chains is empty . Is that where you used to keep your embroidery scissors ? " " Again about my scissors ! Is it a crime , Mr. Kestrel  --  is it a moral outrage  --  to drop an embroidery scissors and cut one 's finger picking it up ? " " One of us seems outraged , Lady Tarleton , but it is n't I. " " I suppose you expect me to show you the broken scissors . Shall I go and fetch it and prove I 've been telling the truth ? " " That would be extremely kind of you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been speaking sarcastically , never dreaming he would have the effrontery to send her on such an errand . Yet she would not go back on the offer , once given . She has scruples of a sort , MacGregor had said of her , and it was true . " Very well , Mr. Kestrel ! I ca n't tell you how contemptible I find you  --  demanding physical proof of a lady 's truthfulness ! But if I must lay the scissors in your hands to make you believe me , so be it . Wait for me here . " She swept out . While she was gone , he strolled about the library , spinning the two great globes , one terrestrial , one celestial , and running his eyes over the books . They were shelved in regimental order , according to author and subject . The volume of Pope 's verses was back in its place among Pope 's other works . He wondered how Sir Robert could have taken a quarter of an hour to find it yesterday . " Here you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | down on one of the long , polished tables . " If there are any other demeaning errands you 'd like me to run , please do n't hesitate to ask . " " Thank you . " He picked up the scissors . It was badly damaged . The two pieces had come apart , and the thinner , sharper blade was dented and scratched . There were traces of a dark stain on it that looked like blood . Lady Tarleton 's blood , most likely  --  but , as MacGregor had said , there was no way to tell . This wicked little blade could certainly have been used to kill the girl . But stabbing a person , however viciously , would not have etched these scratches in the metal . On the other hand , neither would merely dropping the scissors on the floor . " You 're still suspicious , are n't you ? " she said . " You mean to go on prying and persecuting us all  --  when the real , the obvious killer is already in gaol ! And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " I do n't think so , Lady Tarleton . Because before that happens , I swear I will take this house apart stone by stone and wring the heart of every person in it , till I find out who really killed the girl . " Her hands went to her throat . " What ? what are you going to do next ? " " Among other things , I 'm going to question Mr. Craddock . I 'd like to know more about that clearing in the forest he went to have a look at yesterday . " She trembled . Her fists clenched and unclenched . " There are some things at Bellegarde you must n't meddle with . " " That may be so . But there are other things I must meddle with , and the devil of it is , I do n't know which are which . " " You 'll cause more harm than you can begin to guess ! But you do n't care , do you ? " She laughed bitterly . " A kestrel is a kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were very aptly named for a bird of prey ! " * Luncheon was served before Julian had a chance to talk to Craddock . Halfway through the meal , a servant brought word that Sen-  | derby had arrived . Sir Robert and Julian hastily excused themselves and went to Sir Robert 's office . Senderby had two people with him . One was a boy of seventeen or eighteen , with a ruddy face , unruly brown hair , and a snub nose . He wore a short coat , grubby trousers , and boots . The other was a middle-aged woman in a faded brown calico dress , the sleeves pushed up , above her scrawny elbows . Her greying hair was scraped back from her face and covered with a limp straw bonnet . You know Mrs. Warren , sir , " Senderby said to Sir Robert , " and Dick Felton from the Blue Lion . They 're the only ones I can find that had any talk with the girl afore she died . " Mrs. Warren plucked at her apron . She looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at any moment . Felton seemed to be enjoying himself . He stood rocking back on his heels and looking around him with shrewd , interested eyes . Sir Robert said to them , " You have been brought here to give information regarding the young woman who was found dead in this house yesterday evening . My clerk " ? he gestured toward Rawlin-son ? " will take down your statements and ask you to sign them . I urge you to be as thorough , accurate , and , of course , truthful as possible . This is a very serious crime , but with the help of conscientious witnesses like yourselves , I feel certain we will soon bring the murderer to justice . " He sat down at his desk . " Felton , please come forward . Preliminarily , your name is Richard Felton , and you are an ostler at the Blue Lion posting house in Alderton . Is that correct ? " " Yes , sir . " The boy stepped forward eagerly . At a nudge from Senderby , he took his hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the young woman in question ? " " The day afore yesterday . She drove up to the Lion in a yellow bounder . " " That is to say , a hired chaise and pair . " " Yes , sir . She hired it in Hammersley . I reco'nized the postboy and the horses . " " Hammersley is a village some ten miles south of Alderton , " Sir Robert told Julian .  | " Yes , I remember . I changed horses there on my way up from London . " " Did the girl come from London ? " Sir Robert asked . " I du n no where she started , sir . All I know is , Hammersley 's the last place she changed horses . " " Had you ever seen her before ? " " I did n't see her then , sir  --  not properly . She had a veil over her face . But I 've been showed her body , and it 's the same young lady . No doubt in my mind about that . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bag , there . " He pointed to a blue worsted travelling bag with wooden handles , on a table behind him . " Have you looked through it yet ? " Julian asked Senderby . " Yes , sir . I made a list of what 's in it . " He fumbled in his pockets till he found a paper , from which he read haltingly , " One blue dress , one handkerchief , one hairbrush , one looking glass , one nightdress , one cap , one  --  er  --  change of ladies ' linen , one string of wood beads with a cross attached . " " A rosary ? " asked Julian , surprised . " I think that 's what it is , sir . I never seen one before . " " A lot of foreigners mumble over beads , " said Felton . " They do n't know no better . " " Was the girl a foreigner ? " asked Sir Robert . " Yes , sir . " " How do you know ? " " By the way she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke with an accent ? " said Julian . " That 's the ticket , sir . " " What kind of accent ? " " A foreign accent , " said Felton impatiently . " I mean , from what country ? " " I do n't know that , sir . " " Does anyone know ? " Sir Robert asked Senderby . " No , sir , " said the constable heavily . " She never gave her name to anybody or said much about herself . " " Was there a name on anything you found in her bag ? " asked Julian .  | " No , sir . " " What about papers , keys , merchant 's labels on her clothes ? " " No , sir . " Sir Robert and Julian exchanged baffled glances . Julian tried out a little French , Italian , and German on Felton , but it was no use : he could not match any accent with the murdered girl 's . Sir Robert bade him go on with his story . " I helped her out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boot . She tipped me handsome , and I stayed around her for a bit , hoping to earn a little more off her somehow . Besides , I was curious about her . She was a stranger and a foreigner , and dressed like a swell . Pretty , too . I could n't make out her face too well , but she had as trim a figure as you 'd ever wish to see . " " The gentlemen do n't need to hear that , " chided Senderby . " Sir Robert said to be truthful and thorough , " the boy retorted . " Anyway , I asked her if she was going to the inn , and could I carry her bag . But she held tight to it and looked around her , furtivelike . Said she 'd rather stay some place quiet , not so public as the Lion . Asked me if I knew any place like that nearby . I told her about Mrs. Warren  --  how she 's got a room in her cottage that she lets to lodgers . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not suited to the likes of her  --  begging your pardon , Mrs. W. But she said she did n't care , so long as it was respectable . She made such a point of that , I began to think she must be a lady and not " ? he winked ? " a ladybird , if you know what I mean . " The end of it was , she thought she 'd like to stay there and asked if it was far . I said , ' It 's just a spit and a stride , miss . I 'd be glad to take you there . ' But she jibbed at that  --  started backing away and said oh no thank you , she would n't bother me to go with her , and would I just give her directions where it was . So I did . She tipped me again  --  plump in the pocket , she must have been  --  took her bag and walked off . I 'd have liked to follow her and see what she was about , but just then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the horses and the passengers and all . So that was the last I saw of her  --  alive , " he finished darkly . " What time of day was it ? " Julian asked .  | " If the Paragon was on time , which I think it was , the young lady must have arrived a bit before seven . " If she left the village on foot , other people must have seen her , " said Sir Robert . " Most of the village was indoors , " said Senderby . " Either that or they were watching the Paragon . Nobody 's got eyes for anything else when the stagecoach is coming in . Still , a few people saw her walk away from the main village street toward the south footpath , that leads to Mrs. Warren 's cottage . After that , nobody saw her but Mrs. Warren  --  till she was found dead here . "  | It was Mrs. Warren 's turn to make her statement . She got through the preliminaries well enough . Her name was Deborah Warren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ west of Alderton , her husband had died some years ago , and she supported herself by growing vegetables and doing fine sewing for weddings and christenings . Her cottage , which she rented from Sir Robert , had a spare room she let to the occasional woman lodger . " And , oh , sir , I had n't had a lodger in weeks , and I did need the money so , or I 'd never have taken her in ! Right from the start I feared she was no better nor she should be , what with her being a foreigner , and travelling all alone like that . Pretty , too , and dressed in them fine clothes  --  and no ring on her finger ! But she looked well able to pay for her room and board , and I just could n't bring myself to turn her away . And she never did pay ! " Mrs. Warren 's voice rose to a wail . " It 's a punishment on me , that I let a wicked girl under my roof ! God forgive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have had something wrong about her , or she would n't have got herself killed like that ! " " How much did she owe you ? " said Sir Robert . Mrs. Warren , who was dabbing her eyes with her apron , looked up and blinked at him hopefully . " I reckoned it out at two shillings ninepence , sir . "  | " I shall take responsibility for the debt . Rawlinson , be good enough to pay Mrs. Warren before she leaves . " " Oh , God bless you , sir , thank you ! " She blew her nose . " In all fairness to the young lady , I ca n't rightly say she never meant to pay , for she went out yesterday morning leaving her bag with all her things in it behind her , like she meant to come back , only ? only ? " Her voice trailed away . " When did you first meet her ? " Sir Robert asked . " She knocked on my door about half past seven the night afore last . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for one . She did n't seem to want to say much about herself , and I did n't like to ask , because , as I told you , sir , I was n't easy in my mind about letting her stay , and I did n't want to know no more about her than I had to . I just called her ' miss . ' I showed her the room , and she said she 'd take it . She did n't make any fuss about the cost . " Mrs. Warren furrowed her brow . " I do n't know what else to tell you . I asked her if she 'd he wanting her meals , and she said yes . " " Did she tell you why she had come to Alderton ? " asked Sir Robert . " No , sir . " " Did you ask her how long she meant to stay ? " asked Julian . " Why , yes , sir , now you mention it , I did , and she said  --  she said ? It 's hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heap by what 's happened . I never was in trouble with the law before in all my days . " " You 're not in trouble with the law , " Julian assured her . " You 're helping the law unravel a very knotty problem , and we 're all grateful . " She looked at him timidly . " I 'm sure I want to do my duty , sir . It 's just that it 's hard . It 's  --  it 's been a hard day . " We 're going about this all wrong , Julian thought . How can she be anything but dazed and fearful  --  here in her landlord 's house , with Rawlinson taking down her every word , and all the law 's majesty brought to bear on her lone self ? We ought to have called on her at her cottage , where she 'd feel more relaxed and in command of things . I think I 'll do exactly that myself , later on , and see if she finds it any easier to answer questions .  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl said she meant to stay . " I think she said as how she did n't know . We left it that she 'd spend the night , and let me know next day if she needed the room any longer . " " What did she do for the rest of the evening ? " asked Sir Robert . " She come down to the kitchen and had her supper  --  just picked at it , really . Then she went back to her room . She did n't come out again till morning . " " How do you know that ? " " My room 's just across the hall from hers , and I sleep very light , sir . I 'd have known if she left her room during the night . " " What happened next morning ? " " She came down and had her breakfast  --  about seven , I think . Then she put on her big shawl and her bonnet with the veil , and went out . And ? and that was the last I saw of her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or when she 'd be back ? " " No , sir . " " Which way did she walk ? " " Down the footpath toward the village . I lost sight of her after she rounded the curve . " " But she never got to Alderton , " said Senderby . " Leastways , I ca n't find nobody that saw her there . The fact is , nobody saw her at all , from the time she left Mrs. Warren 's till her body turned up here . " " Where else besides the village does this footpath lead ? " Julian asked him . " A branch of it leads to the main road west out of Alderton , toward Whitford . If she was on that road , we 'll find somebody that saw her . The horse fair was that morning ; there was a lot of traffic going to Whitford . " " You must keep making enquiries , " said Sir Robert . He added , after a pause , " The same road leads southeast through Alderton to Bellegarde . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir . " Everyone spun around to look at her . " How did you come to tell her that ? " said Sir Robert . " She ? she asked , sir , " gulped Mrs. Warren .  | " She asked you where Bellegarde was ? " " Yes , sir . " " Why did n't you tell us this before ? " " I forgot it , sir ! " Her face crinkled up , and she pressed her handkerchief to her mouth . Julian asked gently , " How did she happen to mention Belle-garde ? " " I was showing her her room , and she looked out the window and said , in her funny speech , ' Please can you tell me where is the house called Bellegarde ? ' I said it was a mile or two southeast . And I asked her , ' What would you be wanting at Bellegarde , miss ? ' And she seemed to take fright , and said she did n't want nothing there , she 'd just heard it was a beautiful house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must confess to you , sir , I ? I had a feeling that was n't true . I thought she 'd made it up on the spur of the moment , like . Oh , deary me , I should have shown her the door after that , I know ! It 's bound to lead to no good , having somebody sleep under your roof that you ca n't trust not to tell you a story . " " Did she tell you anything more about why she came to Alderton , or why she was interested in Bellegarde ? " There was an edge of desperation in Sir Robert 's voice . " No , sir . " " Think very carefully . " Sir Robert leaned toward her over his desk . " Did the girl make any other mention of Bellegarde , or anyone at Bellegarde , during the time she stayed at your house ? " " I do n't think so , sir . No ? no , I 'm pretty sure she did n't . " " Have you told us all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she arrived and the following morning ? " " Well , yes , I think so , sir  --  but it 's hard to remember , as I said . " Julian was thinking : Assuming someone at Bellegarde killed the girl , did that person know in advance she was coming to Alderton ? Or did she just turn up at Bellegarde and give the murderer a nasty surprise ? He asked Mrs. Warren , " Did any messages come for the girl while she was staying with you ? " " Not that I know of , sir . " " Did anyone try to speak with her ? " Mrs. Warren shook her head .  | " Did any strangers come by your house , either the day she arrived or the day she left ? " " No , sir . And I keep a close watch for strangers . Living alone as I do , and my cottage being a bit out of the way , I 'm always afeard of thieves . " Sir Robert thanked Felton and Mrs. Warren , and Rawlinson showed them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palpable relief . Sir Robert got up and walked around his desk , frowning . " This investigation is in every way irregular . As a rule , the victim 's family or friends would take the lead in bringing her murderer to justice . But since we still know next to nothing about who the girl was , I shall have to continue to take sole responsibility for the investigation . " He turned to Senderby . " You must redouble your efforts to find people who saw or spoke with her . And question my servants again . We know now that the girl had a foreign accent : that may strike a chord in someone 's memory . " " We also know she changed horses at Hammersley , on the London road , " said Julian . " If she started her journey in London , she would have had to change horses at least twice before that . Postboys and ostlers might remember her . She may even have spoken with an innkeeper or fellow traveller . Or she might have been seen at a toll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the special constables must trace her journey back to wherever it began . He must go to each posting house and turnpike gate she passed through and glean whatever evidence he can about her identity , the purpose of her journey , and any person who was seen in her company . At the very least , once we know where she came from , we can make enquiries about her there . " Julian was not hopeful that she had dropped clues about herself on her journey . She had clearly wished to keep her movements and identity a secret . She had not told her name to anyone in Alderton , she had spent the night in a retired cottage , and next day she had left Mrs. Warren 's in the early morning , only to appear out of nowhere at Bellegarde in the late afternoon . Still , her appearance had been striking enough to attract attention . Someone , somewhere ,  | 81 might have observed something useful about her . Of course , if she had begun her journey in London , it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They would have to circulate advertisements , offer rewards . And the Bow Street police would be almost certain to take over the investigation . He put those concerns aside for the present . His next task was to go to Alderton and see how Dipper was getting on . He decided not to call on Mrs. Warren till tomorrow ; she needed time to recover from today 's interrogation . Instead , he would pay his promised call on Dr. MacGregor . He felt the need to have a good long talk about the Fontclairs . Julian decided that , instead of riding to Alderton by the main road , he would walk there through the Chase  --  the tract of thick woodland to the north and northwest . That was the route he suspected the murdered girl had taken to reach Bellegarde . If she had come by the main road , she would have had to pass through the center of Alderton , where someone would surely have seen her . Of course , she might also have skirted the south side of the village and approached Bellegarde @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed through the formal garden to the terrace and entered the house through the conservatory windows . But the forest provided more cover and seclusion , which would likely have appealed to someone as secretive as the girl . He wondered how she had known the way , whichever route she took . She had asked Mrs. Warren where Bellegarde was , as though she did not know the neighbourhood at all . Perhaps the murderer had met her and shown her the way , or she had asked someone for directions . But if the latter were true , who  --  and where  --  was that someone ? It took him nearly an hour to get to Alderton through the Chase , but he was moving slowly , taking time to explore as he went along . Fortunately the weather continued fair , so he could use the sun to find his way through the maze of meandering paths . There were broken branches and trampled leaves to suggest someone had recently passed this way , but last night 's rain had washed away any footprints.  | From time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off from the rest of the forest . One of these clearings might well be the one that Craddock visited yesterday . He emerged from the Chase beside a stream that ran parallel to the main road . There was a footbridge , close to an old abandoned building that must have been a mill . He crossed the bridge and walked about a quarter of a mile to the main road . There he doubled back southeast , and soon reached Alderton . From then on , curious spectators dogged his steps . People came out of their houses or paused in their work to gape at him from a safe distance  --  in case , he supposed , he should suddenly become violent or deranged . For of course the whole village knew by now that the mysterious girl had been found in his bed , and that his servant was in gaol under suspicion of her murder . Ignoring the watchers as best he could , he went to Senderby 's cobbler 's shop and told him he wished to visit Dipper . Dipper had the lockup all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was barely ten feet wide . It was shaped like a beehive , with a little domed roof and a padlocked door . The only light came from two small slits set high in the brick walls . There was a pallet bed on one side and a makeshift privy on the other . The smell of the place was foul . " You had n't ought to come in here , sir , " Dipper told Julian . " No human being ought to come in here . But if you can spend a night and a day here , I daresay I can stomach it for a few minutes . " " It ai n't so bad , sir . I 've dossed in much worse cribs nor this . I had a glimmer last night , " ? he pointed to the remains of a small fire ? " and the grub 's first-rate . " He added , " I think you ought to take it out of me wages , sir . " " Take what out of your wages ? " asked Julian coldly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quod . I 'm no gowk , sir  --  I been in and out of the jug since I was a kid , and I know you do n't live so high as this unless somebody 's flapped the dimmock . And what I say is , you ought to take it out of me wages , on account of I would n't be in here if I had n't tried to gammon Sir Robert . " " It 's immaterial to me how you found your way into this paradise . I do n't want you coming out of it ill , and of no use to me whatever .  | And that means I have to ensure you live like something other than a gutter rat . " " That do n't mean I should n't have to pay for it , sir . " " I refuse to have this argument with you . It 's ridiculous and undignified , and I wo n't hear any more about it . " Dipper gave it up . " How 's the hunt going , sir ? " Julian told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl . " And she spoke with a foreign accent , " he finished . " But , of course , that may have been assumed . If she used a veil to disguise her face , why not an accent to disguise her voice ? " " That 's an old dodge , sir , " Dipper agreed . Senderby joined them , saying he had to lock up the gaol so that he could return to the investigation . Julian said to Dipper , " I 'll look in on you again tomorrow . " " I wish you would n't , sir . I 'll be airing out your clothes for days . " " I expect that girl Molly would be happy to help you . Since you left , she 's been looking so peaked , she could probably do with some airing out herself . " He came out of the lockup , blinking at the change from darkness to daylight . A small crowd was on the watch for him . He flicked off his tall silk hat and made them a bow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to Senderby , and asked how to get to Dr. MacGregor's.  | Well , let 's have it , " said MacGregor , plumping down in a homely easy chair . " Which of the Fontclairs have you decided is a cold-blooded murderer ? " He and Julian were seated in his back parlour . It was a bachelor 's snuggery , small and cosy , with furniture worn enough to be lounged in or knocked about with impunity . Julian leaned back in a wing chair , stretching out his legs . " I have n't decided . I 'm very open and unbiased in my suspicions at this stage . The fact is , I think a case can be made against any of the Fontclairs except Hugh . " " Do you realize what you 're saying ? You 're saying that a member of a highly respected old family  --  a family that 's spawned military heroes , members of Parliament , leaders of county society  --  is a murderer . And not even a killer in an honest fight , but a treacherous , cowardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I 've known the Fontclairs some thirty years . Sir Robert is one of the fairest , most conscientious landlords you 'll ever see . And Lady Fontclair is beloved all over the parish . There 's not a soul in Alderton she does n't know by name , and if someone 's in trouble , there she 'll be , with a kind word and an open purse . The others  --  well , they have their faults , but I wo n't believe one of them 's a murderer  --  not till I 've seen proof so plain there 's no gainsaying it . " " I wish I had it to show you . But the little we 've discovered so  | far raises more questions than it resolves . " He told MacGregor what Felton and Mrs. Warren had had to say . " It sounds as though we 've got precious little to show for all this investigating . And even so , you 're convinced one of the Fontclairs is guilty . " " Or Mr. Craddock . " " Well , make your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " In a very belligerent spirit , prepared to pounce like an angry Scots terrier on every flaw in my reasoning . " " If you do n't want an honest opinion , you can keep your reasoning to yourself ! " " I do want it . That 's why I came . " " Well , get on with it , then , " MacGregor grumbled . " I suppose it does n't matter where I begin . I 'll take Lady Tarleton first  --  an honour I doubt she 'd appreciate if she were here . She has no one who can vouch for her whereabouts between half past four and six o'clock yesterday . She has a severe cut on her hand , which she explains by saying she dropped her embroidery scissors , it broke , and she cut her hand picking it up . I 've seen the scissors : it 's thoroughly battered , and I do n't believe it could have got into that condition by being dropped from anything short of a precipice . " " Are you suggesting she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I 'm only saying it 's possible . You did say you thought the murderer could have been a woman . And you said there was no way to tell if all the blood on the bedding and the washbasin was the girl 's . " " Have you got a theory about why Lady Tarleton would have lost her mind and attacked a young female with a scissors ? " " Motive is my Achilles heel . Without knowing who the girl was or anything about her , how can I know why anyone would have wanted her dead ? Lady Tarleton has the devil 's own temper , and she 's been cutting up savage about Hugh 's marriage to Miss Craddock ever since I got to Bellegarde . I can see her resorting to violence to prevent it  --  but how would the girl 's death accomplish that ? The most it could do would be to delay it for a time . I ca n't see Sir Robert mounting a wedding celebration for his heir , with the spectre of an unsolved murder hovering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's true that Lady Tarleton 's as angry as a hornet about Hugh 's marriage . But with her family pride , that 's only to be expected . Craddock was a groom at Bellegarde , you know , years ago . That 's bound to rankle with all of them . " " Guy told me it was Lady Tarleton who brought about Craddock 's dismissal . Have you any idea why ? You 've lived in Alderton long enough to have been here in Craddock 's day . " " I remember hearing he 'd been turned off , but nobody told me the reason , and I did n't ask . The Fontclairs do more or less as they like at Bellegarde , and well beyond it , too . They 're a power to be reckoned with , Kestrel . There are n't many people , high or low , who 'd dare accuse any of them of murder . You 'll see that at the inquest . Mark my words , the coroner will handle them with kid gloves . You wo n't hear him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " So much for justice , " said Julian ironically . MacGregor could not blame him for feeling that way . No one could say with truth that English justice wore a blindfold . If Kestrel ever came to the point of accusing one of the Fontclairs , he would have to prove his case beyond all possible doubt . Anything short of certainty , and the barrier of privilege that enclosed the Fontclairs would protect them from retribution , though suspicion and scandal might cling to their name for generations to come . Julian broke the silence . " Do you know anything about Lady Tarleton 's husband ? I understand he lives abroad . " " He does , and has for a long time . She does n't seem to be eating her heart out missing him . She 's got plenty of money and the run of his house in Suffolk  --  though she never goes there . If you ask me , she 's always thought of herself as a Fontclair first and Sir Ber-trand 's wife second  --  or third or fourth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she spent most of her time at Bellegarde , only going down to London for the season . Thinks she knows how to run the place better than Lady Fontclair . Always telling her what to do  --  and Lady Fontclair , being the good soul she is , at least makes a pretence of listening . " " Did they quarrel  --  Lady Tarleton and Sir Bertrand ? "  | " They were always quarrelling . She used to ridicule him in front of people , making him out to be weak and craven . Which he was , there 's no denying it , or he would n't have let her ride herd over him that way . She was extravagant , too . He was plump in the pocket , Tarleton was , but she made quite a hole in his purse , and he could never make out what the money went for . I would n't put it past her to have spent it just to spite him . But there 's a streak of intemperance with money in the Fontclair family . You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , too . " " His name was Simon ? " " That 's right . First cousin to Sir Robert , and as unlike him as day is to night . Simon never could cut his coat according to the cloth . He was always trying to live like the fellows he knew who had ten times his income . He married a woman with no more sense than he had , and they hatched a grand scheme to make their fortune running a plantation in Barbados . But they made a hash of it . They came back poor as rats , with a baby daughter in tow . Lord knows how they managed after that . They lived in London , so I did n't see much of them . I expect they borrowed from Sir Robert . Though I 'm sorry to say , I would n't have put it past Simon to dabble in something  --  er ? " " Not altogether on the square ? " " It 's possible . They were none too scrupulous , Simon and Mrs. Simon . I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's just as well for Isabelle she came to live with Sir Robert and Lady Fontclair . " " I wonder if there 's anything in all this that might shed light on the murder . " " It 's ancient history , most of it . I do n't see what it could have to do with a crime that happened yesterday . " " Some crimes have their roots in events that happened decades , even centuries , ago . In Italy , where I lived for some time , quarrels often outlive the quarrellers , and are passed on to the next generation like so much family silver . Never mind , we 'll go back to my case against the Fontclairs . We 've talked about Guy already . He has no alibi for any of the period in question . My old room used to be his when he was a boy , and he was accustomed to getting in and out  | of it on the sly  --  although he used the window , which the murderer most likely did n't . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I do n't know if this means anything , but he went out last night in a violent rainstorm , and got into a funk when he was caught coming in at dawn . Again , no motive , though it 's tempting to speculate about a lover 's quarrel or a frustrated seduction . Though I do n't know why we should confine those sorts of suspicions to Guy . Colonel Fontclair is known to have a taste for game pullets  --  that is , for very young girls . " " Colonel Fontclair is an officer of the first water , a hero of the Peninsular War . " " In other words , he 's had a great success in the profession of killing . " " Killing a woman in cold blood is completely different from killing a man in battle ! " " I understand that . But the fact remains that a man who 's fought a long and gruesome war must be inured to taking human life in a way that the rest of us would n't be . Colonel Fontclair 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has no alibi for the period from half past four to five , when he went out riding . And the servants who saw him leave say he looked as if the devil were after him . " " He 's lame , " MacGregor pointed out . " He can walk . And he could easily overpower a small , slender girl . You know , we wondered how the killer made those smears of blood on the wall . A lame man would be particularly likely to lean against the wall for support . " MacGregor got up and paced about , running his hands through his hair . " You 'll have me believing anything before you 're through . See here , there are a thousand ways that blood might have been smeared on the wall . " " There 's something else . The evening before last , after dinner , Lady Tarleton brought me to see the gun room . We found the colonel and Lady Fontclair there . She had her arms around his shoulders . She was saying , ' It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it again . ' " MacGregor stared . " But ? but that could mean all manner of  | things ! You ca n't think he told her he was contemplating murder ! " " I do n't know what he told her . " " It might have been anything , " MacGregor urged . " They 've always got their heads together , those two . They 're great friends ? have been for years . He wanted to marry her once . " " Did he ? " " Now do n't go looking at me as if I 'd dug you up a buried treasure ! It 's no great matter . The colonel met her and paid court to her before Sir Robert did . He was a dashing young officer in those days , and broke a good many hearts . I do n't know if he ever got to the point of making her an offer . Sir Robert came along and fell over head and ears in love with her , and won her for himself . The colonel married Guy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all there is to it . " Julian wondered . He pictured the colonel and Lady Fontclair leaving the gun room arm in arm . Lady Tarleton 's insinuating voice rang in his ears : Touching , is n't it , how fond they are of one another ? " Look here , " said MacGregor , " when you said you could make a case against all the Fontclairs except Hugh , you ca n't have meant to include Lady Fontclair among your suspects ? " " Yes , I did . But we 'll pass over her if you 'd rather . " " No , let 's hear what you 've got to say . I 'd just as soon know the worst . " " You know , I like her , too . " " You do n't like anybody , and you do n't trust anybody ! " " I ca n't afford ? No , what 's the use ? " He rose . " Would you rather I put an end to this discussion , and this visit ? " " Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Not in so many words . " " Then sit down and behave yourself ! You ought to know better than to take to heart what I say when I 'm in a temper . " Julian smiled , and sat down again . " The case against Lady Fontclair . It 's not a strong one . If Sir Robert is telling the truth , he left her alone for only about a quarter of an hour during the period between half past four and six . She was n't entirely alone even for that short time : Miss Fontclair passed through the conservatory and  | spoke with her . There might just have been time for Lady Fontclair to let the girl in through the conservatory windows , bring her to my room , and kill her . But even assuming she could do it , it 's devilish hard to imagine that she would . " " Then why not rule her out ? " " Well , there are some disturbing facts . Lady Fontclair says you 've taught her a good deal about medicine  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That means she has some knowledge of anatomy , and probably is n't as squeamish as most of us would be about cutting into human flesh . And she must know the house and its routine better than anyone . It was most likely she who decided which room I would have . And she repeatedly urged Hugh to take me out for a long ride late yesterday afternoon . " " Clearing the way for her to kill the girl in your room while you were out ? Kestrel , I know her , the same as you know your servant . She would n't do a thing like that . I could imagine her firing a gun or raising a knife against  --  oh , say , a housebreaker who threatened her children . But , if nothing else , she 'd never plan a murder at Bellegarde , and take the risk that anyone in her family , or even any of her servants , would take the blame for it . " " This might not have been a planned crime . But I admit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What about Sir Robert ? Is he on your list of suspects ? " " Yes , but I grant you , the odds are Lombard Street to ninepence he had nothing to do with the murder . He has an alibi for most of the period in question  --  assuming he and Lady Fontclair are n't lying to shield each other . And , given his sense of right and justice , it 's devilish hard to imagine him committing a crime like this . What is n't so hard to imagine is that he thinks or fears one of his family is guilty . The question is , does he have a particular one in mind ? And how far would he go to protect that person ? " " I do n't like to think of the dilemma he 'd face if he thought the murderer was one of his own family . " " It may be worse than that , you know . " " How could it possibly be worse ? " " It may not be only one of them . Two or more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . "  | MacGregor clutched at his hair . " See here , Kestrel , is n't it just possible this is all the work of some aggrieved labourer attacking the local squire ? It happens , you know , though it has n't happened around Alderton for Lord knows how many years . " " I do n't know much about those sorts of rural conflicts , but would n't there have been a threatening note left behind  --  a demand for redress ? " " Well , probably . " MacGregor heaved a sigh and resumed his pacing . " Finally , there 's Miss Fontclair . There 's a good deal of circumstantial evidence against her . She admits to having passed close to my old room at about twenty minutes past five . She had her sketching box with her , which contains a small but very sharp knife that she uses to sharpen her pencils . She 's been very frank about all this . That may mean she has nothing to hide  --  it may also mean she 's trying to disarm us with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third possibility : she may be trying to draw suspicion away from someone else . " " Who ? " " I do n't know . " The most obvious person , he thought , would be Lady Fontclair , whom Isabelle said she had met in the conservatory when she came in through the French windows . But suppose Isabelle had been lying ? Suppose Lady Fontclair had not been in the conservatory while Sir Robert was gone ? Suppose that , instead of seeing her there , Isabelle had seen her a little while later , outside Julian 's room ? He went on , " Of course , as a suspect Miss Fontclair presents a number of problems . She was outdoors for the most of the time in which the girl could have been killed . She might have brought the girl in with her through the conservatory windows  --  but in that case , we have to posit some sort of conspiracy between her and Lady Fontclair , who says she came in alone . She might have let the girl in through the front door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at about that time . They might all have missed one another , but it seems farfetched . And there 's still the enigma of motive . Why the deuce would any of these people want the girl dead ?  | " Now for Mr. Craddock . He says he went for a walk in the Chase after his ride . He may have met the girl there  --  either by chance or by design  --  and arranged for her to join him at the house . He returns to Bellegarde and rings to be let in . Michael opens the door , then goes back to the servants ' hall , and Craddock goes up to his room . His window looks out on the front court , and he watches from there till he sees the girl coming , then he steals down the stairs and lets her in through the front door . He brings her to my room , remembering that I 've gone out , and knowing there wo n't be anyone else in that part of the house at that hour . But , again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No motive . " " Precisely . One thing I mean to find out is why he went for that walk in the Chase , and why Lady Tarleton was so upset about it . I 'd give a monkey to know more about the history between those two . " " That finishes your list of suspects . But when all 's said and done , whether you like it or not , your servant is still a pretty strong contender . " " I know . The devil take Dipper  --  why did he have to tell that lie ? " " Let 's hope it 's the only lie he told . " " It is , I promise you . Though I wonder ? " " Every time you say ' I wonder , ' I know there 's trouble brewing . What is it now ? " " Is it possible I 'm involved in the murder in some way I do n't understand ? It happened in my room . And I 've thought from the beginning it was odd I was invited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other . " " Then why did he ask you to be his best man ? " " He says he expected fireworks between his family and the Craddocks and thought I 'd be a moderating influence . The truth is , he mistook me for a knight out of Walter Scott , because I once fished him out of a scrape in a gaming hell . That 's one of the hazards of cutting a figure in London . I do n't mind fellows copying the cut of my coat or the way I turn a phrase , but I hate like the devil being hero-worshipped. "  | " It 's a big responsibility , having to live up to some young cub 's admiration . Much easier to fob people off with dandified airs and a fine suit of clothes . Give ' em something to dazzle their eyes , and maybe they wo n't try to find out what 's underneath it all . " He relented a little , seeing the young man 's startled face . " Touched you on the raw , have I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say what I think . The fact is , I ca n't stand waste , and it seems to me you 're squandering some fine gifts , leading the life you do . Why , with your intellects , you could be a barrister , a scholar  --  a doctor , when it comes to that . Would n't that be a better use of a mind like yours than thinking up new ways to tie a neckcloth or polish a pair of boots ? " " Possibly . But you see , I have no education . My father was a gentleman , but he married an actress , and his family cut him off with a shilling . I have no money to speak of , and no connexions . In our England , bless her heart , there 's no profession for a man like me . If I did n't dress extremely well , I 'd be invisible . " He rose . It was time he returned to Bellegarde ; he would be late to dinner as it was . He went out to the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just as he was leaving , MacGregor caught his arm . " Kestrel ! " " What is it ? " " Do n't you feel like Daniel setting off for the lions ' den , going back there ? If you really think one of the Fontclairs is a murderer , how can you sit down to dinner with them , sleep under their roof ? " " I do n't see that I have any choice . The investigation is centred at Bellegarde , and I want to be in the thick of it . Besides , I want to keep a close eye on the Fontclairs . Sooner or later the murderer 's mask will slip , even if by only an inch . I mean to be there when it does . " " Do you think whoever was brute enough to stab that slip of a girl in the back would think twice about doing you a mischief , if he thinks you 're on the brink of finding him out ? " " In that case , I may be safer at Bellegarde than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house would focus suspicion firmly and irrevocably on them . "  | " For God 's sake , man ! Do you want to be the next person found in somebody 's bed with a knife wound ? " It dawned on Julian that MacGregor was really concerned about him . He was touched . " My dear fellow , do n't worry . " " I 'm not worried , " grumbled MacGregor . " I just think you might be even more trouble dead than you are alive . "  | Next morning , the Bellegarde household went to church in Alderton . Some of the family , particularly the colonel and Lady Tarleton , did not want to appear in public so soon after the murder , but Sir Robert insisted . The Fontclairs must present a serene and confident face to the world , he said , both as a matter of pride and to allay worry in the village . Sunday services would be an excellent opportunity for them all to appear in public , and show they had nothing to fear or be ashamed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whispers rose . Heads turned ; parents hastily admonished their children not to point . Every eye followed the Fontclairs and their guests as they took their places in the family pew . The vicar was hard-pressed to get and keep the attention of his flock . He seemed unsure how openly he ought to refer to the murder . As he bade the congregation pray for the dead girl 's soul , he stole an uneasy glance at the Fontclairs , as though he feared to offend them by drawing attention to the scandal hanging over their house . No doubt he felt the need to keep in Sir Robert 's good graces ; it was most likely Sir Robert who had given him the living of Alderton . Yet if he really understood his patron , he would realize that no one would be more concerned than he that the dead girl have the benefit of everyone 's prayers . He himself would pray for her all the more  | fervently if he knew , or suspected , that one of his own family had killed her . Julian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the music , was surprised to find the service such a comfort . The old , sonorous words had tremendous power to soothe and inspire . At a time like this , faced with a difficult task and a fearful responsibility , he was grateful to lay aside his own will and feel strengthened and sustained by something outside himself . Some of his party were finding it hard to concentrate on the service , with the villagers gawking at them and murmuring behind their hands . Lady Tarleton seethed with frustration , for all her efforts to seem haughtily unconcerned . The colonel looked shamed and selfconscious . Guy was so restless he could barely keep his seat . Maud 's eyes were closed , her fingers tightly clasped and her head bent over them . Was she asking for guidance about whether to reveal the information she was holding back ? Julian suddenly knew beyond all doubt that she would tell it . She was too honest , too scrupulous , to keep it a secret much longer . Maud Craddock was a daughter-in-law after Sir Robert 's own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a luncheon of cold meats , jellies , and blancmange , at which Lady Tarleton was particularly ill-tempered , Julian went to visit Mrs. Warren . He had seen her in church that morning , and she seemed in a little better spirits than yesterday . After services , she had been beset by a crowd of villagers peppering her with questions about her mysterious lodger . Julian , seeing her trying vainly to fend them off , went and stood close by . While they turned to gaze at him with their usual fascination , Mrs. Warren scurried away . He set off for Alderton on horseback , skirting the south side of the park . For the murdered girl , this would certainly have been an easier route to Bellegarde than the Chase . The rough going there would have slowed her , and she could all too easily have gotten lost among the twisting paths . Her dirty , worn shoes and ripped skirt did suggest she had picked her way through woodland . On the other hand , those green stains round the hem of her skirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grass , not the undergrowth of a forest . Mrs. Warren lived in a small , square cottage of whitewashed brick , with a blue door and blue paint round the windows . The paint was peeling , the thatched roof was sparse in places , but the vegetable garden beside the house was lovingly tended . Round the house and garden ran a white picket fence . As Julian tethered his horse and approached the door , Mrs. Warren peeked out from between the curtains of a ground-floor window . She looked more apprehensive than pleased to see him . But she unbolted the door and let him in , nervously tucking stray wisps of hair under her cap . " I 'd have left the door open on such a fine day , but with a murderer loose in the neighbourhood , I 'm afeard to . Will they catch him soon , do you think , sir ? " " I 'm sure they will . The more they know about the victim , the easier it will be  --  which is why I 've come to try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chance you 've remembered something more since yesterday . " " I 'm sure I 'd be quick to tell it , if I had . Lawk-a-daisy me , I wish I was better at keeping things straight in my mind . " " I think you remember things very vividly , once your mind is jogged to focus on them . I have an idea . Why do n't I knock at the door , just as the girl did , and you let me in and act out for me everything that happened the night she arrived ? " " You mean like play-acting , sir ? " " Well , you need n't be another Mrs. Siddons . Just take me wherever you took her , and try if you can recall what the two of you talked about , and what you did . " She eyed him uncertainly , then nodded . " I 'll try it , sir . " He went out again and knocked . Mrs. Warren , on the other side of the door , said , " I heard her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who 's there ? ' And I heard a voice  --  high , like a little girl 's , with a funny accent  --  saying as how she 'd heard I had a room to let . I opened the door then , just a crack , " ? Mrs. Warren suited the action to the words ? " and looked at her . And then it was just as I told Sir Robert : I did n't like the look of her , so young and all alone and dressed so  | fine  --  but I needed the money so , I thought I 'd at least let her in and see what she had to say for herself . " She opened the door all the way , and Julian came in . " I took her into the kitchen first . " She opened a door on the right side of the central hallway . There was a door on the left side , too , and a stairway at the end of the hall . Probably there were only four rooms all told : two on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shabby but clean , with a big cooking pot suspended over the hearth , a broad deal table , and a walnut cabinet to hold the crockery . Utensils , scarred by years of scouring , hung along the walls , and a rocking chair with a big shawl draped across it stood by the fireplace . Mrs. Warren described how she had told the girl what lodging and meals would cost , and taken her upstairs to show her the room . She took Julian upstairs now . " That 's my room , sir , " she said , pointing to a door on one side of the hallway . " This was hers . " She opened a door opposite . The room was small and neat , with a bed , a table and chair , and an old chest to hold the lodger 's belongings . There were bright calico curtains at the windows , and a ballad , the kind sold at country fairs , pinned up on the wall . Julian examined the room . It was spotless . There was no sign that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Warren was too good a housewife  --  she had swept and scrubbed away any clue the girl might have left behind . He felt defeated . What was he doing here ? Why should he pester Mrs. Warren and waste his own time , when there was nothing new to learn ? Mrs. Warren repeated her account of how she had shown the girl the room , and the girl had looked out the window and asked where Bellegarde was . " Then she started unpacking of her things , and I went down to get the supper ready . We did n't talk at supper , and afterward she went upstairs and got ready for bed ? " She broke off . " Now , there you are , sir . That 's what comes of letting myself get so rattled as I 've been . I 'd forgot all about that until now . " " About what , Mrs. Warren ? " He kept his voice calm and steady . This was no time to alarm her with a show of eagerness . " When she put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gingambob she wore around her neck . Shaped like a scallop shell , it  | was , and made of silver . My , was n't she in a pother when she found it missing ! She come running downstairs in her nightdress , saying as how she 'd lost the most precious thing she had , and she had to find it straightaway . I asked her if it was worth a good deal , for it did cross my mind , sir , I might be accused of stealing it , and me not even knowing she had such a thing . She wore it underneath her dress , you see , so I had n't seen it afore . She said it had n't any value except to her . It was give to her by somebody she loved , who had to leave her when she was small . " " Did she say who that person was ? " " No , sir . I thought at first it was some love token , and said as much , but she got up on her high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't the kind to be ashamed of . How it was pure and dutiful . The love of a daughter . That was what she said . " " She used those words ? ' a daughter ' ? " " Yes , sir . So it might 've been a gift from her father or mother , but she did n't say clearly . She was half distracted , running about and wringing of her hands , and gabbling in her foreign tongue . And all the while she was looking everywhere for her trinket . It was all I could do to stop her running outdoors to see if she 'd lost it there , which would have been daft at that time of night . I said , ' Be patient , we 'll search the house from top to bottom , and happen we 'll find it . ' Which we did quite soon , sir , under her bed . The ribbon had broke , and the trinket must have fallen off and bounced under there without her knowing . " " Did she say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ? " " No , sir . I do n't even know if it was a man or a woman . But there was one more thing , now I think of it . She said she could n't bear to lose her trinket now , when they was going to meet again so soon  --  she and whoever give it to her . " " To meet again , " he repeated slowly . " Yes , sir . But she did n't say where or how , and I did n't want to know . It all sounded hugger-mugger to me . " " What happened after you found the scallop shell ? " " She kissed it , and held it against her heart . Whoever give it to her must have been all in all to her . She had gewgaws much finer , but I never saw her take on so about any of them . "  | " That reminds me : One of her earrings was missing when her body was found . Have you come across it anywhere ? " " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I 'd have turned it over to the law ? I would n't keep what is n't mine , sir ! " " I never thought you would , " he said hastily . " But considering what a strain you 've been under , a thing like that could easily have slipped your mind for a while . " " I did n't find no earbob , sir . What a one she was for losing things , to be sure ! " The girl had hung the scallop shell round her neck again , Mrs. Warren said , using a ribbon from her bonnet . She sewed the broken ribbon on her bonnet in its place . " Very skillful with her needle , she was . I never saw a hat trimmed quicker or prettier . " She had nothing more to tell him . Before he left , she shyly offered him a drink of her homemade cowslip wine . He accepted , although he did not think he would like it , and was right . He thanked her with real gratitude for all her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speculations . A silver scallop shell , given to the girl by someone for whom she felt a daughter 's devotion . Someone she had not seen in years , but expected soon to meet again . At Bellegarde ? If so , had she been killed to prevent her making contact with that person ? Or had she met her death at the hands of whomever it was she loved ? Julian rode to the village to visit Dipper , and to find out if Senderby had anything new to report . Alderton was quiet , seeing it was Sunday , but there were people , especially young couples , strolling up and down the main street . Julian 's presence created the usual stir . He was so accustomed to being stared at from a safe distance that it startled him when someone walked right up to him and spoke . " Mr. Kestrel , sir ! " " Mr. Felton . Good afternoon . " " It 's Dick , sir . How 's the investigation going ? Have you found out who did for the girl yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed . ' I read it in a book about a Bow Street Runner . Are they coming , sir , the Runners ? I 'd give anything to see one in the flesh ! "  | " The investigation is going tolerably well , we do n't know yet who committed the murder , ' did for ' has a certain vigour but I 'm rather partial to ' hushed ' or ' croaked , ' and as far as I know Sir Robert has no plans to call on the Bow Street Runners . " Felton gazed at him , round-eyed and respectful . " You are a downy one , sir . " " Thank you . You have n't remembered anything more about the murdered girl , by any chance ? " " No , sir . " Felton kicked a pebble moodily . " I hoped I would , so I could go back to squire 's house and see how the investigation was going  --  maybe even help out someways . Just wait till I 'm older , and I 've got a bit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , and join the Runners myself . That 's a life for a man , that is  --  not looking after other folks ' horses all day and half the night . " He glared at the Blue Lion across the way . " Are n't you too busy at your work to help in the investigation ? " " Why ? ? have you got something for me to do , sir ? Because I 've got a brother who 's a labourer and out of work , and he could take my place at the Lion for a few days , if I was needed to do important police work . " " I do n't know yet if you 'll be needed . If I gave you a task to perform on the quiet , could I trust you not to blow the gab by chaffing to your friends ? " Sometimes Dipper 's vocabulary had its uses . " I 'd be as silent as the grave , sir ! I would n't say one word , not if murderous cutthroats was to threaten to roast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't imagine it will come to that . But I 'm glad to know I can count on you if I need help  --  unofficially . " Felton assured him that he could count on him a hundred times over . By this time , he had made up his mind about Mr. Kestrel . He was a Bow Street Runner himself , decked out in an extraordinarily convincing disguise as a gentleman . Senderby had news . He had found someone who saw the girl on the day she died , after she left Mrs. Warren 's . " His name 's Fred  | Morley , and he 's the son of one of Sir Robert 's tenants , who works a farm south of Bellegarde . Fred was on his way to the horse fair early Friday morning . He took the main road to Whitford , and had just passed through Alderton when he saw her . " " What was she doing ? " " She was standing in the road , sir , talking to Bliss . He 's an old pedlar and beggar  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He comes through here every so often . Most likely it was the horse fair brought him this time . " " Yes . I saw him there . " He remembered the wizened old man , with his shabby clothes and colourful patchwork sack . " Oh , so you know who he is . Well , Fred says he saw Bliss talking to the girl and pointing down the road . He thought at first Bliss was pointing at him , but as he got closer it looked more like he was giving the girl directions . " " If he was pointing toward Morley , he must have been pointing east  --  toward Bellegarde . " " That 's right , sir . " " Did he hear anything they said ? " " No , sir . When he got close to them , the girl saw him and took fright . Leastways , she hurried away from the road , and Bliss stood looking from her to Fred , like he was n't sure what to do next . " " What happened then ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did wonder who the girl was , out all alone dressed in such fine clothes , and talking to the likes of Bliss . But he was in a hurry to get to the horse fair , and he was afeard that if he stopped , Bliss would beg from him or try to sell him something he did n't want . So he rode on past the girl and Bliss , and that was all he saw of them . " " I suppose the next step is to question Bliss . " " Easier said nor done , sir . No one 's seen him since Friday morning , when he was hawking his wares at the horse fair . He was probably on his way there when the girl asked him for directions . I do n't s'pose there 'll be much he can tell us about her , which is just as well , because it may take a bit of doing to find him . If he left these parts on Friday after the horse fair , there 's no knowing where he 's got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ route he usually follows ? " " He goes wherever there 's fairs or weddings , or any kind of do where folks are likely to be openhanded with their money . I 'm just on my way to report to Sir Robert , and with his leave I 'll start an enquiry after Bliss . I expect he 'll turn up fast enough if he hears there 's a reward for information about the girl . There 's not much he wo n't do if there 's money in it , and no great risk to be run . " " Does he have any usual haunts in the neighbourhood where you could look for him ? " " We 'd know if he was anywhere near Alderton , sir . He do n't make any secret of his presence . Contrariways , he 's always begging off folks or pestering them to buy his wares . I 'll look in at the old mill , though , after I 've seen Sir Robert . That 's where Bliss mostly sleeps when he 's in the neighbourhood . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northwest of Alderton ? " Julian recalled seeing it yesterday when he emerged from the Chase . " That 's right , sir . We have n't used it since the new mill was built , and it 's fallen into a sorry state . The parish keeps meaning to pull it down , but somehow we have n't got round to it , and in the meantime gipsies and such like use it now and again . " " Has anyone been staying there lately ? " " Not so far as I know . Unless Bliss slept there the night before the horse fair . " It occurred to Julian that , while Senderby was making his report to Sir Robert , he could go to the old mill himself and have a look around . He supposed he ought to tell Senderby what he intended , but he did not . If he learned anything of interest , he could always let Sir Robert know about it afterward . The truth was , he was repenting of his promise to share his discoveries with Sir Robert . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his instincts were to play a lone hand whenever possible . If that meant practising a secrecy inconsistent with his honour , so be it . * Before he left Alderton , Julian looked in on Dipper , who was now sharing his cramped , unwholesome quarters with a sheep-  | stealer . They appeared to be getting on famously . Dipper regarded the sheep-stealer with great respect and curiosity . He himself had never stolen anything larger than a pocketbook , much less alive . Leaving his horse at the Blue Lion , Julian set out on foot for the old mill . It was going to rain . The air felt thick and sluggish , and a dead white haze was slowly but surely blotting out the sun . If he 'd had any sense , he thought , he would have changed out of the clothes he had worn to church . A coat moulded to his figure like a glove , a high shirt collar , and a starched neckcloth were not the best attire for tramping about on a rainy day , exploring abandoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to the stream that ran parallel to it . Here the grass grew in lush profusion , springing up in clumps like shocks of hair . He found the footbridge he had crossed yesterday . On the other side of the stream was the old mill , its weatherboarding decrepit , its sack-hoists serving now as perches for fat pigeons . Inside , the mill was cool and musty . The windows did not let in much light , but cracks in the weatherboarding and roof helped relieve the dimness . As his eyes adjusted , he made out an expanse of bare floor and , off to one side , a partly enclosed area where the wheels and machinery were . The floor was coated with grime . Some of the boards were loose , with damp earth oozing through the gaps . The walls were dirty , too , and strewn with spiders ' webs . A throaty , monotonous murmur above his head told him the upper story had been taken over by the pigeons . He was careful where he walked , because he did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was full of footprints . Most were too blurred for him to make out their shape , but he thought there were at least two pairs of feet , one much larger than the other . Several floorboards had been pulled up and laid aside . On the exposed earth was a circle of stones , enclosing a pile of ashes and blackened bits of wood . Julian took off his gloves and felt the ashes ; they were cold . The fire had probably been built within the past few days , but there was no telling exactly when . Someone had slept by it , too , leaving a long smudge in the dirt on the floor .  | He continued exploring . Along one wall , he found a great many footprints leading nowhere , overlaid on one another so that he could not make out their size or shape . It looked as if someone had been pacing up and down along the wall , probably for some time . At one end , this trail of footprints gave way to one large smear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his or her back against the wall , most likely , since there was a smudge there , too . It was a godsend that the place was so filthy : positions and movements showed as clearly as they would in newly fallen snow . But what could he deduce from all this ? Only that someone , probably Bliss , had slept here during the past few days , and that at least one other person had been here as well . Then he saw it  --  the gleam of metal through a gap between the floor and the wall . He pried a floorboard loose and thrust his hand underneath . His fingers closed round a small , cold object . It was a gold teardrop earring , set with an aquamarine . So the murdered girl had been here . It was most likely she who had paced this trail and sat against this wall . He recalled that the seat of her dress and the back of her shawl had been stained with dirt . He took out his quizzing glass and closely examined the place where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught in a splinter of wood in the wall was one long red-gold hair . He removed the hair carefully , wrapped both it and the earring in his handkerchief , and put the handkerchief away in his pocket . Before he left the mill , he considered going up to have a look at the first floor . But the stairs were half rotted away , and the cobwebs draped across them showed that no one had used them for a long time . He decided with relief that he could leave the pigeons undisturbed . He came out of the mill , shading his eyes against the sunlight . Why had the girl come here ? he wondered . Was this where she was going when she left Mrs. Warren 's in the morning ? He did not think so . When Bliss was seen giving her directions , he had been pointing east toward Alderton and Bellegarde , not north toward the stream and the mill . The stretch of road where Fred Morley had seen her with Bliss was very near here . Morley had said she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming ; she might have found the mill and taken refuge there . The luxuriant grass by the stream could have made the green stains round the hem of her skirt . And the mill was very near the Chase , through which she could have walked to Bellegarde . But if she were so eager to get to Bellegarde , why did she go into the mill , pace the floor , sit huddled against the wall ? Was she waiting for something  --  the right time , a message , a companion ? Perhaps she had not found the mill herself . Bliss might have shown her the way . Morley had not known whether Bliss remained with her after he passed by . Of course , Bliss had been at the horse fair later that morning , but he could have brought the girl to the mill first . If so , it might have been he who showed her how to reach Bellegarde through the Chase . Everyone said he would do anything for money , and the girl evidently had the means to pay him well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Alderton since the horse fair . He might have known , or suspected , that the girl was up to no good , and thought it prudent to disappear before anyone found out he had helped her . He might be all the more anxious to hide his connexion with her if he knew she had been murdered . Or would he have come forward with information , in order to collect the reward ? It was all speculation . Only one thing was clear . Bliss must be found , and soon .  | On his way back to Bellegarde , Julian debated whether to tell Sir Robert about his discoveries at the old mill . If he were caught concealing evidence , he would be excluded from the investigation ? perhaps even suspected of complicity in the crime . Yet he was still in two minds as he went upstairs to his room to dress for dinner . A sharp-nosed girl was hovering in wait for him at the top of the stairs . " Please you , sir , I 'm Miss Craddock 's maid . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , and ask if you 'd be good enough to meet her in the music room . " Julian thanked her and went back downstairs . He could tell by her sly smile that she thought there was a hole-in-corner love affair brewing between him and Miss Craddock . Hugh had all too clearly jumped to the same conclusion . That was awkward , but perhaps not such a bad thing for Miss Craddock . A romantic like Hugh would not be disposed to fall in love with a girl who was thrust on him unsought and unwanted . He would expect to woo his beloved , fight for her , struggle against obstacles to win her . And there was no denying a rival made a very good obstacle . He found Miss Craddock walking about the music room , twisting and untwisting her fingers . " I hope you did n't mind my asking Alice to watch for you . I thought you 'd be willing to meet me here , when you knew what I had to say . "  | " I should be willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say at all . " " You 're so kind to me , and I 've tried your patience so sorely ! ? keeping a secret from you that might possibly have something to do with the murder . I told you I 'd think hard what I ought to do , and I have thought . I 've made up my mind . I 'm going to tell you everything . " A maddening scruple forced him to say , " You know , my involvement in the investigation is  --  unofficial . Strictly speaking , you ought to make your statement to Sir Robert . " " I thought of that . But you see , what I have to say is about his sister  --  where she was at the time of the murder . And they 're so loyal to each other , all the Fontclairs . I think Sir Robert means to do right , but I do n't see how he can be impartial . I 'm sorry to say this about Hugh 's father , but I just do n't trust him . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , then . " They sat together on the sofa . She confessed , " I left something out of the statement I made to Sir Robert about what I did on the afternoon of the murder . It 's true I went on a botany outing with Miss Pritchard and Josie and Pippa . But what I did n't say is that when I came back , at about a quarter to six , I went to Papa 's room . I wanted to ask him if I could invite Miss Pritchard to London for a holiday . I was just about to knock on his door when I heard voices inside . Mr. Kestrel , Lady Tarleton was in there with him . She was n't telling the truth when she said she was in her room all afternoon . " " Do you know what she was doing there ? " " She was quarrelling with Papa . I 'm afraid I listened at the door . I did n't mean to , but I was so startled to hear her voice . She was saying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for more than twenty years . ' " Their eyes met , full of foreboding . " Did he say anything in reply ? " " They both said something , but I was so flustered , I did n't hear it distinctly . I was just going to move away from the door , when suddenly Papa shouted at her . It was terrible ! He said there was no truth in her  --  just a monstrous , swollen pride that devoured every-  | thing in its path . He said her reputation was everything to her : there was nothing she would n't sacrifice for it , and they both knew it . And then he said , Do you know what you are , the whole lot of you Fontclairs ? You 're like one of those fruits that looks ripe and shining on the outside , while the inside is rotten and stinking . I only wish the rest of the world could have seen what I saw when I came in and found you ? ' " But I do n't know where he found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough ! ' She warned him to keep his voice down . She said she could n't bear any more . Then she said , ' If you say anything to anyone about this ? ! You may think I 've been making empty threats , but you little know  --  you ca n't begin to understand  --  how much I hate you . You think I wo n't dare to betray you . Well , we 'll see , Mr. Craddock ! We 'll see ! ' " Maud came out of her trance of memory with a gasp and pressed her hand to her mouth . Julian took her other hand and held it in both of his . " Did they say anything else ? " " I do n't know . I heard her coming toward the door , and I ran away . I shut myself in my room . My head was whirling . All I could think was that Papa must know something shameful about Lady Tarleton  --  whatever it is she 's been regretting for more than twenty years . Perhaps that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads . But why was he so angry and upset with her ? And what was she threatening to betray him about ? " All I could think of was to talk to you . You know the world better than I do . You might understand what that conversation meant . I came looking for you when you got home , but you 'd already gone up to dress . Then after the murder , when I told Papa what I 'd overheard , he said I must n't tell anyone . He said I 'd get the Fontclairs into terrible trouble if I did . I felt so bewildered ! I did n't want to hurt the Fontclairs , or expose Papa for a liar . And I was afraid ? just a little  --  that his quarrel with Lady Tarleton did have something to do with the murder , even though he said it did n't . Oh , not that I think for a moment ? Mr. Kestrel , Papa would n't kill anyone ! At least , he might kill a man who attacked him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been much older than I am . " " I understand . " But he was thinking of all the debtors Craddock  | had driven into prison  --  all the rivals in business he had destroyed . Would a man like that stop at cold-blooded murder ? " In the end I had to tell you , " she finished . " I kept thinking about what you said  --  that there was no knowing what might be important to the investigation . I thought , suppose some innocent man were hanged for want of information I knew that could have saved him ? I 'd never forgive myself . " " You 've done the right thing . I promise you , I 'll hold what you 've told me in the strictest confidence , and reveal it only to the extent I must . But I may have to confront Lady Tarleton with it , in order to get the truth from her about where she went and what she did on the afternoon of the murder . " " What if she wo n't tell you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall give her no peace under heaven until she does . " While he dressed for dinner , Julian thought over all he had found out today , from his visit to Mrs. Warren to his conversation with Maud . He felt as though he were sorting swiftly through the contents of a desk , taking papers out of first one drawer and then another , comparing , rearranging , looking for patterns and inconsistencies . He recalled with sharpened interest the family history Guy had recounted to him on the night before the murder . And a theory took shape in his mind that , amazingly , fit all the facts . It might not be true , but it gave him something to work with ? a tool , or a weapon . Of course , even to hint his suspicions to Lady Tarleton would be like putting fire to powder . But if he had to set off an explosion to get the truth from her , he would . He had no chance to speak to her alone till after dinner , when the gentlemen joined the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a window recess , and he followed her there . He kept his voice low but did not whisper ; whispering only attracted attention . " Lady Tarleton , I have something very important to speak to you about . Will you come with me to another room ? the library , perhaps ? " " Of all the effrontery ! No , I will not come with you , Mr. Kestrel !  | I ) o you think I 'm a lackey , to go hither and yon at your pleasure ? " " I thought you might rather talk in private . But if you prefer , I 'll tell you here and now what I have to say . " " I do n't want to know what you have to say ! " she hissed . " I 'm afraid you have no choice . I want to know what you were doing in Mr. Craddock 's room on the afternoon of the murder . And , by God , I will have an answer . " She gasped . Her hands found their way to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed her eyes and nodded jerkily . He took up a small candelabrum , and they went out . The library was dark and silent . Julian set his candles on a table and turned to face Lady Tarleton . She lifted her chin and demanded , " What makes you think I was in that man 's room ? " " I know you were . " " If Mr. Craddock told you that , he was lying . And Robert will take my word against his , you 'll see . " " It was n't Mr. Craddock who told me . It was someone who overheard your conversation with him . " " No ! " She flung herself at him , all but tore the lapels off his coat . " Who overheard us ? What have you found out ? " " Only that you were in Mr. Craddock 's room , and the two of you quarrelled . I do n't know what it was about  --  I was hoping you could explain ? " She hung on him , staring into his face with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know  --  you have n't found out ? " He gently loosed her hands from his lapels and guided her to a chair . " May I get you some water  --  or wine , perhaps ? " " I do n't want anything . Except an explanation ! Why are you putting me through this horror ? What do you want from me ? " " The same thing I want from everyone in the house : a true account of your movements on the afternoon of the murder . You said you never left your room . I know now that you did . I should like to know when you left it , whether you went anywhere besides Mr. Craddock 's room , how long you were in his room , and why you went there . " " Why I went there is nothing to you ! "  | " If it has any bearing on the murder " It has n't ! " " I ca n't know that for certain till you tell me . " She threw back her head . " Find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you nothing . I was in Mr. Craddock 's room  --  very well . Why do n't you ask your mysterious informant what I was doing there ? I do n't believe your informant knows anything , and I do n't believe you do , either . Do your worst ! Tell Robert  --  tell everyone ! You wo n't get a word out of me . But when all this is over  --  when your brute of a servant 's been convicted and hanged  --  then I shall do plenty of talking ! I shall make it known all over London how you tried to fasten his guilt on one of us . And that will be the end of you , Mr. Kestrel ! You 'll be driven out of good society  --  even servants will cut you dead ! " He had no one to blame but himself , he thought . Because she was a woman , and so distraught , he had been too soft with her ? reasoned when he should have insisted . She had the whip hand now , and he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , beating down his chivalrous instincts . " If you wo n't tell me what I need to know , " he said , " I shall have to draw my own conclusions . And when I take this up with Sir Robert , I shall tell him what those conclusions are . " " What do you mean ? What conclusions ? " " This investigation is like putting together a Chinese puzzle . You have an assortment of odd facts , and you try to arrange them in a pattern . That 's what I 've done . It may be all wrong from beginning to end , but it 's the only pattern I can find . A young lady , a foreigner , turned up in Alderton three days ago . She must have been about twenty years old . Her hair was reddish , and her eyes were blue . " He had been walking about as he spoke , but now he stopped and fixed his gaze on her . Her red hair was straggling down from its chignon . Her blue eyes stared into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she asked Mrs. Warren where Bellegarde was . And she told Mrs. Warren she would soon be meeting again someone she was devoted to  --  someone who had to leave her when she was very young . It was that person who gave her the  | silver scallop shell she wore around her neck  --  the trinket you were so reluctant to touch . " Suppose for the sake of argument that the person she looked forward to seeing again was at Bellegarde . And suppose that person was  --  her mother . " Lady Tarleton was rigid . A muscle near her mouth twitched . Her hands clenched into fists . Now some family history . Mr. Craddock was a groom at Bellegarde some twenty years ago . You were a fierce and venturesome rider . If Craddock was the groom you took on your rides , you could have been alone with him for long periods of time , far from Bellegarde . " At some point you demanded that Sir Robert dismiss him . No one seems to know why . Craddock is still in a passion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest . But you feel something more , too  --  guilt , and bitter regret . You said to him , ' I have scourged myself for that for more than twenty years . ' " One other significant fact . As a girl , you made a trip to the Continent against your family 's wishes . You took advantage of a lull in the wars with France , which must have been the Peace of Amiens . That was in 1802 ? some two-and-twenty years ago . " " What  --  what are you implying ? " " Did you leave a daughter behind you in France , Lady Tarleton ? " She shot up from her chair and struck him in the face . He barely blinked . " I take it you prefer not to answer . " " How dare you ! How dare you ! No ! It is n't true ! That wretched girl was not my daughter ! How could you think such a thing ? " She staggered away from him , shaking violently . " You 've stumbled on w piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Craddock , in his unparalleled effrontery , once sought to put his hands on me . We were riding together in the Chase , and I 'd dismounted in a small t learing  --  yes , Mr. Kestrel , the clearing he was taunting me with the other night ! He tried to take liberties  --  he , a servant I 'd trusted to ride with me alone , to whom I 'd shown all manner of favour , far beyond his deserts ! I escaped from his repulsive advances and rode home and told Robert what he had done . Robert very properly  | discharged him at once . For the sake of my reputation , we said nothing in public about the reasons for his dismissal . To have it known that a creature like Craddock had so much as lifted a hand to touch me would have soiled me forever . A mere groom ! The refuse of a stable ! And I a Fontclair ! " Of course Mr. Craddock has never forgiven us . He was so puffed up with pride , he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and me . He actually thought I might return his feelings ! You ought to have seen him  --  swaggering , boastful , proud  --  thinking that because servant girls fell into his arms , Catherine Fontclair might do the same ! I soon disabused him of that notion ! But he 's hated me and my brother all these years , and now fate 's given him a chance to take revenge . He means to marry his mouse of a daughter to Hugh  --  to mingle his blood with ours . There 's nothing I would n't do to stop him  --  nothing ! That 's why I went to his room . Nothing else could have brought me to set foot there , and take the chance I might have to confront him alone . I knew he was out riding , and I hoped to be gone before he returned , but I was n't so lucky . He came back and found me . " " What did you hope to gain by going to his room ? " " I 've got to tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll just keep digging , probing , ransacking us for guilty secrets ? No ! I wo n't let you humiliate me any longer ! You thought I 'd given myself to a groom and borne him a child . Perhaps you even thought I murdered that child to keep my shame a secret . Well , you were wrong ! It is n't I who 've brought our family to the brink of disgrace and put us in Craddock 's power . Geoffrey  --  Geoffrey is the criminal in our midst ! And not just a murderer , Mr. Kestrel . Murderers are only hanged . Traitors are drawn and quartered , and their property taken by the Crown . That 's what would happen to Geoffrey if we did n't conspire with Craddock to hide his guilt . And but for the dishonour it would bring on our name , I could see it happen and not even shed a tear ! "  | " Colonel Fontclair committed treason ? " Julian said dazedly . It was during the Peninsular campaign . " Lady Tarleton sat down and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course you know he served under Wellington in Portugal and Spain . i le was decorated many times for bravery in the field . Until a few months ago , we were all proud of his achievements . We thought he was a worthy successor to the military heroes who 've borne our name . " What we did n't know was that he 'd been ensnared by a Bonapartist spy  --  a creature named Gabrielle Deschamps . He met her *tier the siege of Badajoz . She was hiding in a church  --  of all places ! ? and he took her under his protection . A pity there was no one to protect him from her ! By the time the army moved on , Geoffrey fancied himself in love with her . He saw her whenever and wherever he could . And he wrote her letters , some half a dozen of them . I do n't know what they said ; none of us has seen them . But they passed information to her  --  information she sold to the French army ! He gave aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Kestrel ! Just to keep some harlot 's favours ! Was there ever anything to contemptible ? I can hardly believe he could be my brother , and a Fontclair ! He thought his treachery would never be discovered . He lost  | track of the woman after he was invalided out , and for a dozen years he heard no more of her . But there 's such a thing as retribution , Mr. Kestrel , and God saw fit to visit it on all of us , as well as on him who earned it . This past April , just after Hugh 's coming of age , Craddock came to Bellegarde and demanded to speak with Geoffrey , Robert , and me . He 'd got hold of Geoffrey 's letters and threatened to make them public , unless Robert agreed to a marriage between Hugh and Craddock 's daughter . " A pretty revenge , was it not ? I had scorned him years ago ; now he would marry his daughter to my nephew  --  make her mother to the next generation of Fontclairs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Geoffrey 'd disgraced us all ! We 'd always been so proud of our ancestors ' military glories , and now to fall so low ! It amazes me Geoffrey still lives . If he had a vestige of honour left , he would put an end to himself rather than bear the remorse and humiliation . But he held on to his worthless life  --  more than that , he begged Robert to accede to Craddock 's demands , to save him from disgrace and prosecution . Of course Robert agreed  --  not for Geoffrey 's sake , I trust , but to protect our family honour and pass on a spotless name to our descendants . " Julian recalled how , on his first evening at Bellegarde , Geoffrey had bolted from the drawing room on hearing Lady Tarleton talk of their ancestors ' military exploits . No wonder . Her every word had been a reproach , pointing up the contrast between their past glories and his own looming disgrace . " But how did Colonel Font-clair 's letters end up in Craddock 's hands ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call Nemesis . One of Mr. Craddock 's loathsome business interests is a string of pawnshops he owns in the City . He was visiting one of them when he found a woman 's jewelry casket , of black and gold japan work . Whoever pawned it had n't redeemed it , and the man who manages the shop for Craddock had put it out for sale . Craddock had a fancy to give it to his daughter . While examining it , he discovered it had a false bottom . He looked underneath it  --  and there he found the letters . At all events , that 's the story he told us . " " Did the jewelry box belong to this woman Gabrielle Deschamps ? "  | " I have no idea . Geoffrey says he does n't remember her having such a box , but why we should believe anything Geoffrey says is more than I can conceive . " " Who pawned the box ? " " We do n't know . " " But do n't you want to find out ? If it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England . Colonel Fontclair could buy Mr. Craddock 's silence , only to face a new threat of blackmail from her . " " We thought of that . We 're not fools , Mr. Kestrel . We asked ( : raddock who pawned the box , but he said the pawnbroker did n't know . The stupid fellow remembered nothing about the transaction at all . " " But pawnbrokers are required by law to keep the name and address of everyone who pawns goods with them . " " Well , this pawnbroker had lost the name and address of whoever pawned the box . Or so Craddock said . We could n't very well go and question the man ourselves . We did n't dare let it be known we had any interest in the box or the person who pawned it . I should n't think it was the Deschamps woman . Why would she have pawned it with the letters inside ? They were valuable  --  she could have sold them to Geoffrey for a high price . Most likely she 's dead , or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the hands of someone who either did n't know the letters were there or did n't think them of any importance . But when Craddock read them , he realized what they could be worth , and how he could use them against us . " Now do you understand why I went to his room while he was out ? I was looking for those miserable letters . I hoped against hope he might have brought them with him to Bellegarde . I waited in my room till nearly five o'clock , when I was sure all the servants would be at dinner , then I crept into his room and searched it . Repulsive though it was to touch his clothes , his shaving things , his bed linen  --  I searched everywhere . If I could only get those letters away from him , his hold over us would be broken . We could throw him out of Bellegarde as we did years ago , and his daughter with him . " Now I 'll tell you about my embroidery scissors  --  it 's fascinated  | you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor of Craddock 's room . I tried to open it , but it was locked . I was convinced the letters were in it , and it maddened me that I could n't get at them . I tried to drag it away with me , but it was too heavy . Then I tried to pick the lock , using one of the blades of my embroidery scissors , but that did n't work . Finally I jabbed at the lid with the scissors , trying to prise it open . That 's how I cut my finger . And just at that moment Craddock came in ! Only conceive of my humiliation ! To be caught in his room like that , searching his things ! " Her story rang true , thought Julian . The scratches on the scissors could well have been made by poking the blades inside a lock or under the rim of a strongbox . And it was easy to imagine her making such a frenzied attack on the strongbox that she cut her finger . He saw why she had lied : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught her searching his room , but she would have had to explain what she was looking for , and the story of Colonel Font-clair 's letters would have had to come out . Craddock had supported her lies in order to keep his hold on the Fontclairs  --  for a black-mailer 's power vanishes once the secret he knows is made public . Craddock and the Fontclairs had different motives , but their goal was the same : to keep Geoffrey 's misconduct hidden at all costs . " Craddock came in from riding at twenty minutes past five , " he said , " and , according to my informant , you were still in his room half an hour later . Were you quarrelling all that time ? " " Who is this informant of yours ? " " I should rather keep  --  him or her  --  out of this . " " Some skulking servant , no doubt . If I ever find out who it was , I shall have the wretch dismissed without a character . Listening at keyholes ! " " Lady Tarleton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've been regretting for more than twenty years ? " She looked at him sharply , warily . After a moment she said , " I 've always wished I 'd had Craddock punished for trying to take liberties with me . But Robert and I were anxious to protect my reputation . Of course I was blameless , but there might have been a scandal all the same . Malicious people might have said I 'd encouraged Craddock  | somehow . So Robert gave him a reference and wages in lieu of notice in exchange for his promise not to make known why he was turned out of Bellegarde . But afterward I was sorry we 'd been so lenient with him . He  --  he practically tried to assault me . We ought to have had him arrested . That 's what I 've regretted all these years . " Julian frowned over this but made no comment . " In your quarrel with Craddock , you threatened to betray him about something , if he revealed something about you . What was all that about ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd caught me searching his room . I was mortified enough without their knowing . I said ? I threatened to make public that he was blackmailing us with Geof-frey 's letters . He did n't believe I would do it . He knew I did n't want Geoffrey 's disgrace to come out . " Her eyes narrowed . " What else did your spy hear us say ? " " Mr. Craddock said you would sacrifice anything for the sake of your reputation . And he said he wished the rest of the world could have seen what he saw when he came in and found you  --  where ? " " In his room , trying to open his strongbox , " she said impatiently . " Where did you think he meant ? In your room , murdering that girl ? " That was the crux of the problem , he thought ruefully . What , if anything , did all this have to do with the murder ? Well , at least he knew at long last how Craddock had bent the Fontclairs to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a link between blackmail and murder , both Geoffrey Fontclair and Mark Craddock had a good deal of explaining to do . * On returning to the drawing room , Julian asked to speak with Sir Robert in private . They retired to the small study at the back of the main house where , two nights ago , the household had filed by to look at the murdered girl . Julian wondered if anyone would ever care to sit on that sofa again . " Senderby was here this afternoon , " said Sir Robert . " He told me Morley 's story about seeing Bliss with the murdered girl . He said you already knew about that . "  | " Yes . Has Bliss been found yet ? " " No . One of the special constables is making enquiries . It should n't be difficult to find him . He 's too old and has n't the means to travel quickly , and he stops often along the way to beg and hawk his wares . But I should n't think he 'd have much to contribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl only briefly , to give her directions on the road . " Julian thought of the girl 's earring and the strand of her hair , which he had wrapped in paper and buried in a container of toothpowder in his dressing-case . Those clues certainly suggested that there had been more than a casual connexion between the girl and Bliss . But he could not bring himself to tell Sir Robert about his investigation at the old mill . " It was n't Morley 's story I wanted to speak to you about , " he said . " I 'm sorry to bring up a subject that must be extremely painful to you , but Lady Tarleton 's told me about Colonel Fontclair 's let-ters . " He repeated her account of Craddock 's blackmail scheme , and of her attempt to break open his strongbox . Sir Robert heard him out with surprising calm . " It 's something of a relief that you know , " he said quietly . " We 've been finding it harder and harder to keep Geoffrey 's secret from you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murder as a punishment for hiding his guilt . Just when we most wish to escape notice , the investigation 's shone a beacon on us , lighting up our every movement , thought , and feeling . It 's making a mockery of our secrecy , and Craddock 's threats . Mr. Kestrel , my brother is a criminal , and I am a magistrate . My concealment of his crime is indefensible . If you choose to reveal it , you 'll be acting as a British subject should , and I  --  I shall be the first to commend you for it ! " Julian thought : What must it cost a man like this to lie for his brother , to give in to the blackmail of a former servant , to suppress information that might be needed to apprehend a murderer ? No doubt he 's acting in part out of a desire to save his brother 's skin , but what really drives him is honour  --  the need to protect the name he cherishes . He has his ancestors to think of , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than his sense of justice .  |p22I  He said , " The only crime that concerns me is the murder here two days ago . If Colonel Fontclair 's letters have nothing to do with that , then I count them no business of mine . " " Do you think the murder and this matter of the letters are linked ? " " Very possibly . Have you asked your brother and Mr. Craddock whether the girl might be connected somehow to Gabrielle Deschamps , or the letters ? " " I have n't asked them specifically , no . I 'm afraid I 've tended to shun the very idea . " " I understand . But I think we ought to ask them now . " " And you are quite right , of course . " Sir Robert pulled the bellrope , and sent a servant to ask Colonel Fontclair to join them . " Mr. Kestrel , I do n't believe my brother had anything to do with that girl 's death . For all his prowess in battle , he is n't cruel or brutal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weakness . About Mr. Craddock , I ca n't be certain . But I promise you this : If it transpires that the murder is linked in any way to my brother 's misconduct , nothing on earth will prevail upon me to keep it hidden any longer . I 've already cheated justice by conspiring to suppress the letters . Further than that , I can not go . " * " I wish I could explain to you what she was like ! " Geoffrey waved his hands helplessly . " She could make a man do anything . It was like  --  like being bewitched . She could torment a fellow until he went out of his senses . You could never be sure of her . Even when she was in my arms , she always seemed somewhere far away . Laughing at me , maybe . Thinking of someone else . " It was partly that campaign . It wore down the hardiest of us . It went on for years , one skirmish after another , and one day we 'd have the advantage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was stifling , the terrain was rough , supplies were hard to come by . The Spanish were like wild animals , and our troops not much better . I was bored and restless . But in the end , it was that woman . I 've never known another who could do to me what she did .  | " I never told her anything important . It was n't as though I sold my own men , gave them up to the French ! Little things , that 's all I told her ! Things the French probably knew about anyway . I did n't see her for long stretches at a time , and when I was n't with her , I worried about her being with other men . I was crazed with jealousy . I had an idea she 'd be faithful to me if I kept her supplied with information . I did n't tell her anything of consequence , you 've got to believe me ! But those letters  --  I have a feeling they 'd look pretty bad if they came to light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were pinched with distaste . He had obviously heard all this before . " Neither Mr. Kestrel nor I is interested in your explanations . What we wish to know is whether your letters might have any bearing on the murder . " " I do n't see how they could . " " You ca n't think of any reason to connect the girl with Mademoiselle Deschamps ? " said Julian . " What reason could there be ? " " The girl was foreign . She could have been a relation , or a ser-vant . " " I would n't know about that , " Geoffrey muttered . " When did you last hear from her ? Mademoiselle Deschamps , I mean . " " I lost track of her after the French were driven back over the Pyrenees . I was wounded and sent back to England at about that time . Gabrielle might have been killed  --  a lot of the French in Spain were . But she might have escaped to France . I never heard anything more about her . I 'd all but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he had my letters . " " Did n't you ever wonder what became of them ? " asked Julian . " I tried not to think about it . It would be like Gabrielle to keep them . She 'd never let anything slip through her fingers that might be turned into money . But how the letters got in that jewelry box , I 'm damned if I know . " Julian considered . " If Gabrielle died , who would be likely to inherit her possessions ? " " I do n't know . " " Did she ever mention any family ? "  | o she 's told you about the letters , has she ? " said Craddock to Julian . " I do n't know what she expected to gain by it . Maybe she thought by putting me in a bad light she could implicate me in the murder . But she 'll pay a high price , if this business of the letters is made public . The Fontclairs can call off the marriage , but that 'll be small comfort to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't realize she hated me so much she 'd sacrifice her own brother to spite me . " Julian said , " That seems no more strange than that you should sacrifice your own daughter to spite her . " " What do you mean by that ? " Craddock said sharply . " I mean that , whatever wrongs the Fontclairs may have done you , Miss Craddock is innocent , and I think she deserves better than to he used by her own father as an instrument of revenge . " " Do n't meddle in matters that are n't your concern , boy ! I wo n't stand for it . I know what your game is : you want to scuttle the marriage between my daughter and Hugh Fontclair , so you can get Maud and her hundred thousand pounds for yourself . You 've been making up to her ever since you got here  --  do n't think I have n't seen it . Well , you 'd better know one thing at the outset , and I 'll tell Maud the same : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she marries any man but Hugh Fontclair. "  | " My dear sir , I have no designs on either your ducats or your daughter . But I have a very high regard for Miss Craddock , and I wo n't stand by and see her delivered up to an unwilling bridegroom , with a taint of blackmail on her that will poison her relations with him and his family for the rest of her life . " " I did n't force her to accept him ! She made that choice . " " She was choosing in the dark . She did n't know what was at stake  --  how much harm she might do the Fontclairs if she re-fused . " " There was no reason she had to know that ! All she had to know was that I 'd found a fine husband for her  --  good family , good character , money of his own . It was a good , solid match  --  no father could have arranged a better ! How I arranged it was a matter of business that did n't concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Julian , " I should have been ashamed to tell her , too . " " By God , sir , you go too far ! " He raised a fist . Julian tensed himself to parry the blow . But Sir Robert got between them . " Mr. Craddock , you force me to remind you , it 's within my power to arrest you for an assault committed in my presence . As for you , Mr. Kestrel , be so good as to remember I sent for Mr. Craddock , not so that you could quarrel with him , but to allow you to question him about a possible link between the murder and my brother 's letters . " Craddock threw Julian a hard , wary look . " What do you want to know ? " Under questioning , he recounted how he had come upon the letters by chance , while making a visit of inspection to one of the pawnshops he owned . " It was in March , about three months ago . The jewelry box caught my eye . I thought Maud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runs that shop for me  --  said he had put it out for sale about a month before , because he 'd had it a year , and the owner had n't redeemed it or paid the interest . " Craddock had inspected the box and discovered the secret compartment containing the letters . " I read them , and a nice mixture of whining love letters and military information they were . It fairly made me sick . My first thought was to turn them over to the  | government and the newspapers . But it just so happened I 'd recently read in the society papers about a celebration in the offing for Hugh Fontclair 's coming of age . I got to thinking . I saw there was a better use for the letters . You know the rest . " " Did n't you want to know who 'd pawned the jewelry box ? " asked J ulian . " Of course . I asked Vorpe , but he could n't say . " " Does n't he have to keep a record of the name and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He could n't find the record of this transaction . The man 's as dull-witted as they come . I keep him in my employ because he 's meek and does as he 's told , and I do n't think he cheats me  --  or no more than most of my underlings do . " Julian was skeptical . " If he 'd lost the record , how did he know a year had gone by since the jewelry box was pawned , and it was time to put it out for sale ? " " He attaches a duplicate ticket to each item that 's left in pawn , showing what was paid for it , and when it 's due to be redeemed . I told him he keeps too many different bits of paper about him . This is n't the first time he 's lost a record . I said if it happens again , he 'll get the bag . " " Did he remember anything about the person who pawned the box ? " " No . I told you , the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him , he has customers in and out all day , every day . He . ould n't be expected to remember one who came in more than a year before . " " Does he know about the letters ? " " Not so far as I know . I did n't tell him . " " Have you any idea at all who pawned the box ? " " No . But whoever it was must not have known the letters were there , or did n't think they were worth keeping . " " Yes , " mused Julian , " that 's what Lady Tarleton said , too . " " I 'd still like to know why she told you about the letters . " Julian said , because he was curious to see how Craddock would react , " I think she wanted to stop me asking questions about what happened between you and her twenty years ago . "  | " You poke your nose into everything , do n't you ? What happened between me and Lady Tarleton is none of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rake up that matter again , " said Sir Robert . " It was thoroughly enquired into at the time ? " Craddock laughed shortly . " I gave you a fair hearing , " Sir Robert insisted , and you had nothing to say in your own defence . " " I would n't answer your sister 's accusations , because I knew there was no chance you 'd take my word against hers . " " Are you saying that my sister was lying ? " " Yes . She was lying . " " You never tried to force your attentions on her ? " " She was lying , " Craddock said stonily . " I wo n't deign to answer such an accusation . " " Of course not . I know I 'm not gentleman enough to quarrel with a Fontclair on equal terms . " " It ill becomes us to quarrel at all , now that we 're so soon to be linked by marriage . We owe one another at least an appearance of loyalty and respect . " " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I can manage that . " He turned to Julian . " What do you mean to do , now you know about Colonel Fontclair 's treason ? " " I mean to find out if it has any bearing on the murder . If it has n't , it 's no affair of mine . " " I suppose you 'll tell Maud about the letters ? " " Not unless I have to . I thought you might rather tell her yourself . " Craddock eyed him grimly . " All right . I 'll tell her . But do n't think she 'll come round me  --  make me change my mind . As long as I have the letters , I 'll hold the Fontclairs to their bargain . And it 'll be the worse for them if they do n't keep it ! " He went out . Sir Robert sighed . " We 'd better go to bed . We have the inquest in the morning . " " Just a moment . " Julian told him about his visit to Mrs. Warren , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would probably come out in her testimony at the inquest tomorrow , and he would as soon not be had on the carpet for keeping it back .  | He still said nothing about his finds at the old mill . On his way up to bed , he remembered Dick Felton , and his eagerness to help in the investigation . The boy was observant ; he might well have a talent for that kind of work . At any rate , Julian meant to find out . 1lc had just the job for an aspiring Bow Street Runner . * Sir Robert 's image appeared in Lady Fontclair 's dressing-table mirror . She turned and smiled at him . He came forward from the doorway and sat beside her , in the chair that was always kept there for him . Her maid edged discreetly out of the room . He had come to tell her about Kestrel 's discovery of Geoffrey 's secret , and about the latest finds in the investigation . He had also come to watch her take down her hair , which always gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she took out the pins one by one , and the dark silky mass spilled slowly down her neck and over her shoulders . The candlelight turned her few white hairs into lightning gleams of silver . She listened attentively , asking a question from time to time . When he finished , she sat silent for a while . Then she said , " Mr. Kestrel seems convinced that Geoffrey 's secret and the murder are linked . " " He suspects they are . " " Does he think Geoffrey murdered that girl ? " " I 'm sure he entertains the possibility . " " But , Robert , you and I know that ca n't be true ! " " My love , I 'm not sure I do know that . Not long since , I would have said Geoffrey was incapable of passing secrets to the enemy in wartime . I do n't trust him anymore . " " You ca n't think he would kill a young girl in cold blood ! " " I do n't think so , no . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said  --  that it is impossible . " " My dear love , you look as if you had the weight of the world on your shoulders . " She came round behind him and cradled his head against her breast . He closed his eyes . " You know , you must n't take Mr. Kestrel 's suspicions so much to heart . He 's worried about his servant being in gaol , and that makes him overzealous in trying  | to solve the murder . I ca n't blame him . That lockup is a dreadful place . Robert  --  you know I always hesitate to interfere in magisterial business ? " He looked around at her . " What is it , my dear ? " " There seems to be so little proof against Mr. Kestrel 's servant . Must you keep him in gaol any longer ? " How like her , he thought . In the midst of so many troubles nearer home , she could still spare concern for a servant and a stranger . " Tomorrow I shall either have to release him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold him for more than three days without binding him over for trial . " " What are you going to do ? " " I have n't decided . I still have n't heard from John Reeves , the special constable I sent to trace the girl 's journey . If she came from London , she and Stokes could have been acquainted . " " There are a great many people in London . It does n't seem much of a connexion . " " No . I admit there is n't much proof against him . The difficulty is , there 's no proof whatsoever against anyone else . " " Mr. Kestrel vouched for him , and Mr. Kestrel seems the sort of person who would be careful whom he kept as a servant . And , Robert , for what it 's worth , I saw something of Stokes before the murder  --  you know I make a point of observing people who come to stay in our house , even servants  --  and I thought he seemed a very nice young man . I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really think he 's innocent ? " " I really do , with all my heart . " Her wide , earnest eyes looked into his . " Well , if nothing further comes out against him at the inquest , I 'll order his release . " " Oh , I 'm so glad ! " She put her arms around him . He gathered her against him , kissed her lips , her cheeks , her throat . After more than twenty years of marriage , it still awed him that she belonged to him  --  that anything so fair and bright and sweet could be all his . He thought of Geoffrey 's attachment to Gabrielle Deschamps , and shuddered . Imagine being  | in thrall to a ruthless , manipulative woman  --  a woman you could not trust ! She drew back from him at last , flushed and smiling , and slipped into her seat at the dressing-table , taking up her comb again . " At least poor Mr. Kestrel need n't be burdened any longer with the investigation . He was only ever involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think he 's become interested in it for its own sake . " " He 's a very clever young man , and clever young men must have their amusements . But I 'm sure we can find something safer and pleasanter for him than solving a murder . " Next morning , Maud caught Julian alone before breakfast . " I want to thank you for making Papa tell me about Colonel Fontclair 's letters . " He shrugged . " I think he told you because he realized you had a right to know . " " I think someone made him realize it , " said Maud . He had no answer to this . " Will the secret have to come out ? " she asked . " That depends on whether it 's linked to the murder . " " Do you think it is ? " " Very likely . " At least if the secret comes out , Papa will lose his hold over the Fontclairs . It 's terrible , what he 's doing ! It 's mortifying to both the Fontclairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stop it . I wish Lady Tarleton had found the letters when she searched his room ! But he says they were n't there . He says he did n't bring them to Belle-garde . " " Did he say where they are ? " No . I asked , but he would n't tell me . I think they must be in the cabinet in his study at home . It 's a steel cabinet he had made specially to hold important papers . The padlock was designed by the best locksmith in London . Papa wears the key on a chain around his neck , with other important keys , and he never takes it off , even  | at night . So you see , if the letters are in that cabinet , there 's no way of getting at them . But there must be something else I can do to stop him threatening the Fontclairs . There must be ! " The inquest lasted all morning and a good part of the afternoon . It took place at the Blue Lion , in a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The place was packed with people from Alderton and beyond . Julian noticed three young men , thin as whippets , their scruffy clothes flecked with city soot , their fingers stained with ink . They were alternately darting sharp glances around them and scribbling in little notebooks . Clearly , the murder had gotten the attention of the London papers . Julian testified first , describing how he had found the girl 's body in his bed . Although this story was well known by now , his public retelling of it caused quite a stir . MacGregor then gave evidence about the manner and probable time of death . Dick Felton and Mrs. Warren were both difficult witnesses . Felton was enjoying himself and dragged out his evidence as long as he could , while Mrs. Warren was so struck with fear she could hardly speak at all . Senderby testified about what had been done to investigate the crime . There was a murmur of uneasiness among the listeners , as it became clear that there was no evidence of robbery or illegal entry at Bellegarde . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mundane explanations for the murder . A shadow of suspicion inevitably fell on the Fontclairs . Yet , as MacGregor had predicted , the coroner did not call them as witnesses or enquire into their whereabouts at the time of the murder . He spoke of them with great deference , and expressed his profound regret that they had been dragged into this sordid business . What he clearly hoped to establish was that Mr. Kestrel 's servant was the likely culprit . But there was simply no evidence linking Mr. Stokes to the crime or the victim . The jury had no choice but to bring in a verdict of willful murder by a person or persons unknown . After the inquest , Julian lost himself in the crowd , determined to avoid the three avid Londoners with the notebooks . He kept an  | eye out for Dick Felton and , finding him , asked to have a word with hum alone . Felton brought him to a small deserted yard next door , behind the greengrocer 's . " Have you got any work for me , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean ? " " I have a little job that needs doing , yes . " " Fm your man , sir ! I 'm game for anything . " " Do you know Bliss the pedlar ? " " ' Course I do ! Is he the one as done it , sir  --  the murder ? " " I doubt it . But I want to find him . Senderby is making efforts in that direction , but he does n't attach the importance to Bliss that I do . You said you could take some time away from your work at the Blue Lion . Will you have a try at finding Bliss for me ? " " Wo n't I just ! I 'll ask in all the villages if anyone 's seen him . I 'll track him like a red Indian . " His face fell . " Only I could n't stay away more nor a few days . My brother , who 'd be taking my place at the Lion , is starting work on a farm at the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see what happens . You may find Bliss by then , or at least get an idea where he 's gone . " " What should I do if I find him ? " " Try if you can to persuade him to come back and answer some questions . Tell him I 'll make it worth his while  --  I hear nothing charms him like the jingling of coins . " " He 'll do anything for money , sir , no mistake . " Julian made a wry face , remembering how he had once hoped a sojourn in the country would be a relief to his pocketbook . " If you find him , or any trace of him , I 'll make it worth your while as well . And I 'll pay your expenses , whether you find him or not . Is that a fair bargain ? " " Yes , sir ! " " One more thing . Can you arrange to have your brother take your place without telling him or anyone else what you 're doing for me ? " " Never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . This is strick'ly on the quiet , then , is it ? " " Exactly . "  | " Then mum 's the word , sir . I wo n't split on you . ' Split on ' is thieves ' talk for  --  but you probably know that , do n't you , sir ? " Dick said slyly . Julian began to get an inkling of the boy 's suspicions . He smiled , wondering what St. James Street would say about Julian Kestrel 's being mistaken for a barbarous Bow Street Runner . To the Quality , the Runners were a plague and a nuisance  --  forever raiding gaming hells , breaking up duels , interfering with all a gentleman 's amusements . But if the sons of peers knew how exciting it was to solve a crime , thought Julian , they would be joining Bow Street for a lark , the way they now paid to spar with professional boxers or handle the ribbons of a stagecoach . * Late in the day John Reeves , the special constable , returned from tracing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir Robert at Bellegarde . Julian did not hear about his visit till afterward , and was immediately suspicious . Why had he not been sent for to hear the man 's findings for himself ? He sought out Sir Robert in his office . " Mr. Kestrel , " Sir Robert greeted him . " I was just going to look for you . You 'll be glad to know I 've given Senderby orders to release your servant . I do n't believe there are sufficient grounds to charge him with the murder . " " I 'm very glad to hear it . Thank you . " " You ought to thank Lady Fontclair . She was very concerned about Mr. Stokes , and spoke warmly on his behalf , and yours . " " That was very good of her , " said Julian slowly . Of course he was pleased about Dipper 's release , but something about the manner of it gave him a prickly sensation at the back of his neck . " I must ask that you and your servant remain in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give evidence or answer further questions . But there should n't be any difficulty about that : you are still our guest , and I hope you 'll finish out your stay , in spite of this unfortunate incident . " Sir Robert sat down at his desk , as though he regarded their  | interview as at an end . But Julian asked , " I heard Reeves was here . What did he find out ? " Were you meaning to remain involved in the investigation , Mr. Kestrel ? Your servant is now at liberty . Surely your principal motive lior concerning yourself with the murder has been removed . " Yes , thought Julian , you 've very neatly removed it  --  at the in- ? t igation of Lady Fontclair . " Dipper may be out of gaol , but he 'll remain under suspicion as long as the real murderer is unknown . For that matter , the public is more than a little dubious about my role in this business . If the crime is n't solved , both Dipper and I may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives . " " Do you suppose I shall let the matter rest till the murderer is brought to justice ? " " I think you 'll do all that can be expected of a man , when his every move threatens the people he most loves . " " I know you believe I ca n't be impartial . To be frank , I had the same fear myself . That is why I agreed to let you take part in the investigation  --  to act as a gadfly , spurring me on to face possibilities I would rather have blinked away . I do n't need you to play that role anymore . Control of the investigation wo n't remain in my hands much longer . " " I do n't understand . " " Reeves tells me the girl set out for Alderton from a posting house in London . She had no companion and no servant ; she made all her travel arrangements herself . Beyond that , he found out nothing to the purpose . Few people saw or spoke with her . If she gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no choice but to circulate advertisements in London , on the chance that she lived or was known there , and offer a reward for information about her . " " If an investigation is carried out publicly in London , Bow Street is bound to become involved . " " Yes . You can imagine how little I welcome that prospect . Professional policemen are certain to root out the business of Geoffrey 's letters and Craddock 's use of them  --  and , unlike you , they wo n't have any qualms about making public whatever they find out . But the matter is out of my hands . Enquiries must be made in Lon-  | don  --  the girl 's identity is crucial to solving this crime . It seems there 's no avoiding Bow Street now . " Julian was no more pleased than Sir Robert . If Bow Street joined the investigation , the odds were that Dipper would be recognized , and his criminal past exposed . That might provide Sir Robert with just the foundation he needed to charge Dipper with the murder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all too short .  | Dipper was distressed at the way his master 's clothes had been cared for in his absence . " I would n't have used a goffering iron on this , " he said , shaking his head over one of Julian 's shirts . " Look how it 's queered the collar . " Julian was not attending . Dipper watched him take several turns about the room , then asked , " Anything on your mind , sir ? " " Sir Robert told me the investigation is moving to London . That means the Bow Street Runners will almost certainly become in-volved . " " I thought they would in the end , sir , " nodded Dipper . " If they blow upon me , I 'll say you did n't know nothing about me when you took me on . I 'll say I gammoned you into thinking I was on the square . " " That should do wonders for my reputation for judgement , " said Julian lightly . " You got to let me bonnet for you , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " The dressing bell rang . Julian , ducking Dipper 's protests , began to change for dinner . " You know , " he said , frowning , " your name will probably crop up in the newspaper accounts of the inquest . If the London police read them , they may blow upon you , as you call it , even before they 're drawn into the investigation . "  | " That depends , sir . They know me as Dipper , on account of that 's what I was called when I was a fingersmith . They might not know the name Stokes . " " Then it 's a mercy you were always referred to as ' Stokes ' at the inquest . " He made a rueful face . " I ought not to have gone on calling you by your old nickname . It just seemed to suit you so well . " " I always liked it better nor Stokes , sir . A name ought to say something about a cove , that 's what I say . " " According @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small and rather noisy bird of prey . Well , I could be worse off . Imagine going through life with a name like Silas Vorpe . " Dipper blinked at him . " How do you know about Mr. Vorpe , sir ? " " Do you know about him ? " " He 's the Maggot , sir . " " I beg your pardon ? " " That 's what we called him , me pals and me . If you was to see him , sir , you 'd understand . He 's very big and white and soft , and bald as a billiard ball . " " How do you know him ? " " Well , betwixt you and me , sir , he 's an angling cove . What would you call it ? A receiver . " " Of stolen goods ? " " Yes , sir . Though the pawnshop he runs is mostly on the square . Otherwise the cove as owns it would be down upon him and turn him out , and he needs the shop so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crib he runs on the sly , but sometimes we used to bring him moveables at the pawnshop  --  small things like tickers and wipes , that we 'd just nicked and had to get rid of in a hurry . He fenced ' em for us , no questions asked . Never give us anything like what they was worth , but what could we do ? If we was caught with the swag , we 'd go straight to boarding school . " " Did you know it was Craddock who owns that pawnshop ? " " No , sir , " said Dipper , much surprised . " He thinks Vorpe is extremely dull-witted , but honest " " Well , he 's wrong twice over , sir . Mr. Vorpe 's neither of those . Flash to every move , is Mr. Vorpe . And his memory 's something  | wonderful  --  all he has to do is set his oglers once on a ticker or a glimstick , or whatever kind of moveable you like , and he can call it to mind years later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Dipper , I think it 's time I told you what I discovered while you were in  --  boarding school . But keep this strictly between the two of us . " He explained how Craddock had found Geoffrey 's letters and used them to blackmail the Fontclairs . " What puzzles me , " he finished , " is that Mr. Vorpe , who according to you has amazing powers of recollection , could remember nothing at all about the person who pawned the jewelry box . " " He probably thought it was pinched , sir , and he did n't want to peach on the thief . We 're his livelihood , ai n't we , sir ? He 'd have nothing to fence , if he was to get a name for splitting on his pals . " " Do you realize you always say ' we ' when you talk about thieves ? You still think of yourself as one of them , do n't you ? " " It dies pretty hard , sir . I mean , when you 're in the Family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and everybody that 's in it is your friend , and everybody else is against you . But I do n't miss it , sir , and I would n't go back to it now . God strike me blind if I would ! " " I believe you . " " Anyways , I expect Mr. Craddock could have got Mr. Vorpe to blow the gab , if he 'd pressed hard enough . But Mr. Vorpe fakes people into thinking he 's soft , sir . " Dipper tapped his head significantly . " Most likely Mr. Craddock thought he really did n't know nix-my-doll about the jewelry box . " " Dipper , " said Julian thoughtfully , " does Vorpe know you gave over thieving ? " " I do n't see how he could , sir . ' Course , he has n't seen me for nigh to two years , but he probably thinks I 'm in quod or marinated ? sent over the water , I mean . " " And does he know you as Thomas Stokes , or only as Dipper ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " So that even if he reads about the murder in the newspapers , he wo n't connect you with it . " " Most likely not . You got something in mind , sir ? " " Yes , " said Julian , his eyes gleaming . " As a matter of fact , I do . "  | In the drawing room before dinner , Miss Craddock asked Julian for news of the investigation . " I have n't told Sir Robert yet , " he said , " but I mean to go to London tomorrow and beat some bushes there . " " How funny . I 'm going to London tomorrow , too . " She began to blush , and hurried on , " I have ever so much shopping to do for the wedding , and I need to get away from Bellegarde for a few days , after everything that 's happened . I 've been wanting to give Miss Pritchard a little holiday , and Lady Fontclair said I might take her with me for propriety 's sake , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think he wants to stay here and keep an eye on the Fontclairs , and the investigation . " She ended with a little gasp for breath . Julian felt sure she had given him every possible reason for her trip except the true one . " You must let me take you in our carriage , " she added . " It 's a new barouche-landau , and very comfortable . If the weather is fine , we can let down the top . " " That would be delightful . Thank you . " He thought privately that he would have travelled much more quickly alone . With two ladies , the journey would take up most of the day , what with keeping the horses to a moderate pace , and getting out at every posting house for fortifying cups of tea . All the same , he thought he had better go with her . He suspected she was playing some kind of deep game , and might need his help . Sir Robert came in , and Julian excused himself , saying he wanted to speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert aside ; then they left the drawing room together . Hugh had been watching Miss Craddock and Kestrel . He could not keep from watching them when they had their heads together like that . He was driven partly by jealousy , and partly by a wish to understand Miss Craddock , who was an ever more tantalizing mystery . That afternoon he had invited her riding , just the two of them ,  | but the outing left him more puzzled and unsatisfied than ever . He never seemed to get close to her . They talked a good deal , but always she kept gently , maddeningly aloof . She charmed him in a thousand little ways , but without trying  --  without even noticing . He yearned w read her heart and found it locked against him . And he tormented himself with wondering if Julian Kestrel had the key . She was walking back and forth before a window now , her hands clasped under her chin . Hugh summoned his courage and went up to her . " I enjoyed our ride today . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him feel a little breathless . But almost at once she dragged down her gaze . " So did I. " " Am I intruding ? Would you rather I kept away ? I know it was n't your choice to be engaged to me . I do n't want to burden you with a bridegroom 's attentions , if you 'd rather be left alone . If I only knew your mind , I 'd study to please you  --  but I do n't , so I just go blundering about . " " Oh , no ! You 're very kind to me ! It 's like heaping coals of fire on my head , after the way my father 's behaved toward your family . I would n't blame you if you hated me . " " I would never be so unjust ! I know you 're not responsible for what your father is doing . You would never countenance anything low or deceitful or dishonourable . " The colour flamed up in her face . " Why do you look away ? Please do n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blames you for any of this . It 's so beastly unfair that we 've had to be caught up in this tangle ! If we 'd been allowed to get to know each other in the ordinary way ? " She looked around at him , with bright eyes and parted lips . He caught her hand in both of his . " Miss Craddock  --  Maudmy mother told me you were leaving tomorrow to spend a day or two in London . Why should n't I come with you ? We could really get to know each other , far from your father , and my family . If Miss Pritchard comes with us , and I stay at our house in town , no one could possibly think it improper . " " Oh , but I  --  I would n't want to take you away from your  | family  --  what with the murder and  --  and everything . It 's such a short trip , we 're going to shop the whole time , I 'm sure you would be bored ? " " I understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Pardon me for putting you in such an awkward spot . Since you find my company so distasteful , I wo n't thrust it upon you again . " He bowed and turned away  --  but slowly , hoping against hope she would call him back . But her throat felt so tight she could not get out a word . Besides , what could she say ? He would never believe it was for his own good that she dared not go with him to London . Julian told Sir Robert he was going to London to pursue a lead from a confidential informant . " I ca n't tell you who he is , but if you 'll let me hunt about for a few days , I think I may uncover something very important . And at least I can make my enquiries discreetly , without involving the professional police . " " Mr. Kestrel , why ca n't you leave this matter alone , and let justice take its course ? " " You mean , let justice stumble along when I can speed it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir Robert went away to the window , looking out with unseeing eyes . " I 'm not so deaf to all sense of duty as to stand in the way of any course of action that might help solve the murder . Yes , by all means , Mr. Kestrel , you may go . " At dinner , there was desultory talk about Maud 's shopping trip . Julian mentioned he had business in London and would be travelling with her . Hugh started , and looked from Maud to Julian as if to say , " I might have known ! " The others threw Julian uneasy glances , but if they guessed his journey had something to do with the investigation , they did not say so . The Fontclairs rarely spoke of the murder in his presence anymore . It was one of the ways they had quietly closed ranks against him . Sir Robert and Lady Fontclair were called away after dinner to sit up with Philippa , who had had trouble sleeping since the murder .  | For the others , the evening in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner and wrote letters . Geoffrey fidgeted . Catherine paced . Guy tramped about the garden , smoking . Isabelle sat quietly embroidering Maud 's wedding slippers . Hugh attached himself to her and talked with forced animation about art , the estate  --  any topic that might make Maud feel excluded . Maud shrank into a window recess with her workbox and a large handkerchief . Julian managed to entice her out to play backgammon with him . At last it was time to go up to bed . A footman handed candles to people as they left the drawing room . Craddock , on his way out with Maud , took Julian aside . " Just remember : If Maud marries against my wishes , I 'll cut her off with a shilling . So if you 're planning a hole-in-corner wedding in Scotland once you get her away with you , think again . " " Please , Papa ! " Maud entreated , taking him by the arm . For her sake , Julian swallowed his irritation , bowed , and withdrew . To avoid another confrontation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went up himself . He climbed the grand staircase , the light from his candle darting along the wall . The house , though very quiet , seemed strangely alert and aware . He could almost feel it breathing , like a living thing . From the top of the stairs , the shortest way to his room was through e great chamber . He went in . The room looked fantastic by candlelight . The gilding on the oodwork gleamed ; the birds and flowers on the plaster ceiling med alive . Moonlight silvered the Gothic windows and threw pale shadows on the marble floor . Julian could see why Philippa thought this room should have a ghost And it did . A woman 's shape stood , motionless , on the other side the room . She was small and slender , like the dead girl . Julian started violently , then got a grip on himself . " Who 's there ? " " Hush ! " She came forward , her skirt swishing softly along the floor . He held his candle toward her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Mr. Kestrel . Please do n't go to London tomorrow . " " I 'm afraid I must . I 'm sorry . "  | " You do n't understand the harm you may do . You may find something out that , standing alone , seems to prove one of us a murderer . But you do n't know us , Mr. Kestrel . How can you tell what we 've done , or might do ? None of us  --  none of my family ? would kill anyone . I know them . I know them all . " " I understand how you must feel . I had the same faith in my servant when he was accused . Of course a servant is n't the same as a blood relation  --  except that I have n't any family but Dipper , so it was the same in my case . " " But he 's free now . Is n't that enough ? Why must you keep on with your investigations ? " " Is that why you brought about his release  --  so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the murder ? " " I hoped that in common kindness you might leave us in peace , once he was no longer in danger . Ca n't you let Robert handle everything now ? He 's a magistrate . He knows what to do . " " I have information that only I can make use of . That 's why I 'm going to London  --  why I must go . " " Is there no way I can move you ? " She came close , laying her hands on his shoulders with a light , tender , almost seductive touch . He felt a little bewitched . The moonlight , this enchanted room , her beautiful , pale face so near , the breath of perfume clinging round her He took her hands from his shoulders . " I wish with all my heart I could do as you ask , " he said gently , " but it is n't possible . If you 'd rather I did n't stay at Bellegarde any longer , I 'll understand . Sir Robert asked me to remain in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accommodation at the Blue Lion . " " No . " She drew back , shaking her head . " My son invited you . You 're the man he chose to be groomsman at his wedding , and the man my husband trusts to pursue the investigation on his behalf . It is n't for me to deny you admittance to Bellegarde . Besides , what good would it do ? If you find out something in London that might harm  --  anyone here  --  keeping you out wo n't prevent the damage . The wheels of what 's called justice will turn all the same . " *  | Maud brought her father a cup of chamomile tea before he went to bed . " Mrs. Cox let me make it myself , " she said . He took it , but looked at her shrewdly . " You do n't fool me , my girl . " " Do n't I ? " she said faintly . " You 're trying to put me in a good humour so I wo n't guess you 're up to some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth : Ih you mean to run off with Kestrel ? " " No , Papa . There 's nothing like that between Mr. Kestrel and mr . I did n't even know he was going to London when I decided to III . But since he 's leaving on the same day , it would have been churlish of me not to offer him a seat in my carriage . " " That man means no good by you , Maud . He 's after your money . " " Please do n't worry . I do n't believe Mr. Kestrel wants to marry r , and even if he did , I would n't accept him . Truly , I promise . " Craddock suddenly drew her to him and kissed her on the brow . ' You 're a good girl , Maud , " he muttered . Then he turned away rusquely , and so did not see the grieved , guilty look on her face .  | " No . " He shifted in his chair , and looked miserably at Sir Robert . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kestrel and I will continue to search for a link between the murder and this matter of your letters . You must understand that , if there is such a link , I ca n't shield you any longer . The whole story will have to come out . " " What if there is n't a link ? " Geoffrey 's hollow eyes shifted from Sir Robert to Julian . " I assure you , Colonel , I have no interest in revealing anything I 've learned about your family that is n't related to the murder . " Geoffrey rose heavily . " If you 're finished with me , I 'll go now . " " I have a few more questions , " said Julian . " On Thursday evening , Lady Tarleton and I found you in the gun room with Lady Fontclair . She was saying to you , It 's wicked and wrong . Promise you will never think of it again . ' What did she mean ? " Geoffrey 's ruddy colour deepened . " I was thinking I might just load @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cecily made me promise not to . She said I 'd show more courage by facing up to things . And she said my death would n't stop Craddock from using my letters against the family . " He paused , then asked hoarsely , " Anything else ? " " I was wondering if you 're in the habit of carrying a knife . " " I have a pocket knife , " stammered Geoffrey , eyes dilating . " Did you have it with you on the day of the murder ? " " I ? I do n't remember . " Sir Robert moved away , as though he really could not bear to look at Geoffrey any longer . " If you 're satisfied , Mr. Kestrel , I think we can allow my brother to go . " Geoffrey started toward the door , then turned and said piteously , " Have you got to tell Guy about my letters , and everything ? " " We 've been keeping it from Guy , " Sir Robert explained to Julian . " Geoffrey did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be gained by burdening him with the knowledge . " " Does Hugh know ? " " We had to tell him . It would n't have been right to ask him to accede to Craddock 's demands without telling him what was at stake . "  | " And Miss Fontclair ? " " She has n't been told . She takes such pride in our name and lineage that I wanted to spare her knowledge of this dishonour . " Geoffrey turned his face away , and hobbled slowly out of the room . Sir Robert looked after him stonily , then rang for the footman and told him he wished to speak with Mr. Craddock
