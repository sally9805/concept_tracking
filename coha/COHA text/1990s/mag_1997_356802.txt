Here 's a bipartisan program that is saving taxpayers millions every year : nearly 250 of the government 's 726 most senior jobs are going unfilled , an unusually slow pace even by Clinton standards . Posts prestigious and powerful are going begging : Surgeon General , ambassador to Russia , head of the Food and Drug Administration , five of the top six slots at Justice and the Deputy Secretary of Commerce . Several factors are at work : <P> WHITE HOUSE INDECISION <P> In the beginning , there was EGG  --  for Ethnicity , Geography and Gender , the three factors used by Clinton to select nominees . Those characteristics still count , but sheer desperation to avoid any hint of S  --  for Scandal  --  has nearly choked the process to a halt . Burned by an outspoken Joycelyn Elders and a bumbling Henry Foster , Clinton has yet to name a Surgeon General . The Administration is dawdling even on routine appointments such as the promotion of David Lipton from Treasury Assistant Secretary to Undersecretary . <P> THE DRIVEN-SNOW PROBLEM <P> Since 1978 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details of everything from teenage drug use to housekeeper taxes , and then submit to separate White House , FBI and Senate investigations , all of which can take several months . Some nominees pre-empt questions themselves : last week CIA director-designate George Tenet asked the Senate to delay his confirmation vote in order to look into investments his father gave him without his knowledge in 1983 . <P> OBSTRUCTION <P> In a bitterly partisan Washington , Senate Republicans can make a name by morphing into one-man roadblocks . Alabama 's Richard Shelby clocked 15 minutes of fame by stopping CIA nominee Anthony Lake , who eventually withdrew . Orrin Hatch , head of the judiciary committee , last week abruptly postponed hearings for Eric Holder to be Deputy Attorney General because Holder 's office once asked the IRS to delay a probe of D.C. police officers . Fifty-seven other presidential nominations are awaiting congressional approval . <P> WHO NEEDS THIS ? <P> The hypothetical voice of a prospective nominee : " I make six figures and have an expense account that reaches from here to eternity . Tell me again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toil away in a huge government bureaucracy . " Statements like that help explain why a nominee like businessman and Democratic fund raiser Terry McAuliffe withdrew his name from consideration for Secretary of Commerce . Even hush-hush high finance is n't a draw : two governorships on the Federal Reserve are vacant . Any takers ? <P>  --  By Sally B. Donnelly/Washington
