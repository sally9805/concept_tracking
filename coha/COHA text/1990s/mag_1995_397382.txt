Jerry Dodson , 51 , dean of socially responsible investing ( defined at left ) , is not your typical tree-hugging stock picker . In November , for example , the manager of the $150 million Parnassus Fund in San Francisco ( 3.5% load , 800-999-3505 ) voted for California Gov . Pete Wilson because the incumbent Republican took a stronger pro-business stance than Democratic challenger Kathleen Brown . Moreover , Dodson , unlike most of his fund 's peers , particularly the 13 politically correct ones , has trounced the market over the past three years . For that period , his fund returned 94% , triple the 32% earned by the S &P; 500 index and the 30% average for socially responsible stock funds overall . What about disappointing 1994 ? At last count , Parnassus was up 8% , vs. no change for the S &P; 500 and the do-gooders ' 3% decline . Why are n't the other altruistic funds so enriching ? They tend to buy inherently pricey growth stocks " that happen to be good corporate citizens , " says Dodson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now heads its team of four analysts . " We 're strict value investors who wait until these companies encounter a sudden  --  but temporary  --  setback that effectively wrings much of the risk out of the stock . " At MONEY 's request , Dodson recommends five such fallen angels drawn from Parnassus ' 30 holdings . As a group , the five are priced 24% below their ' 94 highs and sell for a rock-bottom 1.3 times book value , or net worth per share ( vs. three times book value for companies in the S &P; 500 ) . They also have the potential to rebound 35% to 68% in ' 95 , and two pay dividends as well ( see the table below ) . ( Table omitted ) His five favorites : Groundwater Technology ( ticker symbol : GWTI ; lately $13.75 ) . Shares of Groundwater , a $182 million ( annual sales ) specialist in cleaning up leaks from underground fuel tanks , have dropped roughly 50% since 1992 in step with a 40% decline in such remediation spending by major oil companies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station tanks is huge , at about $1.5 billion , " says Dodson . " But the Clinton Administration has n't vigorously enforced existing regulations . " ( Bureaucratic turf battles appear to be part of the problem . " The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency goes in only if a state does nothing , " says EPA spokesman Gwen Brown . ) What many investors have also ignored is that the Norwood , Mass. firm has slashed both its operating costs and dependence on Big Oil  --  source of just 37% of ' 94 revenues , vs. 64% in ' 90 . New business includes some $200 million in cleanup contracts for the Defense Department and other government clients in the past two years . As a result , Dodson expects earnings to spurt 38% in ' 94 and 53% in ' 95 , lifting the stock 45% to $20 by the end of the year . Huffy Corp . ( HUF ; $14.25 ) . Did Santa bring your family a new bike for Christmas ? If so , Dodson is betting it 's from $713 million Huffy , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation 's $3.2 billion market . So why has the stock backpedaled 29% from its ' 94 high of nearly $20 ? The Miamisburg , Ohio firm , he says , was caught in a price war with Asian rivals that were dumping bikes in the U.S. normally sold in Europe , which has been in recession . " I 'm banking this year on a strong Euro-recovery absorbing much of this excess capacity , " explains Dodson , " while Huffy 's new $15 million plant helps shrink its unit costs another 15% or so . " He figures earnings , which will be flat in ' 94 , can accelerate 24% this year and carry the stock to $23 , a possible 68% profit . Advanced Technology Labs ( ATLI ; $17.75 ) . The stock of this leading $360 million maker of ultrasound imaging equipment has slumped 26% from its record $24 peak after Bill Clinton 's election two years ago . " Like many medical stocks , " says Dodson , " ATL has been depressed by the Hillary Syndrome "  --  the tendency for hospitals to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This year , however , he figures the Bothell , Wash . company can reverse losses in ' 93 ( $2 million ) and ' 94 ( a forecast $1.5 million ) with a fat $8 million profit that 's capable of compounding 20% annually through 1998 . Now that Republicans rule Congress , Dodson argues , health reform will become more market-driven and unleash pent-up demand from hospitals for ATL 's advanced digital machines ( cost : at least $150,000 ) . The selling point ? Their high-resolution images usually are more cost-effective than conventional X-rays or biopsies . His ' 95 target for the stock is $24 , a 35% gain . Sunrise Medical ( SMD ; $27.75 ) . Like ATL , says Dodson , this $508 million Carlsbad , Calif. concern profits big as health care becomes more cost-conscious . Indeed , the shift from gold-plated hospital care to more home-based rehab has fueled five-year earnings growth averaging 29% annually at Sunrise , the world 's No. 1 maker of home medical gear such as ultralight wheelchairs . The stock , however , has slid 17% from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snafu that stalled Medicare claims reimbursements to many of Sunrise 's dealers , discouraging them from rebuilding inventory . " While Medicare has corrected the problem , " says Dodson , " Wall Street apparently has n't noticed . " He sees profits surging 33% this year , elevating the stock 37% to $38 . TJ International ( TJCO ; $16.25 ) . Do n't be put off by the flat ' 94 earnings of this $614 million Boise firm , the leading maker of engineered lumber products like laminated beams and joists , or the stock 's 50% fall from last year 's high . Dodson is convinced that investors have been unduly spooked by a combination of rising interest rates , which undermines the entire housing sector , and a 12% drop in once hot lumber prices during the third quarter of ' 94 . " TJ has a dominant 60% share of a $615 million market that figures to grow 20% annually for the rest of the ' 90s , " he predicts . The impetus ? Builders are fast replacing conventional milled beams and joists with laminates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasingly regulated old-growth forests . Adds Dodson : " I see earnings rebounding 100% in ' 95 and the stock rising about 54% to $25 "  --  a profit you need n't be a tree hugger to appreciate . <p>
