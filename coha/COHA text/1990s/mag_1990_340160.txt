Should a university have the right to get rid of a " grossly incompetent " teacher ? Should a professor whose classroom performance does students a " disservice " be sent packing ? Outside the ivory tower , few people would say no . But when the University of California , Berkeley , last year became the first school to draft rules for firing tenured teachers , some charged that this amounted to an assault on their intellectual freedom . " You 'll never go broke overestimating how sensitive the tenure issue is to faculty , " says Richard Chait , director of the National Center for Post-Secondary Governance and Finance at the University of Maryland . " It 's like abortion or flag burning in another walk of life . " <P> Berkeley 's action is only one sign that the once sacrosanct institution is vulnerable these days . Last month , in a 9-to-0 decision , the U.S. Supreme Court declared that a university could not refuse to open its tenure files to ) federal investigators when challenged on the grounds of race or sex discrimination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole notion of tenure , which at some schools can mean permanent employment after as little as three years on the job . A 1987 survey by the Department of Education found that during the preceding three years , 93% of U.S. colleges and universities had taken some action that " may have had the effect of reducing the proportion of faculty members on tenure . " Arkansas legislators last year required all state campuses to review tenured teachers annually , partly to decide whether to retain them . Says Mike Gauldin , spokesman for Governor Bill Clinton : " This is how we 're going to make sure our money is well spent . " <P> What was once considered a lifetime job is no longer such a sure thing . Dismissals of faculty " for cause "  --  ranging from sexual harassment and misappropriation to sheer ineptitude  --  have risen from virtually zero in the ' 60s and ' 70s to about a dozen a year . For the first time in its 123-year history , for example , the University of Kansas is trying to fire a tenured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is accused of failing to carry out her " academic responsibilities " and of behaving abusively toward her colleagues and superiors . Says Willner , who denied all the charges in 120 hours of hearings last fall : " Even if the allegations were true , I do not believe they would be grounds for dismissal of a tenured professor who is an active and recognized scholar . " <P> Part of the reason for the current tenure debate is the 1986 federal law that eliminates mandatory retirement at age 70 . The prospect of elderly  --  and high-salaried  --  professors hanging on until they drop at the lectern has some cost-conscious administrators worried . " With the uncapping of retirement , tenure becomes a guarantee of lifetime work , " says James Vinson , president of the University of Evansville in Indiana . Many schools have begun to nudge older professors out the door with a variety of enticements . Johns Hopkins University decided three years ago to increase the basic pension payments of departing 65-year-olds by 20% to 30%  --  a bonus that shrinks the longer they stay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into retirement while younger colleagues , with whom they are paired as mentors , are phased into full-time teaching positions .
