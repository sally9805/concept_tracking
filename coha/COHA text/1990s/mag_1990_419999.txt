Section : NATIONAL AFFAIRS The cold war buildup fouled thousands of acres . Now the Pentagon faces a costly fight to clean up . <p> To the victors in the cold war go the spoils  --  and the spoilage . It 's in the form of fouled soil , contaminated drinking water and acres of wilderness pocked with unexploded bombs . The Pentagon 's arsenal , assembled over 40 years to keep the lid on superpower conflict , has left deep scars on the home front . While a generation of new laws and a growing environmental consciousness are bringing private industry to heel , the Department of Defense is America 's most pervasive and protected polluter . <p> Now , as budget cuts draw down the military , the United States must confront a daunting post-cold-war cleanup . The military 's 871 domestic installations , strung across 25 million acres of land , produce more tons of hazardous waste each year than the top five U.S. chemical companies combined . Department of Defense reports document 8,000 sites that may require some form of environmental restoration , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or more . The issue will gain momentum early next year when the first of 86 military bases , targeted for cost-cutting closures , begin to shut down . Contaminated ground water , unlined beds of toxic sludge and porous , carelessly constructed landfills make their conversion to civilian use problematic  --  and expensive . The cost of their restoration could easily eclipse the $5.6 billion in savings the closures were expected to yield over the next two decades . " Next to outright conflict itself , " says Rep. Richard Ray , of the House Armed Services Committee , " this is probably the No. 1 priority the Defense Department has to face . " <p> The Pentagon is legally bound to clean the bases before they are sold . But many will be shut for years before they are put right . The size of the task , a plodding bureaucracy and military reluctance to commit its dwindling largesse to mopping up , will add years to the conversion . Some communities fear a double economic hit : the loss of a military base and environmental barriers that could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not what people had in mind when they gave up the property for national security , " says New Hampshire Rep. Robert Smith . <p> The military 's toxic inventory is bounded neither by geography nor size ; it includes notorious big messes and nasty little surprises . The Rocky Mountain Arsenal , a 27-square-mile complex in metropolitan Denver , was a laboratory for some of the Army 's most deadly alchemy  --  the production of nerve gas . Once an economic boon and a source of local pride ( ARSENAL MEANS DEATH FOR FOES , AID TO DENVER , crowed a 1954 headline in the The Denver Post ) , the plant produced a soup of chemical byproducts left in vast holding ponds . Last year visitors to South Beach at Martha 's Vineyard found military teams cautiously sifting through sand dunes to collect 1,500 old ordnance shells . The Massachusetts retreat was once a World War II practice bombing target . Startled islanders who had hauled the stray rounds home as oddities dragged them back for inspection by military munitions experts . <p> Nowhere in this country is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Jefferson Proving Ground ( JPG ) in southern Indiana . Since 1941 workers have test-fired 23 million artillery , mortar and tank rounds across 90 square miles of forests and wildflower meadows . An estimated 1.4 million of those test rounds have n't exploded  --  yet . The result is a wasteland layered with deadly debris . Shells protrude menacingly from the ground , others have burrowed as far as 24 feet below . There are also armor-piercing rounds made of radioactive uranium and munitions containing white phosphorus , which ignites on contact with air . " Poke your nose in the Army 's business and you might disappear , " says Jane Hance , whose farmhouse windows rattle with the thunder of steady cannonades . " They do n't even know what they 've got over there . " <p> Now Jefferson is on the Pentagon 's closure list , but extracting this ordnance will be no day at the beach . Shutting down the range will save the Pentagon about $7 million a year . Cleanup estimates run into the billions . A study commissioned by Indiana officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the site for a wildlife preserve . Even if money were no object , DOD officials all but admit they could never extract all the ordnance . Townspeople fear a mothballed parcel that would be forever treacherous . <p> More than safety is at stake . Good jobs like the 410 civilian positions at Jefferson are hard to come by in nearby Madison , a picturesque Ohio River town . Mayor Morris Wooden peppers Congress with mailings that detail the absurd cost-benefit of the closing , stamping the word STUPID in red across the top of each . " Grade-school math tells you the Army wo n't want to remove this unexploded ordnance , " says Wooden . " But we are determined not to let them walk away from the ground they seized 49 years ago . " <p> Double standard : A curious double standard protects the Pentagon from vigorous environmental regulation . Ambiguities in federal law have prevented some state and local governments from levying civil fines against military facilities that violate hazardous-waste laws . Moreover , the Environmental Protection Agency does not file civil suits against other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) partment , which would bring any action on EPA 's behalf , says the Constitution precludes such suits . It insists that EPA rely on voluntary agreements that can take year I to negotiate . The result is that cities and states , which must comply with federal standards at their own sewage-treatment plants , have limited recourse when Uncle Sam pollutes . Two bills pending in Congress would strengthen EPA 's hand and allow states to penalize federal polluters . <p> The Pentagon is hardly alone among federal agencies in slovenly environmental practice . The Department of Energy , the other custodian of the cold-war arsenal , faces a 30-year program to clear radioactive waste from its 17 plants and laboratories . But while DOE 's problems may be more notorious , the military 's mess is more diffuse . Many of the hot sites are at large bases , but others are wedged in a sprawling infrastructure of obscure arsenals , depots and plants . Ninety-two Pentagon facilities are on , or proposed for addition to , EPA 's Superfund list " These places produce materials serials designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soil specialist with the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency . " It 's not surprising that their byproducts are often toxic . " <p> The Pentagon says that after a slow start , it is beginning to make peace with the environment . " We started from further down the hill , but I look at the progress we 've made over the last couple of years , " says David Berteau , the Defense Department 's top environmental official . But EPA and congressional regulators say DOD 's budget does n't reflect the rhetoric . The White House is proposing $817 million for environmental restoration in 1991 , up more than 30 percent from this year but still less than .3 percent of the total Defense budget ( Congress is expected to add more ) . " They talk about the environment . Cheney puts out memos , but the reality is , are they budgeting the money ? " asks one House committee staffer . <p> Years of red tape and bureaucratic jawboning often delay cleanups . For three years U.S. Rep. James Saxton has tried to get the Air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that were contaminated by plutonium in 1960 when a Bomarc missile warhead caught fire . The military is willing , the task relatively inexpensive , but nothing has happened . " I think we 've dealt with nine federal agencies to iron out details , " he laments . " We get report after report . But nobody does anything . " <p> The military 's penchant for secrecy and devotion to standardized procedure have slowed the growth of environmental consciousness . Some critics say the old cold war attitude has improved , but that the Pentagon is still way behind the learning curve . " DOD installations are what the oil and chemical industries were 15 years ago , " says Shira Flax , a toxics expert at the Sierra Club . <p> Too often military intransigence poses the greatest ecological threat . Riverside , Calif. , officials discovered toxic waste in wells near the perimeter of Norton Air Force Base a decade ago , the installation sits atop the Bunker Hill aquifer , primary source of drinking water for the desert city 50 miles east of Los Angeles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  an industrial solvent and suspected carcinogen  --  might pollute the municipal water supply , the city asked for quick action . The EPA added Norton to its Superfund list in 1987 , and city officials believed the problem would be resolved with dispatch . <p> They were wrong . Instead , EPA and Air Force officials spent two years haggling over how to investigate the extent of the pollution . " It was just appalling , " says Riverside at Attorney Roger Luebs , part of a citizens group monitoring the dispute . " EPA , would send them letters saying the test I you propose is unsatisfactory . The Air Force would sit on it and then send back another letter . Just back and forth . " Meanwhile , another problem cropped up : uranium in the well water . Some suspect a leak in the concrete tomb under the 11th tee of the base golf course , where workers buried radium once used to illuminate aircraft cockpit dials . <p> ' Pump and treat ' : Air Force officials say technical complexities and a sluggish EPA hindered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to install a $42 million " pump and treat " system by 1991 to intercept the plume and decontaminate the ground water  --  a process that could continue for more than a decade . Norton will close in 1994 , and the Air Force says it is committed to completing the task . But Riverside residents worry about what happens if the contamination proves more serious than first thought . " What they think gets the job done may be a lot less than what 's really needed , " says Luebs . <p> Riverside is actually lucky . Because of Norton 's Superfund status , it will get first shot at the Pentagon 's environmental money . Only a handful of bases earmarked for closure , however , will enjoy such priority . The Pentagon says there are more serious problems at scores of bases that will remain open . Under its " worst first " system , those facilities will get the lion 's share of the funding . But Congress , worried that slow cleanups will threaten economic redevelopment in their districts , wants the Pentagon to move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would add $82 million to helpbasesearmarked forshuttering . The measure is likely to be included in the House version of the 1991 Pentagon budget . <p> Even bases with Superfund designation will be shut long before they can be cleaned . First on the closure list is Pease Air Force Base near Portsmouth , N.H. , north of Boston . State officials hope it can be converted to light industry , a convention center and a coastline wildlife refuge . But it boasts some 20 waste sites , including toxic sludge dumps and a fire-training area that was repeatedly drenched with jet fuel and set ablaze . Pease will close next March ; while decontamination at the worst sites on the base is underway , it will be 1994 before the Air Force even has all the problems diagnosed . Some 500 of Pease 's 4,254 acres will probably be cordoned off for years  --  a prospect creating congressional headaches for the EPA . " Redeveloping Pease is the New Hampshire delegation 's big project , " says one agency official . " We 're satisfying them  --  for now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic concerns may grow more tense , partly because the term cleanup is a misnomer . While the worst sites might eventually be suitable for limited surface uses , they will never be completely safe . Even the military 's success stories can leave frightening legacies . <p> Near homes at the fringe of the Twin Cities Army Ammunition Plant ( TCAAP ) north of Minneapolis-St . Paul , brightly colored well caps sprout from the ground , marking the water-monitoring stations . For decades plant workers hauled toxics to sites bluntly marked DUMP on Army maps . The liquids sank through 150 feet of sandy soil to the metropolitan area 's main system of ground-water aquifers . In 1981 the state confronted the Army with evidence of poisoned municipal wells . The Army reluctantly began a cleanup of the soil and ground water that will take 30 years , maybe longer . <p> Neighbors have adjusted . Public meetings that once drew large , angry throngs to discuss the plant 's history of pollution now draw only handfuls of environmental gadflies . And state officials say they are satisfied with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plant are still being identified . " The harder we look , the more we find , " says Mark Schmitt , who oversees the project for the state . Yet with each small improvement at the facility , a surrounding suburb wants to appropriate a piece of the land for its own use . Some neighbors envision a sports complex of baseball diamonds and soccer fields . But the prospect of kids kicking up dirt leaves Schmitt queasy . " We 're not interested in anything that would bring big crowds here , " he says . <p> The dimensions of the military 's environmental quagmire keep widening . As its budget shrinks , the Pentagon wants to add 4.5 million acres to bases in Western states , arguing that the broader reach of modern weaponry like the F-4 bomber and the Bradley Fighting Vehicle requires more space for testing and training . Where 4,000 acres was once enough for a World War II-style tank and infantry exercise , Army generals say they now need 80,000 . Ranchers and environmentalists  --  never close allies  --  have been fighting what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the military should be scaling down . " I see what is happening now as a case of empire building , " says Robert Fulkerson of Citizens Alert , a Nevada watchdog group . Expansion , they fear , will do more than increase the military 's presence . It will open new frontiers for what has long been a reckless stewardship of the land . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Nasty surprises : Collecting shells of a different sort on the Vineyard ( top ) , warning in Denver <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Caution  --  Possible Contaminated area <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : ' The harder we look , the more we find ' : Treating contaminated water in Minessota <p> BY BILL TURQUE AND JOHN MCCORMICK <p> A TRAIL OF DEFENSE POLLUTION <p> Generating hundreds of thousands of tons of hazardous waste yearly , the military is the nation 's most pervasive and protected polluter .
