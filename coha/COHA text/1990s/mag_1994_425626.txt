<p> Flames from a cattle rancher 's torch spread along the surface of the cerrado , incinerating the low-lying vegetation and replacing nature 's colors with black . Within a few weeks , however , green shoots broke through the seemingly barren soil as lush grass and wildflowers accustomed to this cycle of life in the savanna regenerated from roots buried deep and protected from the fire . <p> Maria Werneck de Castro was in her fifties when she first took in the sight of the burning savanna . Five decades of life had taken her to all parts of Brazil , but it was the beauty and uniqueness of the cerrado that touched her most deeply . For twenty years she had worked tirelessly as an anatomical illustrator , sketching human organs for scientific documentation . Now , like the grass of the cerrado , she was remade . <p> Werneck 's life began in the city of Vassouras in the state of Rio de Janeiro on August 24 , 1905 , one of five children born to Luiz Werneck Texeira de Castro and Maria Albuquerque de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee artistocracy during the Brazilian empire ( 1821-89 ) , held seven plantation in the coffee-rich Paraiba valley . The plantation owners , known as " coffee barons , " or baroes do cafe , because so many of them had been granted titles by the Emperor Dom Pedro II , managed to maintain a life-style appropriate to their station long after the empire ceased to exist . This strongly influenced Werneck 's early education and provided her first exposure to art . " It was expected that children of nobility would attend art sessions . At age fifteen , I began learning art by imitating old Dutch and German prints . " <p> Werneck received direction for her artistic skills in 1940 when she was introduced to Professor Raymundo Honorio of the Manguinhos Institute . Here she adapted her natural artistic talent to the technical skills necessary for scientific illustration , specifically pathological anatomy . Artist Dulce Nascimento , who has known her since 1981 , says , " Mrs. Werneck has such a deep sensitivity ; it is difficult to imagine her in an operating room surrounded by surgical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reproduced likenesses of human organs to accompany the written work of doctors for almost twenty years . It became clear that scientific illustration provided Werneck with an outlet for her skill and her desire to lend her support to important research . Although she had found direction , she did not find inspiration until she was transferred to the budding capital of Brasilia in 1958 . Here , in the center of the cerrado , she became a botanical illustrator , a career that not only became her passion but also became the cerrado 's and Brazil 's gain . <p> " Botanical illustration is more difficult than anatomical drawing , " Werneck points out . " Organs all basically look the same , but plants are all individuals . " The conditions for the work are more difficult as well . Much of her work was done in the field , fighting off the sun , the heat , and the insects , while racing to capture the details of the plant before the light fades or , worse , the plant dies . " If the plant dies while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> First sketching lightly in pencil , then adding color , her manner of illustration is similar to what the Japanese call the " dry brush " technique . Alice Tangerini , staff illustrator for the Department of Botany , National Museum of Natural History , at the Smithsonian Institution , in Washington , D.C. , describes the procedure : " The brush acts almost as a pencil . Just enough water is applied to carry the watercolor to the paper , creating a tight , exacting effect . " <p> " To be successful as an illustrator , you must focus on every level of the plant from the front to the back  --  unlike photography , which can clearly show only one area of the plant at a time , " Tangerini continues . " Mrs. Werneck 's work on the Ficus clusiifolia demonstrates her ability as a draftsman . Her Dorstenia amazonica shows the lifelike quality of her detail , the drooping of the leaves and their venation . She combined the precision of the dry brush style with the broad , sweeping style of the ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During the early 1960s , Werneck recreated living plants on paper for a number of clients . She painted cerrado plants for the botanist Ezequias Paulo Heringer , with the Botanical Department at the University of Brasilia , including an extensive series of Hevea , or rubber trees . But these efforts proved frustrating . The Hevea paintings went unused , and she was often asked to handle administrative tasks that took her away from her illustrations . Fortunately , Dr. Alcides da Rocha Miranda , of the University of Brasilia 's Central Institute of Art , became aware of her abilities and employed her to do studies of local vegetation for landscape use . <p> The orchidophile Guido Pabst , director of the Herbarium Bradeanum , asked her to reproduce a species of Orchidaceae , and in 1968 wrote of her accomplishment : " The Cyrtopodia are very difficult and the exact , naturetrue paintings were in several cases the only means to determine the correct specimens received in . . . dried herbarium form .

Dr. Carauta  --  " an extraordinary scientist , " raves Werneck  --  fanned her interest in flora to new heights , introducing her to the wide variety of endangered Dorstenias . " She came to us with a love of the natural and of the plants , " he says . " It was a good match . " <p> " The relationship between the artist and the botanist is crucial ; it must be intense and strong to be successful , " Werneck explains . " The botanist knows the secrets of the plants and orients the artist . The artist then creates the exact drawing needed to illustrate the scientific study . " Throughout her botanical career , Werneck preserved on paper disappearing species of plants in the Atlantic forests and the cerrado , sometimes without even knowing the plant 's eventual fate . As the savanna region around Brasilia became more and more developed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population , and her awareness of the threat to the flora became acute . In 1981 , in her midseventies , she devoted herself exclusively to recording endangered species of cerrado plants . <p> The largest savanna ecosystem in South America and the second largest biogeographical region in Brazil , the cerrado covers 25 percent of the country . Only Amazonia occupies more territory . With consistently high temperatures and alternating wet and dry seasons , plant life adapts to climatic extremes by developing deep root systems . <p> Werneck 's love of flowers has no better home ; the richness and variety of cerrado plant life is second to none . There are about four hundred flowering species per two-and-a-half acres . But 37 percent of the .6 million square miles have been radically transformed by agriculture , reservoirs , deforestation , or urban development , and about half of the remaining land has been modified by human use . Only a fraction of the region is protected in national or state parks or in private reserves . <p> Dr. Cleber Alho , senior program officer for the World Wildlife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cerrado : " Much of the attention goes toward protecting the rain forest , especially the Amazon , and government behavior regarding land use is that the cerrado is not as important as the rain forest . " The flatness of the land allows it to be easily converted to soybean plantations or to be exploited for coal production . <p> According to Dr. Alho , the cerrado has many values beyond the botanical diversity . The forests that crisscross the savanna provide essential corridors for the movement of plants and animals from one biome to another . More importantly , branches of many of Brazil 's major river systems  --  the Amazon and the Sao Francisco included  --  are located in the cerrado , and protecting this region means preserving the quality of their water . <p> Werneck 's sadness at the cerrado 's losses shows in her short anecdotes that carry the straightforward wisdom of fables : " I have seen things of exceptional beauty while traveling through the interior . In Goias state , in the Douradinho Mountains , I came upon a large stone in perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by dynamite  --  in the name of progress . African cultures respect balancing stones as miracles of the planet . " <p> Werneck officially stopped painting in 1990 at the age of eighty-five after twenty years of anatomical and thirty years of botanical illustration . In the last nine years of her professional career , she documented dozens of endangered plants . The exact number may never be known , for her paintings reside in many locations , with many botanists , in many institutions . <p> Her illustrations have been infrequently exhibited . Botanical artists work to further scientific study ; they do not choose this outlet for their abilities to gain recognition . Since the time of Greek artists Krateuas , Dionysius , and Metrodorus in the first century B.C. , individual illustrators have been associated with their craft . Support for and public interest in botanical illustration grew through the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries , eventually peaking in the nineteenth . Some of the finest and most famous painters in the field practiced during this era  --  Nicolas Robert , Pierre-Joseph Redoute , and Georg Ehret . Talented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of kings . <p> The twentieth century , however , has seen botanical illustration slip again into the shadows of the art world . And , although Brazil 's flora is the subject of the most famous contemporary scientific artist , Margaret Mee , most artists who visit the country or call it home work strictly within the scientific community . Werneck typifies this ethic for , as Nascimento notes , she " does not like to see her paintings hung on the wall as a decoration . She is much more satisfied when she sees them being used by botanists or published in scientific books . " It is not surprising then that few outside of the scientific community know of her work . Like the cerrado 's , the importance of her legacy seems to be discerned primarily by scientists themselves . <p> Dr. Jose Neistein , executive director of the Brazilian-American Cultural Institute in Washington , D.C. , however , sees great import in Werneck 's work . " First of all , the high quality of her work has great documentary value . Some of the plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the next few years . Second , she has been able to inspire a new generation of artists . It is quite extraordinary given the difficult conditions under which they must work and the lack of monetary reward or public recognition . Still , they have inherited her ideals , her seriousness , and her professionalism . " <p> Nascimento agrees : " She influences a group of people who are developing day by day , following her example of honesty and high quality . Although she keeps repeating that she is not a teacher , she is ready to orient anyone who needs information . " Herself one of Werneck 's most established students , Nascimento is an excellent symbol of this potential . A graduate of the School of Fine Arts at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro and a Margaret Mee Foundation scholar , she now does botanical illustrations of endangered flora of the Rio de Janeiro coastline for the Parks and Gardens Foundation . <p> " One day , Mrs. Werneck gave me a gift , " Nascimento recalls . " It was a book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , completely empty . In the dedication she wrote that it was meant as a notebook where I would write about my works and adventures . It was the most subtle way she found to say how she was sure that a life full of experiences was coming to me . If they do n't happen , I must make them happen because the book was there waiting for observations and reflections . " <p> The writing that fills those pages will reflect the legacy of Maria Werneck de Castro . As those blank , white pages await a description of Nascimento 's future , they also await word on the future of the cerrado and the rest of Brazil 's wilderness . n <p> PHOTO : Maria Werneck <p> PHOTO : Maria Werneck 's art work . <p> PHOTO : Ficus clusiifolia Schott , 1989 . <p> PHOTO : Pavonia alnifolia St. Hil , 1987 . <p> PHOTO : Ficus auriculata Loureiro , 1983 . <p> PHOTO : Heliconia rostrata , 1985 , is an Amazon rain forest species that has pendulous inflorescence .
