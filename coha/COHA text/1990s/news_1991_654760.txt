<p> TO the legend of Lincoln 's log cabin must be added the story of President Truman 's upright piano . That tinkly little parlor instrument was a friend to young Harry as he grew up near Independence , Missouri . On it he first played his favorite little pieces by Mozart , Muzio Clementi , and some of those new " ragtime " composers . He played it when he courted his wife-to-be , Bess . And even if he never grew very accomplished as a musician - sometimes " his fingers would n't work , " as his daughter Bess put it - its music stayed with him for the rest of his life . <p> " Music occupied a place of importance in his private and public lives , " wrote Brian Lingham in his book , " Harry Truman - The Man , His Music . " " He involved his family , his friends , his political cronies , and finally the nation in his music . " <p> I have visited that old upright piano many times in the basement of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to resist picking out a few notes of " The Missouri Waltz " on the brittle keyboard . The instrument is like Truman in his later years - small , a bit battered , but still standing its ground . If you sit at the bench and listen carefully , you can almost hear Harry as a child , his stubby fingers scrambling across the keys . <p> " There are eight pianos here in all , " says Dr. Benedict Zobrist , the library 's director . " We have a full range of them . They go from this upright that President Truman played when he was a boy - all the way up to the presidential piano he played in the White House , which was a gift from President Nixon . We have a number of other pianos that he had at home and which were gifts to the president . " <p> Dr. Zobrist tells me young Truman was very serious about music . In 1891 while a young piano student , Truman went with Mrs. E.C . White , a Kansas City teacher who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear the legendary virtuoso , Ignaz Paderewski . Backstage after the concert , the legend goes , Paderewski gave Harry a brief lesson in the performance of his famous " Menuet in G. " There they were , fussing over the keyboard , two future statesmen - Truman a president of the United States and Paderewski a prime minister of Poland ! <p> For the rest of his life Truman was never far from a piano . In the White House he kept a Steinway Model " O " Grand in his office . He played for Stalin and Churchill during several postwar conferences , including the Potsdam Conference on July 19 , 1945 . While traveling through Salzburg in 1956 he played Mozart on several instruments - the 250-year old organ in the cathedral and the delicate piano in Mozart 's home . <p> He had many musical partners , performing with virtuoso Eugene List , and numerous celebrities like Lauren Bacall , Jimmy Durante , Jack Benny , and President Nixon . Few pianists have ever had a larger audience than the spring of 1952 when he performed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remodeled White House . <p> Over the years he gathered a treasure-trove of musical memorabilia , all housed in the Truman Library . There is a broad variety of original scores , manuscripts , and other items from all over the world - Duke Ellington 's manuscript of " Portrait of New York Suite , " which had been commissioned in 1950 by Arturo Toscanini ; Irving Berlin 's manuscript of the song , " It Gets Lonely in the White House " ; and first editions of Schubert songs bearing the composer 's signature . But for Truman himself , the most treasured item was an elegant Great Golden Mozart Medal of the City of Salzburg , presented to him on Oct. 4 , 1951 . It is the city 's highest award for " outstanding service in the field of music . " <p> Since 1984 a series of public concerts in Independence , Missouri , have paid tribute to Truman as a " musical statesman " and friend to music . This year , on May 8 , pianist Andre Watts will perform the Brahms Piano Concerto No. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Highly eclectic affairs , as doubtless the president would have wanted , they have featured the Kansas City Symphony in performance with virtuoso pianists like Daniel Pollack and Lorin Hollander , personalities like Victor Borge and Walter Cronkite , violinist Itzhak Perlman , jazz composer David Amram , and all-city choruses . <p> " I was just beginning my concert career in 1955 , " Pollack told me during his appearance at the first Truman Concert . He has been a prize-winner in the International Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow and in 1983 became the first pianist to play for a joint session of Congress . " I had won the Josef Lhevinne Memorial Scholarship and President Truman was the honorary patron . I presented him with a copy of a recording by his favorite pianist , Josef Lhevinne , with Madame Lhevinne 's autograph . He was delighted and for the next 10 years we corresponded . He had a keen interest in my career as well as many other pianists who were his friends ... I have always been grateful for that . " <p> When pianist-comedian Victor Borge came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missed the president : " I find myself wishing that he could be in the audience again , " Borge told me on that occasion . He spoke to me at the keyboard during his rehearsal with the Kansas City Symphony . " He heard me on several occasions , and I 'll never forget it . We agreed not to tell each other what we thought of our playing ! " <p> Another concert guest artist was composer David Amram , a self-styled " pied piper " who , with garlands of flutes and ocarinas around his neck , presented the world premiere of his symphonic piece , " Across the Wide Missouri " at the 1984 Truman Concert . On the same program appeared Willie Stargell , formerly of the Pittsburgh Pirates . He narrated Aaron Copland 's " A Lincoln Portrait . " <p> They were quite a pair when I met them both on the day of the concert . Together , they epitomized a blend of popular and classical elements that was typical of Truman . <p> " I saw him light the White House Christmas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington , D.C. , " recalled Amram . " In fact , he was the first president , or first public figure during World War II and later , who made us kids see that playing music was an important and admirable thing . " <p> Stargell 's reaction to the occasion ? " Outrageous ... I do n't know anything about music , except that I love it . And when you can combine folk music and jazz , that 's something ! But nothing in baseball could prepare me for this ! This is a whole new career for me ! " <p> Perhaps these concerts can ignite for younger generations the same spark of musical interest that Truman evoked in people like Amram and Pollack . That is more important than ever these days , says Washington Post critic Emeritus Paul Hume - when it seems the government is increasingly turning its back on the arts . Hume , of course , is that same gentleman who tangled with Truman in several public forums over the relative merits of Margaret Truman 's singing voice . Yet when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had nothing but affection for the president and his musical tastes : <p> " Well , I think it always helps any time that the president ... helps make some move into the realm of the arts that in any way supports them . The kind of things that the Kennedys did with such brillance and real understanding ... Mr. Truman was very generous about the arts and he appreciated great artists . Sometimes , he might not have understood their art from the inside - but he had a very real amateur 's love of it . " <p> TRUMAN had a big musical secret , by the way . By now , I suppose , everybody is in on it . But , for the record , Dr. Zobrist offers his own account : <p> " He did n't particularly care for the ' Missouri Waltz . ' His favorite waltz was the ' Blackhawk Waltz . ' Truman 's own performance of the piece is preserved in the library . Although Mr. Truman many times had no problems saying exactly how he felt about pieces , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was apologetic because he realized it was the Missouri State Song . But he did say once : ' It 's a ragtime song and if you let me say what I think , I do n't give a damn about it . But it is the state song of Missouri . As far as music is concerned , it 's as bad as the ' Star-Spangled Banner . " '
