There must be some mistake . I am standing in a small dingy , windowless chamber fitted with what appear to be two old wooden electric chairs cast off a grade B movie set . They are even electrically rigged , the wires running down under the cheap carpet and across the hall to a console hidden in a closet-size space . I have flown 3,000 miles and hiked across the huge University of Washington campus to ... this ? I was expecting something flashier , some tangible sign of the drama playing in here when the research is in session . " This much I will tell you , " one of its proprietors , psychologist Neil Jacobson , Ph.D. , had said conspiratorially months before , " anger has nothing to do with it . " He was talking about domestic violence  --  specifically the latest " hard " evidence from this laboratory , where he is recording every physiologic flicker of violently distressed couples as they light into topics that , at other times and places , generally lead to blows . In the scheme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do ( focusing on the couple relationship is seen by some as implying that women somehow collaborate in their own abuse ) . It is possibly even a dangerous thing to do . But it appears to contradict the little anyone really knows about spouse abuse  --  that anger is to batterers what acrylics are to painters . It is hard to believe that this dreary little room is one of the major fronts in a revolution now unfolding in thinking about and looking at why men batter the women they love . It is part of a seismic shift in the whole field of psychology  --  a new awareness that all behavior unfolds in a specific context , and it is necessary to understand the context in order to understand the behavior . For decades , the puzzle of spouse abuse has been summed up in the question , " Why do they stay ? " As if that were all there is to it  --  the manufacture of a gender hierarchy that encourages men to demonstrate their dominance . But the question is misogynistic ; it fails to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and batteree there is a relationship , and a very powerful one . It has a dynamic that stubbornly defies what is well known at the nation 's 1,300 shelters for abused women : the vast majority of battered women return to their abusers . If intellectual curiosity is not enough of a reason , then certainly protecting women requires that their marriages finally be probed . Researchers and clinicians ( many of them hard-core feminists ) now peering into the very heart of domestic violence find , even to their own surprise , that it is far more complex , and far less dark , than most had imagined . In a turnabout that might just as well serve as a symbol of all else that is now being learned , the crucial question turns out not to be , " Why do they ( the women ) stay ? Rather , it is what makes them ( the men ) so vulnerable , so dependent ? " Violence may indeed reflect patriarchy run amok and men may indeed use violence to exert power and control over women . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domestic violence : It almost always arises from feelings of powerlessness . Men experience their own use of force as a loss of control . Abusers do not enjoy being abusers . " These men give women too much power  --  to take care of all their needs , to solve their loneliness , for example . They expect women to be their psychic nurses , " reports family therapist Virginia Goldner , Ph.D . This is just one of the many paradoxes one must now entertain about domestic violence to see it clearly . In the whole new picture of domestic violence that is emerging , spouse abuse looks a lot like a very strange onion  --  the product of many forces operating and interacting at many levels between an individual and his environment . There are intimations of influences at the biological level , including disturbances in the activity of the neurotransmitter serotonin , high levels of testosterone production prompting men to aggression , possibly frank brain damage from head injury . There are elements that work at the cognitive level , like a propensity to misread social cues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in interpersonal skills , like a lack of ability to deescalate the conflict that is inevitable in relationships . There are intrapsychic deficits  --  a hypersensitivity to abandonment , inability to control negative emotions , and poor impulse control . And , of course , there are general cultural contributions like the traditional role structure of marriage . Just when one thing is true at one level , its opposite appears to be true at another . Among the many provocative findings shaping a new , more holistic view of domestic violence : * Apart from the coercion , the relationship between batterer and partner has a positive side . It is typically a highly romantic and deeply loving relationship . Both are drawn by the fantasy and reality of having found acceptance for the first time in their lives and feel their relationship is " special , " a unique haven from an outside world . " They are Hansel and Gretel , " says Goldner , a faculty member at New York 's Ackerman Institute for Family Therapy . * Not every interaction , not even every argument , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to be uniquely troublesome in these relationships . Violent men seem to have deficits in processing social information in specific situations  --  typically , they negatively misinterpret their wives ' behavior when , for example , she pays attention to anyone else . Such situations induce an inner panic because they hint at rejection . " These men are very dependent on their wives , " explains Amy Holtzworth-Munroe , Ph.D. , a psychologist at Indiana University . " They constantly want their wives ' attention . If they sense signs of rejection , they experience it as a real threat . Violence is related to jealousy and security of attachment . If they think their partners might leave , they become violent . " * But all batterers are not alike . For Neil Jacobson , family psychologist and behaviorist , studies in which he conducts blow-by-blow analyses of arguments turn up at least one " very scary " group of men  --  about 20 percent of batterers  --  for whom violence does not seem to be the result of rage at all . He calls them " autonomic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority of batterers , they do not show any signs of nervous system arousal in situations of conflict  --  their heart rates go down even when engaging in the clashes that give rise to abuse . " There is a disconnection between their physiology and their behavior  --  they are inwardly calm but outwardly contemptuous , belligerent , demeaning , verbally abusive . This dissociation of physiology from emotion is extraordinary  --  no one 's ever seen such a thing before . We think it may be a clue to the disorder of battering . It may be due to some traumatic experience in early childhood . Most of these men all witnessed high levels of violence among their parents . " * Without deflecting responsibility for male violence , it is possible that batterers are also somehow biologically different . " I started from a straight feminist perspective , " reports family therapist Gillian Walker , M.S.W. , also at the Ackerman Institute . " I 've had to broaden the lens as I go . I 'm struck by how many of these men are learning-disabled . Or how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids . " One psychologist finds that head injury increases by sixfold the likelihood a man is to physically abuse his partner . It is the most significant predictor there is. * The stereotype of battered wives as fragile , passive , placating , docile , and self-deprecating does not do justice to their actual role in relationships . Women prove to be the more functional members of these couples . What 's more , during confrontations , they reciprocate anger and contempt tit for tat and do n't back down . They do not act as if they fear being beaten later . But no matter what they try , once the violence starts , nothing they do can stop it . " The wives are beaten , " says Seattle 's Jacobson , " but not beaten into submission . " * Most women in battering relationships are themselves violent , a fact that has proved very politically troublesome to victims ' advocates . But Jacobson 's studies provide powerful proof that their violence occurs only in response to their partners ' attacks . Fear turns out to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produces fear in a partner , " reports Jacobson . " He has the unique capability to subjugate his partner by battering . That 's why I ca n't believe in husband abuse . " It 's hard to make sense of statistics about domestic violence . Advocates of all stripes lob statistics that verge on the hysterical  --  it is increasing , it always increases , and violence always escalates in a relationship : Today 's pushes are tomorrow 's punches . However , the need to stop domestic violence is not diminished by what the research community accepts as fact : The incidence of domestic violence is not increasing . It has always been high ; only an idealized view of the family has prevented us from seeing it until recently . There is no central reporting mechanism on spouse abuse , but two respectable national surveys suggest it decreased slightly between 1975 and 1985 . No matter how domestic abuse has thrived behind closed doors  --  and it thrives on isolation and privacy well as on patriarchal attitudes , rigid gender arrangements , acceptance of aggression in other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is increasingly less tolerated today . Rising public and professional interest could make it a watershed issue in American society . It could wind up as the proving ground for a new way of thinking about many complex social problems , where we accept , finally , that major problems almost always have a social context but that does n't mean they have a social cause . As Virginia Goldner and colleagues at the Ackerman Institute are proving , it is indeed possible to explain , even treat abusive behavior while regarding it as inexcusable and holding perpetrators fully responsible for their actions . Goldner and Gillian Walker inhabit a very sharp edge in psychotherapy . They are developing a " feminist/systemic approach to the conjoint therapy of battering . " In other words , they believe battering can best be stopped by seeing couples and helping them reconstruct the relationshipwithout letting batterers get away with a damn thing . The emphasis is on feminist and conjoint , because in traditional feminist circles , the two are incompatible . In fact , in some states where advocates have a strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among them  --  conjoint therapy is illegal for spouse abuse . They jumped in because there are many battered women who want to keep the relationship , albeit without the violence . " How can the victims of violence who have elected conjoint treatment speak and enjoy justice when perpetrators ' truths are judged equal ? " as systemic thinking requires , Goldner asks . But she 's a respected feminist who , after much soul-searching , reflected the polarities of either/or thinking about domestic violence in favor of " the more difficult , but more hopeful , stance of both/and . " She has reconciled herself to " recognizing the value of competing and contradictory perspectives . " As any good family therapist knows  --  as does any honest married soul  --  all relationships inherently involve competing perspectives . Goldner 's absolute requirement is that abuse must stop before therapy can begin , and the men must take complete responsibility for the battering  --  something they are always trying to foist off on their partners . Goldner and Walker begin by telling a couple , " We are experts in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is suitable for . We are saying , by implication , " We 're not yet in the role of therapists , we 're consultants , evaluating you to see whether you 're suitable to be our clients . ' This is n't a trick ; we devised it as a way to avoid getting involved in unsuitable cases . But it unexpectedly proved a powerful therapeutic tool . Couples know we 're the court of last resort , we 're experienced , and we 're as good as it gets . They feel they are on trial . They want to pass the test . " The test is that the violence must stop , unconditionally , and there must be a bond , a loving side to the relationship . Of course they secure the woman 's safety , which may mean having her live for a time at a shelter . " What distinguishes my work is that I am looking at key features of the romantic relationship between violent men and their partners . It is an open secret that partners go back to each other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone who hurts them , " says Goldner  --  until the therapists point out that there is also a loving side to the relationship . This is itself an important step in the therapy ; it strips away the shame women feel about being in an abusive relationship . That , in turn , helps restore a woman 's dignity , and nullifies the binding power of what has been experienced until now as a secret alliance . The woman is then free to begin fighting for new terms in the relationship . Others have described a honeymoon phase after the violence , a redemptive moment both partners experience as a bond . But Goldner feels the partners are drawn more by the fantasy and reality of having found acceptance . " Each feels the other knows them more profoundly and accepts them better than anyone before . " That , of course , is a commentary on what went on before . " Almost all the men we 've treated come from families where there was physical violence . The women do n't necessarily come from violent households but from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the abused boy are two lost souls who do n't trust the world outside . The paradox is they only feel safe together . " This romanticism works until real life enters . Say , he wants sex and she does n't . In their therapy , Goldner and Walker have developed a line of relentless questioning from multiple angles that separates the " many strands of meaning , memory , and feeling " that they find " packed " into the explosive moment . " When a man says " I just saw black " or " I felt a fire in my veins , " the specific conflicts are unavailable to him . But they are there . " Repeated inquiries about his life story capture the violence in slow motion . This technique gets the men to see not only that they have made a choice to hit , but they are full of conflicts that center on deep ambivalences about gender roles . These men are themselves victims of " gendered premises of masculinity . " They are engaged in constant denial of " feminine " vulnerabilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Goldner has written , " in remembering the escalation that precedes the violent moment , the men often describe an internal struggle between unmanly feelings and macho feelings occurring in rapid-fire alternation . " Only by unpacking a man 's globalized experience of rage , unraveling the sequence of steps that end in violence , can he begin to see the issues that ignite his fury and begin to take charge of his reactivity . " We see that some large vulnerability activates into the abusive rage . There is a deep disturbance in the person , and he believes it is the female 's job to soothe him , to keep him at bay . He sees her job as to make him feel powerful , to attend to him , to meet all his needs , when he wants . If not , that 's when there is violence . " These men hate it when their wives go out with friends . Anything that separates her from him means he has to deal with the large , empty space in his interior . We insist that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he will survive . We pull them apart psychologically . We address his psychological experience , that she has too much power , too much power to hurt him . We 'll tell him , " You 're relying too much on her . You need to take care of yourself . As long as you give her the power to solve loneliness , you 're giving her too much power and you 'll hit her . You must solve that alone . ' ' " Seven years into the Gender and Violence Project , Goldner and Co. think they 've got a form of therapy down pat that reliably gets the violence to stop yet gives couples what they want  --  each other , but not at the cost of their selves . They see a couple three or four times on a consultation basis , in which time the violence is teased apart until the men can grasp what they have done  --  and what they have done to their partner . Then the couples are seen about six times in a treatment mode . Of all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 30 ) there has been only one instance of hitting that occurred after treatment started . " And that was during a six-week hiatus in treatment over the holidays , " Goldner is quick to point out . But there are questions whether this therapy model is usable by others . Goldner has an unmistakable presence that may help deter violence in the couples she treats . Still , she is now trying to teach what does to another set of therapists . If she succeeds , We will be able to send this therapy out to other mental-health centers . " While Goldner 's work is dazzlingly insightful , to say nothing of intellectually demanding , researchers leap to suggest the possibility of flaws in her observations . She does n't use comparison groups ; as a result , elements that appear to be linked to violence could in fact be due to extreme marital distress , a typical feature of violent relationships . Indiana 's Amy Holtzworth-Munroe is also looking closely , though scientifically scrupulously , at the men in violent couples . She measures them against two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar levels of conflict and distress but do not resort to violence , and one of happy couples . Still , there is remarkable resonance in the findings . Whatever else leads a man to violence , it operates only in certain specific situations , says the Indiana psychologist . In her research , she asks men what they would say or do in response to certain problematic marital situations presented by audiotape . These test the skills people use to decode social information and generate appropriate responses . A competent response is " one that would solve the current problem and make problems of the same type less likely in the future . " Like negotiating mutually agreeable compromises and explaining thoughts and feelings . Threatening statements or behaviors , name-calling , and sarcasm lead the list of " incompetent " responses . Only the maritally violent men provide incompetent responses to situations involving jealousy  --  " at a social gathering , your wife is talking to another man and they are smiling and laughing . " Or " you receive a phone call from a man who asks for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not leave a name or number . " In such situations , violent men consistently misinterpret their wife 's actions as having been done with hostile intent . This is an extraordinarily important piece of information to have , not just because it points to a distinguishing flaw in these men . But because attributing hostile intent to a wife 's behavior  --  to anyone 's behavior  --  gives men a way to justify violence . It becomes the grease for the machinery by which they try to shift blame : " She was trying to hurt me/provoke me .... " The violent men also do not generate competent responses in situations that represent rejection or abandonment from the wife  --  a vignette , say , in which she is not interested in her husband 's sexual advances or wants to spend time with friends . Nor do they do well in situations where a wife challenges or embarrasses her husband  --  she questions his judgment or wants him to cancel plans with friends . " The data show that violent men repeatedly go into abusive relationships , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women . The husband is the problem . What we 're finding is that we have to fix these men at the individual level as well as at the societal and couple level . These men do not have the social skills to participate in the culture . " She has proof their problems carry over to nonmarital situations as well . When the maritally violent men listen to vignettes of assorted nonmarital situations  --  involving bosses , coworkers , and friends  --  the same deficits in social skills show up . " They have a general deficit , although the marital situations are more arousing . " Holtzworth-Munroe sees the rejection-jealousy issue as one of the keys to domestic violence . " These men appear to be more dependent on their wives . If they sense signs of rejection , they experience it as a real threat . We are now applying measures of attachment . Violent men are more preoccupied with the marital relationship than other men . They have a narrower focus on their wife . They have few outside friends . They especially rely on their wives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they become violent . " My work implies that these men have screwed-up relationships with their own parents . They lack the ability to trust , something that comes out of secure early attachment " to a parent or other responsive caregiver . As a result , they fear loss , misinterpret neutral situations as threatening , see hostile intent when it does n't exist . There is a certain urgency to itemizing those situations that put men at greatest risk for violent responses . " We need to know where to focus our energy , " says Holtzworth-Munroe . " It 's clear from the evidence that most treatments do n't help . Probably they are applied too late , after violence is a set behavioral pattern . Once violence is used , it becomes reinforced  --  because it works . The men get what they want , though they may feel bad about doing it . " Neil Jacobson 's study of the marriages in which domestic violence takes place is entirely without precedent . It is the first study to include people with severe levels of physical violence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparison groups : 32 couples who have never used physical violence but whose marriages are equally unhappy , and 22 couples who are happily married . What 's more , he is looking directly at the couples during their arguments . He has them attempt to work out two problems they identify as troublesome . They do this for an intense 15 minutes while tethered to the aforementioned electric chairs by wires that monitor their physiology . Overhead videocameras record every word , every nuance of facial affect , voice tone , posture , and gesture . Marital violence , Jacobson finds , is not just an extreme form of argument . It 's something of a different genre altogether . The batterers look different from other men . They do things other men do n't do . In arguments they are highly emotionally aggressive  --  they are belligerent , contemptuous , demeaning . They lack any empathy for their partners . And in some ways , their wives are different , too . Just as the Eskimos allegedly have 28 words for " snow , " Jacobson feels that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Anger is common in unhappy couples . We find there are specific facets of anger and they differentiate the violent from the nonviolent . " In his atlas of anger , there 's garden-variety anger , a pure expression of affect with no attempt to control , as in " That really pisses me off ! " There 's belligerence , a taunting attempt to produce a negative response in another : " What are you gon na do about my drinking ? ! You do n't like it , huh ? Well , what are you gon na do about it ? " There 's contempt , full of demeaning and insulting remarks . There 's disgust . And critical disapproval . There 's demandingness and control , with hostile affect and tone . " Anger is shared by both partners in violent relationships , " says Jacobson . " Even the provocative types of anger . They taunt . They demean . They hurl contempt at each other even in nonviolent arguments . " The wives of domestic violence , for their part , are very , very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't back down . They greet negative statements with negative responses  --  what psychologists call negative reciprocity . Like their husbands , they do n't deescalate an argument if one gets started . " These women do n't look anything like the passive trauma victims others have described , " Jacobson reported at the recent convention of the American Psychological Association . " This is a more flattering portrait of the victims of wife abuse . They look courageous . " That , however , is the view from outside . Internally , things are not always what they seem , Jacobson discovered in a series of studies conducted with John M. Gottman , Ph.D . The wives of violent men are highly aroused physiologically . Their heart rate shoots up , just as one would expect of someone engaged in angry conflict . But , much to Jacobson 's surprise , among the violent men , heart rates actually go down during discussion of conflicts . In the normal response to conflict , the autonomic nervous system is activated . The cardiovascular system turns on . Heart rate goes up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 57  --  there is an extraordinary divergence between behavior and physiology . Behaviorally , they are full of anger  --  belligerent , dominating , verbally abusive . But internally they are exceedingly calm . Those who are the most calm physiologically are the most belligerent and contemptuous , and the most abusive verbally . They are also most likely to be violent outside the marriage as well as in it ; many have arrest records . And they are most likely to have a family history of violence . These men are not sensation-seeking , engaging in explosive behavior to get aroused ; they are not underaroused to begin with . " They are gaining autonomic control before striking in an emotionally aggressive manner , " says Jacobson . " They are like pythons . These men are scary . " Jacobson regards the disconnection between the physiological and emotional as a clue to a core defect in batterers . " It may be due to the early trauma of being around a violent environment . That could occur through some early , emotionally traumatic experience , or it could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the result of head trauma At the hands of people whose loving is supposed to be protective . Jacobson has spotlighted a way that violence  --  violence : a behavior !  --  can ricochet from generation to generation as assertively as a rogue gene . It 's possible that these men are so deeply , irrevocably , wounded , changed by experience , that they are even beyond the help of therapy . " Not every problem that exists is appropriate for psychotherapy , " notes Jacobson . The deceleration in heart rate in the face of a stressful situation also suggests that for some men , violence may not be a problem of impulse control at all , which is the traditional view . Rather , Jacobson speculates that the batterers are deliberately , manipulatively controlling what goes on in the marital interaction . " The only other known state in which there is a deceleration in heart rate is focused attention . These men look like they are being very attentive and focused . " In domestic violence , says Jacobson , " Women are fighting for survival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Jacobson was the discovery that heart rate went down , too , among a subgroup of men in distressed but nonviolent marriages . These men , however , were also more emotionally aggressive than the other nonviolent men . " We suspect that there may be some continuity from verbal to physical abuse . It looks like we 're tapping into an underlying substrate of aggression that may predict who becomes violent over time . " Two-year follow-up evaluations should reveal whether the nonviolent dissociators become physically violent with time , as the psychologist predicts . It is an axiom of family relations that women are the barometers of relationship distress . Normally in unhappy marriages , couples develop a communication pattern in which the woman tries to engage her partner while he retreats . She is seeking change . In this demand/withdraw pattern , the demand role signifies dissatisfaction . In violent relationships , there is a switch of roles and the husband shares the dissatisfied role . When wives are the dissatisfied partner , they get angry . When husbands are dissatisfied , the implications are different . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jacobson paints of battered wives  --  feisty , angry , returning negative statements , and extremely aroused internally  --  can differ so sharply from the conventional one of women silenced into a pathetic state of helplessness as a result of posttraumatic stress ? Jacobson also sees helplessness among battered wives but thinks it reflects their emotional responsiveness . " Usually you see people who are angry or psychologically distressed . These women are angry and distressed . They are verbally and emotionally aggressive . But they are also defensive , frightened , and sad . All their negative affects are heightened simultaneously . " The helplessness these women feel , he believes , comes as a result of physical trauma and the threat of trauma , and it is manifested by the activation of all of their negative emotions at the same time ; it 's confusing and debilitating . Plus the fact that once violence starts , nothing they do , even withdrawing , stops the physical abuse . In fact , attempts to withdraw may even provoke an escalation of the violence . When psychologist Alan Rosenbaum , Ph.D. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Medical Center to run the domestic violence research and treatment program , he was required to take a medical history in all abuse cases . Before long , he noticed a distinct pattern . Among a surprising number of the cases of marital injury he was recording an early history of head injury . Rosenbaum looked at 31 consecutive admissions to the marital violence program . In 19 of them  --  61 percent  --  there was in fact a history of significant head injury : loss of consciousness , a diagnosed concussion , or postconcussion symptoms . That was enough to warrant a grant for a more rigorous study . When the results were tabulated , abusive men were significantly more likely to have had head injury  --  53 percent , versus 25 percent among nonviolent men from unhappy marriages and 16 percent in the happily married . " Head injury increases the chance of marital aggression by a factor of six . That makes it the most significant predictor of marital violence that there is , " Rosenbaum says . He 's now following the fate of two groups of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other with orthopedic injury . And he 'll be measuring the incidence of marital violence in both groups over the next two years . At the same time , Rosenbaum is exploring the possibility that , among domestically violent men , there is some defect in the regulation of the brain chemical serotonin . A neurotransmitter widely dispersed in the brain , serotonin is thought to influence much of mental life . There is evidence to suggest that high levels of serotonin correlate with dominant behavior , while low serotonin levels are implicated in anxiety , general aggression , as well as impulsive behavior . Psychologist Roland Maiuro , Ph.D. , of the University of Washington , head of one of country 's leading domestic violence clinics , has been giving batterers a drug known to influence serotonin-sensitive paths  --  Paxil , first cousin of Prozac . " It seems to enhance the resiliency of these men , " Maiuro reports . " They 're less reactive . When confronted with the same " provocations , " they 're not activating as much . But they still need to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are no skills in pills . " A controlled study of the effect of Paxil on domestically violent men is about to get under way . " Right now , this is not a very politically correct model of domestic violence , " Rosenbaum offers . " But I 'm not suggesting that marital violence is caused by biological factors . We have to look at causes at several levels and see whether there are factors that make some men unable to regulate their impulses , that increase the likelihood of an aggressive response to any kind of negative stimulus , such as stress . " Marital aggression is very complex . We ca n't say there is one factor . No one factor applies to 100 percent of men . People become aggressive for a variety of reasons . These are some .
