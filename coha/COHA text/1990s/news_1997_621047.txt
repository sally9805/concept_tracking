<p> NOTORIOUS <p> The Life of Ingrid Bergman <p> By Donald Spoto <p> HarperCollins ; 474 pages ; $ 27.50 <p> Of the many delectable revelations that did not make Ingrid Bergman " notorious " during her lifetime , perhaps the most intriguing described by Donald Spoto in his exhaustive and mesmerizing biography is this small detail : <p> Bergman 's 1946 romance with war photographer Robert Capa formed the basis for the relationship of characters played by James Stewart and Grace Kelly in Alfred Hitchcock 's " Rear Window . " We get to think about this for a minute as Spoto spells it out , and then the fun of it  --  and the weight of it  --  sinks in . <p> " Miserably lonely " in her " dull , affectless " marriage to Petter Lindstrom  --  the dentist she had married at 18 in Sweden , now the dictatorial manager of her career  --  Bergman found both lover and soul mate in the adventurous , free-spirited Capa . For months the two " managed to evade the gossips " by meeting in New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Village bars , sipping drinks and listening to jazz ; they cuddled in the balconies of West Side movie theaters ; they strolled up Fifth Avenue at four in the morning . " <p> The truthful ring of this retelling reflects Spoto 's authority as Bergman 's most meticulous and forthcoming biographer . He not only was acquainted with Bergman personally and had interviewed her in depth during the last decade of her life , he also knew Hitchcock , who respected Spoto 's critical analysis ( in Spoto 's " The Art of Alfred Hitchcock , " still in print after 30 years ) and who was also interviewed by Spoto for one of the best biographies of the British director ( " The Dark Side of Genius " ) . <p> Spoto , who went on to write many more showbiz biographies ( see interview on page 2 ) , can so perfectly place a scene and unravel its significance in the life he is treating that even the more familiar events of Bergman 's life are depicted with fresh detail , and always with an eye on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spoto writes that Bergman fell so deeply in love with Capa that " she spoke of leaving her husband for him . " Despite rumors throughout her career that she was romantically involved with dozens of leading men ( Cary Grant , Spencer Tracy , Gary Cooper ) , she was lovers with none of them . Bergman fell for few men in her life , Spoto says . <p> " Ingrid may have relished the role of unfaithful woman onscreen , but in life she was uneasy with it , " Spoto writes . " In her world , one married the beloved ; she had once loved Petter but now only feared him . . . and now here was the unattached , available , seductive Capa . " <p> Like Kelly 's character in " Rear Window , " Bergman urged Capa to let her find him a position as a publicity photographer for a film studio . Capa scoffed at the notion of settling in as a house photographer for anyone and refused to commit himself to the relationship , finally telling Bergman they must call off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that constitutes one of the most touching scenes in the book . Preparing for the making of the film " Notorious , " Hitchcock and Bergman , by now close friends following their unusual collaboration in " Spellbound "  --  he atypically followed her advice on character motivation , Spoto says  --  the two sit down for what turns into a " boozy afternoon " of reflection . <p> During the talk , the ever-observant Hitchcock sees in Bergman 's features " a somewhat forlorn look and noted the absence of her usual ebullient good humor . Ingrid 's evident distraction Hitchcock rightly took for emotional turmoil . " Certainly he has his own emotions to hold in check : By this time , we know that Hitchcock himself has fallen in love with Bergman , and that she has graciously declined his attentions . <p> Now , " as Hitchcock poured hefty drinks for them , " Bergman confesses to her old friend that " she was in love with Robert Capa . . . ( and ) saw no hope for the fulfillment of that love . " Hitchcock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little speech from one of their movies ( quiz to reader : see if you can name the film ) : <p> " ' It is very sad to love and lose somebody , ' " Hitchcock recites . " ' But in a while you will forget and you will take up the threads of your life where you left off not long ago . And you will work hard . There is lots of happiness in working hard  --  maybe the most . ' " <p> The speech is from " Spellbound , " when the movie 's loving but curmudgeonly mentor , Dr. Brulov , tells the weeping Bergman , playing a psychiatrist who has seen her lover ( Gregory Peck ) jailed for a murder he did not commit , that she can be stronger than she knows . <p> Bergman 's eyes fill with tears as Hitchcock recites Brulov 's advice , but as Spoto points out , the words most painfully apply to him , too . " ( Hitchcock ) knew all too poignantly that . . . her work was with him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart was with him as a daughter and a friend . They were both , in a way , lost souls . " <p> " That quiet afternoon , they sat  --  allies in distress , sipping gin martinis , smoking too much and finding in their unspoken sympathies for each other the courage that comes from the deepest kind of love , a caring beyond the jungle of sex and into the clearer field of affection . " And of course , the ravenous , scrutinizing-filmmaker mind of Hitchcock stored Bergman 's revelations away for the future " Rear Window , " a film based on the Cornell Woolrich short story that originally " had no such love angle . " <p> It is a tribute to Spoto 's gifts as a biographer that the whole book is like this , full of wondrous behind-the-scenes intimacies and eye-openers that stun us on almost every page . <p> Even passing characterizations inspire a small gasp or two , as when Spoto reveals Bergman 's attraction to director Victor Fleming ( of " Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde " ) , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showing his displeasure " when his wife annoyed him . " A favorite gesture was to catch a fly or insect at the dinner table , season it , pop it into his mouth and chew noisily . If the poor woman left the table in tears , Fleming considered his stunt successful . " <p> These kinds of details make the book less a string of chronological events and more a study in character and psychology , relationship and genuine human drama . <p> By the time we reach the monumental occasions that did make Ingrid Bergman " notorious "  --  for example , her abandonment of husband Lindstrom and daughter Pia in 1949 for Italian directory Roberto Rossellini and the famous unwed pregnancy that followed  --  his meticulous research and critical analysis offer real insight . <p> What readers may remember as a worldwide expression of moral outrage over the Rossellini affair was in fact only an American obsession , Spoto writes . More than 58,000 articles in the United States were published against her for her sins . The rest of the world was attempting to recover from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempting to recover both its economy and moral rectitude in sending factory-working women back home after the war , was the only nation that reviled Bergman so deeply that it kept her in exile for years . <p> Other nations , especially Rossellini 's Italy and , Spoto notes , savoring the irony , the Vatican , welcomed the two lovebirds and celebrated the pregnancy . " Why do they talk about a scandal , " Spoto quotes an Italian priest who seems oblivious to his hypocrisy , " when God has been so good and blessed their union with a child ? " <p> Perhaps most telling in terms of her resilience and irrepressible humor , Bergman wrote a letter from Rome during the worst of her malignment in the States : <p> " All these holy men ( in the Vatican ) seem to have adopted Roberto as their favorite sinner . We have priests coming and going all the time and joining us for dinner . My reputation as a Lutheran is shot to pieces !

She died in 1982 , yet , thanks to Spoto 's deeply moving biography , will live forever in the hearts of readers of " Notorious . "
