<p> " Is that him ? " demanded the Protestant gunman as he scrambled off the back of the motorbike one evening last October and took aim at Pearse McKenna 's head . <p> The first bullet grazed McKenna 's scalp . The second caught him in the lower back as he dived behind a parked bakery truck . He rolled under the truck and waited for the gunman to finish the job . <p> " I could see the feet of the man coming after me , walking around the lorry looking for me , " McKenna would later recall . He escaped death only because the driver of the motorbike panicked and called the gunman back . <p> McKenna , who is Catholic , became yet another casualty in the bloodiest year of political violence here since 1982 . Just two days ago , seven more civilians died when the van in which they were riding was blown up by Irish Republican Army bombers , and the British government sent hundreds more troops to Northern Ireland on Saturday . <p> But McKenna 's shooting also illustrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are in the daily life of this province . <p> An outspoken union shop steward in a predominantly Protestant bakery , McKenna had objected to the display of British flags inside the workplace in violation of a local code . In many other countries , the dispute would have been settled on the shop floor or in court . But in Belfast , where word soon filtered to the neighborhood that a Catholic had insulted the Union Jack , it was settled on the street by a man with a gun . <p> After 23 years of political violence known here as " The Troubles , " most people decry sectarian killing  --  including some of those actively involved in it . But many have become resigned to it as a permanent part of the status quo . And behind their acceptance is Northern Ireland 's darkest secret : that the status quo is tolerated because it serves , in some way , many interests in this messy but manageable little war . <p> Even in a bad year , the dead number only about half of those killed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 20,000 jobs in the security forces here , most of which go to Protestants . It is at the root of more than $ 3 billion per year in subsidies that cushion Britain 's poorest province from the vicissitudes of recession . And local leaders invoke it to hold together fraying constituencies by giving the people something to fear and unite against . <p> " You 're safer here than you are on the streets of France or the sidewalks of New York , " said Tom Hadden , a prominent political scientist and commentator . " For many people life is quite good , especially if you 're a Protestant . The status quo is not comfortable , but it 's livable . So there 's no great hurry to do anything . Everyone says we do n't have to make a deal now . " <p> Northern Ireland has taken its place alongside Israel and South Africa as part of an Iron Triangle of protracted ethnic struggle . For years these trouble spots have seemed immune to efforts to resolve the fundamental conflict at the heart of each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursued in South Africa and the Middle East . Diplomats have devised peace plans , church leaders have bemoaned the violence , human rights groups have exposed abuses ; but none has unlocked what writer Albert Camus called the " fatal embrace " of two peoples  --  Protestants and Catholics , Israelis and Palestinians , whites and blacks  --  sealed by history and hatred , unable to live together or apart . <p> With the end of the Cold War , this sort of intractable ethnic conflict seems , if anything , to be spreading . In places as far removed as Canada , Yugoslavia , Liberia , Sri Lanka and the now-defunct Soviet Union , rival ethnic and religious forces are ripping societies apart at their seams . In this sense , Northern Ireland , Israel and South Africa are not stubborn exceptions to the new global order but harbingers of things to come . <p> " We 're in an era when proxy wars between the superpowers are coming to an end and the kind of communal violence epitomized by Northern Ireland , South Africa and Israel is taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the New York-based Human Rights Watch . " In some ways it 's a much more dangerous era because ideological conflict you can mediate , while communal conflict is often seen as non-negotiable . " <p> As a foreign correspondent for The Washington Post , I have spent most of the past decade covering the triangle and been struck over and over again by the echoes among the three . The analogy is tricky because each is historically and sociologically unique . But their dilemmas and evasions , their sense of siege and of entrapment in a winner-takes-all contest , their dreams and their nightmares are all in a fundamental way the same . And they are not only political struggles but personal ones , in which human emotions such as pride , anger , fear and humiliation play a crucial role . <p> This series takes a new look at these three enduring conflicts to assess what has changed  --  and what has not  --  in the post-Cold War era and the lessons they hold for a world transformed . <p> It begins in Northern Ireland , where Winston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The integrity of their quarrel is one of the few institutions that has been unaltered in the cataclysm which has swept the world . " <p> Churchill 's words still echo down the grimy streets of West Belfast , the modern locale for a struggle between the British and the Irish that began centuries ago . Since 1969 , when civil strife broke out anew between the Protestant majority and Catholics in the province , the IRA has waged a violent campaign to oust British forces and reunite Northern Ireland with the overwhelmingly Catholic republic to the south . Twenty-three years and nearly 3,000 deaths later , gunmen from the IRA and from their Protestant paramilitary opponents are still trading bombs and bullets with each other and with British security forces . <p> While the Berlin Wall and hundreds of miles of the former Iron Curtain have come tumbling down , the urban landscape in the working-class Protestant and Catholic neighborhoods here is still dominated by 60-foot-high watchtowers , reinforced concrete-and-steel security walls and razor-wire fences . <p> Security forces see the area as another country , enemy territory where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " sticks " of 10 , routinely aiming their automatic rifles at pedestrians and cars in anticipation of ambush . Police stations bristle with cameras and protective barriers , military helicopters hover overhead , and dozens of checkpoints spring up and disappear throughout the day . <p> Yet the bombers get through . The outlawed IRA recently launched a new bombing spree in downtown Belfast that featured a 600-pound car bomb that crumpled the front of the city 's largest hotel and ripped the roof off the local opera house . It was the kind of explosion Belfastians had not seen for years , and Christmas shoppers strolled past Glengall Street for weeks for a glimpse of the gaping crater.Bitter Humor <p> A stream of bitter humor is also part of the landscape . The 20-foot-high barrier dividing Catholic Clonard from Protestant Shankill is called the " Peace Line . " A pub near the spot where two British soldiers were dragged from their cars during a Catholic political funeral , beaten senseless and then shot in the head , is known locally as " The Corporals ' Rest . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one 's own home . <p> " Everything seems hunky-dory on the outside , but you scratch the surface and it 's a real nightmare , " said Peter Madden , a Catholic civil rights lawyer whose law partner , Patrick Finucane , was gunned down two years ago by a hit man who has never been arrested . <p> " The media try to portray this place as a normal society . The news bulletin starts with someone 's killing but it ends with a funny anecdote . On the surface , people are living in modern times , but they 're still passing down history from generation to generation . It 's ingrained and it 's frightening . " <p> A constant flow of martyrs ' blood drenches the ground . The IRA 's newest tactic was to target a hospital ; two months ago it bombed the military wing of a Belfast hospital , killing two soldiers and re-injuring a number of convalescing ones . A Protestant hit man revived an older method of attack three days before Christmas when he emptied most of his pistol into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy and shot him in the head . <p> The conflict claims its victims not only among the dead and wounded but also among those traumatized by years of violence . People generally look older than their years . They smoke too much and drink too much , laugh too loudly and too nervously . " You have to look at Northern Ireland as an education in human nature , " said Mina Wardle . " Otherwise , it 'll drive you crazy . " <p> Wardle lives on the Protestant side of the Peace Line in a tidy , red-brick row house on Argyle Street . Over the years she has been assaulted by armed men , cradled a dying taxi driver in her arms after a car bomb blew up his cab , and endured four armed robberies , a series of firebombs and the abduction of her husband by Protestant gunmen . <p> Outgoing and ebullient , Wardle became dependent on tranquilizers and developed severe agoraphobia  --  she refused to leave her house for seven months . " I felt if I sat in here for the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she recalled , gently laughing at the notion . <p> On trips to the hospital she discovered dozens of other women suffering the same anxiety . Now she helps operate a counseling service that provides discussion groups and therapy for women whose life stories are a chronicle of human erosion : Many have had children killed or husbands jailed or lost limbs for a cause few understand and even fewer believe in . <p> Wardle said that most of the people in her neighborhood feel betrayed , both by a British government that they believe finds Northern Ireland an unpleasant inconvenience and by their own leaders , whom they see as lacking the imagination or courage to take risks and make changes . <p> " You feel trapped between things , " she said . " You 're British but you 're peculiarly Irish . Both governments deny you . The British would give this lot away tomorrow , but Dublin wo n't take it . We 're an embarrassment to everyone . " <p> It is only a few blocks from Wardle 's home to the anonymous , whitewashed row @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West Belfast 's Catholic public housing projects . This is one of the city 's most " active " neighborhoods , where attacks on police and soldiers by the IRA are frequent and deadly . The male unemployment rate here is estimated at 85 percent , and violence and poverty are so raw that at one time Mother Teresa felt compelled to leave the slums of Calcutta for several months to set up a mission here . <p> Mary Nolan and her husband , Kevin , are involved in republican causes and they estimate their house has been searched by security forces more than 25 times over the past decade . The searchers are looking for guns , batteries , tools or anything else that could be used to ambush a patrol or build a homemade bomb . They have pulled up floorboards , ripped open walls , dismantled the brick fireplace , torn open the staircase and the kitchen cupboard , even removed the upstairs toilet bowl and run sniffer dogs throughout the four-bedroom house . The fact that they have never found any weapons does not seem to dull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " It 's not your home anymore , " Mary Nolan said . " They come when they like . You have no safeguard and no protection . It leaves a mental scar . My nerves are always shaking . " <p> At one point , she said , she threw out her rubber kitchen gloves because the police said they could be used to handle explosives . One day , when her 9-year-old son , Francis , came home with a toy walkie-talkie , " I jumped . I told him , ' Get that thing out of here . ' " <p> Although they are both victims of the violence , Mina Wardle and Mary Nolan are sealed off from each other geographically and politically . There is no hatred between them , but neither is there much sympathy . Each is too busy coping with her own losses to heed those of someone living on the other side of the Peace Wall . <p> They are also sealed off from political leaders who could negotiate an end to the conflict . Wardle can not compel Protestant politicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the IRA to suspend armed struggle . <p> " The politicians have bodyguards to protect them , " said Mina Wardle . " Why should they care what happens to people like us ? " <p> When it comes to the politics of violence in Northern Ireland , few hands are completely clean . The IRA clings to armed struggle because it says that is the only way of forcing the British to leave the province . But two decades of violence have not succeeded , and even some supporters admit that the armed struggle gives the IRA power and leverage within the Catholic community it otherwise would lack . <p> The moderate , predominantly Catholic Social Democratic and Labor Party led by John Hume opposes the IRA . But it too enjoys political clout and attention in places like London , Dublin and Washington that it might not merit were Northern Ireland just another British province with ordinary problems . <p> Similarly , the two main Protestant parties led by Ian Paisley and James Molyneaux maintain much of their own leverage through frequent denunciations of the IRA . Hume often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " from their vocabulary , they would be struck dumb . <p> The only major player who seems to draw little or nothing from the present arrangement is the British government . It pays out more than $ 3 billion per year in subsidies for security and economic development in the province and is frequently embarrassed when human rights groups , such as Amnesty International and Helsinki Watch , spotlight abuses by security forces and allegations of links with Protestant death squads . The British public is equally unimpressed : Although polls consistently show a clear majority in favor of military withdrawal , the issue hardly registers in electoral politics . <p> But Britain does not pull out . That is partly because of domestic politics ; both the ruling Conservatives and opposition Labor Party would be badly split by such a move . And it is partly because the British fear that the army 's departure could lead to a bloodbath much worse than the violence that brought troops there in the first place in 1969 . <p> Instead , Britain works the diplomatic margins .

Nonetheless , Brooke is trying again this month . He has , officials contend , no other choice . <p> " Getting out is not really an option , " said a senior civil servant . " Northern Ireland does n't really impinge on the consciousness of the mainland . The costs are not unbearable . The British public is actually pretty stolid about the whole thing . Even when the IRA attacks targets in Britain , the response is n't , ' Let 's rid ourselves of this problem , ' but rather , ' Let 's sort these characters out . ' " <p> A recent edition of Republican News , the newspaper of Sinn Fein , the legal political wing of the IRA , contained a moving tribute to Patricia Black-Donnelly . She was one of two IRA " volunteers " killed last month in the English town of St. Albans when the bomb they were rigging went off prematurely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " evil and wicked " terrorists . <p> The article described her childhood in West Belfast , her hatred of Britain 's " army of occupation " and her secret work as an IRA intelligence operative . It portrayed her as a warm , vibrant person : " She loved to laugh , she loved to dance and those who knew her recall her smile and her generosity of spirit . " <p> But perhaps the most poignant fact was that Patricia Black-Donnelly was only 18 years old . She was born four years after " The Troubles " began . Her anger and her hatred were those of a whole new generation of Northern Ireland children who were born into the conflict and are just now coming of age . And her death was a warning , like a bell tolling in a graveyard , of a war without end .
