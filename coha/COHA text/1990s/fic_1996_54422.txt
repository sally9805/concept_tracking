Leslie What 's short stories have appeared in Asimov 's , F &SF,; and several regional publications . She has just finished a mainstream novel , and promises more short fiction soon . <p> About " Uncle Gorby &; the Baggage Ghost , " she writes , " The search for self sometimes begins too late . My father 's death made me feel as if the one resource I needed was locked away in a private library , closed until further notice . I sometimes wonder if ghosts are n't reference materials , accessed by memory , imagination , and wishful thinking . In any case , I believe in ghosts , and always look forward to hearing from them  --  especially when they bring me good story ideas . " <p> Katya had been thinking about the little boy next door since the day last week when she had learned he had been fathered by a turkey baster . This knowledge had left her unable to enjoy her vacation , spent birding in Death Valley . <p> She deplaned and walked through the airport concourse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky than the sky . Katya stared past the floor-to-ceiling windows to the outside , where a commuter plane taxied in a shimmering haze of incomplete combustion . A plane circled and she watched , as if viewing a mirage from inside a glass of water . She imagined her goldfish , Vlad , saw the world this way : as liquid reality . <p> Vlad , with his tail rot and red-rimmed eyes , an unwelcome gift from Katya 's ex-lover . The fish had managed to survive her benign neglect for over a year . Vlad was probably at that moment peering out his curved bowl , begging the little boy next door for a serving of fish flakes . The boy had volunteered to watch Vlad while Katya was away . <p> She walked toward the baggage claim , but paused when she noticed several sets of imported Matryeshka dolls on the other side of the gift shop window . She slipped inside the shop to browse . One set of Matryeshkas , with Gorbachev on the outside , had been marked down by half . The newer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his belly . Soon those sets would be marked down , Yeltsin moved inside instead of out . <p> Gorbachev had always reminded Katya of her father , who was born in Russia but had moved to the States in the fifties . She had not yet bought him a Father 's Day present , yet here it was , already the November after . She might have forgotten entirely about Father 's Day , if not for her obsession with the boy and his turkey baster father . <p> The boy , named Anther , had visited Katya in the morning of the day when she left for vacation . He had asked to play with the smallest Matryeshka in her collection . <p> She gave him the set of five nesting dolls . <p> " Wish I had my own one of these , " he said , several times . <p> Katya , hearing the hint in his question , raised her voice , " Is that so , " she said , annoyed . She really needed to pack , and did not want to pay him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had yet to grow into his adult ears and teeth , wore his dark hair short in front , with a rat 's tail braided down the middle of his back . " We learned about Russia in school , " he said . <p> The wooden dolls snuggled in his lap as he took them apart . The largest , about ten inches tall , was painted with a red peasant dress and a yellow and red flowered shawl . Inside that  --  a doll wearing painted purple and green . He worked the dolls apart quite gently until he found the baby , swathed in a painted yellow wrapper and no bigger than his little finger . With the baby nestled in his palm , Anther rocked his hand back and forth . <p> Katya heard a knock at the door : Anther 's mother , Noni , who poked her head inside . " Hello , " she called to Katya . To Anther she said , " It 's time to go home . " Noni wore her black hair spiked high , a section shaved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Stature of Liberty . " <p> Katya tried to help put away the dolls , but Anther shook his head and pushed her hand away . " No , " he said , quite deliberately . " I 'll do it myself . " <p> So Katya invited Noni inside . Noni sat on the couch beside her sons Katya took the wooden rocker . Noni 's confession began innocently enough . " Those are very nice , " Noni said about the Matryeshkas . <p> " They remind me of my father . He was born in Russia . " <p> " That 's one thing about a turkey baster , " Noni said with a quick glance toward Anther . " They do n't remind you of anything , except maybe Thanksgiving . " She laughed . " Course the good thing is , you do n't need to remember your baster on Father 's Day . " <p> " What do you mean  --  turkey baster ? " <p> " I like to joke it was medical grade , " Noni said , and laughed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped me mix their semen in a plastic bag . We sucked the semen into a turkey baster and my partner inseminated me . That 's how I got Anther . " <p> Katya stared at Anther , preoccupied as he worried the outer top-half of the doll into its counterpart . " Does n't he wonder who his father is ? " she asked . <p> " What 's to wonder ? " Noni said . " Anyway , we think of him as the donor , not the father . " <p> Then Anther asked , " Think I could watch your fish while you 're gone ? " Katya 's stomach twisted . She understood what it meant to practically grow up without a father . <p> " Feed him once a day , but not very much , " she said . <p> " Oh I will . If you want , I could even change his water , " Anther said . <p> The trip to Death Valley had been a bust . She had not met anyone interesting , and the thought that maybe men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her awake several nights . Katya told herself now that she was right to have let the boy care for her fish . Anther would have been scarred for life had Vlad starved to death in her absence . <p> " We 've had a lot of interest in those dolls , " called out the woman from behind the gift shop counter . " Especially after Gorby bit the dust . Collector 's item , you know . " <p> " Really ? " Katya asked , torn between wanting to keep the dolls or give them to her father . He had left Russia as a young man , abandoning his elderly mother to come to America . <p> Katya often wondered if there might be other relatives still living . Her father was quite secretive , and if there were relatives , he had never mentioned them . Katya did n't even know his real last name ; he had been given another at Ellis Island . She had not seen him much since her parents divorced when she was only ten . Then five years ago her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older than Katya . <p> She looked at her Gorbachev doll and stared into the painted eyes , the dimpled cheeks , the balding hair pattern shaped like a U from the back . The painted birthmark lay in exactly the same place on his forehead as the place where she remembered her father had a brown mole . She suddenly realized that Gorby was the spitting image of her father . The two men were related , as sure as there were little green apples and children conceived with kitchen tools . Uncle Gorby . <p> She paid for the doll and held the package cradled in the crook of her elbow . Then she heard a voice over the concourse loudspeaker , telling her to pick up a white courtesy phone . She found a phone on the rental-car counter near the baggage claim . <p> " Hello , " Katya said , and gave her name . <p> " Your stepmother has been trying to reach you , " said the operator . " She knew that your flight came in today . We asked that she call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . " <p> " Sounds just like her , " Katya said . <p> The operator spoke softly , and the noisy terminal made her voice sound as if it were wrapped in tissue paper . <p> Katya held the receiver close to her ear . " Speak up please ! " Katya shouted . " I ca n't hear what you 're saying . " <p> " I have very bad news , " said the operator . " I 'm really sorry to be the one to tell you this . " <p> " What is it ? " asked Katya . People rushed past her to stand before the baggage claim . The carousel began to turn . Katya tapped her fingertips on the receiver . " I have to hurry , my luggage is coming . Please , speak up ! " <p> And then the shouting , bare as a present given in a cardboard box . " Your father is dead , " the operator said . " Dead , " she shouted . " Do you hear me now . ' " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She looked across the expanse of blue carpeting , and knew it was untrue . There , sure as sky , was her father . He turned his face away , but she clearly recognized his wide shoulders , his tan suede coat , the " U " at the back of his head . He had n't aged a day since the last time she had seen him , two Christmases ago . " He 's right there ! " Katya cried as she hung up the phone . <p> She ran forward and thrust her arms to part the row of people standing before her . Two lanky pre-teen boys blocked her view . <p> " Excuse me , " she said in her most pleasant tone of voice . When neither one moved , she shoved her arms between their two T-shirts , now hunched together over one match . <p> " Guy , " said one of the pre-teens , who managed to squeeze more than one syllable from the word . " Have a cow , why do n't you ? " <p> Her father had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missing as well . The luggage was the only good thing to have come from her relationship with her boss , the ex-lover who had given her Vlad . He had won Vlad at the county fair on their only public date , the same night when he promised to leave his wife of twenty years . He had not kept his promise and had , in the end , abandoned Katya for a younger lover , a new hire in personnel . <p> Her clothes , her half-finished mystery , her birder 's field guide , her camera bag with ten rolls of exposed film she 'd been meaning to develop - everything gone . She watched the empty carousel complete its cycle , then begin again . The area cleared , and Katya stood staring at the carpet , swimming alone in a deep blue nylon sea . <p> She hated airports , filled with people leaving without saying goodbye to one another . She traced the Matryeshka 's outline through the paper sack , her fingers lingering on the crease where the parts fit together . At least now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Katya looked around her living room , somehow different than one week ago . Anther had piled her mail on the coffee table beside Vlad 's bowl . Vlad picked up his pace and swam the circumference of the bowl , greeting her with the goldfish equivalent of tail-wagging . She looked through his glass to watch the red blink of the answering machine 's reflection in the water . She sucked in her breath , then exhaled slowly as she sat on her couch and reached to press the button and listen to her calls . <p> The Singles Warm Line called to ask how she had enjoyed birding with their group . Could she come to a potluck in one week ? Her secretary called to let her know the office was running smoothly . The next call was from her stepmother telling Katya what she already knew . <p> " Honey , " her stepmother said , " I have very bad news . Call me when you get in , " followed by another call that said , " Sweetheart , I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And the last call : " The funeral is today . You 've never been there when he 's needed you . " <p> Her father dead ? On top of that , the lost luggage , and now the horrible realization that the last thing she had to remember her father by were these calls from his widow . Katya played the messages back , then flipped off the machine to prevent the tape from being accidentally erased . <p> " Did you miss me ? " she said to Vlad without emotion . She had not missed him . She unscrewed the fish flakes cap , but accidentally spilled in half the container . " Eat up , " she said , beginning to feel hungry herself . <p> Katya unwrapped Gorbachev and set him on the coffee table . She heard a child 's voice and looked out her living-room window , where she saw Anther , home from school . Soon she heard the familiar clatter as he set his bike on her stoop , then knocked on her door . <p> She hurried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here , " he said , thrusting a handful of snapdragons he had picked from the flowerpot on her stoop . <p> " Thank you , " she said . " Would you like to come in for some ice cream ? " <p> Anther walked inside . He was very clean , except for a little mud on the bottoms of his sneakers . She thought of asking him to remove his shoes , but clean carpeting no longer seemed to matter . <p> A question burned within her : " Do n't you ever wonder about your father ? " Instead , Katya asked , " Chocolate , or vanilla ? " <p> " Vanilla , " he said . His toothy grin made Katya feel guilty ; she knew that Noni did not believe in feeding the boy sugar . Anther pointed to her new Matryeshka , and Katya nodded , meaning he could play with it . She walked into the kitchen and dished out ice cream topped with marshmallow sauce . She brought the bowls back to the living room . Anther sat in her rocking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one minute , " she said . She dialed her father 's number and let the phone ring until her stepmother answered on the tenth ring . <p> " So , " Katya said . " What happened ? " <p> " I suppose you heard by now your father died , " her stepmother said . " Funeral was yesterday . Had a houseful of mourners , then . Not much to do about it now . If you lived close by you could take home some of this food before it goes to waste . I wish there was some way to ship it to you . " <p> " I 'm sorry , " Katya said . " Do you want me to come ? " <p> " Well , it 's a little late for that , do n't you think ? " <p> Katya stared at her ice cream . " Did he say anything . . . about me ? " <p> " Now Katya , do n't start this again . I did n't make a transcript , you know . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die ? " <p> " Dropped dead of a heart attack , " her stepmother said . " Ate himself to death . " <p> Katya said good-bye . <p> " Are n't you going to eat your ice cream ? " Anther said . <p> " No , " she answered , and handed her bowl to him . She noticed Vlad had stopped swimming and lay belly up , his red eyes gone white . " Vlad is dead , " she said , as if noting it for an official record . <p> Anther brought the spoon to his mouth . " That 's too bad . " <p> Katya took Vlad 's bowl away to empty into the toilet . She flushed and watched him swirl in the tank , before spiraling downward into fish hell . <p> " Where 's Vlad now ? " asked Anther when she returned . <p> " He went for a little swim , " she said . <p> " Oh , " he said . " Maybe we should drive to the pet store and get another fish . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " Finish your ice cream first . " <p> Katya joined a support group for people who had sighted their relatives after death . in all there were twenty : five members . Their leader , a woman named Sunny , made her living as a clairvoyant who performed past-life regressions . She explained to Katya the five stages after death . <p> " Denial comes first , " Sunny said . " Where you do n't really believe someone is dead because the hospital would n't let you in to view the body , so you suspect they made a mistake . " <p> It turned out that this had happened to one young man , who swore that the nurse had pronounced his mother dead . He found out hours later , when the doctor made his visit , that the nurse had been wrong . The shock of it all was what ended up killing his mother . <p> " The second stage , " Sunny said , " is anger . Where you find yourself furious every time you see someone older or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It is n't fair , " said the plump woman sitting beside Katya . " Why did my in-laws get to eat French Brie and live ? And my poor husband , dead at only fifty-eight . " <p> Bargaining , Sunny said , was probably the most embarrassing one to admit . " You plead with God to take your cheap uncle instead of your father , because your cheap uncle never bothered to send you a birthday gift , even though you 'd sent presents to him and his wife , and their three children - now grown  --  for twenty years . " <p> There was depression , the stage the support group told Katya they thought she was stuck in . Food was one cure for depression , or shopping , or time , or anti-depressant drugs . <p> " Do n't worry about putting on weight , " the woman who had lost her husband said . " It 's better than taking up smoking . " <p> " I 'm not sure I agree with that , " said the man whose mother had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shirt pocket . " Smoking 's not so bad , " he said with a look toward the plump woman , " compared to other things . " <p> Last of the five stages was acceptance , but there were no guarantees one could get to that one , despite having gone through all the others . <p> " But this did n't happen when my mother died , " Katya said . " Why did n't I see her ghost ? " <p> " Maybe she had nothing left to say to you , " Sunny said . <p> After the meeting , Katya drove home and ate a bowl of ice cream while she listened to her stepmother 's voice . <p> " Honey . I have very bad news . Call me when you get in . " Katya listened to the tape , and after , could not get to sleep . <p> She saw her father 's ghost the next day , when she took Anther to the " It's-A-Dollar " store in the mall . She found It's-A-Dollar a great place to shop whenever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't have much cash . <p> She gave Anther a five and kept thirty dollars to spend on herself . That was enough to buy twenty-nine items , which the salesclerk packed into the large pink plastic tub Katya had picked to hold her purchases . Anther chose four plastic hockey sticks and a blue flowered tissue holder for his mom . <p> She led him toward the exit . They debated over whether to stop and buy a half-pound of bridge mix or spend the money on an Orange Julius , Anther 's choice . Then she saw her father standing in front of Hickory Farms with his back to her , barely two hundred feet away . Her father had once told her how much he liked their beef-stick , which reminded him of the salami his family had cured back home in Russia . She remembered little of that conversation . " If I 'd had a son , " he had said , or something like it , " I 'd have taught him the butcher trade . " <p> " Hurry , " Katya said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the tan coat , toward the ' U ' of hair . She waited her turn behind shoppers clogging up space at the sampling counter . When she finally stood at the front , her father had vanished . <p> " You forgot to get a fish , " Anther said as she led him toward the parking lot . <p> Anther spent Friday night . He and Katya had changed into their two-piece pajamas and were playing their third game of crazy eights when Katya asked , " Do you ever think about what your father was like ? " <p> Anther laid his cards face-down on the coffee table and reached toward the plate of brownies they had baked right after dinner . ' I do n't have a father , " he said . <p> He stuffed a whole brownie into his mouth and the crumbs dribbled down his shirt and onto her carpeting . As Katya watched the boy eat , she felt something gnaw at her stomach . <p> " Everyone has a father , " she said , her voice tight and high . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He grabbed at the plate . <p> " But I do , " Katya said . " I do have a father . I 've seen him , " she said . <p> Anther shrugged . " I believe you , " he said . " Can I have some milk , please ? " <p> " Yes , " she said . " I 'll get it . " <p> She walked into the kitchen and looked at an old picture of her father which she had taped to the refrigerator . Katya touched the glossy paper and felt a chill course through her . She felt so very alone , almost as if she were an incomplete being , like a Matryeshka whose halves did not fit together . <p> She opened the refrigerator to pour Anther 's milk With the door open , the light 's reflection formed a halo over her father 's head . A lightness started in her chest , then floated downward toward her belly . It occurred to Katya that she ought to write to Uncle Gorby , ask if he remembered a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer talked about . She wondered if her uncle had children of his own . <p> She brought out Anther 's milk . " Excuse me for a minute , " she said , then dialed her fathers number . <p> " Hello , " her stepmother said . <p> " Hi , " Katya answered . " Could I ask you something ? Where exactly in Russia did my father say he was born ? " <p> " I do n't know , honey . He never talked about that . " <p> " But I heard him talk about Kiev once , " Katya persisted . " When I forgot your wedding . Father said something like , ' If I had a son , he could learn a trade just like my father taught me back in Kiev . ' " <p> " No , " her stepmother said . " It was n't quite like that , as I recall it , and I remember the day quite clearly . It was my wedding , you know . " <p> " Well , what exactly did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hesitated . " Now do you really want to go over this again ? " she said . " Honestly . I warned him he was being too harsh . " <p> " Tell me , " Katya said . <p> " Now honey . I hate dragging this out again . He said , " she began , " that he wished he had never had a daughter . " <p> " Oh , " Katya said . " I guess that 's right . Maybe you mentioned that once before . " <p> " Water under the bridge , " said her stepmother . <p> " Was he still angry with me when he died ? " <p> " Of course he was angry . But you know deep down inside he really loved you . " <p> " Yes , " Katya said . But she did n't know , not really . <p> She had Anther brush his teeth and she laid out his sleeping bag atop the sofa cushions . He clambered inside , smiling up at her as she smoothed down the pillow and turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , his voice tentative and small . She resisted an urge to lean over him and smother his forehead with tender kisses . <p> " Good night , " she said , and walked to her room . She sat at her desk to begin her first letter to Uncle Gorby . Would n't that be something ? she thought . Would n't Daddy be pleased if I found his brother ? She put her pen to the paper , but her hand shook from cold , and she found it difficult to write . <p> " Dear Uncle Gorby , " she began at last . " It might come as a big surprise to learn you have family in the States . Perhaps you could come visit . There 's something I want to talk to you about . " She shivered and tucked the hem of her pajama top into the waistband to ward away the chill . <p> And then a voice floated above her , clear and real . " I am all right , my daughter , " her father reassured her in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Is that you ? " Katya looked around her room , but saw nothing , except maybe the flicker of the floor lamp . She felt close to tears as she hunched over her desk , hugging herself . <p> The lamp crackled and the light sputtered off . Katya closed her eyes to the darkness of the room . <p> " Daughter , " said her father . " Why are you doing this ? I am gone and you can not bring me back . " <p> " How could you leave without telling me goodbye ? " she whispered . " How will I know if you forgive me ? " <p> " I will , if you forgive me , " he whispered , and at once the cold lifted . She felt her father 's countenance , noticed the slightly sour aroma of leather , the prickling feeling on her cheek like a kiss . She warmed inside an unconditional embrace as her father took her hand and led her toward her bed to sleep . <p> There was a weak knock on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked , " Are there any brownies left ? " <p> She opened her eyes and sat up quickly in bed . " I 'll make you breakfast , " she said . " Oatmeal , with bran added . Fresh fruit , whole wheat toast . " <p> She heard him groan . " What time is my mom coming to get me ? " he asked . <p> " Later , " she said . " Are n't you hungry for something healthy ? How about waffles ? With real maple syrup ? " <p> " Great , " he said . " Health food , just like at home . " <p> She followed him into the kitchen . He plopped into a chair and she walked past him to the cupboard . She heard a crunch and lifted up her foot to look . Anther had been playing with her Uncle Gorby doll and Gorby 's head had rolled off the table and onto the floor . <p> She cried out , a high-pitched moan . <p> " It was an accident , " Anther said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face was cracked down the middle , and the back of the head had broken off . Anther handed her the pieces . " I was going to put it away . " <p> She clutched Gorby 's head ; her breath quickening . " What have you done. ? " Katya screamed . " You little bastard ! " <p> The boy looked up at her and his lips quivered in slow motion . His eyelids welled with tears , and he pulled up his shoulders as his body convulsed . <p> She cradled Gorby in her palm , tracing the cracks with her fingertips . Her dad , her lover , her luggage , her goldfish , Uncle Gorby  --  all gone . And now she was about to lose Anther . <p> She set the broken Matryeshka doll on the table and placed her arm across the boy 's back . " I 'm so sorry , " Katya said , but he did not calm at her voice . " I did n't mean it . Please do n't cry . " She patted Anther 's back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a shudder , then returned to normal . <p> " It 's okay , sweetie , " she whispered . " I can glue the head like new , and then you can have the doll to keep . " <p> He looked up at her , and smiled , halfheartedly . " Really ? " he asked . " Do you promise ? " <p> " Yes , " Katya said . " I want you to have it . " <p> His eyelashes were shiny . He hugged her tight around the waist and she felt his warm tears seep through her pajamas . " Wait till I tell my mom , " he said . <p> " Your mom , " Katya answered , having almost forgotten that he had one . <p> " You 're my very best friend , " he said . <p> She smoothed down his hair . " Your best friend , " she said , disappointed . Yet even that was better than nothing . <p> " Did I ever tell you that I always wanted my own set of Matryeshka @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Katya answered . " You 've told me that before . " <p> He pulled away and moved to open the refrigerator door . " So , what do you want to do today ? " Anther asked as he rummaged inside . <p> " I want to go shopping " Katya said . " I need to buy something . " <p> " Like what ? " Anther asked . <p> " I do n't know . Maybe something for the singles potluck . I just need to shop . It does n't really matter what I buy . " <p> " I understand , " Anther said . " My morn does that , too . But we could buy a fish . You do need another fish . " <p> " Yes , " Katya said . " You 're right . That 's exactly what I need . " She brightened . She would find a smarter fish , maybe something tropical and pretty . <p> She squeezed past him to the counter , where she heated up the waffle iron and started the batter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen as she cooked the waffles to a light oak color . Katya gave Anther a small plate with one waffle , a tablespoon of syrup drizzled over the top . She kept the other waffle plain for herself . <p> " Can I have seconds ? " Anther asked , before he had finished eating . <p> Then he helped her with the dishes , and after , ran ahead into the living room to straighten up . <p> She left him alone to change . " Get ready , " she said . " I 'll be there in a minute . " She dressed and joined him at the front door . On her way out , she turned around , feeling as if she had forgotten something . <p> She walked back to the coffee table and cleared away enough room for a small aquarium . <p> " Katya ? " he called from the stoop . <p> " Just a second , " she said , and looked outside the front window . The day was clear and sunny . She took a step toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her answering machine .
