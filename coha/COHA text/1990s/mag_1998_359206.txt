First , there 's the flag . It snaps bravely enough in the breeze blowing in off the sea . But there 's something just slightly off about the image . Old Glory looks , well , old in this backlighted image  --  thin , faded , antique , like the unambiguous emotions it used to stir in an age less given to irony and selfishness than our own . Steven Spielberg , in his new film , Saving Private Ryan , wants us to think about that , about how " the deep pride we once felt in our flag " has given way " to cynicism about our colors . " <P> Then there 's the memory of those distant days , now preserved by faltering old men . One such , accompanied by his anxious wife and middle-aged children , shuffles up the shady walk edging the military cemetery that stands where the guns once looked down on Omaha Beach , where American troops began the bloody business of liberating Europe in World War II . He makes his way through ranks of crosses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of David . Finding the grave he seeks , he falls to his knees sobbing , overwhelmed by that flood of memories it is Spielberg 's business to reimagine , then to incise on the minds of a generation dismayingly heedless of history . <P> Now comes the chaos that challenges patriotic fervor as well as the mind 's capacity to comprehend horror  --  the D-day landing on Omaha : seasick soldiers slaughtered the minute the ramps on their landing boats are lowered ; other men clambering over the sides trying to avoid the fire , only to drown under the weight of their packs ; the surf turning red with the blood of the slaughtered ; some who make it to the narrow beach huddling immobilized yet pathetically vulnerable behind what little cover they can find . A few inch forward , hoping perhaps that being a moving target is safer than being a stationary one . <P> It makes no difference . Whether you live or die here is entirely a matter of chance , not survival tactics . Spielberg 's handheld cameras thrust us into this maelstrom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mosaic of terror . We see as the soldiers see , from belly level , in flashes and fragments , none more vivid than the shot , rendered almost casually , of a soldier staggering along , carrying his severed arm  --  the struggle against mortality encapsulated in what amounts to a sidelong glance . <P> It is quite possibly the greatest combat sequence ever made , in part because it is so fanatically detailed , in part because the action is so compressed  --  all that panic in such a tight spot  --  in part because the horror is so long sustained , for more than 20 relentless minutes . " I wanted the audience in the arena , not sitting off to one side , " says Spielberg . " I did n't want to make something it was easy to look away from . "
