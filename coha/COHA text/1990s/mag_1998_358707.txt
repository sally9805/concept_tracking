It was supposed to be a routine visit to Dad 's place in Framingham , Mass. , back in 1979 . But the weekend visitation for two daughters of divorce ended up lasting 18 1/2 years when Dad told the girls , then 5 and 2 , that Mom had died in a car crash and they were moving to Florida to begin a new life . And that they did . Sources say Dad had a knack for charming wealthy women , and he lived a life of luxury in Palm Beach , where he called himself William Martin and variously passed himself off as a doctor , a Harvard-educated lawyer and a government agent . It worked just fine in the tony resort , where nobody gets too nosy about anyone else 's millions . In fact , nobody asked much about any aspect of Martin 's past . Not until April 16 , when police came knocking . <P> Martin 's real name is Stephen Fagan , and on the day of his arrest on the abduction warrant , his daughters , now 23 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First , Dad had a new name and was behind bars , charged with kidnapping them . And second , their mother was alive . <P> " They had no idea " about their past , says Lynn Rooney , the Middlesex County , Mass. , assistant D.A . who broke the news to the young women . " It was difficult for them , and it was difficult for me , " Rooney said . <P> Fagan was arraigned in Cambridge the same day the girls ' mother , Barbara Kurth , held a press conference to make an emotional plea for a reunion with her daughters . " Not a day has gone by that I have not thought about whether they were safe and happy , " said Kurth , who is remarried and has no other children . Police began their investigation last September when an anonymous tipster reported Fagan 's whereabouts . Kurth has been a raw nerve ever since . " My only desire has been to know how my daughters were doing and whether a reunion might take place between us . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father . Kurth condemned Fagan for living an " incredible charade . " At the time of the divorce , he had accused her of being an alcoholic and an unfit mother ( her lawyer denies both charges ) . She accused him of involvement in unspecified fraud , and she got custody . <P> Sources say Fagan 's next wife was a widow who received a large settlement after her husband was hit by a car . Chris Larmoyeux , a Palm Beach lawyer , said Fagan was a devoted father , a well-liked neighbor , a director of the Palm Beach Opera company and a generous man with his money . " When you look at how he 's raised his daughters and how they turned out , he 's done an extraordinary job , " Larmoyeux says . <P> As parental-abduction cases go , this is a wild one . But it ultimately has something in common with most others . In the end , there are no winners . <P>  --  By Steve Lopez              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
