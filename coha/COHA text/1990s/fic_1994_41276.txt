My days with Cecilia are crowded with the props of the slim British novels my wife devours . Half-eaten slices of cold toast , semi-warm tea with the pale milk scud lying discouragingly on top ; that sort of thing . I often parade around in ratty underwear , and when Cecilia sleeps I can most often be found combing the police log of already read metropolitan newspapers for the details of grisly murders . It goes without saying I am perpetually behind things . I enjoy a strange identification with the spinster librarians in those books of my wife 's , those perpetually hopeful overage girls who live in a fog out of which they can not quite see to the fact of the balding pediatrician 's less-than-honest intentions . But in most ways we are not alike . My life , as I prefer to view it , is full of facts , closely looked at . <p> I 'd like to say , for instance , that Cecilia is bright , or exceptionally precocious . The fact is , I would n't know how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see any . Occasionally we pass them in the park , but though Cecilia 's head always perks up in these instances , as though she 'd like nothing better than to rub noses with another ten-month-old , I do n't think I could bear to get involved in one of those conversations I overhear between parents on park benches . They have nothing whatsoever in common outside of the base facts of parenthood , so what gets talked about is Justin 's progress with the walker , Julie 's teething habits and extraordinary verbal felicity , and the problems poor Mrs. L  --  is having with her son , who at sixteen months has yet to take his first step . Let 's not fool ourselves  --  beneath this seemingly casual comparison of achievement lies the most savage competition , a clawing for the superiority of one 's own over another barely masked . To hell with Justin and Julie , I say ; Cecilia and I push on . <p> She is a happy child ; I think I can say that without too crippling a sense of doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an end table with one hand and lift herself so that she 's standing almost unsupported ( can you do that , Justin and Julie ! ) , and , in recognition of the feat , crow with delight . At such moments , I am superfluous . I am the man on the couch in his underwear , trying not to catch furtive glimpses of himself in whatever mirror happens to be lurking nearby . I am her caretaker ; I clock the hours between waking and sleeping , with time out for naps . My wife does n't come home until after she 's asleep most days ; I know why , and I do n't care to comment . There is a ruddy and obnoxious economist she 's taken up with , a fellow member of her department at the university . A mutual friend informed me , expecting I 'd do something about it , but I have n't , and suspect I wo n't . <p> By trade I am a shop teacher , part-time . My employer is a very expensive private middle school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hill on land donated by one of those families  --  you know the ones I mean  --  whose name conjures an aura of sacrosanct white privilege but whom I can not imagine without the accompanying vision of pristine white body parts squatting atop porcelain chamber pots . Perhaps this image is a result of the fact that Cecilia shits so much , but I like to believe that my mind is not so cause-and-effect . The red buildings of the grounds are ancient brick and smell of the exertions of generations . The place is athletic as all hell and justifiably proud of its many trophies . In a room that might have served the lathers of the eighteenth century , I train the boys to shave a block of wood straight , smooth , and square . For the satisfactory performance of this job , I am required only two afternoons a week . Shop is not a high priority at the Russell Academy . <p> That I happen to be doing this job : well , we 're all old enough not to require explanations anymore , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own shop teacher from twenty years past was Mr. Talanian , an Armenian rumored to have thrown a hammer from twenty feet at a wisecracking boy . Like my classmates of those days , I saw little beyond the truism that shop teachers are brutes . Either that or something less . So my boys  --  my Barneses and Neuwirths and Hulls  --  view me , I 'm sure , in an opaque light . I am dim and incomprehensible in my soiled blue shop coat . The lights are caged and ancient , of a piece with Russell . Once a boy nearly took a finger off learning to use the electric saw . I saved him in the nick of time and watched how , five minutes later , laughing , he had managed to forget both the saved finger and my quick heroism  --  a necessary part of the job , as I see it  --  and would most likely soon be back to making fun of me behind my back . No matter . <p> On Tuesdays and Thursdays , when I am at work , Cecilia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour for the service . It is a decent arrangement , and loose enough so that , after the last of the boys have left the shop for the day , I am free to linger , in the shop or on the grounds , enjoying the fading light and the last moments of relaxed freedom before going to pick up Cecilia . It is at such moments , as the low light slides in under the blinds onto the clean shop table or as I stand at the edge of the playing fields , that I allow myself my one moment of fantastic longing : for a friend like those friends one encounters in films , a short , thick-bellied , wide-faced man with a name like Colin or George , either married or in constant woman trouble , but not bothered much by either state of affairs , a fellow shop or perhaps mathematics teacher , who , at the end of the day , is always available and eager for a hop down to the pub ( in my imagination there is one at the foot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chat about football scores , all the while engaging in our true business , which is what I will call a muscular and disciplined appreciation of the qualities of light and silence . <p> Such a moment  --  altogether male , as I see it , but I 'm willing to be convinced otherwise  --  is the one thing lacking in my days . No such friend exists . Colin is an invention of the film writers . We are all busy , and have to plan even the briefest , least satisfactory of encounters weeks in advance . There is no pub at the foot of the hill . The long playing fields stretch out these days in shades of ocher and sienna , but as I stand at the edge of them I am only too keenly aware that Mrs. Leaver has been expecting me for fifteen minutes already , and Cecilia ca n't be ignored much longer . <p> So I hop in the car and drive the quarter mile to the two-family house where Mrs. Leaver lives with her two children in what I perceive to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is always laughing as she clears away the line of tricycles and children 's toys that block her path to the door . There is no Mr. Leaver , apparently ; at some indeterminate time in the past , he headed for the hills . On the faces of the two Leaver children , a boy and a girl , barely school age , I detect the droop-jawed neediness of the abandoned . They are angry children , given to kicking walls on what seem to be the slightest of pretexts . <p> Mrs. Leaver notices none of this , of course , and screams at them to stop kicking , meanwhile turning back to me with a broad smile to share a joke or to ask after my adventures in the Russell shop . Cecilia clings to me as soon as she is handed over , and I feel a certain guilt at splitting my attention in order to afford some to Mr. Leaver , who seems to relish a bit of adult companionship at this point in the day . Certain looks and gestures have led me to believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a pass , if only for the opportunity of shrugging it off or both of us raising our eyes to heaven as if to say , " If only it were n't for these children , what larks ! " In fact , what I am thinking at such moments is that it is only the children who are keeping us from the unbearable chaos of a shag in the half-abandoned Leaver bed . I see the two of us groping and kicking there , and I want to grab Cecilia and dash for the safety of the house . <p> There are only the two of us in the station wagon on the ride home , myself behind the wheel , Cecilia in the plastic car seat , and it does seem at those moments as though we are negotiating a kind of minefield , while Cecilia hums one of those secret harmonies which signify to me that , for her , the minefield is all contained in the dense foliage of Mrs. Leaver 's rooms and halls . <p> There was a woman before Mrs. Leaver . Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their mothers . That the world had seen fit to discard this truth constituted the basis of Mrs. O'Connor 's argument with the universe , and the argument had settled like a pall over the modest day-care business the woman conducted from her home . " Poor baby , " she would croon as soon as I handed Cecilia over to her , and I stood racked with guilt for the hours afterward , as I attempted to explain the principles of going with the grain to Barnes , Neuwirth , and Hull . " She barely ate , poor thing , " Mrs. O'Connor would tut when handing the baby over , and in that tut was contained something akin to the moral furor of the Nuremberg judges . <p> The cruel truth is that perhaps men do n't , after all , belong with babies . I 've thought this myself , wondered why , if the idea were such a good one , we seem to be the first people in history to have thought of it . And lest you come back with a counterargument too quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first people in history to have come up with aerosol cans and magazines with titles like Self . The rigors of advanced capitalism force us into odd and twisted postures , and this notion of men as nurturers may be just another one of them . I was recently in a diner in some nearby town , feeding Cecilia her favorite lunch of mashed bananas and Cheerios , when the local execs started trooping in . One man in particular was noticeable . He could not get a knife dean enough , kept sending them back . Then he started on the forks . There was a pronounced tic in the man 's facial gesture as he sent back utensil after utensil , a kind of astonished blinking . And as I mused on what horrors of unnatural activity had forced him into such neurotic behavior , I noticed myself mashing bananas and Cheerios together with a rhythm that might , from his table , have looked at least equally strange . The only reason I hesitate to carry this argument further is that I might find myself agreeing with Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> One night last week my wife came home at her usual time  --  nine o'clock  --  and headed straight for the bath , her usual practice . I generally have something simmering on the stove when she gets home  --  this particular night I had cooked pork chops in olive oil and rosemary , with a roast-pepper dressing  --  but I make sure it is something that will keep and not dry out during the ritual bath taking . I do n't want you to think she is one of those women  --  or ours one of those marriages  --  constructed of cold silences and an ironclad respect for the Unsaid , though on the surface that might be what it appears . I think of it as a peculiarly living thing , and for that reason do n't need to bother her as to the lateness of the hour or the lack of interest she displays in Cecilia 's welfare . By this time , Cecilia is snug in her bed , wrapped in a double diaper and a woolen yellow sleeper . In her bath , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her , the leavings of the economist Bruce Friedman . I could ask after him , and after a pause and a considering lift of the eyebrows I 'm sure my wife would tell me everything , or nearly everything , without tears or mortification . I like that aspect of things , and for that reason have never felt compelled to ask . I waited this night outside the bath until she 'd done what she had to do and then stepped in . <p> The bath is not quite full length ; it 's a bit cramped , if the truth be told , so a body lying full length looks somewhat less resplendent than it ought to . My wife 's breasts have long since returned to their pre-pregnancy shape ( she quit nursing at three weeks ) , but her middle retains a pleasing lumpen aspect , the last evidence of Cecilia 's nesting . She 's a good-looking woman whose body , unfortunately , leaves me cold . Has since the day she brought Cecilia home . Hence , Bruce . So we can leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I sat on the toilet and stared at her and waited for her to acknowledge me . She was soaping her breasts at the time . I was wearing a blue bathrobe that had seen better days . ( Get on with it ! you charge at this juncture . Fix yourself up , and perhaps your life 's problems will be solved ! I will try to ignore you . ) <p> " How did it go ? " I asked . <p> " Department meeting , " she answered , still not looking up . " The usual shit . " <p> " Did you eat lunch ? " I asked , in my mothering tone . <p> She told me what she 'd eaten , and then some departmental gossip . For her , there is still the illusion that these late evenings are caused by work . I helped dry her off , a process I enjoy , in large part because it reminds me of drying Cecilia . Then she ate the pork chops and drank the wine I 'd poured her , and the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michael Caine spy movie from the Sixties . It was of the genre where the filmmakers tried very hard to distinguish their man from James Bond , with thick glasses and such . I believe they called this , at the time , a Greater Realism . In other words , there was absolutely nothing unusual about this night except what happened midway through the spy picture . My bathrobe happened to be open , unintentionally , and at the moment when Michael Caine was about to be tortured my wife reached over and lifted my penis . It is quite a long one ( or so I 've been told ) , and as she held it there , limp but extended upward by her grasp , it bisected the image of Michael Caine 's grimacing face . She held it for he length of time it took for the torture to be completed and then put it back in place . A commercial came on , and we lay there in a kind of awed silence . As soon as the movie came back on I began reporting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infection , etc . My wife listened , quite patient and interested , but not as though this information being imparted was anything she was going to have to act on . In a short while , before the movie was finished , she fell asleep . I stayed up awhile . I checked on Cecilia . It was early spring but it had snowed during the night , and outside our windows I could see it falling . I was trying to connect things , and having a hard time of it . In my mind was the image of Bruce Friedman thrashing away between my wife 's thighs in a manner I imagined as resembling the behavior of a crazed member of the college crew team . Then there was the holding of my penis . In her little room at the top of the house my daughter slept , and outside was the snow , gentle and unthreatening and more a reminder that winter was over than that some new and tremendous difficulty lay ahead . I planned my lesson for the next day , and then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Cecilia was up early the next day , so I changed her and fed her a bottle . Then I sat her on her high chair and let her play with some teething things while I fixed my wife her eggs . It seemed to me , as I did these things , that something was noticeably different . I went through these rituals trying to put my finger on it and failing . Each time I tried to affix this difference to a specific prospect  --  would my penis finally stand ? would my wife stop seeing the economist Friedman ?  --  I found these things to be insignificant and unworthy of the larger pleasure I was experiencing . <p> I pondered all this while Cecilia gummed her Mr. Happy toy and the yellow eggs bubbled on the griddle . My wife was late for her first class and barely had time to gobble the eggs , kiss Cecilia , and dash out the door . I got no kiss . I had a cup of coffee and read the obituary of a man who had been influential in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Leaver 's and then went myself to the shop , arriving fifteen minutes before class , a decent interval , and began laying out materials for the day 's lesson in soldering . <p> It went fairly well . Hot metal is quite a pleasant thing to work with , but dangerous , and Barnes , Neuwirth , Hull , and the others never appear so vulnerable as when they first hold the hot soldering iron in their hands and begin moving the liquid metal around . There are moments in the day  --  this was one of them  --  when their faces , ravaged as they are by the crocus shoots of incipient puberty , seem to strip back to the point where they appear as babies again , naked and innocent as Cecilia , with powdered bums and fingers like the pincers of crabs . On certain afternoons when Cecilia naps and I fall asleep for a brief nap as well , I have experienced moments of awakening when , for the first three or four seconds , the facts of my existence seem to have escaped me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where I am , or what action is next required of me . It has occurred to me that such moments  --  that waiting for the facts to catch up  --  might constitute our firmest grasp of reality . I was thinking this , anyway , as I watched Barnes , Neuwirth , and Hull grapple with the mysteries of soldering . Soon they would be skilled enough to draw erotic figures in hot metal . I have seen them etch enormous phalluses and breasts in wood ; it seems to be their primary joy , once they have mastered a skill , to impress one another with the lewd purposes to which it can be put . But they were not yet at this point with soldering ; that is , the facts had n't caught up , and they stood at their places , holding their irons with a sort of wondering detachment . <p> When the class was over , I went into the teachers ' room and had a cup of coffee . I had n't been inside this room since my first day at Russell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the facilities , had insisted I step inside and " meet the staff . " Two women speaking French in a corner of the room had scared me off that day . By now you will have guessed that I am a sensitive type , but it 's no exaggeration to say that these two rare birds showed contempt for me . We caught them in the middle of a discussion . They were discussing Flaubert 's " Un Coeur Simple , " as I recall , and did not take to being interrupted . Oh , they were very civil , but when you 've been around academics as long as I have  --  especially low-grade academics , the not-yet-tenured , the private-school types  --  you begin to sort out the ones who are afraid of you . God knows where this fear comes from  --  perhaps it 's my very shagginess , the air I seem to give off , with my long hair and blue shop coat , of being a rough guy , that makes them fluff their feathers and nest more defensively over the egg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all but something else . Whatever , they gave off a skunkish stink that day , and I have kept away ever since . So you can imagine the degree of confidence  --  the extent of my good mood  --  as I sauntered into the teachers ' room that day and sought out the cup with my name on it that had been gathering dust on the shelf for nearly a year . <p> I was wearing my blue shop coat still  --  no shame there  --  and , well , if you must know , I was hoping to find Colin . It was not until I 'd poured the coffee and sat down to drink that I noticed there was only one other person in the room . A woman sat on the edge of a sofa puffing great blue streams into the air from a slender brown cigarette . She peered at me through this haze and said , after a moment , " You 're the shop teacher , are n't you ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> She stared out the window . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . <p> It was all she said . Her smoking was languid and highly studied , of a piece with the fold of her legs and the high severe neckline of her dress . I wondered what the proper response was : " Teaching soldering is likewise a bitch " ? Would that have started us off on a stimulating interdisciplinary chat ? I 'll never know , because I said nothing . Instead , I began thinking of Mrs. Leaver , who was , in any case , never far from my mind during these stolen minutes after the close of shop . What would Mrs. Leaver have made of such a comment , among her toys and the persistent smell of urine ? At the moment , I felt a silent communion with Mrs. Leaver , knew a desire to join up with her , put my hands into the muck of child rearing , to smell the soft wet smell and draw to my nose the small astonished body of Cecilia . There was nothing for me in this room , I understood , and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a hurry , he shouted , " Hello , Peg , " quickly poured himself a cup of coffee , and bolted it , standing stiff and upright before the urn , taking it black . He was a thin man , with suede patches on the elbows of his jacket and the sort of head that seems to make itself over after the age of forty , so that no trace of the youth he might once have enjoyed remained . After he noticed me , he stood staring for several seconds , rapidly blinking his eyes in the manner of a man trying to wake up quickly , with no time to enjoy the fuzzy-headedness of waking . <p> Finally , as if something had just then occurred to him , he half shouted , " Shop , is it ? " <p> I nodded , he checked his watch and ran for the door , and that was the end of that . <p> When I picked up Cecilia that day , I was more than usually solicitous of Mrs. Leaver . I asked if she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tea or a drink . She said she would n't mind , and of course it was bourbon , which I poured over ice and did n't take any for myself . Cecilia was more or less content in my arms as we watched Mrs. Leaver drink . <p> " Your wife teaches , does n't she ? " Mrs. Leaver asked . She already knew this and was just making conversation , but I answered that yes , she did , and yes , Cecilia was my responsibility , day in , day out . It must be difficult , she said , and I answered no , it really is n't . <p> " With your wife away all the time , I mean , " she said . <p> Well , here is the juncture where things become problematical , because though I find it difficult to talk to the Pegs and the coeurs simples of this world , there are fine distinctions in any life that they might be able to receive with less effort than Mrs. Leaver . You see , I had an answer for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give it . Was it difficult with my wife away all the time ? Well , no . The birth of children brings on a kind of winnowing , as I see it . We are brought to the edge of a cliff and asked to dive . It 's perfectly natural that some will prefer not to . In most cases , though , one of the partners will be willing and the other left to find some distraction somewhere . The roles get sorted quite satisfactorily , and the only problem comes when , at the end of the day , the two meet and try to proceed as though everything is perfectly rational . What can there possibly be to talk about over the stir-fried chicken when one has been diving off a cliff all day while the other has been operating a staple gun or conjugating French verbs ? That we try to communicate at all is where we run into trouble , and consequently it is all a story of abandonment and betrayal , a fact Mrs. Leaver would readily understand if I could find words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild love to her every night just to assure her that my day has been like hers . But I find I can not ; the act has become inessential . Would Mrs. Leaver comprehend any of this if I made the attempt to speak , or is it better to leave it alone , unspoken and therefore brought closer to its true weight in the world ? It occurred to me just then that Mrs. Leaver is my Colin , this ratty house of hers our leafy pub . And as I watched her down her bourbon , I thought : yes , all right , it 'll do . She 's my man , my silent compatriot . I wrapped up Cecilia and drove home . <p> My wife was there already , a surprise . Her little Volvo sat parked in the driveway like a note left there for me . Inside , she was cooking . It was clear right away she had come home to save her marriage . I imagined somewhere on campus the economist Friedman running hard laps to sweat off the effects of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with zucchini and prosciutto . Lovely . A recipe from the old days , before Cecilia , when my wife still liked to cook . <p> I kissed her and busied myself with feeding Cecilia . Already I could see I had done something wrong . My wife was pouting as she lay strips of prosciutto on a plate . That she was here , she believed , ought to have altered things more than was presently visible . What I wanted to tell her was that the rhythms of a baby 's day are eternal , and weather events more climactic than an errant wife 's return . As the lifeboats were lowered off the Titanic , I imagine all the mothers on board opening their little jars of Gerber 's ; six o'clock is six o'clock , iceberg or no iceberg . I fed Cecilia and felt my wife 's presence , and thought of the spurned economist under the shower , the hot gush of water parting his thin hair ( mine is marvelously long and thick ) , sloping over his beard like lather . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and there was a soldering gun in my hand , which I used to part his pale humbled cheeks ... well , enough of that . I had n't known I was this jealous , and I 'm not sure even now whether it was n't an effect of the imbalance caused by my wife 's sudden appearance . I could smell the butter and cream now . Some sensual promise seemed to hang on the air , but what I ought to do , what action to take , eluded me completely . <p> During dinner , I was , as usual , solicitous of Cecilia . It 's what she 's grown used to , after all , my presence at dinner , humming and murmuring shy endearments . These annoy my wife , which is one of the reasons her returning late has never bothered me . She kept refilling my wineglass like an underappreciated husband eager for his wife 's attention , and I kept resisting these pleas , turning to Cecilia and making up reasons to fuss . To tell the truth , I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places where the lines of one 's behavior go underground . If you were to ask me even now why I was resisting my wife , I could offer you any number of explanations , but none of them , I am sure , would be even close to the truth . As far as I could tell , the problem was fairly simple : we wanted different things . <p> What I wanted was to watch the video I had picked up on the way home from Mrs. Leaver 's . The Train , with Burt Lancaster . I had looked forward to getting Cecilia to bed and popping the video into the recorder , then lying back and listening to the terse , witless , but perfectly functional dialogue characteristic of the classier Sixties films . I would lie there , feeling splendid , wholly absorbed in the action , and my wife would join me after her bath , yawn once or twice and ask me to fill her in on the plot , then fall asleep before the final shootout . I 'd cover her and fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruitless but oddly satisfying , are the dark heart of any smoothly running domestic existence . The point is to beat slowly . The point is to remain unexcited , to run at a steady pace . This was the wisdom I had attained after years of trial and error . And here was my wife with the dinner and the wine , and I knew I might as well forget The Train . <p> When I brought this up , she gave me one of those looks : yet another one of your dreary movies , which you watch only to avoid having to deal with me . She was quite certain she could see right through me , and I knew it would serve no purpose to point out that what she was seeing was only the mirror of herself : what such behavior , if she were doing it , would certainly mean . We live in an age and time , I suppose , when it is virtually impossible to admit without shame that one might prefer the derring-do of Burt Lancaster to the white thighs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for bed , I began to dread the scene that awaited me . The snow of the night before  --  that subtle indicator of change endured  --  now seemed not so benevolent to me , and the lifting of my penis  --  an act I had regarded as a mutual recognition and appreciation of irony  --  struck me as something quite different . <p> She was sitting at the kitchen counter when I came downstairs , and the dishes , my one remaining distraction , had all been stacked in the dishwasher . It remained only for me to add the lemon-scented powder and turn the thing on . Before her was a glass of red wine  --  a Spanish vintage , highly recommended by our local wine merchant  --  and the image of her struck me right away as a pose of mourning . It was then that it occurred to me she had come home not to save her marriage but to end it . <p> I have no idea what my body was doing as it took in this possibility , but I do know that my mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signified to me the onset of panic . Suddenly a flood of images shot upward , most of them having to do with my old friends abandonment and betrayal , until one attained dominance : a vision of the economist Friedman , not as I had most recently imagined him , a diminished creature under a hot punishing shower , but hale , hearty , and well fed at his own dinner table , enjoying a final meal with his wife and two sons , harboring his secret and thinking , as he sopped up the last of the chicken in his wife 's good garlic sauce , of the suitcase he would soon pack and the parking lot of the strip shopping center where he and my wife had no doubt planned , after the twin leave-takings , to meet . Off they would ride into the April evening , most likely to an off-campus motel notorious for its between-classes assignations , to spend a mildly sobering but nonetheless fulfilling evening of committed sex before rising to teach their morning classes . <p> My great desire at this point was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much the facts I was resistant to as the melodrama that seemed about to unfold .

It seemed to me altogether better that I should pop into the next room while she composed a note outlining her intentions and estimated day and time of departure . I prefer the thing written , that 's all , and ambiguity thereby skirted . If my wife , for instance , is about to say the words " I 'm leaving , " what will she really be saying ? " Fight for me " ? " Do n't let me go " ? There 's no true way of knowing , you see , and in order to find out , I 'd have to humiliate myself in one of those endless groveling scenes I detest .

Before the glass had been placed back in front of her , I announced that I had left the garden hose unraveled in the side yard and used that as an excuse to get outside . <p> Ours is a small yard , located to the side of the house , with just enough room for a few garden beds and a set of lawn chairs . On summer nights it is pleasant to sit outside and listen to the crickets , looking up at the large house with that peculiar sense of pride new homeowners enjoy . The house is our solidity , the house and Cecilia asleep within it ; all else is a transience too horrendous to contemplate .

Oh , dear ! The forsythias are running amok ! " until someone like Burt Lancaster comes along to lay her and push her life into a more robust phase . It often occurs to me that what we 've become is a whole nation of Deborahs fussing in the garden , waiting for Burt . Who knows what form Burt will take when he comes ? Global cataclysm ? Religious redemption ? It 's none of my business , really ; I 'll be either very old or gone , and it 's Cecilia who 'll live to find out .

How sad to think of a man standing up on the moon , standing in the middle of a life like mine , staring across the vastness of space at another planet , one assumed empty . Then the image disappeared as I recalled that we had been there , we had confirmed the emptiness . We are now quite certain that no one lives on the moon . <p> There was a sound from within the house . I turned to see my wife , through the window , washing her wineglass in the sink . Evidently , she 'd given up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was off the hook . The monster had submerged , that was all . Meanwhile , my mind , as if obeying some perverse will of its own , had fallen into a kind of reverie , superimposing the image of Mrs. Leaver on the woman at the sink . Immediately , I saw it was no good . I am not fool enough to believe that you can put one thing where another belongs and escape that way . My wife was drying her hands . She put her rings  --  removed for the dish washing  --  back on , looked out the window once  --  I knew she would n't see me in the darkness  --  and headed upstairs . <p> I went and sat on one of the lawn chairs . They are sturdy chairs , a craftsman 's chairs , though we bought them cheaply enough , unfinished , sanded and painted them ourselves . This , again , in the days before Cecilia . We were quite the couple then , quite the doers-of-things-together , and , gathering this information , you will no doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our romance . That would be the conventional view ; it is , I am sure , my wife 's view . But as I sat there in the cold chair pondering the end of things , it was not the death of romance that was on my mind ; rather , it was the curious happiness I had achieved with Cecilia , a happiness I now saw threatened . For some of us , the presence of a woman is not enough to convince us we 're not alone . Only a child can do that . And once it happens , all other relations change . There is nothing cruel or deliberate about this ; it is simply what happens , simply what is . <p> I looked at the house then and knew what it was I had to do . It is at such moments that I always wish I smoked cigars , even cigarettes , or drank strong whiskey . There is something pleasing , manly even , in reaching a decision but retaining the presence of mind to finish the smoke or drink in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the balance of things . But I have none of these vices ; there was nothing for me to do , really , but to get up from the chair . Our bedroom window faces the back of the house ; from where I was sitting in the side yard , all I could see was the blank wall housing our bedroom , the sloping roof , and the eaves . It was up to me to imagine the scene within , without even the helpful scrim of a lit curtain . My wife , who ten minutes ago had left the kitchen , must by then have removed her dress and slipped into a nightgown . There was the ritual of the face cleaning , then the teeth . But I needed only get up . I needed only enter the house . It did n't matter where I found her , really . It would all be the same . <p> There were first , though , the things a careful husband does before turning in : checking the burners on the gas stove and the pilot lights , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and making sure the lights are out . Then upstairs , quiet against the carpet . My wife was already in bed , asleep , a surprise . <p> In the bathroom , I undressed . I am either vain or only normally vain , depending on your view of such matters ; I give vanity no thought at all , but I do usually take a look at myself naked before turning in . Just as the pilot lights are checked to make sure they 're still burning , so the tummy bulge is monitored , and the puffiness around the shoulders and breasts that may be the seat of highest vulnerability in the male ; as much as some of us may act or seem to want to act like women , we fear turning into them . We do not want breasts ; at least , I do not . I do n't generally pay much attention to my genitals , but tonight I studied them , gazed upon them like a pile of old schoolbooks I 'd just come upon and knew a desire to flip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schoolbooks . One held on to them for nostalgic purposes , and it occurred to me as I regarded them how deeply nostalgia rules our lives after a point , nearly every act a beckoning after an earlier , somehow purer act . What I was about to do was merely a recognition of this truth . Nature sees fit to leave us with our genitals even after they have served their function , so we are more or less compelled , for good or ill , to arrange life around their use . This is as far as we have come . Perhaps , it occurred to me as I caught the last ghostly image of myself in the fading of the switched-off light , it is as far as we are capable of going . At least , until Burt comes . Whatever Burt turns out to be . <p> In bed , I immediately lowered myself to my wife 's center . Another nostalgic act , and one I harbored little doubt about . Sex is not difficult even in the worst of times . Certain scents carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the days when I engaged in this sort of thing regularly , it always seemed to me that , in entering my wife , what I was in fact doing was sitting down in a darkened movie theater and letting the images roll past me , as if it is in sex , not death , that all the important events flash before one 's eyes . I do n't know if my wife was surprised enough to object when I began to penetrate her ; her hands grasped my shoulders , in shock or pleasure I 'll never know . The lights were out . She quickly achieved the high moaning that , for me , contained her former presence as acutely as the handwriting on her earliest letters . The difficulty , if there was one , is that studying her early jottings , or her picture in the high school yearbook , pleasant as these things might be , is not the same thing as appreciating her presence now . So lovemaking had this air for me of a secondary activity , a scratching after the past , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too painful an alternative . Yet in this way , and only in this way , I knew I would win her back . She would accept the shadow for the act ; the false activity was for her , as for most others , the real . No one is really interested in evolution , or not many . Already , I could feel the onset of the great thwacking orgasm I could always summon from her , loud and deep , a thrumming bass note . And then , always , predictably , her hands would cradle my buttocks , so as to hurry me on , that I might join her in these depths of pleasure , and as I made the first sounds of my own approaching orgasm , her breath became deep and solemn , as if there were something terribly serious about a man letting loose a jet of sperm . All of this happened as it had happened in the months and years before , as if we were a pair of old troupers fallen on hard times who had agreed to repeat one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to any spectator like a pair of ghostly figures on the bed . Or perhaps anyone watching would have thought the scene only right and just : two fine bodies at work , in tune with each other . It was perfect sex , really , the kind we all aspire to . And I am just smart enough to admit that about all the important matters I may be dead wrong . Perhaps this was precisely what we ought to have been doing , and no more . <p> Afterward , my wife cradled close to me , affectionately . I trust there is not an excess of vanity in the fact that , for me , at that moment , there was no question as to the defeat of the economist Friedman . I was aware of him fading , of the light closing around us and on this image of domestic restoration . Not for nothing do we respond as we do to the fifth acts of Shakespeare 's romances . No one , even in this unlikely age , is fond of divorce . The notion persists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to believe this is so for us . I waited until she was asleep and then went into Cecilia 's room . <p> There is not a lot there . We are neither of us much for the sorts of painted-ceilinged wonderlands you see in the movies when the filmmakers want very badly to let you know how devoted the young parents are . Most babies live in rooms like prisons and gaze out at the world through the bars of a crib . None of this is accidental . Life , in fact , is extraordinarily blank : rooms have walls and floors , that 's all , Cecilia , and this is where we live , here , between these walls and floors , in these rooms , and with luck , we can keep them blank , keep away the terrible scenes and fights that require us , in reaction , to pin up pleasant scenes and vistas that are all of a piece with falseness . None of this , of course , will I ever tell her . Instead , I will pat her small tender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only in silence will I offer the enormous thanks that is due her . This little room is my chalice , my cathedral ; of course , I 'm not telling you anything new in admitting to this . I will do what I can to preserve it . I will do what I must to retain my happiness . <p> Anthony Giardina is the author of two novels , Men With Debts and A Boy 's Pretensions .
