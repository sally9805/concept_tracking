<p> Street gang members have infiltrated the ranks of the Chicago police force , a Sun-Times investigation shows , and the city 's top cop says the department is largely helpless to weed them out . <p> In the last three years , at least 15 cops have been charged with crimes , forced to resign from the force or are under investigation for illegal activities linked to their street gang affiliation . Involved were some of Chicago 's most notorious street gangs , including the Gangster Disciples , the Latin Kings and the Latin Lovers . <p> " We ca n't deny we have individuals who are members , fraternize or associate with street gangs , " said Police Superintendent Matt Rodriguez . <p> " Why would they not do the same things organized crime always did , such as infiltrate the police ? " Rodriguez said . " If the Mob bought judges , politicians , and policemen , why do we think the gangs ca n't do it ? " <p> The Sun-Times findings include : <p> Police officials are investigating reports of a scuffle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year after two cops flashed opposing gang signals . <p> One Calumet District officer arrested for selling drugs said that as a Gangster Disciple he developed a taste for the good life , including luxury cars and expensive clothes . <p> Two Shakespeare District cops linked to the Latin Lovers were questioned in connection with the theft of drugs from a dealer and the gangland-style killing of another dealer . One pleaded guilty to insurance fraud linked to the drug theft and resigned ; the other is under suspension awaiting dismissal . <p> Two other Shakespeare District police officers believed to have links to the Latin Kings were suspended pending Internal Affairs Division investigations into narcotics trafficking . <p> Two Northwest Side officers  --  both female  --  are under investigation for close links to known Northwest Side street gang leaders . <p> Rodriguez has been recently pushing cops to call a " Corruption Hotline " to report police gang members or signs of corruption . <p> " It 's growing as a problem , " Rodriguez said . " We 've had more officers arrested in recent memory whom we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " They come in and learn our investigative techniques , can spot undercover cops , know how we do things , " said Deputy Superintendent Michael W. Hoke , who heads Internal Affairs . " Yes , we 're concerned about that . " <p> But union rules and constitutional protections of freedom of association make it difficult to get rid of gang-affiliated cops unless they are caught committing a crime , Rodriguez said . <p> Some cops ' gang links are blatant . <p> An example is South Chicago district officer Delwin Bolton , 34 , who was called to Internal Affairs in 1994 after allegations were made that he used his police car to stop and rob a narcotics dealer transporting drug money . " When we called him in to question him , he showed up wearing Gangster Disciple colors , " said former IAD Cmdr. Raymond Risley , now commander of the Organized Crime Division . <p> Calumet District Patrol Officer Reginald Lee , 34 , enjoyed driving around the South Side in his Mercedes Benz 500SE . That stopped after Lee was arrested in 1994 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undercover detectives . Lee  --  given to expensive clothing and high living  --  explained to investigators that as a Gangster Disciple he had developed a taste for the good life . <p> " He immediately told us he was a Gangster 's Disciple , had always been a Disciple and would continue to be one , " Hoke said . " But he refused to talk about the Disciples ' drug operations . " <p> Lee is now in prison . <p> None of the former or current officers who have been investigated for gang ties , or their attorneys , could be reached for comment . <p> The stories of gang-member cops are well-circulated within the department . Two years ago , one Police Academy instructor went so far as to warn cadets about gang influence in the Northwest Side Shakespeare District . <p> " In the 14th ( Shakespeare ) , Cobras are on one side of roll call and ( Latin ) Kings are on the other side , " the instructor told the cadets , according to several officers present . Rodriguez said the instructor was out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In September , Chicago Police Officer Sonia Irwin , 41 , was arrested Aug. 30 , and accused of taking part in a Gangster Disciple drug conspiracy . She resigned Sept. 16 . <p> " A lot of the evidence turned up against the gang was the result of our two-year investigation into her gang activities , " Hoke , the IAD head , said . Off-duty officer Wanda Wilson , 31 , and her husband , Jeffrey Wilson , were involved in a South Side shootout . According to reports , the couple thought the IAD agent following her was a Colombian narcotics dealer planning to ambush and kill them . When they spotted him , they stopped their cars and began shooting . " The husband has admitted being a street gang member , " Hoke said . <p> Two South Chicago District officers arrested for stealing drugs and money from Indiana dealers produced false warrants to gain access to Gary drug houses . Both were suspected of having gang ties and are now in prison . " I 'm willing to bet there are probably some others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " The problem is bad and getting worse , " said a 30-year veteran from a downtown District . <p> How bad ? Larry Ligas , a Logan Square activist said some narcotics officers do not like to work with Shakespeare District officers for security reasons . <p> " One narcotics detective told me she 'd rather go in the West Side because she knows their officers are straight , while she does not know which officers are gang related and which are not in the Shakespeare District , " Ligas said . <p> An undercover agent for the Drug Enforcement Administration said his agency sometimes runs into problems that may involve the relationship between the police and local street gangs . <p> " We get ready to pull off the raid and they ( gang members ) know we 're coming , " he said . <p> Rodriguez said : " I want them to know I am their enemy . " But he acknowledged that getting rid of gang-affiliated cops is n't easy . Constitutional protections of freedom of association and a 1992 arbitration of the labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible to dismiss a police officer for having a relationship with gang members . <p> " It 's easy to blame the union , " said Harold Kunz , Fraternal Order of Police trustee . The department can keep out bad cops through good background checks , he said . <p> Candidates for the Chicago police force are subjected to thorough security background checks , according to the department . After being selected on the basis of the written test , candidates are photographed and fingerprinted . <p> They must fill out documents that include references , and they are screened for drugs . If they pass the test , the department subjects the candidates to a background check for criminal history with local , state and federal authorities . Neighbors , references and friends are interviewed . Their driving records are checked , and court records are referred to for financial and personal information . Former employers are contacted . <p> Kunz said the union would defend the right of officers to associate with whom they pleased as long as it did not involve a criminal conspiracy . <p> Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has no record , even if we are able to show he fraternizes with someone without a record but who is in a street gang , legally I 'm limited . Associating with a questionable character is a thing we have lost as a reason for dismissal . <p> " What can we charge him with ? I need sanctions .
