Section : fitness vacations This one-week adventure holiday pays off in pounds , inches and other rewards <p> THE KNOCK ON THE DOOR SIGNALS it 's time to get up . It 's Dawn she 's the fitness director ) making her predawn rounds . The clock reads 5:30 but , fresh off a flight from the East Coast , my body says it 's 8:30 ; jet lag never felt so good . Time for a flash shower , then on with the sweats . Downstairs the stretch class is beginning . For 45 minutes we gently twist and stretch amid yawns and groans . Daylight gradually streams through the trees , streaking across the room . <p> Breakfast beckons us to the dining room . I can hardly believe the size of it ! A huge bowl of perfectly cooked oatmeal topped with a piquant raisin and prune sauce and a crumbling of no-oil granola , with a few almond silvers . To my surprise , l easily devour every spoonful . <p> Not much time to spare . We gather our fanny packs , fill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a van . A 10-minute drive delivers us to our first hike of the day : a postcard-perfect redwood forest . <p> " What 's that sweet smell ? " Marcus , an East Coast urbanite , asks . <p> " Fresh air , " his friend quips . <p> We all chuckle , but indeed the air is delicious . WELCOME TO SKYLONDA <p> So begins Day One at Skylonda . Located about 20 miles south of San Francisco  --  on Skyline Boulevard not far from the little town LaHonda ( hence , the name )  --  this year-old fitness retreat attracts people as much for its promise of spiritual renewal as it does for its physical challenges . <p> Weight loss , though not emphasized in any of Skylonda 's literature , is practically inevitable given the design of the program . Key to the experience is hiking 10 miles every day on some of nature 's most scenic trails and feasting on California 's tastiest 10-percent-fat-calorie food this side of the Dean Ornish program . <p> Does it matter that I 've hiked only twice in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treadmill workout three times a week enough to prepare me for eight hours of fairly vigorous exercise six days in a row ? <p> Dixon Collins , president of Skylonda , assures me I 'll be fine . " Do n't worry . You 'll be surprised what you can do , " he says . <p> To establish fitness levels and monitor gains ( and losses ) throughout the week , check-in begins with a basic fitness assessment and measurements  --  taken first in pounds , then in inches . <p> No ounce of excess can hide as the tape measure encircles my calves , thighs , hips , belly , buttocks , waist , chest and upper arms . Calipers pinch here and there to determine my percent of body fat . Angles measure my hip flexibility . A heart-rate monitor strapped across my chest and blood-pressure cuff wrapped around my arm establish my cardiovascular fitness while I pedal a stationary bike . WOODS WORDS <p> Out on the trail , Dawn divides us into two groups according to our fitness levels ; each group has at least two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to lead and sweep . ( That 's trailspeak for bringing up the tail end . ) Our group takes the high road . We climb steeply through low-growing huckleberries under a canopy of redwoods . Then the trail levels out as it contours around a ridge . The path is narrow , but we talk back and forth , getting acquainted . <p> Bruce , a Miami businessman , joins me for a short time , then his long , experienced hiking legs pull him ahead . Stu , a San Franciscan , shares his favorite eateries with Hillary , a New Yorker , who will be staying overnight in San Francisco before flying home . Marcus suddenly erupts with a piercing mock call of a macaw . <p> Meanwhile , mile markers along the way announce that we 've gone two , three , four , five , six miles . I 'm amazed how quickly we 've covered ground . <p> Bushed , we return to the lodge , where a blender batch of blueberry smoothies  --  some kind of sweet electrolyte-replacement concoction  --  awaits us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are hustled along to the circuit-training class . THE ULTIMATE 30-MINUTE WORKOUT <p> I 've never seen equipment like this be-fore  --  kind of sleek , with no cumbersome weights strung along their spines . Dawn explains that each of these machines delivers resistance by way of a fluid-filled hydraulic cylinder . As you pump , the fluid in the cylinder is forced through an aperture . The resistance is simply a product of how rapidly and forcefully you pump . Dawn demonstrates : She slowly  --  and with one finger  --  lifts a lever arm . There 's almost no resistance . Then she jerks it hard and fast and the machine resists like a 10-pound weight . <p> Called Progressive Aerobic Circuit Exercise ( PACE ) , this offers the ultimate muscle aerobic workout . So they say . The nice thing is , you do n't have to stop to adjust the resistance ; depending on how fast you pump , it automatically adjusts to your effort . <p> Each of us hops on a machine and gives it a try . I like weight-training machines , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Arranged in a kind of circle alternating with aerobic platforms or steps , stationary bikes or stairclimbers , the machines are poised for a circuit-training session . The music begins and we all get pumping to the aerobic beat . After just 30 seconds , Dawn bellows " Change " and we move to the neighboring piece of equipment . We continue , changing stations every 30 seconds for 30 minutes . Raining sweat , everyone looks like they 're having fun . <p> Cool-down follows . Then we move outdoors to the green for a half hour of floor ( or rather turf ) exercises focusing on the abs . Ugh . I did n't know there were so many different ways to tone a tummy . IS IT LUNCH YET ? <p> Lucky us : We 've got a 15-minute break . I check the massage schedule posted by the front door . Lucky me : I have a massage next ; got ta skip aqua aerobics . I down a glass of water , grab a handful of carrot sticks and rush downstairs to the spa . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I surrender my muscles to him . This is the day 's sole hour of scheduled pampering , and I 'm relishing every second . Afterward , I feel somehow lighter . <p> Cuddled in a terry-cloth robe and slippers , I float up the stairs to the dining room . People are just beginning to gather for lunch . <p> Even if I had n't worked up such an appetite , I would not leave a single morsel of lunch on the plate . Ummm . Grilled chili-rubbed turkey breast and black-eyed peas served over an assortment of baby lettuce leaves with a tangy dressing . I 'm almost tempted to have seconds but instead I pluck another slice of crusty home-baked , whole-grain bread from the basket . With a cup of decaf in hand , I head out to the deck to read and relax a little before the next round of vigorous activities . <p> The pause passes too quickly . It 's back to the gym for another 30-minute PACE session , then floor exercises ( this time concentrating on the legs ) . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the 4 o'clock hike . Thankfully this trail is shorter than the one we hiked this morning , though it includes some hill climbing . <p> Four miles later , at the end of our trek , we stop to pay homage to Methuselah . Fourteen feet in diameter and 1,800 years old , this is one of the oldest living redwoods on the peninsula , trailmeister Todd tells us . Talk about longevity . FROM SILENCE TO SHARING <p> Six o'clock signals quiet hour at Skylonda . Time to meditate , nap , veg out , or do whatever we have the energy for  --  as long as we do it silently . Exhausted , I head to the sauna . <p> I do n't expect anyone to dress up for dinner . And no one does . Liberated from street clothes , makeup , jewelry , even blow-dried hair , we 've adopted ease and comfort as our new priorities . Clean sweats conveniently double as dinner attire . <p> And , once again , the food is unbelievable : It starts with grilled Japanese eggplant with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a banana ginger sauce . Amazing fare ! <p> After a glorious dessert of poached pears , we shuffle upstairs and gather around the huge stone fireplace in the great room . Neil , Skylonda 's mind/body specialist , sits on the raised hearth stroking a gnarled stick decorated like a miniature maypole with . multicolored streamers . <p> " This is our talking stick , " he explains . " It 's a symbol of sharing , much like a peace pipe . When people come to a retreat like Skylonda , they usually come for a reason . We 're going to ask you to share with us why you 've come and what you hope to leave with at the end of the week . " <p> With that , he lays the streamer-covered staff in the middle of the table and entreats each of us , as we feel the urge , to pick up the stick and speak . <p> No one speaks . Neil sits quietly , as if meditating . As the minutes pass , the silence becomes heavy with anticipation . Will anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? How long will we sit here ? <p> What seems like 30 minutes passes . Finally , Marcus takes the wand . " I am living with an illness that may very soon take my life , " he begins . <p> The silence envelopes him . <p> " The strange thing is , I 've never been happier because I 'm finally doing what I always wanted to do . In fact , that 's why I 'm here . Skylonda is on my ' to do ' list . I 've always wanted to hike in the redwoods . " <p> He lays the talking stick back on the table . There is a brief pause , as we all try to comprehend . We have all been touched . Somehow , I feel my perspective on my own life shift . Then one by one , without hesitation , each person passes the stick . HIKING THE INNER PATH <p> Midweek , the hike takes an introspective twist . At the head of the trail , we wait our turn . Then , one by one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a solitary hike . With no one to walk ( or talk ) with , we 're free to set our own pace and follow our own mental wanderings . <p> Except for a few instances  --  when a switchback trail reveals another hiker , for example  --  I feel peacefully alone . Of course , there is comfort in knowing that fellow hikers are just paces ahead and behind . And there 's no denying the security of having Todd flag every intersection or fork in the road so we wo n't veer off course . <p> I glide through a shady grove . Then , as I emerge into the sunlight , the dense vegetation gives way to a spectacular view across the canyon . A couple of hawks soar below . I take a deep breath , filling myself with the experience . <p> The narrow dirt trail follows the canyon rim for a while , then begins a gradual descent through thickets of wild rose and flowering scrub . My mind drifts in and out ; one moment I 'm intent on a salamander scurrying across my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over events of last week . Slowly , my thoughts evaporate and the landscape gently lulls me into a trance . <p> Moments  --  or perhaps miles  --  later , raindrops awaken my awareness . I look overhead and see a cloudless blue sky beyond a dense redwood canopy . The " raindrops , " I discover , are falling from the trees , their needled branches dripping with moisture . The trail becomes softer underfoot now and is fringed with forget-me-nots and redwood sorrel . Ferns cascade down the hillside . A tiny bird flits by , lilting the sweetest song . I notice the faint sound of rushing water and , through the mist , I see a stream . <p> Amazingly , while I was lost in my thoughts , the trail led me to this mystical rain forest . <p> I continue to follow the path down to the stream strewn with moss-covered boulders and across the wooden bridge . Then I begin my ascent up the other side . For a while the lush tropical environs prevail . But gradually , as I climb higher , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm really sweating now . <p> Of necessity , my breathing switches from automatic to manual . I inhale deeply then exhale vigorously through my mouth with a whoosh . The rhythm helps propel me forward . But it feels like the grade is getting steeper . <p> Our trail leader warned us that the last two miles of this hike are all uphill ( after 41/2 miles of level or gradually descending grade ) . I stop to catch my breath , but only for a couple of seconds ; then I push on uphill . My body and mind pull together to meet the challenge . I try taking longer strides and pumping my arms for propulsion . Walking backward  --  something I learned on the steep sidewalks of San Francisco  --  makes the going easier . But I quickly realize it 's too treacherous on this rugged terrain . <p> So I enlist every visualization technique Dawn taught us the day before . First I pretend that I have a tow rope in hand and go through the motions of pulling myself up the hill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my arms . The techniques seem to work for a bit . <p> As I approach a bend in the road I hallucinate that the end is just around the curve . It is n't ; the seemingly endless trail snakes its way ever upward . <p> Now my mind taunts me . " You 're not going to make it , " it whispers . I glance backward and remind myself how far I 've come . With optimism restored , I climb on . <p> Finally ( I can hardly believe it ! ) , the van is in view . Exhausted as I am , I feel strangely exhilarated . TRANSFORMATIONS <p> From Wednesday on , the week slips away , mile by mile , conversation by conversation , one wonderful meal after another . I 've gotten so accustomed to living in sweatsuits and terry-cloth robes , I ca n't imagine wearing street clothes again . But I will . Just as soon as the last tape measurements and group photos are taken . <p> Friday night is reserved for the talking stick . Nell asks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one mentions pounds dropped . Many speak of emotional baggage shed . The week had a positive , if not profound , effect on most everyone . There was lots of well-wishing for Marcus , who left early to catch a hot-air balloon across the Napa Valley , another check on his " to do " list . <p> Saturday morning , after a sunrise hike with an incredible panoramic view , we return to breakfast . Our final " grades " are in . And everyone 's pleased . I lost 4 pounds and 4 inches . My roommate Chris lost no weight but dropped I 1 inches . Two of the biggest " winners " lost 5.5 pounds and 9 inches and 4 pounds and 13.5 inches respectively . Of the 13 people who submitted to final measurements , the average weight lost was 3.38 pounds and 8.2 inches  --  almost 3 inches from the middle ( waist and abdomen ) alone ! Not bad for a week 's work . <p> For more information on Skylonda Fitness Retreat , phone ( 800 ) 8512222 .
