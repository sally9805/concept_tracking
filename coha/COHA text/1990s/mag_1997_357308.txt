Eddie Quinn turns to his wife Maureen and warns her against trying to figure him out . " You ca n't understand my obscurity , " he says , " unless you have infrared vision . " Actually , Eddie , the flailing loser played by Sean Penn in the new lower-depths romance She 's So Lovely , is as easy to read as the funny papers . He loves the mouthy Maureen ( Penn 's own wife Robin Wright Penn ) and will do anything to keep her or get her back . Penn , though , is a more challenging read : Studs Lonigan , say , rewritten by Brando 's tougher kid brother . <P> He is Hollywood 's most frighteningly talented pug  --  Oliver Stone calls Penn " the ultimate anti-all- American Boy "  --  yet he relishes the role of father . " Family , " he says , " makes me feel there 's a reason I 'm alive . " The perennial wild child also plays disciplinarian to his and Wright 's son and daughter . " Robin is there for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in during the war settlements . Then there 's no negotiations ; I 'm basically the atom bomb . " <P> Even before his 1985 marriage to Madonna ( they divorced in 1989 ) , Penn had a rep as a ferocious scrapper , a plague on all paparazzi , a reluctant and truculent interview subject . These days Penn , who turned 37 this week and who married Wright last year after a long , volatile , off-and-on relationship , replies thoughtfully to a reporter 's probes . What about Hollywood 's embrace of independent films ? " I do n't trust that any more than I trust a mother-in-law 's love . " Is he happy ? " I 'm not going to accuse myself of being happy ; just saying that would put me in a bad mood . But I am feeling productive . I 'm feeling my life , which I did n't always do , partly because I 'd be drunk a lot . Now there 's a lot of good things going on . " <P> One more twist . What Penn really wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and obstinately , with The Indian Runner and The Crossing Guard . But from friendship , and to help bankroll his directorial dreams , Penn has made half a dozen films in the past year or so . Friendship with the late writer-director John Cassavetes led to She 's So Lovely , directed by Cassavetes ' son Nick , for which Penn won the Best Actor award at the Cannes Film Festival . And because Penn once met Terrence Malick in a bar and told him , " Give me a dollar and point the way , " he is now acting in The Thin Red Line , Malick 's first film since the 1978 Days of Heaven . This fall Penn will topline in two other major movies , Stone 's U-Turn and David ( Seven ) Fincher 's The Game . The fellow who eyeballs the future and says , " I think rare will be the case where I 'll act , " is in danger of becoming an A-list movie star . <P> She 's So Lovely is the tale of two souls who are " mentally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They have one talent : they can love each other really good . " Eddie , a small-time punk , is away when the pregnant Maureen is assaulted by a neighbor . Driven nuts by the news of her beating , he shoots a paramedic and is hospitalized for 10 years . In the interim , Maureen has married Joey ( John Travolta ) , but that does n't matter to Eddie when he gets out . He just wants his honey back .
