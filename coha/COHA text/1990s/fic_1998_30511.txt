Chapter One from The Lawmansaloon without the full protection of the law ? " She expelled a sigh . " Helpless ? Believe me , Marshal , I can look after myself . " If he only knew , she thought , and was tempted to enlighten him , as to all she 'd survived in her life . All she 'd overcome . " I reckon if that were the case , " he said , showing no inclination to retreat , " you would n't have felt compelled to mention your concern about the safety of our female citizens . " The end of the alleyway was in sight ; the graveyard next to the Presbyterian church was just ahead , set apart from the scourge of commerce by a split-rail fence . Beyond the church was a spring-fed pond , and a big , sunbathed rock where Aislinn loved to sit , dreaming and dangling her feet in the water . Her patience was hard-won , but she managed to speak calmly , and with dignity . She turned and looked up into McQuillan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said firmly , and she knew her eyes were flashing . " Now , kindly let me go my way . There are those of us who work for a living , and our free time is precious . " He laughed , swept off his hat and struck himself in the chest with it , as if to stanch a bleeding wound . His hair was the palest gold and at once ruffled and sleek , though in need of trimming . It glinted in the sunshine , like stuff spun from a sorcerer 's spindle , while his eyes were so dark a blue as to seem almost purple . She 'd been serving him meals most every day for a year . Why had n't she noticed , in all that time , just how devastatingly , dangerously goodlooking he was ? " I can see I 'm going to have my work cut out for me , ma'am , " he said , " but I 'm determined to win your confidence . Yes , indeed , I am determined . " Aislinn turned , hoisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the cemetery fence . " Please do n't trouble yourself , " she said , perched astride the top rail . " Good day , Marshal . " Having so spoken , she made to jump down on the other side , caught her dress on a splinter or some such , and landed in the grass in an ungainly heap , her skirts over her head . Face aflame , heart pounding with humiliation , Aislinn scrambled to her feet , just as the lawman vaulted over the fence . He was making a downright heroic effort not to laugh , but she was in no position to appreciate the sacrifice . " Are you all right ? " he asked , touching her cheek with the backs of his fingers in a curiously gentle way . Aislinn busied herself , brushing off her skirts and smoothing her hair , which had begun to come loose from its careful braid . When she looked at him , her eyes were full of angry tears , and she would have choked if she 'd tried to speak . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genuinely worried . He shifted , so that they were very close , and she felt the heat and easy , restrained power of him . For one wonderful , dreadful moment , she thought he was going to kiss her . Then , in the next instant , he stepped back . " Guess it 's mostly your pride that 's smarting right now . " He put his hat on , and she saw a wicked humor in his eyes , though he had the decency not to grin . " I 'd best be getting back , I suppose . " Back to the saloon , Aislinn thought ungenerously , but at the same time she was feeling a tenderness toward this man that she could n't account for , even to herself . Maybe Eugenie was right , and Shay McQuillan really was a good man , through the worst of his grieving and ready to go on . " Did you love her ? " She had never planned to ask such a bold and impertinent question ; the words came out by themselves . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hooked into his gunbelt , eyes hidden in the shadow cast by his hat brim . " Yes , " he answered , seriously and without hesitation . " Very much . " Aislinn stood for a moment , taking a new measure of Shay McQuillan . She 'd been so certain , until he 'd spoken those few telling words , that she understood the workings of his mind and the substance of his spirit . While she watched him , he climbed over the fence and walked away , headed toward Main Street . When she reached the pond , she found it peaceful , dappled with sunlight and windblown leaves . As she climbed onto the favored rock and settled herself there , she saw a deer approach the water 's edge on the opposite side . After studying her intently , the animal lowered its graceful head to drink , sending delicate , silvery ripples fanning out over the surface . Aislinn slid to the stone 's edge and slipped her feet into the water , and the sensation was so delicious that she let her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unraveled her braid and combed her hair with her fingers , letting it tumble down past her shoulders to reach her waist . The moment might in fact have been perfect , had it not been for the disturbing , persistent awareness that by changing something in himself , Shay McQuillan had changed something in her as well .
