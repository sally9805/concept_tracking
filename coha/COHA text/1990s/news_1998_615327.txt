<p> It was a classic high school moment on a recent morning at Atlanta 's Booker T. Washington , where Popeyes Chicken &; Biscuits Chief Operating Officer James Boyd Jr . hailed careers in the fast-food industry as students doodled , whispered and occasionally paid attention . <p> Nonetheless , it was an important business meeting for Boyd , who 's tackling the daunting challenge faced by all of his colleagues in retail and fast food : finding enough workers to keep the shop running . <p> Boyd launched his career in food service by cleaning grease traps at Wendy 's . He 's hoping his success story sparks interest with a new generation of workers likely to be more interested in the endless possibilities of technology careers than flipping burgers . <p> That 's why Boyd and five other high-ranking Popeyes executives took time out from running their company to pitch fast-food careers to high school students . <p> " It 's difficult for the kids to relate to the long-term vision unless they see me and see what 's possible , " Boyd said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then where are we going to get our next base of leaders ? " <p> This time of the year is always tough for retailers as they attempt to double employment rosters in preparation for the holidays . But metro Atlanta 's booming development and low unemployment rate have made finding good employees a year-round problem . <p> Rampant turnover rates are pushing retailers to replace their entire part-time staff at least once a year . Sources say metro Atlanta 's tight labor market has created a revolving door of employees who are jumping from place to place to capitalize on escalating hourly wages . In some parts of metro Atlanta , for example , retailers are paying new hires up to $ 12 an hour . <p> Specialty retailers  --  stores such as Toys " R " Us , Circuit City or Pier 1 Imports  --  lose nearly 70 percent of assistant managers in a year , while the part-time sales staff turns over at a rate of 124 percent , according to the National Retail Federation , the world 's largest retail trade group . <p> Paradoxically , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatively flat , according to a not-yet-released 1998 salary survey by the NRF . At specialty stores in metro Atlanta , the lowest hiring rate for assistant managers jumped 6.9 percent in 1998 , but the average hourly rates for existing employees rose only 1.2 percent , to $ 9.53 , according to the survey . <p> On top of higher wages , cash bonuses are becoming more common  --  in many cases just for punching the clock . At company-owned McDonald 's restaurants , new employees are offered bonuses ranging up to $ 200 spread over 30-day intervals for staying on the job  --  including a $ 50 reward for showing up on the first day , said Pamela Larson , human resources manager for McDonald 's Atlanta region . <p> And QuikTrip gas stations and convenience stores in metro Atlanta give part-time employees $ 250 for staying one year and $ 500 after two years . The employment crunch is so harrowing the National Restaurant Association and the American Hotel &; Motel Association have rallied sponsorship from Atlanta companies AFC Enterprises ( parent of Popeyes , Churchs Chicken and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that teach students how to work in these industries and then put them to work with internships . Boyd of Popeyes was speaking to Washington High School students as part of that effort . Now in 17 states , the Hospitality Business Alliance wants to roll out the program nationwide to 5,000 schools . <p> " The restaurant industry came to us and said , ' We have a crisis , ' " said Alliance spokeswoman Ellen Nash . " This is truly the most significant recruitment task that the industry has ever done . " <p> In addition to increasing competition for workers , cultural and economic shifts are drying up the pipeline of labor in retail and food service industries , which have always depended on young adults and homemakers who want to work part time . The baby boomer generation is hitting midlife , and young adults under the age of 30  --  the bulk of the retail work force  --  are in short supply . And while more women continue to enter the work force , they are opting for higher-paying , higher-skilled jobs than those available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are tapping the burgeoning Hispanic community as a solution to the employment crunch . Frank Phalen , who owns seven McDonald 's restaurants in Roswell and Alpharetta , said he was fortunate four years ago when Lourdes Guirola , a Hispanic woman fluent in English , joined his crew at one of the Roswell restaurants on Holcomb Bridge Road . Guirola eventually became store manager and began hiring other Hispanics and teaching them English during off-duty hours . <p> The informal program was so successful Guirola teaches a full class of English students from Phalen 's other stores . The staff at her Roswell restaurant is now mostly Hispanic , Phalen added . <p> " It 's a struggle every day to find good help , " Phalen said . " I do n't know what we would do if we did n't have her . " <p> While retailers and fast-food operators are begging for workers , they 're also starting to realize weeding out potential problem applicants pays off in the long run . Popeyes , for example , has cut its turnover rate in half among crew and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management candidates , said Lee Channell , vice president of people services and development for AFC . <p> As a result , AFC loses only 12 percent of its management in a year . The annual percentage turnover for crew employees is in the " low 100s " but still far less than the food service industry average of 250 percent for hourly workers , Channell said . The expense of such turnover adds up quickly . AFC estimates it wastes $ 800 in ill-spent time and training for each hourly employee who quits after a few months on the job . <p> Some retail employment experts say the constant push for warm bodies is hurting the consumer as well . " There are people working in customer service today who should n't be and would n't have been even five years ago , " said Bill Lins , director of operations for the employment firm Personalized Management Associates in Marietta . " Some retailers are lowering their hiring standards just to keep the store open . " <p> Consequently , sources say , stores are moving toward self-service setups like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumer has been conditioned to react to price , " said John Mason , president of Management Recruiters International in Atlanta . " They do n't really expect service now , they just want value and to get checked out quickly . " <p> The staffing dilemma does n't seem to be putting the brakes on retail growth , though . <p> With market share penetration the most pressing retail issue , it 's not so much a question of if retailers will find help but how . <p> " Atlanta 's at the high end of employment problems , but it 's viewed by the big national retailers as a very important market , " said Greg Rubin , retail consulting partner of Arthur Andersen . " They 're not going to back off , because if you can be successful in Atlanta , you can be successful anywhere in the South .
