The Moon Over Crete <p> " It 's hard nowadays being a girl . " <p> Lily looked up , surprised , and saw Mrs. Zinn 's luminous eyes gazing gently at her . She wanted to ask , " How did you know ? " but she found she already had the answer : Mrs. Zinn simply knew . <p> " Was it easier anytime ? Was it easier when you were a girl ? Lily put her flute down and sat in an old armchair covered in a faded fabric . She did n't feel like practicing today . <p> " When I was a girl it was hard , too , " Mr. Zinn peered at the ceiling from the piano stools where she sat , lost in thought . " I was younger age in the 1940s . At the time was legal to deny a woman a job simply because she was married . I do n't know how many talented doctors or musicians we lost because women were home scrubbing floors . Do you know that in many states women could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zinn glared at Lily with outrage . <p> " I was smart in school , " Mrs. Zinn continued . " That was n't valued in a girl , especially since I did n't hide my pleasure at beating the boys in the spelling bees and other contests we head . And on top of that ... " Mrs. Zinn paused . " I saw things . I did n't really know what was happening , only that I saw events just as clearly as if I were there , when I was n't present at all . <p> " At the time one of my brothers was in the army , fighting in Europe . One day in the middle of dinner I stood up and screamed - they say the whole block her me - but I had seen something horrifying ! My brother running , holding his gun , then suddenly the ground shook and he burst into flames . I babbled this to may parents . They were so angry with me for talking about my brother in that way ! I was sent to my room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill had been killed by a bomb . " <p> Mrs. Zinn took out a hanky and wiped the corners of her eyes . " I was so shook up by that vision that afterwards I tried to ignore the things I saw . I did n't talk about them to anyone . If I 'd trusted myself more . I probably could 've helped my family and friends avoid bad decisions and accidents . " Mrs. Zinn 's voice lowered almost to a whisper . " I count that as my biggest failure - not trying to help people with my gift of sight . " <p> Mrs. Zinn sat staring at the piano keys . Lily and softly . " But maybe people would n't have believed you if you tried to give them advice . " <p> " You 're right , they probably would n't have , especially since I was just a young girl . But I know of a time when girls did stop disasters , because they had my gift , and important people listened to them . It was a time when women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little more important . " <p> " When was that ? " Lily tucked her legs under her and riveted her eyes on Mrs. Zinn 's face . Lily was eager to hear the story , but also knew it would mean no etudes on the flute today . <p> " About 3,500 years ago , there lived a girl named Phyra on an island named Crete . " Lily noticed Mrs. Zinn was holding what looked like a green coin in one hand as she spoke . It was been carved prettily all over . <p> " Phyra lived with her mother , grandmother , father , sisters and brothers , aunts and uncles , cousins - " Mrs. Zinn stopped . " You think the house must have been crowded , do n't you ? Well , it was n't , because they had many little houses connected with porches and passageways . Phyra had a wonderful childhood playing in the meadows in the town with other children and the birds , chipmunks insects , and flowers . Phyra in those arts . Back then children followed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work the way we do own . There were no schools then . " Mrs. Zinn paused to sip her tea slowly " You like that idea , do n't you ? " She smiled . " Phyra learned what she wanted from whichever adults could teach her , and from observing people and nature . There were n't any books at that time , either . <p> " But what Phyra enjoyed most was going to the palace with her family on every full moon to hear the prophesies of the Queen-priests . The Queen-priestess wore a full , layered , colorful skirt which she had dyed and sewn herself . She lived in the palace with her husband and children and many other priestesses and priests . Phyra loved to hear her sing the prophecies , and she loved the rate occasions when the Queen came to her family 's house for dinner . Then they all played games and Queen told stories for the children just before bedtime . Phyra though she wanted to be a palace priestess someday . " <p> Mrs. Zinn glanced at Lily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Things certainly were different then . What happened next ? Did Phyra become a priestess ? " <p> " Her family tried to discourage her . But Phyra felt so strongly it was her calling to be a priestess that finally , her family agreed . <p> " After Phyra got her period and was old enough to train as a priestess , she went to the palace to live . Her parents were a little nervous , because the training was difficult . Many young women and men quit , and were discouraged and depressed . Phyra spent long hours changing , mediating , and doing rituals of one kind and other , in order to awaken her psychic powers , if she had them . She felt calm and happy during this time . <p> " One day she saw a vision that the town would experience a powerful earthquake , more powerful than the occurred in many decades . Other priestesses also had similar visions , and they told the Queen , who recommended elaborate rituals , including the sacrificing of animals , to appease the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jealous since we 've been living so well for so many years , ' explained the Queen . <p> " The rituals , sacrifices , and worrying went on . The day before the earthquake was to occur , Phyra had another vision . She saw a pretty blue bird in a meadow . It said . I am the sky . Come out and play with me , and I will save you . ' Phyra against told her vision to the Queen , who decided sacrifices and prayers were in order for the sky-sprites as well , so they would help the townspeople . <p> " But Phyra disagreed . We should do exactly as the bird says - leave our homes and go play under the sky . ' Perhaps Phyra felt this way because it had been months since she 'd played freely in the meadow . She 'd been so busy with her work inside the palace she 'd almost forgotten about the simple joy she felt watching the ants at work , or looking for the sweet red berries that hid under fuzzy , prickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment . Phyra 's suggestion seemed a little uncivilized to her . But she remembered stories she 'd heard from her grandmother - how long ago the people of the town prayed simply by going outside and looking , seeing , smelling and touching the plants and living creatures . The Queen also remembered an old saying : Let youths lead elders on new paths . ' <p> " So the townspeople did just as Phyra recommended . They went outside to wait for the earthquake , which arrived just as predicted . Children and many adults were crying and praying with fright . People held onto tall weeds or clutched at grasses as the ground shook under them . After several minutes it was over , and no one was hurt since they were out in the open where nothing could fall on them . Some food and pottery was lost , but the people had so much they could afford to lose a little . " <p> Mrs. Zinn sank back in her chair . Lily was still leaning forward , her eyes fixed on Mrs. Zinn 's face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she asked insistently . <p> Mrs. Zinn 's eyes looked deep and sad . The big hand on the mantle clock creaked forward . Finally Mrs. Zinn said . <p> " Some years after that earthquake . Crete experienced a massive flood and invasions by people who were not as peaceful or willing to share as the Cretans were . I do n't know what happened to Phyra , but I do know that Cretan society was never the same again . Warriors took over the palace , keeping the best food and treasures for themselves . The palaces was abandoned . Cretan families were torn apart , and boys trained to be soldiers , the girls to be maids for the conquerors . " <p> " How did you know about Phyra ? " asked Lily . " Is it written down ? " <p> " Few historical records have come down to us from that time , " Mrs. Zinn 's eyes seemed to be glowing , penetrating the walls of the house . " I know because I 've been there . " <p> She put the green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table . It seemed almost to float above the table for a few minutes , shimmering in a light both faint and illuminating . But when Lily reached out to pick it up , it became just a small stone disk in her hands . It felt very warm . <p> Lilly looked at Mrs. Zinn . Telling the story about Phyra seemed to have tried her out , and she looked almost like a child about to fall asleep . After a few minutes Lily asked softly . " How did you get to where Phyra was ? " <p> Mrs. Zinn opened her eyes and sat up straight . She looked hard at Lily for one full minute . Lily looked back boldly , right into her eyes . <p> " Yes I think I can tell you , " said Mrs. Zinn finally , almost to herself . she plumped up the pillow she was leaning against and slipped it behind her again , placing her hands neatly in her lap . " I traveled to the past . There are many ways to travel in time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must suspend you belief in time . You must not think of events as happening in the past or future . You must not even think of them as happening in the present ! " <p> " When do they happen , then ? " <p> " When is not a world you can use without time , is it ? Some people say years , months , days , and seconds , are all in the mind of a Universal Being - what Phyra called the Goddess . Others say the years are like a string of beads - you thread the beads one at a time , but they 're all there before you make the necklace , and they 're still there after it breaks . The events that take place in those years , however - that depends on what we decide to do . " <p> Lily nodded solemnly , trying not to look too confused . She rubbed the green disk absent-mindedly . Mrs. Zinn took it from her and held it up . <p> " This seal is from Crete . I got it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that place and time . Once I 've managed to suspend my belief in time ( no easy task , let me tell you ) , I hold an object from where I want to go and ask it to take me there . The technique itself is quite simple . You do n't need any fancy computers or machines , like they show in the movies . " <p> Lily 's heart was racing with excitement . If it was that simple , she wanted to travel in time too ! " Can you teach me how ? " she asked breathlessly , her eyes sparkling . <p> Mrs. Zinn looked at her and laughed . " You 're almost jumping out of your skin ! " she exclaimed . " I might be able to teach you , but only if you have the talent . Even them I 'm not sure it would work . I 've never tried to teach time-travel to anyone before . " <p> " Oh , please try now ! " pleaded Lily . " I promise I 'll practice every day - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Mrs. Zinn smiled . " Well , first you should be sure you like timetravel . Would you like to go on a trip with me soon ? " Lily shouted happily . " Yes , yes , YES ! ! When do we leave ? Do I have to pack my toothbrush ? " <p> " What you bring depends on where and to what time we go where you like to go ? It 's just as easy - or hard - to go back to the beginning of time as it is to go back to yesterday - if we have an object from that time period , that is . " <p> " What 's the earliest time you have an object for ? " <p> " Well ... " Mrs. Zinn put her finger to her lips in thought . " I 've never really concentrated on gathering objects for time travel . I think I have a little fossil of a trilobite . " She opened a drawer of a little wooden side table . Lily saw a tangle of rubber bands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zinn rummaged around and produced dime-seized piece of gray stone that looked like cross something like that an put it in a jar to watch . <p> " Trilobites are one of Earth 's first animals , and they lived shallow seas , " Mrs. Zinn explained as Lily rubbed and smooth stone belly of the creature . " In fact , everything lived in the seas back then - there was no life on land . If we were to go back I imagine it would be dull , since we ca n't go into the ocean where the action was . I think the weather was humid in many places , and of course there were no trees to cool things off - just rocks and mountains and volcanoes . I 'm most sure I 'd trust myself to go back that far . There 's always the possibility I 'll be hurt or get sick and wo n't be able to create the proper state of mind to come back . And then where would we be , with no other people and only seafood to eat ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best time to go back to . " What other old objects do you have ? " <p> " Besides this seal from Crete . I might have some jewelry from my grandmother , dating to the beginning of this century . " <p> The beginning of the century did n't seem nearly long enough ago to be interesting . Lily picked up the green seal again . " I wonder .. should we go back and see what happened to Phyra ? Maybe we can even help her since we know what happens later ! " <p> " Now , Lily , that 's the one thing that I 'll ask you not to do , " said Mrs. Zinn sternly . " If I take you back in time with me , you must promise not to try to do anything grand and heroic to save someone 's life or prevent a disasters . You must not even tell anyone about the flood and invasions I told you about . It may seem like a good idea to you , but you ca n't tell what the consequences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent this invasion of Crete , perhaps a more violent culture ( although that 's hard to imagine ) would have invaded them some years down the line . For example , many years ago a very kind-hearted friend of mine went back to 18th-century France because she was fascinated by the French boy who would have otherwise died . This boy grew up , married , had many children , and as it turns out one of his descendants was the man who designed the first bikini , of all things ! It was very scandalous in my tie , but now it 's every woman 's dream to be as thin as a rail so she can wear a bikini . I tell my friends every time we meet that she 's quite responsible for all diet fads nowadays . Of course she feels badly , but she says she should n't let the poor boy die when she , being a nurse , knew exactly how to cure him . So there you have it , Lily , and let that be a lesson to you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to leave to go to Crete . Thanksgiving was pretty soon as she was sure her parents would expect her to be at home for that . " Wo n't my parents be worried if we stay away too long ? " Lily asked . <p> " The convenient thing about time travel is that it takes no time at all in the present . We can go and return and still have time for your lesson ! " Mrs. Zinn looked pleased . Lily was sure she would n't want a flute lesson after being in Crete ! After some discussion , they decided to go back to Crete the next week , during Lily 's flute lesson . <p> Lily packed up her flute quickly and opened the door . Sometimes Mrs. Zinn talked a little too much , Mrs. Zinn laid a hand on Lily 's arm . <p> " One last thing , Lily . You must not tell anyone that you 're a time traveler . Because time travel can change history , those of us how do it pledge not to broadcast the information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Okay , " Lily said , too excited to think about such details . <p> " And Lily , " Mrs. Zinn continued , " you must try your best not to get hurt or sick in Crete . Because if something were to happen to you - if you were to die - it would be as if you 'd never existed in present time ! " <p> Lily ran out the door . " Do n't worry , Mrs. Zinn . I 'll do everything you say ! " And she jumped into the waiting car . <p> Illustration ( Girl and woman having tea in sitting room ) <p>
