Lil ' Kim raps about loving-and losing-Biggie Smalls . by Peter Castro Photograph " They killed my man . They killed my best friend , " says Kim ( at home in New Jersey with Biggie 's ashes ) . // A tiny rapper copes with a B.I.G . loss NOT EVEN DEATH COMES BETWEEN rapper Lil ' Kim Jones and her late boyfriend and mentor , gangsta rapper Christopher Wallace-better known to fans as Notorious B.I.G . or by his street tag , Biggie Smalls . After Biggie , 24 , was killed in a drive-by shooting last March in Los Angeles , Kim moved into his Teaneck , NJ. , two-story condo , where she follows a daily ritual that she says keeps her in touch with her fallen lover . After tumbling out of bed , she walks to the living room , picks up the mahogany box that contains half of Biggie 's cremated remains ( his estranged wife , Faith Evans , keeps the other half ) , and gently kisses the polished wood . " I do n't do anything before I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saying hello to him gives me the power to face the day . " Since meeting the 6 ' ' 5 " , 300-lb . Biggie five years ago in the Brooklyn ghetto where they grew up , Kim , a former drug courier , had relied on him for more than just reaffirming power . When Kim was a shy 17-year-old , Biggie , whose prophetically titled album Life After Death . . " Til Death Do Us Part remains on Billboard " s Top 10 , convinced her to try rap . She quickly became the only female member of Biggie 's troupe Junior M.A.F.I.A . When their 1995 debut CD went gold , he convinced his five-foot **31;473;TOOLONG to go solo . Kim 's debut album , Hard Core , went platinum June 3 , transforming her into one of rap 's most successful purveyors . She 's also , by far , one of the raunchiest .

( Warner Music Group execs did not return numerous requests from PEOPLE seeking a comment about Kim 's lyrics . ) Despite-or perhaps because of-such lyrics , Hard Core recently spawned its third hit single , " Crush on You , " and Kim hopes to take her NC-17 act on the road as part of an all-star hip-hop tour this August-just as Biggie would have wanted . " Biggie was my love , my brother , my father and my boyfriend , " says Kim . " He loved me and I loved him and I do n't care who knows now . " That includes Evans , 24 , an R &B; singer Biggie wed in 1994 , and with whom , unsurprisingly , Kim is not on the best of terms . Kim says Biggie married Evans ( who declined to talk to PEOPLE ) only after Kim told him she was n't ready for marriage herself . Still , Kim says , she resented Biggie for marrying Evans , with whom he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( a daughter , T'yanna , 3 , is from a previous relationship ) . Though Kim wo n't say whether she was romantically involved with Biggie during his marriage , she was there for him when he and Evans separated months later . " He was in a marriage that was n't working for him , " Kim says , sitting in Biggie 's living room next to a stack of yellowing newspapers bearing headlines such as " The BIG Sleep " and " Blown Away . " " I was there before he even met Faith . It 's hard to let go of something you had . " Photograph " If he had asked me to marry him recently , " says Kim ( left , with Biggie at the ' ' 95 BillS board Awards ) , " I would 've bought the dress that day . " " I 'm sure I 'll fall in love again , " says Kim ( in Manhattan in June ) . " But right now I 'm just trying to live and make money . " Biggie 's wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ video shoot in April . // Kim says she would like to patch things up with Evans , whose single , " I 'll Be Missing You , " a tribute to Biggie , has become a No. 1 hit . " It has to end , " says Kim of the bad blood between them . " Faith and I were never friends , but I have to understand her pain and she has to understand mine , " Kim adds . " It has to end now because she 's going to see me if she brings her son to visit his grandmother . " ( Biggie 's mother , Voletta Wallace , also lives in her son 's condo . ) " I 'm here every day . " Much of every day is spent with the condo 's other residents , Junior M.A.F.I.A . ' s diminutive rapper Lil ' Cease ( short for Caesar ) and Biggie 's manager Damion Butler . On March 9 in Los Angeles , both were in the back seat of a GMC Suburban when the fusillade killed Biggie , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is under investigation . ) Chain-smoking on Biggie 's king-size bed , next to nine pairs of size 13 EEE shoes that have n't been moved from the floor since Biggie died , Cease , 19 , recalls that " a dark little car rolled up on the side of Big 's door when we stopped at the light and just started firing shots at him . After he got hit , he did n't say nothing . Just straight quiet . " " All Biggie wanted , " says Kim , " was to live and be rich . " Though she rejects any connection between rap 's highly charged lyrics and her boyfriend 's demise , Kim admits that the genre 's volatile lyrics are behind many a rapper 's fortune . " That 's what made us our money , " she says . " That 's what our fans wanted to hear . It 's hard to rap about something other than people being murdered and crime . We do n't want those things to happen " - in addition to Biggie 's death , rapper Tupac Shakur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just telling it like it is . It may take time before we all start rapping about flowers . " For her part , she adds , " I still rap hard-core . " For Kim , growing up in Brooklyn 's Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood , the core of life itself was hard . Her parents-Linwood , a bus driver and former Army sergeant , and Ruby Mae , a housewife  --  divorced when Kim was very young . She and her brother , Christopher , now 24 , remained with their father , but his spit-and-polish ways-he would wake her up by banging a stick on her headboard-drove her out of the house at 15 . " I used to think her father 's strictness was proper , but I do n't anymore , " says Ruby Mae , 46 , who works as a secretary in a New York City housing agency . " I was raised in a strict home and I put those values on my children , but maybe she kind of rebelled against that . " Staying with friends and broke , Kim turned to peddling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was 12 , though , she maintains , " I never sold on the streets . " ( She also insists she never developed a drug habit despite experimenting . ) " I used to help the guys cut it up . I did it to survive . I 'm surprised it did n't wreck my life . " Enter Biggie , former crack dealer and aspiring rapper . " We would see each other in the neighborhood and we got close , " says Kim , who took his advice and traded the drug trade for rap in 1992 . In 1995 , a year after a hit with his debut CD , Ready to Die , Biggie formed Junior M.A.FI.A . and molded Lil ' Kim into a profane vamp and star . Ruby Mae , for one , was n't surprised . " When Kim was 2 , " her mother says , " she would get into my high heels , put on lipstick and sing in front of a mirror . Her father would call me concerned and say , This girl 's crazy . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm platinum right now , " Kim boasts . " There are n't too many men that can say that . " The question now is whether she can survive professionally without her image-maker . " Biggie 's death made Kim a stronger person , " says her mother . " Without him here , she discovered that she is strong enough to make it on her own . " Kim agrees . " When Biggie died , " she says , " I thought I was going to be on drugs or commit suicide . I was giving up , but Biggie was talking to me not to . " Indeed , she says , " Biggie helps me . The other day I was writing and I said , " Yo , Big , I 'm stuck . " Five minutes later , I had the line . I talk to him . I come in . I kiss his urn . I know what he 's saying . " Photograph Damion Butler ( left ) , Kim and Cease relax outside their condo .
