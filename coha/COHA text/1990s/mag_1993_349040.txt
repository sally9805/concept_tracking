In the first three months after his Inauguration , Bill Clinton managed to do what the Republicans could n't accomplish in a full year of campaigning : make George Bush 's environmental record almost look respectable . First the new Administration let operations begin at an Ohio hazardous-waste incinerator  --  the world 's largest  --  that both Clinton and Vice President Al Gore had opposed during campaign swings through the state . Then the White House backed away from a plan to help preserve vast stretches of public land in Western states by raising fees and tightening rules for ranchers , miners and loggers who use federal resources . It even cut the proposed budget for the Environmental Protection Agency below what was requested by the previous Administration . " EPA would have been better off if Bush had been re- elected ! " said a chagrined Ralph De Gennaro , senior budget analyst for Friends of the Earth . <P> So when Clinton stood up among the palms and ferns at the U.S. Botanical Gardens to deliver his Earth Day speech last week , his toughest critics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the presidential campaign . When the speech was over , you could almost hear the environmentalists heave a communal sign of relief : their new President showed he really does have a green streak . Reversing a stand that Bush took at last year 's Earth Summit in Rio , Clinton declared that the U.S. would sign an international treaty to protect the diversity of living species . And the President followed through on a pledge that briefly seemed in jeopardy : he committed the U.S. to a specific timetable for curbing the release of carbon dioxide and other so-called greenhouse gases believed to be causing a long- term rise in temperatures around the globe . <P> Of the two initiatives , the global-warming plan will be much more controversial and tougher to carry out . It calls for a rollback of greenhouse- gas emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000 . The announcement represents a major victory for Gore , whose support for the measure met resistance at the last minute from Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary . They argued that the effects of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a position reminiscent of the one the Bush Administration took last year when it torpedoed a similar plan at the Earth Summit . <P> Though Gore has prevailed for now , the debates within the Administration may be just beginning . As with health-care reform , the President put forward the bold outline of a plan and ordered his staff to figure out how to accomplish it  --  in this case , by August . We 'll give you the details , he was saying , when we work them out . <P> That will not be easy . America was built on cheap and seemingly unlimited supplies of carbon-based fuels  --  wood , coal , oil and natural gas . With only 5% of the world 's population , the U.S. today produces nearly 25% of global carbon emissions . If nothing is done , the country will be pouring 100 million more tons into the atmosphere by the turn of the century .
