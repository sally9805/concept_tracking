<p> ' FOREIGN CRUISE SHIPS WO N'T HELP THE PORT ' <p> Editor  --  Your editorial ( " Protectionist Sea Law May Get the Heave-ho , " June 16 ) is off course . <p> The parasites of the travel industry and some port authorities in California ( including San Francisco 's ) claim that permitting foreign-owned , foreign-built and foreign-crewed passenger ships to call between U.S. ports will create a windfall of riches for San Francisco . <p> The analysis of the cruise industry 's impact on the city is based on wishful thinking , not economic reality . <p> Given the most optimistic projections , the jobs created by allowing foreigners unrestricted access to our port would be minimal . Little shipyard work would be created except for minor maintenance , as the operators of these vessels perform large repairs or overhauls in foreign shipyards in the off-season . The visions of a huge influx of cash from passengers patronizing local restaurants and hotels is pure fantasy , as all meals and rooms are included in passenger ship fares . <p> Simply stated , the port @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The dangerous part is that the Port of San Francisco , perhaps unwittingly , has joined forces with other organizations representing foreign and domestic interests that would scuttle all statutes that foster the U.S. merchant marine in the domestic trades . Those cabotage laws include , in addition to the Passenger Vessel Services Act , the Jones Act which requires that cargo transported by sea between U.S. ports be in U.S.-owned , U.S.-built and U.S.-crewed vessels . <p> U.S. flag operators have invested billions of dollars in the domestic trades : building and repairing their vessels in the United States , employing American workers and paying U.S. taxes . If foreigners want to operate between U.S. ports , let them also play by the rules of the game in this country : build in the United States , hire U.S. citizens and comply with American laws . <p> Instead of attempting to sabotage the U.S. merchant marine , The Chronicle should be actively assisting in its revitalization . <p> GUNNAR LUNDEBERG <p> President <p> Sailors ' Union of the Pacific <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> THE GOOD OLD DAYS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sick . Today , those who claim to be his followers ( Pat Robertson , et al ) seek to deny health benefits to gay people . <p> Oh , how I long for the good old days ! <p> MICHAEL CHOLEWA <p> Oakland <p> . <p> A DIFFERENT BAPTIST <p> Editor  --  Let me go on record to say that this straight Baptist is very proud of Disney 's stance on inclusion . I applaud Disney for its insightful and courageous depiction of the joys and struggles of lesbian and gay life in the famous " coming out " episodes of " Ellen . " I applaud the pro-family stance which Disney has taken by offering health benefits to all families in its employ . <p> It is time the church got off its high horse of judgment and remember that Jesus called us to love one another , even those with whom we differ . It is a sad day for people of faith when a secular corporation exercises more positive moral fortitude than does the church . <p> A Mickey/Minnie fan and proud of it ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Francisco <p> . <p> DOWNTOWN TRANSIT CENTER <p> Editor  --  I am amazed to see , thus far at least , no argument against Willie Brown 's demolition of the downtown San Francisco transit center plan . <p> It is interesting that the mayor sees the development of his city mainly in terms of sports teams : to keep these here , he is glad to see any number of millions of dollars be spent and to foster creative schemes whereby as few millions as possible will go out of the public coffers . <p> However , when it comes to less showy projects , like over the course of years keeping and expanding the financial strength and importance of downtown ( and a transit center 's role in the development of the area from Rincon Annex to the ballpark )  --  suddenly the mayor begins to count the millions of dollars . <p> He and others who have thrown up their hands at the expense of a downtown transit center should visit a few towns in Germany and Japan , for example , to see how ingenuity and modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the courage to do so . <p> RICHARD HEIDELBERG <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> EXTEND BART INSTEAD <p> Editor  --  A life-long Peninsula resident and longtime CalTrain commuter into San Francisco , it astounds me that " an overwhelming majority of San Francisco and Peninsula residents " ( Chronicle , June 18 ) favor a downtown CalTrain station . At $ 220 million , the corridor from S.F. to San Jose was a real-world gift when purchased from Southern Pacific Railroad in 1991 by the Peninsula Corridor Joint Powers . <p> Given the per-mile cost of extending BART these days , Peninsula residents might consider their enviable opportunity to redress 25 years of non-participation with BART by redirecting the local , state and federal monies earmarked for both the proposed downtown station as well as the voter approved BART airport extension toward a more comprehensive , public serving system . Invest in the future , not a hole . <p> RICK PEDRETTI <p> San Mateo <p> . <p> A MEANINGFUL APOLOGY <p> Editor  --  Re : Apologizing for slavery . . . <p> An apology for the institutionalized enslavement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , much worse , is hardly enough and is very long overdue . Unfortunately , a national apology will be made to look like " South " bashing by Senate Majority Leader Trent 's Lott ( and his party of hyper-capitalists masquerading as conservative and Republican ) . <p> A much more meaningful apology for the vulgarity of slavery would come voluntarily from the Confederate slave states which took the nation to the brink of dissolution over a simple matter of basic civil rights , fairness and human dignity . <p> RAND KNOX <p> San Rafael <p> . <p> DAMS VS . NEZ PERCE <p> Editor  --  Initially , the story about the Nez Perce returning home to Wallowa County ( " Nez Perce Reclaim Land of Chief Joseph , " Chronicle , June 13 ) sent chills down my spine . <p> Then I read on . I learned that the Bonneville Power Administration , beneficiary of Snake and Columbia rivers power generation , put up $ 4.5 million for the land with an option on an adjoining 5,000 acre site . The land for fish swap was billed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hydroelectric dams . . . " <p> How quaint , how cozy , how brazenly cynical . <p> The presumed quid pro quo strikes at the core of Nez Perce culture and beliefs . Paraphrasing from Nez Perce historian Alan Slickpoo , losing the Snake River salmon is like going to church one day and all of a sudden discovering someone has removed all the Bibles . How about harnessing tribal Appaloosas to pull apart some Snake River dams ? <p> MICHAEL BLACK <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> BUILDERS MOB TAHOE <p> Editor  --  How many scientists and government officials does it take to figure out why Lake Tahoe is in crisis ? Developers and real estate interests are having a field day developing this environmentally sensitive area ever since the building moratorium was lifted a few years ago . <p> In my neighborhood alone , the housing density has tripled in the past five years . There are currently six homes for sale on my block alone , and the other lots are being cleared and built upon . . . not by people who chose this area for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish to make a quick buck . <p> Developers can go to Reno where urban sprawl is welcomed . As far as Tahoe goes , the resounding message to any further building is to just say no ! <p> A.C. CHARLES <p> Kings Beach
