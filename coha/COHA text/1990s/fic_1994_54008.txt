KERRY , MY LIVE-IN LOVER , is uncertain about our future . She tells me this in the Addiction/Recovery aisle of Stacey 's Bookstore in Cupertino , only sound and picture are not in sync . I see Kerry 's lips move . I feel the soft explosion of her breath reverberate with sound . But my lingering image of this moment will forever remain not of her soft skin , not her fabulous blue eyes , nor even her taut mouth whose lingual penetration was all that occupied my free time these last few weeks ; it will be of the horror novels just beyond her , their matte black covers oozing blood onto her auburn-red hair while soft Muzak plays " Moonlight Sonata , " drowning out the manifold reasons we can not continue to live together . <p> " Joe is picking me up , " she says , turning to go . <p> " Joe ? " <p> Early this morning the actress Lauren Rogers died , and with her my first and only real shot at working on a feature film . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . I loiter about the bookstore in a funk , my mind obsessed with the film , with Kerry . <p> My beeper sounds . <p> Coolridge , Coda 's director , appears on my remote , the tiny chip-screen I pull from my waistband . She 's in L.A. , at home . She looks like she needs sleep or at least a good smoke . <p> " Ron 's having the wake at the house tonight , " she say . " He expects you down here about eightish for dinner . Howard , he fully intends to finish the film . " Her image mail ends abruptly in a burst of colored confetti . <p> I should be happy that I still have a job , happy that I do n't have to buy any of the career manuals I 've just leafed through . I am not . I 'm still upset . So for my trip down to L.A. tonight , I buy a horror novel , one with metallic blood dribbling down its matte black cover . I buy it because the woman screaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's death came as no surprise . I remember Coolridge as most livid during those first forty-eight hours after Lauren collapsed in the middle of a scene last January , much more so than Ron , Lauren 's husband and Coda 's producer . What few shoots we needed to finish principal photography were mostly close-ups and Ron felt we could scrap those of Lauren if it came to that . Coolridge disagreed . <p> " I 'm not going into editing strapped with only a master shot and almost no choices . Dammit , Lauren was getting good . I want choices . " <p> So Ron acquiesced . <p> The following morning I was in the Bay Area to conference with execs from Digitex . Perhaps you know the company . Two years ago they caused a stir with their Marilyn Monroe commercials : the singular way the dead actress , standing over that same New York steam vent she made famous almost forty years ago , turns and invites the home viewer to try her brand of feminine hygiene protection . Had Digitex not won a Cleo that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then and there . <p> So the day after Lauren entered the hospital , I was in a tiny Silicon Valley conference room , watching Digitex 's animation of Lauren Rogers on a twenty-nine-inch Sony . It was good . Having known her on and off the set , I thought they 'd captured much of her personality in the forty-second clip . <p> That 's what Ron wanted to hear . After one long conference call , we had a commitment to go . <p> That evening I celebrated with Ron and Coolridge over dinner back in L.A. <p> " Lauren 's responding to medication , " Ron said . He stabbed at his t-bone steak as though it was trying to leap off the plate . " Her prognosis is very good . She 'll be back , they tell me , ready to loop dialogue , in no time . " <p> " Bullshit  --  she 's dying , " Coolridge said . " You bastard , you kept that she was HIV positive from everyone . Even me . " <p> " Patricia , you ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled . " She 'll be back to work in a few weeks . " <p> " A few weeks , huh ? Then what 's Howard doing moving up to Cupertino ? " <p> Ron , who could have played poker with the best and won , just looked at me as though seeing me for the first time and smiled . " Some insurance work . That 's all . " <p> Five hours after Coolridge called to say Ron was serious about finishing Coda , I arrive at Ron 's house in L.A. The horror novel I read on the Bullet Train now rides low , just inside my jacket pocket , and Lew Spencer , the agent who receives me at the door , sees it and smiles . He asks if I 'm secretly scripting the book for him on spec . When I say I 'm not , he just laughs . <p> " Send it to me when you finish Coda . I have a feeling you 'll be much in demand after Coda . " <p> Without response , I take a complimentary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Ron 's house overlooks the Los Angeles Basin . It is past sunset , almost night when I arrive , so the City of Angels spread out below , with all its lights , looks about as real as the background of any local TV news set . This is the satellite-shaped house where DePalma lensed part of Body Double so I wander around the living room , recreating the moments from the film I once wrote about while doing my undergraduate film studies . I see many old faculty and classmates of mine mingling . I am still surprised to see the ol ' boy network alive and well in this town of ego-slashing cutthroats . <p> Someone taps a glass , and all conversation abruptly ceases . <p> Ron stands atop the kitchen table , an urn in his outstretched hands . He invites a moment of silence as Tibetan monks march out of the bedroom , chanting , wafting the kind of incense which irritates my nose . Someone else sneezes . After this , Ron then relates a few anecdotes about Lauren 's struggle to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to his wife 's mortality , he seems strangely calm this evening . Even jocular . <p> " She said , at the end , ' Honey , with the kind of films I 've made , I 'm so used to dying . . . . ' " <p> The music starts again and Coolridge calls me over . At first she wants to know how it 's going , so I tell her about Kerry , about Joe . But Coolridge 's eyes begin to wander , her attention begins to follow . I ask her about the film , our mutual bond . <p> " Well , " she says , staring me down , " I do n't like Digitex 's rushes . Oh , do n't take it personally . I just do n't think this techno-crap can salvage Coda . " <p> I nod and look out the window , distracted . Someone has lit fireworks in the Canyon . Red , blue , and yellow fire blossoms peak outside Ron 's house . Watching them , I feel further removed from the party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sneaked aboard the Queen Mary in Long Beach , and watched the fireworks intended only for paying guests . So long ago . . . . <p> " Howard , " says Coolridge , ending my reverie , " I 'm not in control anymore . " At first I consider the drink in her hand , the slur to her speech , and quite possibly her sense of balance . Then I realize what she means . <p> " So file a grievance with the Guild . " <p> " By the time they rule , the film will be out . " She watches my eyes widen . " Oh , yes . Ron still intends to premiere Coda in New York and L.A. by the final week in December . A Golden Globe , if not an Oscar . You can buy the Globes at least . " <p> I shake my head . " We 're not even close . We 're really pushing the technology up there . " <p> " This is n't about technology . For a man who 's just lost his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . Least of all technology . " <p> At that moment I happen to see our host , the film 's producer , good ol ' Ron , atop the piano , doing a jig . He turns and perhaps he sees his director and her assistant . Perhaps because he smiles and waves when I smile back . <p> " This is about something larger , " Coolridge continues , behind me . " Something more . . . " I turn and find that Coolridge has gone out onto the balcony to vomit . <p> Back in Cupertino the morning after Lauren Rogers ' wake , I watch the dead actress smile and give her lines on a tiny Sony monitor . Flawlessly . Watching this , I hear Coolridge 's doubts recirculate in my mind . <p> " It 's too smooth , " I say , slamming down my coffee mug . " Can you . . . ? " <p> They can not . Even before I ask , I see their answer . These patient Digitex techs . <p> Susan , the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been putting up with me for the last two months without a protest , utters a single word : " Context . " <p> J.D. , her assistant who also might have been under instruction not to ruffle my feathers , agrees . " Yes . You know , Howard , the Kuleshov effect . " <p> I lean back in my chair , amazed . For the last two months , I 've sensed these Digitex employees to be little more than digital hackers , graphic artists who dream only in bytes and hexadecimal beauty . Instead , both have film degrees . Moreover , they might even have a point . <p> The Kuleshov effect , if I may digress , is when three or more shots  --  say a baby , a coffin , and a woman crying  --  are cut together . Did the woman lose her baby ? Did the dead husband leave behind a grieving wife and child ? Has the woman simply lived and died a sad life ? Given the above information , each scenario is plausible . It 's all in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first cut scene . It will be the first incorporation of live action with our digital recreations . In the morning we 'll know . <p> That night Coolridge calls . It 's a hot evening unusual for the Bay Area . While my small Cupertino apartment has amenities like air conditioning I 've chosen to save the Antarctic ozone and simply lie atop my bed in plaid boxers . Coolridge pretends not to notice . She 's in town for the screening tomorrow morning staying at the same Howard Johnsons I had , and from the narrow view visible behind her , I further see that it might even be the same room . <p> " The whole thing is funny , " Coolridge says , not at all amused . " I should have realized Coda was n't my picture from the start . Remember our production schedule ? " <p> I did . We did a master shot for every scene within the first two weeks , and spent the rest of the time doing the cutaways . That 's backward . It 's expensive . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Not with the new toys you 're playing with . " Coolridge spies something on my bed , smiles . " Bordwell and Thompson . Latest edition . I too broke out my copy of Film Art the other day . Mine 's a first edition , however . " <p> I nod . I 'd gone back to Stacey 's and for a " computer bookstore , " their film and film-making section is quite good . I 'd gone there initially for the Thalmanns ' texts on computer graphics , which of course they had . These , now scattered on my bed alongside the tenth edition of Film Art , did n't much interest Coolridge , however . <p> " Spline Algorithms . P-curves . Pixel ratio . These are n't film terms , " she says . " You 're no longer working on a ' film , ' Howard . You 're making a Saturday morning cartoon . " <p> I say nothing . She is drunk , perhaps nervous about tomorrow morning 's screening . <p> " When I was in film school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cameras and used little tape-splice editors . We had impromptu screenings in dark custodial closets in the journalism building late at night . I only got into TV because people I trusted said that I 'd one day get into films . Well , look at me . I 'm forty and I 'm still not making films for a living . You , however , are lucky . There are only a few people in this town who work only in film . Film is an art , remember that . Video . . . is a wasteland . " <p> EIGHT A.M. the next morning , we gather in the Digitex screening room . Coolridge , who joined me for breakfast , now smokes neurotically while Ron , who flew in only moments before , stands behind us in the projection booth . He is supervising the union projectionist 's loading of the first intercut sequence of Coda . <p> The lights dim . The scene , originally shot in front of a New York town house on the New Paramount backlot , lasts a mere two minutes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or was it Digitex ? <p> Or maybe the Kuleshov effect . <p> All of Lauren 's close-ups in the cut scene were digitally rendered . She never spoke a word of the dialogue in real life . And yet her co-star , an actor very much alive today , seemed more wooden , almost dead on screen when compared with Lauren 's simulation . Something 's wrong , I think . <p> " Assuming we correct the loss in image resolution , " Ron says , smiling , " audiences wo n't suspect a thing . We 'll have our hit after all . " <p> Coolridge shakes her head . " Holly 's one of the best editors working but she needs more freedom . I ca n't put constraints like this on her choices . " <p> " Nonsense , " says Ron , smiling more like a televangelist . " It 's like the New York City Street set we used at Paramount  --  it all looks fine until you turn the corner . Careful editing will keep everyone on the tour . " <p> I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Coolridge 's camp . I ca n't say , however , that I agree with Ron either . My sympathies do , however , go out to the poor actor upstaged by our glitzy computer graphics . <p> By noon , both Ron and Coolridge depart again for L.A. I am to stay and continue working with Digitex until further notice . We are to finish in one month . <p> When I return home , I find that Kerry has called my machine . Several times . The " thing " with Joe did n't work out . She wants to move back , only I 'm not convinced . I take my bike out and spend the rest of the day cycling the foothills of Stevens Creek Park , considering . Later , exhausted from my ride , I 'm still not convinced . <p> In replaying Kerry 's messages , I notice that she does not say " I was wrong " or " I 've reconsidered . " She says only that the " thing with Joe " did n't work out and I just now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only smudged mascara . <p> Joe has given her forty-eight hours to vacate . <p> That night I mix a new tape of Kerry at the Digitex studio . <p> Kerry 's longest message lasts less than one minute . I begin with the background , stripping it away . She sits in a kitchen that must be Joe 's Santa Clara address because low flying aircraft into San Jose International garble the sound on two of the four calls . Neutral light , no shadows , I know that the window faces north , the camera south against a midday sun . I isolate her face and have the computer trace her vowels , then certain , telltale diphthongs . From this new database I begin to script a new monologue . <p> While I 'm at it , I clear up her left eye and brighten her overall demeanor . She now smiles like no other , this new talking head of Kerry . She now expresses her unending love for me in no uncertain terms . <p> " How could I have underestimated your love for me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Please , please take me back . I was wrong . " <p> Using a Quantel Paintbox , I seat her near the pool at the Fairmont Hotel in downtown San Jose . I mix in the sounds and motions of people laughing and splashing into the pool behind her . She 's using a cellular phone and near the very end , I have a waiter lean in with a glass of fine Napa Valley Cabernet . <p> Two hours later , I 'm satisfied although the rough cut plays on the monitor in only ragged composites . Along the lower portion of the frame , strings of hexadecimals race , representing colors , sounds , and camera positions not yet rendered . This new message from Kerry lasts one minute twenty . I like the length so I instruct the machine to interpolate the missing frames , to smooth out motion within the frame and to correct for color . <p> Did I position the sun in front or behind her ? Damn . I slip out for coffee while the machine silently contemplates this . <p> At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked and now a young man has filled in her vacant position , a call comes in for me . It is Coolridge . She sounds satisfied . She 's left the production . She 's quit Coda . <p> " My suggestion , kid , is that you do the same , " she says . " What we 're doing here is sick . It has nothing to do with art or reality . He 's taken our creative control and mass-produced a blockbuster that I 'll have no part of . Nor should you . It 's manipulative . " <p> I think of that when I return to the editing suite to watch a beautifully , albeit artificially , rendered Kerry swear her eternal love . Watching this , I realize Coolridge 's point first hand . It is manipulative . <p> Often a producer will retain the final cut of a film in exchange for someone 's directorial freedom on the set . Changing a film 's ending can be expensive  --  often rehiring cast and crew and possibly going on location - but sometimes the change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fatal Attraction . So what Digitex has created is a producer 's ultimate toy -a relatively inexpensive way of manipulating an actor or a director 's vision long after principal photography 's completed . <p> It is a , producer 's way of having the final word . <p> Without hesitation , I queue up Kerry 's original phone message and relearn that the " thing " with Joe is n't working out . I decide then and there that neither is this animation stuff . Reality may not be perfect but I kind of like it that way , and when I get home , I see that Ron has called . He wants to do lunch in L.A. , tomorrow . Great . I decide to go , if only to hear what he has to say . <p> " ' All progress , ' " Ron quotes to me , " ' is the result of people who took unpopular positions . ' Adlai Stevenson once said that and I happen to believe it 's true . " <p> We 're standing at Pink 's on La Brea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beer . If this is his idea of networking with my generation , he 's missed the point . Behind us passes a cherry-red convertible of cool dudes and hot babes , the rumble of their THX-mastered downbeat sounding like the Big One . <p> Ron , holding a shriveled frankfurter that is oozing relish and mustard precariously near his Pierre Cardin tie , looks ridiculous in his Gucci suit , a speck of conservatism amid the casual dress of Hollywood mid-afternoon . " We ca n't fight change , can we , Howard ? " He 's pointing the hot dog at me now . <p> " So what did Lauren think of change ? " I ask . <p> " Her last picture was a dud . Do you think she wanted Fools ' Night Out to be her last picture ? Would you ? " <p> I restate my question . " So what did Lauren think of spline algorithms generating her best and final performance ? " <p> He looks away . " She wanted to keep working until the end . She wanted no one to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " So I take it you kept your holdings in Digitex a secret from her . " <p> His eyes flare . " What makes you think I even have any interest in that company ? " <p> " Because , according to the current Digitex prospectus , you purchased controlling shares of stock about the time the Monroe commercial hit . It was a gamble  --  I 'll credit you that  --  but to use it on your wife . . . . " <p> He rests against a plastic chair . He is unable to speak , unable to take his eyes off me . I feel their pressure , their force upon me . <p> I no longer care what he thinks of me because I am now certain of my opinion of him . <p> " I was going to offer you directorial credit on Coda , " he says , softly . <p> I should be flattered . The credits you see on the screen are often not in reality the names of those who made the film . They are the names the unions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye blink , all of Coolridge 's hard work fades into blackness . Instead , for those same five full seconds , it is my name that is luminescent on the silver screen as director before sound and picture both fade in over a faux New York street scene . . . . <p> " No . " My decision is firm , though my voice is not . I start to walk away from him , my bravado quivering , failing me now . " No way . " <p> " Then you 'll never work in this town again . " <p> " Actually , " I call out , " I have yet to work in this town . But I get your drift . " <p> My Cupertino landlady insists I 'll find more work in the Bay Area . Actually , she does n't want to screen new tenants . But all the action is truly in LA-LA land , so I tell her I 'm moving back . Reluctantly , she posts the FOR RENT sign in the courtyard . <p> I return to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Coolridge waiting on my machine . She says ever since news of her resignation surfaced , she 's gotten hot . She says there are at least three development deals on her desk , and one is in the Bay Area . Whichever one she chooses , she still wants me as her right hand man . A call following hers , from Lew Spencer , confirms it . I save both recordings for future reference , then start packing . <p> It is mid-afternoon when I finish , when I get a call from Kerry . She 's a mess , somewhat hysterical , and she needs to know what I 've decided : if she can move back , or whether she should make other arrangements . I say , hey , no problems , no hard feelings . I 'll leave the key under the front mat . Yeah , I add , if you 'll just give me another half hour , I 'll even meet you at Stacey 's Bookstore down the street and after we can go play video games in the shopping mall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oblivious to the fact that in another half hour I plan to be traveling south along I-5 toward L.A. I have no intention of staying in Cupertino any longer than I have to . I have no real intention of ever seeing Kerry again . Her fantasy , not mine . <p> Reality , it may not always be perfect , but I kind of like it that way . <p> <p> By Robert Vamosi <p> Robert Vamosi attended Clarion West Writers Workshop last summer .
