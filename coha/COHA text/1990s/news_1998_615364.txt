<p> Neal Horsley , the Carrollton creator of an Internet site criticized for targeting abortion providers , said Tuesday he received a threatening letter claiming to contain deadly anthrax . <p> Horsley , whose Web site is being investigated by the U.S. Justice Department in connection with the Oct. 24 shooting death of a Buffalo , N.Y. , doctor who performed abortions , said he opened the letter at the post office on Monday and immediately turned it over to the Carrollton Police Department . <p> Law enforcement agents believe the letter was a hoax , but it has been sent to a federal laboratory for analysis , which will determine whether it contained the lethal bacterial agent . <p> " As soon as I grasped what it was saying , I immediately folded it back up and put it back in the envelope , " Horsley said Tuesday . " I had no reason to suspect there was something wrong . " <p> Horsley , a 54-year-old computer consultant , said the letter was in a business envelope with a clear window listing his address . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The message was printed and centered , with the first line reading , " You have been exposed to anthrax . " A second line , also centered , listed a strain of the bacterium , which Horsley could not remember . The third line " just berated me . " But by that time , the father of three said he was so shaken , he returned the letter to the envelope without reading it . <p> Similar letters were received by two Catholic parishes in Indianapolis and Cheektowaga , N.Y. , as well as the Chicago office of the Pro-Life Action League . The letters sent to Indianapolis and Chicago also had Texas postmarks . The letter to the New York church was from Illinois . All were received Monday , according to published reports . <p> After Horsley brought the letter to the police department , officers triple-wrapped it and put it in an evidence can before calling the Federal Bureau of Investigation , Capt . Brad Robinson said . " We did n't actually look at the letter , " the Carrollton officer said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dangerous . " <p> The FBI did not return phone calls for comment Tuesday . <p> Horsley went through a hazardous material washdown at Tanner Medical Center in Carrollton as a precaution . " They brought out the rubber suits and the breathers , " he said . Tim Padgett , director of the Carroll County Emergency Management Agency , confirmed the West Georgia Regional Hazardous Material Team was called out to decontaminate Horsley . Horsley was expected to be fingerprinted by the FBI for agents to determine which prints on the letter are his and which ones are n't . <p> Anthrax is an infectious bacterium used in biological warfare . When inhaled , it can cause respiratory death within a week . <p> Horsley , a 1985 graduate of Westminster Theological Seminary near Philadelphia , was thrust into the spotlight after he crossed Dr. Barnett Slepian 's name off a list of 225 doctors on his Web site , after Slepian was shot to death in his Buffalo home . Horsley 's Web site , " The Nuremberg Files : Visualize Abortionists on Trial , " features images @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a list of doctors who perform abortions . Some doctors ' names are accompanied by personal information , such as photos , home addresses , names of children and wives . When a doctor is killed , the name is crossed off . When wounded , the name is grayed . <p> Four Georgia doctors are on the list . None would publicly comment on the site . <p> Gloria Feldt , president of Planned Parenthood , mentioned the site in a national news conference the day after Slepian 's death , accusing Horsley 's Web site of inciting violence . <p> Horsley denied Feldt 's claims and said Planned Parenthood has slandered him and endangered his life and his family 's . <p> " No one really knew I existed until she did this , " he said . <p> In a statement from Planned Parenthood , the organization disagreed that he was virtually unknown before the killing . <p> " Violent , anti-choice extremists have known about his site for quite some time , " according to the group 's statement . " We wanted to make sure the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His Web site speaks for itself . " <p> Since the shooting death of Slepian , Horsley said , the site has had more than 2 million " hits , " or instances of computer users calling up the site . Two days after the Planned Parenthood news conference , he said , he recorded 400,000 hits . Internet specialists said there is no way to verify or contest Horsley 's claims . <p> Horsley said he started the Web site about three years ago after he could not find a publisher for his books . Formerly a Southern Baptist , Horsley said he essentially was " excommunicated " from two churches after heavily pushing an anti-abortion agenda . <p> But the Internet allowed him the freedom of speech he craved . His site , with 15 categories , contains everything from lists of doctors to where to get anti-abortion posters and literature . <p> " I think I 've been made to sound like I 'm nonchalant about the death of this doctor . But that 's not it , " he said . <p> " What the problem was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even though he 's been given permission by our government , I contend no one can take the life of another without risking their own . " <p> But Horsley said he plays no part in the violence against abortion providers . He says he is a reporter who merely is soliciting and providing information . Critics argue Horsley 's Web site is designed to foster violence . <p> " It may not come right out and say , ' Go out and kill these people , ' but with the blood dripping around the list , I think it 's certainly implied , " said Sharon Lau , a National Abortion Federation spokeswoman . <p> The Justice Department on Monday named a task force to examine violence against health care providers . The panel also will look at Web sites  --  with Horsley 's being at the top of the list , according to Justice Department officials . But Associate Attorney General Raymond C. Fisher said it was unclear whether there could be " a specific remedy for it . " <p> Several free speech organizations maintain the Web site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The American Civil Liberties Union says it naturally is concerned about the First Amendment issues . However , ACLU spokeswoman Emily Whitfield says the organization 's focus right now is Slepian 's slaying . <p> " The First Amendment issues are complicated , " she says , " but what is very important to us is that a man has been killed in cold blood . When civil rights leaders in the 1960s were gunned down , they were n't talking about hate speech  --  they were talking about murder . " <p> " The site is chilling , " says Barry Steinhardt of the Electronic Frontier Foundation , staunch and vocal advocates of free speech on the Net . " But it does n't advocate violence , it does n't advocate the providers who are listed be harmed . In fact it actually provides very little information about the providers besides their names . <p> " While I find it disturbing and chilling . I do n't know how you would write a law that prohibits a Web site from publishing the names of abortion providers that also prohibits the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referrals and information .
