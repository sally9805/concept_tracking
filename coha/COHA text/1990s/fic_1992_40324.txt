We stood in an empty house looking at a walk-in closet . At least Mom and I did ; Dad stood by the window smoking a cigarette and pretending to ignore us . We had been house-hunting for three days , and Dad had been cranky since the middle of the first day , when he realized just how much house he could expect for his money ( double what he could get in the States , but there was no telling him that ) . By now he was impossible . As the real-estate agent ran down the history of the house , he gazed out over the red-tiled rooftops with a look of growing misery . The sun flowing into the dark room etched pits and hollows into his face until he looked as harsh as a monk in a medieval woodcut . <p> Mom leaned in to inspect the closet . She nodded her head at the shelves , confirming their existence , doing the polite thing , making the agent happy . <p> " Walk-in closet , " Dad muttered . " We do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been living in Mexico for almost two years , since shortly after my father retired . They chose Tonala because of its superb climate  --  second only to Nairobi 's , everyone said  --  and because it housed the largest expatriate community of retired Americans in the world , nearly a hundred thousand of them . There were book clubs , garden clubs , eating clubs , golf courses galore , the American Society and its many functions , and Mom and Dad had quickly gathered a group of friends . Now Mom wanted to buy a house . She promised Dad his own garden , his own library . It would have a high wall , Mexican style . An oasis . They 'd pay for it in cash and never have to worry about rent again . <p> Dad was n't persuaded . He spoke again , louder : " We do n't need a walk-in closet . " <p> Mom avoided the agent 's look . She spoke with patient reason , as to a child . " There 's nothing unusual about a walk-in closet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I do n't need one and I do n't see any point in spending a small fortune to have one . " <p> This was one of his tricks for getting out of something he did n't want to do : simply saying he did n't feel like it would be rude , by his lights , so he worked up a steam of indignation until we gave in to his bad mood . He brought his cigarette to his mouth . The cigarette had a very long ash , nearly half its length . We all looked at it . Despite the slight trembling of Dad 's hand , the ash did n't fall . <p> " Maybe we 'd better come back another time , " Mom said to the agent , giving her a **26;0;TOOLONG social smile . <p> In the car she opened her purse in her lap and began adjusting her makeup . We waited . " Really , Richard , " she said . " Must you embarrass me like that ? " <p> Dad said nothing . <p> " That was a perfectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " It had a swimming pool , " Dad said . <p> Mom made a tch sound . <p> " There 'll be bills , " Dad said . " Cleaning bills , heating bills , bills for chemicals and whatnot . I do n't need a pool . You do n't need a pool . " <p> " It might be nice to go swimming , " Mom said . <p> Dad scowled . " I 'd say your swimming days are over . " <p> Mom was silent for a moment . Finally she spoke . " Thank you very much , " she said , a stop in her voice . <p> Watching from the back seat , I thought Mom was overdoing it a bit , enjoying the melodrama of a personal offense . " Looked like a great house to me , " I said . <p> They ignored me . But I knew it would be best to continue to fill the silence , that being one of the primary functions of children . So I babbled . " The acoustics were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living room , big kitchen , loved all that tile work , it was just great . " <p> That was for Mom . Now for Dad : " Of course , I do n't see what you want to buy a house for down here anyway . I mean , California , that would be cool , near the beach , but that 's me , and you guys have your own priorities and needs and stuff , which I guess include living in this Godforsaken , disease-ridden , macho , sexist country . " <p> " I 'm not sure I do want to buy a house , " Dad said . " Your mother is the one who insists on it . " <p> Dad flipped on the turn signal and glanced at the lane to his right , his face dark with concentration . Mom did n't speak until there was a break in the traffic . " Honestly , " she said . " You talked to the accountant . You talked to Dr. Joe . You were the one who said we should do this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the point of actually doing something , you make everything impossible . This happens every time we try to make a decision . " <p> Dad just compressed his lips and looked out his side window . Mom could see that continuing the conversation was pointless , and we rode the rest of the way home in silence . <p> When we got home  --  home that year being an apartment near midtown  --  Dad went straight into the kitchen . After a moment we heard the clink of glass and bottle . When Dad emerged , glass in hand , Mom gave him a critical look , which he ignored . " I 'm going to read , " he said , heading for his bedroom . <p> Mom shook her head and sighed , moving toward the kitchen . I followed . " Are you hungry ? " she asked . <p> " I thought I 'd go out for a while , " I said . " Get some tostadas . " <p> I leaned against the counter as she went through the refrigerator . The kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls . " This is the way it 's been , " she said . " He 's been this way ever since he retired . I honestly do n't know if I can stand it much longer . " <p> She shifted a few Tupperware containers in search of something . <p> " Come on , Mom , " I said , thinking she was being melodramatic again . " You 're not talking ... divorce ? " <p> " I 've thought about it , " she said grimly , wiping her mayonnaise knife clean with two definite strokes against the edge of a slice of bread . <p> I was quiet for a few moments , giving ritual gravity to Mom 's statement even though I did n't remotely believe it . Now she was setting up a tray with salt and pepper shakers and a placemat , good china , a Steuben crystal glass , even a miniature vase and one small rosebud . In our house there was always a flower on every tray . <p> Divorce : the thought annoyed me . The confidence annoyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had n't even seen much of the folks for the past seven years , since I was sixteen and they got hysterical over some minor recreational drug abuse . I got into college early , came home once or twice for vacation  --  the last time two years ago , the year Dad retired and I graduated from college . That was another disaster . So I was surprised and a little flattered  --  and secretly pleased  --  when Mom called me up and said that Dad was n't doing very well , could I come down ? <p> " This 'll blow over , " I said . " He 's just having trouble adjusting to retired life . " <p> " Some trouble , " she said . She looked the tray over , aligned a fork , picked it up , and started for the door . <p> " Maybe if you did n't wait on him hand and foot , " I said . <p> " He should eat , " she said , taking the tray to his bedroom . <p> When she opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed , propped up on his elbow with a cigarette in one hand and a book in the other . He turned a page and looked up , his expression vague . As Mom carried the tray to the bed , he shifted to make room for it and his cigarette ash fell on the bedspread , which was already burned in a half-dozen places . " Oh , Richard , " Mom said , quickly brushing the ash away . <p> Escape ! I shot down the stairs of our small apartment building ( pillbox balconies , smell of damp cement ) and burst out onto the street . The street was narrow here , choked with trees that split the sidewalks , but down a few blocks was a broad divided boulevard with grass and trees and fountains in the middle and a statue on every corner . At one end stood a huge sculpture of the Child Heroes , a few dozen schoolboys who had fought the North American imperialist armies with primitive guns and no grown-up supervision ( they were slaughtered , of course , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge grocery store , an example of the recent national fad for giant mercados . For a while I just strolled around looking at girls . Finally I ducked into my favorite tostada place  --  wherever I was , I always found a favorite restaurant and always ordered the same thing  --  and ordered two beers and tostadas , which I wolfed down with sudden hunger . Then I picked up my head and inhaled the balmy , flowered air : jacarandas , bougainvillaea , gardenias . It seemed a terrible injustice that there was no one around to have sex with . <p> The next morning at nine-thirty mom was already walking around the apartment , picking at things . She fluffed the pillows on the sofa . She ran a finger across the lid of a cigarette box . " I told him we were leaving at ten , " she said . " This is just like him . " Then she turned to me and confided , " He was up all night . " She called out his name . <p> " I 'll get him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door and knocked once , twice , pushed it open . The room was dark and stank of cigarettes . Dad lay on his back , his mouth open , his fringe of gray hair tufted from his skull . I touched his leg to see if it was warm . <p> " Dad , " I said , shaking him by the shoulder . " Dad . " His eyes opened . It took a moment for him to focus . He gave me a weak and pitiful smile . " Oh , " he said , clearing his throat . <p> " Mom 's getting antsy , " I said , my voice cold . " She wants to get going . " <p> " I 'm getting up , " Dad said . He folded back the covers . His body seemed smaller than I remembered , his legs and arms brown and wiry , his belly pregnant and white . As he sat up , the fly of his boxer shorts gaped open . <p> Dad sat on the bed , his feet on the floor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big toes had extremely thick nails that curved sideways , making his feet look almost deformed . The toes were bright red . <p> " What 's wrong with your toes ? " I said . <p> Dad said nothing . <p> " They look infected , " I said . <p> Dad grunted dismissively . He put his hands on his thighs and moved forward into a half-crouch ; then he pushed off the bed , balancing and straightening at the same time . He faced me , gave an absent nod , and then bowed his head and reached for his robe . <p> An hour later he was dressed in his uniform of double-knit pants and guayabera , an open-necked Mexican " dress " shirt , which seemed to me quite a comedown from the expensive suits he used to wear . His face was like a shirt from a suitcase , clean but creased . We rode the elevator down to the garage and got in the car and drove off , Dad maddeningly slow at everything from locking the front door to getting the car out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door , Dad said , for the third time in as many days , " This is an electronic door . We have all the latest improvements here . " <p> Despite his hangover , he was trying to be hearty , a proper member of the stoic generation , the Depression generation that never complained , that took pride in bluffing their way through the day no matter how bad they felt ( except for those occasional explosions ) . This annoyed me , and I stayed glumly silent . How could he resolve his problems if he ignored his feelings ? When I had a hangover , I babied myself . <p> An hour later Mom stood in the middle of a kitchen as the real-estate agent threw open cabinets . The agent was talking about how wonderful it was that this house had so much storage space . Mom oohed and aahed . " Is this a microwave ? " she asked . " That 's the first one I 've ever seen . " <p> " Mom , " I said , " we owned a microwave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant down here , " she said . " You hardly ever see them down here . " She turned to Dad , who was standing in the doorway trying to muster an expression of mild bemusement . " Look at that , Richard . A microwave . " Dad grunted . <p> " No walk-in closets this time , " the agent said . Mom and Dad forced out social chuckles . " There is a safe , however , " she added . <p> " That would be useful , " Mom said . " We could give up the safe-deposit box . Save a few hundred pesos . " <p> Dad put on a mock expression of joyous gratitude  --  his eyebrows went way up , his smile spread absurdly wide . " Now , that interests me , " he said . " Now you have caught my interest . You 're appealing to my deepest desires . " <p> The agent laughed . " Would you care to see it ? " she said . We trooped off to the bedroom to inspect the safe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it darker where a painting must have hung . It was gray , like gunmetal but stippled , with walls about an inch thick . The inside was just big enough to stack five or six hardback books . <p> " It looks sturdy enough , " Dad said . <p> " It 's fireproof , too , " the agent said . <p> We all stood there for a minute , staring into the gray steel box . <p> " Whats was wrong with that house ? " Mom asked bitterly an hour later , as we drove home . <p> " Am I not permitted simply to dislike something ? " Dad said . " Did I work my entire life to be forced to buy a house I do n't want to buy ? " <p> " It would be nice if you had a reason , " Mom said . <p> " I did n't like it , " Dad said . " I just did n't like it . It was too bright , or too dark , or something . " <p> " Too bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , damn it , " Dad said . <p> " I agree with Pop , " I said . " That house sucked . " <p> " Daniel , " Mom said , this time using the same exasperated tone on me . <p> " It did . It was too close , like a zoo or something , the way all the bedrooms and even the kitchen opened onto the living room . I kept expecting to see bars on the doors and some little cave in the back where the animals go to hide . " <p> " That 's exactly it , " Dad said . " I could n't have put it that well myself , son . That 's exactly it . A zoo . A Goddamn zoo . At the cost of over one hundred thousand dollars . " <p> Once again Mom sighed , chastising me with her eyes in the rearview mirror . <p> " And there was no pool , " I said , just to be a monster . Dad fell right in with it . <p> " At that price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodding . <p> Mom widened her eyes in outrage . <p> Later that day mom held out a canape tray to Frankie Day , her principal ally in the Battle to Buy a House . Frankie was about fifty , with a crewcut and bright red cheeks . He was a retired real-estate mogul , and Mom 's confidant . <p> Even though Dad was sitting right there , Mom spoke in a whisper . " We ca n't even get through two houses a day , he gets so mad . " <p> Frankie spoke to Dad with his exaggerated , ironic drawl . " Really , Richard , you ca n't expect to see just the thing you want your first day out . You know Raoul ? Who owns that little restaurant in Los Oblatos ? He spent two solid months looking , and he found that marvelous place  --  you were there on Leticia 's birthday  --  with the flowering trees ? " <p> " It is lovely , " Mom said . <p> " What did he pay , though ? " my father said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frankie a lot of respect . " I ca n't believe these prices . " <p> Frankie nodded . " Everything is going up , " he agreed . " It 's the market  --  it 's absolutely wild , and I do n't think it 's going to get better . " <p> Mom gave him a look . " At least not soon , " Frankie said quickly . He knew the rules . <p> But it was too late . Dad went off on a fret about the local stock market . For the past year or two it had been his personal gold mine , and every time he 'd mentioned it he had preened like a proud father . But he also seemed to worry about it constantly . What if it were all a delusion , a mirage ? What if he lost his guayabera ? These doubts made him even more fiercely loyal . When I wondered out loud if the Mexican stock market was the best place to put his money , he gave a little chuckle that said he knew better . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dad started asking fearful questions . What have you heard ? Which stocks are weakening ? <p> Finally Frankie and Mom managed to steer the subject back to the house . " You know , Richard , " Frankie said , " if you want to save money , the best places are outside Chapultapec altogether . Even Providencia is getting expensive . " <p> Mom had suggested this dozens of times , but Dad would have none of it . <p> " You can get a mansion out at the lake for ... " <p> " I will not live at the lake ? " Dad blurted . <p> Mom frowned at him ; his sudden vehemence was inappropriate . " Richard , " she said . <p> Dad shook his head and waved his cigarette , refusing to be shushed . " Everyone we know lives here , " he said to Frankie . " Margaret would n't want to live too far from here . " <p> " Nobody said we had to buy at the lake , " Mom said . " We 're just talking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dad continued . " It 's too damn remote from everything . It 's isolated . There 's no hospital . I just do n't like it . " <p> " Okay , " Mom said . <p> " Well , damn it , " Dad said . <p> Frankie and Mom sipped at their drinks while Dad pouted . <p> " I always liked the lake , " I said . <p> Frankie took over again . " What you want to think about , Richard , is somewhere out on the outskirts , like Chapalita or Oblatos . Quiet , close to town , cheap . Lots of people are moving out there now . Rancho Contento is a lovely place , for instance . " <p> " Which one ? " <p> " The one near Oblatos , away from the barranca , " Frankie said . <p> " The one that changed its name ? " Mom said . There had been a lawsuit between the two Rancho Contentos , and one was now called Rancho Mirage , but everyone still enjoyed the confusion and refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Remember , Richard ? Where Dette and Bo live ? The Breeces , from Texas ? " <p> Dad shrugged . <p> " And Serena , the actress , " Frankie said . <p> " It 's nice , is n't it ? " Mom said . " Remember the cobbled streets ? " <p> Dad nodded grudgingly . " I do n't think I could live in a place named Rancho Contento . " <p> " It really is a charming place , " Frankie said . " I hear you can get a three-or four-bedroom house with a half acre for about sixty thousand American . That wo n't buy you maid 's quarters in Chapultapec . " <p> " Sixty thousand ? " Dad asked . <p> Dad was weakening , and Frankie ran with it . He mentioned the convenient shopping center , and the advantage of access to the back road to the airport , and the popular Aguas Calientes hot springs nearby . The Rancho even had its own little nine-hole golf course , splitting the older , top half of the development from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any course in the area . There were lovely places to walk . It was well protected , surrounded completely by a wall , and always had a guard at the gate . Not to mention the convenient Club Deportivo de Tonala , with its tennis courts , indoor pool , and popular bar . And the nearby town of Los Oblatos was so historic . " You know the Arabian Nights , that marvelous little restaurant , " Frankie said . " With the patio ? We ate there . With the peacocks ? " <p> All this was according to Mom 's plan . We were n't surprised when , immediately after Frankie left , Dad solemnly observed hat perhaps we should look a bit out in Rancho Contento , despite its awful , unfortunate name . <p> Mom looked at me and rolled her eyes . <p> Later DaD confided in me . " Your mother prefers it here , " he said , " but it 's just too damned expensive . I ca n't afford to buy here . I have to think how she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The next morning Mom made a few calls , and by lunch we were driving out to Rancho Contento . It was a rustic-looking private development with wide , rough-cobbled streets , completely surrounded by a mossy brick wall . In the lower half most of the houses had open lawns , in the American manner , but above the golf course the streets wandered into the foothills and the houses all had walls . There were even a few crumbling haciendas dating back to just before the Mexican Revolution , huge shady estates as quiet and timeless as monasteries . On the widest of five avenues horses moved slowly along the dusty center divide . I looked exactly like an older Mexican neighborhood , but without any of the dark little corner stores that sell nothing but bread , sodas , cigarettes , gum , and tired-looking fruit . <p> Dad had never been above the golf course before , and was quite impressed . As we explored , the real-estate agent told us the peculiar history of the Rancho . It was originally settled near the turn of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Alaska gold rush and came south to found the proverbial gleaming city on a hill . But the American got chased out by the revolution and returned north a broken man ; not only was his wife killed in the fighting , but his sister took up with a young Mexican revolutionary and actually carried a rifle into battle by his side . The American left behind only a few scattered haciendas and the rough outline of imagined streets . <p> Half an hour later we were standing outside a huge house . We were in the highest part of the Rancho , where the streets parted around giant gnarled cottonwoods and all the gates looked like entrances to Aztec tombs . The house before us was at least fifty years old , maybe sixty , one of the first large places built on the hillside after the revolution . The wall around it was massive , ten feet high and at least two feet thick . The agent was saying we could get the house " for a song , " because the owner wanted out quickly . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Mom did n't say anything . The agent pushed open the door . Inside , the house was dark and dusty ; Mom 's nose wrinkled in immediate distaste . At the back of the foyer a curving staircase rose up to a narrow balcony . On one side was a living room , on the other what seemed to be a library . " Well , " Dad said . e was still standing just inside the door . " It 's quite baronial . " <p> The agent said the house was selling for just ninety thousand dollars . Dad appeared to be pleasantly surprised  --  this house was twice the size of the ones we had been looking at . <p> Mom ran her finger along a table and brought it up for inspection . It was black . She looked at the ceilings dubiously . <p> " It has n't been cleaned for months , " the agent said quickly . " Not since the owner went back north . " <p> " It is dusty , " Mom said . <p> " Look , Margaret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Dad led the way into the library , admiring the floor-to-ceiling bookshelves . He then posed himself with his back to the fireplace and actually clasped his hands behind his back . The agent smiled . <p> " Does it work ? " Mom asked , nodding at the fireplace . <p> " Of course it works , " Dad said . <p> " Yes , it works , " the agent said . She led us back through the foyer and across the living room to a set of French doors . The opened unto the back yard . She opened the doors and displayed the yard with an upheld hand . " No pool , " she said . <p> Mom narrowed her eyes and sniffed . <p> By the time the tour was over , Dad was clearly in love with the crumbling old house . He went on and on about its charm and scale and what a wonderful place it would be to entertain . Mom was pointedly silent . When we got to the foyer , Dad said he thought we should make an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , took Dad 's arm , and smiled sweetly at the real-estate agent . " Could we have a moment ? " she asked . <p> The agent said she would wait in the car ; we could just close the door behind us when we were finished . The minute she got out of sight , Mom exploded . <p> " I ca n't believe you , Richard , " she said . " Here you are , ready to make an offer . Look at this place ! It 's huge . " <p> Dad looked confused . " I thought you wanted space , " he said . <p> " Space , not a warehouse , " Mom said . " This place is so old , I 'll bet anything it has a million things that need repairing , old rotted this and that and rusted pipes and whatnot . You ca n't just make an offer . This place should be surveyed by a professional . We do n't know what we 'd be getting into . And why has it been on the market for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine cleaning it ! " <p> Dad appeared to be dumbfounded . " Well ... , " he said . " I thought ... " <p> " You did n't think , " she said , turning and walking out the door . <p> After a moment Dad looked at me and shrugged . I shrugged back . " Looked okay to me , " I said . <p> That night dad went on one of his horrible benders . Mom and I sat in the living room talking in hushed voices , and every now and then Dad would come walking through in his boxer shorts with a crystal water glass in his hand . He 'd nod his head to acknowledge us . Once he said , " Still up ? " <p> " I do n't want him going with us , " Mom was saying . " He gets so upset , and then this . I 'm afraid he 'll have a heart attack . " <p> " He 's going to feel awful in the morning , " I said . <p> " I hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I always go in there wondering . " <p> After a moment I suggested that I stay with Dad while Mom went house-hunting alone . " I mean , if it upsets him that much . " <p> " You know your father , " Mom said . " There 's no way he 'll let me go alone . " <p> " Why do n't we commit him to a mental institution for a week ? " I said . " We 'll say it 's a case of temporary insanity  --  ours , if we do n't get him out of our hair . " <p> Mom laughed . Then she sighed . " I wish I could , " she said . <p> At that moment I noticed something dark on the floor . <p> " What 's that ? " I said . " Look . " <p> It was a bloody footprint . Looking down the room I saw another , and another , and another , a whole series of bloody footprints leading to my father 's room . <p> " He probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not getting up . " He 's done it before . " <p> I went to the pantry where we kept the liquor , looked around , and came back out . " No sign of any glass , " I said . Mom got out of her chair and we headed toward Dad 's room . We knocked , heard a grunt , and pushed open the door . Mom gasped . The whole bottom half of Dad 's bed was soaked with blood . Dad was lying there reading , completely oblivious . <p> Twelve hours later we stood at the foot of Dad 's hospital bed . Mom was shaking her head . " You really are a strange and stubborn person , " she said . Dad looked sheepish . <p> His feet , it turned out , were horribly infected after being gouged deep and long by two fierce ingrown toenails that had actually imbedded themselves nearly half an inch into the pulp of his big toes . Apparently he 'd been trying to dig out the ingrown toenails with a nail file when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three stitches . Then , it seems , he 'd given up his efforts at home surgery , dabbed at the wound with his sheet , and gone to get another drink . <p> We left Dad in his private room and walked down the hall with Dr. Joe . <p> " It 's really not that serious , " he said . " What 's surprising is that he let it get that bad  --  he must have been in pain for months . Anyway , I can have him out of here tomorrow . " <p> Mom 's reaction was instantaneous . " Oh , no , " she said . <p> Dr. Joe looked at her curiously . His hair was going prematurely white  --  he was n't much more than thirty  --  and that , combined with his stodgy bedside manner and the medicinal smell he gave off , made him seem almost as old as his patients . <p> " Ca n't you keep him for a while ? " Mom said . <p> Dr. Joe laughed . There were people waiting for the bed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mislead an adult patient about his true condition . Besides , Dad would kill him if he ever found out . <p> " If he keeps drinking the way he has been , " Mom said , " he wo n't live long enough to kill you . " <p> Dr. Joe puffed out his lips and clasped his hands , tapping his thumbs together . <p> " You know how he is about spending money , " Mom continued . " This house thing has got him rattled so ; I 've never seen him like this . If you could just keep him for a week , we could buy something and it would be over . " <p> Dr. Joe pondered . " He really should n't be drinking with his EKG , " he said . <p> " He smokes two packs a day , " Mom said . <p> " More like three , " I offered . <p> Dr. Joe nodded and said that maybe keeping Dad for a week 's detox would n't be such a bad idea . He was amazed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through , he said . Maybe a week in the hospital would put the fear of God into him . <p> Mom said she thought that was a great idea . <p> When we got back to his room , Dad was offering his pathetic smile to a nurse , who was shaking her head and saying no , no , no . " Por favor ? " Dad said , holding up a finger and speaking in a voice full of mock anguish . " Solamente uno , solamente uno . " <p> " Eres un hombre muy malo , Senor Sinclair , " the nurse said , shaking her finger back at him . " Tu sabes aqui no se puede fumar . " <p> He was begging for a cigarette . <p> With Dad in the hospital , house-hunting became much more efficient . Instead of touring every house at length ( Dad thought that saying no at first glance would insult the agent ) , Mom took a quick walk through and said it would never do . In this way we got through three or four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit Dad and tell him about the day . Though he would never admit it , the old man seemed relieved to be out of the picture . Most of the time when I came in , he was flirting with a nurse , playing the pitiful invalid to cadge a cigarette or a smile . The nurses seemed to get a big kick out of him ; the lecture Dr. Joe had apparently given him had worked , giving him an apologetic , sheepish quality that made him , I had to admit , pretty damn lovable . <p> I learned not to dwell on the specifics of a house ; some detail was sure to set Dad off . I tried to stay vague and bright . When things got tense , I diverted the subject to my latest scheme for making money : I was thinking of importing fire agates to the States with the help of a Mexican kid I had met at the tennis club . Dad was always pleased when I showed signs of entrepreneurial enthusiasm . But he seemed happiest of all when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'd seen that day , as if that were a sign of our toughness as buyers . He was very concerned that we were not tough buyers . <p> Mostly we played chess . Once or twice I beat him , and Dad praised my playing . " You 're a natural player , " he said . But he added immediately that I was too hasty , too impatient , and the unhappy speculations these criticisms raised about my future turned him dark for the day . <p> Once , he told me I was growing up " to be a fine young man , " which left me in shock . <p> Four days after dad entered the hospital , the real-estate agent told us that another house had become available in Rancho Contento . It was an emergency sale , solidly below the market price , and another buyer was already interested . We drove right out . It was the Pink House . Mom loved it at first sight  --  the gazebo and cactus garden out front , the faded pink paint a perfect pastel against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that doubled as an entrance , the arched brick ceilings ( also white ) , the red-tile floors , the flagstone back porch with its awning heavy with vines , the narrow staircase to the roof choked with bougainvillaea , the swimming pool with inlaid angelfish winking from the bottom , bubbles of white tile rising from their mouths . It was a lovely place , a true oasis , abstracted by high white walls from the dust and tumult of Mexico . <p> " It 's lovely , " Mom said . The agent watched us with a knowing smile . <p> Without showing any particular enthusiasm ( she was canny in that way ) , Mom asked the agent about price and closing costs and so on . It was selling for around eighty thousand , which was at least ten and probably fifteen thousand dollars below the going price for that much house in that neighborhood . <p> As we drove away , Mom asked me what I thought . <p> " It 's nice , " I said . <p> " Did you see the kitchen ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The yard ? " <p> " Dad 'll freak about that pool . " <p> Mom gave her head a little impatient shake and actually said pooh . She nodded her head several times and gripped the steering wheel . " I 'm going to make an offer , " she said very firmly . <p> A few days later we were ready . Back at the hospital , I went in to talk to Dad first  --  the shock troops in Mom 's battle plan . " Build it up , " she had told me . And I did . " It 's really beautiful , Dad , " I said . " It 's like the perfect house . " <p> " You say it 's pink ? " Dad asked , frowning . <p> " Yeah . You can paint it if you do n't like it . " <p> He seemed very skeptical . " Yeh , " he repeated , mocking my diction in a blatant attempt to stall for time . <p> " You 're focusing on the negative , " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , Mom 's in love with it , and it 's really a great house . It 's everything you wanted . It 's even cheap . " <p> " I would n't call eighty thousand dollars cheap . " <p> Patience , I told myself . " You 'd pay twice that in Chapultapec , " I said . <p> Dad shook his head , dubious about my statement and the general state of the world . <p> " But the Rancho , " Dad said . " I really do n't think your mother will like being so remote . " <p> " Dad ! She loves it ! She 's the one who wants to move there ! And you 're the one who wants to save money ! It 's perfect ! You 're driving me crazy ! " <p> Dad continued to shake his head . " I do n't know . " <p> " Dad ! You have n't even seen it ! " <p> Calm down , I told myself . This is not productive . Dad lifted his hand to his mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's hard for me to think , " he said , indicating with a slight wave the absent cigarette . <p> " Blackmailer , " I said . <p> He smiled . <p> Mom and Dr. Joe were waiting out in the hall . Mom gave me a questioning look . I shrugged . " He wants a cigarette . " <p> " The condemned man , " Mom answered wryly , unsnapping her purse and pulling out her pack . Dr. Joe shook his head and said he could n't approve of this at all , but he seemed amused . We all trooped into the room , me in front holding the cigarette forward like a white flag . Dad snatched it as soon as I got within range . He examined it . " I should n't smoke this , " he said . <p> He was n't talking about health . Mom had given me one of her American cigarettes , which cost twice as much as the local brands . Dad was offended by the lapse in his sterling record of self-denial . But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhaling deeply and gratefully . <p> " A pink house , " he said , shaking his head at the world 's infinite peculiarity . <p> Mom pulled a chair up to the bed and sat down , all business . She 'd been hard at work since finding the house , and already the offer had been accepted and the purchase contract had been vetted by our lawyer . It was now in an envelope in the purse on her lap , waiting for Dad 's signature . <p> " A pink house , " Dad repeated . " It sounds like something for a chorus girl . " <p> Mom made the pooh sound . <p> " I 'll tell you right now , " he continued , taking another deep drag on his cigarette . " I will not live in a pink house . I will never live in a pink house . " <p> We returned the next day with Frankie . " Look at the fabulous invalid , " Frankie said as he swept into the room . " I hear you 're flirting shamelessly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no , not me , " Dad said , too heartily . " I 'm too damned old . " <p> He did n't look well . His toes , however , poking from the bottom of the sheet so that the infection would get air , had gone back to nearly a normal color . <p> " You look like hell , " Frankie said . Dad chuckled weakly , and Frankie leaned over the bed and pulled something out of his pocket . I saw the flash of glass . " Do n't abuse it , " Frankie said . It was a half pint of vodka . Dad looked puzzled at first , and then smiled with touching gratitude . <p> " So , have you heard about your gorgeous new house ? " <p> Dad pushed the bottle under the covers and reached for his bedside glass . " Can you empty this for me ? " he said . As I headed for the bathroom , Dad turned to Frankie and answered , " I do n't know about that . " <p> " I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is really , truly a beautiful place  --  you will absolutely love it . The yard ! The garden ! And I 'm telling you , as an investment you could n't do better . You know they 're expanding the shopping center and building a whole new development between Oblatos and the turnoff  --  that whole part of town is coming up faster than downtown Dallas . " <p> " Margaret did n't tell me about a development , " Dad said , taking the empty glass I held out . He clamped it between his legs , unscrewed the vodka top , and poured out a fist of booze . <p> " Well , " Frankie said , his tone forgiving . " She 's just in love with that house . " <p> " What about the neighborhood ? " Dad asked , taking a grateful first sip . <p> I slipped out and went to the office , where Mom sat gossiping with Dr. Joe . " How 're they doing ? " Mom asked . <p> I shrugged . " He 's listening . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a little bitter . She knew exactly what I meant . Dad would give Frankie the respectful attention he could never give a member of his own family . <p> It took a few more days . Dr. Joe helped too , painting the house as an oasis where Dad could finally find the peace to reform . In the end Dad was ready to sign the papers . Dr. Joe and Frankie were there to give last-minute support . Mom handed Dad a pen . <p> " I need a cigarette , " he said . <p> " Richard ... , " Dr. Joe scolded . <p> " For God 's sake , " Dad said . " It 's a huge amount of money . " <p> " Oh , give the poor man a cigarette , " Frankie said . Mom opened her pack and handed Dad a cigarette . <p> " Two , " Dad said . <p> She gave him two . <p> The next day I went to pick dad up . Dr. Joe was finally releasing him . I wondered if Dad knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his family and friends to force him into buying a house he really did n't want to buy . He seemed frail as he walked to the car , bent from the week in bed . He shuffled ; maybe his feet still hurt him . His head hung . I could see his gray hair clumped against his neck , which seemed as rough as elephant skin . It made me feel tender and sad . I opened the car door and held back a branch so that the old man could squeeze into the shotgun seat . It took a few long moments . <p> " Let 's go visit the house on the way , " I suggested . " Have a look at what you bought . " <p> " Oh , no , son , " Dad said . " I do n't ... " <p> " Come on , Dad , " I pleaded . I wanted to be there with him , see the pink house through his eyes . I wanted him to like it and be happy " Mom gave me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't talk much as we drove out to the Ranchu . Finally I pulled the car up outside the wall and helped Dad to the gate . I unlocked it and pushed it open and stood back . " Ta da , " I said . <p> For a moment he just stood there , looking through the gate at the faded pink house . His face showed no reaction , but his eyes were hooded and a bit sad . There was a little foreboding in them , a little anxiety . In the flame tree that rose above the gazebo to the left , a bird trilled a long series of notes . The tree was in flower , and Dad , looking up in the direction of the bird , let his eyes linger on the bright orange blooms . Then he looked back at the house where he would live until he died . He sighed once and began walking toward it , moving past me without a word , composed and ready to inspect his fate . <p>        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
