Standing with my brother Arnie on the edge of town has become a yearly ritual . My brother Arnie is so excited because in minutes or hours or sometime today trucks upon trailers upon campers are going to drive into our home town of Endora , Iowa . One truck will carry the Octopus , another will carry the Tilt-A-Whirl with its blue and red cars , two trucks will bring the Ferris wheel , the games will be towed , and most important , the horses from the merry-go-round will arrive . For Arnie , this is better than Christmas . This beats the tooth fairy and the Easter bunny : all those stupid figures that only kids and retarded adults seem to stomach . Arnie is a retard . He 's about to turn eighteen and my family is planning an enormous party . Doctors said we 'd be lucky if he lived to be ten . Ten came and went and now the doctors are saying , " Any time now , Arnie could go at any time . " So every night my sisters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed wondering if he will wake up in the morning . Some days you want him to live , some days you do n't . At this particular moment , I 've a good mind to push him in front of the oncoming traffic . My oldest sister , Amy , has fixed us a picnic feast . In a thermos was a quart of black cherry Kool-Aid , all of which Arnie drank in such a hurry that above his top lip is a purplish mustache . One of the first things you should know about Arnie is that he always has traces of some food on his face  --  Kool-Aid or ketchup or toast crumbs . His face is a kind of bulletin board for the four major food groups . Arnie is the gentlest guy , but he can surprise this brother . In the summertime , he catches grasshoppers and sticks them in this metal tab on the mailbox , holding them there , and then he brings down the metal flag , chopping off the grasshopper heads . He always giggles hysterically when he does this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , when we were sitting on the porch eating ice cream , a countless sea of grasshopper bodies from summers past must have appeared to him , because he started weeping and sobbing like the world had ended . He kept saying , " I killed ' em , I killed ' em . " And me and Amy , we held him close , patted his back and told him it was okay . Arnie cried for hours , cried himself to sleep . Makes this brother wonder what kind of a world it would be if all the surviving Nazis had such remorse . I wonder if it ever occurs to them what they did , and if it ever sinks in to a point that their bodies ache from the horrible mess they made . Or are they so smart that they can lie to us and to themselves ? The beautiful thing about Arnie is that he 's too stupid to lie . Or too smart . I 'm standing with binoculars , looking down Highway 13 ; there is no sign of our annual carnival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rummaging around in the picnic basket . Having already eaten both bags of potato chips , both peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches and both chocolate donuts , he locates a green apple and bites into it . By trying to ignore Arnie 's lip-smacking noises , I am attempting the impossible . You see , he chews as if he 's just found his mouth and the sounds are that of good , sloppy sex . My brother 's slurps and gulps make me want to procreate with an assortment of Endora 's finest women . It 's the twenty-first of June , the first day of summer , the longest day of the year . It is n't even 7:00 a.m. yet and here I stand , little brother in tow . Somewhere some smart person still sleeps . " Gilbert ? " " Yeah ? " Bread crust and peanut-butter chunks fall off Arnie 's T-shirt as he stretches it down past his knees . " Gilbert ? " " What is it ? " " How many more miles ? " " I do n't know . " " How many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Three million . " " Oh , okay . " Arnie blows out his lips with a sound like a motorboat and he circles the picnic basket , drool flying everywhere . Finally , he sits down Indian style and starts quietly to count the miles . I busy myself throwing gravel rocks at the Endora , Iowa , town sign . The sign is green with white printing and , except for a divot that I left last year at this time with my rock throwing , it is in excellent condition . It lists Endora 's population at 1,091 , which I know ca n't be right , because yesterday my second-grade teacher , Mrs. Brainer , choked on a chicken bone while sitting on her porch swing . A great loss is felt by no one . Mrs. Brainer retired years ago . She lived half a block from the town square , so I 'd see her pretty much every day , always smiling at me as if she expected me to forget all the pain she 'd inflicted . I swear this woman smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the store , her sack of groceries ripped . Cans of peaches and fruit cocktail dropped out onto the floor , cutting open her toes . My boss and I saw this happen . She pushed up a real big grin as the tears fell off her cheeks . I resacked her cans , but she could n't stop smiling and crying , and her toes could n't stop bleeding . I 'm told that when they found her on the porch , her hands were up around her throat , and there were red scratch marks on her neck , in her mouth , and pieces of flesh under her fingernails . I wonder if she was smiling then . Anyway , they took her body to McBurney 's Funeral Home in Motley . They 'll be planting her tomorrow . " Gilbert ? " " What ? " " Uhm . " " What ? " " Uhm . The horses , the rides , the horses are coming , right ? Right ? " " Yes , Arnie . " Endora is where we are , and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to no music . It 's a town . Farmers . Town square . Old movie theater closed down so we have to drive sixteen miles to Motley to see movies . Probably half the town is over sixty-five , so you can imagine the raring place Endora is on weekend nights . There were twenty-three in my graduating class , and only four are left in town . Most went to Ames or Des Moines and the really ambitious made it over to Omaha . One of those left from my class is my buddy , Tucker . The other two are the Byers brothers , Tim and Tommy . They stayed in town because of a near fatal , crippling car accident , and they just kind of ride around the square racing in their electric wheelchairs . They are like the town mascots , and the best part is they are identical twins . Before the accident no one could tell them apart . But Tim 's face was burned , and he 's been given this piglike skin . They both were paralyzed but only Tommy lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Endora Express , pigskin Tim pointed out the bright side in all of this . Now it is easy to tell which is which . After many years Tim and Tommy have finally found their own identities . That 's a big thing in Endora these days . Identities . And the bright side . We got people here who 've lost their farms to the bank , kids to wars , relatives to disease , and they will look you square in the eye and , with a half grin , they 'll tell you the bright side . The bright side for me is difficult on mornings like these . There 's no escaping that I 'm twenty-four years old , that I 've been out of Iowa a whopping one whole time , that you could say about all I 've done in my life to this point is baby-sit my retard brother , buy cigarettes for my mother , and sack groceries for the esteemed citizens of Endora . " Gilbert ? " says Arnie . He has frosting all around his mouth and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Arnie ? " " You sure they 're coming ? We 've been standing such a long time . " " They 'll be along any second . " I take a napkin from the basket and spit in it . " No ! " " Come here , Arnie . " " No ! " " Come here . " " Everybody 's always wiping me ! " " Why do you think that is ? " " Because . " For Arnie , that is an answer . I give up on spring cleaning his face and look down the road . The highway is empty . Last year the big rides came pretty early . The trailers and the campers came later . Arnie is really only interested in the horses from the merry-go-round . I say , " Hey , Arnie , there 's still sleep in my eyes , " but he is n't interested . He nibbles on his bottom lip ; he 's working on a thought . My little brother is a somewhat round-looking kid with hair that old ladies always want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with teeth that look confused . There 's no hiding that he 's retarded . You meet him and you figure it out right away . " Gilbert ! They 're not coming ! " I tell him to stop shouting . " They 're not coming at all , Gilbert . The rides got in a big crash and all the workers hung themselves .... " " They will be here , " I say . " They hung themselves ! " " No , they did n't . " " You do n't know ! You do n't know ! " " Not everybody hangs himself , Arnie . " He does n't hear this because he reaches into the basket , stuffs the other green apple inside his shirt , and starts running back to town . I shout for him to stop . He does n't , so I chase after him and grab his waist . I lift him in the air and the apple drops out onto the brown grass . " Let me go . Let me go . " I carry him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his legs squeeze around my stomach , his fingers dig into my neck . " You 're getting bigger . Did you know that ? " He shakes his head , convinced I 'm wrong . He 's not any taller than last year , but he 's rounder , puffier . If this keeps up , he 'll soon be too big for me to pick up . " You 're still growing . You 're getting harder and harder for me to carry . And you 're getting so strong , too . " " Nope . It 's you , Gilbert . " " It 's not me . Believe me , Arnie Grape is getting bigger and stronger . I 'm sure of it . " I set him down when I get to the picnic basket . I 'm out of breath ; beads of sweat have formed on my face . Arnie says , " You 're just getting little . " " You think ? " " I know . You 're getting littler and littler . You 're shrinking . " Stupid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I 'm in a rut . Since I do n't believe in wearing a watch , I ca n't tell the exact time  --  but this moment , the one when my goofy brother rips the bandage off my heart , is followed by a yelp . Arnie 's yelp . He points east , and with the binoculars I locate a tiny dot moving our way . Several dots follow . " Is it them ? Is it them ? " " Yes , " I say . Arnie 's jaw drops ; he starts dancing . " Here come the horsies . Here come the horsies ! " He begins howling and jumping up and down in circles ; slobber sprays from his mouth . Arnie is entering heaven now . I stand there watching him watch as the rides grow . I just stand there hoping he wo n't sprout wings and fly away .
