King Charles I of England had several court painters , not all equally lucky . Anthony van Dyck was the luckiest of all . But how could one envy , say , Richard Gibson ? He was not only a miniaturist but a dwarf who at a court banquet had to skip from a pie and walk the length of the table bearing portraits of the King and Queen he had copied after Van Dyck on playing cards . It can not have been fun to be this small , if distinct , talent , awaiting his cue in a dark pastry coffin . But to be Van Dyck himself ? A different matter . <P> A child prodigy at 14 , a full professional by his early 20s and dead at 42 , Van Dyck had one of those careers that is conventionally dubbed meteoric  --  except that it did not burn out . His name has lasted three centuries . Which is not to say that he has altogether received his due . In a curious way , Van Dyck remains a somewhat underrated artist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Rubens , his master , and Titian , his even greater model . Especially , he is not well known to the American public , though some of his finest paintings are in America , owing to the vogue for his portraits among the robber barons of the early 20th century . Those who saw " Van Dyck in England , " organized by Oliver Millar for the National Portrait Gallery in $ London eight years ago , are not likely to forget the impact of its high- strung , cool virtuosity . But the show did not travel to the U.S. , and so the Van Dyck exhibition now at the National Gallery of Art in Washington , curated with such care and scholarly zest by three art historians  --  Susan J. Barnes , Julius S. Held and Arthur K. Wheelock Jr .  --  offers many people their first proper look at this artist . <P> Van Dyck covered a lot of territory in his short life . He was Rubens ' most gifted assistant in Antwerp , and his early ability to reproduce the style of his idol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his early paintings . What they leave no doubt of is Van Dyck 's precocity , the speed with which he metabolized the lessons of his master . In 1620 , when he was only 21 , he was hired by King James I as a court painter in London . A year later he was in Genoa , painting its nobles and dignitaries , making study trips to Rome , Florence and Palermo . By 1627 he was back in Antwerp , and by 1632 the new English monarch , Charles I , had brought him back to London , knighted him and made him " principalle Paynter in ordinary to their Majesties . " For his last 10 years he moved between London , Antwerp and Paris , accumulating honors , commissions and fame . All in all , he was as genuinely international a painter as Rubens had been , though he did not fly at quite the same diplomatic height .
