With its sexy look and funky new album , TLC can look forward to another rise to the top in the music industry . // TLC , the trend-setting trio who generated more than $170 million in sales yet ended up bankrupt , has come back after a four-year absence and soared straight to the top of the music charts . Tionne aT-Boz " Watkins , Lisa " Left-Eye " Lopes and Rozonda " Chilli " Thomas sold more than 13 million copies of their first two albums , Ooooooohhh ... On The TLC Tip and CrazySexyCool and won several Grammy Awards . Yet the trio 's members generated as many headlines in court as they did with their music that mixed rap , hip hop , pop and soul . In 1995 , they filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors with a reported $3.5 million in liabilities and not even $1 million in assets . They fought LaFace Records and their management company , headed by Perri " Pebbles " Reid , former wife of LaFace co-creator L.A. Reid . Photograph The energetic trio burst on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On The TLC ISp . The group 's loose-fitting , sagging outfits , accessorized with brightly-colored bandages , set off a hip-hop trend . // Lopes had the biggest financial nightmare . She was charged with arson and criminal damage for admitting that she torched the home of then boyfriend , Atlanta Falcons wide receiver Andre Rison . Her bail was set at $510,000 and the home in suburban Atlanta was completely destroyed . Her bankruptcy petition listed $2.2 million in debt and less than $100,000 in assets . But , all of that negativity is way behind the women who are all in their late 20s . Their latest album , FanMail , has done something that is almost unheard of in current musicit went straight to the top of the pop charts without the help of a video . The red-hot singles No Scrubs and Silly Ho have gotten tremendous airplay . The trio 's members told JET that they were as surprised as anyone at how fast the album went to the top . " Heck yeah , we 're surprised the album went to the top without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No Scrubs , all three women immediately picked at or brushed off imaginary lint and dirt from their bodies . Scrubs , they said , are guys who live off women . " Every woman knows some scrubs , " Chilli said . T-Boz added , " At Freaknik ( an Atlanta spring gathering of Black college kids from all over the country ) you see guys in nice cars , and you know it 's their mama 's ( car ) . Scrubs are guys who have no life and not trying to take care of themselves . A scrub is the ' 90s version of a leech . We have a dance called scrub it off . ' " Photograph The trio 's star power was proven in 1996 when TLC won two Grammy Awards , Best R &B; Performance By A Duo or Group for the song Waterfalls and Best R &B; Album for CrazySexyCool . Photograph The group knows how to keep its fans on the edge with innovative stage performances . // Left Eye called the song " the ladies ' anthem . " She said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We give it to you straight with no chaser . " That straight message is also very evident in Silly Ho , a song about the kind of female who ca n't get her life together . One of the group 's trademarks has been music with social messages . And there are several cuts on the new album that deal with social commentary like Unpretty , a song about the destructive insecurity that comes from trying to please others without making yourself look pretty from within . They said they called the album FanMail to pay tribute to the legions of fans they 've developed all over the world . Those fans helped them sell more albums than any female trio in history ( most 1960s girl trios sold singles ) . The trio had significant involvement in FanMail by helping to write some of the cuts . L.A. Reid , his LaFace partner Kenneth " Babyface " Edmonds and Dallas Austin produced the album as they did the previous two . Taking almost five years off at the peak of one 's popularity is a major gamble for musical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , each said she needed the break and a good album would bring fans back . Photograph The video world was taken by storm with TLC 's unforgettable music video for Waterfalls . It won an MTV Video Music Award in 1995 for Best Video of the Year . The video 's director , F. Gary Gray , joined the group in accepting the award . // " It 's all about timing , " Left Eye said . " I believe if the stuff is hot , you can disappear for 10 years and come back . As long as people appreciate the material you 're presenting them , it does n't matter . TLC needed a little TLC to ourselves . We needed time to take care of our financial situation , our record company . Chilli had a child . And it took about a year-and-ahalf to record the album . Looking back , it did n't seem like a long time to us . " During the layoff Chilli had a son who is almost 2 years old . She also had a role in the film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acting coach , " she said . " I turned down quite a few major movie roles because I want it right . " T-Boz also caught the acting bug and appeared in Belly last year . She also wrote a book of poetry and started her own entertainment company . She and Left Eye did separate album projects . Left Eye has hosted MTV 's daily show " The Cut . " One thing they 've learned in the interim is exactly how the music business works . " This is a cutthroat , evil type of business , " T-Boz said . " Education is the key . " They said people expected them to be rich after they generated so much money . But , as all three pointed out in unison , advances from the record company had to be repaid . " Then lawyers have to be paid , " Lopes said . " Managers , accountants , agents , publicists have to be paid . Not to mention on the road , hair , make-up , the band and crew . All the expenses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to split what 's left three ways . Not much money is left . Videos can cost anywhere from $250,000 to $2 million . And it costs like $150,000 to get a top producer . " Photograph // They settled their differences with creditors in 1996 and now appear to have a healthy relationship with LaFace Records . Chilli said she 'd advise anyone who contemplates a career in music to be very careful with contracts . " When you 're going over contracts , if you do n't understand , it 's alright to say ' I do n't understand it , ' and break it down so a 2-yearold could understand it . Even if you have to take the contract , leave your lawyer 's office and go to a friend 's , get the knowledge and understand what it is you 're reading because when you sign that contract , that 's your life . " All agreed that the successes , disappointments and adversity they 've had to deal with in the 1990s has made them much stronger women . And , as Left Eye said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . Whatever we 've been through personally and professionally has made us stronger and has prepared us for what we 're doing now . " Above all , she said , it 's made them much closer . <p>
