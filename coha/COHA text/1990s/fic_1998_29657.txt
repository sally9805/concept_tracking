( CLEO ) I remember the night the helicopter landed , because I was walking on the West Side , by the river , not far south of the heliport , and my heart was breaking . It was November 8 , 2008 , and I was twenty-one . Nobody knew what was about to happen . There were a handful of reporters waiting by the landing pad , hoping to witness an interesting hoax , but that was it . And I think it 's safe to say that of all the oblivious people in the city before the dogs arrived , I was about to have my life changed more than anyone 's . It fascinates me to think about that , the last few minutes before the helicopter touched down , when those reporters were standing together , probably drinking coffee and talking to one another , and the first faint pulses of rotor blades had just begun to tremble at the edges of their hearing . Before the glaring lights came down on that little group of people and threw their shadows backward against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up their hair and tangled it over their heads . When the empty heliport by the water was still and dim , and no one had any idea . Those things are always amazingthe hour before you meet the person you 're going to marry , the last time you speak to someone before they die , even the moment before someone calls you , when they 're reaching for the telephone and you do n't know it yet . Those currents just beneath the surface of your life , separating and converging , all the time . But the only thing I was thinking as I came up to the bench near Fourteenth Street was that I was about to cry , and I wanted to be sitting down whenI did it . My boyfriend had left me . We had sublet our apartment that summer and gone to Martha 's Vineyard for a vacation , but he 'd decided not to come back , and so after living with him for two years I found myself alone in Manhattan . That had been three months earlier , but up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with registering for classes and finding a studio and trying to get everything else set up for my senior year at NYU . Living in the city had been manageable before , but that fall the practical problems of eating , paying rent , and being a student became very complicated and seemed to fill up every available minute . What had happened that evening was the last straw , somehow . John had sent me a bank card , one of mine that I 'd left with him , in the mail , just by itself in an envelope addressed to " C. Pira . " Not even " Cleo . " It was n't important ; I was n't expecting a note or anything , but I guess I 'd been having a hard time keeping myself all in one piece , and when I got that envelope I felt like something was going to come apart . So I took a walk . I did that a lot during those first months . I would make my face up and fix my hair , and put on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me look good , but not soft . I was n't planning on seeing anyone I knew , but it made me feel better . The not-looking-soft part was important because I lived in a bad neighborhood . Then , just before I went out the door , I 'd drop my little laser gun down inside my right boot . This was back when lasers first came out , before everybody had one , and I was very proud of mine . On that particular night I walked for an hour and a half . It looked like it might rain . There was a phrase from a psalm that I had found once in a Gideon Bible , which I would repeat to myself when I could n't stand to hear myself think about John anymore , and it was going through my mind as I was walking : I am poured out like water , and all my bones are out of joint : my heart is like wax ; it is melted in the midst of my bowels . I had trouble remembering the last part , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melted in the depths of my bowels , melted within my bowels ; my heart is like wax and it is melted within me . As I got near Fourteenth Street , it was suddenly as if someone had pulled the plug out of me , and everything seemed to ache , and I just could n't go any farther . I had been walking fast , and I had n't been eating or sleeping enough in the past few months . I thought I was going to cry then , so I sat down on the bench . To stave off the feeling I leaned back in a defiant way , with my feet planted far apart , and put my elbows up on the back of the bench . I turned my face to the overcast sky . It was a dangerous way to sit , but I could feel my laser pressing against the outside of my right calf , and I could hear everything around me . If a man had moved within a hundred feet of meand there was no place to hide closer than thatI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps closer . I 'd made it my business to practice when I 'd gotten the gun . So there I was , leaning back on the bench , feeling partly tough and partly so sad that I never wanted to get up again . I missed John so much . I am poured out like water , and all my bones are out of joint ; my heart is melted like wax in the depths of my bowels , in the midst of my bowels , my heart is melted within my bowels , my heart of wax , my heart is wax . I said this to myself over and over until all my other thoughts were drowned out . There was a low thrumming in the air somewhere , and I realized a helicopter was coming up the river . At that moment , lightning struck the New Jersey shore , across the water , directly in front of me . If you had been watching from the street , the bolt probably would have seemed to go right through my head . And at that exact instantor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't know how to describe it except to say that . Nothing like it had ever happened to me before . Something just burst out and flooded down , all the way to my thighs , and it was exactly like liquid wax . And right then , as I was looking up at the sky and it was cut in half by the lightning bolt and my heart split open , the helicopter entered my field of vision . You have poured me out like water and unjointed all my bones ; my heart is wax ; it 's melted in my bowels . That 's how it should have gone , I thought . The helicopter passed in front of me , sending out deep shock waves of sound that resonated in the center of my chest , as it headed for West Thirtieth Street . The pictures came out in the paper the next day . I had gotten up that morning and realized I had no coffee , so I went down to the corner deli to get some . As I stood on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to two men who were standing by the newspaper rack , holding a copy of the New York Post and saying something about it in rapid Spanish . I tried to peer over their shoulders to see what they were looking at , but I could n't get a good angle to see anything . As I was doing this , one of them glanced over his shoulder at me and smiled . " What is it ? " I asked blurrily , trying to focus on the paper , which had become visible when the man turned toward me . " A monster , " he said , holding it out and pointing to the picture at the bottom of the front page . " What do you think ? It came in a helicopter . They do n't know where it comes from . " The other man waved his hand dismissively . " It 's no monster , " he said . I looked at the photograph . The headline next to it said , " Hoax ? or Monster ' ? " The photo showed a dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door of a helicopter by a serious-looking man in a down vest . The dog seemed to stand about the same height as the man , and looked like a Malamute . The strange thing about it , besides its larger-than-average size , was the fact that it was wearing a dark-colored long jacket which looked like part of an old-fashioned military uniform , and a pair of spectacles , and that it appeared to have hands instead of front paws . In one of these gloved hands it held a cane , which was pointed at an awkward angle , probably because of the way the man was holding on to that foreleg just above the elbow . The other hand gripped the side of the helicopter doorway . The expression on the animal 's face was one of terror . Its lips were slightly parted , its ears were pointing straight backward , and its eyes were wide . " Looks like somebody put a dog in a suit , " I said , glancing up at the man who was holding the paper . He was smiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second guy said again . " Okay , " the first one replied , taking the paper back . We had gotten up to the cash register , and now the skeptical man was asking for a pack of cigarettes . " I still think it was a movie promo . I did n't say it was a monster , " the first one muttered , kind of to himself . He glanced at me again . As he put the paper down on the counter and reached into his pocket for change , the guy behind the cash register looked down at the picture of the dog and shook his head . " That 's crazy , " he commented . " ' Bye now . " " Yeah , " said the man with the paper . He glanced back at me again , and then followed his friend through the front door of the deli , out into the foggy cold . Later that morning I lay sprawled on my bed , reading the article in the Post . " MONSTER " ARRIVES IN MANHATTAN A few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a weird spectacle . The caller , who identified himself as James Wilkinson , a mechanic and helicopter pilot from Morristown , New York , said that an " incredible monster " would be arriving at the V.I.P. Heliport in Manhattan . At 11:20 p.m . Wilkinson , piloting the helicopter , and Nick Bantock , a farmer , arrived with the creature in tow . The threesome took a taxi to the Plaza Hotel , where they checked into a suite . Before boarding the taxi , Wilkinson and Bantock told reporters that the animal was exactly what it appeared to be , a big dog with hands , which walked on its hind legs with the help of a cane . They also said that it talked , though no other witnesses reported hearing it . According to the two men , the animal showed up , along with about 150 other similar " dog monsters , " in one of the pastures on Bantock 's dairy farm near Morristown , in upstate New York , on the night of November 2nd . The creature requested that Bantock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the field until " suitable arrangements " could be made . So the farmer contacted Wilkinson , who owned a helicopter , and arranged the trip . Bantock says the dog gave him several large finely cut diamonds as payment for the trip . He sold them to a local jeweler yesterday , before leaving for New York , for an undisclosed sum . New York City authorities , while skeptical of the two men 's claims , are baffled by the creature 's arrival in the city . Spokespeople at the New York City Police Department and the Mayor 's Office declined to comment on the night 's events , beyond saying that they had no information about the creature or its origins . The Sheriff 's Office of Morristown , in St. Lawrence County , was unable to investigate Bantock 's claim about the 150 other monsters pending permission from the property 's owner . There were no grounds for a search warrant at this time , a representative said . The desk clerk at the Plaza , Jill Torres , declined to comment on the hotel 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a dog . " " It does n't conflict with hotel policy , " she added . " The Plaza has always allowed dogs . " What held my attention was the photograph , the way the antique jacket and spectacles made the Malamute look as if it had just stepped out of a storybook and was surprised and frightened to find itself in the bright light of the heliport . I supposed that it was just a regular trained dog with fake hands stuck onto its front paws , but that did n't make it any less compelling or sad to me . Everyone thought it was a hoax in the morning , but it became difficult to imagine who could perpetrate such an elaborate practical joke when the rest of the dogs came to the city that afternoon . I still have the first article about it from The New York Times , because I collected nearly everything that was written about the dogs that year . ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MONSTER DOGS ' ARRIVE IN MANHATTAN Take Rooms at Plaza Hotel Three to Grant Interviews Tomorrow Four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 150 creatures that appeared to be large , trained dogs walking on their hind legs and wearing antique military jackets or long dresses , landed at LaGuardia Airport early this afternoon . The " monsters , " as some called them , were then whisked by a fleet of waiting limousines to the Plaza Hotel in midtown Manhattan . Spokespersons say the dogs plan to reside at the Plaza indefinitely . The dogs , specimens of several different large breeds including German Shepherds , Doberman Pinschers and Great Danes , stand upright at a height of about six feet and have human-like " hands " in place of front paws . Many observers claim to have heard them speak , but the animals refuse to talk to the press at present , according to their self-appointed spokesmen , James Wilkinson and Nicholas Bantock of Ellisville , N.Y . The two men say that the creatures are " monster dogs " refugees from a previously unheard-of town in northern Canada where they had lived as slaves to the humans who had endowed them with mechanical hands and powers of speech . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago and began a long journey by foot to upstate New York , where they chartered the four planes that took them to LaGuardia . Although the claims are fantastic , to say the least , police and F.B.I . agents investigating the situation have found no other explanation for the animals ' appearance at LaGuardia . " It 's just plain bizarre , that 's all , " says Police Chief Bob Whitehall of St. Lawrence County , N.Y . " I ca n't tell you a damn thing about it . " F.B.I . spokesperson Jay McLaney concurs that there is , as yet , no satisfactory explanation of where the " monster dogs " came from . The dogs ' planned arrival in New York today was announced Monday night by way of a first dog , a Malamute , who flew in by helicopter and landed at Manhattan 's V.I.P. Heliport at 11:20 P.M. The Malamute was accompanied by Nick Bantock , owner of a dairy farm , and James Wilkinson , the pilot of the craft . Mr. Wilkinson said that the dog 's name was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " suitable temporary residence " in the city for the 150 other dogs , who were waiting in one of Bantock 's pastures in St. Lawrence County . The two humans and the dog got into a cab and were driven to the Plaza , where they shared a suite of rooms Monday night . At 9:30 this morning , Mr. Bantock , Mr. Wilkinson and the dog , Klaue Lutz , arrived at Wiley 's Coins on West 47th Street , where Lutz sold approximately $70,000 worth of 19th-century German five-mark pieces to store manager Barbara Wiley . The three then returned to the hotel , where they reserved 50 rooms and suites for the other 150 monsters . Over the next few weeks , we waited for an explanation , but none was ever offered that was more plausible than the one they had given themselves . And they did give it themselves ; some of them sat for radio and TV interviews and repeated what the farmer and pilot had said about them on the first day . Most of them could speak only German , but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good command of English . They spoke quietly and carefully , as if to deemphasize their accents and the faint mechanical whir made by their voice boxes . Of course , people had theories about kings and billionaires and secret organizations that might have the resources and inclination to play such a huge , strange trick on the world , but these were nearly as unlikely as the dogs ' own story and usually not as interesting . And so for practical purposes we all began to talk about the dogs as if they were exactly what they claimed to be . Very soon after they arrived , everyone had a neighbor or acquaintance who had worked as a security guard for them , been the cameraman for one of their TV appearances , brought them takeout food , pushed an elevator button , recommended a computer , sold them a painting . The dogs loved New York and they were all over the place , buying things , seeing sights , asking questions . They had brought large amounts of jewels , old Prussian gold , and antiques with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay for movie rights to their stories , public appearances , almost anything that had to do with them . They were always surrounded by guards , but whenever the dogs had a reason to talk to someone , a museum guide or a waiter , they were endlessly curious , innocent , and delighted by everything they learned . So people began to feel that even if a practical joke was being played on the world , all the residents of New York were in on it somehow , and we began to feel a certain possessive affection for the dogs . We enjoyed playing alongwhich was not exactly the same thing as believing . There was no plausible explanation for the monster dogs , but we were certain that there eventually would be . So we went along for the time being and talked about them the way you talk about Santa Claus when there are children around . There was no point in ruining the illusion . It even seemed it would be in vaguely bad taste , and anyone who tried was gently silenced . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too deeply into the dogs ' own story . They adamantly refused to give the location of the town in Canada they had come from , and were vague when asked for details about their uprising against its human inhabitants . One had to assume that there had been bloodshed , but to most of us , who could n't fully believe in the town or its people to begin with , there seemed little point in pestering the dogs with questions they clearly did n't want to answer . The few people who did , like those who ventured into the northern wilderness in search of Rankstadt , came up empty-handed . But most people were n't very interested in cracking open the story ; we wanted to enjoy the dogs while we could . It would all be over soon enough , we thought . But months passed , and the dogs stayed with us . We got used to them . They were always on the news and everyone wanted to know where they ate and which designers they allowed to dress themalways in the dogs ' own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but with interesting embellishments ; a pared-down silhouette , maybe , and here and there a quilted vinyl belt or a ruffle of gunmetal-colored mesh . Reporters followed them everywhere , we saw and heard about them every day , and they became an accepted part of the city . I followed the stories of the dogs , too , and daydreamed during my classes at NYU that they would come to find me somehow , driving down my potholed , littered street in the gilded horse-drawn carriages hung with lanterns in which they sometimes liked to explore the city . I lived at the edge of the East Village , on a block that would never be gentrified because of the complex of housing projects next to it and the small , tough gang that owned the immediate neighborhood . My education was being paid for by a trust fund from my grandmother , but when I graduated it would be gone , and I saw myself stranded on that block , struggling to pay my rent , forever afterward . It seemed there was no other realistic way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought about things that were n't realistic , and that year the dogs were mostly what I ended up dreaming about . They were celebrities and they were rich , and their lives seemed elegant and charmed . They inhabited a New York of marble lobbies , potted palms , brass-trimmed elevators , and chandeliers , a city completely different from the one I lived in . I imagined walking from a gilded carriage , across a polished floor , and into one of those silent , well-oiled elevators and rising above the desperate future that lay in front of me . The dogs seemed to live in a world not ruled by the laws of probability , and I thought that any kind of happiness might be possible there . But of course no one except the dogs themselves knew what their lives were really like .
