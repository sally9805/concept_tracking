Vol . I On the Downs <p> UG AND HIS FRIENDS STOOD in front of the hillock , wondering how to get the bear out of the good cave . It was getting colder , and the other cave leaked . <p> Meanwhile the women and children were doing something useful like finding stuff to eat . <p> The men looked at the cave . <p> " Stick holes in same time ? " asked Ab . <p> " You seen thing ? " asked Nu . <p> " No , " said Ab . <p> Ug spread his arms wide , hairs fluttering in the cold wind . Then his son Nu jumped up on his shoulders and held his hand up as high as he could . <p> " That big ? " asked Ab , and looked at the cave again . <p> Mo was chewing one of the last leaves . They turned to him . <p> " Stick fire in face , " he said . <p> They ran around gathering up stuff . <p> Afterwards , he was known as Mo the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the snow , under the high white cliffs . <p> From the top of them you could see more land way way off , across the Big Water . Only now , where the bottoms of the cliffs used to be covered , there was much sand and rock . It went far out before the water began there . <p> " Bad feeling , " said Ug . <p> " What happening ? " asked Ab . <p> " No know , " said Ug . " Will ask Mo . " <p> On the way back to the cave , on the path , they threw their pointy sticks into one of the Big Head-horn things that was browsing in the crusted snow . It took them half the day to drag it back to the other people . <p> " Uh-oh , " said Nunu . <p> She ran back to the cave as fast as she could through the thick snow , putting her feet in the holes she 'd made coming out . <p> " Quick ! " she said . " Stoop-shouldered guys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pointy sticks and all ran to the top of the cliffs . <p> Out a ways on the mud and sand ramp that divided the two parts of the Big Water , which stretched out toward the land far away you could almost see when it was clear , men were coming . They could see their big jaws this far away , and their skins flapped around them , dark in the breeze . <p> Mo counted . <p> " We more , " he said . <p> " Get ' em , " said Ug . <p> Afterwards , they found that the big jaws belonged to the men themselves , and admired them . They were large and were out in front of the mouth . Some of the children wobbled those of the dead ones  --  yaga yaga yaga . Their teeth were all different too , the front ones not as sharp . <p> But the skins , which had flapped and fluttered around them while they were fighting , were not theirs at all . They belonged to dead animals . They could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around himself . After a while he said , " Hey ! This warm ! " <p> They rushed to grab them . <p> Mo was looking at the sandy causeway . <p> " Next time , bring more , " he said , pointing toward the far land . " They tough . Take long time die . " <p> Ug had two skins wrapped around him . He danced . <p> " Hey ! " he said . " What have supper ? " <p> Nu looked for the bug crawling in the fur of his leg , found it , pinched it to pieces . <p> It was his time to watch from the top of the tall cliffs as he had done many many times before in his youth and early manhood . Now he had children of his own . The stoop-shouldered guys big jaws never had come back . It had gotten colder , though there had been a few golden summers in there . <p> He sighed , and watched , and waited , and hummed the song about the big animal with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tenth Smart sat at the edge of the cliff on a cool summer night and looked at the quarter moon . His grandson little Nu lay beside him , looking up at the summer stars and the pictures they made  --  the Big Thing , the other Big Thing , the Ugly Thing , the Little Boy with the Snake . <p> " Which that ? " he asked . <p> " That Woman With Stick , " said Mo the tenth Smart . <p> " Over there ? " <p> There was a long pale light across the sky with a bright dot at the front . <p> " That Girl Look for Husband , " said Mo . He poked little Nu in the ribs . " Maybe marry you . She come round long time between . Mo the fourth Smart saw ; told Mo seventh Smart who saw , Mo tell me . " Little Nu rolled over and looked at the moon . <p> " Will Moon get eaten tonight ? " he asked . It had happened when he was very little and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words Mo fifth Smart : ' Quick bites come out Moon only full . ' " <p> " Forget . " <p> " Learn not forget , " said Mo the tenth Smart . <p> He looked over at the big strip of land that went between the two shallow Big Waters . As usual there was just dirt and the bushes that grew there . <p> Little Nu propped himself up on his elbows . <p> " Where come from , Grandad Mo ? " <p> " From cave , " said Mo , and laughed . <p> " No ! Where come from ? All us ? " <p> " We always here , " said Mo the tenth Smart . <p> WEENA AND OOLA lashed together the summer hut with tendons from one of the big red deer . The breeze was warm . They were setting up the hut near the break in the cliffs where the stream came through . <p> Mo the many Smart stood looking at the mouth of the stream . Some of the men and boys floated on logs , sticking things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond its mouth . There was once more Big Water all across in front of the cliffs though it was not very deep . <p> " Something bother ? " Oola asked him . <p> " Yummy fish not back . " <p> Every year big fish had shown up at the mouth of the stream , which was up the coast from where the land used to divide the Big Water . They came up in the stream . You could stick things in them , or hit them with rocks , or pick them up with your hands . They ignored you , only continuing to make eggs and sticky stuff and flopping around . They did that for most of a moon , and everybody ate and ate until they made fish puddles from their mouths . <p> " Next moon , " said Oola . <p> " No , " said Mo the many Smart . " Next moon when come while land there . " He pointed . " Land not there . They come this moon when used come before land there . All Mo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moon . " <p> " Me see day before day , " said Oola . <p> " Is where ? " <p> " There . " She pointed down the coast where the Big Water curved around into the Big Big Water . " Them come . Them swim round . Then go that way . " She waved her hand , indicating the Big Big Water . " Go round all land-world . Here next moon . " <p> " Why them do that ? " asked Mo . " Them right here ! " <p> Oola lifted her shoulders and raised her hands . <p> " Hmnm , " said Mo the many Smart . <p> A moon later , in the middle of the night , they heard flopping in the creek . They all ran down there with sticks with pointy deer horns on them and clubs and rocks . For most of that moon they ate and ate and ate . <p> Mo the many Smart lay between two big broken chalk boulders . His stomach was stretched tight under his fur . He could barely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Told so , " she said . <p> " Not forget , " said Mo . Then he made another fish puddle from his mouth . <p> After a storm , Nu the many-many ran into his hut . <p> " Stop dinner ! " he said . <p> " Make leg-of-wolf roasted tubers , " said A-la the many . <p> " Change plans , " said Nu the many-many . " Blue painted guy some jaw wash up , log thing . Jabber a lot . Ug the many-many poke him , no feel ribs . Big feast coming , yum yum eatem up . Have wolf day-add-day . " <p> " Blue paint some jaw ? " asked A-la . " Not pictured up guy some jaw ? " <p> " No . That one-back-one . This blue all over . Paint come off . White as cliff . " <p> A-la sighed . Men ! <p> Ab the many-many had troubled eyes , yellow and far-seeing . <p> He was on the cliff , looking toward the land you could barely make out . <p> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his work in the village on the downs , but his mind was not in it . <p> He came down to where the men and boys were making log-boats that would hold man-add-man for fishing . <p> " What there ? " he asked Mo the lot Smart . <p> " Big Trouble , " said Mo . <p> " How know ? Every time man come we eat , " said Ab the many-many . <p> " Goes back long way land here , " said Mo . " Land come . Stoop-shouldered guys big jaw come . More try come before land go way . Then grandfather time pictured up guys some jaw and blue painted guys some jaw wash up . No be too careful . " <p> " What we know them ? " asked Ab . <p> " Them trouble , " said Mo . <p> " Me find out ! " said Ab , jerking his thumb toward his chest fur . <p> " Smart of ages , Ab , " said Mo . " No look trouble . Trouble find anyway . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> They had watched him build a boat-log that would hold man-add-man-add-man . It had taken him day-add-day-add-day . Then he put his pointy stick , his club , hide cloak , and food into it . Then he launched it , pushed out , lined up on the big white cliff and began to paddle hard . <p> They sang him the song of safe journey , Ug the lot himself beating on the big singing log . Then they went up to the top of the cliff and watched until he was lost from sight . <p> It was almost a moon later that one of the fishermen called them all from their huts in the village on the downs , and they went to the shore beneath the cliffs . <p> It was late afternoon and there was a dot on the water . It got bigger but very slowly . <p> " It Ab , " called down the watchman from the cliffs . <p> He came to shore slowly . He paddled with only one arm . When he was close enough they saw one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that side . His right arm flopped at his side . He beached the log and hopped out , bracing himself with his left arm . ( Some things a person has to do themselves . ) His right foot was missing toe-add-toe-add-toe . <p> " Hello , Ab , " said Mo the lot Smart . <p> He was looking back across the water with his good eye . " No understand , Mo , " he said . " They kill each other over there all the time . " <p> " All the time ? " <p> " All the time . Every day . " <p> " Come . Me fix up , " said Mo . <p> " Something do first , " said Ab . He leaned down in the log-boat and made a big fire , and they all watched it burn . <p> " Mo ? " asked Ab , as cinders drifted over them on the beach . <p> " What , Ab ? " <p> " Mo . Me ever want go somewhere again , kill me with club . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Then they led him back toward the village huts . <p> Then came big nosed guys some jaw , and they brought with them the Great Big Things with Long Noses and Two Big Curved Teeth . They came in big log-boats with big square hides on trees and many many paddlers . <p> Ug the lot-many-lot said , " Get all people up down coast , jump on them . " <p> The big nosed guys some jaw lined up all together in one place with shiny pointy sticks all sticking out in one place . In front of them they put the Great Big Things with the Long Noses and the Two Big Curved Teeth . <p> " They just like old ones great-great-many-many grandfathers hunted . Only they no have hair , " said Mo , the lot-many Smart . <p> " We know how do them , " said Ug the lot-many-lot . " Get ' em . " <p> The fattest big nosed guy some jaw they chose for signal honors . <p> They whacked up the Great Big Things with the Long Noses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other villages carrying off as much as they could . <p> They found that the one-add-one-add-one big log-boats were filled with men who were fastened where they sat . They jabbered , afraid . The people broke up the things that held them down with some of the useful hard implements they found . They herded all the loosened men onto one big log-boat . <p> Ug the lot-many-lot made a shooing motion with his hands . <p> " Go way , " he said . " Go way . " <p> The men looked at him a moment . Then they began yelling and making noise and running up and down and below into the log-boat , and the big hide flopped down and they waved and yelled and ran out of sight and the paddles all started working . And the big log-boat went out of sight toward where the Big Big Water started . <p> They wrapped the fattest big nosed guy some jaw with the things which had held the paddlers to the log-boats . <p> He jabbered , but he stood straight and tall . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yum yum eatem up , " he said . <p> NU THE LOT-MANY-MANY stood on the cliff , looking back over the downs and the village . He could see a herd of the red deer browsing not very far away , and further up a flock of birds drank at the mouth of the creek . He could see women gathering seeds at the weed fields , and a couple of men were out killing hares up near the boggy place . <p> Down in the village , the gray shapes of the old boat-logs from **26;1598;TOOLONG time , which had been made into a meeting place where the people from all up and down the coast came every twelve moons to make Ug All-Boss , stood out from the other hide and mud huts . Here and there was smoke from a cooking fire . He raised his eyes and could just see smoke from the next village far up the coast . <p> He turned his eyes back to the Big Water , still dull in the early morning sun , and the far smudge of the land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a warm fine day , and Mo the lot-lot-many Smart said it was just one more moon until the yummy fish came up the creek again , and there were signs of a mild winter . <p> Later he would go down , he thought , and join the boys poking sticks into the little fish that were always in the Big Water . They would have to do until the yummy fish came in . <p> Girl Look For Husband was in the sky . Even in the late afternoon , a swatch of white with a glowing head stretched halfway across the heavens . " She really looking this time , " the people said . <p> All-Boss Ug the lot-many-lot was fixing his hut , pounding wooden pegs in with a big rock . <p> " Grandfather ! Grandfather ! " yelled little Nu the lot-many-lot , running in from the cliffs . <p> " Not have time everyone come in flaring sagittal crest , " said Ug . " What now ? " <p> " Ab many-lot-lot say big logs come again . Come quick bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and began to yell everyone out of their huts and send ones running to the other villages . <p> All the people stood on the big white cliffs . It would have been dark had not Girl Look For Husband been blazing bright as a full Moon . Everything was a sort of silver-gray twilight . <p> They looked down where lot-many boat-logs were drawn up on the beach and saw ( what Ab who had seen them before dark had said were ) weasel-eyed guys some jaw there . Many-many-lot . They all had long pointy sticks with shiny ends and shiny flat things on their hip-clothes , and some had curvy things on their backs and bags full of little sticks . <p> Ug poked Mo the lot-many-many Smart . <p> " More them than us , " said Mo . <p> " Not wait day , " said Ug . " Go get ' em ! " <p> Yelling and waving their clubs and pointy sticks , they charged down the hills . <p> ILLUSTRATION ( BLACK &; WHITE ) <p> <p> By Howard Waldrop <p> Compared with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a newcomer to our magazine  --  his first story here was " Mr. Goober 's Show " last September .
