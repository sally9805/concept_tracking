<p> IMAGINE you 're a housewife who finds a mouse in her sink , a scientist who finds a mouse in her sink , or a cat who ... " <p> Will this idea inspire these sophisticated senior girls , whose teacher , Mrs. McNatt , brought them here to my ramshackle rented farm cottage by the briny Patuxent River " to experience an intensive creative seminar with a live writer " ? <p> " Try writing from the first person viewpoint , " I suggest , struggling to feel alive after a fortnight in the city . " Then do the whole thing over in the third . See what works best . Experiment with present tense , past tense , historical present , historical past , historical mouse , mouse as history ... " <p> Reaching the place just before the class , I 'd rushed to scrub , sweep , arrange 12 chairs around the table . I 'm not a tidy housekeeper ; I would be if I did n't have all these half-finished manuscripts to finish , and a number of other excuses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spider webs : They might inspire a poem . <p> Whoever left this sink dirty ... ! <p> I lifted the strainer to dump the contents into the trash . Suddenly whatever it was , furry under my fingertips , moved . A mouse , curled around the steep knob . Pink lettuce ears twitched and his tail wiggled like a section of old rubber band . I rushed the strainer outside . Whisked through the air , as on a ferris wheel , he was too scared to flee . I placed him near the compost heap : at least he 'll get a good meal . And stay outdoors . <p> With autumn , our cats return to the city , mice move indoors . I 've brought Telemachus , our big beige/gray/black tabby , for company . Busy revisiting old haunts beyond the garden , Telemachus was unaware of the mouse . <p> Seldom am I here alone at night : usually family and friends fill every bed , and even the creakiest couches . <p> The girls arrived , wiped out after their two-hour drive from Baltimore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dirt road " from Mrs. McNatt 's house . Barely a mile , all downhill . I 'd forgotten how melodramatic ( we ) girls can be at 16 . Now they are famished , so we quickly improvise lunch . <p> Telemachus smells cheese sandwiches grilling and sashays in . <p> " Such beautiful yellow-green eyes ! " <p> " I adore his white booties . " <p> The girls slip him corners of provolone . <p> " You could also write a story , " I suggest , " from the viewpoint of the mouse who discovers a cat in her sink . " <p> The girls are n't interested in mice . They live in modern houses . Mrs. McNatt has no mice in her house up the hill . <p> " This is an old farmhouse , " I explain . " The foundations may date from 1600 . Full of history , which we can invent since I 'm not sure of it , and mice , of which I am certain . " <p> Over grilled cheeses , shared by Telemachus whose presence may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invention versus " reality , " plot , dialogue , cliches , excess adverbs . We try improvisations . They ask me how I write . I show them my manuscripts : rewritten 20 times , still changing . Struggling to spark their own ideas , I read two narrative poems , unrhymed so the girls do n't feel intimidated by the notion they have to write rhyming poems , or even poems at all . <p> Mrs. McNatt is chewing her pencil ; she looks ready to write , but her students are not . <p> Matilda , a blonde in white jogging suit and sandals , is worrying her curls . I wonder if she 'll be up to a hike through the marshes . <p> " Of course201 , " She yawns . " Such a gorgeous day . " <p> " Is n't it , " I yawn back . " But when you get down to writing , try to get across the concept of ' gorgeous ' without overused adjectives201 . However , first thing in a new place , I want to explore . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us set off through the fields toward the dock : We might see crabs , the last ospreys , the first geese . Anytime : gulls . <p> I want them to observe with the eye of an artist , or photographer , or scientist ... Normally I do n't think about doing so myself , do n't premeditate my own writing , ca n't say how " creativity " happens201 . I prefer mucking around old boats and crabpots and tramping meadows to writing ... A FIELD trip , but these girls are n't used to muddy fields . Nor bushwhacking through underbrush , though they 've seen it done on television . Nor are some of them dressed for it : Though most wear jeans , some of their shoes are going to be sorely tested even as we follow deer paths through the soybean field . Telemachus trots among us , but when the going gets rough , the girls take turns carrying him . <p> Then I ask : " Want to take the easy way or the interesting route ? " <p> The wary ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ join me in slogging through the marsh along the shore . Telemachus accompanies us , but gets stymied by the incoming tide . He meows . We carry him to the cove where a broken oyster boat wallows in waves . Good place to crab . <p> The girls are enthusiastic about crabbing , but refrain from experiencing bait . I tie it to strings201 . Their chatter about yesterday 's TV spectacular scares off whatever crabs are there . <p> We change direction to look for the heron who hides by the pond hidden in the grove beyond the cornfield . <p> " Imagine , " Susie says , " getting lost among these rows of identical cornstalks ! " <p> We sort of do , among the maze and walls of stalks turning dry and beige , rattling like skeletons . At the edges , blackberry briars reach out to nab our ankles . <p> It 's evident writing is a rough business . <p> Finally we emerge on the dirt road and , picking off burrs , head home for cider . <p> " And some serious writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I suggest . " Something fantastic . Or ostensibly ordinary . Main thing : write . But in your first draft , do n't worry about spelling , grammar , penmanship . You are n't writing to please your teacher now . You can share your work , but you do n't have to . <p> For now , forget the banalities of daily life . Or : write what you know201 . Meanwhile , check out this house , full of creaks and cobwebs , and everyone find a different nook for writing ... " <p> They fan out to all the corners . You need solitude to write , but some girls insist on clumping and chattering . Abigail discovers the attic with a hundred-year-old perambulator . Sandra discovers the trapdoor to the cellar , shines the flashlight on the mud floor and walls of flat stones , flushes a woodchuck . Both are terrified , retreat . <p> " Where do those stairs go ? " Matilda calls from the cellar depths . <p> " Other stairs ? " Puzzled , I hurry down . <p> Matilda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They lead to the dusty ceiling , then stop . But once upon a time ... <p> Brushing the dust from her white jogging suit , Matilda decides to write on the sun porch . <p> " I 'm at a loss for a subject , " complains Jocelyn . " I want to become a biologist , not a poet . " <p> " Here ... , " I hand her the last marigold . <p> An hour later , they read aloud each other 's drafts . Television plots or images figure in most stories , though Bettina 's memoir describes adventures in Buenos Aires , Matilda 's her house in Baltimore . Some are predictable love poems . Jocelyn has described a marigold : precisely , scientifically , unexpectedly poetically . <p> Surprisingly , neither seascape nor farmhouse have inspired any of the girls . Nor has the hapless mouse . <p> But they are eager to resume the workshop tomorrow . Now they hike up the long dirt road to Mrs. McNatt 's house . They 'll spread sleeping bags across her floors , whisper and giggle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wonder if they will also write . <p> I remain in the chilling farmhouse , a mile from any other . The walls rustle . I shiver . Telemachus sleeps . I light the fire , pile Chaliapin records on the Victrola , pay banal bills , stare at my neglected manuscripts . Chaliapin 's basso profundo fills every cranny of the house . <p> Suddenly Telemachus bounds across the room . A mouse vanishes under baseboards . <p> All evening mice skitter forth on invisible skates , roll across the floor like walnuts . All evening Telemachus leaps in hot or cold pursuit . <p> He seizes a mouse in his teeth and I leap to pursue the pursuer . Surprised , he drops the mouse . Unharmed , it dashes away . He catches another , drops it . One mouse ducks under his belly , hides by his left hind paw . Both mouse and cat seem confused by their juxtaposition . Telemachus shifts . The mouse skims under my chair , as if I , Earth Mother , could protect him . <p> When I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night , release them outside . Unless the owl is more powerful tonight , they may rediscover their summer burrows . More likely , by morning they 'll rediscover the house . This is their territory . We are intruders . Are mice my territory ? <p> Let the girls write about their own territories201 . I curl up by the fire . Telemachus purrs , accompanying Chaliapin . When the records stop , we hear geese overhead , squeaks within walls , footsteps on the second staircase , my pencil scratching .
