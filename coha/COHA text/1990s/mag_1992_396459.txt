When it comes to live baits for bass , why is it that worms , minnows and frogs seem to get all the glory , when a variety of less famous forage do just as well at getting largemouths to lunch ? A monarch butterfly was flitting along the sea wall in the small canal when , suddenly , a two-pound largemouth shot skyward , just missing its hovering target . My next cast placed the small jerkbait right on the dimpled surface where the bass had returned to water . One twitch was all that was necessary . The largemouth mistook my plug for " forage flak " and exploded on it . I landed the small fish and quickly released it . I 'm sure that the bass did n't really examine the butterfly or the plug before going airborne after each . They were just two instinctive strikes at anything that moved . The event did emphasize one interesting fact , however : Bass will eat or try to eat the craziest things ! I once found a thrashing five-pound largemouth trying to swallow a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the pickerel 's snout had worked through its assailant 's gills . The two fish were locked in a life-threatening situation , wallowing on the surface of the lake until I came along and freed them from their quite precarious predicament . Pretty much anything that swims in  --  or hovers or crawls just above  --  the same water that the largemouth inhabits is fair game for the aggressive bass . Both biologists and bass anglers examining bass stomachs have found snakes , frogs , ducklings and a myriad of other fish species therein . Largemouth bass eat muskies , catfish , other bass and even the occasional small bird perched on a cattail or reed above the water . Larry Lazoen , a guide friend from Port Charlotte , Florida , once came across a peculiar type of foraging activity on Blue Cypress Lake in the east-central part of the state . The beautiful lake is surrounded by a perimeter of cypress trees , many of which lie several hundred years from the swampy shoreline . Lazoen noticed numerous small lizards venturing out on cypress knees at the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cypress knees near the water , a bass would strike at them , " said the guide . " I could usually toss my topwater bait toward that swirl and catch the fish . " On that day the guide and his partner caught at least six largemouths that had first struck at the chameleons playing around on the cypress trunks . The four to six-inch lizards apparently had swum out to the trees and survived that precarious situation . Moving to the water 's edge on a cypress knee have tried to use chameleons as bait , but the lizards have to be fished on the water 's surface because they ca n't breathe below it . Water dogs , or salamanders , on the other hand , are common submergent forage and bass baits . Many anglers have used the ugly creatures to catch trophy bass . Some unusual live forage not commonly known as bass food can be fished effectively as bait . For example , the saltwater mullet is a fairly hardy species that can survive in slightly brackish water and even fresh water  --  for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bait is an excellent trophy largemouth attractor that many old-time anglers have kept secret for years . An eight-inch mullet is an ideal size for a big bass . A mess of the baitfish can usually be rounded up with a cast net along coastal sloughs , bay inlets and flats . They are present all along the Gulf Coast and northward along the Atlantic to the Carolinas . Anglers who are very tightlipped about using live mullets employ the bait as they would a large shiner  --  by hooking the forage through the lips or through the back just behind the dorsal fin . Most anglers use heavy line  --  20-pound test or so  --  when fishing near dense cover in most Southern waters . The mullet is able to tolerate fresh water while on the hook , at least as long as it will normally last near a big bass . Another great largemouth bass bait that inhabits tidewater rivers adjacent to the country 's coastal stretches is the saltwater shrimp . Few anglers realize the potential and effectiveness of such a bait . While living in Jacksonville , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on numerous occasions to amass big catches of largemouths . Most of our fishing took place 20 to 40 miles upstream from the St. Johns River 's entrance at Mayport , well away from the saltwater portion of the river . " Shrimp are beginning their spawning runs to brackish water , " a Florida native told me on my first trip to try out the offering . " We 'll use the bait in the quiet-water eddies off the river and under the docks . " The June day was sunny and hot as we launched his bass boat near Julington Creek . Within a few minutes , we were approaching a wooded pier with cane poles in hand . My partner had employed the poles before for accurately placing the baits along the piers . It had been many years since I had used such tackle , but I must say , the poles were a fun way to fish the shrimp around and under the docks . We rigged our live shrimp beneath floats and allowed them to drift back into the pilings on the moving tide . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the dark reaches under the wooded canopy , which is necessary for maximum action . Our lively baits only lasted one drift under the first dock . Largemouths weighing two pounds each were soon cavorting at the ends of our 12-foot lengths of 20-pound test . The bright sun helped keep the bass positioned under the dock that day as we caught about 18 largemouths in a little more than four hours . The action was exciting at times , and we even lost a couple of trophy bass to the barnacle-clad pilings . I 've had many similar experiences since then using the same bait and conventional tackle . When accompanied by a few split shot or a small rubbercore sinker , shrimp are also effective bass catchers along river shorelines . The baits are usually cast to the bank and retrieved back along the drop that often lies just off the shoreline cover in most tidal-influenced waters . Another productive way to fish with shrimp is to troll them along the drops . To prevent the line from twisting , hook the shrimp through its mouth and out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrimp are available at many bait stores . If they are properly cared for , shrimp will last for a couple of days . Use a Styrofoam bucket , and place a rag dunked in salt water over the bait . Add ice cubes occasionally , and the shrimp will stay fresh and lively . Tidal estuaries are prime places for utilizing shrimp , and anywhere that shrimp migrate to freshwater spawning areas are good spots to use them for largemouths . The spawning run normally occurs from the early summer to the early fall , depending on the area . I 've used shrimp effectively during September in Florida 's Panhandle creeks off the Apalachicola River watershed along the state 's peninsula , on the Nassau River in northeastern Florida and in some Georgia rivers . Saltwater estuaries along the Gulf of Mexico and up the southern Atlantic are also teeming with bass forage such as crabs , snails and salamanders . Both freshwater and saltwater crabs no more than two inches in diameter make excellent baits in waters where they exist naturally . Florida 's St. Johns River , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , about 100 miles from its entrance into the ocean . In Jacksonville , about 25 miles from the mouth of the river , the crabs hanging around the barnacle-clad pilings are of the saltwater variety . A No. 4/0 hook run through the back of the crab 's shell or into the " tendon " where the claw arm meets the body is the way to rig this bait . Crabs should be fished on the bottom with a rubbercore sinker placed 12 to 18 inches above the offering . Crabs , like crayfish , must be kept moving because they have a tendency to crawl beneath objects to hide . Salamanders , which live in both brackish and fresh waters , are not the usual live bait tossed to bass , but they are effective . Salamanders , commonly known as water dogs , spring lizards and mud puppies , are a clan comprised of dozens of species . Some spend their entire lives underwater , whereas others are seldom wet . They come in a variety of shapes , sizes and colors . Some are dark and slender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Almost all of the funny-looking species attract bass , but one of the most productive is the larval salamander . It is recognized by irregular yellowish-brown spots over a base color of dark brown . Storage is easy : A cool ice chest will keep salamanders lively for up to six months with periodic water changes ( cold temperatures slow down the water dog 's metabolism ) . Fill the cooler with eight inches of stream water and a few rocks . Salamanders are a durable bait , and their soft , meaty skin makes them very palatable to bass . Although salamanders grow to 15 inches or more , eight to 10-inch baits are preferred by most trophy bass specialists . Because a few commercial ventures sprang up about 10 years ago , obtaining salamanders is not too difficult . Some bait shops even stock them , or you can find them listed for sale in the back of many outdoor magazines . A sharp No. 3/0 or No. 4/0 weedless hook with a one-quarter-ounce rubbercore sinker is normally used to rig a water dog . The bait can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or through the tail . Regardless of the hooking method , an easy lob cast will keep the bait on and in healthy condition . I 've found water dogs to be fun to fish and easier to handle than other " oddball " baits . Simply flip them out along edges of deep weed lines , underwater rock ledges , sunken islands and brush piles or under docks or over grassy spawning flats . I 've found that working salamanders more slowly than you would work a plastic worm is best . Let the bait make the effort to entice the strike . When a bass hits , more often than not it will run with the water dog before swallowing it . Usually there will be ample time to set the hook . Similar baits  --  but without the legs  --  are catfish . Of course , these baits are a bit more difficult to handle than salamanders , but this is no reason to overlook them . Perhaps one reason why catfish are often neglected is because anglers do n't even consider them a bass forage . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cove off the main body of a small Southern lake when we noticed that the shallows would erupt periodically with feeding bass . The largemouths were actively foraging , but we could n't generate a strike . We decided to inspect the shallow shelf even if it meant spooking our quarry . As we approached the shore , we discovered small dark-brown fish moving in and out from the bank in huge schools . Little bullhead catfish about one inch long were being attacked by the bass hanging just off the shoreline . We did n't have live catfish bait or artificial lures that resembled them that spring day , so we were unsuccessful in our efforts to boat any of those bass . On another day in our farthest Western state , Hawaii , I did have along live catfish , and the results were different . A prime live bait for largemouths there is what residents call Chinese catfish . The air-breathing catfish is technically a " puntat , " which is a relative of the infamous walking catfish currently " footloose " in Florida . In Hawaii , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on bass . On my first trip to the beautiful island of Oahu , a lakeside resident revealed to me the effectiveness of the catfish . The avid angler lived on Wilson Reservoir , Hawaii 's principal public bass water , and had a convenient bait-holding pond near his back door . The small in-ground pond contained hundreds of crayfish and a like amount of four to five-inch puntats . Many local anglers net their own catfish and store the hardy bait in such holding ponds until needed . We netted several of the catfish and headed out in one of my friend 's small boats . We anchored several yards offshore and over a point that extended to the deep stream channel . My partner reached into his bucket of bait , grabbed a lively three-inch catfish and threaded the No. 2 hook through its lips . The bait , without benefit of weight , was tossed toward the point and stream bed intersection and allowed to settle into 15 feet of water . A minute went by , then two . My friend reached for his spinning rig and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute elapsed before the rod tip twitched . He then quickly dropped the tip , waited for the bass to stretch out the slack , and then set the hook hard into a battling largemouth . The two-pounder was soon swimming away from the angler 's released thumb lock . Five hours later , we had caught and released another dozen bass , including a four-pounder , all taken using catfish . As with any bait , anglers should be aware of any restrictions regarding the baits ' obtainment , importation or use on hook and line . Some states have regulations on types of allowable baits ; others allow anglers to use certain species only if they were caught by the angler . Consult regulations or local fish and game agencies before using any unusual baits . Another unique bait used in the Southern region of the United States is the live eel , and though this bait is a little more difficult to handle , it is usually worth the trouble . As a matter of fact , Florida 's second-largest bass ever and the previous state record was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That largemouth of 19 pounds fell for a live American eel , and many big bass today are caught on the same . A few bait shops in Florida and surrounding states carry the snakelike forage , and most avid anglers in these states have caught them on rod and reel . American eels , found all along the Atlantic Ocean , move into coastal rivers en masse while still youngsters . The female eels swim far up the waterways and stay in fresh water for anywhere from five to 20 years until they mature . Then they descend to meet the males in the brackish waters and move offshore to spawn . Though in some Southeastern states eels may be among the most common forage , as a bait they are still overlooked . Eight-inch eels are an ideal size for most largemouths . The hardy baits can be hooked through the nose , and they 'll stay lively all day , even after catching three or four big bass . You can cast and retrieve the baits for several hours without them dying . The best rig is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 20-pound-test line . For fishing deep drop-offs , add a slip sinker in front of the bait . Like shiners , eels get nervous around bass , and the resulting line movement is a telltale sign to be prepared to set the hook . Eels will twist and squirm and sometimes ball up the line . Hooking them immediately behind the head just under the skin may prevent some of these very same entanglements . In addition to the baits mentioned previously , most " native " freshwater fish may be used as live bait by bass anglers  --  though there are exceptions . Forage that may be illegal in some states are various species of gamefish  --  including other varieties of black bass  --  goldfish and carp . Though a lot of money is spent on live bait each year , many types can be obtained right from the water being fished . Those native baits are often the best bet for enticing a bass . Sportfish , such as crappies , bluegills and other panfish , are sometimes illegal to use as bait , so it is wise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such fare is excellent enticement for largemouths . If anglers intend to use sportfish as bait , they must usually catch them on hook and line , although where legal , some areas can yield productive seine hauls of panfish and other bass forage . Pickerel , for example , may be used as bait in Florida on rod and reel , but only by anglers who catch the bait themselves . Though most anglers are satisfied with the effectiveness of shiner minnows or crayfish , other unique baits can bring additional excitement and interest to bass fishing . In fact , trying some outlandish live bait may result in the best bass fishing you 've ever had ! MULLETS One of bassing 's best-kept live-bait secrets is the saltwater mullet . Mullets are often taken with cast nets , and eight-inch specimens are the ideal size for big largemouths . Live mullets are most commonly hooked the way large shiners are  --  either up through the lips or through the back just behind the dorsal fin . Stout line  --  around 20-pound test  --  is recommended in heavy cover . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largemouths . These hardy baits can remain active for several hours ' worth of casting , retrieving and catching bass . Eels are often used on 15 to 20-pound test , and to prevent tangles , are rigged with a No. 4/0 or No. 5/0 hook just behind the head under the skin . Another way to hook them is through the nose . SHRIMP Live shrimp are productive when allowed to drift beneath docks or into quiet eddies , or when they 're retrieved or trolled along drops near river shorelines . When drifting shrimp , it 's common to rig them beneath a float , hooking them through the tail . When trolling , hooking a shrimp through its mouth and out the top of its head will prevent line twist . BLUEGILLS Where legal , bluegills and other sportfish are often used for bass . These baits must usually be caught on hook and line , though the use of seines is sometimes allowed . Bluegills , similar to mullets , are often hooked in the manner that large shiners are  --  up through the lips . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's legal to use them as bait . CRABS Where they occur naturally , crabs make excellent bass attractants . They should be no more than two inches in diameter and should be kept moving when fished . To rig a crab , run a No. 4/0 hook through the back of its shell or through the " tendon " where its claw arm meets its body . Bottomfish crabs using a rubbercore sinker placed 12 to 18 inches above the bait . SALAMANDERS Salamanders come in many shapes , sizes and colors ; and not only do bass like them , but they are also fun to fish , durable and will keep for up to six mouths in storage . Salamanders are hooked with a No. 3/0 or No. 4/0 weedless hook through the lips , the nostrils or the tail . A quarter-ounce rubbercore sinker will get the bait to the bottom quicker and aid in its control . <p>
