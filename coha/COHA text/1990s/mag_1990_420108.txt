Section : SOCIETY ENVIRONMENT With the memory of Yellowstone still fresh , the Park Service rushed to snuff the fires of Yosemite <p> For Jerry Sonnert from Durham , N.C. , it was the trip of a lifetime : a I month of camping across the United States culminating in a visit to Yosemite National Park , one of the most beautiful valleys on the planet . But last week Sonnert and his family were n't lounging in verdant meadows . Instead they were sleeping in their car , nearly 16 miles from the park boundary , watching an eerie orange glow in the eastern night sky . Just six weeks short of its 100th birthday , Yosemite was on fire and for the first time in its history all visitors were evacuated . Parts of the park reopened by the weekend , but too late for the Sonnerts , who headed home . " This is n't my idea of a fun vacation , watching a park burn , " groused son Patrick , 14 . " Dad says think of it as witnessing history . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is going on ? " <p> Well , basically , natural history  --  with perhaps a bit of modern politics . The lightning-spawned Yosemite fires came just two summers after the 1988 Yellowstone inferno , which heaped a load of criticism upon the National Park Service . In Yellowstone , fires were initially allowed to burn  --  a practice known as prescribed burning  --  in order to clear underbrush . But the blazes got out of control and ultimately seared 720,000 acres over five months . In Yosemite , by contrast , authorities immediately sent in more than 3,000 firefighters and brought three separate fires under control in only one week ( map ) . The loss was still significant  --  about 22,000 acres burned , including 67 buildings in the small town of Foresta  --  but altogether small in comparison to Yellowstone . By the time the smoke cleared at the weekend , park officials had even begun to salute one another for their modest victory . Then , just as quickly , critics began to question the firefighting plan and , ultimately , the development of the entire park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America 's national parks for years to come . Yosemite superintendent Michael Finley insists it took no urging from higher-ups in Washington for him to order a full-scale assault on the Yosemite blazes . This time , prescribed burning was more than impolitic  --  it was clearly impractical . In principle , letting fires burn reduces the fuel supply of grass , shrubs and fallen wood on the forest floor . Small fires stay on the ground and do n't kill trees ; when the fuel supply becomes too overgrown , flames can engulf the forest . Indians once regularly torched Yosemite 's forests to keep them healthy . But by this summer , California was in its fourth year of drought , and many trees were extraordinarily dry . The result , says one firefighter on the front lines , was that fires " roared up the canyon walls and came ripping over the top like wild animals . " In some areas the fire reached 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit  --  hot enough to shatter granite boulders . " There is no such thing as let burn ' in this situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As the park reopens this week , visitors will be greeted by blackened and sometimes devastated forests along the approach roads . On some stretches , metal traffic signs have melted and the stripes on the road have been vaporized . The seven-mile-long box-shaped Yosemite Valley , with its picture-postcard views of El Capitan and Half Dome , remains untouched , as does a nearby grove of giant sequoias . So why did the Park Service evacuate more than 10,000 visitors , many of whom had made their reservations a full year in advance ? Superintendent Finley says there was no choice ; the steep-walled valley , which dead-ends on the east , could have trapped its inhabitants , and there was only a three-day supply of food in the park . In addition , the normal August traffic jams in the valley , sometimes reminiscent of Los Angeles gridlock , might have hindered emergency vehicles . <p> The fire and subsequent park closure spiked what rangers expected would be the most crowded weekend in the park 's history . Instead , the smoky valley was deserted except for residents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costly : at least $50,000 a day in lost Park Service revenue , and several hundred thousand dollars a day for concessionaire Yosemite Park and Curry Co. , which runs the hotels , restaurants and shops . <p> The forest , with the exception of some very old and large trees , will regenerate quickly  --  although it could take as long as 300 years before the worst-burnt areas return to their prefire majesty . Yellowstone visitors this summer are often surprised by how quickly burned areas have grown new dustings of green . And there are even some unexpected benefits . Following a fire , wildflowers bloom in unusual profusion for a decade or more ; a number of plants and trees actually need fire to propagate their seeds . " This is a once-every-300-years event where nature decides she 's going to start over again , " says Kaunert . " For some it will be painful to see . But you have to remember we are glimpsing a brief moment in the natural history of this valley . " <p> The Yosemite decision to fight fire immediately does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Park Service temporarily banned the technique after the Yellowstone blaze . Now two scientific panels have concluded that some kind of natural-burn policy is appropriate for maintaining healthy forests  --  although such controlled burns are usually allowed only at higher elevations and when there is sufficient humidity to keep a damper on the blaze . By last week another California fire in high , isolated terrain in Sequoia National Park had been allowed to burn for five weeks . <p> Embattled wilderness : But in heavily used parks , smoldering fires are n't exactly pleasing . Some critics charge that the concessionaires who run businesses within the parks quietly pressure the Park Service to extinguish fires when the smoke obscures views and annoys tourists . The Park Service , says Alfred Runte , a former ranger and author of " Yosemite : The Embattled Wilderness , " " is torn between what the scientists tell it and what the concessionaires and developers tell it . If the underbrush in Yosemite had been reduced gradually over the last 100 years with controlled burning , nobody would have noticed these fires . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is facing as it passes the century mark . " Fire policy , " says Runte , " is just one example of how when you get an infrastructure into a park , it perpetuates itself . Development takes on a life of its own , serving the self-interest of the bureaucracy and concessionaires . " Yosemite already includes urban experiences ranging from traffic jams and a pizza parlor to a sweat-shirt emporium and a 23-bed jail ( housing five to seven prisoners every summer night ) . <p> Conservationists have tried to limit people in the park . A 1980 Park Service plan included suggestions as radical as excluding cars from the valley , shuttling all visitors by bus and retrieving some natural areas from development . But over the last decade little has changed within the park except for an increase in crowds and shopping opportunities . Yosemite now has 3.5 million visitors a year  --  700,000 in August alone . Even the ranger in charge of the centenary celebration this October is keeping a low profile . " We do n't really need to encourage more people to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with trees : Environmentalists and superintendent Finley blame the slow progress of the decade-old improvement plan on a lack of funding . Thus Yosemite watchers were shocked by the revelation this spring that , out of $84.7 million in Yosemite revenue in 1989 , Yosemite 's sole concessionaire , the Curry Co. ( an arm of entertainment giant MCA ) , paid the government only $635,772 in franchise fees . Curry Co. executives admit they expect to pay more for their lucrative concession when the contract with the Park Service comes up for renewal in 1993 . <p> But Curry officials are adamant about refuting another common criticism : that through commercialization they are turning Yosemite into a Disneyland with trees . Company planners respond that the changes in the park , which would make it more a resort than a national park , are simply what the public demands . Example : reservations for Yosemite 's venerable but rustic tent cabins  --  canvas shells set up each year on permanent concrete pads  --  are waning , due to the lack of indoor plumbing . " American travelers , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " want toilets . " The Curry Co. ' s proposal : tear down the tent cabins and build additional motellike units in their place . " It 's a difficult question , " Jensen adds . " When are you keeping up with demand and when are you pushing too hard ? " <p> But Jensen may be right . Surveys indicate that more than 50 percent of Yosemite visitors never travel more than 100 yards from their autos or tour buses . Yosemite 's cocktail lounges , complete with widescreen sports TV , have never been more popular , while back-country use by hikers and backpackers is actually dropping . This spring , even as the valley floor was jammed with visitors , a 20-minute walk into the higher country produced immediate solitude . Indeed , the phenomenon of a glitzed-up amusement-park Yosemite may say more about the changing recreational tastes of the American public than about appropriate park management . There 's no doubt that in time Yosemite Valley will recover from last week 's fires .
