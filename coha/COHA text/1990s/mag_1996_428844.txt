Many problems confound our understanding of how the Sun works . But powerful new instruments observing the Sun night and day , from its unseen depths to its million-degree atmosphere , are providing new clues to long-standing mysteries .

They were smooth spheres of gas governed by simple laws of gravity , temperature , and pressure . The hydrogen fusion reactions powering most of them were worked out in 1939 . Detailed models of stellar interiors followed in the 1950s and 1960s The centers of stars , astronomy textbooks have long declared , are better known than the center of the Earth . As we 've examined the Sun more closely , however , it has turned out to be a bewildering turmoil of complex phenomena - a churning , quivering , ever-changing body that shows unexpected features and behavior at every scale . But now , after creating ever more problems for solar physicists , the Sun may soon yield up many of its secrets . Major new instruments in space , on the ground , and beneath the Earth 's surface are poised to clarify several crucial solar mysteries . Such instruments have extended our gaze from the visible solar disk deep into the Sun 's interior and out through its tenuous atmosphere . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly from the nuclear-fusion reactor of the solar core . Surface oscillations , the signature of ultralow-frequency sounds trapped within the Sun , probe the rest of the solar interior . The Sun 's outer atmosphere is routinely imaged by ultraviolet and X-ray telescopes lofted above the Earth 's obscuring air . Our new views of these domains have raised many questions . They include the enigmatic solar-neutrino problem , the Sun 's strangely complex internal rotation , a crisis in the dynamo theory for generating the Sun 's magnetic phenomena , unexplained explosions in the solar atmosphere , and the unknown mechanisms that heat the million-degree corona and accelerate the solar wind . This is a decisive time for solar physics A powerful new solar-neutrino detector , Superkamiokande in Japan , began taking data on April 1st , and the much-anticipated Sudbury , Ontario , neutrino observatory will begin operation in early 1997 . The Solar and Heliospheric Observatory , or SOHO , a $1 billion spacecraft operated jointly by the European Space Agency and NASA , was launched on December 2 , 1995 , and is now observing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solar observatory ever built , will provide at least a 22-year span of coordinated studies extending from the center of the Sun nearly to the Earth . And ground-based telescopes in the Global Oscillation Network Group , or GONG , have just begun observing solar oscillations around the clock . In this article I will describe what we are learning about the Sun 's innermost and outermost regions . Next month 's installment will cover helioseismology the study of solar oscillations , and what they tell us about the regions in between . THE SOLAR NEUTRINO PROBLEM The Sun is immense ; it has 109 times the diameter of Earth and 333,000 times the mass . At its center the solar gas is tremendously compressed by the weight of the material above . The temperature is 15.6 million degrees Kelvin and the gas density is 151 grams per cubic centimeter , more than 13 times the density of lead . This is hot and dense enough for nuclear fusion reactions to occur  --  albeit slowly . The very fastest moving hydrogen nuclei , or protons , occasionally collide head on and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chain of events that ends up creating helium-4 and generating the Sun 's heat . Outside the solar core , where the overlying weight and compression are less , the gas is cooler and thinner , and nuclear reactions can not occur . The reactions in the Sun 's central furnace create prodigious quantities of neutrinos . These tiny particles travel at the speed of light almost unimpeded through the Sun , the Earth , and nearly any amount of ordinary matter as though it were not there at all . Massive neutrino detectors , tanks of fluid buried deep underground so that only neutrinos will reach them , have managed to catch and count just a few of the estimated 60 billion solar neutrinos that pass through each cubic centimeter of the Earth each second . These captured neutrinos have opened a window directly onto the Sun 's energy-generating core .

Delaboudiniere. // By finding solar neutrinos in roughly the predicted numbers , four pioneering neutrino detectors have now demonstrated that the Sun is indeed heated by hydrogen fusion . However , for almost 30 years these experiments have been finding only one-third to one-half the number of neutrinos that theory says they should , a discrepancy known as the solar-neutrino problem . There are two possible explanations . Either we do n't really know how the Sun and stars create their energy , or we do n't understand neutrinos . If the center of the Sun were just 1 million degrees cooler , nuclear reactions would slow down and produce fewer neutrinos , resolving the problem . However , this situation would have to be only temporary . Heat generated at the Sun 's core takes about 170,000 years to work its way to the surface . If the nuclear reactions remained weak for anywhere near this time , the Sun would cool off . Yet it seems no such dimmings have occurred throughout geologic history . In any case , after fine-tuning their models of the solar interior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made to go away so easily . According to John Bahcall of the Institute of Advanced Study at Princeton , the relative numbers of solar neutrinos detected at various energies can not be reconciled with any reasonable solar model . This suggests , he says , that " new physics is required to explain the observations . " Perhaps the neutrinos have an identity crisis on their way to us from the center of the Sun . Neutrinos come in three varieties , associated with the electron , the muon , and the tau particle . The electron neutrino is the type generated in the Sun 's core and is the only type that solarneutrino detectors can respond to as of now . Could some of the electron neutrinos be switching to another type during their 8 1/3-minute journey from the center of the Sun to Earth , thereby escaping detection ? One appealing idea is that neutrinos naturally " oscillate " between all three states . This would neatly account for why we find only about a third of the expected numbers . In one version , the switchover is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through it . Any such behavior would have profound implications for particle physics . In order to change states , a neutrino must have at least a tiny amount of substance , or rest mass . However , neutrinos are assumed to be completely massless in the present theory uniting the electromagnetic force with the " weak " force that governs neutrino interactions with other particles . The solar-neutrino results therefore may require a new physics of the sort that Bahcall implies , superseding the current electroweak model . If the oscillations tell us the actual neutrino mass , as they should if well observed , this in turn could specify the exact energy at which all the forces of nature become interchangeable in a Grand Unified Theory . NEW NEUTRINO DETECTORS Experiments currently or soon to be under way should settle the question of whether some neutrinos switch identities en route to Earth . These underground detectors include the Japanese Superkamiokande that began catching neutrinos last April , and the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory in Canada now nearing completion .

The central flask , made of clear acrylic plastic , will contain 1,000 tons of heavy water so that all three " flavors " of neutrinos can be detected - if they indeed arrive from the Sun . The flask will be surrounded by 10,000 photomultipliers . More than a mile of rock above the detector will block cosmic rays , and 7,000 tons of ordinary water surrounding the flask will block background radiation from the rock .

Occasionally a passing neutrino knocks a high-speed electron off of a water molecule . The electron moves through the water faster than light travels in water , generating an electromagnetic shock wave and a light cone of so-called Cherenkov radiation , somewhat in the manner a supersonic aircraft creates a sonic boom . Thousands of light detectors lining the water tank measure the axis of the light cone , which tells the direction of the incoming neutrino . Superkamiokande will provide a 30fold increase in the observed rate of neutrino-electron collisions . The neutrinos ' energy spectrum may be measured via the energies of the scattered electrons . A distortion in the energy spectrum could reveal the way neutrinos transform from one type to another - if they do . The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory , or SNO , is buried 2,070 meters ( 6,800 feet ) underground in a working nickel mine near Sudbury , Ontario . The detector is a huge , spherical vat holding 1,000 tons of heavy water , a form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atom whose nucleus consists of a proton and a neutron ) . The vat of heavy water is surrounded by a 7,000-ton jacket of ordinary water that shields it from weak natural radiation in the underground environment . The overlying rock blocks out cosmic rays . The SNO should detect about 10 solar neutrinos per day , about 50 times the rate of existing experiments other than Superkamiokande . Unlike the ordinarywater detectors , which are sensitive only to electron neutrinos , Sudbury 's heavy water will be sensitive to all three types of neutrinos , because they can knock the neutron from a deuterium nucleus to produce a different light signal . Thus we should soon know whether solar neutrinos change identity or not . Other experiments have already put some limits on the neutrino 's rest mass . The fact that high-energy neutrinos from Supernova 1987A arrived within just a few seconds of each other , after traveling 160,000 light-years from the Large Magellanic Cloud , sets the upper limit to the neutrino mass at about 16 electron volts ( S &T; October 1988 , page 348 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a rest mass of 511,000 eV An apparent breakthrough came in May , when scientists at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico announced that they had observed muon antineutrinos turning into electron antineutrinos in a high-energy particle experiment . They claimed that at least one of these neutrino flavors seems to have a rest mass of at least 0.2 eV and possibly much more . This result firms up a claim made at Los Alamos last year , but it still needs further confirmation . The solar neutrino problem could be resolved with as little as 0.003 eV or less . If neutrinos do have some mass , large numbers of them left over from the Big Bang might account for some of the invisible " missing mass " of the universe . They would be " nonbaryonic hot dark matter , " just the kind that many cosmologists want ( S &T; October 1994 , page 28 ) . Their collective gravity could influence the expanding universe 's early history and ultimate fate - though cosmologists really wanted 25-eV neutrinos , which would have been heavy enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In any case , a paradox that began at the heart of the Sun could have far-reaching consequences . We now turn our attention from the Sun 's innermost depths to its outermost atmosphere . WHY IS THE CORONA HOT ? The Sun 's rarefied , outermost atmosphere poses a mystery that has defied solar astronomers for even longer than the neutrino problem . How can the corona , so beautiful and familiar a sight at total eclipses , manage to exist ? The Sun has no surface ; its gas just becomes more tenuous the farther out you go . The visible sharp edge of the photosphere is something of an illusion . It is merely the level at which the gas becomes thin enough to be transparent . By convention , the layers above this level are called the solar atmosphere . The corona is its most extensive part . Somehow the corona is heated to a few million degrees Kelvin . This is one of the most fundamental , unsolved paradoxes of solar physics . The photosphere is hundreds of times cooler , even though it 's closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outward from a cooler to a hotter region . After all , when you sit far away from a fire , it warms you less . Clearly some mechanism is carrying energy up into the corona and dumping it there . Despite more than a half century of investigation , this mechanism remains unknown . Sunlight ca n't be it ; sunlight passes right through the transparent corona without depositing substantial energy into it . In 1949 solar physicists proposed that sound waves from the turbulent photosphere would turn into shock waves in the thin corona and heat it , but observations in the 1970s from the orbiting Skylab showed that very little acoustic energy of any sort can get that high . Magnetic plasma waves ( Alfven waves ) were then proposed , but these seem to pass right out of the corona without depositing much energy on their way through . A step toward locating the heating process is to study the Sun at ultraviolet ( UV ) , extreme ultraviolet ( EUV ) , and Xray wavelengths . These forms of radiation are emitted by very hot material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Photograph A close-up of the south polar coronal hole ( large dark region ) .

One very productive instrument has been the X-ray telescope aboard the Japanese Yohkoh satellite . Now we are getting a more comprehensive perspective with the ultraviolet and extreme ultraviolet instruments aboard SOHO , which is stationed 1.5 million kilometers Sunward from Earth and takes images continuously , 24 hours a day every day of the year . Such telescopes produce spectacular images of the Sun 's hot upper atmosphere seen against the photosphere , which is relatively dark at these wavelengths . At the high coronal temperatures , certain spectral lines are emitted by ions that are quite sensitive to their surroundings . Some spectral lines act as thermometers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensitive to the local density . Velocities of moving material can be inferred from Doppler shifts and line broadening . Observations in spectral lines that originate at different heights can be used to focus on different layers of the atmosphere . This way we can build up a threedimensional understanding of the bulk motions , physical evolution , and wave motions in the different magnetic structures pervading the solar atmosphere . The suite of instruments aboard SOHO is performing such experiments right now , giving solar astronomers hope that the coronal-heating problem will be solved soon . WHAT CAUSES THE SOLAR WIND ? The corona is forever expanding into interplanetary space , filling the solar system with a thin , perpetual outflow of ionized matter called the solar wind . At a certain distance from the Sun , where the solar gravity weakens , the gas pressure from the million-degree corona overcomes the gravitational attraction , producing a wind that accelerates away to supersonic speeds . As the outer corona disperses , it must be replaced by gases welling up from below to feed the eternal wind . Spacecraft measurements show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . Some of the wind has a speed of about 100 kilometers per second ; the rest travels about twice as fast . The slowspeed wind is an expected consequence of the corona 's high temperature . But no one really knows what gives the highspeed wind its additional push . The Ulysses spacecraft conclusively demonstrated that the high-speed component of the solar wind escapes from holes in the corona near the Sun 's poles ( S &TMarch; 1996 , page 24 ) . At least this was the situation near the current minimum of the Sun 's 11-year magnetic-activity cycle . Magnetic lines of force in the coronal holes stretch straight outward , providing a fast lane for the high-speed wind . The persistent coronal holes show up as large , irregular dark areas in EUV and X-ray images . The slower wind originates near the solar equator ( at least around activity minimum ) , but its exact source remains a mystery to be solved by future observations . Two instruments aboard SOHO use occulting disks to mask the Sun 's glare the way ground-based coronagraphs do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the photosphere out to 30 solar radii . These instruments are directly examining the regions where the corona is heated and the solar wind is accelerated . Both are providing new insight into the wind 's origin and acceleration . ENERGIZING SPACE NEAR EARTH SOHO is stationed just outside the Earth 's magnetic field , where another set of instruments is analyzing , in situ , the charged particles of the solar wind . When these data are combined with those from other instruments , the wind will be studied all the way from its source to the Earth . The Earth 's magnetic cocoon , or magnetosphere , is constantly buffeted and reshaped by the variable solar wind , and the gusty interplanetary " weather " can affect us significantly . By disturbing the Earth 's magnetic field it can produce geomagnetic storms , create auroras , disrupt radio navigation and communication systems , endanger astronauts , destroy satellite electronics , and cause power blackouts on Earth . Already researchers are seeing signs in SOHO 's data of the Sun preparing itself for coronal mass ejections days before they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigations of the origin , acceleration , and propagation of the solar wind will have a direct impact on human activity .
