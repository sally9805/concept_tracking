Rain chewed fresh gullies in the ridge road , turning the hard clay dirt to a yellow paste . The ditch overflowed and gray air blurred the low horizon . Dripping tree leaves hung limp and heavy , aimed at the ground . <p> " It 'll pass , " Mercer said . <p> Coe lit a cigarette and opened the pickup 's window an inch . Pellets of rain spattered his shoulder . The top of the windshield was breath-fogged from an hour of waiting and watching the rain . The truck cab smelled dog wet . <p> " Hope how soon that dozer comes , " Mercer said . " You ? " <p> Coe did n't answer . Finger-marks of mud streaked his red cap 's brim . He was from Deerspike , a river town where Mercer 's brother bought a used mobile home . Mercer was curious about Coe , the first stranger on the hill in seven years . <p> This morning , Coe and his boss had the trailer hauled halfway up the slope when rain turned the fresh-cleared earth to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The tow truck buried its rear tires , trying to pull the trailer free . Neighbor men who 'd come to watch laughed and laughed . They were waiting for the wet earth to pitch the trailer down the hill into the creek . Maybe the tow truck would follow , like a bluetick chained to a dogbox . The men would wait all day for that . It was worth the rain and chill . <p> " This ai n't bad , " Mercer said . " Setting in a truck for pay . How long you had this job ? " <p> " Three months . " <p> " Like it ? " <p> " No . " <p> " If it was me , I 'd like it , " Mercer said . " How come you to not to . " <p> Shifting wind drilled water against the roof . Coe tossed his cigarette out the window . Rain slammed it down and gutted it . <p> Coe watched the tobacco and paper vanish , wondering how people could live on vertical land . No sky . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woods so dense Coe could n't see past the tree line . He 'd heard that every hillbilly had one leg shorter than the other from years of walking on the slant . <p> Coe was surprised when rat-tail skinny Mercer climbed in the truck . They 'd sat an hour without talking . The midday air was dark as dusk . <p> " Before this , " Coe said , " had me a job eight years on a horse farm . " <p> " Good work if you can get it . " <p> " Not too awful bad . Helped the horse doctor till my wife 's cousin died . Told the boss I was going to the funeral and he said not to come back . " <p> " First cousin ? " <p> Coe nodded . <p> " What 'd you do ? " Mercer said . <p> " Went . " <p> " Get fired ? " <p> Coe nodded again . <p> " Got to stand by family , " Mercer said . " Man like him ai n't worth working for . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the truck door to face Mercer full on . Coe 's big hands lay ready on his thighs . " But some folks do n't like riggers . " <p> Mercer leaned forward , squinting , head cocked . " Hear that dozer , " he said . " About halfway up the hill , my opinion . " He looked at the water drenching the land . " Some folks do n't like nothing . " <p> Two water-dark figures rode the rumbling bulldozer to the top of the hill where Coe waved it out the ridge , then followed . The machine punched black smoke into the mist , and stopped beside an old hickory . Beneath the tree several men squatted , arms extended , elbows propped on bony knees . They waited in the rain as if it were sun , oblivious to the wet and the cold . Water glazed their faces to a uniform mask . <p> Only Mercer 's brother stood . He weighed three hundred pounds and had been married a month . For two weeks the brothers cleared a long narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a road and chain-sawed trees to stove-wood chunks . They plowed a trailer-sized notch into the hill , and together they buried a culvert under the new road for draining sewage to the creek . Jagged teeth of limestone protruded from the stripped land . <p> Mercer slammed the pickup door and walked through the dim fog . The men watched , wondering what Mercer had learned in the pickup . They 'd never ask but wait instead , wait a month or a year until Mercer brought it up himself . Then they 'd receive the truth , not a story tainted by the asking . <p> Mercer jerked his head to the bulldozer . " Old Abe 's here . " <p> " Late , " his brother said . He unleashed a stream of tobacco juice that dissipated rapidly in the rain . " He best not be too bad off . " <p> " You know he is , " said one of the men , unfolding upward from his squat . " Old Abe gets so drunk he takes back things he never stole . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawing another round of head-shakes and laughter . Eight years before , these same men dug Old Abe out of a caved-in mine a mile away . In one hand he held a long splinter of strut wood he 'd yanked from his face . Its sharp end spindled his eyeball . The company gave him a bulldozer with a loose track and three cylinders that did n't hit . After the mines were empty and the company gone , Old Abe owned the only dozer in the hills . A good swap , folks said . He 'd traded up . <p> Old Abe staggered through the mud , bandy-legged from a decade 's habit of staying upright while drunk . He jerked his head like a crow to see with his one good eye . " Hidy , by God ! Think it 'll rain ? " <p> " Do n't know , " said a man . " But it sure missed a good chance to if it do n't . " <p> Mercer 's brother used a blunt finger to search behind his lower lip for tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and slipped a fresh chew in his mouth . <p> " Reckon you can pull her out ? " he said . <p> Old Abe flicked water from his eyehole and stared at the trailer perched on the wet clay slope . Its crumpled end was jammed in the mud at an angle that showed plumbing and floorboards underneath . A heavy chain ran to a deeply mired tow truck . The truck driver lowered himself from the cab , holding tightly to the door . He slipped on the soap-slick ground and fell . Old Abe cackled . The driver skidded sideways down the hill , front leg stretched , the other bent , both arms flailing for balance . He plunged to his knees in the rushing ditch . <p> " Look out , boys , " Old Abe said . " He 's a-looking for a dance partner . " <p> The driver forced a grin as he slogged across the road . <p> " Name 's Richard , " he said . " You the dozer man ? " <p> " Ai n't needing one , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old Abe wadded his shirttail and wrung it out . The men watched , waiting , as he leaned forward and twitched his head . Strands of shiny wet hair clung to his face in diagonal strips . He peeled one back and sucked its tip . <p> " Richard , " he said . " Same as Dick , ai n't it . You the boss of this here outfit ? " <p> Old Abe howled , his over-large clothes flapping like birch bark flayed by wind . The men hid sly grins , looking up the hill or at their boots , having learned from the mines never to anger a foreman . They were workless sons of workers . <p> Richard breathed through his mouth to keep rain from his nose . Deerspike people only bought new mobile homes , trading an old one for down payment . Richard was running out of blacks to buy used trailers . The hill people were his next new market and he had to be careful . <p> " They say you work a dozer like a borrowed mule , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Old Abe poked out his lower lip and shook his head . " Not yet , I ai n't . Got to get myself lubed a little more . " He reeled to face the bulldozer . A man-shape hanging within the roll cage rocked and swayed . " Hey , Ike , toss me that bottle here ! " Old Abe grinned at the men and focused his single eye on Richard . " My boy was born lamed up but his eyes are good . He 's the one does the seeing for me . I 'd say Dick here could use a boy walking for him , way he come off that hillside . " <p> Old Abe showed his teeth and strutted to the bulldozer . The men followed , eager for heat against the hissing rain . Richard kicked mud from his boot . " Where 's Coe at ? " he said . " Hey , Coe ! " <p> " In the truck , " Mercer said . " I 'll get him . " <p> Mercer walked past the men sharing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clattered on idle . <p> " Save me a taste , " he said to the men . <p> Coe rolled the window down and pale cigarette smoke faded into fog . Mercer wondered why he stayed alone in the truck . A man only did that if he was trying to avoid a fight , but Coe worked hard and did n't say much . No one was mad at him . <p> " Bossman 's wanting you , " Mercer said . <p> " Do n't that figure . Him and that dozer feller get into it already ? " <p> " Old Abe 's half-drunk is all . " <p> " I would n't mind that , " Coe said . " I could stand a shot myself , day like this . " <p> " Might not be none left . " <p> " Not for me , anyhow . " He rolled his window up and left the truck . " Rain ai n't let up a hair . " <p> " No , " Mercer said . " But it 's only water . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tunnel of tree limbs . The wind had stilled . Rain dropped straight from the sky as if following ropes to the earth . As Mercer and Coe passed the bulldozer , the men hushed . <p> Mercer 's brother jerked his head to indicate a row of knife-sharp limestone sticking from the clay . The bank 's lower section had slid a few feet to block the ditch . Rain rushed over the dam and backwash flowed across the road , cutting new troughs to the creek below . Mercer knew the bank might not hold past dark . He watched Coe scuttle sideways up the muddy slope . One of the men passed Mercer the pint . With three fingers lost to a chain saw , the man 's hand was a C-clamp around the flat bottle . An inch of corn liquor sloshed the bottom . Mercer slipped it in his jacket . <p> Old Abe settled onto the bulldozer 's tape-covered seat . Behind him , propped in the roll cage with crippled legs dangling , was his son Isaac  --  Ike the Finder . He could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the farthest ridge . He was a water witch , too . In spring , Old Abe carried him like a sack of feed corn while Ike 's forked dowsing rod jumped and quivered . Of twenty-seven wells dug where Ike said , twenty-five hit underground springs . Folks blamed Old Abe for the two mistakes . He was drunk and did n't walk straight . <p> The dozer rattled up the slope , steel tracks flipping bricks of mud . Rainwater rushed to fill the ladder-shaped prints . Ike dangled like a scarecrow , yelling directions . The dozer moved easily over the mud , as Old Abe maneuvered it to the truck . <p> Standing ankle-deep in muck , Coe switched a chain from the tow truck to the bulldozer 's hitch . Richard gunned the truck , spattering mud . The chain rose taut and the bulldozer reared like a cornered bear . Old Abe released the tension . The machine slammed back to earth , spraying Coe with a sheet of yellow mud . The dozer tugged again , and the truck 's twin rear wheels spun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar . The straining truck suddenly jumped up the hillside and rain gushed into the deep hole . Clay dirt held it like a bowl . The men watched mud float in the yellow water . <p> Old Abe dragged the truck in a tight circle , and saluted the men in the road who punched one another 's soggy arms . Richard leaned from the truck window . His mouth raged in a shout that was lost to the sound of dozer and rain . Old Abe made another pass of the narrow swampy ridge and in a final sharp turn , he whipped the truck sideways , slinging great waves of mud into its open window . The tow truck stalled . Old Abe cut the bulldozer to a rumbling throb and waved to the men . The wet woods were black behind him . He sat alone on the rattling dozer . <p> " Where 's Ike , " Mercer said . <p> " Ai n't he up there , " said a man . <p> " Well , he ai n't gone far , " said another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> They watched Richard wave his hands and point to the rear of the truck . Old Abe eased to the muddy ground . <p> " Ai n't never seen him off that dozer on a job , " someone said . " Track probably come off . " <p> The men crossed the road to climb the hill . Mercer 's brother waited behind , watching , spitting over his shoulder . This was his land and his trailer . He would stay clear of mud . <p> Cold rain streamed Mercer 's face as he walked to a grassy bank untouched by plow or dozer . Climbing it was easier than the cleared slope . He circled the mud-flecked blue-and-white trailer , staying on the high furrow between tire tracks . Coe stood at the trailer 's low-pitched corner , head raised to a waterfall pouring off the roof . He wiped mud from his face and threw it to the ground . <p> " You aiming to shave next ? " Mercer said . <p> Coe stiffened . He stepped forward , anger fading as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mercer said , and tossed the bottle . <p> Coe caught it , uncapped the pint , and took a quick pull . He closed his eyes at the cool burn . " It 'll drink , " he said . " Do n't get that good in Deerspike . " <p> " Do n't know where it came from , " Mercer grinned . " Old Abe wo n't say either . " <p> " That dozer man 's dumb as dirt . " <p> " Boy of his is all right , " Mercer said . " Ca n't say how he got that way , but he did . " <p> " The son do n't have to be the pa . " <p> " Round here , he mostly is . " <p> " You people got it bad as us . " <p> " Maybe , " Mercer said . " I never knowed nobody else . " <p> They looked at each other , then away . Mercer watched raindrops pock the mud . Coe stared into the mist , thinking that he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coe knew how black folks were . He knew how they got that way , and who to blame . The hillbillies did n't . <p> They stood without speaking until Coe saw the men appear in the fog and approach the tow truck . <p> " Something done went wrong , " Coe said . <p> They crossed the mud to the men squatting around the truck 's rear end . Ike lay on his back , legs pinned beneath the truck 's doubled tires . His eyes were wide and he was shivering . Rain pooled in the creases of his clothes . <p> " You hurt bad ? " Old Abe asked . <p> " Ca n't tell , " Ike said . " Never did feel nothing down there . " He coughed and a red bubble formed at his mouth . " Get me up . " <p> " Swing that dozer around , " Richard said to Old Abe . " If I drive , the tires will spin on him . You 've got to haul that truck off nice and slow . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damn fool . " <p> Old Abe stumbled to the bulldozer , slowed by mud-weight on his boots . He turned and yelled . " Hey , by God , where 's that whiskey ? " Coe held the bottle up . <p> " Hell with it , " Old Abe said . <p> " Suits me , " said Mercer . <p> He yanked the bottle from Coe 's hand and drained the last of the clear liquor . The men glared at him . <p> The tow truck lurched a few yards , dappling the men with mud . Ike 's ruined knee spurted a red arc . Then another . And another . The men stared , bewildered and afraid . They had slaughtered hogs in autumn and field-dressed deer in the woods . They 'd seen mangled men dragged from the mines  --  crushed , turned blue from lack of oxygen , charred by a shaft fire . But none had watched a man slowly die . <p> " Goddamn it , " Old Abe yelled . He jumped from the bulldozer . " That 's my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's knee . The severed leg slid away . It sank in the hole where Ike lay and turned the water pink . A long sharp rim of rock jutted from the mud below Ike 's stump . <p> " We got to do something ! " Old Abe said . His eyehole held a thumb-sized wedge of clay . <p> " Not much a body can do , " said a man . The rest nodded around him . They 'd all lost kin ; it could n't be helped . " Tourniquet wo n't do no good , " said another . <p> Coe shouldered through the men and knelt in the mud . He pressed a wide hand over Old Abe 's pale shriveled fingers . <p> " Hold him like this . We need a rope or piece of harness . " <p> Old Abe knocked Coe 's arm away . " Reach for him again and you 'll draw back a nub ! " <p> Blood ribboned the air twice before Coe stopped it with his palm . His other hand held Old Abe back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said one of the men . <p> His voice was low and hard and the others moved to him . They waited in the cold gray rain , ready to back the man they knew . <p> " He do n't have to bleed to death , " Coe said . " I worked alongside a horse doctor nigh eight year . " <p> Between them , Ike leaned forward and saw the space where his leg should be . He fell back laughing a high-pitched cry . " Chop off the other one , " he said . " I do n't need them either one . " <p> The men glanced at each other , avoiding Coe 's impassive face . One by one they settled their patient gaze on Richard . He blew rain from his lips . The cluster of men stood between him and the road ; behind him was a thick wall of trees . <p> " He did work on a horse farm , " Richard said . " But I ai n't saying what all he knows . " <p> The men rubbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm opinion but giving an order would single him out as uppity . It was easier to walk away . They stared at Ike , their sweat now mixing with rain . <p> Mercer removed the snakeskin belt his father had made . He jingled the buckle . Everyone studied Mercer , stared at the belt he held . <p> " A colored woman saved my cousin and him done drowned , " Mercer said . <p> The men looked at each other , eyes flickering with memory . Slowly , careful to insure that the rest agreed , they began nodding to one another . They looked at Coe and waited . He did nothing until a man spoke , head turned to Mercer . " Wo n't hurt Ike no worse to try , " he said . " Better take hold of Old Abe first . " <p> Richard pulled him away . Old Abe released his son easily , too easily , and Mercer realized he had fainted . Richard laid him in the flowing silty mud . <p> Coe looped the belt twice on Ike 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exposed artery , tilted sideways , and pulled a knife from his pocket . " Somebody open this , " he said . The men looked at Mercer . He yanked the blade out and passed it back . Coe cut Ike 's pants and folded flaps of cloth aside . He sliced the withered leg from knee to mid-thigh , then carefully tugged six inches of artery from the slit . Twice it slipped from his hands like a tiny wriggling snake . Blood soaked into the earth . Coe squeezed the artery and looped a knot in its end , then lifted his hands away . The blood flow strained against the knot , leaking to the mud . Coe pulled the end tighter and the bleeding stopped . The artery bulged dark against the pale knot . Coe placed his cap over the stump . <p> " Get him to the truck , " he said . <p> The men moved to Ike as if he had four corners . Coe cradled his head . They lifted Ike and began moving slowly down the muddy slope . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they faded into fog rising from the hollow 's warmth . At his feet Coe 's knife lay half-buried in the mud . Mercer cleaned the blade against his pants and slipped it in his pocket . <p> Richard crouched behind Old Abe and shook him . As he sat , dark rain trickled from his eye socket . Richard raised him to his feet , then turned to Mercer . " Reckon we ought not leave that leg lying out here . Dogs might get it , or something . " <p> Air in the boot made it float on the puddle 's surface . Mercer lifted it by the heel , holding the leg away from his body as if poison . It did n't weigh much . He carried it down the hill , wondering what to do with it . <p> His brother stood alone in the road . Rain poured from his belly like a gutterless roof . His chin was laced with brown . <p> " Where 'd they all go ? " Mercer said . <p> " Took Ike to the doctor . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> " Feller driving the pickup . " <p> " You mean the rigger ? " <p> " No , " said Mercer . " That 's not who I mean , you son of a bitch . " He held Ike 's leg like a weapon . <p> His brother frowned . " Should n't say such about Mommy . " He spat tobacco . " What 's that you got there ? " <p> " Ike 's leg . " <p> " Never was no count . " <p> Mercer nodded and dropped it . Splashed mud landed on both their pants . A wind shift pelted rain against their backs . Dark sky moved over the ridge . <p> " Hill ai n't going to hold , " Mercer said . <p> " That trailer washes down in the road , " his brother said , " I 'll just leave it lay and plow a new road around it . I ai n't living nowhere else . " He sighed and looked at the sky . Water ran from his eyebrows . " Sure did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pickup where Coe sat and smoked . In the cab , Mercer held his sticky shirt away from his body . He was suddenly cold . Coe dropped his cigarette out the window . Mercer dug in his pocket . <p> " Here 's your knife , " he said . <p> Coe took the knife and bounced it in his palm . He glanced at Mercer , then handed it back . <p> " You might need it , " Coe said . <p> " I ca n't take a man 's knife . " <p> " It 's yours . " Coe tossed it in Mercer 's lap . " Ai n't that good a knife anyhow . " <p> " Reckon he 'll live ? " Mercer said . <p> " If he do n't , my name 'll come up . I got to get on home . " <p> Coe lit another cigarette and started the truck . He turned on the wipers and lights , and after a few minutes , curls of steam rose from the warming hood .
