Merrill Bahe was devastated . Five days earlier , his fiancee , Florena Woody , 21 , who had a history of asthma , had developed a breathing problem and died  --  just like that . The Navajo couple had fallen in love at the Santa Fe Indian School , where Merrill , 19 , was a star runner and Florena managed the track team . They had planned a life together . But now , on May 14 , there was nothing for Bahe to do but ready their 5-month-old son , Maurice , for his mother 's funeral in Gallup , N.Mex . Early in the 55-mile trip from their home in Littlewater , N.Mex. , to Gallup , Bahe too began gasping for breath . His sister-in-law stopped the car and called 911 , then administered CPR until an ambulance rushed him to the Gallup Indian Medical Center . But it was too late . Bahe was dead . " A lot of us were at Florena 's funeral , " says Indian School computer teacher Guy Monroe . " Merrill 's sister came in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past three weeks , the entire Navajo Nation  --  175,000 residents scattered over a 26,000-square-mile area , mostly in Arizona and New Mexico  --  has been in shock . A terrible flu-like illness has struck the area , afflicting 21 people and killing 11 , nine of whom were Navajos . Known at first as Unexplained Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ( UARDS ) , the disease  --  which seems to prey on young people in robust health  --  begins with fevers , muscle aches , conjunctivitis and headaches . Then it turns deadly with savage speed : The lung lining fills with fluid , asphyxiating the victim , sometimes within half an hour . For weeks the cause of the disease remained a mystery . Then , on June 4 , the New Mexico Department of Health announced that serum samples taken from three disease victims showed antibodies to a virus belonging to the Hantaan family group  --  named after the Han River in South Korea  --  which is spread through the feces and urine of rodents . Three days later antibodies to the virus were found in a fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Dr. Bruce Tempest , 57 , chief of medicine at Gallup Indian Medical Center . Tempest , who knew of Florena Woody 's death , was on call when Merrill Babe was brought in . " It 's a small hospital , " he says . " So when it 's a particularly tragic situation , people become aware of it right away . " When Tempest learned of an earlier similar death at the Gallup hospital and two others in Arizona , he was puzzled . He ordered tests to determine whether Bahe had succumbed to plague , which is endemic to the region . When results came back negative , Tempest contacted Dr. Gary Simpson , the state health department 's medical director for infectious diseases . Department officials quickly began an investigation . Using the resources of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta , the team made unexpectedly fast progress in identifying a suspect  --  the Hantaan virus . " We 've been remarkably lucky , " says Simpson . Investigators can only speculate where the virus came from and how long it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Navajo country may carry it and that virus-contaminated dust was inhaled when droppings were swept up . Indeed , there is an excess of rodent droppings this year because , as public-health officials learned from Navajo elders , there is an abundance of pinon nuts , a rodent diet staple . This is only the third time this century that there has been a year-round supply of the nuts . Says Dr. James Cheek of the Indian Health Service : " I believe the elders and medicine men might have been much closer than any of us to the cause of the disease . " Many Navajos , however , were not so cooperative . Information gathering , by investigators and the media , was thwarted by the Navajos ' reluctance to discuss the dead until at least four days had passed and the deceased person  --  according to traditional belief  --  had safely journeyed to the next world . Still , people all over the Four Corners region  --  where Utah , Colorado , Arizona and New Mexico meet  --  were , and are , frightened . Dr. Tempest says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Medical Center saw 2,800 patients in one day  --  2,000 more than on a normal busy day . " People are afraid of each other , " says Ervin James , a security guard at Pine Hill , a prosperous Navajo settlement on the Ramah Navajo Reservation . ( According to state health officials , people in the region of the outbreak should avoid rodent droppings ; when not possible , they should wear gloves and use disinfectant to remove the waste . Officials say the virus poses little danger to tourists . They should not , however , attract rodents by leaving food out . ) News of deaths from the mystery disease traveled quickly . Kimberly Bartlett , 13 , of Iyanbito , near Gallup , was attending a party at Red Rock State Park when she collapsed . She was dead the next day . Henry Henio Jr. , 21 , an aspiring forest-fire fighter living in Pine Hill , was seen by his friend Tony Jake Jr . " shopping with his fiancee at the minimall . " The next day he too was gone . Ragna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of her uncles was president of Iceland , but Ragna gave up everything  --  wealth and social position  --  for the love of an American G.I. named Douglas Hooks . In 1979 she followed him to the mountains of western New Mexico , where they made a life in an isolated double-wide trailer a mile from the nearest paved road . In 1982 , after Douglas died , the couple 's children tried to get Ragna to leave for her own safety . But , says her daughter Edna Yeomans , " she seemed bound to that mountain because of Daddy . " After five days in the hospital , Ragna died , apparently from the virus . On May 28 her children buried Hooks in native Icelandic dress next to her husband . Merrill Bahe and Florena Woody were bound by love too . By senior year at the Santa Fe Indian School , says teacher Guy Monroe , " they were shadows of each other . " Florena , says Monroe , " was always smiling and bubbly . " She wanted to be a nurse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was also a leader . " He was one of those rare kids , " says Monroe , " who can do anything , who was able to move between the two worlds  --  the Navajo world and the white world . " Since graduating in 1992 , Bahe had been studying computerized drafting at Crownpoint Institute of Technology . He was living with Woody in Littlewater . In addition to rearing their son , the couple  --  barely out of adolescence themselves  --  were looking after the children of one of Woody 's sisters . Four days after Florena died , Merrill  --  according to custom  --  visited the Indian School to collect donations from friends to pay for her funeral . Several days later the Bahe family came to the school to collect for Merrill . Now the community is pulling together once more . It is establishing a scholarship fund that one day will send Florena and Merrill 's son , Maurice , to the Indian School his parents attended . <p>               @ @ @ @ @ @
