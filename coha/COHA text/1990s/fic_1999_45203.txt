The Naked Ape <p> MY MOTHER WAS KILLED by a tumor when I was six . This was at the time when Western Australia was being invaded by Timorese refugees . In my child-mind , I thought they were the Tumorese and wondered at their desperate flights to the shores of Perth and Freemantle , where , sorry to say , there are tumors as well . My mother had not made it , but I would still look for her on the news when there was footage of the skinny , parched Indonesians being rescued from a rotting dinghy and set upon the firm deck of an Australian Naval Vessel . I could picture her in a hospital gown sitting expectantly in the middle of a raft , as the endless sea rolled out around her ; she sat with her legs swung around to one side leaning on her left hand , rising and falling in the gentle swells . <p> " Why are you so interested in Timor ? " my father asked . <p> " I 'm looking for Mum . " <p> And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two years-I was then eight-he did n't feel that he should understand ; and since I was a child , I did n't expect to make sense . <p> To my father my being a child was an interesting phenomenon . To me it was a handicap . Being a child made me short , less intelligent , and inclined to tears . It made me incapable of participating in the long-worded , far-reaching conversations between my father and his colleagues from the Anthropology Department , although he would let me sit at the table with them and sip coffee that was half milk and had at least a tablespoon of sugar . I tried to improve myself by reading books off my father 's shelf-I remember Collin Turnbull 's The Forest People , which was all about pygmies in some African jungle-but the words were long and even with the help of the dictionary , I only had a vague understanding of what was going on . <p> I went to school in much the same way that I imagined soldiers went to war . The other children felt alternately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or wanted to kick me in the teeth ( I read too much ) . I , in turn , was alternately avoided or injured . I informed my father of my situation one night over a bucket of fried chicken . <p> " They hate me , " I said . " They wo n't let me play with them , and I do n't think I want to . They 're primitive . " <p> " Primitive ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " Well , you 've got to make peace with them . " <p> " Why ? " <p> " Because last week Justin Lumis kicked your teeth in . " <p> " It was only one . It was loose anyway . " <p> " You have to make peace with them . " <p> My father went on to explain the concept of the participant-bystander . " Think of Collin Turnbull with the pygmies . He thinks that they 're short and strange , but he does n't tell them this . If they knew , he could n't live with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're one of them ? " <p> " Yes , " said my father . " They do n't know that you 're different , but you do . " <p> By the end of the week , my arm was in a cast ; it was broken in two places . I had followed the other children into an almond tree in the playground . I remember lying to Wendy Watts about how much I liked climbing trees . I was a tree-climber too , but I had n't fooled Justin Lumis . He followed me to the forked branch where I sat trying to look nonchalant and secure . <p> " I feel like a gibbon , " I said . <p> " Can gibbons fly ? " he responded . <p> I sat on the smooth , wooden bench outside Sister Margaret 's office waiting for my father . I contemplated the print that hung on the wall across the corridor-a print that I only looked at when I was in trouble and had been called to the office ; it was of archangel Michael aloft on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lance . My feet cleared the floor and I swung them back and forth while sitting on my hands . I loosened my tie and scratched my forehead where the wool of my hat-a navy blue bowler with a gold Loreto insignia-was beginning to itch . The ghost-voices of Sister Margaret and my father drifted out into the dark hall , echoing muffled and strange . My father 's complacent " I see , I see " and Sister Margaret 's " she needs help " and my father 's " I think she 's a fine individual " and Sister Margaret 's " there 's no doubt that she 's advanced , but is she happy ? " <p> My father exited Sister Margaret 's office with the same heavy face as everyone who escaped her after having been lectured for half an hour . He extended his broad , callused hand to me and I took it . <p> " Frances , I 'm afraid I 've been a negligent father . " <p> " No you have n't . " Negligent sounded really bad . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know . I miss Mum . " <p> " I 'm sure you do . " <p> The solution to my difficulty was to place me in a normal family three afternoons a week and one day a weekend . My father and I discussed the families in the neighborhood and decided that the only one worth considering was the Scala 's , who lived across the street and whom we dined with twice a month . They attended Holy Rosary like we did and had offered to watch me many times before . ( My father and I agreed that I did n't need watching , but they had offered all the same . ) So , my father invited Helena and Pasquale and their twelve-year-old daughter Maria-who could french-braid hair and play the piano , over for a pot of curry . Maria and I watched the adults growing garrulous and foreign with the help of Mr. Scala 's home-made wine . We escaped to my father 's study , where I pulled my favorite two books off the shelf : The Naked Ape , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and woman holding hands with a chimpanzee ; and Margaret Mead 's Coming of Age in Samoa , where depraved sixteen year olds rolled passionate and unashamed behind clumps of bamboo and exotic palm . <p> The next day , which was a Saturday , I asked my father over a bowl of cereal what a " naked ape " was . <p> " The naked ape ' is man . " <p> " Man is an ape ? " <p> " Yes . There are five members of the ape family . " My father held up his right hand . " Gibbons , chimpanzees , orangutans , gorillas , and , " he said , pointing to his thumb , " man . " <p> " Monkeys are n't a part of the ape family ? " <p> No , they were not . They were , however , primates . Primates had opposable thumbs , the kind of thumbs that let you answer the phone and operate a can opener . My father and I sat across from each other proudly waggling our thumbs , proud to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naked ape , ' why are we the only apes that wear clothes ? " I asked . <p> " Maybe you 're an ape , Frances , " said Justin Lumis , " but I 'm not . " <p> " You are too . " <p> " Am not . " Then he flipped me off . I know he wanted to hit me , but my arm was still in a cast . I watched him sadly as he walked back to the drinking fountain , where some other children were gathered . Justin was evil and I knew this , but he was the only kid that ever talked to me and in a way he was my only friend . <p> " How did you like your afternoon with the Scalas ? " my father asked over dinner . <p> " I do n't think it 's going very well . Maria did n't want to braid my hair and she 's sick of playing chopsticks with me . " <p> " What did you do ? " <p> " I read a book . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . I had wandered from room to room trying to find a place where I felt at ease . I sat in the dining room and waggled my thumbs trying to see a transformation . Would the other children play with me now ? I imagined myself dropped off at the zoo and brought to the monkey house where I would pass time with a family composed of a gorilla , a gibbon , a chimpanzee , an orangutan , and me . Would they notice I was naked ? Mr. Scala was sitting in the living room drinking more of the blood-red home-brew , flopped back in his recliner watching a soccer game on TV . Maria had locked her bedroom door . Mrs. Scala was in the kitchen stirring a pot of sauce . The smell was thick in the kitchen . It was the smell of Mrs. Scala and it clung to her clothes as an appetizing perfume . The air by the stove was steamy and warm . <p> " Mrs. Scala ? " <p> " Yes dear . " <p> " Do you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why not ? " <p> I recited to her and she said that " it was very nice . " <p> The pygmies are short . They run through the jungle in search of wild pig , spears in hand . They run , boom , boom , boom , through the rain forest . They see a boar . Quiet now . The pygmies move slowly , creeping along the slimy jungle  --  floor like snakes . They climb into a low tree and take aim with their lances . They leap down ! <p> I jumped off the couch and grabbed Maggie Mead , the cat . I held her above my head . <p> " Now I 'm going to eat you , " I said . <p> " Frances , leave the cat alone , " said my father . " We have a real dead pig in the backyard . Why do n't you go look at it ? " <p> I left the living room and wandered outside . The yard was full of dark , springy-haired people whose hair was illumined into halos as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annual Papua New Guinea Students Alliance pig roast ( also known as the PaNGaSA pig fest ) and they were digging a pit about five feet along the sides , maybe three feet wide and at least that deep . The pig was on the ground with an apple in its mouth as if the cause of death had been asphyxiation . I felt like patting it or taking it to a vet . It looked like a seven-foot-long baby mouse . <p> Terry , my father 's secretary , rested a hand on my shoulder . " Are you hungry ? " <p> " No . I was hungry , " I said . <p> " It will be very good , " she said . <p> " Do I have to eat it ? " <p> " You 'll like it . Just you see . It 's going to be yummy . " <p> I did n't like Terry because she used words like " yummy . " And she was calling the house now , even on Saturdays . And on Friday I had seen her car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's living room window . And she would n't stop talking to me and trying to hold my hand . She took my hand , took me over to the edge of the completed pit . They were throwing soft-ball sized rocks into it . I squinted my eyes and pretended that they were shrunken heads , like the ones in the pictures my father had taken in The Philippines , pictures of the Igorot Indians who were headhunters and wore the heads dangling from belts around their tattooed waists . <p> My father had joined us . He rested his hand on Terry 's shoulder and I decided that my mother would have hated Terry too . <p> " Is n't this interesting , Frances ? " <p> " No , " I said . " I think this pig pit looks like a grave . " <p> Wednesday afternoon was a Scala afternoon . <p> " Hurry up , Frances , " my father called from the hallway . <p> I emerged from his study with a book . <p> " What have you got there ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was The Island of the Menstruating Men . I had looked up " menstruate " in the dictionary and discovered that it had something to do with women cycling once a month and bleeding , which I 'd never noticed anyone doing ; I was determined to keep an eye out for it . <p> " Better leave the book with me , Frances , " he said . <p> " What am I going to do ? " I asked . <p> " Why do n't you bring some dolls over , or something like that . " My father escorted me back to my room and I selected Barbie and Ken from my toy chest . I looked over my shoulder and turned to present them to him , extending my hands out before me in a gesture both resigned and expectant . My father nodded in approval . <p> At the Scala 's , I hid behind the couch in the living room playing " Coming of Age in Samoa " with a naked Barbie and a naked Ken , but I really did n't have to hide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning to resemble the kids at school in many ways . I looked forward to six o'clock in much the same way that I looked forward to 3:15 . There had been no change in my relations with my classmates , but Sister Margaret seemed pleased with my progress . She attributed my success to the Scalas when , in truth , it belonged to the cast that was still on my arm and would be for another month . <p> On Saturday , my father and Mr. Scala and I went to a Rugby game . Our team was Nedlands , which usually won and usually played at home on a graceful field on the banks of the Swan River . After that , we returned to the Scala 's for dinner . And Saturdays were usually quite dull , but I do remember one when my father and Mr. Scala drank a lot of red wine and sang in various flatnesses and inappropriate sharps with a recording of Nessun Dorma by Pavarotti . Mrs. Scala , who had also been drinking , came in with a basket of tomatoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handed me a tomato and encouraged me to throw it . She said : <p> " This is what we do in Italy when they sing so bad . " <p> Sunday was my only day off . My father and I were in the backyard . I was watching him cut back the vines which had taken over the back fence and were threatening a guava tree that my mother had planted there three years before . The sky was a sharp blue and the cold light glinted off my father 's long knife , which he swung with purpose and control . <p> " Is that a bolo ? " I asked . <p> " In The Philippines it is called a bolo . The more common term for a knife like this is a machete . " <p> " Do you think we 'll find something ? " <p> " Like what ? " <p> " Like the missing link ? " <p> " I do n't know , Frances . Stranger things have happened . " <p> Then the phone started ringing out through the back door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said and started running for the house . <p> It was Mrs. Scala . She was hysterical . My father had to go over there immediately . Pasquale had cut off his thumbs . <p> This is how I like to think it happened : <p> It is May , one of those almost Autumn days where the temperature has fallen to a comfortable cool and the leaves might actually be thinking of falling . Mr. Scala is pushing his handsome mower , stopping on each alternate row to walk back to the porch and gulp from a carafe of red wine . He is looking at the trees that still hold green leaves and will hold them stubbornly throughout the winter . His mind is at ease and he is singing to himself some Italian tune ( Santa Lucia springs to mind , although the Scalas were from Naples ) . He can not think of anything he would rather do than stand on the porch of his newly renovated house , smoothing his wiry gray mustache , drinking his wine ( close to vinegar , but his none-the-less ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he saw his yard slowly laying itself out in smooth strips of trim green , edged in lines of clippings that pushed farther and farther out to the graying pickets of his back fence , a lawn as unvariegated and even as a blank sheet of note paper . Mr. Scala looks up at the sky , at the perfect shade of blue that gazes benignly down on him with the sun as its pupil , and he takes another gulp of wine , pulls his gray trousers up the sloping roundness of his stomach , then lets them slide to where the suspenders have decided they should hang . He wipes his hands on his sweat-stained undershirt , then strides to his mower that purrs and growls . He is about to resume pushing when he notices something glittering golden in the grass , close to the front of his mower . He remembers Helena complaining that she 'd lost a bracelet a few days ago , a gold one from Florence . It is just at the edge of the blades . The sun glints on the blades and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scala bends down to get the bracelet , then , whoosh , the blood gushes and he sees his thumbs lying side by side on the ground , peering up at him with the innocence and annoyance of a wronged child . <p> " My thumbs ! " he says . ( Actually , he says " Mi ditti pollicci ! " ) <p> He yells in horror , not pain . <p> " Mi ditti pollicci ! Mi ditti pollicci ! " <p> Helena was hysterical . Between the time my father set the phone in its cradle and the time we arrived at the Scala 's house , she had taken some heavy duty tranquilizers . She was still holding the bottle in her hand when we arrived . <p> " I ca n't go with you to the hospital , " she said . " In ten minutes , I will be asleep . " <p> Mr. Scala was in the kitchen . His hands were wrapped in towels and I remember watching the blood stains growing and thinking it looked an awful lot like time-elapse shots of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " said my father . <p> " Where are what ? " <p> " Your thumbs , Pasquale . Where are your thumbs ? " <p> " They are in the backyard by the mower . Carlton , be careful ! " <p> My father filled a glass of water into which he dropped some ice cubes and took it into the backyard . When he returned , Mr. Scala 's thumbs were inside resting on the bottom as if they were tranquil goldfish . <p> We walked in single file to the door . I lead bearing the thumbs in the glass . They were revolting yet fascinated me in the same way that insects did . Mr. Scala walked behind me , holding his blood-soaked , towel-mitted hands out in front of him . My father brought up the rear . <p> " Helena , " he said , " I 'll call you from the hospital . " <p> She looked up , sleepy-eyed and disoriented . " Dove e il mio braccialetto ? " she said . <p> I sat on the backseat of the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the reddened water sloshed onto the legs of my corduroys . My father was driving rather unevenly , sudden stops and fast corners-and I waited in patient fear for one of the thumbs to tip out and flop on my lap . <p> " Do you think they 'll be able to sew them back on ? " I asked my father as I sipped coffee in the waiting room . <p> " I certainly hope so , " my father replied . <p> " And if they ca n't , will Mr. Scala still be a primate ? " <p> My father raised an amused eyebrow . " Yes , Frances , he will still be a primate , but unable to use a can opener . " <p> The doctor came up to us , clapping his hands together in a pleasant , optimistic way . It seemed that the thumbs could be returned to their original location , but that Mr. Scala would have to suffer among the ranks of the less evolved for at least three hours . <p> There was no answer when my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , after all , there was nothing we could do at the hospital . I had pink blood stains on the lap of my favorite cream-colored corduroys from where the water had sloshed over on the drive there . I watched them dry-the edges growing in darker outlines-on the way back . <p> Maria answered the door . She was in her netball uniform complete with her Number 7 apron ; her face was pale and she seemed confused . <p> " It 's Mum , " she said . " She wo n't wake up . " <p> " Is she breathing ? " asked my father . <p> " Yes . I checked , but she wo n't wake up . " <p> " How long has she been like that ? " <p> " I do n't know . I just got home . " <p> My father went into the house leaving me and Maria standing on the front porch . <p> " Your dad cut his thumbs off , " I said . <p> " Did not . " <p> " Did too . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " You 're such a liar , Frances . " <p> " Am not . " I pointed to my pants . " Those are blood stains . I had to carry the thumbs in a glass of water , and some of it spilled out . " <p> Maria regarded the pants . She pulled at one of my legs inspecting the stain closely . I could hear my father on the phone in the hallway . <p> " Wait a sec , " I said . " Listen . " <p> Maria let go of my leg and we stood together , heads bowed . He was calling an ambulance . Maria ran into the house ; I followed and was hit in the face with the swinging door . I stood with my hands on my smarting nose watching my father through the screen . He was standing in the hallway , tired and worried , but I could hear Mrs. Scala 's gentle snoring from the living room and was n't sure what the big problem was . He came and stood beside me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have your house key ? " <p> I pulled it out from beneath my sweater , where it hung on a black piece of cord . <p> " You go home and I 'll call you in a little while . All right ? " <p> " Why ca n't I come too ? " <p> " I think you 've seen enough of the hospital for one day . " Then he added : " If Terry calls , tell her to meet me at the Bethesda Emergency Room . " <p> I would have protested , but he seemed so grave . I walked carefully down the stairs , but broke into a run on the edge of the lawn and ran back to my house not bothering to slow down to cross the street . <p> I was angry even though my father hated the hospital - especially the Bethesda Hospital , where he knew the location of every coffee machine . I hated hospitals because all adults went there and sometimes they did n't come back . Sometimes I thought that my mother still might be there wandering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nurse so that she could put them in water . I sat crosslegged on top of the filing cabinet in the study looking out through the dirty window pane as they loaded Mrs. Scala 's snoring body into the ambulance . Maria was leaning against my father and I saw that he had his arm around her . Then the sirens went on and I watched the ambulance rounding the corner of the street with my father 's car behind it . In the hospital , the world existed in odd balance . Babies wailed behind glass screens . Doctors walked among the beds armed with clipboards reading out their judgements , blessing life and bestowing death . Old men with glassy eyes and open , toothless mouths sat parked in wheelchairs about the corridors as their life flowed out of them into little bottles ; through the plastic tubes I 'd seen that life was yellow . Patients were wheeled about , fed with sleep or cured of it . Restored , removed , constructed and destroyed-I had seen it all , as had my father . And he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand any more than I did ? <p> I was packing my things . I was n't sure how long I would be gone , but there was no point in staying . I 'd read something in Coming of Age in Samoa about needing to leave the house in order to be wiser . I decided to bring only one bag because it would be easier to carry . The river was only a quarter mile away . I could make a raft by tying branches and sticks together . I packed rope , and a garbage bag to waterproof my vessel . I would float down the river past the yacht club and rugby field , then I would hit the open sea , full of sharks and opportunity . Everything happened on the edges of the sea . Somewhere past the mouth of the river were the gibbons , the pygmies , and the menstruating men . Somewhere out there was my mother in her hospital gown . I imagined myself waving at the Tumorese , sharing rice with them in exchange for one of my apples . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along side of me , of the pygmies with their wise , dark faces looking over the railing as I floated there , sunburned , skinny , and brave . Or maybe I would never be rescued and I would float forever , eating coconuts that bounced in the waves , spearing fish with a lance made from a part of the raft-eating them raw . I would be part of the sea , and the salt , and the promise of land just behind the line of horizon and always out of reach . <p>
