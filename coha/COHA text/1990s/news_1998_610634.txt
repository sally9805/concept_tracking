<p> Rep. Bill Paxon was furiously working the phones from his home in Alexandria last Friday afternoon , calling Republican colleagues to solicit surreptitious support for his challenge to unseat House Majority Leader Dick Armey . <p> While her father was talking , Susan Ruby Paxon  --  the 21-month-old daughter of the rising Republican star and his wife , former representative Susan Molinari  --  toddled over to declare , " Tape ! Tape ! " She wanted him to put her Winnie the Pooh video into the VCR and watch with her . <p> Paxon watched , and intermittently kept making phone calls for the effort that he envisioned would eventually take him to the speaker 's chair next year , assuming that Newt Gingrich runs for president in 2000 . <p> Susan Ruby , meanwhile , announced : " Walk ! "  --  it was time for Daddy to go outside with her to walk George , the Labrador mutt named for George Bush . <p> It was then , after three sleepless nights , and shortly after " Tape ! Tape ! " and " Walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not just to drop his campaign against Armey , but to chuck a remarkable 21-year political career and quit the business altogether . <p> Bill Paxon had lost his taste for the fight and for staying in the Congress . His announcement yesterday that he was retiring was a stunning turn for a political couple that once seemed to embody the future of the Republican Party . <p> He was smooth , politically savvy and conservative . She was moderate , supported abortion rights and was a third-generation politician . They were both young and telegenic . Just 18 months ago , they captivated the Republican National Convention in San Diego . Molinari left the House seven months ago to host a CBS News show  --  and by year 's end , Paxon will be gone , too . <p> Paxon made his announcement knowing full well that many in Washington would suspect an ulterior motive . Nobody that close to power could just walk away . But Paxon knew , too , the value of staying " on message , " and he repeated again and again and again  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Capitol Hill news conference , in a six-hour whirlwind trip to Buffalo and to Rochester  --  that he was leaving politics because of his little girl . <p> His whole life has been politics : Paxon 's father was a judge and his mother a Republican activist . He has spent his entire adult life in office since he won a seat in the Erie County , N.Y. , legislature in 1977 right out of Canisius College in his native Buffalo area . Then on to the state legislature in Albany . Then to Congress in 1988 , winning the seat of his idol , Jack Kemp , for whom he 'd campaigned as a teenager . <p> Paxon rose quickly under the mentorship of Gingrich . He chaired the National Republican Campaign Committee from 1993 to 1996 and was widely credited with helping to craft and finance the historic GOP takeover of the House in 1994 . But last July , Paxon was forced to quit a Republican leadership post after an aborted plot to topple Gingrich and install him as speaker . <p> Over the weekend , Paxon had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his closest friends and aides , all sworn to secrecy . After 5 p.m. on Tuesday , Paxon , 43 , broke his news to his staff , assembling them on the plush leather couch and chairs in Room 2412 of the Rayburn House Office Building , while staffers in his two New York offices listened on speaker phones : <p> " Umm , I do n't know where to begin , but I think you 'll understand what I am going to say . This is very difficult . I have always planned to be in politics . It 's been 21 years . I have been running around the country and it comes to the point I have to make a decision . The choice is to run for majority leader  --  or leave . I have taken a lot of time and I have realized something has changed , and this is my family . . . . My decision is to put family first . . . . I have decided not to run for reelection . " <p> The room was silent . Tears welled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind his desk , across from the playpen  --  littered with plush toys  --  that Susan Ruby occupies when she visits . <p> " I decided last week to run for majority leader , and after that it was hell , " he continued . " This is a tough decision . We have been through a lot together and it 's very difficult . " His voice cracked and trailed off . He began to cry . He took a handkerchief from his pocket and dabbed his eyes . " I love you all , and you are like family , and this hits me hard . . . . <p> " I will never run for public office again . I just have to tell you , it became clear as could be last Friday . It was clear to me my heart was n't in it anymore . . . . I just want to say thank you . Thanks for being such good friends . " <p> As the stunned staff got up to leave , Chris Downing , a 28-year-old legislative aide , turned to Paxon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the best decision you ever made . " <p> Just before , Paxon had called one of his closest political friends , Tom Reynolds , the Republican minority leader of the New York state assembly . " Tommy , I feel strongly I can run and win this . But my heart is n't in it , " Paxon said . If he won a leadership post , Paxon noted , " it 's four to five years on the road . I did this for 21 years , Tom , and I do n't have it in my heart anymore . . . . Thursday and Friday I 'm home alone with the baby and I realize that 's what I wan na do . . . . It 's out of pure joy I 'm doing this . . . . Every time I 've been going out on Saturdays , I 'd rather be home . <p> " I could run for majority leader and I think I would win it , and then a year from now the speakership . . . . You are making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weekend . It 's not fair to my 21-month-old daughter . Last Wednesday , I 'd decided to run and I just felt like expletive . " <p> In an interview before he went public , he continued to stress his family over politics . " Twenty years from now , my daughter wo n't give a hoot if I was speaker or majority leader or on a highway crew , " he said . " She wants to know if her daddy 's there . " After Molinari left Congress , " she never looked back , and she is happy with being home with her daughter , and that inspired me too , " he said . <p> " Maybe it 's because I am 43 and my dad died last year , and my dad was 42 when I was born and he was always the oldest father among my friends . . . . I wanted to be around for my daughter . I was asking myself , ' How do you possibly do justice to this child and still do the job ? ' " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I am sure we will see stories that say , ' You have a fatal flaw ' and we will see stories with people saying , ' You must have something wrong with you , ' that ' You have to be crazy to give this up . ' " <p> Indeed , Paxon himself had been struggling with such feelings . Since Susan Ruby was born , he has been more torn between work and family . And as he worked the phones last week lining up support , he felt his enthusiasm ebbing . " By Friday , I was finally saying what my heart has said for the last two years . . . . Friday , I spent the day on the phone , and people were enthusiastic , but I had no spark . . . . I had been thinking , ' Maybe I 'm like an old war horse ; if the bell goes off , I 'll do it , I 'll run for it , ' " he said . " Well , the bell went off , and this horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Still , he said he has no regrets . " I got to do exactly what I wanted for 21 years . I did exactly what I wanted and had fun doing it , and the next 20 years will be based on ' How does it affect my family and my time with my daughter ? ' . . . <p> " Susan was great . She said she would make allowances in her schedule " if he ran for leadership , Paxon said . " But particularly because we want to have more children  --  and I am 43 and she will be 40  --  the question is , ' Who is going to raise the babies ? ' " <p> Bringing Up Baby <p> Susan Ruby , who became a 3-month-old TV celebrity during the 1996 Republican convention when her mother gave the keynote speech while her father bounced her on his knee , has been going to day care in the House child-care center , but has caught repeated colds and ear infections that may require the insertion of plastic tubes in her ears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep her home , with the help of a babysitter . <p> He said he considered staying in Congress without seeking a leadership post . " This place and this profession is like a narcotic . . . . It 's also like a fraternity , and some people are afraid to leave it , " he said with a laugh . " Do they give methadone for political withdrawal ? " <p> In the end , though , he concluded that " it is still very hard to have a young family , with Susan going off to New York for her work . . . . It was either move up or out , and at a certain point in life , you got ta say , ' Been there , done that . ' " <p> Yesterday morning , after keeping strict secrecy about his decision , Paxon had 600 letters delivered by Federal Express to members of Congress , his friends and supporters , announcing his decision and saying of his daughter , " This little girl has helped me turn what has always been unthinkable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , after telling the Republican leadership at a closed meeting , Paxon  --  a black cross on his forehead from Ash Wednesday Mass  --  faced skeptical Washington reporters in his office . Was Newt Gingrich really behind his departure ? Was Armey ? Was he quitting because he realized he could n't beat Armey ? And was n't this really the fall of a glamour Washington couple , since he and Molinari had both been rising stars ? <p> " This is not a fall . This is a rise , " Paxon said . " This is what we want to do for our family . . . . This is not a fall . This is a rise . A lot of families do this " in making career sacrifices . <p> Paxon said he did not have any plans for his future and was not even sure when he would decide what he would do after his term expires next January . He might go into business , he might teach  --  he did n't know . He might leave Washington , perhaps for New York . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , he seemed dazed . " What was the question ? . . . I 'm sorry . I only had four hours sleep . . . . Sorry , I lost my train of thought . " <p> Afterward , Paxon , Molinari and the baby they call Suby took off in a chartered seven-passenger Cessna jet for Buffalo and Rochester . Molinari , smiling and hugging her husband when they met at the airport , said she had already received several calls at home from reporters expressing disbelief . <p> " They could not believe he was just leaving , " she said . <p> Molinari herself acknowledged she was " in shock " when Paxon told her Saturday of his decision . " Bill has loved government . I thought he 'd be in Congress for the rest of his life . As an American I am sorry " he is leaving , she said . " As a wife and mother , I could n't be happier . " <p> The Cessna took off at 11:40 and immediately encountered sharp turbulence , frightening the baby and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pony ride ! It 's like a pony ride ! Juice ! Juice ! "  --  until Suby calmed down . <p> When they touched down in Buffalo , Suby 's diaper needed changing . Molinari , rather than Paxon , did the honors because his technique is " too methodical and slow , " she said . <p> Suby , a political baby staying on message , attracted much of the attention at news conferences in Buffalo and Rochester , laughing , cooing , tugging on the American flag and reading aloud some of the letters on a big sign bearing her father 's name . At both stops , Paxon basked in her antics . At both stops , he choked with emotion . <p> And at both stops there were skeptical questions . " A lot of people are asking the question , ' Is there something else behind this ? ' " a reporter in Buffalo asked . <p> Paxon smiled and said , " I am done having to justify my life . " The crowd , consisting largely of his staff and friends , burst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to get his explanation out . In his van between stops , the congressman made a series of phone calls to politicians and journalists , including conservative columnists Robert Novak and Fred Barnes . <p> The 1,000-mile jaunt was carefully planned so the media-conscious Paxon could get back to Washington by late afternoon , in time to appear live on CNN 's " Inside Politics " and give his version of why he was leaving Congress . <p> " You have to tell your story , otherwise other people 's spin gets ahead of you , " Molinari explained . <p> Moving Up , and Out <p> A year ago , Paxon and Molinari were becoming the hottest ticket in the GOP . <p> Molinari was No. 5 in the House GOP leadership , which is dominated by white males from the South . She was the leading weapon in the party 's effort to broaden its appeal among women and voters in the Northeast  --  where the party suffered its worst losses in the 1996 elections  --  as it sought to enlarge its House majority and capture the White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a protege and loyal supporter , to preside at meetings of GOP leaders and oversee long-range planning , making him the highest appointed member of the leadership . And Paxon had worked unflinchingly to coordinate the effort to save Gingrich 's speakership after he acknowledged House ethics rules violations . <p> Then in May , Molinari , frustrated that her support of abortion rights limited her ability to advance in the leadership and win plum committee assignments , announced she was leaving Congress to anchor " CBS News Saturday Morning . " <p> But the biggest blow to the Republican power couple came in July , when dissident House Republicans discussed toppling Gingrich and installing Paxon as speaker . Paxon declined to detail his role in the events beyond saying it was not his intention to try to become speaker . <p> " I never wanted the speaker to leave , " he said in a recent interview . " Honest to God , I did n't want it to happen . I did n't encourage it . But it happened and that was my fate . " <p> When Paxon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paxon to quit his leadership post . But before he could , the New York lawmaker offered to resign . Gingrich accepted the resignation the next morning . <p> A week later House Republicans met behind closed doors and many feared the mutual hostilities could spin out of control . Paxon helped calm the session by rising to declare : " If you want a head , you 've got mine . " <p> Exiled from the leadership , Paxon set about to rebuild his base of support among House Republicans . As the two-term head of the House GOP campaign committee , Paxon had a hand in the election of nearly half of the chamber 's 227 Republicans , winning him some degree of loyalty of each . He crisscrossed the country , raising money for GOP candidates . In preparation for these appearances , his staff sent copies of a Weekly Standard article headlined " Speaker Paxon ? " to be distributed to those attending . At the same time , he moved to beef up his political action committee , which he intended to use to help yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a leadership bid . <p> As the year began , he and his staff talked openly of challenging Armey , vulnerable because of his lackluster organizational skills and stumbling manner , to be majority leader . Paxon canvassed his colleagues , gauging his support , at the House GOP retreat in Williamsburg , Va. , earlier this month . <p> At the same gathering , Gingrich pulled him aside to ask if he could count on his support to be speaker in the next Congress , if the Republicans maintain control . Paxon replied that he could . <p> What about for Armey ? the speaker asked . Would Paxon support him to be reelected as majority leader ? <p> Paxon replied he could n't commit ; he was still weighing his options . <p> Beginning today , those options no longer include elective office . After all this , Paxon said , " I quickly fade into oblivion . There is nothing deader than a dead politician . They bury you , and do n't even embalm the body . "
