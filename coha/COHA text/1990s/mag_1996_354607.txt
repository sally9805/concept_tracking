EVEN BEFORE HIS UPSET WIN IN NEW HAMPSHIRE , Pat Buchanan was plotting his next vital conquest : South Carolina . " It 's the key to the kingdom , " Buchanan said of this Saturday 's primary , the first one in the region . " It sets the tone in the area you need to win the nomination and the election . Lose there , and it can all dry up on you . It 's gon na be tough , but they 're natural rebels down there , and I 'm a member of the Sons of Confederate Veterans . They like my red-meat stuff . They like exaggeration . " <P> So there was Buchanan in South Carolina on the morning after New Hampshire , pushing protectionism . And exaggerating like crazy . " Get this ! " he fairly screamed , ecstatic to have found a fresh example of the " Beltway betrayal " of America 's workers by the " corporate killers who line their pockets as jobs flee the country . I just heard that another South Carolina textile mill has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( or more precisely , it soon will ) . But the real story of the closing of the Lydia textile plant , about 60 miles west of Columbia , the state capital , is more nuanced than Buchanan would ever be willing to admit . " Foreign competition is always a factor , " says Michael Hopp , vice president of C.M.I. , Inc. , the company that owns the Lydia plant . " But it 's mostly about modernization and market shifts . " C.M.I. runs four fabric-producing plants in South Carolina . The company has poured millions of dollars into upgrading three of the plants . The fourth , Lydia , is a victim of automation and increased worker productivity . " The closing would have happened without NAFTA , " says Hopp , who will transfer about half of Lydia 's 400 employees to the other plants . The rest will be let go . " Demand is down . People are spending more on things like electronics than on clothing . That 's the key , not low-cost imports . " <P> South Carolina 's textile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1973 to fewer than 90,000 today . But overall employment and investment are at record levels , thanks largely to the state 's successful wooing of foreign businesses like BMW and Fuji film . " You make money by joining the world , " says Carroll Campbell , the popular former Governor who 's leading Bob Dole 's South Carolina effort . " Sober people realize that . " <P> Indeed , this is a state where Buchanan 's protectionism may bump against local history . South Carolina has long favored free trade . It seceded from the Union in part because of Washington 's high tariff policy , which John Calhoun branded the " great instrument of our impoverishment . " Bob Dole 's embrace of a bill restricting textile imports in 1988 did him no good here  --  he lost that year 's South Carolina primary to free-trader George Bush . <P> This time Dole has the big-name endorsements and the formidable grass-roots organization here . And a huge stake in the outcome . " We need to win South Carolina , " says Scott Reed , the Dole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What the Dole camp fears most is losing the evangelical Christians , who could account for half the vote . " And Alexander could siphon off enough of the rest to give us real trouble , " says Campbell . Not to worry , says David Beasley , the current Governor , who owes his office to the Christian Coalition . " We 'll win it for Dole , " he said last Wednesday , as his face contorted with desperate hope . " I mean , I guess we will . I think so . "
