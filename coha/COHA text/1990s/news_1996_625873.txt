<p> WASHINGTON - For months , Gov.John Engler of Michigan ducked making an endorsement in the GOP presidential race , claiming he had to be hands-off as chairman of the Republican Governors Association . <p> As late as Wednesday , Engler 's spokesman said that the governor would not budge from his neutrality . <p> But within 24 hours and with a little fancy footwork , Engler got in line behind Sen. Bob Dole . <p> Just another sign it 's audition time . <p> For as Dole tours the Midwest in advance of four industrial state primaries on Tuesday , he will also be checking out some of the hottest prospects to be his Republican vice presidential running mate . <p> If the senator asks Colin Powell to join the ticket , and the retired general , as promised , refuses , Dole could easily turn to a Midwestern governor for his vice presidential nominee . <p> First , it 's conventional wisdom that , minus Powell , Dole , as a consummate Washington insider , probably should consider picking a GOP politician from outside the Capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executives of the states holding primaries next week : Engler , George Voinovich of Ohio , Bob Edgar of Illinois , and Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin . <p> Additionally , attention already is being focused on two of those governors , Engler and Voinovich . <p> Both are popular figures at home and were re-elected in landslides last fall . <p> They are playing appropriately coy , but there are some changes in the way each man approaches the issue . <p> Although Voinovich told the Cleveland Plain Dealer earlier this year , " " I am not interested in the vice presidency , " his spokesman Mike Dawson said this week that the governor would give any offer " " serious consideration . " <p> Engler decided early on that , using the Republican Governors Association as a cover , he would remain neutral - unlike Voinovich , who was the first of what through this week had been 24 Republican governors to support the front-runner . <p> Engler 's policy was possibly not the best way to try out for the No. 2 spot on the ticket . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the governor had a chance to make that decision again , " " maybe " he would do it differently . And by Thursday he had found a way , getting the Republican Governors Association as a group to back Dole - something most of its members had already done individually . <p> Although Dole contends he has n't given the choice of a running mate serious consideration , he may have his heart set on Powell , if only because recent polls show that while Dole would lose to President Clinton , a Dole-Powell ticket would win . <p> Dole tipped his hand in a recent CBS interview saying Powell has been a lifelong soldier , and " " I believe if anyone went to him . . . laid out a case . . . he would suit up again . " If Powell accepted , Dole probably would be willing to live with the storm that would create on the Republican right , especially among opponents of Powell 's views favoring abortion rights . <p> But Powell associates contend there is no certainty he would agree to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mate who fits his already enunciated criteria : being prepared to assume the presidency in case of an emergency and sharing his overall philosophy . <p> Like Dole , both Engler and Voinovich are generally conservative and oppose abortion , which would cut down on friction that Dole 's selection of a more moderate running mate would draw from Pat Buchanan and his supporters . Both are Roman Catholics , in contrast to Dole 's solid Protestant background , and come from states that Clinton carried in 1992 and will again be battlegrounds in the fall campaign . <p> Both men , also like Dole , have been in elective office most of their adult lives . <p> Engler , from a farm family in central Michigan , ran for the state House while he was a student at Michigan State in 1971 and has been in the capitol ever since . <p> Voinovich , from an ethnic neighborhood in Cleveland , became an assistant state attorney general two years out of Ohio State , then had Cuyahoga County elective jobs before becoming Republican mayor of his solidly Democratic hometown throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different in some ways on which Dole might want to reflect . <p> Both men are younger than the 72-year-old Dole , but Engler , 47 , would provide a starker generational contrast than Voinovich , 59 . <p> Engler might more easily fill the vice-presidential candidate 's traditional assignment as hatchet man - a role Dole played all too well on the losing 1976 Republican ticket with President Ford . Engler has been known as a fierce Republican scrapper since his days as a GOP leader in the Michigan Legislature . <p> " " They say he 's so partisan , " countered Engler spokesman Truscott . " " But really it 's because he 's so smart " and masters the parliamentary and procedural mechanics in order to defeat Democrats . <p> Voinovich , by contrast , is better known as a nice guy . <p> After extolling Voinovich as " " a very fine human being , " Al Tuchfarber , a political scientist at the University of Cincinnati , said , " " but the downside is he 's not a particularly dynamic campaigner . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not at all glib . " <p> While both governors have been tough on spending , especially welfare outlays , Engler has been more ruthless and more willing to see the savings be used for tax cuts . <p> More cautiously , Voinovich insists that Ohio sit on its approximately $ 1 billion surplus as a " " rainy day fund . " Early in his first term , an economic downturn led Voinovich to seek limited revenue increases , leading the Wall Street Journal to lable him " " the nation 's premier GOP tax raiser , " not the kind of charge Republicans would like to see in a Democratic ad in October . <p> Ed Sarpolus of Michigan Researchers Associates contends that Engler has not been as courageous on the fiscal front as supporters argue . <p> " " He has never taken money from people who could fight back or who vote , " Sarpolus said of Engler 's emphasis on cutting welfare rolls . " " The toughness has never been with anybody who counts . " <p> But Sarpolus admires Engler 's political skills , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintains solid contacts with and gets strong support from moderate Republican women who favor abortion rights , and have deserted other conservative GOP candidates . <p> Another goal in picking a running mate is to avoid selecting a candidate who might add trouble to the ticket . <p> While neither Engler nor Voinovich has been implicated in major scandals , there are a few clouds in the Michigander 's resume . <p> As he was securing a separation and divorce from his first wife , Engler had what might be called an active social life , leading to the same sort of rumors about womanizing that have plagued Clinton . But Engler has remarried , and supporters argue his new role as father to triplets should assuage any concerns . <p> Unlike Dole , who was seriously injured in World War II , neither Engler nor Voinovich has a military record . And Engler 's lack of service has become newsworthy recently in Michigan . <p> Although Engler said in a 1994 campaign debate that he avoided service in Vietnam with a student deferment , the Detroit Free Press revealed earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two draft physicals and failed them both because he was two pounds overweight .
