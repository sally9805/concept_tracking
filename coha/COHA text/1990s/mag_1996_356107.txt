Fate sometimes provides by taking away . For six years , Zoran Djindjic backed nearly every idea , every group and every trend that might lessen the absolute hold on power enjoyed by his country 's imperious , corrupt and autocratic President , Slobodan Milosevic . But the despotic leader stood unbowed and seemingly unconquerable . Relentless in his quest , Djindjic decided to run for mayor of Serbia 's capital , Belgrade . Three weeks ago , to the astonishment of many observers , he won . Then , to no one 's real surprise , Milosevic reacted to his party 's stunning defeat by ordering the courts to annul the election , in which 14 other city halls were also taken by opposition politicians . For Djindjic , the move to crush his victory at last gave him his moment . <P> Tens of thousands of students , intellectuals and elderly citizens had poured into the streets of downtown Belgrade to celebrate their election victory when , on Nov. 21 , the court rulings turned their joy to outrage . In an afternoon ritual that showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with snowballs , eggs and paper airplanes while serenading his government 's empty office windows with catcalls , whistles , kazoos and jeers . Prominent among them was Djindjic , 44 , his charisma , intellect and charm suddenly allowed full play in what had become not only a Serbian theater but also a world forum . Foreigners were even learning to pronounce his name ( the dj sounds like the g in ginger ) . By last week the remarkable display had some crowd watchers looking for signs of similarity with the Tiananmen Square protests and with earlier successful popular uprisings in central and eastern Europe . <P> Now unmistakable in his black turtleneck and soft tweed jacket , the former university professor had been until recently but one among many voices in the cacophonous crowd of Zajedno ( Together ) , a coalition whose members were united only by their opposition to Milosevic . Zajedno 's potpourri included everything from strident Serb nationalists whose hard-line politics are as autocratic as Milosevic 's , to liberals infatuated with Western democracy . Plagued by disunity , backstabbing and factional feuds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was in charge , much less what policies to pursue . Now the huge rallies have given them at least a physical pursuit , even if a unifying philosophy is still a distant dream . <P> " Anyone in politics must have his priorities , " Djindjic told TIME last week . " My priority is to have support in Serbia . The other is to have support in the West . " An impish smile spread across his face . " Sometimes , " he added , " these priorities conflict . " <P> For the moment , however , there are the protests . Over the past three weeks , the demonstrators seemed to be simultaneously flinging a gauntlet in the face of a hated regime and giddily indulging in a long-overdue chance to lampoon it . They banged spoons on plates to emphasize the depth of Serbia 's economic malaise . They marched in front of the state-run TV network holding their noses " because the lies stink so much . " They sprayed parliament with detergent ( to symbolize the need to clean up corruption ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean , the crowd 's numbers  --  and boldness  --  burgeoned with each passing day .
