Planning a trip ? You 'll be happy to know that Pan Am , American and Northwest airlines have drastically cut fares for travelers buying tickets before March 1 . British Airways would like to cut transatlantic fares one-third , and TWA , USAir and Pan Am want to cut them that much or more , if the government lets them . Air carriers are offering dramatic bargains  --  and not out of benevolence . They 're desperate . <P> In 1990 , their all-time worst year , the world 's airlines lost a record $3.5 billion and nearly half their passenger traffic to the threat of war and the pain of recession , and they figured things could n't get any worse . They were wrong . With bombs falling in the Middle East and the world economy almost motionless , this year is shaping up as an even bigger disaster . From passenger airlines to aircraft makers , the aviation business is in a tailspin . Losses and failures are mounting , planes are flying half empty , and the transatlantic fare war is certain to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Airline Economics : " This is the most serious crisis in the history of the airline business . " <P> The crisis signals an end to a decade of unprecedented expansion . Passenger travel , which soared to record levels in the aftermath of deregulation , is paralyzed by corporate belt-tightening and fear of terrorism . So far this year , international traffic is down 40% . In the U.S. 2 of every 5 seats are flying empty . As the war and the recession roll on , carriers are lightening their loads by suspending unprofitable routes , flying remaining ones less often and cutting costs . Airlines have reduced new orders for aircraft as much as 50% ; 44,000 airline workers worldwide , from machinists in Kansas City to flight attendants in Amsterdam , have lost their jobs since January . USAir , which reported $221 million in losses for the fourth quarter , last week laid off 3,600 workers . Belgium 's national airline , Sabena , and Spain 's flagship carrier , Iberia , each announced plans to eliminate more than 2,000 jobs . British Airways , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4,600 jobs while mothballing five Boeing planes worth $1.5 billion . <P> Even before Iraq invaded Kuwait , America 's stalling economy was forcing the U.S. industry to consolidate . With passenger revenues slowing , the airlines separated into two groups : healthy carriers with strong balance sheets , like American , United and Delta , and those weighed down by excessive debt from buyouts and overexpansion , such as Pan Am , Eastern , TWA and Continental . To remain aloft , the weaker carriers sold routes , planes and other assets piecemeal to their stronger competitors , widening the chasm . Desperate for cash , Pan Am offered its London routes to United for $290 million , while financially troubled TWA agreed to unload its Heathrow landing rights to American for $445 million .
