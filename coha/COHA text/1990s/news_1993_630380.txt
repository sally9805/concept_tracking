<p> The door to Ivo Grbic 's art gallery and home attracts immediate attention . Unlike the usual elegant white stone facades that give Dubrovnik its gorgeous Renaissance unity , his entranceway is boarded up and covered with red and black script , with a large , demonic-looking emblem over the portal . <p> I ask two onlookers who are chatting back and forth in English ( and Serbo-Croatian ) if they know what it all means . It turns out that Drazen and Marko Prelec are Croatian-American brothers  --  one a professor at M.I.T. , the other a history student about to begin a Fulbright in Zagreb . They prove to be a rich source of information . <p> " This is a quote from a famous Croatian dramatist of the 16th century , a writer like Rabelais or Shakespeare , " they explain . " It is a very descriptive passage about how wicked people , described as monkeys , parrots , mongrels and barbarians full of warts , came to these parts and mingled and multiplied among the genuine people . " <p> Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war in the former Yugoslavia . <p> Luckily , the artist himself , a 62-year-old imp , invites us in for a look . And one glance explains his indignation . Except for an unsupported stairway leading to nowhere , Grbic 's great stone townhouse was completely gutted by fire bombs and shells dropped in December , 1991 . <p> The roofless building now provides little protection for what has become a sort of unofficial installation site filled with cabinets displaying the remnants of his life . They include several of the mortars and shells that fell on his house on this centrally located Dubrovnik street , along with burnt leaves arranged in bundles and wreaths , fire-crisped family tools , a pair of binoculars , and shards of majolica apothecary jars . <p> Grbic is clearly a little bit in love with his ruin ; the artist in him has tapped the potential for transformation in this situation and turned tragedy into creative fodder . In a sense , that is what everyone in Dubrovnik has done . And that is why the jewel of the Adriatic  --  which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a medieval walled city in the world  --  seems well on its way to recovery . <p> The war between the Serbs and the Croats was not supposed to happen here . Just as in World War II , when treasured sites in Florence , Italy , and the ancient city of Kyoto in Japan found some measure of protection from bombing , everyone assumed that Dubrovnik  --  high on the list of UNESCO 's designated " world heritage " treasures , and of no strategic importance  --  would be spared . <p> Nevertheless , the Yugoslav Army attacked the Dubrovnik region from the autumn of 1991 through the spring of 1992  --  with Dec. 6 , 1991 , going down as the day of infamy when the famous Old Town was most brutally smashed and set afire . <p> Nearly every building and street in the city was scarred by rifle-launched grenades , shells and guided missiles . By the time the assault was over , nine Renaissance palaces had been burned , hundreds of other structures were severely damaged and 60 percent of the city 's distinctive red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monetary terms , which is by no means the correct measure here , was set at $ 2.6 billion . <p> Further complicating the damage was the fact that water and electricity were turned off in the city for many months , making life for residents who could not or would not leave , both mentally and physically debilitating . Dubrovnik , after all , had been one of the world 's most sparkling tourist destinations  --  the Venice of the Dalmatian Coast and a place where artists , shopkeepers and all those in the tourist-related trades lived an idyllic and quite prosperous existence . <p> Even before the actual bombing , the city was suffering economically . By June , 1991 , when a friend and I stopped in Dubrovnik on the way back from a trip through Eastern Europe , it was practically devoid of the usual tourist hordes  --  a financial nightmare for a place that until then had received 80 percent of its income from tourism and related businesses . <p> The reports and photographs of the destruction of Dubrovnik were so horrible that I could barely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this August , when I received an invitation from the Rebuild Dubrovnik Fund in Washington , D.C. , I jumped at the chance to see the city firsthand . What I found was both heartening and heartbreaking . <p> At first glance , Dubrovnik 's Old Town seems to be very much as I remembered it . The grime of war has been scrubbed away ; rooftops have been patched up , at least temporarily ; sidewalk cafes and gelato shops are open for business , and daily life percolates inside the apartments that line the streets and steep stairways of the Old Town . <p> Many of the major buildings on the Stradun or main street  --  from the 18th century baroque centerpiece , St. Blaise 's church , and the magnificent 16th century Sponza Palace , to the Franciscan monastery with its lovely interior garden  --  are wrapped in scaffolding and wood and protected by sandbags . Some of this is to shore up structural damage ; some of it is precautionary . <p> Many Dubrovnik hotels ( all but one , now closed , lie outside the Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Restaurant owners boast that the fish supply has never been better ( fewer tourists mean richer waters if poorer waiters ) . And the Dubrovnik Summer Festival , once an international showcase of opera , dance and music , is valiantly trying to re-establish itself , though this year it featured only local talent . <p> So what is missing from this picture ? Just one thing : people . <p> For the moment at least , Dubrovnik and the Dalamatian Coast seem entirely safe . But attracting tourists to a country where there is even a rumor of war is tremendously difficult ( though Europeans long familiar with the city are just beginning to return ) . <p> For the seasoned traveler , of course , this may be the perfect time to visit : Prices are down , the city is still a beauty , and you can stroll its streets or walk atop its massive , milelong fortress walls virtually free of " the madding crowd . " <p> Whatever the city 's immediate future , there is the feeling that having survived , the inhabitants of Dubrovnik @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the exception until the war  --  are now determined to prevail . They appear determined to do everything in their power to reignite tourism . <p> You can feel it in the way the women of the city tell stories of bathing and washing their clothes in the salty water of the Adriatic in an effort to remain attractive even when the water was cut off . You can sense it in the way a neatly dressed man now tries to keep up appearances while nursing the single cup of espresso he can afford in his favorite cafe . <p> You can hear it in the voice of Zvonimir Franic , a young architect who works for the Institute for Preservation of Architectural Monuments . " In 15 years Dubrovnik will be fully restored , " Franic predicts . " And as soon as we get tourism back , we will earn the money we need to do the job ourselves . " <p> You can sense it in the spirit of Denis Ajdukovic , a 23-year-old classical musician who earns money working as a first mate on the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where bombing has now given way to picnics . <p> Sitting with several friends in the Troubador Cafe , a popular hangout for artists , Ajdukovic spoke in flawless English of how the Dubrovnik Symphony Orchestra 's palace home was destroyed , and how he and his fellow musicians are now giving concerts in a hotel ballroom , charging 50 cents per ticket . <p> But nowhere was the spirit of Dubrovnik 's rebirth more palpable than among the huge local crowd that turned out for the final night of performances at the summer music festival , staged in front of St. Blaise 's church . <p> The most riveting performer was Ibrica Jusic , a singer and guitarist whose fiery songs of love and war suggested he was this city 's answer to Jacques Brel or Charles Aznavour . Jusic , a middle-aged balladeer , has been the closing act at the festival for 30 years , and as he mesmerized his audience on that perfect , starlit August night , the scars of war that marred Dubrovnik by day seemed to magically disappear . <p> NEXT SUNDAY : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plus more of Croatia . @x WE WERE TOLD IT WAS THE first time Mike Wallace had ever apologized to an elected official on air on 60 Minutes . For all I know , it still might be the only time . And 15 years later , in this age of Obama when the establishment media is hostile to conservatives , the episode still can teach lessons about how to fight back with the truth . If the story is straight enough , there do remain honest liberal reporters and columnists who will come to your aid . The year was 1993. 1 was working as a press secretary for U.S. Rep. Bob Livingston , of Louisiana , a strongly pro-military but carefully budget-cutting veteran of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee . Our top legislative aide , Paul Cambon , told me that 60 Minutes had been snooping around a small medical-research project back in Louisiana funded through a military grant . The medical researcher was seeking better ways to treat brain injuries of the sort soldiers often suffer . The problem , Cambon said , was that the researcher 's thesis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , as I best recall , with how some brain injuries that otherwise would not be deadly could cause the heart to stop beating . The idea- again , this is from memory- was to show that emergency medical personnel should work just as fast to ensure and stabilize respiration as they do to treat the site of the head injury itself . Cambon told me , though , that other specialists had informed him that these same findings had already been proved nearly a full century before , in the late 1890s . Meanwhile , this particular research was drawing protests because- get this- the doctor 's method involved repeatedly shooting cats in the head with BB pellets . The cats would be placed in a head vise so the doctor could precisely aim the pellets , and then. , . Boom ! Then he 'd study the results . Animal rights activists , for obvious reasons , were outraged . And since this research was being funded by the U.S. government , in Livingston 's backyard , through the military over which Livingston 's subcommittee had jurisdiction ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's direction . Again , this was shooting cats , on the taxpayer dime . Oddly enough , though , 60 Minutes was n't interested in blasting Livingston for allowing the cat shooting . The TV show was n't outraged that the goal of this cat shooting reportedly was to prove something already understood for 95 years . Instead , 60 Minutes wanted to know why Livingston was not supporting the cat-shooting experiments . The news magazine 's staff seemed to assume that soldiers ' lives would be dependent on this one scientist 's experiments . What Livingston had done , as a careful appropriator , was pretty standard stuff . In the most recent military funding bill , he had inserted language suspending that project 's grant until the research could be scientifically peer-reviewed . He did n't kill the project entirely . He just caused a pause so he could learn if the experiments actually had real military/ medical usefulness . If not , then it was both a waste of taxpayer money and outrageous cruelty . For whatever reason , 60 Minutes was lining up with the cat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CBS News producer was related to somebody close to the scientist . ) All we knew was that the show 's snoopers seemed intent on a morality play in which a purportedly pro-military congressman was blocking research that could save soldiers ' lives . Bizarre . ANYWAY , CAMBON 'S INFORMATION proved accurate . A 60 Minutes assistant producer finally contacted our office directly . To this day , I can remember the attitude : aggressive , imperious , accusatory . No matter what I said about how a temporary suspension of the cat shooting was just simple common sense , it fell on deaf ears . A Republican congressman was in the show 's sights- oddly enough , not for being too heartless , but for supposedly pandering to touchy-feely animal rights extremists . And the producer was demanding an on-camera interview with Livingston . I drew on my experience as a research assistant for a widely used text on journalistic ethics , The Virtuous Journalist by Stephen Klaidman and Tom Beauchamp , in which CBS News and 60 Minutes had been used in several case studies of what not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right to have our own camera tape any interview ourselves , so we could have irrefutable evidence if the show unfairly spliced several interview segments together , out of context , to make him look bad . Livingston declined . He had nothing to hide , he said . Tell the producer he would gladly do the interview-as long as it was aired either live or entirely unedited . Pre-taped and edited , no . Live or fulllength , fine . I called the producer back with our terms . She laughed nastily . She said Fd regret it . I went to work . With Cambon 's help , I gathered every conceivable document on the cat project . I spent days putting together pages of evidence showing that everything we were doing was prudent , unremarkable , fair to both sides , and representative of good fiscal stewardship . I then offered the report to the producer . She scoffed . Some days later , CBS star Mike Wallace himself called me . He pretended to be my buddy . It was a tough act to carry off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a faux-avuncular voice , Wallace said almost these exact words : " Look , how old are you ? .... Just 28 ? Well , let me give you some advice . You seem like a smart young man . But let me tell you what I 've learned in 50 years in this business . What I 've learned is that you 're always better off answering all the questions . And you 're always better off if you cooperate with people who have a lot more experience than you . There 's a good reason why I and 60 Minutes have such an excellent reputation . Just cooperate with us , and you 'll be just fine . " Gee , how nice . I reiterated our terms . Live and unedited , or no dice . Wallace was n't happy . He said he never agreed to terms like that , " not even for Henry Kissinger . " He demanded that Livingston call him . Long story short , Livingston did call back . But only after I was set up to record the phone call , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record one 's own phone calls . ) If 60 Minutes could do some of the ambush jobs it was known for , we darn well would ensure that we were protected . On the phone with Wallace , Livingston repeated his terms , including , quite explicitly , his offer to go on camera if his conditions were met ; he also outlined his concerns about the tenor of the show 's investigation . Wallace tried repeatedly to change Livingston 's mind . He reiterated his line about Kissinger- and said he would n't agree to those terms for the pope or the president either . Livingston would n't budge , and encouraged Wallace to read the report I had written . Wallace was furious . A MONTH or so later , after we sent a certified letter repeating our concerns about the story 's directions and Livingston 's offer to go on camera live or unedited , the segment on the catshooting finally aired . As expected , it was a hit job . It made the scientist sound like a saintly Albert Schweitzer . It made the protesters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Livingston 's safe seat , sound more extreme than Greenpeace . Worse , it used footage of animal rights activists in high lather who were protesting some other subject at some other place- but with a voice-over making it seem like these were the protesters against the cat project . The deliberate impression was to make Livingston sound like a scared congressman pandering , fearfully , to those protesters . Oh- and Wallace said , on air , that he had repeatedly offered Livingston a chance to discuss the situation , but that Livingston refused . Not , mind you , that Livingston had offered to be interviewed live or unedited , but instead as if Livingston had totally ducked all questions . The next day , Livingston called Wallace and chewed him out . Again , my tape was running , again secretly . Said Wallace : " One way in which you 're dead right , and I apologize to you for it and I do n't know how the hell it got through , and that 's the business of , ah , not saying ' live and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to go on camera to tell us .... My friend , I apologize to you , I really do . I 'm ashamed of myself because you told it to me . ... It 's unfair . Because you were perfectly willing to go on .. .. That was just dishonest of me , and that was stupid of me . " Livingston told Wallace that if he had to choose again what to do about the cat-shooting research , he " would have done it exactly the same way . " Responded Wallace : " I do n't disagree with you . " I went to work . I produced a 27-page , footnoted , single-spaced refutation of the entire 60 Minutes report . Fact after fact , citation after citation ( including the misleading protester footage ) , I laid out the blatant dishonesty . I sent it to 60 Minutes demanding a retraction . I sent it out to a bunch of reporters . And I noted ( without mentioning our audiotapes ) that Wallace had lied when he said we had refused to cooperate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the private phone call . Amazingly enough , 60 Minutes re-ran the segment in July . With no corrections . Not one . THIS TIME , we called the president of CBS News . Bob played our audiotape for him . And then played it again . There was Wallace apologizing and admitting to having been " dishonest " and " stupid . " And yet the show had run again , without correction . It was clear we had a slam-dunk legal case if we wanted to press it . The CBS president was irate at his own team . He made that clear . The tape did the trick . Apparently the news president then came down hard on Wallace . Really hard . Wallace soon called back . His voice was shaky . " Well , urn , you know something ? You 're a better man than I am , Congressman . " He promised to go on the air and apologize to the entire country . Then , after more of what can only be described as groveling , Wallace said this : " You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me you had a tape recorder going ; that would have been the gentlemanly thing to do , the first time .... " Livingston interrupted , lowering the boom : " It would have been , but then I did n't think that I was necessarily dealing with a gentleman . " Wallace : " Well , in any case ... " Livingston : " And frankly , you 've proven me right . " Bingo . You could almost hear the phone line sizzle . Wallace had no answer . There was no good answer . Livingston was correct . Yes , Wallace did apologize on the air- not for a whole host of other falsehoods that I had detailed , but for saying Livingston had flat-out refused to be interviewed on camera . But the apology was clear , unambiguous . It left no wiggle room . We now had it , on TV , that Wallace had wronged Livingston . And the apology for one part of the report had the same effect as an apology for all of it . Columnists and radio hosts , all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington Post 's famous peacenik Colman McCarthy , a man who ordinarily would agree with Livingston on nothing , was especially strong . His thorough , concise , and eloquent column called Livingston an " honorable " congressman who had done the right thing throughout . ONE NOTE , THOUGH , about the McCarthy piece . It was the only one that really covered all the other dishonesties in the 60 Minutes report . It was the only one that made real use of my 27-page manifesto . A number of journalists defended Livingston , but only McCarthy really explained the underlying dispute . The one thing that drew the attention of the rest of them was the simple , straight apology , based on the original simple , straightforward demand that a TV show not splice an interview out of context . I , the press aide , had forgotten the nature of the press . But Livingston remembered : Keep it simple . Keep it straight . Keep it absolutely clear . And play it smart by collecting evidence that can not possibly be denied . Conservatives today are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a press that treats President Barack Obama as a savior . Witness 60 Minutes itself , both last December and in March , dropping its usual hardball tactics and offering a friendly forum to Obama with nothing but puffball questions . In contrast , Obama 's critics come off as obstructionist trolls . In fighting those media tactics , conservatives all too often forget the same lessons I forgot . They were the lessons of concision and clarity that Ronald Reagan always taught . They are lessons that conservatives will need if they want to get their message out and make it stick- because , when dealing with the establishment media , we are n't necessarily dealing with gentlemen .
