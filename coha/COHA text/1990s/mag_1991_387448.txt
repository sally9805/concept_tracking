The civil rights bill 's loopholes ? <p> Last week 's agreement on a compromise civil rights bill won virtually everything that civil rights advocates first sought two years ago : the legislative reversal of six Supreme Court decisions on employment discrimination . What is especially fascinating to those who have watched the long struggle to produce a bill is how the agreement treats the most contested issue , the disparate impact approach to proving discrimination . <p> Under that approach , established by the Supreme Court in Griggs v. Duke Power Company but gutted by the Court in the 1989 case Wards Cove v. Atonio , an employment practice may be actionable discrimination if it has a more adverse effect on certain groups than others , whether or not discriminatory intent produced the effect . In the new compromise , agreement on this thorny matter was made possible by a number of textual ambiguities , with the various parties hoping they had laid the groundwork for favorable Court interpretations in the future . Indeed , although the new bill is most plausibly read as a major victory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test , one can see in the final deal a bid by administration lawyers to give the Supreme Court a handle for reading the act narrowly . <p> The new agreement provides that once plaintiffs show a disparate impact , the employer must " demonstrate that the challenged practice is job related for the position in question and consistent with business necessity . " Thus the two main goals of those who sought to reverse Wards Cove seem to be achieved . First , the employer , not the plaintiff , has the burden of proving whether there 's enough justification for an employment practice having a disparate impact . Second , the employer 's burden is strict : the . employer must show that all job selection criteria having a disparate impact are related to the performance of the job in question , not simply to vaguely defined business goals . <p> This second requirement represents a flat-out rejection of the administration 's core legal position . The administration has long argued that employers should be allowed to justify hiring standards where they predict better job performance or promote other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position : job qualification standards must be job-related . Indeed , the " or " in the administration 's proposal has become an " and "  --  the new agreement provides that the employer must show not only that the practice is " job related for the position in question " but also " consistent with business necessity . " Although it 's not certain what that second phrase adds in this context , civil rights lawyers will surely argue that it must mean something , and that it imposes an extra requirement on employers causing disparate impacts . The most plausible reading is that whereas the first phrase requires that the qualification standard be related to the job , the second phrase ( " consistent with business necessity " ) addresses the nature of the required relationship and insists that the relationship to the job be a substantial one . ( The language is listed word-for-word from the Americans with Disabilities Act , which has been interpreted to mean roughly this . ) <p> But the meaning of this new language is n't as certain as it might have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was secured , as compromises often are , by introducing new ambiguities into the bill . Prior to the agreement with the president , the Danforth bill had spelled out the disparate impact test in much greater detail . Where once there were several hundred words , now there are eighteen . The greater clarity of the prior Danforth proposal was " pro-employer " in some respects , since it gave more explicit leeway to employers than the new compromise ( for , example , it explicitly allowed employers to screen for " behavior " that was n't actual job performance and to hire with an eye to a future class of jobs the employee might hold ; the new compromise does n't mention these things ) . But the old version also had some clearer " pro-plaintiff " features as well , putting more explicit restrictions on employers trying to justify their selection criteria ( for example , not any relationship to the job would do ; the employer would have to show a " manifest relationship " ) . These issues will now have to be hammered out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example of new ambiguities are the small but telling revisions in the preamble of the bill . The old Danforth proposal provided that one purpose of the act is TABLE <p> The new language provides that the purpose of the bill is TABLE <p> The administration strongly pushed for this change , which does two main things : it avoids saying flatly that Wards Cove 's interpretation of " business necessity " is overruled , and it indicates that an entire line of cases beginning with Griggs is codified , not simply Griggs itself . The administration undoubtedly hopes to use this modification when litigating how the new act should be interpreted , and to use it to support the following argument : One pre-Wards Cove opinion suggests that job selection criteria may be justified in terms of business goals other than actual job performance , and another indicates that qualification standards need only have a loose relationship to the employment in question . Since the new act codifies " decisions prior to Wards Cove , " the argument will go , the act codifies the language in these two decisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plurality of the Court , and may not even qualify as a Court " decision . " ) <p> There are , of course , strong answers to these arguments based on the preamble : the operative provisions of the act seem clearly to require that selection criteria be related to performance in the job position being filled , and to negate any suggestion that the relationship may be a weak one . But an ambiguity has been created , and by design . The administration 's opposition to earlier versions of the bill has long rested not simply on a political calculation but also on serious policy concerns about the impact test ( see " Discrimination Endgame , " TNR , August 12 ) . White House lawyers are undoubtedly hoping they have put enough into the new act to persuade the courts , when they interpret the act , that it codifies a relatively weak version of the test . <p> It 's doubtful , I think , that a court reading the act in good faith will see the last-minute modification of the preamble as blunting the force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all parties to the recent negotiations obviously appreciated , the Supreme Court , which has the final power to interpret any new civil rights laws , has already shown itself to be very cautious in endorsing broad civil rights protections . ( The new law , of course , was necessitated by the Court 's very narrow interpretation of existing legislation . ) <p> The Court 's narrow approach to civil rights laws is part of a more general approach to statutory interpretation emerging on the Court . Under the leadership of Antonin Scalia , the Court has insisted that Congress must speak with distinctive clarity before the Court will find enforceable statutory rights . Extending rights , Scalia emphasizes , means augmented judicial power , interference with people 's liberty , and defining some social relationships in adversarial , rights-based terms . Statutory ambiguity , for Scalia , means that Congress has not done its work , has not agreed upon the scope of rights . Therefore , he will interpret ambiguous congressional statutes as not creating rights or creating rights of only the narrowest scope  --  rather than fill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light of a statute 's basic purposes , as judges have commonly done . <p> Fortunately for Supporters of the disparate impact test , the new civil rights bill is sufficiently clear that the Court will probably agree that Congress has enacted a strong version of the test . But uncertainties do exist , as the White House and others surely intended . And it will be years before we learn from the Court precisely what the act has come to mean . <p> By Paul Gewirtz , Professor of law at Yale Law School . <p>
