Shortly after midnight on Dec. 18 , just five days after the shuttle Endeavour returned from the daring mission to repair the Hubble telescope , scientists secretly put the refurbished instrument to its first test . They ordered the Hubble to point toward a bright star and beam its image to Earth . Anxiously , they crowded around a computer screen at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore , Maryland , as they waited for the picture to appear . The Endeavour astronauts had installed the telescope 's corrective lenses and other equipment perfectly . But it was n't certain that the devices would actually work . As the star 's image came up on the screen , the scientists stared for a second  --  then burst into cheers . The Hubble , hobbled for nearly four years by an improperly ground mirror , was going to be as good as new . <P> In fact , said ASA administrator Daniel Goldin , presenting the first images from the born-again telescope at a press conference last week , " it 's better than new . The telescope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the repairs . " Its eyesight is so sharp , say scientists , that if it were sitting in Washington , it could spot a firefly in Tokyo . <P> That 's not hard to believe , considering the before and after pictures NASA unveiled . Blurred blobs have turned into sharp , clean images of galaxies , super-novas and stars . But , says senior project scientist David Leckrone , " these are the very first test images . We 're not pushing the telescope to its limits yet . " As they do , scientists will almost certainly be able to start solving some of astronomy 's greatest mysteries : How old is the universe ? Do giant black holes lurk at the cores of galaxies ? How did the galaxies get formed ? Are there planets circling other stars ? And besides searching for those answers , the Hubble will treat astronomers to a clear , close view of a space spectacular in July : the collision between comet Shoemaker-Levy 1993e and Jupiter .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
