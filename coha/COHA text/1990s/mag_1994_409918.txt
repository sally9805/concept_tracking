I began observing dogs by accident . While friends spent six months in Europe , I took care of their husky , Misha . An agreeable two-year-old Siberian with long , thin legs and short , thick hair , Misha could jump most fences and travel freely . He jumped our fence the day i took him in . As Misha violated the leash law in our city I would receive complaints about him , and with the help of these complaints I was soon able to establish that he had developed a range of approximately 130 square miles . Much larger than the ranges of homeless dogs reported in Baltimore by the scientist Alan Beck , Misha 's range more closely resembled the 200-to 500-square-mile territories roamed by wolves . What was Misha doing ? Obviously , something unusual . Here was a dog who , despite his youth , could navigate flawlessly , finding his way to and from all corners of the city of Cambridge , Massachusetts , by day and night . Here was a dog who could evade dangerous traffic and escape the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice on the Charles River , who never touched the poison baits set out for raccoons , who was never mauled by other dogs . Misha always came back from his journeys feeling fine , ready for a light meal and a rest before going out again . How did he do it ? For a while I looked for the answer in journals and books , but I found nothing : Despite a vast array of publications on dogs , virtually nobody , neither scientist nor layman , had ever bothered to ask what dogs do when left to themselves . At first , that science had ignored the question seemed amazing . But was it really ? We tend to study animals for what they can teach us about ourselves or for facts that we can turn to our advantage . But dogs have shared our lives for 20,000 years . How then had we managed to learn so little about them that we could not answer the simplest question : What do they want ? Our ignorance becomes more blame-worthy when we consider that no animal could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not afraid of us . To study them we need not invade their habitat or imprison them in ours  --  our world is their natural habitat and always was . Furthermore , because their wild ancestors were not dogs at all but wolves , dogs have never even existed as a wild species . Hence , curled on the sofa beside me was a creature of mystery  --  an agreeable dog with a life of his own that he had no wish to conceal and that he was managing with all the competence of a wild animal , not with any help from human beings but in spite of them . One evening he got up and stretched , preparatory to voyaging . First he braced his hind legs and stretched backward , head bowed , rump high , to pull tight the muscles of his shoulders . Then he raised his head and dropped his hips to stretch his spine and hind legs , even clenching his feet into fists so that the stretch went into his toes . Ready at last , he moved calmly toward the door so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . As our eyes met , I had an inspiration : Misha himself would answer my questions . Right in front of me , a long-neglected gate to the animal kingdom seemed waiting to be opened . Misha held the key . Who could resist the appeal of this notion ? No money , no travel , no training , no special instruments were necessary to probe the mystery  --  one needed only a dog , a notebook , and a pencil . I did n't even regret my total lack of formal training to begin such a project . In fact , I did n't feel I 'd be ignorant for long . I opened the door a crack . Out slipped Misha , with me right behind him , and thus our project began . The first question , perhaps the most important , I was never able to answer . This was the question of Misha 's navigational skills . Sometimes he seemed to travel without the use of landmarks , since once he had arrived at his destination , he might easily take another route home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun ? Did he see polarized light ? Did he use odors floating in the air , as fish use the taste of currents in sea water ? I did n't know , and could learn nothing by watching his sure trot , his confident demeanor . To probe more deeply would have required an experiment  --  blindfolding him , say , and taking him to some distant release point . But that was n't the nature of our relationship . I did learn two things , though , about Misha 's navigational ability . The first was that his skills were probably not innate , or not entirely so . If they had been , other huskies should have shared them . But I knew others who could not navigate . One was Misha 's wife , Maria . When they were together , Misha established the route for both of them , and not easily , because she , young and enthusiastic , would go bounding ahead of him , often in the wrong direction , requiring him to overtake her . Then , by jumping at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder to make her turn . The second was that although he made his way faultlessly through the city , his technique did n't necessarily apply in the country , especially if he had n't reached the starting point on his own . If I took the dogs with me when I went to visit relatives , and if the dogs then went voyaging , Misha was n't always able to lead Maria back to my relatives ' home . Perhaps he felt less sure of himself in unfamiliar surroundings . Whatever the reason , if both got lost in the country , they would use Maria 's technique for getting home and wait on someone 's doorstep for me to show up in the car . Another important skill of Misha 's was his management of traffic . No car so much as touched Misha , who , like a civil engineer , had divided the streets and their traffic into categories and had developed different strategies to deal with each . The worst and most dangerous areas were congestions of multidirectional traffic , and these Misha completely avoided . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of them , he simply went around it . The second category was composed of a few limited-access highways where the heavy traffic was especially dangerous . Misha could n't avoid the highways and still go where he wanted , so , adopting a humble attitude , he approached the cars with diplomacy and tact in an attempt to appease them . Perhaps not surprisingly , many dogs treat cars as if they were animate . Dogs who chase cars evidently see them as large , unruly ungulates badly in need of discipline and shepherding , and ca n't help trying to control them . But Misha did n't chase cars . He well understood that they could be tremendously dangerous , especially when they seemed to be acting angrily and willfully , as they did on the limited-access highways . So he offered them respect . At the edge of the highway Misha would stand humbly , his head and tail low , his eyes half shut , his ears politely folded . But the moment the cars became few , Misha 's humility would vanish . His ears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , the very picture of confidence . Over the highway he would skip , and go happily on his way . Never while I was observing him did I hear a scream of tires . Sometimes , though , he would lose me beside a limited-access highway . I lacked his courage , also his speed and skill , and I usually had to wait much longer than he did before the traffic conditions met my requirements for crossing . If traffic separated us , Misha would wait for a while on the far side , but sooner or later he would assume that I had lost interest and would travel on . Later , when his traveling abated , he would find me waiting for him at home . When crossing an intersecting street , Misha used a considerably more intelligent method than his human counterparts . Unlike us , he did n't cross at the corner . Instead , he would go about 20 feet from the corner , cross there , and return on the opposite sidewalk to continue his journey . At first I could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then I saw its merits , and copied him thereafter . Why is Misha 's method safer ? Because at any point along the block , traffic comes from only two directions instead of four , as it does at the intersection . By crossing midblock , one reduces one 's chances of being hit by a turning car . Since learning this technique from Misha , I have noticed almost all free-ranging dogs do likewise . In the residential streets , Misha 's demeanor changed . Here he took no precaution about cars and never used a sidewalk , but instead moved daringly and purposefully up the middle of the street , eyes front , head and ears forward , tail up , the very picture of intent confidence . Even when he crossed an intersection , he did not alter his demeanor but kept scanning the street ahead . The trouble was that he could n't see the cars speeding toward him on the cross street . Yet , amazingly , he always escaped them . How did he manage that ? I might never have learned if both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huskies  --  stiff and upright . But they were n't . His left ear was soft at the tip when Misha was trotting along in a relaxed manner . When he was alert and tense , however , the tip would shoot up and stand stiff like that of his right ear . One day , while following Misha down a side street on the bike I had taken to using for my dogological studies , I saw his left ear stiffen as he approached an intersection . As was his custom , his eyes never left the street ahead , but the nearer he got to the intersection , the more his two ears stiffened and rotated outward , pointing sideways , so that by the time he was ready to cross ( which he always did without changing his speed or shifting his gaze ) , the cups of his ears were pointing up and down the cross street . If a car was coming , he heard it . What was more , his hearing gave the speed of the car as well as its location , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to pick up his pace or slow down , either to beat the car to the intersection or else to let it go across ahead of him . Scanning the street along which he was proceeding , never shifting his gaze to confirm what he heard coming from the sides , Misha would trot across the intersection smoothly , radiating coolness and self-confidence . Again and again we did this , at least two or three nights a week for almost two years , not stopping even after Misha 's owners came home to claim him , because by then Misha liked the work we were doing together and wanted to keep at it . Coming to collect me was not difficult for him  --  his community did not then have a leash law , so of an evening , after his owners let him out , he 'd jump their fence and make his way across two cities and a maze of traffic to find me . Usually , he would arrive just after dark . By the light on our front porch I 'd see him standing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captain looking for a sailor . One by one , dog secrets were revealed through a series of adventures , some of them dangerous , all of them interesting . Misha was Odysseus , and Cambridge was the wine-dark sea . <p>
