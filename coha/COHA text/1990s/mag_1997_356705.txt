Asia 's top female action star is new in Los Angeles , but already the locals know her as the woman who matched Jackie Chan stunt for impossible stunt in Police Story III : Super Cop . And maybe they think that punishing her body for film art  --  by , say , leaping off the top of a runaway truck to land splat ! on the hood of Chan 's speeding convertible  --  is all Michelle Yeoh does . She recalls that on one of her first L.A. photo shoots , " The beautician told me , ' You know , for a stuntwoman you have gorgeous nails . ' Well , thank you , but I 'm an actress who just happens to enjoy doing my own stunts . It 'd be nice if people could see me for what I can do . " <P> After a dozen years as the exemplary flying-fisted female of Hong Kong films , Yeoh ( also known as Michelle Kahn ) is getting the Hollywood treatment , and not just at her fingertips . Quentin Tarantino has literally knelt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oliver Stone calls Yeoh " a woman of elegance and magnificent grace  --  the young grande dame of Hong Kong cinema . " And there 's a big retrospective of Yeoh 's films ( which can also be found in specialty video stores ) this week and next at New York City 's Cinema Village Theatre . But the actress is getting more than kudos ; she 's getting work . Yeoh ( pronounced Yo ) is now filming the new James Bond epic , Tomorrow Never Comes , as 007 's partner . " I wo n't be a stereotyped Suzie Wong , " she says proudly . " With this movie we 're beginning a new generation of Bond girls . " <P> You would n't guess from her easy assurance that no Asian actress has ever become a star in big-time films in the West . But Yeoh , 34 , has always known how to handle herself . Consider the first scene in her first starring role , as a Hong Kong cop in the 1985 Yes , Madam : she walks into a library and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book shut on his offending member . She is a master of lightning kicks , splits and somersaults ; she 's also handy with firearms . A little Diaghilev , a little Dirty Harry . <P> She looks as if she 'd been born to it , or had been indentured to the Peking Opera School as a kid . Not so : Yeoh was born to dance . Raised in Malaysia by her ethnic-Chinese , English-speaking parents , Michelle pursued a dance career . She earned a B.A. at London 's Royal Academy of Dance and returned home to be crowned Miss Malaysia of 1983 . A year later she was starring in movies . <P> " Before Yes , Madam , " she says , " I did n't know any form of martial arts . But because I 'd been dancing since I was four , I was active and limber . I also had a quick mind to pick up steps and stunts . I 'd look and I 'd copy . " Putting her dance techniques in the service of movie surrealism , she executed entrechats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her plies , the knee went thwok ! in a man 's most vulnerable spot . " My stunt coordinators constantly tell me not to kick so high , " she says . " It 's not the height that matters ; it 's accuracy , power , speed . "
