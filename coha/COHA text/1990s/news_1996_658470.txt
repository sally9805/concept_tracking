<p> After she was raped at age 7 by her mother 's boyfriend , poet Maya Angelou did not speak a word for six years . Three days after the incident , the rapist had been found kicked to death . <p> " I thought my voice had killed him , so I stopped speaking , " she recalls . " I was afraid if I spoke , my voice would go out and kill people randomly ... the lady in a green dress ... the man in black shoes . " <p> Returned to the care of a nurturing grandmother who stroked her hair and shoulders and spoke of harnessing inner strengths to face the wide world , Ms. Angelou eventually started speaking again . <p> " What Granma fashioned for me was a world so wide that I could stand in any country and any company and know that everything 's perfectly all right ... I have been loved , " Angelou recalled . <p> Speaking before a national forum of leading experts on children and violence just concluded here , Angelou used her story to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home - and can be healed of it there as well . <p> " The balm which each of us needs is that village , " Angelou continued . " The village does n't necessarily have to be more than one person ... it is a nurturing condition , and it is really , at its best , love . " <p> Armed with anecdotal and statistical evidence of the past three decades , conference speakers - including the first lady , Hillary Rodham Clinton , and Gov . John Engler ( R ) of Michigan - and more than 750 attendees focused on Angelou 's premise that violence starts and stops in the home , as well as other key conclusions : that the problems of families , spouses , domestic unrest , and substance abuse are inseparable ; one-size-fits-all programs to fight against abuse and neglect of youth will fail ; and top-down solutions by centralized bureaucracies have little chance of success . <p> A national poll just released by Children 's Institute International ( CII ) , a private , nonprofit child-advocacy group that sponsored the event , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ninety percent of American teens perceive the world as getting more violent , and more than one-third say the threat of violence is everpresent in their lives . Forty-seven percent say schools are getting more violent , and 30 percent report having engaged in at least one physical fight other than with a sibling in the past year . <p> Conference participants were also spurred by the " family values " rhetoric coming out of the Democratic and Republican conventions . <p> " It was very encouraging to hear the leadership of both major political parties focus on children during their recent conventions , " said Mary Emmons , executive director of CII . " Now it 's our task to find practical ways to halt the escalating violence against children , which has exacted a terrible toll on those least able to defend themselves . " <p> Criticized for a dearth of conservative viewpoints , the forum was nonetheless lauded by participants and attendees for focusing so comprehensively on at-risk children . <p> " Twenty-five years ago , I recall talking at a conference about these issues , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , director of the Family Violence Research Program at the University of Rhode Island . " The sheer scope and interest evident today is tremendously encouraging . " <p> Warning signs <p> Experts pointed to a number of warning signs for violence . Barry Nidorf , chief probation officer for Los Angeles County , said that the younger children are when they first tangle with law enforcement , the more prone they are to repeat offenses . He also targeted kids who had problems with peer relationships , were exposed to violent , dysfunctional families , or used drugs . <p> While disputes rose over some of the proposed solutions to deal with teens ' problems , participants did agree on certain needs : <p> *Greater individual and collective will to act consistently at all levels . An emphasis is needed on individual responsibility in providing role models at home as well as working for community-based solutions - clubs , churches , social groups - rather than relying on federal , state , or local government . <p> *A collaborative approach by community leaders , neighbors , police , and social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelters for battered women that do not include facilities for treating their children , " said Carl Bell , head of the Community Mental Health Council Inc. , which serves Chicago 's poor South Side . <p> Eloise Anderson , director of the California Department of Social Services , suggested tapping into the financial and human resources of churches as well as " grandmothers ... the bedrock of any community . " <p> *Appropriate targeting of resources . " There will be families we will not be able to save , " said Peter Pecora , manager of research for the Casey Family Program and a professor of social work . " Since we have limited resources , we should concentrate them where we have a higher probability of winning . " <p> *A focus on prevention as a cost-effective approach . Studies by the RAND Corporation indicated that jailing third-time felons prevents , on average , 50 crimes to society . But the same money spent on early prevention spares society 200 crimes on average . <p> " It is more cost-effective to spend our limited funds earlier than later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ County Department of Mental Health . She also said that jails are often filled with lesser offenders who should be freed to make room for more violent offenders . <p> *A cautious approach to family reunification in cases of abuse . " We should no longer feel apologetic about placing kids in foster homes , " said Mr. Pecora . There is also renewed attention to adoption across racial lines . Some , including speaker Hillary Rodham Clinton , advocated the increased use of terminating parental rights . <p> Nicholas Scoppetta , commissioner of New York City 's Children 's Services Administration , reported a 58 percent increase in adoptions there under a new program that may become a model for the rest of the country . <p> TV 's influence <p> Participants also honed in on the pervasive influence of the media on children , presenting evidence showing that TV violence could act both as a deterrent and an inducement to copycat behavior . Some said that it was a copout by press and pundits to paint TV producers and programmers as the culprits . <p> Noting that " crime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Margaret Loesch , president of Fox Children 's Network , said , " I wish television were the problem . Then , we could fix it . " <p> Haim Saban told how his animation team for " Power Rangers , a popular children 's show often critized for being too violent , emphasized positive messages such as teamwork , " good always wins , " and the martial arts as an acceptable outlet for aggression . <p> But Douglas Besharov , a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington , said that executives had to take responsibility for negative factors as well . " If producers are willing to admit they can have a good impact , that 's acknowledgement of the potential for a bad impact . " <p> Peggy Charren , a children 's television consultant and activist , lauded new federal requirements for three hours per week of educational programming for kids . <p> Mrs. Charren and others also welcomed the invention of the " V chip , " which will allow parents to screen violent programs beginning in 1998 . But they held that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " There are some excruciatingly horrific games out there , " Charren said . " It 's one thing to prevent your own child from owning them ... but then you must worry about the friend down the street who owns one that your child can play . " <p> Many of the specialists said there is considerable consensus on how to better help young people . The issue , they said , is implementation . And they sounded a theme of broad-based responsibility for progress - through such means as involved parents , high expectations by teachers , and committed schools . <p> " The role of the community is clear . We have to empower the grandmothers , the priests , the people in the community who can make a difference , " said Martin Gerry , director of the Center for the Study of Family , Neighborhood and Community Policy at the University of Kansas . " We do n't need more services , we need more caring . "
