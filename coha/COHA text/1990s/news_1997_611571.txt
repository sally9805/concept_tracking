<p> Madeleine Kunin was a child of 7 when her Jewish family , fearing a possible Nazi invasion , fled her native Switzerland . She returned there last year as the ambassador of her adopted country , the United States . Now , in a dramatic underscoring of how the echoes of a tragic time still reverberate , Kunin apparently has found her mother 's name on the list of 1,756 dormant World War II-era accounts published Wednesday by Swiss banks . <p> The U.S. Embassy in Bern said today that Kunin , a former governor of Vermont and a former deputy secretary of education , had discovered the name Renee May , the same as her mother 's , among the account holders . May , who brought her young daughter and son to New York during the early days of the war , died in Burlington , Vt. , in 1969 . Kunin will go through the filing process set up by the banks in search of more information , an embassy spokeswoman said . <p> For Kunin  --  and for others who were less fortunate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the list in 28 countries may shed a bit of light on previously obscured corners of their personal histories . For some , it may also allow access to assets  --  in most cases of apparently modest value  --  that belonged to long-dead relatives and have been hidden for more than a half-century behind the previously impregnable wall of secrecy imposed by Swiss banking laws . <p> But while publication of the list may fill in the blanks for a few , for many others  --  both Jews and non-Jews  --  it leaves unresolved their search for answers about the interaction of Swiss banks with their families . These banks , which once had the reputation of being the surest guarantor of the safety of their clients ' accounts , now stand accused of using the secrecy laws to keep the assets of Holocaust victims beyond the reach of their rightful heirs . <p> Although publication of the list marks the first step in an attempt to make amends , critics say there is a big question about whether the banks can restore their reputation for probity . <p> The heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as elected officials such as Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato ( R-N.Y. ) , have charged that the banks sought for years to minimize the number of accounts that might be involved and the total amount of money in them . For a long time , the banks said there probably was no more than $ 2 million , but the total in those accounts made public Wednesday was estimated at $ 42 million . <p> " It was part of a pattern of obfuscation , a pattern of withholding . . . that is 50 years overdue , " D'Amato said . Thomas Lyssy , vice president of the Swiss Jewish Federation , asserted that " the credibility of the banks is shattered . " <p> While the banks ' actions are of considerable interest to international bankers and lawyers , most of the world 's attention in the past three days has been focused on the individual stories told , or left untold , by the list . <p> As expected , there were Jews trying to save some funds and valuables from Nazi persecution . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Europe during the war years , ranging from German farmers living along the Swiss border to deposed Russian and French aristocrats from an earlier era . <p> And there apparently even were a scattering of Nazi officials or collaborators putting away nest eggs in neutral Switzerland that well might have included loot from Jewish victims . <p> Some who scanned the list tentatively found what they were looking for . In Israel , where there are more than 300,000 Holocaust survivors , Gretta Landsburg , a 52-year-old schoolteacher whose parents escaped from Germany to Israel in 1937 , spotted what she believes was her mother 's maiden name . <p> " Both my mother and my father are dead now , " she said . " But I never knew my mother 's or my father 's family . They were murdered before I was born . Will the money make up for the suffering ? Will it make up for having no family  --  no aunts , no uncles , no grandparents ? " <p> Some who have searched for years for some sign of family assets were destined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peter Bloch , 75 , recalls vividly how in 1936 or 1937 his mother made a perilous trip to Basel , Switzerland , to entrust the family 's savings to a distant relative there . <p> " I still remember that she brought back Swiss chocolate , " he said . " But later in 1942 when I got to Switzerland , I wrote to the relative and he answered that he had no money belonging to my family . . . . I looked at the list to see if his or my family name was there . But I did n't have much hope . He probably just took the money from my mother and put it in his pocket without ever opening an account . " <p> Also disappointed was Kenneth Ward , 74 , a retired manager for a foot-care company who went to Britain from Frankfurt on Aug. 25 , 1939 , one week before the war began . Ward , who was 10 at the time , was on what he believes was the last transport out of Germany to Britain . His blind father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His father died from cold and starvation in the Lodz ghetto , his mother was gassed , and the brother was never heard of again . <p> Ward joined the British army and changed his name from Wurzberger to Ward to foil German attempts to identify him in case of capture . He became part of a tank crew that landed in the D-Day invasion of Normandy " and fought all the way up to the other side of Hamburg . " He remembers that his parents put some money in Swiss accounts because they feared the Nazis would take over German accounts . But he does n't know how much , he said . That sort of thing was kept confidential since it was illegal to take money out of Germany , he explained . <p> In Germany itself , members of the small Jewish community have cited this climate of fear and secrecy in the 1930s as the reason why there was little expectation of finding a relative 's name on an account . Peter Ambos , a spokesman for the community , said : " You have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and know nothing about bank accounts in Switzerland . If they learn about it now , it 's purely by coincidence . " <p> One group of accounts that almost certainly will never be the object of claims belonged to a handful of people that some Jewish groups tentatively identified as prominent Nazis . Although none have been identified with certainty , some accounts may have been those of Heinrich Hoffmann , Hitler 's personal photographer ; Willi Bauer , an alias of Anton Burger , who was an aide to Adolf Eichmann ; Hermann Eser , a Nazi-era vice president of the Bundestag ; Herman Schmitz , an industrialist whose firm had slave labor factories in concentration camps ; Karl Jager , accused of the mass killing of Jews in Lithuania ; and Elise Eder , which might be an incorrect identification of Elizabeth Eder , wife of SS general Ernst Kaltenbrunner . Another account might have belonged to Vojtech Tuka , who served as prime minister of the Nazi puppet state installed in Slovakia after the German occupation of Czechoslovakia . <p> " Imagine the feelings of victims ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Holocaust Education Trust , as they " see the names of victims alongside those of their murderers . " <p> The accounts included in this week 's published list are only those that were opened by non-Swiss in the period before or during the war and that have been dormant since 1945 . A much larger list of more than 20,000 accounts that were opened by Swiss citizens , who might have been acting as proxies for people wanting to conceal their identities , is to be published in October . For that reason , several lawyers involved in a $ 20 billion class-action lawsuit on behalf of more than 18,000 people against the Swiss banks said today that this week 's revelations were " only the tip of the iceberg . " <p> Michael Hausfeld , a Washington attorney who is co-chair of the litigation team in the lawsuit , said : " This just touches a very small portion of just the accounts that were voluntarily opened by refugees from 1933 to 1945 which remain unaccounted for . That itself is a small portion of the total claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the suit accused the Swiss banks of releasing the names at this time to distract public attention from a hearing scheduled for next Thursday in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn at which the banks will ask for dismissal of the class-action suit . These lawyers also said that the system being set up to handle claims against the accounts might involve processing fees that would discourage some potential claimants . <p> That was denied by lawyers representing the banks . These lawyers , who asked not to be identified , said the banks are assuming all costs except for those of attorneys that claimants might hire to represent them . The banks ' lawyers also said plans for disclosing the account names were underway before the district court set next week 's hearing date . <p> " The banks are doing what they should do , " one of their lawyers said . " They have set up a transparent process for people to come forward and claim money that may be due them in an efficient , easy way .
