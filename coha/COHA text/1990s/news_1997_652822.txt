<p> " WE GIVE A GREAT concert , " Christoph von Dohnanyi remarked with more bemusement than bitterness during tours of the Cleveland Orchestra a decade ago , " and George Szell gets a great review . " <p> You could almost bank on it . In virtually every review outside Cleveland , Szell 's name appeared well ahead of Mr. Dohnanyi 's . No matter that Lorin Maazel sustained and may have enhanced the orchestra 's technical level , if not its spirit , as music director from 1972 to 1982 . No matter that Mr. Dohnanyi , a German , quickly won the respect of most players and boosted the group 's morale on taking over in 1984 . Szell , who ruled the orchestra with an iron hand from 1946 to his death in 1970 , lingered as figurehead in the public imagination just as he did  --  and does  --  in the frayed psyches of a few older players . <p> Things are different as Mr. Dohnanyi takes the orchestra to Carnegie Hall on Thursday evening for the first of three concerts variously celebrating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been cited as perhaps America 's finest orchestra , more or less on a par with the august philharmonics of Vienna and Berlin . And Mr. Dohnanyi has increasingly been credited with the achievement , which , despite numerous and crucial changes of personnel in recent years , seems only to have grown more impressive . <p> " It 's time to let the poor man rest , " David Zauder said of Szell . Mr. Zauder , who has been a trumpeter in the orchestra for 39 years and was its personnel manager until recently , remains one of its great spirits , pending his retirement in the spring . He describes his time in the orchestra , including Mr. Maazel 's tenure and an interim period with Pierre Boulez in the early 70 's , as a golden age . <p> " The comparisons were always odious , " Mr. Zauder said . " These people worked at different times under different conditions with different concepts and different ideas . Dohnanyi is his own man , and he himself has changed . He has become more relaxed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his ideas . " <p> As well he might be , for the 67-year-old Mr. Dohnanyi 's independent standing has also grown of late . Long respected internationally for his work in opera 's more cerebral precincts and in contemporary music , he has received more general acclaim as guest conductor of the Philharmonia Orchestra both at home in London and in Paris residencies . In the fall , he becomes the Philharmonia 's principal conductor , and some London critics have begun to anticipate a return to its golden age , though Mr. Dohnanyi will undoubtedly have to share good tour reviews with Otto Klemperer . <p> " It 's absolutely clear that Cleveland is my musical home , " Mr. Dohnanyi insisted recently in his dressing room at Severance Hall after a concert . The program , the one to be presented at Carnegie on Friday , Schubert 's 200th birthday , consisted of the composer 's 9th Symphony and Luciano Berio 's " Rendering , " based on sketches for Schubert 's 10th . <p> " This orchestra is my priority as long as I 'm here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 2000 . Beyond that , he said , " we 'll have to talk . " He spends some 15 weeks a year in Cleveland , he explained , and considers such a commitment necessary for a music director . ( The Philharmonia position will demand less . ) <p> But he does not necessarily relish doing 15 different programs a year , with all the attendant preparation . Why , he reasonably wonders , ca n't a major unfamiliar work  --  Schumann 's " Scenes From Goethe 's ' Faust , ' " say , or Bartok 's " Bluebeard 's Castle "  --  be repeated from one season to the next rather than sink back into oblivion ? <p> " The older you get , the more you realize how little you can achieve vertically in a piece in so little time , " he said . " I would like to do important pieces more . " <p> " Vertical " is one of Mr. Dohnanyi 's favorite words these days , conveying a wish to delve more deeply into things . The sentiment is as characteristic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughtful man in ways that he does not readily reveal for publication . However questions are framed , the answers tend to resemble those already seen in print , and he is more guarded than ever since an English journalist printed some of his loose talk about conductorial colleagues a few years ago . <p> At times , Mr. Dohnanyi , whose command of English is excellent , can seem downright glib , as when , almost a decade ago , he spoke about his youth in Berlin . " I had a great childhood , " he said . " There was reading , there was playing , there was hating school . Everything was normal . " <p> To an outsider , the reality looks harsher . Mr. Dohnanyi 's father , Hans von Dohnanyi , was hanged by the Nazi regime shortly before the end of World War II after months of torture for his central role in a series of abortive plots to assassinate Hitler , starting in 1938 . Three of the conductor 's uncles , including the noted theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer , who was also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a view of life a 14-year-old must get when he has to write to his father and godfather in prison for months on end , " Bonhoeffer wrote of him in 1943 . " He can not have many illusions about the world now ; I suppose all these happenings mean the end of his childhood . " <p> Christoph von Dohnanyi was born in Berlin in 1929 . One grandfather was the famous Hungarian pianist and composer Erno Dohnanyi , whom he met only once , in 1938 , before studying with him in Jacksonville , Fla. , in 1952 . His other grandfather was Karl Bonhoeffer , a noted pyschiatrist who crossed swords with Freud and Jung . <p> Mr. Dohnanyi 's father , a jurist , used his positions in the ministry of justice and the military intelligence to help Jews escape deportation and execution . With some justice , the Gestapo called him " the instigator and guiding spirit of the movement to destroy the Fuhrer . " The conductor 's mother , Christine Bonhoeffer , was also deeply involved in subversive activities and was imprisoned for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who went on to became mayor of Hamburg , Christoph von Dohnanyi studied law for a time . Despite his switch to music , he retains a broad view of professional and personal responsibility , as evidenced by his censure of Erno Dohnanyi , whose musicianship he greatly praises , for a willingness to remain " just a musician . " <p> MR . DOHNANYI TOOK an interest in the case of the conductor Wilhelm Furtwangler long before Ronald Harwood 's play " Taking Sides " gave it wide circulation , focusing on Allied suspicions that Furtwangler harbored Nazi sympathies . " It is very hard to judge people of other times if you ca n't be in their position , " he said . " There is a very simple point : If you are able to help people , you must help , and Furtwangler did . Did he help more people by staying in Germany than he might have by leaving ? Who can say ? " <p> A similar disdain for easy answers colors Mr. Dohnanyi 's view of German reunification , which he has observed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1977 to 1984 , and he retains a home in Hamburg despite his recent separation from his second wife , the renowned German soprano Anja Silja , with whom he had three children , now grown . ( He also has a house here , a newly acquired apartment in Paris and a getaway in northern Wisconsin . ) <p> " To say that reunification should have been done this way or that way is a little like telling a woman she should have her child after 10 months or 11 months , " he said , gleefully mixing his stock metaphors . " Generally speaking , it 's going to happen after 9 months , and this just happened . Somehow , you have to jump on this raft without a paddle , and see what you can do with your own hands . It will take 20 or 30 years and a new generation before people in the East and West think the same and react the same . " <p> In short , Mr. Dohnanyi seems remarkably comfortable with ambiguity , and a kind of fatalistic acceptance informs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carnegie concerts . Perhaps the most interesting program , on Thursday , presents the completed torsos of intended larger works : Schubert 's " Unfinished " Symphony , in two movements ; the Andante from his 10th Symphony , and the Adagio from Mahler 's 10th . Such items hold a particular fascination for him . <p> " Michelangelo did two ' Pietas , ' and to my mind the unfinished one is more exciting , " he said . " It leaves more to the imagination . It was as if he came to realize that this must remain unfinished to be great . <p> " I believe very strongly that there are no accidents in art . If this is the way it is , this is the way it 's supposed to be . ' Unfinished ' is the wrong word in art . It 's like saying that Schubert lived an unfinished life . It 's simply a life , and the ' Unfinished ' is simply a symphony . " <p> As for Schubert 's Ninth Symphony , which is finished and then some ( at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , Mr. Zauder , the trumpeter , cites it as a prime example of the way Mr. Dohnanyi has changed . " Five or six years ago , he was overly concerned with precision , " Mr. Zauder said . " But his interpretation has become less academic , less constricted , freer and more expansive even though the tempos are now a touch faster . It is a breathing thing with a life of its own . " <p> This freedom , in Mr. Zauder 's view , represents not only an improvement in Mr. Dohnanyi 's work but also an advantage over Szell 's . Tastes and memories differ , of course , and another veteran player points to the Andante of the Ninth as an instance in which Mr. Dohnanyi falls short of Szell in subtlety of interpretation . " He 's a very straightforward guy , " the musician said of Mr. Dohnanyi , though without selling more admired qualities short . <p> Amid other minor , generally isolated complaints from the troops , a larger one arises from several quarters . Many players dislike the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago , with second violins front right and cellos and basses left of center , next to the first violins . <p> " The effects of seating order have been underrated tremendously by everyone , including myself , " said Mr. Dohnanyi , who is otherwise no fan of the various aspects of performance practice that have arisen out of the early-music movement . " In Brahms 's Second Piano Concerto , for example , with the cello soloist right next to the pianist , it becomes chamber music . I do n't have to conduct . " <p> Mr. Dohnanyi , who fancies himself a bit of a psychologist carrying on his maternal grandfather 's legacy , says that he overcame early grumbling about the issue by telling the players , " You are so good that if anyone can do this , you can do it . " In fact , it appears that he overcame the grumbling by ignoring it , for it continues in force . <p> Still , by the standards of other major American orchestras , the Cleveland remains relatively free of dissension . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strike over a new contract last month was more a matter of miscommunication than anything else . By Mr. Dohnanyi 's report and others , William Preucil , the former first violinist of the Cleveland Quartet , has done a superb job of filling the huge shoes of Daniel Majeske , the longtime concertmaster , who died in 1993 . And John Mack remains a stalwart principal oboist and linchpin of tradition , hoping to make this tour before having to submit to overdue back surgery . <p> All in all , Mr. Dohnanyi considers himself lucky with what he calls " this Rolls-Royce of orchestras . " And he holds that judgment on good authority . He likes to recount his last discussion with the notoriously demanding maestro Herbert von Karajan , in 1987 . " You 're very fortunate , " Mr. Dohnanyi quoted Karajan . " This is the only orchestra in the world where I did n't know what to say anymore after the third rehearsal . " <p> Both professionally and privately , Mr. Dohnanyi seems eminently content despite a personal life that he calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed marriages . <p> " I do nothing I do n't want to do , " he said . " Fortunately , I no longer have to do anything just for the money . I 'm thankful for having achieved a tremendous amount of inner freedom . " <p> Where the Dohnanyis come from , that counts for a lot .
