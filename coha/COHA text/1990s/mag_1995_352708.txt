At the end of 1831 , the French artist Eugene Delacroix did something that would change the course of his own art , and to no small degree that of French painting itself . He left Paris and went to Morocco  --  an arduous journey in those days , on winter roads to Marseilles and then by naval frigate to Tangier . It was made easier by his connections . The 34-year-old painter was traveling with his friend , a French diplomat named Charles de Mornay , sent to conclude a treaty with Moulay Abd-er-Rahman , the Sultan of Morocco . ( France had conquered neighboring Algeria the year before and did not want any Moroccan interventions in its new colony . ) The mission , including Delacroix , arrived in Morocco in January 1832 and stayed six months . <P> Morocco would change Delacroix profoundly . For the next 30 years , the last half of his life , images from " the land of lions and leather , " as he called it in a letter from Meknes , would recur in his work , meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he made there , along with the dense and ( to a modern eye ) almost cinematic impressions he jotted down in his journal , were a permanent resource he could draw from . Delacroix had already made a brilliant name for himself with " Oriental " subjects , including his Byronic denunciation of Turkish barbarity in Greece , The Massacres at Chios ( 1824 ) , and that enormous Romantic panorama of sex , death and animal vitality , The Death of Sardanapalus ( 1827 ) . <P> But these were fictions . He had never been to Greece , let alone ancient Asia . Morocco was real , and it bowled Delacroix over . There , he wrote to a friend in Paris , he was confronted " at every step " with " ready-made paintings which would make the fame and fortune of 20 generations of painters . " And in a sense he was right . From Delacroix on , Oriental exoticism would bulk ever larger in the offerings of the Paris salon : slave markets , dim fretted courtyards , hawk-nosed Arabs and their Barbary mounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journey south to the Near East would become a model for avant-garde painters looking for purer and more intense experiences of light , locale and color than Northern Europe could offer . Van Gogh went south to Arles ; Paul Klee , Wassily Kandinsky and above all Henri Matisse would reach North Africa . " I have found landscapes in Morocco , " Matisse claimed , " exactly as they are described in Delacroix 's paintings . " Morocco satisfied something in the early modernist quest for explicit , fresh , formal experience . And it was Delacroix who pointed the artists there . <P> The results of his own journey are set forth in a compelling show of some 100 paintings and sketches on view through Jan. 15 at the Institut du Monde Arabe in Paris , " Delacroix : The Voyage to Morocco , " curated by Brahim Alaoui.
