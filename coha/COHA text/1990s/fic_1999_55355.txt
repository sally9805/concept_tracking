Kai opened her eyes and looked around her . She was disoriented until she saw the Canadian customs booth in front , with the maple leaf decal on one of the glass panes . She realized she had fallen asleep , missing both the customs booth on the U.S. side and the Ambassador Bridge . Now she and Bailey were at the Canadian border , the first car in the long line of cars , waiting to be questioned by the border guard before proceeding north . <p> " You had a nap , " Bailey said . <p> " Yes , " Kai replied , wondering if she should apologize for having fallen asleep in the midst of their conversation . She glanced at him . He was the palest man she had ever seen : his eyes behind thick glasses , his thinning hair and beard , his freckles . Even his voice that had lulled her to sleep was pale , colorless . He looked like an insect , weak and vulnerable , that had just emerged from its old shell . She guessed he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Now he stepped on the gas and brought the car alongside the booth . The guard , a young woman with long hair and plum-colored nails , asked Bailey what his purpose was in entering Canada . <p> " We 're going to see a Chinese herbal doctor , " Bailey answered . " Here in Windsor . " <p> " He 's seeing the doctor , not me , " Kai chimed in . " I do n't need one . " At once she felt foolish . The guard had n't even glanced at her , much less asked her a question . <p> " Kai Ding here is my interpreter , " Bailey said . " The Chinese doctor does n't speak a word of English , and I do n't speak a word of Chinese . " <p> The guard put her hand across her mouth to stifle a yawn before waving them on . <p> Bailey drove out of the plaza . " I 'm glad you 're feeling better than me , " he said grimly . <p> Kai was not exactly feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disliked seat belts , especially this one , which seemed like a giant staple nailing her frail chest to the seat . <p> " ... the street , " Bailey was saying . " But Dr. Tu and his wife have a two-story house on Wyandotte . Upstairs is the living quarters , and downstairs is the office and shop . " <p> " How many times have you seen this Dr. Tu ? " Kai asked . Kai worked in Student Financial Operations with Bailey 's cousin . They 'd offered to pay Kai for her interpreting work , but she 'd said no , it was n't necessary . Bailey had an inoperable tumor . <p> " I 've seen Dr. Tu twice , " he told her . " Once with my meditation group , the second time with a Chinese girl from Hong Kong . She has since returned to her country . " He rolled down the window . " I 've forgotten Dr. Tu 's house number . " <p> Kai was busy searching for her own landmarks . More than a decade ago she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come here often to eat and shop for Chinese food and groceries . Then just about this time , during the fall season , Ping ran off to New Mexico with his graduate assistant , and their group eventually broke up . Only recently did she realize what she missed most about Ping  --  not his love , but his presence , a presence to talk to , make connection with . <p> They were close to Ouillette Avenue when Bailey discovered he had come too far . He turned back and found the place . After parking the car across the street , Bailey led the way to Dr. Tu 's house . <p> The first-floor shop was long and narrow , shaped like a Band-Aid , Kai thought . To the right , along the length of the wall , were built-in shelves crammed with large containers made of glass , wood , tin , copper , bamboo , or cardboard . Kai could see the herbs inside the glass ones . In front of the shelves was a display case stuffed with boxes of pills and powders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ginseng . In the midst of all these things was a twelve-inch long , double-tiered rack lined with red satin , and resting on the shimmering material were several dark objects that Kai could not identify . <p> The aisles on both sides of the display case were narrow . There were enough fluorescent tubes on the ceiling to light up a room five times the size . Everything seemed to ache under the bright glare . <p> A middle-aged woman , standing behind the display case , was weighing a handful of dried dates on a tiny scale . <p> " This is Mrs. Tu , " Bailey whispered to Kai . <p> " Ni hao , Mrs. Tu . Mr. Bailey has an appointment to see Dr. Tu , " Kai said in Chinese . <p> At first the woman stared at them without recognition . Then her round face broke into a smile , revealing a mouthful of gold teeth . " Barley , Barley , " she cried loudly and hurried to the back of the room . <p> " That 's what they call me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soon she heard footsteps coming down the stairs , and a man appeared with one hand on his head , patting down the few strands of white hair . " Barley , Barley , " he said . <p> Bailey made the introductions . Dr. Tu , a short plump man , turned his body sideways as he walked down the aisle , squeezing past them , and opened a small door to an office next to the front entrance . The office resembled a closet , crammed with a folding bed and a desk , with a chair on each side . The lighting was no less glaring . <p> The men took the two chairs . Kai stood in the doorway . Dr. Tu opened the drawer and pulled out a sheet of paper . Kai saw it was Bailey 's list of herbs written in Chinese . <p> " Shang ci de batie bangmang ma ? " the old man asked . <p> Kai turned to Bailey . " Dr. Tu wants to know about the eight dosages of herbs he gave you the last time , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Not noticeably . " <p> Kai translated . <p> " Ah , tell Barley he must be patient . Chinese herbs work very slowly . " <p> This man is a quack , Kai wanted to say to Bailey . He 's dispensing snake oil by the barrel . Chinese doctors are only good for curing common colds , mild fever , indigestion , diarrhea , and maybe hemorrhoids . Not for anything as serious as a tumor ! <p> As if sensing Kai 's agitation , Dr. Tu motioned to her to sit on the bed . Kai told Bailey what Dr. Tu had said , trying to sound as civil as possible , then took her seat . Bailey nodded amiably . <p> Dr. Tu asked Bailey to put his right arm on the desk , the palm turned upward . Then he began to hao-mai , take the pulse . He placed three fingers on the wrist , and these fingers began to move around the area like tiny mice sniffing for cheese . <p> Kai knew that Chinese doctors used hao-mai in all diagnoses . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pulse vibrating through a silk string . This had happened in the last emperor 's court , where no male doctors were allowed into the women 's bedchambers . Every time a royal consort became ill , she stayed in her room and tied one end of a silk string around her wrist . The servant took the other end and , extending it into the next room , gave it to the doctor to hao-mai . Kai always had her doubts about this story . <p> Finished with the pulse , the old man picked up the prescription sheet and said , " Please tell Barley I am adding two more herbs to this list . His physical condition has improved , so I am making the medicine stronger . " <p> " And will the medicine shrink the tumor , Dr. Tu ? " Kai asked , without trying to mask the sarcasm in her voice . <p> Dr. Tu started and looked at her . " Of course . I adjust the prescription every time I see him . To make sure everything works . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the catch . <p> " Please ask Barley how many portions , or dosages , he wants this time . He knows how to boil each dosage , reduce it to three cups , and drink it every other day . " Dr. Tu held up eight fingers for Bailey . " Eight dosages ? Yes ? " <p> " Good , that 's two months ' supply . " Bailey clasped his hands in a gesture of thanks . <p> With the session over , Kai glanced at her watch . " Is this it , Bailey ? Can we leave soon ? " <p> " Oh no . " Bailey reached into his jeans for the car keys . " Dr. Tu has to prepare the herbs , and that 'll take him about an hour . I always go shopping for a special kind of cheese I ca n't find in Michigan . It was sold out the last time I was here . Want to come along ? " <p> Kai hesitated . What little interpreting she 'd done had exhausted her . She realized she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She waved goodbye to him and said to Dr. Tu , " Wo zai zhe li deng . " <p> " Of course , make yourself at home , " the old man said . <p> After Bailey left , Mrs. Tu dragged out a chair from the back room and placed it in the middle of the aisle , right in front of the satin-lined rack . " We have many herbs to weigh and then divide into eight portions for Barley . It will take time , " she said . <p> Kai had not been in an herbal store since she left China more than twenty years earlier . But she remembered the smells : dry and acrid , at times a bit too pungent , other times as delightful as any perfume . She sat down and leaned forward to examine the rack . The Chinese labels indicated that the two small objects were deer horns , the larger one was part of a rhinoceros horn . She had heard that these were some kind of elixir , ground into powder or soaked in wine and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like young bucks . There were no price tags . <p> Dr. Tu was behind the counter . He looked at the containers before pulling one off the shelf , unscrewed the lid , and lifted out one fistful of herbs . As he pushed them onto the tiny scale , the leaves and the stems broke . The remains fell on the counter and on the floor . Unconcerned , he continued to weigh the herbs , adding and subtracting the amount , before dumping them into a brown bag . The process was repeated ten times before he finished with the first item on the prescription . <p> Kai glanced at her watch . As Dr. Tu brought out more and more herbs to weigh , the area around the scale and the counter became layered with fragments , the air thick with dust . Kai 's nose began to tickle uncontrollably . <p> Mrs. Tu got out eight tinfoil baking pans , badly dented and out of shape , and spread them on the counter . Then she picked up the first brown bag and began to divide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered why the old man had not weighed the herbs eight times in the first place , thus saving his wife the extra work . He was so slow , so sloppy . He and his wife should have changed places . <p> Frustration rose like the herbal dust inside Kai . Bailey should have warned her of this long wait . Then she would have brought reading material , crossword puzzles , anything . She got off her chair and took a few steps to the other end of the room . <p> Here the countertop was stacked with books on subjects that ranged from palmistry , geomancy , feng-sui , kung-fu , and astrology to classical Chinese novels and operas . Next to the books were half a dozen Chinese teacups , cracked and chipped around the edges . She thought they were to be thrown out until she saw the dregs in the bottom . Evidently they had been used earlier in the day . She turned and walked back to her seat . <p> To her surprise she heard herself say , without meaning to say it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take my pulse ? " <p> The old man continued to weigh the herbs . <p> " Will you please hao-mai for me ? " she repeated louder . <p> Dr. Tu looked up . " Ah , I did not think I heard you correctly . Yes , of course I will . " He brushed his clothing , wiped his hands on a towel , and stepped out from behind the counter . <p> They went into the office and sat down at the desk . Kai placed her arm on the desktop and felt the old man 's fingers on her wrist exerting a light pressure . <p> The old man closed his eyes . At last he said , " Your body system is not well-balanced . Too much obstruction in the vital channels , thus preventing the flow of energy . We call this condition xu . " He picked up a pen and wrote the word on the paper . <p> What else is new , Kai thought . <p> " You need adjustments in your system , " he continued . <p> Kai pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dr. Tu was quite a good calligrapher if nothing else . She looked at the desk and noticed the plate glass that covered the desktop . Finally she looked at the old man . On his right cheek were several liver spots . She remembered they were called shou-ban , longevity marks . How the Chinese love euphemisms ! But there was no euphemism for her . <p> " I had a mastectomy five years ago , Dr. Tu . They took both breasts . " <p> " Oh , my dear lady , " Dr. Tu murmured . <p> " Last year I had a second operation due to ... a spillage of cancer cells from ... first operation . " Without any warning , Kai burst out crying . She covered her face as the tears poured out , between the fingers and down her arms . Her sobs seemed to come from a great distance , inhuman and terrifying . Her temples throbbed as if someone was stomping on her head . <p> Her aunt had once cried like this  --  on the night of Kai 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family that her husband had brought a concubine into the house . Kai had wept along with her aunt , not because she knew what " concubine " meant , but because she was carried away by her aunt 's ferocious grief . <p> Kai realized Dr. Tu was tapping his finger on the desk . " I do not understand the word , ssss ... " <p> " Spillage . That 's English . I ca n't translate it . " <p> " Ssss ... " <p> " During the second operation ... I had no breasts left then ... they continued to scrape and scrape ... the wall of my chest ... " She could not stop weeping even though she felt it might be a burden to this old man . It was just as well that he did n't understand the word ; just as well that they could n't make connection with each other . <p> " Use this , " he said and thrust something between her hands . Through the blur , she saw it was a man 's linen handkerchief , clean and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handkerchief . <p> " Please , " Dr. Tu urged . " Tell me how to spell it . I have a dictionary here . " He reached under the desk and , with both hands , lifted up a big book with The English-Chinese Dictionary printed on the spine . " I am turning to the pages of S. What letter is after S ? " <p> " P , then i , then l ... " <p> " Wait , please . Is b after s ? " <p> " No , p as in Paul . " <p> " Excuse , please . What means Bau ? " <p> Her crying stopped as suddenly as it had started . Looking into his face she realized she had confused him . She wiped her eyes with the handkerchief and reached for the book . " Here , let me find it . " <p> " I see . It means poh , " the old man said when she finally located the word . <p> " Yes , spillage is poh , " she said . " Like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the container and weigh them . " <p> The old man paused and narrowed his eyes . " I see . You think I waste the herbs ? No , no . I pick up the big pieces and put them back in the container . " <p> " What about the small pieces and all the particles ? " " I save them also . Behind the counter , on the floor , is a plastic rug to catch the particles . I gather them and brew them into teas for friends . " <p> " Teas for friends ! " she repeated . <p> " For close friends only . Who do not think such a gesture ... insulting . " He patted the dictionary . " This word poh , you must not be afraid of it . Sometimes it is not all bad meaning . " <p> " It 's a terrible word to me . I dream of doctors scraping and scraping my chest until they scrape out my heart . Then I become ... " She began to weep again . " ... a shell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sighed loudly . He lifted a finger and touched a tear on her face . " This is poh , also . " <p> Kai watched him close his dictionary and push it under the desk . Then he opened the drawer , took out a tiny piece of flannel , and began to wipe the glass with great gentleness . <p> " I will give you some herbs to help you sleep better , " he said . " They are all tiny pieces , leftovers , so there will be no charge . " He smiled for the first time and stood up . <p> " Do you mind if I sit here for a while ? " <p> " I will turn off the light and leave the door open . Then you will hear Barley coming back . " <p> " Oh , yes , Bailey . " She hoped he had found his special cheese . If he was too tired to drive home , she would offer to do it for him . <p> She leaned back in her chair and saw , even in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tu had wiped it so clean . She thought of the dirty teacups in the other room . Maybe she could find some new ones in a store along Wyandotte , not to replace the old ones but to add to them . She reached for her purse and stood up . <p> " Cha-bei gei cha-you , teacups for tea friends , " she said to Dr. and Mrs. Tu . The words sounded nice , as nice in Chinese as in English . <p> <p> By Mabelle Hsueh <p>
