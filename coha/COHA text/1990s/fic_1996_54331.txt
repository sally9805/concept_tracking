Fiction writers often have a wide variety of jobs before they make a living off their fiction sales . Sometimes the writers already have writing careers  --  nonfiction writing careers . Amy Sterling Casil is one such writer . Her nonfiction has appeared in women 's and literary publications . Lately she has concentrated on her short fiction . She went to the Clarion Writers ' Workshop , and she was a finalist in the Writers of the Future contest in 1995 . <p> To make ends meet , she works as the Executive Director of Family Service Association &; Home Again Project . She lives in Redlands , California with her husband and daughter . <p> Outside my office , I hear the rubbery squeal of a wheelchair , followed by the damp exhalation of a sick child 's sigh . The shadow of the pump-kin-headed boy , Jonny , crosses the wall like a dark hand slapped on a sheet . <p> " Come in , " I call through the open door . <p> " Sure , Dr. Arian , " Jonny says , lisping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but I 'm used to the way hc talks . <p> Jonny wheels into my office . He 's very limber with the chair . In his hand is a small , crooked paper Santa and something else that I ca n't quite fathom , made of festive paper . I finish the letter I 'm composing and smile . It 's not easy to smile at Jonny . <p> He holds the paper Santa up . " I made this for Gramma , " he says . <p> " That 's a great St. Nick , " I say . My mouth twists in a funny way , and I do n't like the feeling . His grandmother has n't visited him for at least three years , yet Jonny makes her something for every holiday . Her presents are all in a shoebox , tucked neatly in his cubby in Dorm A. , where the seriously ill children live . <p> " This is for you , " he says , holding out the other bit of artwork . I see now that it 's pieces of paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The little present has " I love you , Dr. Arlan " written on it in spidery letters . " That 's a great job , Jonny . " <p> In a fit of the unprofessionalism which seems to have become my habit of late , I push away from the desk and walk to Jonny 's side , then kiss his patchy scalp . Jonny giggles and kisses me back . If I look in his good left eye , which is large , brown , and very pretty , I can pretend for a moment he 's a normal child . He tums toward me as he laughs , and it 's impossible to pretend any longer . <p> Jonny 's third eye stares vacantly . He can see only from his left eye , not the one on the right or the one in the center of his large , flat forehead . I gently stroke his veined head , which is twice as large as the head of a child his age should be , and I whisper that his grandmother will be very pleased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from which Jonny suffers Webern syndrome . it 's not a common birth defect , but it 's one of the more unpleasant conditions children have come to suffer from in this , our pestilent age . <p> I 'm Hedrick Arian , forty-six years old , a doctor of education , not medicine . I 've been the administrator of Southern California Sherman Institute for Differently Abled Children for six years . Jonny is nearly seven . He and I arrived at this place on the same day . He is a part of the landscape , like our chairs , molded in solid hunks of indestructible plastic , the mottled gray composite floors , the nurses , the aides , the everpresent medication and the constant stream of visitors who want to gawk at the children . <p> " Gramma is coming , " he says , spraying my face with his spittle . " This year , I know she 'll come . " <p> " Of course she will , " I say . The lies fall so easily from my lips these days . I pat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my office , waving goodbye with one tiny six-fingered hand . <p> Jonny 's family signed him over to the state and has forgotten he was ever born . Part of me understands their distress at bearing such a child into the world . Another part of me knows the history . and I ca n't help but feel a nasty stab of fury in my gut , because Jonny 's mother drank daily during her pregnancy , and took every drug she could find in staggering quantities . <p> Was it the drugs that made Jonny what he is ? I do n't know . They say the virus which altered Jonny 's genes is both sly and opportunistic . The thing at work inside of him found a dirty needle somewhere or came through a perforated condom , that much we do know . <p> When I first came , my friends would ask , " How can you stand all those little children , suffering ? " They said this in a disbelieving tone that really meant , " I ca n't believe you 're taking care of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often . <p> Years ago , Sherman housed developmentally disabled children , the ones they called " morons " and " imbeciles . " But no longer . This disease Jonny has , the DNA thief , started a decade ago . The initial wave of the stricken did n't fall ill , so most of them did n't realize that anything was happening , while the tiny bit of protein that saw them as a universe of meat lodged in their gametes , multiplied itself , changed things . Then , they bore children . Children with something worse than missing limbs , or hydrocephaly or spina bifida or muscular dystrophy or cerebral palsy . <p> These children were born with bizarre defects , like Jonny 's ; a head sized and shaped like a great jack-o-lantern covered with patchy hair , extra fingers , extra toes , a spinal deformity that rendered him paraplegic and the ultimate horror , a blind , filmy , goggling third eye . <p> Then there were the children with no eyes , merely a nose hole and a gaping maw for a mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with fishy scales and slit-eyes , the ones with fins in place of hands and feet . <p> And the horrible irony was that most of Sherman 's charges were of normal intelligence . No gravely mentally disabled among them , these children were born with the ability , though they might not have even had eyes with which to see , of knowing how different they were , and one day perhaps realizing that despite all their pretty names , like " differently abled , " they were what most people called monsters . <p> I know the histories of our children , save the few found in dumpsters or on some church doorstep . Most are inner city kids , many of them brown or black or golden under their fur or scales . Jonny is black . <p> On certain nights , when I wake in a sweat at three in the morning and trudge to the patio for a cigarette , because my wife Monique will not allow me to smoke in the house , I wonder if God forgot all these children , while they grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these deformities , why not merely with old-fashioned spina bifida or muscular dystrophy or retardation or fetal alcohol syndrome ? <p> This virus , it 's like Blake 's scaly angel of death , coming for the first-born sons of the Egyptians , their parents waking to find their beloved children dead . Blake 's angel , drawing his foul gossamer wings over the lintels of all the parents of all the children of Sherman . <p> It 's the poison in our lives leaking out , I think , as I drive home to Monique and my lovely girl Karen , who is fifteen and blossoming and perfect in every way ; fierce poison leaching from the evil that is our modem lives , destroying and twisting genes , changing babies into monsters . It 's the vile despair of the inner city , the hopelessness , the cruelty , the poverty , writing itself large and making itself manifest , opening itself to the cruel , blind dance of proteins , amino acids . <p> I 've left Sherman , and I 'm pulling into the pizza place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pizza . Monique is on a diet again , and if I do n't bring something home , Karen and I will be stuck with pot pies , and I ca n't bear the thought of that . <p> I 'm still thinking about Jonny and his absent grandmother as I park . I do n't notice the guy in the lurid pink minitrack backing out . He squeals to a stop a few inches from my bumper , gives me the finger and yells something ugly . I ignore him . It 's not safe these days , getting into something , even in this bright minimall in my well-to-do neighborhood . The stink of his screeching tires stings my nostrils as I get out of the car . It smells like gunpowder . It smells like death . <p> Karen gobbles a piece of pizza , then kisses me on my cheek , before rushing out the door with one of her friends , Gina or Gia , I ca n't remember which . <p> " Cheerleader practice , Dad , " she says , by way of explanation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has settled in with her nail polish and a romance novel . I watch the news until it sickens me , then try to read some mystery novel that Monique had purchased and tired of . <p> I 'd hoped I could talk with Karen about Jonny . Karen had always shown an interest in the children , even when she herself was a young child . She 's such a bright girl , so sensitive . But , I thought , she 's growing up . She 's out more often than in . My friends tell me all teenagers are like this . <p> Monique 's face is porcelain smooth as she reads her book . It 's as if nothing has touched her over the years . I 've put on more pounds than I care to count . My face is lined , my mustache peppered depressingly with gray , and I wear what we used to charitably call " old man pants , " yet Monique looks barely different than the day we married . There 's no point in talking to her about Jonny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monique has closed the book and is filing her nails . " Karen 's at cheerleader practice , " I say . <p> She nods and murmurs something . I ca n't quite hear her . <p> " Tomorrow the Governor 's wife is visiting with some people , " I say . I had n't meant to tell Monique about this , but something is pressing me to talk to her this evening . <p> Monique puts the nail file down and looks up . " Really ? " Her cold blue eyes brighten . <p> " They 're coming at eleven . We 've got a musical program planned . " <p> " Oh , I 'd love to come ! Can I just show up ? " <p> " Sure . " I wonder why I have n't said something earlier . Everyone has invited their relatives , at least those who are interested in the Governor 's wife . Monique should be there . It would look strange if she was n't . <p> " That 's so exciting . Why did n't you tell me earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I found that expression fascinating . <p> " It 's been so hectic . I forgot , I guess . " <p> Monique shakes her head . She picks up her book . <p> " Jonny made another ornament for his grandmother today . He 's expecting her for Christmas , " I say , then I open my book . <p> Monique pushes her hair back and smiles . " Hed , what should I wear ? Do you think the cream suit , or the red jacket , for Christmas ? . What do you think the Governor 's wife will wear ? " <p> I pretend to read . I think I tell Monique to wear the cream suit , and a holiday pin . It does n't matter . She 'll look fine . She always looks fine . Everyone tells me what a beautiful wife I have . I 'm glad she wants to see the Governor 's wife . Monique is very lovely . She sits in her high-backed , beautiful chair and the light falls across her face , highlighting its delicate planes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I ca n't imagine ever touching her again . <p> I 'm color-blind . That 's why I had so much troble recognizing Jonny 's holiday gift . One of the only colors I can truly see is yellow . Perhaps that 's why I love Sherman 's auditorium . We painted it in shades of yellow and orange , to minor the Southern California sun . <p> Monique walks beside me in her cream suit as I lead the Governor 's wife and her entourage on a tour of Sherman . <p> After the first dorm , the Governor 's wife 's smile looks forced , as if she 'd set her face that way and now could n't change . She 's not a youngwoman . The lines in her forehead deepen with each child we visit . <p> A tiny vein in her neck starts throbbing when we visit Dorm B. We see the twins , Ky ! e and Kieran , getting their daily moisturizing bath . It 's important for the boys ' skin to be kept moist . Their scales flake away and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , what has happened to theme ? " the Governor 's wife whispers . <p> " They call it congenital ichthyosis , " I tell her . " The skin thickens into scales . The boys also have rudimentary gills . " <p> I pat the attendant 's arm . She 's a great , dark-skinned woman with a brilliant smile . The twins giggle and squirm . " This is their favorite part of the day , " she says , in a voice that echoes her native Venezuela . <p> The Governor 's wife asks the attendant a few questions about the twins . I see pain and horror in her eyes , as the boys smile and coo . " You 're pretty , " one of the boys says . He 's talking to Monique . I turn , and my wife looks as though she 's eaten a dried-out lime . <p> I mutter about how the boys are very affectionate . <p> " How can you stand it ? " Monique whispers through gritted teeth . <p> I just smile . We say goodbye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the program . I do n't want to be late . <p> We enter the sunny auditorium . The children have colored butcher-paper banners . Their theme is " What I Want to Be When I Grow Up , Santa . " The banners show nurses , doctors and railroad engineers . There are no cartoon characters among them . Sherman 's children are blissfully ignorant of violent superheroes and insipid cartoons . The pictures remind me of what we used to draw as children , when we believed that nurses and police officers and fire-fighters were heroes . <p> The Governor 's wife smiles again , a more genuine smile . Jonny 's class comes to the stage . He is in the front . They sing " Jingle Bells " and " Hark the Herald Angels Sing . " When they get to the chorus of " Hark the Herald Angels , " Jonny sings " Glory to the newborn King , " in a high , sweet , slightly bubbly voice . The Governor 's wife claps . Tears glisten in her eyes . <p> I reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips and draws away . <p> " Oh , his eyes ! What would cause that ? " the Governor 's wife exclaims . <p> I tell her the name of his syndrome . She shakes her head . Jonny approaches the microphone . " All I want for Christmas is to give my gramma a kiss , " he says . The Governor 's wife makes a little choking noise , and puts her hand to her mouth . Monique sits still , beside me . The muscles in her thighs are tight as steel cords . <p> " Will his family be here for Christmas ? " the Governor 's wife asks . I shrug . Jonny and his class wheel away , amid the applause of the staff and the teachers and the Governor 's wife . Monique claps her delicate hands like a doll someone has wound up and set to performing . <p> The younger children come on stage . They have prepared a mini-Nutcracker for the Governor 's wife . <p> The Governor 's wife asks , " Who 's that darling girl ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gyla is four , nearly five . She 's dressed as a tiny Snow Queen , though under the costume she is covered with soft , silvery fur . Her face is heart-shaped , with a sharp chin and a rosebud mouth , her head covered with short fur , save two tufts above her temples that mimic a puppy 's ears . <p> Monique leans near and whispers , " You 've never told me about her . " <p> I shake my head . " No , I suppose I have n't . Gyla is a very happy girl . " <p> " What is the matter with her ? " The Governor 's wife 's eyes are narrow , questioning . <p> " She 's a lycanthrope . It 's possible she could bite another child . We may have to isolate her , if her . . . " <p> " That 's horrible ! She 's really very pretty , in an odd way , " Monique says . Her mouth is a tight line . I know what she 's thinking . She 's thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl ? <p> Gyla 's parents were poor Mexican people , Indians , from a state they call Michoacan . Her mother worked in the garment district in Los Angeles , before Gyla was born . After a series of foster placements , she came to Sherman . She speaks with the accent of her foster parents , who were also from Mexico . <p> " She says she wants to be a ballerina , " I say to the Governor 's wife . I pronounce it as Gyla does , " bayareena . " <p> Tears stream down the cheeks of the Governor 's wife , marring her perfectly powdered complexion , as the program draws to a close . I touch her elbow . She stands and claps beside me , as we all do . " What can I do for them , " she says , as she dabs at her eyes with a tissue . Monique is pressing at her arm , muttering how pleased she was to meet her . " What would they like for Christmas ? What would they really like ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Would the children like band-aids , to put across their weeping wounds ? New bodies ? New skin ? The removal of excess eyes and digits and limbs ? Should we get video toys for the blind children , music disks for those who ca n't hear ? Could the Governor 's wife purchase acceptance for them , a society that would n't stare ? <p> " Socks , " I hear myself say . " The children need warm socks . " The Governor 's wife asks how many socks are needed . <p> I tell her there are one hundred and five children , and it would be nice if each child could have two pair , one white , and one colored . Even the children with fins and flippers can use socks . <p> The socks are promised before Christmas . The Governor 's wife kisses me lightly on the cheek , and her handlers lead her away . As she leaves , I feel a tug at my jacket . I look down , and Jonny is beside me . <p> " Will you call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him . " I 'll call her . She 's giving you socks for Christmas , Jonny , " I say . More lies . So simple . I kiss him atop his sensitive head , which is very warm , and Monique and I leave the auditorium . <p> Monique serves me coffee on our patio , which is furnished in the style of wrought iron favored in New Orleans . The cup is hot , the coffee steaming its aroma delicious . Monique makes a magnificent cup of coffee . <p> " Why did you tell her socks ? " she asks as she sits beside me . She has her hair in a sleek ponytail . It makes her look like a young girl . <p> " They need them , " I murmur , as I sip the coffee . <p> " You need a break . Tell the board you want a week off . Two weeks . Let 's get away . Karen can stay with my sister . " Monique 's expression is serious . She pats my hand . It feels as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I pull my hand away . " I ca n't leave now . The staff is continuing class through Christmas . The kids need me . They have n't got homes or families . Jonny still . . . " <p> " Jonny be damned ! Are n't you worth something , Hed ? You ca n't be his father ! I 'm sorry for them , but they 've got to learn to accept what they 've been given . Do n't pretend to be their father . It 's not helping this Jonny . He needs to know there is n't anyone there for him , there is n't . . . " <p> " How can you be so vicious ! " I slam my coffee cup on the table . Ceramic shards spray across my lap , along with most of the coffee . Monique gasps and backs away . I wipe at the mess with the napkin . The look on her face is terrible . I 've frightened her . <p> " You need some time off , Hed . I mean it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Wait , " I say . She tums . I remember how it was for me , long Christmases ago , waiting at our apartment window for my father . My mother always said , " Maybe he 'll come . " Years and years of it , until at last , I did n't go to the window . And he still did n't come . Perhaps that 's why I feel this way about the children . Perhaps this pain is why I can understand their pain . Monique looks at me , questioning . <p> " I 'm sorry , " I say . " It 's because I spent so much time waiting for my own father . " <p> " You told me what happened , " Monique says . Her pale , shiny eyes narrow . " Your mother was too weak to tell the truth , that your father had another family and he 'd stopped caring for you . Do n't make the same mistake with these kids . I may not know very much about the professional parts of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always hurt more than the truth . Always . " Monique swiftly gathered the ceramic chips and spilled coffee with a napkin before she went back in the house . <p> " Maybe you 're right , " I called after her . Monique 's unexpected insight disturbed me . Long ago , I had thought that she loved me . But it had been so long since she was there for me , so many little hurts gathered together , that I could n't remember the way I had once felt . I rested my chin on my cupped hand as I surveyed our pristine yard . <p> " Tell the boy the truth , Hed , " she called from the kitchen window . " And ask for that time off . We need it . " <p> Perhaps I would ask . Jonny 's face appeared in the back of my mind , demanding my attention , like a credit card bill I could n't afford . <p> I walk beside Jonny as he wheels to his dorm . I 've told him that his grandmother wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lip . His third eye rolls aimlessly , the way it always does when he 's angry or upset . I feed a steady stream of tissues from my pocket into his left hand as he steers the chair with the other hand . <p> " I ca n't believe it , Doctor Arlan , " he snuffles . " Why wo n't she come ? " <p> I keep walking , but the chair slows , then stops . Jonny turns . Now comes the hard part . " I do n't know , " I say . This is n't a lie . I not only do n't know why she wo n't come , I do n't know where the grandmother is . All of our letters and notices came back unopened . Her phone was long ago disconnected . <p> " I remember her , " Jonny says . " She said she loved me . She gave me candy . " <p> Though Jonny has n't seen his grandmother since he was three years old , I believe that he does remember her . Many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did , " I say . " Maybe she 's sick , Jonny . Maybe something has happened to her , and we ca n't get in touch with her , to ask her to come . " <p> " You did n't try ! You do n't care ! " Jonny wheels away , furious . My hand is caught in his wheelchair and a large piece of the skin on the back of my hand leaves with him . I swear softly and put my hand to my mouth , then trot after him . Some of the aides stop and stare . I wave them away as I grab his chair . <p> " We did try , Jonny . Maybe something has happened to her . You have to understand . . . " <p> " I do n't understand ! You just want to keep us here . That 's why nobody ever comes , because you 're afraid they 'll take us away ! " Jonny stares at me , his face slick with mucus and tears . His right eye , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forehead , is cast off , fixed somewhere on the wall . The eye from which he sees gazes darkly , fiercely , at me . I turn away . <p> " Sometimes people have things happen , " I say , my voice sounding as feeble as I feel . " My own father never came to see me at Christmas . I waited for him , time after time , but he never came . I wish someone had been able to tell me not to wait , then , the way I 'm telling you now . " <p> " You always lie , " Jonny says . " You told me Gramma was coming last year , and she did n't come . Now you say she ca n't come . " <p> His face is full of childish anger and pain . I try to kiss him atop his head , which is lolling forward at an alarming angle , and he pushes me away . My sore hand throbs . He hits me in the ribs and that hurts , too . <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then he starts down the hall . His wheelchair creaks softly . <p> I murmur soothing things as I follow him to his dorm . He does n't respond . His left arm dangles as he manipulates the chair with the other arm . He enters the dorm and slowly , painfully , transfers from the chair to his bed . I watch through the security window . He does n't cry . Finally , I turn away . I 'll remind the aides to give him something special for Christmas , perhaps a drawing set . He enjoys artwork . I 'm told his pieces are very colorful , though they all look gray to me . <p> Monique has done the Christmas tree in silver and white . She 's obsessed with the new . I remember my childhood trees . The same little toys , the same fading tinsel , the hundred beloved objects , some paper , others glass or plastic , which my mother and I hung with care . Monique adores glamorous trees , the ones with each brand-new ornament carefully matched . Last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and burgundy . At least , I think , as I sip my eggnog and watch our fake gas log fire , I can tell that this year 's tree is silver and white , all the varying shades of the paler portion of the gray scale . <p> Karen is off at some church program . They 're making stockings for poor children . It bothers me that she 's gone , and I 'm alone again with Monique . How old was Karen when Monique began decorating the tree ? Five , six ? Jonny 's age . Was that the age when children began to lose their sense of magic , their trust in the love in the world ? I swirl the nutmeg atop my eggnog , then swallow the whole sweet mess in one gulp . <p> I pour myself another eggnog and add a stiff slug of bourbon . The phone rings . I stay in my chair by the tree , staring at the fire . Monique is in the kitchen . She can get it . <p> I hear her voice . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she brings me the phone . " Here , " she says , thrusting it at me . The antenna stabs my chest . I adjust it and lift it to my car . <p> It 's the charge nurse at Sherman . Something terrible has happened . They 've called an ambulance . <p> " I 'll come , " I say . " I can be there in ten minutes . " <p> " It 's Jonny , " the nurse says . My heart skips a beat . My foot slips a little on the thick rug as I stand . Monique glares . <p> " You 're not going down , are you ? " It 's not a question . <p> " I have to . It 's an emergency , " I say . <p> " You 're drunk . You ca n't drive . I 'll drive you , " she says . <p> Suddenly , I do n't want her with me , her accusing eyes , her porcelain face . I push her aside , grab my keys and I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I 'm at Sherman within ten minutes . I park crookedly in my spot and run into the building . <p> The charge nurse greets me . She leads me toward Dorm A. " I 'm sorry , Dr. Arian , " she says . Her voice is breathless , rushed . " We had a new aide on duty . Christmas Eve , you know . All our experienced people have the night off . He came from a place for autistic children . " <p> We 're drawing closer to the dorm . Children are crying . Some of them are screaming . Nurses and aides crowd outside the dorm , peering through the security window . The charge nurse calls out a warning , and the crowd parts . We enter the dorm . <p> " I ca n't understand why the ambulance is n't here , " she says . Jonny is in his bunk . His leg twitches feebly . I see a huge , dark splash on the wall , his bedding and hair stained the same color . The stain is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of blood . <p> " What has happened to him ? Has someone . . . " <p> " He was beating his head against the wall . All night long . The attendant let it go on , because he was used to autistic children . He did n't realize what could happen . " <p> " He did n't realize how delicate Jonny was , " I whisper . The coppery , sickening smell of blood is everywhere . I push the physician 's assistant away from his feeble searches with a stethoscope , and touch Jonny 's shoulder . It feels cold . He 's bled a tremendous amount , and there is a gaping hole in the side of his head where he must have been hitting the wall . I can see the delicate membrane inside , see where it has tom and the blood and tissue has rushed out . His third eye and the other blind eye stare at me . His one sighted eye faces the bloody bedding . <p> I want to run , but I keep my hand on his shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm sorry . " Then , someone 's strong hand grasps my shoulder . A paramedic . The ambulance has finally arrived . <p> " Move aside , " the paramedic says , then he gets a good look at Jonny and swears under his breath . " Who the hell bashed this kid 's head open ? " Then , he sees the third eye and looks toward me , questioning . <p> " Webern syndrome , " I tell him . The paramedic 's partner brushes by and moves a gurney toward Jonny 's bunk . The noise of their radios , their equipment , and their chatter is disorienting . <p> Someone pushes me in the small of my back . Yet another paramedic . " You need to step aside , " he says . I do , and the charge nurse follows . They lift Jonny 's tiny body from the bed to the gurney . One of the paramedics grimaces and looks away for a brief moment . Even they 're not hardened to boys like Jonny . <p> " He 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one in particular . Then , they 're wheeling him through the crying children . The blood spreads across Jonny 's bunk like the wing of a huge black crow . <p> " We need to call the counselors in , for the children . Look at them , " I tell the charge nurse . The ones still in bed are agitated , flapping their fins back and forth , kicking their stubby flippered legs . The children who can walk are gathered here and there . I hear some trying to comfort the others . One piping voice says , over and over , that Jonny 's going to be okay . Even so , I ca n't get the memory of his head , split like an overripe pumpkin , from my mind . <p> At seven-thirty , the shifts change . I 'm returning to my office when someone hands me a portable phone . Monique is on the line . <p> " We 're not waiting for dinner any longer , " she says . " Karen 's very upset . " <p> I hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , " I tell her . There is a long silence . <p> Monique sighs . " I 'm giving you two hours . If you 're not home by then , I 'm taking Karen to my sister 's , then I 'm leaving for Cabo . I may not . . . " <p> " Jonny 's been taken to the hospital , " I say , the words rushing out . " He might die : There 's massive trauma . " <p> " There 's trauma at home , " Monique says . " What can you do for him ? <p> There 's no point in staying . " Her voice is icy . <p> " You do n't understand . " <p> " I do understand , " she says , very slowly . " You 're killing yourself , Hed . " Someone touches my sleeve . One of the nurses . I hold the phone away . She wants me to go to another counseling session , then check in with the children in the dorm . I put the phone back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> There were more counseling sessions . I oriented the third shift . Then , the hospital called . Jonny was dead . They had not been able to repair his thin , spongy skull . Could I notify his family ? <p> The board of directors keeps a small wet bar in their meeting room . I keep the key . Call his family . I laugh , bitterly , as I open the doors to the wet bar and pour myself a scotch and soda . I 've brought in plenty of ice , from the children 's ice machine . <p> The night wears on . More scotches , more sodas , between conferences with the counselors , the psychologist , the new charge nurse . The ice is gone , and my coffee cup is nearly all scotch , just a splash of muddy institutional java . Amid a meeting I stand awkwardly , mumble something , and rush for the restroom . As I relieve myself , I see my aging belly hanging miserably . It 's gray , gray with dark hair on it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold enamel wall of the stall for what seems like an eternity , before I finally leave . <p> Instead of returning to my office , I stumble into the auditorium and sit in one of the folding chairs . They 've kept the decorations up , the ones the children made for the Governor 's wife . Firemen . Nurses . Doctors . A little train engineer . The fireman held his fire hose between flipper-hands . The nurse had a third eye , very nicely drawn , with long curly lashes . <p> I stare at the figures , until they split and dance before my drunken eyes . My stomach rebels . I 'm afraid I 'm going to be sick , and stagger from the auditorium . I avoid Jonny 's dorm , and return to my office . I call home . No one answers . There is nothing on the machine . I put my head down , just for a moment , and sleep takes me . <p> The morning charge nurse wakes me . She has pale hair , braided tightly at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she says , flinging a piece of paper on my desk . <p> The message is from Monique . " We opened presents by ourselves . I 've gone to Cabo for a week . Karen is with my sister . " <p> I stare at the bit of pink paper . It 's Christmas Day , and Monique is gone , my darling Karen is gone . I crumple the message and look at the gray , hard-carpeted floor . My mouth quivers . Something hot and wet hits my hand . I am crying . <p> As I cry , I hear someone at the door . The nurse again ? I ca n't face her . Her eyes accused me of something , when she left the message . Of what ? Killing Jonny ? Abandoning my wife and child ? The door opens a crack , and I hear a tiny voice , asking to come in . <p> I sniff back the tears . It 's not Jonny , but a little girl . She enters , and touches my leg . Gyla , the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I made this , Doctor Arlan , " she says . She holds out a pretty white ornament , with my name written on it in silvery glitter . She climbs into my lap . <p> " Thank you , " I say . <p> " You 're crying . " She wipes the tears from my cheek with her silver-furred hand . I sigh , and draw her head toward my chest , and stroke her between her tiny pointed ears . <p> " I 'm sad . " <p> " You 're sad because of Jonny , " she says with a child 's simplicity . " We 're all sad too , but we think he 's happy because he went to heaven . " <p> I nod my head . I ca n't speak . She nestles against my chest . She is wearing tiny , cheap tennis shoes that look like ballet slippers on her delicate feet . <p> " I 'm going to dance in all the ballets , when I grow up . " She gives me a big hug . <p> Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes and a sweet rosebud mouth . Karen looked like that , when she was this child 's age . A perfect angel . Gyla 's silvery fur is very beautiful . It shines in the dim light of my office . <p> Gyla does not need these cheap tennis shoes to dance in , I think . She needs slippers , real toe slippers , with ribbons that lace around the ankle . Not pink , but silver to match her silvery fur . <p> " I 'll get you some real ballerina shoes , " I say . I pronounce it " bayareena , " as she does . Children deserve their dreams . I shall not break Gyla 's dream by telling her she pronounces ballerina incorrectly . I stroke her soft fur , and the nape of her neck . She is almost purring . What a lovely child , my little girl . I feel her heart beating against my chest . <p> " I 'll be a beautiful ballerina , and everyone will love me , " she whispers . <p> " Oh yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love you . " Gyla kisses me on rough cheek , but she seems not to notice the stubble . How easily the lies come . How much like the truth they seem . <p> Gyla kisses me again , harder . It feels like I 've cut myself with a razor . She moves away , and I see something dark on her rosebud mouth . I raise my hand to my cheek , then look at my fingers . I see blood , as dark as Jonny 's blood . I put my fingers to my lips . The blood tastes salty and sweet . <p> " Must n't do , my love , " I say . " Ballerinas do n't bite . " <p> Her little brow wrinkles , beneath the fur . She looks at me , wide-eyed . " No ? " It is the Spanish no , more question than statement . <p> I shake my head and hug her once more . " You will have slippers and dresses and tights and everything a little ballerina should have , " I say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a quivering bird in my arms , as she nestles against me , and I rock her in my lap , crooning a little ballerina song , a song she will like , my little girl , my angel , my dear one . <p> <p> By Amy Sterling Casil <p>
