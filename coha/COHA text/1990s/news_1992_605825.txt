<p> R.U. Sirius sat like a lump , but he was staring , eyes boring with the intensity of a laser , a pulsar , a supernova . He seemed very smart . It was as though his mental powers were so exceptionally strong , they had burned off the ends of his hair . Wisps of wisps dangled past his armpits . It was matted too  --  Sirius is n't interested in the biological world  --  just below where his hair stuck to the back of his head . He wore black , totally , including a T-shirt with a portrait of Satan silk-screened on it and high-top Converse sneakers that seemed a tad long in the toe . <p> Queen Mu , by contrast , was vapor , air , loose electricity . She was all giggles . Her smile was half the size of her head . When the photographer asked her to close her mouth , she said , " I ca n't ! " She seemed an unlikely " domineditrix " of a cyberpunk magazine . A light breeze caught her long flower-print @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white shoes . Alice in Wonderland ! She kept riffling through papers and folders and books , piled next to the open window in a wobbling heap , a haystack , an every-which-way jumble . <p> " Why do n't we pay attention to the interview ? " Sirius asked her . <p> " I was looking for something , " Mu said . <p> " Allison , " he said  --  calling her by her real name , " sit down . " <p> High in those dark green hills of Berkeley , far above the university , you will find the headquarters of Mondo 2000 . It is situated pleasantly , in Queen Mu 's large redwood house with tangled vines and tile roof , designed at the turn of the century by the legendary Bay Area architect Bernard Maybeck . There are potted plants inside , alive and dead . There are pieces of mission furniture , mostly inherited by Mu . There are brass oddments , dark wicker , dark rugs . A Franciscan monk 's portrait was hanging above a fireplace . Aside from some Macintosh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the place seems a pre-Raphaelite backdrop . <p> " Yes , " Mu giggled . " Our techno-gothic citadel . " <p> It was Mu who came up with the idea to call the magazine Mondo . It was Sirius who came up with the 2000 . " The name has all the right resonances , " said Mu . Indeed . Gloriously colorful and glossy and ironic and original  --  unusual in so many ways  --  it 's also slightly unfathomable . For one thing , Mondo 2000 likes to pretend we live about 10 years in the future . <p> We 're not new age , they say , but new edge . We are not a magazine , but a mutazine . " It 's not about lifestyle , " said Mu , " but mindstyle . " <p> " Implicit in that word mindstyle , " said Sirius , " is what I was saying before  --  a large portion of our existence now is in data and in media and in stuff that has less to do with our bodies and physical location than it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all technological space . " <p> Computer hackers make up a chunk of the Mondo 2000 readership ( 50,000 copies of the current issue were printed ) . The other chunk must be people who share Sirius 's taste in music , who enjoy reading science fiction novels by William Gibson , contemplating fractals , ordering smart drugs from international purveyors or learning about odd things like how to plug up their left nostrils for 90 minutes at a stretch in order to stimulate the right side of their brains . The mix is masterful . The mix is unique . The mix is Mu and Sirius . <p> The creators embody a certain Bay Area sensibility , the land of new old ideas , still new mostly because they never really get off the ground . Conversation tended to include bits of Carlos Castaneda , Buckminster Fuller , Timothy Leary , Sappho , " Star Trek " and the Warren Report . Mu wandered again and again into talk of sex . Sirius kept up a dialogue about rock-and-roll music , about " downloading my mind into dataspace . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He skipped his politics around the room too . <p> " We are soft-core decadent commercial anarchists , " he explained . <p> Mondo staff members ( called " Mondoids " ) stood around for a group portrait . There was Marcy Walpert , 22 , whose official title is " Ministress of Information . " There was Andrew Hultkrans , 25 , or " The Tall Editor . " There was Jas . Morgan , 30 , the music editor , who joked that while under the influence of smart drugs he can not only hear each note being played during a concert , " but each sound between the notes and the shape of the instrument . " <p> Happily for computer types , Mondo 2000 romanticizes them into valiant cyberpunks , daring electronic-age outlaws . " I think we are making a mythos for people to step into , and fulfill , " said Sirius . " But the creative technological person is out here . " Unlike straight technology magazines like Byte or PC World or PC Computing , it offers hackers cultural solace and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen to have one . There are countless articles about recreational applications for " virtual reality , " although it is important to call this computer technology " VR " now , in the same way that it 's important to say " AI " instead of " artificial intelligence . " <p> And VR , 10 years from now ? <p> Wearing blackout goggles and a Lycra glove , or perhaps a full-body cybersuit , you might be plugging into your PC and mentally inhabiting space there . You might build yourself a room there . And decorate it . You might entertain good-looking friends there . You might fall in love . In Mondo 2000 , there are many , many , many articles about " dildonics , " the term for VR sex . <p> Cybersolutions are everywhere too , for problems from cancer to pollution . The mood is hopeful . The future is a nice place to wind up . The editors live in California , and that is n't easy to forget . " The East Coast of America is really in Europe at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old country back there . It 's a brand new country out here . " <p> There is talk about " surfing " dataspace . There are articles ranging from fringe science to pseudoscience to science fiction . Written in neuro-jargon about transmitters and dendrites and cerebral blood flow , there are updates on smart drugs and how they enhance memory and learning  --  Deprenyl , used to treat Parkinson 's disease ; Piracetam , used to treat stroke victims . In " A Modest Proposal , " Robert Anton Wilson suggests that laboratory experiments not be performed on animals but on cigarette smokers . <p> The language can be impossible . There 's a certain amount of Silicon Valley speak . " Cyber " is stuck in front of anything  --  an all-purpose prefix taken from " cybernetics "  --  to computerize a word . It 's not enough to have a life , you have to have a " cyberlife . " It 's not enough to be a punk , you have to be a " cyberpunk . " Another favorite prefix is " neuro , " as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mind . Other words are given the suffix of " oid "  --  for that special science fiction feeling  --  as in " technoid " or " Mondoid . " Cyber-catchy cute-isms are everywhere , but you can slog along without knowing about much . Just let it wash over you . <p> There 's even a love poem : <p> Let 's surgically merge our organs ; <p> Our kidneys , our lungs , and our hearts ; <p> Let 's read physics journals together <p> And laugh at the dirty parts . <p> Let 's Bell-connect our bellies <p> With some quantum-adhesive glue ; <p> Let 's do new stuff to each other <p> That Newton never knew . <p> It wants to be a quarterly , but with five issues in 2 1/2 years , it 's not there yet . The cover girl of the latest Mondo 2000 , Winter 1992 , is a lovely and massively endowed blonde who turns out to be Fiorella Terenzi , a professor of mathematics and physics at the University of Milan . She is also a music composer who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The interview is strictly astrophysics and frequencies , synthesizers and radio waves . <p> Letters to the editor arrive from around the world , and from all reality states . One regular contributor calls himself Xandor Korzybski , but will not reveal his actual whereabouts to Mu or Sirius because of his own peculiar strain of paranoia . ( Example : Horrible genetic experiments are being conducted , he says , by " the Gray Aliens from outer space who also control the Trilateral Commission . " Korzybski also says AIDS was created by the CIA and refers to our president as " nuclear-winter Bush . " ) <p> A book review of " Three-Fisted Tales of Bob " appeared in the fourth issue . The reviewer was Douglass St. Clair Smith , who is also the editor of " Three-Fisted Tales of Bob . " <p> Have they no journalistic integrity ? <p> " I do n't see us as a journalistic magazine , " explained Sirius . " We are an art form . " <p> " We do n't even want to do reviews , " said Mu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with . " <p> " I think everyone should write their own reviews , " Sirius continued . " I 'm also really good at interviewing myself . " <p> And Mu : " I interviewed myself in Issue 4 ! Nothing like a sympathetic ear ! " <p> Is it true that advertisers get puff pieces written about their products ? <p> " That 's something people like to tar you with , " said Mu . " The puff pieces are usually just about our friends . " <p> Ersatz Realities Queen Mu 's real name is Allison Kennedy . She would n't reveal her age , but she used to be married to a Berkeley professor of Taoism and Buddhism . She does n't drink coffee , because " it contains a natural antagonist for endorphins , " she said . " It also has all the pesticide residues that we 've been dumping in Third World countries , and they 're coming home to us like karmic chickens coming home to roost . They are lodged in the oil fraction of the coffee bean  --  right there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " indirect descendant " of Noah Webster and a " direct descendant " of Mary Todd Lincoln , she said . " And I 'm carrying Mary 's mad genes into the 21st century . " <p> And what about the 21st century ? <p> " I 've been thinking about VR , " she said , " and what it 's going to mean . I think it means that reality as we know it , and our fantasies  --  or our ersatz realities , these new cyber-realities , or virtual realities  --  will become so real that they are almost palpable . They satisfy all the cognitive criteria of reality . At that point  --  and this is the definition of schizophrenia , you know , in the past century , the inability to distinguish between reality and your fantasies  --  when you reach that point , it 's going to signal a very special change in human consciousness . The full implications of that we ca n't even cognize at this moment . " <p> Is she a hacker ? <p> " No , I 'm an anthropologist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should n't admit that . " She giggled wildly . " I am , " she said , giggling more , " a total impostor . I could n't do this without my cyber-amanuensis here . " <p> She pointed at Sirius , who was shrugging . <p> " I 'm not , " he said , " that much of a hacker either , actually . " <p> A Lot More Far Out R.U. Sirius was born Ken Goffman , and he 's 39 . Queen Mu still calls him " Ken " all the time . He used to be a Yippie . He used to be a singer-songwriter also . He grew up in Binghamton , N.Y. , " where IBM is located , " he said . " My father was , like , a tax collector or something . My mother worked for the university . " <p> " His father was a rabid Marxist , " said Mu . <p> " Not really , " said Sirius , " just a liberal . They believed in taxes . I do n't . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm forming a band called Mondo Vanilli . " <p> Sirius first became interested in having a cyberlife in the late ' 60s . " I was interested in the revolutionary effects of technology  --  when people were talking about post-scarcity anarchism , where the machines would do all the work , " he said . " That was something the Yippies really looked forward to , because they did n't want to work . We wanted to believe in this cybernetic vision , that the machines would do it for us . And I maintained that vision , somewhere in the back of my head . I never wanted to do trivial , menial labor , and so the only ethical excuse I could have for my own sensibility was to believe that the machines would do it for me . Otherwise , you 're leaving it up to other people . " <p> In the ' 70s , he was " very influenced by the stuff that Timothy Leary wrote while he was in prison , " he said . " I 'm always attracted to somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at them . Salvador Dali . Andy Warhol . Anybody who most people disapprove of . " <p> Geraldo Rivera ? <p> " Except maybe Geraldo Rivera , " he said . " But I was fascinated with where science and technology was leading , so in the early ' 80s , I married that to psychedelia and brought out a newspaper called High Frontiers . Drugs were very peripheral to all that . If our media and information technologies and digital stuff is really an expression of who we are in a post-biological sense  --  we are moving out beyond our bodies and downloading ourselves into silicon and into media and information  --  then that 's a lot more far out than popping a pill . " <p> Womblike Technologies The logo of Mondo 2000 is the head of a baby  --  eyes maniacal , ears laughing , mouth lush . A nimbus of electric current . <p> " We are being infantilized , wrapped in womblike technologies , " explained Sirius , who then turned to Mu for help . <p> " Why the baby ? " he asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " It 's a great image , " he said . <p> " It came to me in an oracle , " she said . <p> " There 's something about this intelligent looking baby  --  with those tentacles , " said Sirius . " It 's the electric baby . That 's our kid . It 's certainly not the Gerber baby . " <p> " It came to me , spoke to me , " said Mu . " It has powerful resonances . We all grew up with the Gerber baby . In the ' 60s , the successor was the baby in ' 2001 . ' And then , finally , as a basic piece of Americana , there 's the New Year 's baby . " <p> " Who ? " asked Sirius . <p> " The New Year 's baby , " said Mu . <p> " The baby who comes in with the new year , " someone else said . " The old year is the old man with the crook . " <p> Sirius was silent , as though trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Learn something new every interview . " <p> " Powerful subconscious semiotics , " said Mu . " It speaks deeply . It 's Cyber Baby . " <p> A Digital Pollyanna As she showed the way to the door  --  and this was sad , because it 's the sort of place you could imagine crashing for a weekend  --  Queen Mu handed over a cassette tape of music that she happily described as " homo-erotic . " She smiled hugely . Her teeth themselves are huge too , so the effect was quite something . Half her head . She said she was looking forward to the future . <p> " I 'm a new age Pollyanna , " she said . " A digital Pollyanna . " <p> The future . <p> What 's it going to be like ? <p> " I 'm upbeat in the final analysis , " said Sirius , smiling too . <p> What does he look forward to most ? " The cure of venereal diseases and the free passage of RU 486 and the orgiastic end of the 20th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " And the Dionysiac revival ! Techno-paganism ! " <p> " And I 'm looking forward to Mondo Vanilli 's version of ' I Am the Walrus ' becoming a number one hit , " said Sirius . " And after that happens , being able to spend , like , an entire year sitting in a hotel room smoking cigarettes and watching cable TV. "
