<p> American campaign fund-raisers and donors squirming under the glare of those rude probes and revelations should come to Britain . Here , it is all very polite . <p> There are no limits on who can give and how much they can give to the parties . Foreigners are welcome . The Conservatives have a club  --  the Dragon Club  --  set up especially to get money from the Far East . <p> The same goes for corporate contributions . Indeed , corporations queue up like faithful tithers to give their share , in cash and in kind . <p> And , in the campaign that has just begun , as in all those before , no one has to worry about disclosure requirements : There are none . Nor is anyone likely to be accused of breaking campaign finance laws . There are none of those either . And if you accept the terminology of a 1994 House of Commons committee , which decided that no such laws were necessary , neither is there any such thing as a campaign donor ; there are only " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Britain 's world of campaign finance is questions : " Oh , nobody 's going to talk to you about that , " said a Conservative Party spokeswoman fielding a request to interview party treasurers and money-raisers . <p> The Labor Party was somewhat more forthcoming . It is proud that it voluntarily discloses contributions above 5,000 pounds ( about $ 8,000 ) and promptly provided a list of donors . But it was a year out of date and did not say how much more than 5,000 pounds each contributed . <p> What Labor will not disclose are contributors to the special office fund of its leader , Tony Blair . That is in a blind trust , and neither he nor anyone else can see it . More than half of Labor 's money comes from trade unions , according to the party 's financial report . <p> British politicians take pride in the fact that their general election campaigns are far less costly than those in the United States , largely because paid television advertising is prohibited . " There seems no doubt that you spend an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Byron Shafer , an Oxford University political scientist . " It is also true that it is all unregulated here . Things that were illegal in the United States a long time ago are done and not recorded here . " <p> But if there is a lesson here for the United States in lowering campaign costs ( by providing free TV time , for example , ) it is that parties will still raise as much as possible from those who have a stake in government policies . The two major parties will spend an estimated $ 90 million on the campaign  --  for ad agencies , newspaper ads , billboards , pollsters , mailings , staff salaries and travel . And corporate titans still find it worth $ 150,000 to join a " Premier Club " that gets to dine twice a year with the prime minister . <p> If there are lessons for British politicians in their opaque fund-raising , it is that they do not prevent allegations of scandalous practices in the press . In fact , since party officials rarely comment on who does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of contributions , the press publishes more or less what it pleases on the subject , with little fear of public contradiction . <p> The absence of disclosure laws does not prevent disclosure . Stories appear when disappointed or disaffected suitors decide to get even . Mohammed Al Fayed , the owner of Harrods department store , revealed in 1994 that he had given the Tories nearly $ 400,000 while lobbying government trade officials for a favorable decision on a takeover bid he was making . <p> The Conservatives have been getting pounded in the press for several years now , since the administrators of a collapsed business empire called Polly Peck International revealed that some $ 700,000 of company funds went into the party 's treasury . The company 's head  --  a Turkish Cypriot named Asil Nadir  --  is a fugitive from justice . Unlike the Democratic National Committee , which has rushed to return tainted money , the Conservatives have repeatedly declined to do so . <p> In politics , as in life in Britain , " money is a dirty subject , " said Patrick Seyd , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're all obsessed with it but we do n't talk about it . " <p> Privacy in campaign finance is the official view of the House of Commons , as expressed in a 1994 report of the committee that decided no changes were needed in Britain 's campaign finance laws . Party funding , said the majority report , is " an area where the idea of total transparency is for practical reasons unattainable , and in principle even undesirable . . . . The financial integrity of British public life is still , thankfully , such that a requirement of this kind is not necessary . " <p> In a " free society which cherishes the secret ballot , " it said , " we believe that it would be wrong to oblige the disclosure of commitment to a political party by a requirement to identify financial benefactors . " <p> Despite more press allegations of shady contributions , that has remained the attitude . Citing reports of " criminal , semi-criminal and foreign money " showing up in party treasuries , Roy Jenkins , a onetime chancellor of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried but failed to gain any support for a reexamination of the country 's campaign funding secrecy . <p> Fund-raising ? " It 's very boring , " said Alistair McAlpine , Conservative Party treasurer from 1975 to 1990 , who has since become a renegade critic of the Tories and author of a book he unashamedly entitled " Once a Jolly Bagman . " <p> " Fund-raising here is about trudging around the country getting money from people . Very predictable people . Industrial fund-raising , " as he calls getting money from companies , " used to be about 300 quid pounds per company . It 's gone up considerably . " <p> It has indeed . Labor Party research , taken from corporate records and uncontradicted by the Conservatives , shows that corporate donations of $ 150,000 or more are not unusual , and that contributions in the range of $ 50,000 to $ 75,000 are common . Press reports here  --  neither confirmed nor denied by the Conservatives  --  say that individual contributions reach into the millions . The Sunday Times recently reported a donation of $ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an anonymous gift . " <p> McAlpine said in an interview that his only regret , in hindsight , is that he accepted money from Nadir , the Turkish Cypriot businessman who ultimately donated the $ 700,000 . The only tacky moment McAlpine recalls  --  with some relish , since he has become an enemy of John Major  --  is Major asking him to solicit a $ 750,000 contribution from a foreign businessman , identified in numerous press reports here as Greek shipping tycoon John Latsis . Major denies it . " I have not asked Alistair McAlpine to approach people for money , " he said , in the same interview . " I do not involve myself in that fashion . " <p> In fact , party fund-raising , like so many other aspects of life in Britain , is a clubby affair . There is the Premier Club , for donors of $ 150,000 or more , who get invited to private dinners with Major . There 's the Millennium Club , for lesser but substantial donors , who get only dinners with ministers of the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups of business people who donate and get other friendly business people to donate . <p> " These are not secret clubs , " said the Conservative Party spokeswoman . " They 're perfectly legitimate ones which raise money for the party . " <p> For all the stories alleging shady contributions , the issue of campaign finance does not even register in polls listing the matters that most concern the nation . And the press itself is divided editorially on calls for a change in practice . <p> " A lack of limits on what the parties can spend nationally , rather than in individual constituencies districts , has meant that national spending has climbed quickly over the past two decades , " the Economist news magazine said recently . " As spending rises , the case for disclosure becomes ever stronger . " <p> " Politicians ought not to accept donations from unknown sources , lest the money turns out to be morally tainted , " said the Tory-oriented Daily Telegraph as it chastised the Labor Party for its leader 's " blind trust . " <p> " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from acceptable , known donors ( including foreign ones ) on the understanding that their identity will not be made public , " it said , " so long as the party does not reward the donor . . . . There is no need for more elaborate rules . "
