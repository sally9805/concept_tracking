<p> It was late and he came alone . He hovered in the portico , a swollen Romeo , his face a loose collection of lines and mottled puff . <p> Old family friends had invited Edward Kennedy to their 40th-anniversary dinner in Woodley Park in June . The couple 's daughter , the hostess , opened the door . Kennedy , 60 , had seen Victoria Reggie many times before : as a girl while campaigning for JFK in Louisiana , as a teenager during visits to her parents ' Nantucket summer home , as a college woman when she interned for him on the Hill . Now a 38-year-old lawyer , she set hazel eyes on him and lobbed : <p> " What 's the matter , you could n't get a date ? " <p> A few days later , he got one . With her . <p> There on the doorstep , teasing the aging senator , stood the answer to the question pestering Washington since the couple announced their engagement : What kind of woman would marry Ted " midnight romp " Kennedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of two . Ripe with childhood memories of good , brave Kennedys , Reggie could love this man of great achievement and great disappointment . <p> " Vicki is hilarious , and he wants to laugh , " says Peter Edelman , who has known Kennedy since 1965 . <p> He could use a laugh . Kennedy 's past year reads like panels from a " Life in Hell " cartoon : Good Friday in Au Bar , testifying at his nephew 's rape trial , his son 's admission to an alcohol treatment center , his apparent out-of-body experience during the Thomas-Hill hearings , his plunge in approval ratings in Massachusetts , his public apology at Harvard for less-than-senatorial behavior . <p> Then , snapshot  --  the happy groom . Cynics wonder about the bride . Gold digger ? Bimbo ? Bozo ? Pawn in a Kennedy political maneuver to regain respectability ? <p> None of the above , say those who know her . <p> " When you see them together , it 's different than anything he 's had before , " says a longtime Kennedy aide . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life with . I think she was looking for that very much , " says Dawn Alexander , a first-year associate at Reggie 's law firm , Keck , Mahin and Cate . " Like all divorced women with two kids at 38 , she 's interested in not living the rest of her life alone . " <p> And as for Kennedy 's reputation , " it comes down to believing what you read or what you know about Ted . My sister will be a Kennedy ; that 's not a scary thing , " says Reggie 's sister , Alicia Freysinger . " Our families have been friends forever . I know who he is . She knows who he is . " <p> Neither Kennedy nor Reggie would talk . But interviews with friends , colleagues and family jig saw a portrait of an outgoing , intelligent woman not likely to repose in Kennedy 's ample shadow . From her dark wavy hair to her bold personality , the 5-foot-8 Reggie is a perfect foil to Kennedy 's first wife , Joan , a fragile blonde who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who drank heavily and for whom the bruising Kennedy world was often too much . <p> " Vicki can handle the tremendous scrutiny and pressure this life brings , " says Reggie 's friend , Barbara Smith . " Some people might find Vicki too direct , but Kennedy enjoys her strong-mindedness , " Smith says . Kennedy jokes that Reggie is the only person in his life who takes three hours to return his calls . <p> A perfectionist on the job and at home , Reggie slogs through a morass of savings-and-loan cases at the law firm , where she is a partner , and churns dirt in her garden to grow dill and basil for spaghetti sauce . She is a Stairmaster regular , an opera fan and a Redskins season-ticket holder , pops books like after-dinner mints and does a fine Cajun crawfish etouffe . <p> " She 's a typical working mother , doing what most men could not do , " says Steve Engelberg , who has worked with Reggie at the Washington office of Keck , Mahin since she joined the firm in 1987 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 725,000 brick colonial on a street where the birds out-clamor the cars . She keeps a summer home in Nantucket . Her children from her first marriage , Curran , 9 , and Caroline , 6 , have a nanny and attend the Maret School ( annual tuition : $ 10,500 each ) . <p> Her sharp mind and sensual looks  --  drop her name around fiftyish men and they grow wistful and go off the record : " Put it this way , when she walks into a room you pay attention , " says a colleague  --  make her a Washington dinner party staple . " I would n't think of having a party without her , " says Smith . " She 's my back-up hostess ... and she does n't shy away from controversy . " Like the time she launched into politics with a staunchly Republican couple at a table full of pedigree Democrats . " She does it without alienating people , " says Engelberg . " It 's her charm . " Charm , warmth , poise  --  the words come up a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Alexander . " You think of high-power women as being snooty , but her gleam and glow ... she could teach male attorneys to be nicer . " <p> Reggie hails from Crowley , La. , pop . 17,000 , land of crawfish and rice outside the Atchafalaya Swamp . She is the second of six children in a traditional Catholic family of Lebanese descent . Her mother , Doris , an heiress to the Bunny Bread fortune , is a Democratic national committeewoman . Her father , Edmund , is a longtime Louisiana politician , retired city judge and confidant of Gov . Edwin Edwards . He is a dyed-in-the-wool Democrat who fed his children politics at dinner and yelled , " Last one in is a Republican ! " to get them tumbling into the family pool . <p> Like the Kennedy clan , the extended Reggies are a tight weave . Growing up , Reggie spent Sundays gathered with 16 cousins at her grandmother 's house , feasting on grape leaves and tabouli . When the kids went off to college , Reggie 's parents put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Crowley daily and calls her siblings several times a week . <p> High school valedictorian , Phi Beta Kappa at Sophie Newcomb College and law review editor at Tulane 's law school , Reggie was " the shining star in the family , the one with all the brains , " says her cousin , Fred Reggie of Lafayette . Early on , she set her sights on law school . The Reggies built a 19-seat movie theater with a popcorn machine in their back yard , and " all the kids would be out there on a weeknight , " says her father . " Except Vicki , who would slip out to do her homework . " <p> In college she spent late nights with pints of ice cream and volumes of Shelley and Keats . Reggie studied 19th-century literature , but " she was very 20th or 21st century , " says her sorority sister , Karen Kilgore . " No marriage on the brain . " When Reggie did date , it was always with " smart , popular , outgoing guys ... certainly not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first husband , Grier Raclin , a Washington telecommunications lawyer , while they clerked together in the federal district court in Chicago . Their 1981 church wedding , the talk of Crowley , feted 400 guests with a week 's worth of parties . The couple divorced in July 1990 . Raclin agreed to pay $ 4,150 per month in child support and $ 1,000 per month in alimony , according to court documents . Vicki Reggie got their Washington and Nantucket homes and the family 's Ford Taurus and is the " principal residential parent " of their two children . The settlement is valid until June , and is reportedly being negotiated . <p> " She was definitely looking for someone different from Grier , " Kilgore says of Reggie 's choice in a second husband . " Ted is handsome and successful and outgoing like her . Grier is a little quieter . " <p> The Reggies and Kennedys first hooked up at the 1956 Democratic convention in Chicago . Edmund helped deliver Louisiana 's votes to John Kennedy . In 1959 , when JFK was shoring up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annual rice festival and brought out a crowd of 100,000 . Edmund campaigned vigorously in Louisiana for JFK in 1960 , for Bobby in 1968 and for Ted in 1980 . " He was our man in Louisiana , " says Frank Mankiewicz , Bobby 's former press secretary . " He was our man for the South . " <p> When Ted came through town , he impressed everyone , says Fred Reggie : " I remember being awestruck by him , a man of great political and physical stature . " Vicki remembers Ted from those days , says her sister , Alicia , but " she never talked about him as cute . " And when Kennedy visited her family in Nantucket over the years , " they saw each other but did n't see each other , " says her father . " Never in a hundred years did I think that they 'd get married . " <p> Until last June . Kennedy sent his driver to pick her up for their first date at a Capitol Hill restaurant and kept a phone on the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in late session , so in between courses he ran back to the floor to vote . <p> The courtship was intense . Banish the image of Kennedy as womanizer , boozer and public boor , friends say ; the man Reggie fell for is " extraordinarily attentive . " <p> " For 10 years he was n't ready to make that kind of commitment , " says Doris Kearns Goodwin , a part-time Kennedy speech writer . <p> Kennedy sent Reggie hundreds of rose bouquets and spring flowers . He calls her constantly and sends love notes . He takes her sailing . Treats her to dinners and shows at the Kennedy Center . Includes her friends and respects her opinions . He plays tennis with her son , Curran , and colors on the floor with Caroline . He reads them to sleep . Took them trick or treating on Halloween . <p> " There was Teddy standing behind the kids , " says V.V. Rankine , a surprised neighbor . " I had lollipops for the kids . I gave him nothing .

" By Christmas , Reggie hinted to her college friend that an engagement was in the works . And by Kennedy 's 60th-birthday party in February , the couple were dressing up as a mouse and cheese , as Rhett Butler and Scarlett O'Hara . Four days later , Kennedy threw Vicki a Lebanese-style birthday party and filled his McLean mansion with flags and food of Lebanon . <p> Within the year , the mansion will be her home . There is no rock yet . The wedding will be tiny . And the church does not approve . Neither do Kennedy 's critics , who say Reggie is to Kennedy what Gorham polish is to tarnished silver . <p> " She 's not quite the ABA endorsement , " says Peter Collier , co-author of " The Kennedys : An American Drama .

Reggie 's father is under federal indictment on 11 counts of alleged bank fraud for $ 4 million worth of questionable transactions . Edmund denies the charges . He will stand trial on May 27 . <p> But then again , what 's a trial , a niggling little scandal , between old friends ?
