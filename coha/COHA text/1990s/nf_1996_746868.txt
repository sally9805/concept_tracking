Summary <p> Background The risk of having a first cirrhosis-associated variceal bleed is lowered by about 50% by b-blockers . Use of b-blockers is currently recommended for patients with cirrhosis and oesophageal varices that are at risk of bleeding . We aimed to test the effectiveness of isosorbide mononitrate as an adjunct to the b-blocker nadolol in the prophylaxis of first variceal bleeding in these patients . <p> Methods We did a randomised multicentre study to compare the non-selective b-blocker , nadolol , with nadolol plus isosorbide mononitrate in 146 relatively well ( Child-Pugh score &lt;/=11 ) patients who had oesophageal varices at risk of bleeding . Patients on nadolol alone received a single oral 40 mg daily dose . Every second day the dose was titrated to achieve 20-25% decrease in resting heart rate ( maximum dose 160 mg daily ) . Patients receiving both drugs received nadolol as above then isosorbide mononitrate was added starting with 10 mg orally twice daily , which was increased to 20 mg unless hypotension or severe headache occurred . The main endpoint was the occurrence of variceal bleeding of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months . <p> Findings During the study period 11 of 74 patients from the nadolol alone group and four of 72 from the nadalol plus isosorbide mononitrate group had variceal bleeding ( log-rank test p=0.03 ) . Cumulative risk of variceal bleeding was 18% in the nadolol group and 7.5% in the combined treatment group ( 95% CI for difference 1-25% ) . Two patients in each group had a non-variceal bleed related to portal hypertension. 14 patients from the nadolol only group and eight from the combined treatment group died during the study period ( log-rank test p=0.09 ) . Four and eight patients , respectively , had to discontinue one of the drugs because of side-effects . <p> Interpretation Nadolol plus isosorbide mononitrate is signifcantly more effective than nadolol alone in the primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding in relatively well patients with cirrhosis , and has few side-effects . <p> Lancet 1996 ; 348 : 1677-81 Introduction <p> Haemorrhage from ruptured oesophageal varices is one of the most serious complications of cirrhosis , leading to death in a third of patients with this complication , 1 and accounting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower the risk of having a first bleed and of rebleeding from oesophageal varices by about 50%. 3 , 4 The use of b-blockers is currently recommended for patients with cirrhosis and varices that are at risk of bleeding. 5 Greater effectiveness of b-blockers , however , would be desirable . One possible reason for ineffectiveness of treatment is an insufficient decrease in portal pressure , 6-8 which could be corrected by the addition of long-acting nitrates. 9 , 10 Isosorbide mononitrate enhances the portal hypotensive effect of b-blockers , 11 , 12 and decreases the number of patients classified as poor responders according to haemodynamic criteria. 11 This drug may therefore be a useful adjunct to b-blockers in the treatment of portal hypertension . No clinical trial has yet assessed the effectiveness of long-acting nitrates to b-blockers in primary prophylaxis . <p> We did a multicentre clinical trial to compare the non-selective b-blocker , nadolol alone with nadolol plus isosorbide mononitrate in the primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis and oesophageal varices that were at risk of bleeding . Patients and methods <p> From December , 1991 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recruited from in patients and outpatients seen in nine centres in Italy . Eligible patients had a diagnosis of cirrhosis , were aged 18-70 years , had oesophageal varices classified as F2 or F3 13 irrespective of the presence of red weal marks , or of varices classified as F1 which had red weal marks , and had no previous variceal bleeding . Diagnosis of cirrhosis was based on histological tests done either at enrolment onto the study or at previous admission or evidence of oesophageal varices and signs of unequivocal liver damage ( abnormal values of at least three serum albumin , serum bilirubin , prothrombin index , alkaline phosphatase , and g-globulins ) , found at enrolment or at a previous admission . The exclusion criteria were previous treatment for portal hypertension ( medical or endoscopic ) ; Child-Pugh score 14 of liver disease severity higher than 11 points ; presence of any neoplastic disease ; inability to attend follow-up ( eg , patients living outside the catchment area of each centre , or who showed poor compliance to treatment for other conditions ) ; contraindications to b-blockers ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with heart rate&lt;50 beats/min , arterial hypotension with systolic blood pressure &lt;85 mm Hg , heart failure , asthma , peripheral arterial disease , or diabetes needing insulin treatment ) or long-acting nitrates ( glaucoma ) ; concomitant or recent treatment with interferon for hepatitis B or C. <p> The study protocol conformed with the Helsinki Declaration , and was approved by the local ethics authorities . Informed consent was obtained from all participants . According to these criteria 146 eligible patients were recruited from a group of 313 patients considered for the study . Reasons for exclusion ( figure 1 ) were previous treatment for portal hypertension in 52 , Child-Pugh score higher than 11 in 44 patients , tumour in 24 patients , inability to attend follow-up in nine patients , and contraindications in 38 patients . Interobserver agreement of participating endoscopists , assessed before the study began , was adequate according to k statistics ( for size of varices k=0.68 ; for red weal marks k=0.45 ) . <p> The study was a single-blind , randomised multicentre study , stratified according to participating centres . Randomisation was generated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , prepared at the University of Padua , and administered by sealed , opaque , and consecutively numbered envelopes . Immediately after randomisation , the patients started treatment . <p> Patients allocated nadolol alone received the drug orally starting with a dose of 40 mg daily as a single dose . Every second day , the dose was titrated to achieve a 20-25% decrease in resting heart rate . The maximum dose administered was 160 mg daily . Once the desired dose was achieved , a placebo tablet was added . <p> Patients allocated nadolol plus isosorbide mononitrate recieved nadolol by the same protocol as the nadolol alone group at first , then isosorbide mononitrate was added starting with10 mg twice daily , which was increased to 20 mg twice daily , unless hypotension ( systolic blood pressure &lt;/=85 mm Hg ) or severe headache occurred . <p> Patients were followed-up once a month for the first 3 months , then every 3 months . Compliance was assessed by measurement of heart rate , and enquiry about how often patients did not take their medication . Patients who failed to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed no decrease in heart rate more than once , were classified as non-compliant . The study ended in April , 1995 , when the first enrolled patient had reached 40 months of follow-up . Median follow-up in censored patients was 30 months . <p> The main endpoint of the study was the occurrence of variceal bleeding . Other endpoints were side-effects that required withdrawal of patients from treatment , death , and occurrence of non-variceal bleeding . All patients with upper-gastrointestinal bleeding were investigated by emergency endoscopy . A diagnosis of variceal bleeding was made if varices were actively bleeding , or if there was a clot on a varix , or if no other possible origin of the bleed could be found . Bleeding from portal hypertensive gastropathy ( ie , non-variceal bleeding related to portal hypertension ) was diagnosed when such lesions were seen actively bleeding or had signs of recent bleeding ( fibrin clots or black-brown spots ) . Variceal bleeding was treated with sclerotherapy , and medical treatment was discontinued when varices appeared to have gone . Side-effects necessitating withdrawal from the study were : hypotension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart failure , atrioventricular block greater than first degree , asthma , hepatic encephalopathy untreatable with disaccharides , and diabetes needing more than 20 U insulin . In patients receiving isosorbide mononitrate intolerable headache was also judged to be a side-effect necessitating cessation of that drug . Patients with side-effects related to b-blockers continued with placebo or isosorbide mononitrate , according to randomisation , patients with side-effects related to isosorbide mononitrate continued on nadolol alone . All patients were included in the analysis according to the intention-to-treat principle . <p> Statistical analysis <p> We estimated that patients with oesophageal varices that were at risk of bleeding , who were being treated with nadolol would have a 31% chance of variceal bleeding during follow-up , and that the minimum clinically relevant effect was the decrease of this risk to 12% . According to these estimates , with a=0.05 , b=0.20 , and a two-sided test , we calculated the required sample size to be about 145 patients . <p> To assess adequacy of randomisation , groups were compared with chi 2 test or Student 's t test , when applicable . Risks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of death from any cause , and of death from liver-related causes were calculated with Kaplan-Meier plots , and compared by log-rank test . The number of patients needed to prevent one bleed was calculated according to Jaeschke and colleagues , whereby one is divided by the absolute decrease in risk. 15 To assess the possible influence of other prognostic variables as confounding factors in determining risk of bleeding or of death , Cox 's regression analysis was used . Confounding factors assessed were size of varices , red weal marks , and Child-Pugh score . Both forward and backward selection procedures were by the maximum partial likelihood ratio test to assess the significance probability of each variable to be entered or removed . The assumption of proportionality of risk with time was checked by inspecting log minus log survivor function plots . Results <p> Randomisation ( figure 1 ) gave two groups : 74 patients for nadolol alone and 72 patients for nadolol plus isosorbide mononitrate . All patients were well matched for demographic , clinical , biochemical , and endoscopic characteristics ( table ) . <p> Six patients ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nadolol plus isosorbide mononitrate group ) were lost to follow-up after 4 months of treatment . Four patients in the nadolol group and three patients from the nadolol plus isosorbide mononitrate group had to be withdrawn from treatment because of b-blocker related side-effects ( one asthma , two atrioventricular block , one heart failure , respectively ) . five patients had to be withdrawn from isosorbide mononitrate treatment because of severe headache . All these patients continued treatment with the other drug without further side-effects . Side-effects due to b-blockers mainly occurred during the first months of treatment ( range 1-10 months ) . Side-effects because of nitrates occurred after the first few doses of the drugs . All side-effects disappeared promptly after discontinuation of the relevant drug . <p> Minor side-effects which did not call for withdrawal from treatment were dizziness ( five cases in the nadolol alone group and six cases in the combined treatment group ) , nightmares ( one case in the nadolol plus isosorbide mononitrate group ) , transient impotence ( one case in the nadolol group ) , and minor headache , which subsided after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nadolol plus isosorbide mononitrate group ) . Compliance was judged inadequate in five of the nadolol alone patients and in four of the combined treatment patients . For the nadolol alone group heart rate decreased from 79 ( SD 9 ) beats/min at baseline , to 58 ( 5 ) beats/min at 6 months , to 60 ( 4 ) beats/min at 1 year , to 61 ( 5 ) beats/min at 2 years . For the combined treatment group heart rate decreased from 80 ( SD 7 ) beats/min at baseline , to 61 ( 7 ) beats/min at 6 months , to 59 ( 5 ) beats/min at 1 year , to 60 ( 6 ) beats/min at 2 years . <p> During the study period 11 patients on nadolol alone and four on nadolol and isosorbide mononitrate had a variceal bleed . The cumulative risk of variceal bleeding at the end of the study period was 18% in the nadolol group and 7.5% in the nadolol plus isosorbide mononitrate group ( log-rank test : p=0.03 ; figure 2 ) . The difference in risk was 10.5% ( 95% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be treated to prevent a single bleed was 10 . This number is a measure of treatment effect and results from the reciprocal of the absolute decrease in risk . The cumulative risk of bleeding was lowered by more than 50% in the nadolol plus isosorbide mononitrate group . The number of transfusions required during bleeds was similar in the two groups ( mean 4 SD 3 vs 4 2 ; p=0.75 ) , and 40-day mortality after bleeding was two of 11 ( 18% ) and one of four ( 25% ) , respectively ( p=0.85 ; Fisher 's exact test ) . <p> When size of varices , extent of red weal marks , and Child-Pugh score were tested as possible confounding factors 16 according to Cox 's regression analysis , treatment ( b=21.20 SE 0.58 , p=0.03 ) and size of varices ( 0.98 0.49 , p=0.04 ) were the only prognostic variables predictive of bleeding . The value of the b-coefficients for treatments implies an odds ratio in patients treated with nadolol versus nadolol plus isosorbide mononitrate of 3.33 ( 95% CI 1.05-10.1 )  --  ie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ varices being equal . <p> During follow-up two and three patients , respectively , experienced a non-variceal bleed . Two patients in each group bled from portal hypertensive gastropathy , and one patient in the nadolol plus isosorbide mononitrate group bled from aspirin-induced gastric lesions that occurred after analgesic treatment received for an arm fracture . The cumulative risk of non-variceal bleeding at theend of the study period was 4% in the nadolol group and 5% in the combined treatment group ( log-rank test : p=0.70 ) . The cumulative risk of bleeding related toportal hypertension ( varices and portal hypertensive gastropathy ) at the end of the study period was 21.2% and 12% , respectively ( log-rank test : p=0.04 ; figure 2 ) . <p> 22 patients died during the study period , 14 from the nadolol group and eight from the nadolol plus isosorbide mononitrate group . two patients and one patient , respectively , died of variceal bleeding . Nine patients and six patients , respectively , died of other liver-related causes ; among them , three patients from each group developed hepatocellular carcinoma during follow-up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-liver related causes ( accident , lymphoma , myocardial infarction , lung tumour ) . The cumulative probability of overall survival was 0.79 in the nadolol group , and 0.84 in the nadolol plus isosorbide mononitrate group ( log-rank test : p=0.09 ; figure 3 ) . The cumulative probability of not dying from liver disease was 0.83 and 0.85 , respectively ( log-rank test : p=0.16 ) . When Child-Pugh score was a possible confounding factor in predicting mortality , treatment was not a significant predictor of death or of death from liver-related causes ( p=0.35 and p=0.47 , respectively ) , according to Cox 's multiple regression analysis . Discussion <p> We compared the non-selective b-blocker , nadolol , with the nadolol plus isosorbide mononitrate , the active metabolite of isosorbide dinitrate formed by the liver , which has a longer half-life 17 , 18 and less tendency to provoke hypotension 19 than the parent drug . <p> The observed risk of variceal bleeding among patients recieving nadolol alone ( 18% ) is in the lower range of those reported in patients treated with non-selective b-blockers in placebo-controlled trials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By contrast the observed risk of variceal bleeding among patients on combined therapy was 7.5% at the end of the study . This significant decrease in the risk of bleeding was maintained when possible confounding factors , such as severity of liver dysfunction , size of oesophageal varices , or presence of red weal marks were taken into account by Cox 's regression analysis . From the coefficients of Cox 's regression analysis one can also estimate that the decrease in risk obtained with combined therapy was greater than that corresponding to a decrease in variceal size from F3 to F2 . Therefore the addition of isosorbide mononitrate to treatment represents an important advance in the prophylaxis of bleeding from varices , being of about the same degree as that of b-blockers to untreated patients . When the four cases of portal hypertensive gastropathy were combined with variceal bleedings , the risk of bleeding in patients allocated nadolol plus isosorbide mononitrate was also significantly lower than that of patients randomised to nadolol alone . Since need for transfusion and death rates from bleeding were nearly identical , the severity of bleeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of death was only slightly lowered by the addition of isosorbide mononitrate in this study because there were few deaths related to bleeding . Since the aim of treatment was to decrease portal pressure , and consequently to lower the risk of bleeding , the therapy could conceivably improve survival only by decreasing the risk of death from bleeding . The number of patients to be investigated would have to have been much larger , if survival were the main endpoint. 20 , 21 However , bleeding is often followed by complications , such as hypotension , thrombocytopenia , and decline in liver function . Treatment could also have helped to prevent all of these complications . <p> Side-effects related to b-blockers were infrequent ( six of 146 patients ) , and promptly disappeared on discontinuation of the drug . The low rate of side-effects may be related to the strict protocol of selection , according to which 38 patients with contraindications to b-blockers were excluded . Five patients of the 72 allocated nadolol and isosorbide mononitrate could not continue isosorbide mononitrate treatment because of severe and intolerable headache . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nitrates . The frequency of headache that we found is similar to that reported in patients receiving long-acting nitrates for coronary heart disease. 19 , 22 This is a limitation for the use of the combined therapy . However , we suggest that the benefits are far outweighed by the drawbacks . <p> As in any clinical trial , the results of this study can be generalised only to patients similar to those who took part . Therefore , our observation applies only to relatively well patients with cirrhosis , since the mean Child-Pugh score was between 7 and 8 points . Indeed , these patients may have a clearer clinical benefit than more severly ill patients , since in the latter most deaths are related to liver failure and can not be prevented by the treatment . <p> The combination of nadolol and isosorbide mononitrate is more effective than nadolol alone in preventing variceal bleeding in relatively well patients with cirrhosis . This observation should be confirmed in future clinical trials . <p> <p> Steering Committee of GTIP <p> A Gatta ( University of Padua , Padua , Italy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , L Borsato ( Dolo General Hospital , Dolo ) , N Caruso ( Adria General Hospital , Adria ) , R Cielo ( Belluno General Hospital , Belluno ) , G DeVenuto ( Trento General Hospital , Trento ) , G Dobrilla ( Bolzano General Hospital , Bolzano ) , V Donadon ( Pordenone General Hospital , Pordenone ) , C Merkel ( University of Padua , Padua ) , P Spandri ( Schio General Hospital , Schio ) . <p> Clinical investigators <p> P Angeli ( University of Padua , Padua ) , A Bellumat ( Belluno General Hospital , Belluno ) , P Beltrame ( Schio General Hospital , Schio ) , P Brosolo ( Udine General Hospital , Udine ) , L Caregaro ( University of Padua , Padua ) , G Cavallarin ( Chioggia General Hospital , Chioggia ) , S Cuppini ( Adria General Hospital , Adria ) , C Donada ( Pordenone General Hoapital , Pordenone ) , M Felder ( Bolzano General Hospital , Bolzano ) , R Marin ( Dolo General Hospital , Dolo ) , C Mazzaro ( Pordenone General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Padua , Padua ) , G Sebastinelli ( Belluno General Hoapital , Belluno ) , S Susanna ( Adria General Hospital , Adria ) , P Torboli ( Trento General Hospital , Trento ) , P Zanella ( Schio General Hospital , Schio ) . <p> Statistical analysts <p> P Amodio , E Enzo , C Merkel ( University of Padua , Padua ) <p> Acknowledgments <p> The study was supported by grants from the Italian Ministry of University and Scientific Research ( national liver cirrhosis and viral hepatitis project ) and from the Italian Liver Foundation , Florence , Italy . <p> Table : General characteristics of included patients PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> <p> DIAGRAM : Figure 1 : Trial profile <p> GRAPH : Figure 2 : Cumulative probability of remaining free of bleeding from varices ( upper panel ) and of varices or portal hypertensive gastrophy ( lower panel ) Probability according to log-rank test . <p> GRAPH : Figure 3 : Cumulative probability of survival ( upper panel ) and of not dying from liver-related causes ( lower panel ) Probability according to log-rank test . <p>   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
