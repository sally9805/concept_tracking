Chapter One&lt; St. James Keep , Bavia , 1895 " What the deuce is she doing up there ? " Rafael St. James , prince of Bavia , demanded , bending as far out his chamber window as he could without plunging headfirst into the empty moat . A light and drizzling rain was falling , that gloomy evening in late May , but he could see all too clearly . Annie Trevarren , a lithe , barefooted figure clad in a pair of kidskin breeches and a flowing shirt that might have been pinched from his own wardrobe , was embracing the face of a gargoyle on the crumbling parapet of the south tower . Rafael felt an inward wrench at the sight of her , a tug born of something other than fear for her safety . Beside him , his eighteen-year-old sister , Phaedra , fidgeted and wrung her hands . " Annie wanted a clear view of the lake , " she said , as if that were reason enough to risk life and limb . " You must n't be angry , Rafael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runs in the Trevarren family , you know .... He cursed Miss Annie Trevarren and her alleged " adventurous nature " as he whirled away from the window and sprinted across the room toward the yawning doors , which stood a little ajar because of Phaedra 's abrupt entrance . The princess scurried along behind him , moving as rapidly as her cumbersome skirts would allow and prattling the whole way . Rafael ran down the hall toward the enclosed staircase in the southern-most corner of the keep . " Annie occasionally does impulsive things  --  but she invariably regrets them later and makes up for her errors quite nicely , and she is extremely practical in most instances ... " Rafael ignored his sister 's breathless blatherings in defense of her friend and schoolmate and ran as fast as he could , directing his thoughts to Annie . Hold on , you little fool . Just hold on ! His bodyguard and childhood friend , Edmund Barrett , reached the stairs at the same moment as Rafael . It was plain from the consternation in the other man 's normally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trevarren 's predicament or had seen it for himself . " Let me handle this , Your Highness  --  " he began . Barrett tended to address Rafael formally in any emergency . Rafael shook his head and pushed past Barrett to mount the spiral steps . He was still the master of St. James Keep , however tenuous his hold on the rest of the country might be , and thus responsible for the safety of those within its ancient walls . Not to mention , the young woman 's parents , Patrick and Charlotte Trevarren , were among his most valued friends . What would he say to them if Annie fell to her death  --  that they still had four daughters left and should n't trouble themselves over the loss of the eldest ? The little minx was a guest in his house  --  had been for a week  --  and it was his responsibility to look after her . The door at the top of the staircase was open , of course , and Rafael stepped cautiously over the threshold . Annie stood several yards away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , embracing the gargoyle with both arms . Her red-gold hair tumbled down her back and curled in the moist air . " Do n't worry , Annie ! " Phaedra called , from just behind the prince 's right shoulder . " Rafael will save you ! " " Be quiet and stay back , " Rafael hissed , assessing the state of the parapet itself . The rain , smelling of settled dust , cooled his skin . To Annie he said , " Do n't move . " Apparently , St. Aspasia 's Academy for Young Women of Quality , where both Annie and Phaedra had spent the past few years learning manners and deportment , had served at least some part of its purpose . Even in that dire situation  --  and it was dire , for the girl was standing on loose pebbles and very little else  --  she smiled bravely and nodded , though she was pale and trembling . " I wo n't , " she promised , in a stoic tone . Rafael indulged a perverse desire to look down . The brick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dusk and a number of spectators had congregated , their torches making spots of fire . He closed his eyes for a moment and offered a silent prayer to a God who had long since abandoned him , then eased out onto the ledge . Some of the stone fell away beneath his feet , and he leaned back against the moss-slickened wall , arms spread wide , breathing deeply . Should the Trevarren chit be fortunate enough to survive this folly , he reflected , he might well murder her himself . " Do be careful , " Annie counseled , as though he were the one who needed rescuing . Rafael felt color surge up his neck and pulse along his jawline as he moved closer to her , ever so slowly , progressing by inches , and fractions of inches . " I was n't planning to hang by my feet or do handstands , Miss Trevarren , " he replied reasonably . This was no time , or place , after all , to lose his temper . If they were both lucky , he would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he vowed to himself , he 'd deliver a lecture this little hellion would never forget . After that , he might just throw her into the dungeon or hang her up by her thumbs . He reached Annie 's side on the strength of these fantasies and slipped one arm around her waist . " All right , Miss Trevarren , " he said quietly , with a calmness he did n't feel . " Release your hold on the masonry , if you will , and we 'll start back . It 's going to be a slow process , though  --  no sudden moves , or we 'll both be splattered on the stones of the courtyard . Understood ? " Remarkably , he felt her bristle , ever so slightly , against his rib cage . " Believe me , Your Highness , " she said with stiff dignity , " your instructions were quite clear . " Rafael risked a step , holding his breath , rejoicing inwardly when the parapet held . He muttered something meaningless , even to himself , and they progressed another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall , then tumbled soundlessly through space . The mist had turned to hard rain , soaking Annie 's clothes and hair , extinguishing the torches below , and making the stones of the narrow walkway slippery as well as unstable . Rafael stole a sidelong glance at Annie and saw that she was holding back tears , and that knowledge stung him out of all proportion to good sense . Miss Trevarren might have been foolhardy , but he secretly admired her boldness and courage . " You 'll be all right , " Rafael said , in a gentler tone than he 'd used before . Annie snuffled . Like him , she pressed her back to the wall of the tower , one arm out wide for balance . They were a few inches nearer the door . " I was just thinking of my new yellow dress , " she told him seriously . " It will be a shame if I never get to wear it . One must take joy in small things , you know . " For one rash moment , Rafael considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter . " That would be among my lesser concerns , " he said tautly . Out of the comer of his eye , he saw that Barrett was in the doorway , holding a coiled rope . " Only because you probably do n't own a yellow dress , " Annie replied , in a tone that somehow made the nonsensical sound rational . Rafael felt a muscle twitch in his right cheek . The rope snaked out toward him , and he caught the end in his free hand , nearly losing his balance in the endeavor . " Yellow has never been my color , " he answered dryly , and at great length . " Here . We 'll tie this around your waist . If you fall while stepping across that chasm in the parapet , and you well might , do n't panic and start screaming and flailing about . Barrett is more than capable of holding on and hauling you to safety . " Annie 's eyes widened in her pale face , and for the first time , Rafael noticed that they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What about you ? " He permitted himself a heartfelt sigh . Perhaps it would n't be such a bad thing if he fell ; it would save the rebels the trouble of capturing , trying and finally hanging him , not to mention sparing the people of Bavia a long and costly civil war . Tightening the rope around her middle and testing the knot as best he could , Rafael replied , " Indeed , Miss Trevarren  --  what about me ? " " Ready ? " Barrett called , through the thickening twilight . " Yes , " Rafael replied , looking down into Annie 's upturned , rain-beaded face . In the next instant , before he could think about it too much , he maneuvered her around him . She shrieked as a chunk of the parapet gave way and she fell , kicking wildly and clinging to the rope with both hands as she swayed , like a human pendulum , high above the main courtyard . Rafael 's breath burned in his throat and scalded his chest as he watched her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walkway all but dissolving under the soles of his boots . Horrific images flooded his mind  --  he saw the rope breaking , saw the Trevarren girl plummeting through space , heard her strike the stones below with such vivid clarity that bile surged into the back of his throat . After that , the pictures became more confused ; in an instant , he was back in the palace in Morovia , standing in the receiving line again , with his beloved Georgiana at his side , reliving the events of that night eighteen months before . His father , the last prince of Bavia , had been dead only a few weeks , and Rafael had just returned to the country after some twelve years of exile in England . The scene unfolded quickly in his mind . The stranger approached Rafael , the new and untested ruler and , before anyone could stop him , drew a small pistol from the pocket of his evening coat and aimed it at the prince 's chest . Georgiana had apparently seen what was happening , for she stepped between them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant for her husband . Rafael heard the shot echoing in his head and closed his eyes , too dizzy to move , but after a few seconds , he collected himself and looked toward the tower window just in time to see Barrett dragging Annie inside . Relief swept through Rafael with such force that his knees went weak and again he pondered the attributes of death . If there was an afterlife , he might see Georgiana again , and Barrett 's father . More of the parapet crumbled away into space , and he pressed his back hard against the wall , fingers clutching the time-beaten , porous stones . " She 's safe inside now , sir , " Barrett said , raising his voice to be heard over the rising wind and the slashing patter of the rain . " Heads up , then . Here comes the rope . " It undulated toward him , that length of woven hemp , and Rafael caught it in both hands and held on with a ferocity that belied his earlier reflections on the advantages of dying . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rope around his chest , and he felt its roughness bum into his hands as he slid , the knot giving way , almost to its end . He slammed hard against the wall of the castle , blinded now by the downpour , focusing all his energy , all the strength of his being , on the simple process of holding on . Barrett pulled him upward , one lurching wrench at a time , while Rafael dangled , his palms raw where he grasped the slick rope . At last , he felt hands , half a dozen of them , gripping him under the arms , by the wrists , by the back of his coat . They hauled him inside , Barrett , one of his lieutenants , and Lucian , Rafael 's young half brother . He crouched on the landing for several moments , soaked and bruised , his hands bleeding , his heart hammering against his breastbone , his breath grating like coarse sand in his lungs . Barrett dragged him unceremoniously to his feet . " Are you all right ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them was old , and it was deep . Rafael managed a bitter , choked laugh , swayed slightly . When he spoke , it was in a furious rasp . " Where is she ? " Annie had been waiting on the top step of the tower staircase , shivering with cold and residual terror , offering fervent , if silent , prayers that Rafael would be saved . Had she loved him , devotedly if from a distance , all these years , she 'd asked herself , only to be the cause of his death ? At the sound of his voice , a low rumbling like summer thunder , however , both she and Phaedra stiffened in alarm . The princess clutched Annie 's hand and pulled . " Quickly ! " Phaedra hissed , dragging her friend down the smooth steps toward the hallway . " If Rafael catches up to us now , there 's no guessing what he 'll do ! " Annie considered a couple of the possibilities and suddenly all the strength came back into her legs . Unencumbered by skirts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passage , having no earthly idea where to hide . Such was her unbridled agitation , alas , that she tripped on the comer of a rug and went sprawling onto the floor . Before she could rise again , a pair of hard male hands hoisted her to her feet . She looked into the coldly furious face of the prince himself . " Rafael  --  " Phaedra pleaded , grasping her brother 's arm . He pulled free of his sister 's hold , his storm gray eyes locked on Annie 's face . He spoke to the soldier without looking away . " Take Miss Trevarren to her room and bolt the door . I 'll deal with her in the morning . At the moment , I do not trust myself with the task . " Annie was cold and wet and full of remorse for giving in to the more daring side of her nature , but she felt a flush of indignation at his words and took umbrage at the tone in which they were delivered . " Why do n't you just chain me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she asked , with dignity . " A delightful suggestion , " Rafael bit out , still glaring at her . " And do n't think I have n't considered it . Have you any others , Miss Trevarren ? More drastic ones , I hope ? " She wilted slightly , for bravado will carry one just so far . Then , swallowing , she returned Rafael 's icy stare , wondering what she 'd ever seen in him and knowing , at the same time , exactly what . He was strong , he was handsome , he was good , and she could n't so much as think about him without feeling a tug in her heart and a less prosaic response somewhere else . " No , " she conceded . " I have n't . " Only then did the prince unwrap his fingers from around Annie 's arm . Mr. Barrett proceeded down the hall , with Lucian following at a reluctant pace and casting backward glances over one shoulder , but Rafael remained , towering there in that chilly passage like some dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lingered stubbornly . " Do not delude yourself into thinking that I will forget this incident , Miss Trevarren , " Rafael said , bending until his aristocratic nose was almost touching Annie 's impertinent , faintly freckled and upturned one . " We shall , as I said , take the matter up again in the morning . " The prince had plainly meant to intimidate Annie , and he 'd succeeded , but she was too proud to let him see her trepidation . She squared her shoulders , lifted her chin , and refused to lower her eyes . Annie had learned long since , that one must , in the words of the Bard , assume a virtue if one has it not . Rafael shook his dark head , murmured something blessedly incomprehensible and walked on with a brisk stride . Phaedra immediately linked her arm with Annie 's and demanded in a whisper , " Are you mad ? " Annie did n't know whether her friend was referring to the ill-advised episode on the parapet of the tower or the more recent exchange with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prince was n't there to see , her shoulders sagged and her eyes brimmed with remorseful tears . What had she been thinking , to risk so much for a mere view of the landscape ? The two girls were headed toward their adjoining bedchambers , which were in the west end of the keep , before she replied . " I do n't know what gets into me sometimes , " she despaired . " I just get ideas  --  these incredible urges to climb things . The inspiration seemed harmless at the time , I assure you , and the lake was unbearably beautiful , blue as lapis , even with the rain coming on . " Annie paused to emit a violent sneeze , and Phaedra muttered something and stepped up her pace , forcing Annie to hurry , too . " Trees , drainpipes , trellises , the rigging of my father 's ship  --  " the errant houseguest went on , " I 've scaled them all . There are times when I simply must see the world from a new perspective . " Annie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a look at her surroundings from the crow 's nest of the Enchantress , and she 'd gotten the one and only spanking of her life after her father brought her down from that lofty perch . Her mother , Charlotte , usually her most ardent supporter , had offered no protest whatsoever , which meant it must have been a very foolish thing to do in the first place . For reasons of pride , Annie did not recount the experience to Phaedra . The princess , a hoyden of some repute in her own right , was shaking her head in an irritatingly superior way . " What will become of you , Annie Trevarren ? " she fussed , with a lofty sniff . " Just look at you  --  dressed like a boy , climbing out of windows like a monkey ! How do you expect to find a man and get married when you behave like a barbarian ? " To Annie 's vast relief , they had gained the doorway of her room . She longed for dry clothes , a fire to warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessarily in that order . Her desire to avoid a lecture she 'd heard a hundred times before from the nuns at St. Aspasia 's , among others , was even greater . She put her hands on her hips and stared back at Phaedra , who now wore a familiar expression of baffled concern . " There are other things in life besides finding a man and getting married , you know , " Annie said , though , at the moment , she could n't have named those things with any real exactitude . There were n't many other things to do , after all , if one 's sex was female , and besides , she 'd thought of little else from the time she 'd first laid eyes on Rafael . He 'd visited her parents ' home on the coast of France when Annie was just twelve , and changed the whole course of her life . " Like what ? " Phaedra challenged . She and Annie had come to Bavia , barely a week before , after leaving school in Switzerland , to plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celebration was to be a fairy-tale affair , suitable for a princess . Naturally , given her current occupation with matrimonial matters , Phaedra was an outspoken proponent of wedded bliss . Which did n't keep Annie from thinking , on occasion , that her dearest friend was whistling at shadows . Annie sneezed again , with spirit , just in time to evade the question . " I 'm freezing , " she said , then fled into her bedchamber and closed the door behind her . Fortunately , the fire was still burning on the hearth , and she hurried toward it . Once she was certain Phaedra would n't follow , determined to make her point , Annie tore off her wet clothes and undergarments . Her legs and arms were badly scraped and bruised where she 'd bounced off the castle walls during the rescue , but remembering that Rafael 's hands had been bleeding , she could n't summon up a lot of self-pity . Trembling with cold , Annie fetched a towel from the wash stand and dried goose-pimpled flesh , then pulled a nightgown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in fact , when a soft rap sounded at the door . Expecting a maid bearing brandy , which would have been most welcome , or a repentant Phaedra , which alas would not , Annie called out , " Come in ! " without a moment 's hesitation . Her heart stopped , missing several beats  --  she was to swear to it , forever after  --  when Rafael stepped over the threshold . His clothes , the same ones he 'd worn to bring her in off the parapet , were sodden , his dark hair was beaded with rain and showed evidence that he 'd raked his fingers through it a number of times in the few minutes since they 'd parted . The undersides of his hands were streaked crimson with dried blood , the backs already swelling visibly . The firelight cast a sinister , flickering glow over his countenance and , to Annie 's fanciful eyes , at least , Rafael St. James looked more like the devil than the reigning prince of a small , doomed country . She felt his gaze sweep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a peculiar , achy heat in its wake , and realized that the glow of the fire was probably shining through her nightgown and thus outlining the shape of her body . She stepped away from the hearth , taking refuge behind a high-backed chair . The silence lengthened . Finally , Annie could bear the thunderous tension no longer . " If you 've truly come to carry me off to the dungeon , " she said , in a small and shaky voice , " as you threatened before  --  I warn you , I shall resist . " St. James stared at her for a long moment , as if confounded , and then , suddenly , he laughed . The sound was purely masculine , deep and rich and intoxicating , and it spawned feelings in Annie that were at once delicious and terrifying . She looked around for some better shelter than that velvet-upholstered chair and , finding none , stood her ground . " I think you should leave , " she said , with polite belligerence . Rafael 's amusement had distilled from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rather demonic smile . He arched one dark eyebrow and studied her at his leisure before responding . " No doubt you 're right , " he conceded . " I should leave . However , I am the master of St. James Keep , as well as the ruler of this godforsaken country . As such , I go where I please . " Annie swallowed hard to keep herself from pointing out that he was about to be overthrown . It would have been cruel and disrespectful and , anyway , she owed Rafael St. James some degree of civility for saving her life . She felt churning despair , as well as fear , just looking at Rafael , for she had loved him so deeply , and for so long , that it was a part of her nature . If he was taken by the rebels and executed , she too would die . Of a broken heart . " Thank you , " she said . " For saving me , I mean . " The prince looked down at his hands , seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been rubbed raw by the rope , and that they were blood-smeared . When he met her eyes again , his expression was at once weary and wry . Rafael inclined his head in a courtly way . " You 're quite welcome , Miss Trevarren , " he allowed . " However , if you ever do such a stupid thing again , while living under my roof at least , I swear by every stone and timber in this keep that I 'll personally carry you aboard the first ship that drops anchor off the coast , to be used as fish bait . " Annie blushed . This was n't exactly the kind of vow she 'd dreamed of hearing from Rafael these past six years . " My father would be very angry . I have no doubt , in fact , that he 'd horsewhip you for such an offense . " " I 'm willing to take that risk , Miss Trevarren . " His gaze was steady , unrelenting . He drew a deep breath and forced it out in a noisy sigh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't need a doctor ? " " No , " she said , feeling fathomless guilt for the pain she 'd caused Rafael that night , and the danger she 'd put him in . Especially now that she realized he 'd come to her chamber to make sure she was n't injured . " But I think you probably need a doctor . " " Yes , " he said wearily still looking at his hands . " I 'd better have these attended to . Good night , Miss Trevarren . " With that , he turned to leave . " Rafael ? " He stopped and waited , but did not look back at her . " I 'm sorry . " At last , Rafael turned . His gray eyes were snapping with renewed irritation . " Yes , " he said . " And you 'll be sorrier still tomorrow . " And then he was gone . Ten minutes after his encounter with Miss Trevarren , in the privacy of his study , Rafael winced and spat a curse as Barrett poured straight whiskey over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair next to the fire while his friend , bodyguard and most trusted advisor stood beside him . Because they 'd practically grown up together  --  Barrett 's father had been the gamekeeper on the Northumberland estate where Rafael had been fostered  --  the two were closer than most brothers . After the last prince of Bavia had been killed in a duel  --  William St. James had been a drunken tyrant , justly despised by his family as well as his people  --  Rafael had been brought home to take up the reins of government . Barrett , a highly trained and experienced soldier , had made the journey with him . " That 's what you get for rescuing damsels in distress , " Barrett remarked , with a half smile , as he dabbed at Rafael 's injuries with a clean towel . " But then , you 've always been too chivalrous for your own good . One of these days , it 's going to mean the end of you . " " What should I have done ? " Rafael snapped . " Left a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there on the parapet to meet her fate ? " " You could have let me bring Miss Trevarren in , " Barrett replied , unruffled . He was winding bandages around Rafael 's right hand by then . " That is n't your duty . " " My duty , " Barrett countered smoothly , " is to protect you . " " And you did , " Rafael said , " when you threw me the rope and hauled me back inside . Thank you for that , by the way . " Barrett smiled again and began wrapping Rafael 's other hand . " She 's a spirited little minx , your American Miss . " Rafael felt a flash of irritation , and it only compounded his annoyance to realize that he gave a damn what other men thought of Annie Trevarren , be it good or ill . Even this one , the most loyal of all his companions , would need to tread lightly . " It 's an inherited trait , " he said evenly . " You would have to know her parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the bandage neatly , then crossed the room to the liquor cabinet , where he poured brandy into two snifters . He offered the first to Rafael , who lifted it awkwardly to his lips and took a restorative sip . The bodyguard generally kept his thoughts and opinions to himself , which was the way Rafael preferred matters to be handled , but that night the Englishman seemed unusually talkative . " It 's dangerous here , " he remarked , raising his own glass to drink . He paused for a few moments after doing so , perhaps savoring the brandy , perhaps sorting his thoughts . Most likely , it was both , for he was an intelligent man , and he appreciated good liquor . " Frankly , I 'm surprised you would allow your sister to return to the country , given the current state of political affairs . " Rafael sighed again and closed his eyes . His hands throbbed and so did both his knees and his right shoulder ; appendages that had been slammed or abraded against the hallowed walls of St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Barrett 's rope like a wriggling trout on a line . He was in no mood to frame answers to questions he had yet to settle within his own mind . " No doubt you 're also wondering why I allowed Phaedra to bring a guest , as well , when times are so troubled . You 've become quite curious in your old age , Barrett . " The bodyguard smiled ; like Rafael , he was in his early thirties . Both men had lost their mothers at an early age . John Barrett , Edmund 's father , had been kind to the young exile , patiently teaching him to ride and fish and hunt and fight , just as if the boy were his own . Times without number , Rafael had wished that were true . " Some would call me meddlesome , " Barrett confessed , at some length . " Yes , " Rafael agreed . " Still , you 've risked your own life to save mine on several occasions , and that entitles you to pry a little . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For seven hundred years , the women of our family have offered their marriage vows in our own chapel , within the walls of this keep . " A memory of his own grand wedding , to his beloved English rose , Georgiana , held in London because of the antipathy between Rafael and his father , filled his mind with color and pain . He pushed the recollection aside , along with the unprofitable bitterness he held against his own forebears . " I could not deny that tradition to Phaedra , danger or no danger . As for Annie 's  --  Miss Trevarren 's  --  presence here , she 's come to assist the princess with the myriad and no doubt tedious details of a royal ceremony . Besides , the young lady springs from very audacious stock , as you saw for yourself , this very night . " Barrett chuckled and shook his head , but something vaguely troubling flickered in his light brown eyes . His gaze , usually so direct , skirted Rafael 's . " The bridegroom seems in no particular hurry to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his chair , nearly spilling the brandy onto his late mother 's priceless Persian rug . It was one of the few articles of value he had kept after returning to Bavia less than two years before , and in that time , he had given centuries worth of plundered artifacts , treasures and jewels over to the national coffers . Although the fact was not widely known , the St. James family now lived on private money , well-invested . Rafael never forgot , waking or sleeping , that his efforts had come too late , for him and , very likely , for Bavia . " What are you looking at ? " Barrett asked , in a rather testy fashion , when he realized that Rafael was studying him closely . " You just made a rather odd remark , it seems to me . What do you care whether the princess 's future husband arrives tomorrow or next month or a week after doomsday ? " Barrett 's neck turned a dull shade of crimson , a phenomenon Rafael had not witnessed since their shared youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains of his brandy , drowning the words before they could pass his lips . Rafael 's nape was taut with tension ; he wished he could lie down in a dark room somewhere and sleep until it was all over  --  Phaedra 's wedding , the coming revolution , the utter and final collapse of a family , however self-serving , that had ruled over that small European nation for seven centuries . Rafael yearned for peace and yet he knew full well that he would probably never live to see it . He settled back in his leather chair and closed his eyes for a moment . " You 've fallen in love with the princess , " he said . " When did it happen ? Last year , when she was home for summer holiday ? " Barrett was silent for a long time . When he spoke , his voice was gruff and a little defiant . " Yes . " " You know , of course , that it 's hopeless . Phaedra 's marriage to Chandler Haslett was arranged within days of her christening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened his eyes , met Barrett 's steady gaze , and made an effort to mask the sympathy he felt . " It is a matter of honor , this union . The bargain can not be undone . Not even for you , my friend . " " She does n't love him . " The certainty with which Barrett spoke worried Rafael . " That does n't matter , " Rafael replied . " Arranged marriages are seldom , if ever , founded on love . They have more to do with property and political alliance . " Barrett did not argue , for he knew the weight of such customs as well as anyone , and it was tacitly understood that the subject was closed . He nodded and crossed the room to the massive double doors . " I 'll post a guard outside your chamber tonight , as usual . " " Fine , " Rafael answered , rising from his chair and frowning at the bulky dressings on his hands . How the devil was he supposed to accomplish anything , bound up that way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . For all I know , she climbs towers and walks on parapets in her sleep . " The bodyguard smiled , though the expression in his eyes was still somber . " As you wish , " he said , and went out . Rafael immediately rose from his chair , pulled off his bandages and tossed them into the fire . He flexed his fingers , grimacing at the pain even as he courted , endured , and finally forced it into a dark corner of his mind . That done , he poured himself more brandy and turned his thoughts to the problem of Annie . The prince smiled . He could n't very well have her thrown into the dungeon  --  Patrick Trevarren would horsewhip him for that , and be justified in doing so . Still , he 'd promised that her foolishness would not go unpunished , and he intended to keep his word . He owed himself that much , at least , after such a harrowing night .               @ @ @ @ @ @
