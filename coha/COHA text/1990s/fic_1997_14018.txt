It is summer . A great brooding silence fills the stage . It is empty when the curtain rises . Bells can be heard tolling outside . MAID ( Entering . ) The sound of those bells hits me right between the eyes . PONCIA ( She enters , eating bread and sausage . ) They 've been mumbling away for over two hours . The church looks beautiful When they sang the first response for the dead , Magdalena fainted . MAID She 's the one left most alone . PONCIA She 's the only one her father loved . ( She eats . ) MAID If Bernarda sees you PONCIA Since she 's not eating today , she 'd like us all to die of starvation . The old tyrant ! Well , I 'll fool her . I came back to open a jar of sausages . MAID Poncia , can I have some for my little girl ? PONCIA Help yourself and take a fistful of beans while you 're at it . She wo n't notice the difference today . MARIA JOSEFA ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old lady locked in ? MAID Double locked . I put the bar down . She can pick a lock . MARIA JOSEFA ( Voice off . ) Bernarda ! PONCIA ( Yelling . ) She 's coming ! ( To the Maid . ) Make sure everything 's spotless . If Bernarda does n't see it shine , she 'll pull out the few hairs I 've got left in my head . MAID That woman ! PONCIA Tyrant over everyone around her . She is capable of sitting on your heart and watching you die for a whole year without taking that cold smile off her wicked face . " Scrub , scrub those floors ! " MAID My hands are bloody from all the scrubbing . PONCIA Oh she 's the cleanest , the most decent , she 's superior to us all . Her poor husband earned a good rest . ( The bells stop . ) MAID Are there enough chairs ? PONCIA Plenty . Let them sit on the floor . She does n't like people under her roof anyway . Nobody 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean . MAID With you , she behaves well . p. 4 PONCIA Thirty years washing her sheets ; thirty years eating her leftovers ; nights watching over her when she had a cough ; whole days peeking through a crack in the shutters to spy on the neighbors and tell her the tale ; life without secrets one from the other . Curse her . May the nails of the cross pierce both her eyes . MAID Poncia ! PONCIA But I 'm a good dog . I bark when I 'm told to , and I bite the beggars ' heels when she sics me on them . My boys may work in her fields  --  but the day will come when I 've had enough . MAID And then ? PONCIA And then I 'll lock myself in a room with her and spit in her face  --  for a whole year . " Here 's for this , Bernarda , and here 's for that , and here 's for the other " till I leave her like a lizard the boys have squashed . Because that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not that I envy her her life . Stuck with five girls , five ugly daughters  --  all of them poor  --  except the oldest , Angustias , by the first husband , she 's got some money ; but the rest oh plenty of embroidered lace and linen tablecloths , but bread and grapes is all they 'll inherit . MAID I 'd like to have what they 've got ! PONCIA ( At the table . ) This glass has some spots on it . p. 5 MAID Nothing will clean it off . ( The bells toll . ) PONCIA The last prayer for the dead , I 'm going over to listen . There is nobody like the old Sacristan , Tronchafinos . At my mother 's mass , God rest her soul , the walls shook , and when he sang the Amen , it was like a wolf had come into the church . ( Imitates . ) A-a-a-a-me-e-en ! !

PONCIA I 'd rather pulverize something else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The bells toll . ) MAID ( Imitating the bells . ) Dong , dong , dong . May God forgive you ! Dong , dong , dong . May you wait many years for me . ( At the door with a Little Girl , a Beggar Woman with her hand out murmurs " Blessed be God " ) The door to the street 's right behind you . Any scraps today are mine . ( Beggar Woman enters , shoves the child in to beg on her knees . ) Get out ! Out ! Who said you could come in here ? Tracking your filthy feet over my clean floor ! Get out ! Get out ! Out ! Out ! Out ! Get out ! ( The Beggar Woman and the Little Girl leave . The Maid goes on scrubbing . ) Linen tablecloths and cupboards while we eat off dirt floors with one plate and one spoon . I pray for the day when not one of us is left to speak of it .

To hell with you , Antonio Maria Benavides , lying there stiff in your wool suit and your tall boots : Take what 's coming to you ! You wo n't be lifting my skirts anymore behind the barn door ! ( Laughs . Doors open . Two by two , 200 women In Mann 's production there were twenty women . in mourning with large shawls and black skirts and fans begin to enter . ) Ay ! Antonio Maria Benavides , you will never see these walls , you will never break bread under this roof again ! I was the one who loved you most of all who served you ! ( Pulling her hair . ) Must I go on living after you 're gone ? Must I go on living ? ( 200 women stop . Enter Bernarda and her five daughters . Bernarda leans on her cane. ) p. 6 BERNARDA ( Screams to the Maid . ) Silence ! MAID ( Crying . ) Bernarda ! BERNARDA Less wailing and more work . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . You do n't belong here . ( The Maid exits , crying . ) The poor are like animals : They 're made of different stuff . PRUDENCIA ( Indirectly . ) The poor feel their sorrows too . BERNARDA But they forget them soon enough over a plate of beans . ( To all . ) Sit down . ( Magdalena cries . ) Magdalena , do n't cry . If you want to cry , go do it under your bed . Did you hear me ? ( Long pause . ) PRUDENCIA I have n't felt heat like this in years . ( Long pause . They all fan themselves . ) BERNARDA Is the lemonade ready ? PONCIA Yes , Bernarda . ( She gets a tray of little white jars . ) BERNARDA Give the men some . PONCIA They 're already drinking , in the yard . BERNARDA Let them out the way they came . I do n't want them tracking through here . ( Awkward pause. ) p. 7 PRUDENCIA ( To Angustias . ) Pepe el Romano was with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was there . BERNARDA His mother was there . She saw his mother . Neither she nor I saw Pepe . ( Women buzz . ) Women in church must not look at a man , unless it is the priest , and only then because he 's wearing a skirt . If you turn your head , it means you 're itching for the touch of corduroy . ( Women buzz again . ) PONCIA ( Between her teeth to the women . ) Twisted old vine itching for the heat of a man ! BERNARDA ( Beats with her cane on the floor once . ) Blessed be God ! ALL ( Crossing themselves . ) Bless Him and praise Him forever ! BERNARDA Rest in peace , with the souls of the departed watching over you ALL Rest in peace ! BERNARDA With the Archangel Michael and his sword of justice ALL Rest in peace ! BERNARDA With the key that opens and the hand that locks p. 8 ALL Rest in peace ! BERNARDA With the most blessed saints , and the little lights of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charity , and with all souls on land and on sea ALL Rest in peace ! BERNARDA Grant rest to your servant Antonio Maria Benavides , and crown him with your sacred glory . ALL Amen . BERNARDA ( She rises and chants . ) Requiem aeternam dona eis , Domine . ALL ( Standing and chanting in the Gregorian fashion . ) Et lux perpetua luceat eis . ( They cross themselves . They start filing out . ) PONCIA ( She enters , carrying a moneybag . ) From the men  --  money for the mass . BERNARDA Thank them , give them some brandy . ( A Young Woman hugs Magdalena . To Magdalena , who is starting to cry . ) Ssh ! ( She beats with her cane on the floor . All the women have gone out . To the women who have just left . ) Go on back to your caves and criticize everything you 've seen ! And I hope it 'll be many years before you pass through my door again ! p. 9 PONCIA You 've got nothing to complain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fill my house with the sweat from their underclothes and the poison of their tongues . AMELIA Mother , do n't talk like that ! BERNARDA What other way can I talk about this damned village , a village without a river , a village full of wells , so every time you drink the water you 're afraid it 's been poisoned . PONCIA Look what they did to the floor ! ( Poncia cleans the floor . ) BERNARDA Like a herd of goats had tracked through here . Give me a fan , child . ( She gives her a round fan with green and red flowers . ) ADELA Take this one . BERNARDA Is that the fan you give a widow ? ( Throwing the fan on the floor . ) Give me a black one and learn to respect your father 's memory . MARTIRIO Take mine . BERNARDA What about you ? MARTIRIO I 'm not hot . BERNARDA Well , look for another one , you 'll need it . For the eight years we 'll be in mourning , not even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's how it was in my father 's house and in my grandfather 's house . Pretend we bricked up all the doors and windows . In the meantime , you will start sewing your trousseaus . There are twenty bolts of linen in the chest from which to cut sheets and coverlets . Magdalena can embroider them . p. 10 MAGDALENA It makes no difference to me . ADELA ( Sour . ) If you do n't want to embroider ours , yours will look better . MAGDALENA Neither mine nor yours . I know I 'm never going to get married . I 'd rather carry sacks to the mill . Anything rather than sit in these dark rooms day after day . BERNARDA That 's what a woman does . MAGDALENA Damn women ! BERNARDA In this house you will do as I tell you . You ca n't run telling tales to your father now . Needle and thread for the woman , whip and mule for the man . That 's how it is for people born to certain obligations . ( Adela goes out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Let me out ! BERNARDA ( Calling . ) Let her out now ! ( The Maid enters . ) MAID I could barely hold her down . She may be eighty years old , but your mother 's as strong as an oak tree . BERNARDA It runs in the family . My grandmother was the same . MAID Several times during the wake , I had to put a sack in her mouth . She wanted to shout out to you to let her have some dishwater to drink and some dog meat . That 's what she says you feed her . p. 11 MARTIRIO She 's wicked . BERNARDA ( To Maid . ) Let her get some fresh air in the yard . MAID She took all her rings out of her trunk and her amethyst earrings , put them on , and told me she wants to get married . ( The daughters laugh . ) BERNARDA Stay with her . Be careful she does n't go near the well . MAID You do n't have to worry she 'll throw herself in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see from their window . ( The Maid leaves . ) MARTIRIO We 're going to change our clothes . BERNARDA ( Pause . ) All right . ( Adela enters . ) And Angustias ? ADELA ( Meaningfully . ) I saw her peering through the crack in the back door . The men have just left . BERNARDA What were you doing at the back door ? ADELA I went to see if the hens had laid . BERNARDA But the men had already left ? ADELA ( Meaningfully . ) A group of them were still standing around outside . p. 12 BERNARDA ( Furiously . ) Angustias ! Angustias ! ALBA ( Entering . ) Do you want something ? BERNARDA What , or rather at whom , were you looking ? ALBA Nobody . BERNARDA Do you think it 's decent for a woman of your class to throw herself at a man the day of her father 's funeral ? Answer me ! Who were you looking at ? ( Pause . ) ALBA I BERNARDA You ! ALBA Nobody . BERNARDA ( Goes forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ( She strikes her . ) PONCIA ( Running towards her . ) Bernarda ! ( She holds her . Angustias cries . ) BERNARDA Get out , all of you ! ( They all go out . ) PONCIA She did n't realize what she was doing . Of course , I was shocked to see her sneaking off to the back door , and later she stood at the window , listening to the men 's conversation . As usual , it was n't the kind of conversation one should listen to . p. 13 BERNARDA That is why they come to funerals . ( With curiosity . ) What were they talking about ? PONCIA About Paca la Roseta . Last night they tied her husband up in a stall , threw her over the back of a horse and carried her off to the highest part of the olive grove . BERNARDA So what did she do ? PONCIA She ? She was willing . They say she was showing her breasts , and Maximiliano played her like a guitar . It was terrible . BERNARDA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They came back almost at dawn . Paca La Roseta had her hair loose , a crown of flowers on her head . BERNARDA She 's the only bad woman we have in the village . PONCIA Because she 's not from here . And the men who were with her are the sons of outsiders too . The men from here are not capable of that . BERNARDA No , but they like to watch , talk about it , suck their fingers over it . PONCIA They were saying other things , too . BERNARDA ( Looking from side to side . ) Such as ? PONCIA I 'm embarrassed to say . p. 14 BERNARDA And Angustias heard them ? PONCIA Of course . BERNARDA That one takes after her aunts , all innocent and flirtatious , making big sheep 's eyes at the first nobody who pays her a compliment . Oh , what you have to put up with , the fight you have to wage to make them behave decently and not run wild . PONCIA It 's just that your girls are at an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give you any trouble . Angustias must be well over thirty by now . BERNARDA She 's thirty-nine to be precise . PONCIA Imagine . And she 's never had a sweetheart BERNARDA ( Furious . ) No , none of them have had a sweetheart , and they do n't miss them . They get along very well . PONCIA I did n't mean to offend you . BERNARDA There 's no one good enough to come near them for a hundred miles around . The men in this town are not of their class . Do you want me to turn them over to the first farmhand I see ? PONCIA You should have moved to another town . BERNARDA Oh , I see . To sell them . PONCIA No , Bernarda . A change Of course , in any other place they 'd be the poor ones . p. 15 BERNARDA Stop tormenting me ! PONCIA No one can talk to you . Do we or do we not confide in each other ? BERNARDA We do not . You serve me , I pay you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is here . He 's come to see about the will . BERNARDA Let 's go . ( To the Maid . ) You start sweeping out the yard . ( To Poncia . ) And you start putting the dead man 's clothes away in the big chest . PONCIA We could give some things away . BERNARDA Nothing ! Not even a button ! Not even the handkerchief we covered his face with ! ( She goes out slowly , learning on her cane . At the door she turns to look at her two servants . They go out . She leaves . Amelia and Martirio enter . ) AMELIA Did you take your medicine ? MARTIRIO For all the good it 'll do me . AMELIA But you took it . MARTIRIO I do things without believing in them . But like clockwork . AMELIA Since the new doctor came , you 're much livelier . p. 16 MARTIRIO I feel the same . AMELIA Did you notice ? Adelaida was n't at the funeral . MARTIRIO I know . Her fianc wo n't let her go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to be happy ; now she does n't even powder her face . AMELIA These days you do n't know if it 's better to have a fianc or not . MARTIRIO It does n't matter . AMELIA It 's the fault of that harpy who wo n't let us live . Adelaida is going to have a terrible time . MARTIRIO Do you know how afraid she is of Mother ? AMELIA What ? MARTIRIO Because Mother 's the only one who knows how her father got his land . AMELIA What do you mean ? MARTIRIO Adelaida 's father killed his first wife 's husband so he could marry her himself . AMELIA ( Whispers . ) My God ! MARTIRIO Then he left her and went off with another woman who had a daughter , and later he had an affair with the daughter ! AMELIA Adelaida 's mother ! p. 17 MARTIRIO And married her after the second wife died insane . AMELIA Why is n't a man like that put in jail ? MARTIRIO Because men help each other and cover up for each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AMELIA But none of this is Adelaida 's fault . MARTIRIO No , but history repeats itself , It 's better never to look at a man . I 've been afraid of them since I was a little girl . I used to watch them in the corral , yoking the bullocks , lifting the sacks of grain , with their loud voices and heavy boots and always I was afraid of getting older for fear that I would suddenly find myself in their arms . God made me weak and ugly and kept them away from me . AMELIA You ca n't say that . Enrique Humanes was after you and you liked him . MARTIRIO That 's only what people thought ! One time I stood in my nightgown at the window until daybreak , because he sent the field hand 's little girl to tell me he 'd be coming , and he did n't come . It was all talk . Then he married someone else , with more than me . AMELIA And ugly as the day is long . MARTIRIO What do men care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yokes of oxen , and a submissive bitch who 'll give them something to eat . p. 18 AMELIA Shh ! ( Magdalena enters . ) MAGDALENA What are you doing ? MARTIRIO Sitting here . AMELIA What about you ? MAGDALENA I 've been going through the rooms for the exercise and to look at the needlepoint pictures Grandmother made ; the little woolly dog , and the black man wrestling the lion  --  we liked them so much when we were children . That was a happier time . A wedding lasted ten days and vicious tongues were n't in style . Today , it 's more proper . Brides wear white veils just like in the cities and we drink wine from bottles , but we 're rotting away inside these walls because we 're afraid of what people might say . AMELIA Your shoelace is untied . MAGDALENA What of it ? AMELIA You 'll trip on it and fall . MAGDALENA Well , that 'll be one less . MARTIRIO Where 's Adela ? MAGDALENA She put on the green dress she made to wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shouting , " Chickens , chickens , look at me ! " I had to laugh . AMELIA If Mother had seen her ! p. 19 MAGDALENA Poor thing ! Because she 's the youngest , she still has dreams . I 'd give anything to see her happy . ( Pause . Angustias crosses the stage , carrying towels . ) ALBA What time is it ? MAGDALENA Well it must be twelve . ALBA That late ? AMELIA It 's about to strike . ( Angustias goes out . ) MAGDALENA ( Meaningfully . ) Do you know about it yet ? ( Pointing to Angustias , with intent . ) AMELIA No . MAGDALENA Come on . MARTIRIO I do n't know what you 're talking about MAGDALENA You both know better than I , always with your heads together like two little sheep , not letting anyone in on things . About Pepe el Romano ! MARTIRIO Ah ! MAGDALENA ( Mocking her . ) Ah ! The whole village is talking about it . Pepe el Romano is going to marry Angustias . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's going to send a declaration soon . p. 20 MARTIRIO I 'm glad . He 's a good man . AMELIA So am I. Angustias has good qualities . MAGDALENA Neither one of you is glad . MARTIRIO Magdalena ! Please ! MAGDALENA If he were coming because of her looks , for Angustias as a woman , I 'd be glad . But he 's coming for her money . Even though Angustias is our sister , we 're her family and we all know that she 's old and sick and has always been the least attractive one of us all . If she looked like a scarecrow when she was twenty ; what does she look like now she 's nearly forty ! MARTIRIO Do n't talk like that . Good fortune comes to the one who least expects it . AMELIA But Magdalena 's right ! Angustias has all her own father 's money ; she 's the only rich one in this house . And that 's why , now that our father 's dead and all his money 's going to be divided , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is twenty-five and the best looking man in this village . The natural thing would be for him to go after you , Amelia , or Adela who 's twenty , not the least likely person in the house , a woman who  --  just like her father  --  talks through her nose . MARTIRIO Maybe he likes it . p. 21 MAGDALENA I 've never been able to stomach your hypocrisy . MARTIRIO Oh , God ! ( Adela enters , in her green dress . ) MAGDALENA Did the chickens see your dress ? ADELA What do you want me to do ? AMELIA If mother sees you she 'll tear your hair out . ADELA I had such hopes for this dress . I was going to wear it when we went to eat melons by the waterwheel . There would n't have been another one like it . MARTIRIO It 's a lovely dress . ADELA And it looks good on me . It 's the best Magdalena 's ever cut . MAGDALENA And the chickens ? What did they say to you ? ADELA They presented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( They all laugh . ) MARTIRIO You could dye it black . MAGDALENA The best thing you can do is give it to Angustias for her wedding to Pepe el Romano . ADELA ( With hidden emotion . ) But Pepe el Romano AMELIA Have n't you heard ? p. 22 ADELA No . MAGDALENA Well , now you know . ADELA But that 's not possible MAGDALENA Money makes anything possible . ADELA Is that why she went out after the wake , why she was standing at the door ? ( Pause . ) And that man would be capable of MAGDALENA anything . ( Pause . ) MARTIRIO What are you thinking , Adela ? ADELA I 'm thinking this period of mourning has caught me at the worst possible moment . MAGDALENA You 'll get used to it . ADELA ( Bursting out , crying with rage . ) No , I will not get used to it . I ca n't stay locked up . I do n't want to shrivel up like you , I do n't want to lose the whiteness of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put on my green dress and go walking in the street . I want to go out ! ( The Maid enters . ) MAGDALENA ( With authority . ) Adela ! MAID Poor thing , she misses her father . ( The Maid exits. ) p. 23 MARTIRIO Quiet . AMELIA What happens to one of us happens to all of us . ( Adela calms herself . ) MAGDALENA The maid almost heard you . ( The Maid enters again . ) MAID Pepe el Romano is coming down the street . ( Amelia , Martirio and Magdalena run hurriedly . ) MAGDALENA Let 's go see him ! ( They leave rapidly . ) MAID ( To Adela . ) Not going ? ADELA It does n't make any difference to me . MAID He has to come around the corner , you can see best from the window in your room . ( The Servant goes out . Adela is left on the stage , standing doubtfully ; after a moment , she also leaves rapidly , going toward her room . Bernarda and La Poncia come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a lot of money for Angustias . BERNARDA Yes . PONCIA A whole lot less for the others . BERNARDA You 've said that to me three times , when you know I do not want it even mentioned . " Much less , a whole lot less . " Do n't remind me of it ever again . ( Angustias comes in , her face heavily made up . ) Angustias ! p. 24 ALBA Mother . BERNARDA You dare paint your face the day of your father 's funeral ! ALBA He was not my father . My father died a long time ago . Have you forgotten ? BERNARDA You owe more to this man , to your sisters ' father , than to your own . Thanks to him , your fortune is increased . ALBA We 'll have to see about that . BERNARDA Out of decency . To show respect ! ALBA Let me go out , Mother . BERNARDA Go out ? MARIA JOSEFA ( Offstage . ) Bernarda ! BERNARDA After you have taken all this powder off your face . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Offstage . ) Let me out , Bernarda ! BERNARDA Exactly like your aunts ! ( Bernarda violently removes the powder with her handkerchief . ) PONCIA Bernarda , do n't be such a tyrant ! BERNARDA My mother may be crazy but I still have my wits and I know exactly what I 'm doing . ( They all enter. ) p. 25 MAGDALENA What 's going on ? BERNARDA Nothing is " going on " . MAGDALENA ( To Angustias . ) Well if you 're arguing about the will  --  you 're the richest  --  you can keep it all . ALBA Keep your tongue where it belongs , in your purse . BERNARDA ( Beating on the floor . ) Do not think you can get the better of me . Until I am carried out of this house feet first , I will give the orders around here , for all of us ! ( Voices are heard and Maria Josefa , Bernarda 's mother , enters . She is very old and has decked out her head and breast with flowers . ) MARIA JOSEFA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will go to any of you . Not my rings , not my black moir dress . Because none of you will ever get married . Not one of you ! Bernarda , give me my pearl necklace . BERNARDA ( To the Maid . ) Why did you let her in here ? MAID She got away from me . MARIA JOSEFA Yes , I got away because I want to get married . I want to marry a real man from the shores of the sea , since all the men around here run away from women . p. 26 BERNARDA Silence , Mother . MARIA JOSEFA No , I wo n't be silent . I do n't want to look at these old maids burning to be married , turning their hearts to dust . I want to go home to my village , Bernarda . I want a man to get married to and be happy with . BERNARDA Lock her up ! MARIA JOSEFA Let me go out , Bernarda ! ( The Maid seizes Maria Josefa . ) BERNARDA Help her , all of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to get away from here , Bernarda ! Get married ! By the shores of the sea ! Down by the shores of the sea . Down by the shores of the sea . ( Quick curtain. ) @x Bernarda 's daughters are seated on low chairs , sewing . Magdalena is embroidering . La Poncia is with them . ALBA I cut the third sheet . MARTIRIO That one goes to Amelia . MAGDALENA Angustias , should I put Pepe 's initials on that one , too ? ALBA ( Dry . ) No . MAGDALENA ( Calling , offstage to Adela . ) Adela , are n't you coming ? AMELIA She 's probably stretched out on her bed . PONCIA There 's something wrong with that one . She 's restless shaky , she looks frightened  --  as if she had a lizard between her breasts . MARTIRIO There 's nothing more or less wrong with her than there is with the rest of us . MAGDALENA All except Angustias . ALBA I feel fine , and anyone who does n't like it can drop dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Your best features are your figure and your tact . ALBA Fortunately I will soon be out of this hell . p. 28 MAGDALENA Maybe you wo n't get out . MARTIRIO Stop it ! ALBA Anyway , better to have gold in your purse than beautiful eyes in your face . MAGDALENA This is going in one ear and out the other . AMELIA I wish there were a breath of air . MARTIRIO Last night , I could n't sleep because of the heat . AMELIA Me either . MAGDALENA I got up to cool off . There was a dark storm cloud and a few drops of rain fell . PONCIA At one o'clock in the morning , the heat was rising up out of the ground . I got up , too . Angustias was still with Pepe at the window . MAGDALENA So late ? What time did he go ? ALBA Magdalena , why ask if you saw him ? AMELIA He left about half past one . ALBA Oh yes ? And how would you know ? AMELIA I heard him cough and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I felt he left about four . ALBA It was n't him . p. 29 PONCIA I 'm sure it was . MARTIRIO It seemed that way to me too . MAGDALENA Well , that 's strange . ( Pause . ) PONCIA Angustias , come here , tell us , what did Pepe say to you the first time he came to your window ? ALBA Nothing . What should he have said ? Just conversation . MARTIRIO It 's very strange for two people who do n't know each other to suddenly meet at a window and get engaged . ALBA Well , I did n't find it strange . AMELIA I would have felt a little I do n't know . ALBA No , because , when a man comes to a window he already knows from all those people coming and going , going and coming , that she will say " Yes . " MARTIRIO But he had to say it to you . ALBA Well of course ! AMELIA ( With curiosity . ) And how did he say it ? ALBA Well , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you : I need a good woman , modest , and that 's you if you 're in agreement . " AMELIA Those things embarrass me. p. 30 ALBA Me too , but you have to go through with them . PONCIA Did he say anything else ? ALBA Yes , he was the one who did all the talking . MARTIRIO And you ? ALBA I could n't have . I felt as if my heart was coming out of my mouth . It was the first time I 'd ever been alone at night with a man . MAGDALENA And such a handsome one at that ! ALBA He 's not bad . PONCIA It 's easier for people who 've had a little experience , who 've been taught how to speak and know what to say . When my husband , Evaristo the Birdman , first came to my window Hahaha . MARTIRIO What happened ? PONCIA It was very dark . I saw him coming closer and when he arrived , he said to me : " Good evening . " " Good evening , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than half an hour . The sweat was running down my entire body . And then Evaristo came closer and closer as if he was trying to squeeze through the bars and said in a very low voice , " Come here , I want to feel you ! " ( They all laugh . Amelia gets up , runs and looks through the door . ) AMELIA Ay , I thought Mother was coming ! p. 31 MAGDALENA What she would have done to us ! ( They go on laughing . ) PONCIA And then after  --  he behaved himself . Instead of going to someone else , he started breeding canaries until he died . All of you are single , but you may as well know that fifteen days after the wedding , the man leaves the bed for the table and then the table for the tavern , and any woman who does n't accept this , rots away crying in the corner . AMELIA You did n't accept it . PONCIA I could handle him . MARTIRIO Is it true you hit him sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out one of his eyes . MAGDALENA That 's how women should be . PONCIA I 'm from the same school as your mother . One day , he said something or other to me  --  I ca n't remember what  --  and I killed all his canaries  --  with a hammer . ( They laugh . ) MAGDALENA Oh , Adela , you should n't miss this ! AMELIA Adela ! ( Pause . ) MAGDALENA I 'm going to go see . ( She goes out. ) p. 32 PONCIA That child is sick . MARTIRIO Of course she is , she hardly sleeps . PONCIA What does she do ? MARTIRIO How would I know what she does ? PONCIA You 'd know better than me , since you sleep with just a wall between you . ALBA Envy is eating her up . AMELIA Do n't exaggerate . ALBA I can see it in her eyes . She 's getting to look like a madwoman . MARTIRIO Do n't talk about madwomen here . This is the one place you should n't talk about that . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say she was asleep ? ADELA My whole body aches . MARTIRIO Did n't you sleep well last night ? ADELA Yes . MARTIRIO ( With intention . ) Well then ? ADELA ( With force . ) Leave me alone ! Asleep or awake it 's none of your business . It 's my body and I 'll do what I want with it . p. 33 MARTIRIO I was concerned about you . ADELA Concerned , or nosy . Were n't you all sewing ? Well , continue ! I wish I was invisible so I could pass through a room without people asking me where I 'm going all the time . MAID ( Entering . ) Bernarda 's calling for you . The man with the lace is here . ( All but Adela and La Poncia go out , and as Martirio leaves , she looks fixedly at Adela . ) ADELA Stop looking at me . If you want , I 'll give you my eyes , they 're brighter than yours and my straight back to replace your hump . Just turn the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's your sister and the one who loves you the most . ADELA She follows me everywhere . She sneaks in my room sometimes to see if I 'm sleeping . She wo n't let me breathe . And always : " What a shame about the face What a shame about the body it wo n't belong to anyone . " But that 's not going to happen . My body will belong to whoever I want . PONCIA ( With intention and in a low voice . ) To Pepe el Romano . Is that right ? ADELA ( Startled . ) What did you say ? p. 34 PONCIA You heard , Adela . ADELA You shut your mouth ! PONCIA ( In a loud voice . ) Do you think I have n't noticed ? ADELA Lower your voice . PONCIA Kill those thoughts . ADELA What do you know about it ? PONCIA We old women can see through walls . Where do you go when you get up at night ? ADELA I wish you were blind ! PONCIA When it 's about what this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of eyes . I want to know what you 're planning . Why did you stand half-naked at the window with the light on the second night Pepe came to talk to your sister ? ADELA That 's not true ! PONCIA Do n't be a child . Leave your sister in peace ! If you love Pepe el Romano , hold it in . ( Adela begins to cry . ) Besides , who says you ca n't marry him ? Your sister Angustias is sickly . She wo n't survive her first birth . She 's narrow in the hips , old , and in my experience I can tell you , she 'll die . And then Pepe will do what many widowers around here do , he 'll marry the youngest , and the prettiest , and that 's you . Feed that hope , or forget about him , whatever you want , but do n't go against the law of God ! p. 35 ADELA Shut your mouth ! PONCIA I will not shut my mouth . ADELA Mind your own business . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ADELA Instead of cleaning the house and going to bed to pray for your dead , you root around like an old sow drooling over other people 's affairs . PONCIA I keep watch so people wo n't spit when they pass our door . ADELA Why have you suddenly developed this great affection for my sister ? PONCIA I feel no affection for any of you . But I want to live in a decent house . I do n't want to be disgraced in my old age . ADELA Your advice is useless . It 's too late . I would n't just walk over you , you 're only a servant , I 'd walk over my mother to put out the fire that 's running through my legs and burning in my mouth . What could you say about me ? That I lock myself in my room and do n't open the door ? That I do n't sleep ? I 'm quicker than you . See if you can catch the rabbit with your bare hands . PONCIA Do n't defy me Adela , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , light the lamps , and make the bells ring . ADELA You can mount four thousand bright yellow flares on the walls of this house . No one can stop what has to happen . p. 36 PONCIA You want that man so much ? ADELA So much ! When I look into his eyes it 's like I am slowly drinking his blood . PONCIA I ca n't hear you . ADELA Oh , but you 'll have to . I used to be afraid of you . But I 'm stronger than you now . ( Angustias enters . ) ALBA Always arguing . PONCIA Of course . She wants me , in all this heat , to go and get her I do n't know what from the store . ALBA Did you get me that perfume ? PONCIA The most expensive one and the face powder . I put them on the table in your room . ( Angustias goes out . ) ADELA And keep it shut ! PONCIA We 'll see . ( Magdalena , Martirio and Amelia enter . ) MAGDALENA Did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wedding sheets are beautiful . ADELA ( To Martirio , who is carrying some lace . ) And these ? MARTIRIO Mine , for a nightgown. p. 37 ADELA Well , it takes a sense of humor . MARTIRIO For me to look at . I do n't have to flaunt myself in front of anyone . PONCIA Nobody sees you in a nightgown . MARTIRIO ( With intention , looking at Adela . ) Sometimes But I love underclothes . If I was rich I 'd have it all made from Dutch linen , all imported from Holland . It 's one of the few pleasures I 've got . PONCIA This lace would be nice for babies ' caps and christening gowns . I could n't afford it for mine . Maybe Angustias will use it for hers . When she starts having babies , you 'll be sewing morning and night . MAGDALENA I do n't plan to sew a stitch . AMELIA Much less take care of someone else 's children . Look at how our neighbors sacrifice themselves for those four little brats . PONCIA They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you can hear them fighting . MARTIRIO Go and work for them . PONCIA No . Fate has sent me to this convent . ( The bells are heard . ) MAGDALENA That 's the men going back to work . p. 38 PONCIA It 's three o'clock . MARTIRIO In this heat ! ADELA ( Sitting down . ) Ay . If only we could go to the fields too ! MAGDALENA ( Sitting down . ) Each class has its own work . MARTIRIO ( Sitting down . ) That 's how it is . AMELIA ( Sitting down . ) Ay ! PONCIA There 's nothing like being in the fields this time of year . The reapers arrived yesterday morning . Forty or fifty handsome young men . MAGDALENA Where are they from this year ? PONCIA From far , far away . From the mountains . Happy ! Like poplar trees ! Shouting and throwing stones ! Last night a woman arrived dressed in spangles and danced to an accordion . Fifteen of them paid her to go to the olive grove with them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the deal was a young man with green eyes , hard and tightly packed as a sheaf of wheat . AMELIA Really ? ADELA It 's possible . PONCIA A few years ago another of these women came to the village and I gave my oldest son the money myself so he could go with her . Men need these things . p. 39 ADELA They 're forgiven everything . AMELIA To be born a woman is the worst punishment . MAGDALENA Not even our eyes belong to us . ( A distant song is heard , coming nearer . ) PONCIA Here they come . ( Tambourines and carranacas are heard . Pause . They all listen in the silence cut by the sun . ) REAPERS Here come the reapersIn search of the grainReaping the heartsOf the women they claim . MARTIRIO They do n't care about the blazing sun ! ADELA I wish I was a reaper , to come and go as I please . Then I could forget what 's eating us alive . MARTIRIO What do you have to forget ? ADELA Everyone has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The song grows more distant . ) PONCIA Quiet ! Quiet ! REAPERS Open your doors and your windowsYou women that live in this townThe reaper asks for rosesTo decorate his crown . ( Martirio sings with it , nostalgically . Adela with passion finishes it . The song gets further away. ) p. 40 PONCIA They 're turning the corner . ADELA Let 's watch from the window in my room . PONCIA Be careful not to open the shutters too wide : They like to give them a push to see who 's looking . ( The three leave . Martirio is left sitting on the low chair with her head between her hands . ) AMELIA ( Drawing near her . ) What 's wrong with you ? MARTIRIO The heat is making me sick . AMELIA Is that all ? MARTIRIO I wish November would come , the rainy days , the frost , anything but this endless summer . AMELIA The summer will pass and it will come again . MARTIRIO Well of course . ( Pause . ) What time did you go to sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep like a log . Why ? MARTIRIO Nothing . But I thought I heard people in the corral . AMELIA Oh ? MARTIRIO Very late . AMELIA And you were n't scared ? MARTIRIO No . I 've heard it other nights . p. 41 AMELIA We should be careful . Could n't it have been the farmhands ? MARTIRIO The farmhands come at six . AMELIA Maybe a young , unbroken mule . MARTIRIO ( Between her teeth . ) Yes , that 's it , a young , unbroken , mule . AMELIA We should all keep watch . MARTIRIO No , no do n't say anything . Maybe I imagined it . AMELIA Maybe . ( Pause . Amelia starts to go . ) MARTIRIO Amelia ! AMELIA ( At the door . ) What ? ( Pause . ) MARTIRIO Nothing . ( Pause . ) AMELIA Why did you call me ? ( Pause . ) MARTIRIO It just came out . I was n't thinking . ( Pause . ) AMELIA Go and lie down for a while . ALBA ( Bursts in furiously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previous quiet scene . ) Where is the picture of Pepe I had under my pillow ? Which one of you took it ? p. 42 MARTIRIO No one . AMELIA It 's not like he 's Saint Bartholomew . ( Pancia , Magdalena and Adela enter . ) ALBA Where is the picture ? ADELA What picture ? ALBA The picture of Pepe , one of you has hidden it from me . MAGDALENA You have the audacity to say that ? ALBA It was in my room and it 's not there now ! MARTIRIO Could n't it have slipped out into the corral in the middle of the night ? Pepe likes to walk in the moonlight . ALBA Do n't play games with me ! When he comes I 'll tell him ! PONCIA ( Looking at Adela . ) No , do n't do that . It 'll turn up . ALBA I would like to know which one of you has it ? ADELA ( Looking at Martirio . ) Well somebody  --  everybody does , but not me . MARTIRIO ( With meaning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her cane . ) What is this commotion in my house ? In the silence of the heat of the day ? The neighbors will have their ears glued to the walls . p. 43 ALBA They 've taken the picture of my fianc . BERNARDA Who ? Who ? ALBA Them ! BERNARDA Which of you ? ( Silence . ) Answer me ! ( Silence . To Poncia . ) Search their rooms : Look in the beds . ( To Daughters . ) This comes from giving you too long a leash . But I 'll haunt your dreams . ( To Angustias . ) Are you sure ? ALBA Yes . BERNARDA You looked carefully ? ALBA Yes , mother . ( They all stand around in embarrassed silence . ) BERNARDA At the end of my life you force me to drink the most bitter poison a mother can bear . ( To Poncia . ) You did n't find it ? ( Poncia enters . ) PONCIA Here it is . BERNARDA Where was it ? PONCIA It was BERNARDA Do n't be afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) In between the sheets of Martirio 's bed . p. 44 BERNARDA ( To Martirio . ) Is this true ? MARTIRIO It 's true . ( Advancing on her , beating her with her cane . ) BERNARDA I 'd like to squash you like an insect under my foot ! You scorpion , you snake-in-the-grass ! MARTIRIO ( Furious , using the formal . ) Do n't you hit me , Mother ! BERNARDA I 'll hit you all I want ! MARTIRIO If I let you . You hear me ? Get away from me ! PONCIA Do n't be disrespectful to your mother . ALBA ( Holding Bernarda . ) Leave her alone . Please . BERNARDA Not even a tear . MARTIRIO I 'm not going to cry to please you ! BERNARDA Why did you take the picture ? MARTIRIO Ca n't I play a joke on my own sister ? Why else would I want it ? ADELA ( Leaping forward , full of jealousy . ) It was n't a joke , you never liked playing games . It was something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 45 MARTIRIO You be quiet , and do n't you make me speak , because if I do , the walls will fold in on each other for shame ! ADELA A wicked tongue never stops inventing lies . BERNARDA Adela ! MAGDALENA You 're both mad . AMELIA And you torture us with your shameful thoughts . MARTIRIO Some people do shameful things . ADELA Until they strip naked and the river sweeps them away . BERNARDA You are perverse ! ALBA It 's not my fault Pepe el Romano chose me . ADELA For your money . ALBA Mother ! MARTIRIO For your fields and your orchards . BERNARDA Silence ! MAGDALENA It 's the truth . BERNARDA Silence , I said ! I could see the storm brewing , but I did n't think it would break so soon . Oh , you 've laid a heavy stone of hatred on my heart . But I 'm not old yet , and I 'll chain up the five of you in this house my father built , so not even the weeds in the yard will know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ( They go out . Bernarda sits down desolately . La Poncia is standing close to the wall . Bernarda recovers herself , and beats on the floor . ) Use a firm hand Bernarda , remember , you have obligations . p. 46 PONCIA May I speak ? BERNARDA Speak . I 'm sorry you heard that . It 's never wise to have an outsider in a family . PONCIA What I 've seen , I 've seen . BERNARDA Angustias must get married right away . PONCIA Of course . We 'll have to get her away from here . BERNARDA Not her . Him ! PONCIA Of course . He 's the one to get away from here  --  good thinking . BERNARDA I do n't think . There are things one can not and should not think . I give orders . PONCIA Do you think he 'll want to go away ? BERNARDA ( Rising . ) What do you mean ? PONCIA He will of course be marrying Angustias . BERNARDA Speak up ! I know you well enough to know when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never knew a warning could be called murder . BERNARDA You have a warning for me ? PONCIA Bernarda , I 'm not making accusations , I 'm just saying open your eyes , and you 'll see . p. 47 BERNARDA See what ? PONCIA You 've always been smart . You can spot the worst in other people from a hundred miles away : Sometimes I think you can read their thoughts . But one 's children are one 's children . Now you 're being blind . BERNARDA Are you talking about Martirio PONCIA All right , Martirio . ( With curiosity . ) I wonder why she took that picture . BERNARDA ( Shielding her daughter . ) She says it was a joke . What else could it be ? PONCIA ( With energy . ) Do you really believe that ? BERNARDA Yes ! PONCIA All right , we are talking about your own . But what if we were talking about the neighbors from across the way ? BERNARDA Now you 're starting to sharpen the knife . PONCIA Bernarda , something very wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put the blame on you , but you 've never given your daughters any freedom . Martirio is sick for love , I do n't care what you say . Why did n't you let her marry Enrique Humanes ? Why , on the day he was to come to her window , why did you send him word not to come ? p. 48 BERNARDA And I 'd do it a thousand times over ! My blood will not mix with the blood of the Humanes as long as I live ! His father was a farmhand ! PONCIA Look what 's come of putting on airs . BERNARDA I put them on because I can afford to , and you can not , because you know what you come from . PONCIA ( With hatred . ) Do n't remind me . I 'm an old woman . I 've always been grateful for your protection . BERNARDA You do n't show it . PONCIA ( With hate masked by sweetness . ) Martirio will forget about this . BERNARDA And if she does n't forget , so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " very wrong " is going on here . That 's what you 'd like to believe . And if one day something should happen , you can be sure it wo n't get beyond these walls . PONCIA I would n't be too sure of that . There are other people in this village who can read thoughts at a distance . BERNARDA How you would love to see me and my daughters on our way to the whorehouse ! PONCIA No one knows their own end . BERNARDA I know mine ! And my daughters ! The whore-house was for a certain woman now dead . p. 49 PONCIA ( Furious . ) Bernarda , respect the memory of my mother . BERNARDA Then stop plaguing me with your wicked thoughts ! ( Pause . ) PONCIA Better if I stay out of everything . BERNARDA That 's right . Work . Keep your mouth shut . The duty of all who work for hire . PONCIA I ca n't do that . Do n't you think it would be better if Pepe were married to Martirio or yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think . PONCIA ( With meaning . ) Adela . Now there 's the true bride for el Romano . BERNARDA Things are never the way we 'd like them to be . PONCIA No , but it 's hard work turning them from their true course . For Pepe to be with Angustias seems wrong to me  --  and to other people as well . And even to the wind . Who can tell if things will turn out as they should ? BERNARDA Here you go again ! Sneaking up on me . My daughters respect me , and they have never gone against my will . PONCIA That 's right ! But the minute they break free , they 'll climb to the rooftops. p. 50 BERNARDA Then I 'll throw stones at them to bring them down . PONCIA You were always the bravest . BERNARDA I 've always enjoyed a good fight . PONCIA Is n't it strange ? You should see the fever Angustias is in over her lover . At her age ! And it seems he 's smitten , too . Yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by with the oxen at four-thirty in the morning , they were still there talking at the window . BERNARDA At four-thirty ? ALBA ( Entering . ) That 's a lie ! PONCIA That 's what he told me . BERNARDA ( To Angustias . ) Talk . ALBA For over a week Pepe has been leaving at one o'clock . May God strike me dead if I 'm lying . MARTIRIO ( Entering . ) I heard him leave at four too . BERNARDA Did you see him with your own eyes ? MARTIRIO I did n't want to be seen . Do n't you go to the side window to talk now ? ALBA We talk at my bedroom window . ( Adela appears at the door. ) p. 51 MARTIRIO Then BERNARDA What is going on in this house ? PONCIA Careful or you 'll find out . All I know is that Pepe was at one of your windows  --  at half past four in the morning . BERNARDA Are you sure ? PONCIA You ca n't be sure of anything in this life . ADELA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ruin us all . BERNARDA I know how to find out . If people in this town want to spread lies about me , they 'll find they 've run into a stone wall . No one is to talk about this ! or waves of filth could drown us all . MARTIRIO I do n't like to lie . PONCIA Then something is going to happen . BERNARDA Nothing is going to happen . I was born to keep my eyes open and I wo n't shut them now until the day I die . ALBA I have the right to know . BERNARDA You have the right to nothing except to do what I tell you . No one tells me what I can or can not do . ( To Poncia . ) You put your own house in order . Nothing happens here without my knowing about it . p. 52 MAID ( Entering . ) There 's a big crowd at the top of the street and all the neighbors are at their doors . BERNARDA ( To Poncia . ) You , run and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about to run out . ) Where do you think you 're going ? You women , staring at doorways , breaking your mourning . Go to your rooms , all of you ! ( They go out . Bernarda leaves . Distant shouts are heard . Martirio and Adela enter and listen , not daring to step further than the front door . ) MARTIRIO You 're lucky I did n't open my mouth . ADELA I could have said something , too . MARTIRIO What could you have said ? You wo n't go on like this much longer . ADELA I 'll have it all . MARTIRIO I 'll tear you out of his arms . ADELA Martirio , leave me alone . MARTIRIO None of us will have him ! ADELA He wants to live with me . MARTIRIO I saw how he was holding you . ADELA I did n't want this . It 's as if I 'm being dragged by a rope . p. 53 MARTIRIO I 'll see you dead first . ( Magdalena and Angustias look in . The tumult is increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PONCIA Bernarda ! BERNARDA What is going on ? PONCIA It 's Librada 's daughter , the unmarried one , had a baby , and nobody knows whose it is . ADELA A baby ? PONCIA And to hide her shame , she killed it and buried it under the rocks , but some dogs dug it up and left it at her door . Now they want to kill her . They 're dragging her through the streets . BERNARDA Good , let them come , let them bring olive switches and pick handles . Let them come and kill her . ADELA No ! No ! Not kill her ! MARTIRIO Yes  --  let us go out there too ! BERNARDA Any woman who tramples on her decency must pay for it . ( Outside a woman 's shriek and a great clamor is heard . ) ADELA Let her escape ! Do n't go out there ! MARTIRIO ( Looking at Adela . ) Let her pay what she owes ! p. 54 BERNARDA ( At the archway . ) Finish her off before the police get here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ADELA ( Holding her belly. ) @x It is night . The doorways , illuminated by the lights inside the rooms , give a glow to the stage . At Center there is a table with a shaded oil lamp around which Bernarda and her Daughters are eating . La Poncia serves them . Prudencia sits apart . When the curtain rises , there is a great silence interrupted only by the noise of plates and silverware . PRUDENCIA ( She rises . ) I 'm going , Bernarda . It 's been a long visit . BERNARDA Wait , Prudencia . We never see each other . PRUDENCIA Have they sounded the last bell for the rosary ? PONCIA Not yet . ( Prudencia sits down again . ) BERNARDA And your husband , how is he ? PRUDENCIA The same . BERNARDA We never see him either . PRUDENCIA You know how he is . Ever since he fought his brothers over the inheritance he wo n't use the front door . He puts up a ladder and climbs over the back wall . BERNARDA A real man ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 56 BERNARDA He 's right . PRUDENCIA I do n't know about that . BERNARDA A daughter who disobeys stops being a daughter and becomes an enemy . PRUDENCIA I let water run . ( A heavy blow is heard against the walls . ) What was that ? BERNARDA The stallion . He 's tied in his stall and he 's kicking against the wall . ( Shouting . ) Tether him and take him out in the yard ! ( In a lower voice . ) He must be too hot . PRUDENCIA Are you going to put him to the new mares ? BERNARDA At daylight . PRUDENCIA You 've known how to increase your stock . BERNARDA Through a lot of money and hard work . PONCIA ( Interrupting . ) She has the best herd in this part of the country . It 's too bad the prices are down . BERNARDA Do you want some cheese , or some honey ? PRUDENCIA I have no appetite . ( The blow is heard again . ) PONCIA Oh for God 's sake ! p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . BERNARDA ( Rising , furiously . ) Do I have to say everything twice ? Let him out to roll in the straw ! ( Pause . Then , as though speaking to the Stableman . ) Tether the mares in the corral , but let him run free , or he 'll kick the walls down . ( She returns to the table and sits again . ) Ay ! What a life ! PRUDENCIA You have to fight like a man . BERNARDA That 's it . ( Adela gets up from the table . ) Where are you going ? ADELA For a drink of water . BERNARDA ( Raising her voice . ) Bring a pitcher of fresh water . ( To Adela . ) You can sit down . ( Adela sits down . ) PRUDENCIA And Angustias , when will she be married ? BERNARDA They come to ask for her in three days . PRUDENCIA You must be happy . BERNARDA ( Pause . ) Angustias . ALBA Of course . AMELIA ( To Magdalena . ) You spilled the salt ! p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're already having . AMELIA It 's always a bad sign . BERNARDA That 's enough . PRUDENCIA ( To Angustias . ) Has he given you the ring yet ? ALBA See ? ( She holds it out . ) PRUDENCIA It 's beautiful . Three pearls . In my day , pearls meant tears . ALBA Well , things have changed . ADELA Things do n't change their meaning . Engagement rings should be diamonds . PRUDENCIA The most appropriate . BERNARDA With or without pearls , life is what you make it . MARTIRIO Or what God makes for you . PRUDENCIA I 've been told your furniture is beautiful . BERNARDA It ought to be . I spent 16,000 reales . PRUDENCIA What 's important is everything is for the best . ADELA And you never know . BERNARDA There 's no reason why it should n't be . ( Bells are heard very distantly. ) p. 59 PRUDENCIA The last bell . ( To Angustias . ) I 'll come back soon and you can show me the dress . ALBA Whenever you like . PRUDENCIA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Prudencia . ALL FIVE DAUGHTERS ( At the same time . ) God be with you . ( Pause . Prudencia goes out . ) BERNARDA Well , we 've eaten . That 's done . ( They rise . ) ADELA I 'm going to walk to the front gate and stretch my legs . ( Magdalena sits down in a low chair and leans against the wall . ) AMELIA I 'll go with you . MARTIRIO Me too . ADELA ( With contained hate . ) I wo n't get lost . AMELIA You should have company at night . ( They go out . Bernarda sits down . Angustias is clearing the table . ) BERNARDA I told you once already ! I want you to speak with your sister Martirio . What happened with the picture was a joke and you should forget about it . p. 60 ALBA You know she hates me . BERNARDA Each of us knows what we think inside . I do n't pry into people 's hearts , but I do insist you keep up appearances and we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BERNARDA Then that 's settled . MAGDALENA ( She is almost asleep . ) Anyway , you 're going to be leaving soon ( She falls asleep . ) ALBA Not soon enough for me . BERNARDA What time did you finish talking last night ? ALBA At half past twelve . BERNARDA What does Pepe talk about ? ALBA He 's distracted . He always talks to me as if he was thinking of something else . When I ask him what 's wrong , he says , " We men have our worries . " BERNARDA Then do n't ask him . Especially once you are married . Speak if he speaks , look at him when he looks at you . That way you 'll get along . ALBA Mother , I think he 's hiding a lot of things from me . BERNARDA Do n't try and find out what they are . Do n't ask him , and above all never let him see you cry . p. 61 ALBA I should be happy , and I 'm not . BERNARDA It 's all the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window bars , and he seems to fade away , like he 's being covered by a cloud of dust kicked up by the sheep . BERNARDA It 's because you 're not strong . ALBA I hope it 's that . BERNARDA Is he coming tonight ? ALBA No . He went to the city with his mother . BERNARDA Then we 'll get to bed early . Magdalena ? ALBA She 's asleep . ( Adela , Martirio and Amelia enter . ) AMELIA It 's such a dark night ! ADELA You ca n't see two steps in front of you . MARTIRIO A good night for thieves , or anybody who needs to hide . ADELA The stallion was in the middle of the corral . White ! Looking twice as big as usual ! He filled up the darkness . AMELIA It looked like a ghost . ADELA There are stars in the sky as big as fists . MARTIRIO ( About Adela . ) This one was staring at them until she almost broke her neck . p. 62 ADELA Do n't you like them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rooftops . I have enough to handle with what goes on down here . ADELA Well , that 's the way it is for you . BERNARDA It 's the same for you as it is for her . ALBA Good night . ADELA Are you going to bed now ? ALBA Yes . Pepe is n't coming tonight . ( Angustias exits . ) ADELA Mother , why do people cross themselves every time there 's a shooting star or a flash of lightning ? BERNARDA Oh , the old people know lots of things we 've forgotten . AMELIA I close my eyes so I wo n't see them . ADELA Not me . I like to see what 's been quiet for years and years suddenly shoot fire . MARTIRIO All that has nothing to do with us . BERNARDA Best not to think about them . ADELA Oh what a beautiful night ! I 'd like to stay up and feel the cool breeze from the fields . BERNARDA But we have to go to bed . Magdalena ! p. 63 AMELIA She 's asleep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bed ! MAGDALENA ( Rising , in a bad humor . ) You do n't give anyone a moment 's peace . ( She goes off grumbling . ) AMELIA Good night . ( She goes out . ) BERNARDA You two off to bed too . MARTIRIO Why is n't Angustias 's fianc coming tonight ? BERNARDA He went on a trip . MARTIRIO ( Looking at Adela . ) Ah ! ADELA Good night . ( She goes out . Martirio drinks some water and goes out slowly , looking at the door to the yard . La Poncia enters . ) PONCIA Are you still here ? BERNARDA I 'm enjoying the quiet and unable to see the " something very wrong " that is " going on " here , according to you . PONCIA Bernarda , let 's not go any further with this . BERNARDA In this house there 's one way of doing things . My watchfulness takes care of everything . p. 64 PONCIA Nothing is going on outwardly . That 's true . But your daughters live as if they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else can see into their hearts . BERNARDA My daughters ' hearts beat calmly enough . PONCIA That 's your business . You 're their mother . I have enough to do looking after your house . BERNARDA Yes . Now you 've turned quiet . PONCIA I keep my place  --  that 's all . BERNARDA Your problem is you have nothing to say . If there were weeds growing in this house , you 'd make sure all the sheep in the neighborhood came here to graze . PONCIA I hide more than you think . BERNARDA Do your sons still see Pepe here at four in the morning ? Do they still spread the same malicious gossip about this house ? PONCIA They say nothing . BERNARDA Because there 's nothing they can say . No meat to sink their teeth into , thanks to my vigilance . PONCIA Bernarda , I do n't want to talk about this because I 'm afraid of what you 'll do . But do n't be too sure . BERNARDA Oh , but I am . Very sure . p. 65 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly stop your heart . BERNARDA Nothing will happen here . I 'm on guard now against all your suspicions . PONCIA All the better for you . BERNARDA ( She rises . ) Exactly . ( The Maid enters . ) MAID I 've just finished the dishes . Is there anything else , Bernarda ? BERNARDA Nothing . I 'm going to get some rest . PONCIA What time do you want me to wake you ? BERNARDA Do n't . I intend to sleep soundly tonight . ( She goes out . ) PONCIA When you are powerless against the sea , it 's better to turn your back on it so you do n't see it . MAID She 's so proud , she puts a blindfold on herself . PONCIA Well , there 's nothing I can do . I tried to put a stop to this , but now  --  it frightens me too much . Feel the silence ? In every room , a storm is brewing , and the day it breaks it 'll sweep us all away . I said what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against her . She does n't know the power of a man among women alone . p. 66 PONCIA It 's not all Pepe el Romano 's fault . It 's true last year he chased after Adela and she was crazy about him , but Adela should have kept her place and not led him on . A man is a man . MAID Some say he 's talked to Adela many nights . PONCIA It 's true . ( Whispers . ) And that 's not all . MAID Bernarda 's rushing the wedding : Maybe nothing will happen . PONCIA No , things have gone too far already . Adela 's made up her mind , whatever happens , and the others constantly keep watch . MAID Martirio , too ? PONCIA That one 's the worst . She 's a pool of poison . She knows she ca n't get el Romano herself , and she 'd drown the whole world if it was in her power . MAID They 're bad ! PONCIA They 're women without men , that 's all . In matters like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( She listens . ) MAID What is it ? PONCIA The dogs are barking . MAID Someone must have passed by the front door . ( Adela enters wearing a white petticoat and a corselet. ) p. 67 PONCIA Did n't you go to bed ? ADELA I 'm getting a drink of water . ( She drinks from a glass on the table . ) PONCIA I thought you were asleep . ADELA I got thirsty . What about you , do n't you ever rest ? MAID Soon now . ( Adela goes out . ) PONCIA Let 's go . MAID We 've earned some sleep . Bernarda does n't let me rest the whole day . PONCIA Take the lamp . MAID The dogs are going mad . PONCIA They 're not going to let us sleep . ( They go out . The stage is left almost dark . Maria Josefa enters with a lamb in her arms . ) MARIA JOSEFA ( Singing . ) Little lamb , child of mineLet 's go to the shore of the seaThe little ant is at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leopard MagdalenaOf a hyenaLittle lambBaa ! Baa ! Baa ! We 'll go to the palms at Bethlehem 's gateYou and I wo n't want to sleepA door will open on its ownOn the beach you and Iwill hide in a hut of coral reef.BernardaFace of a leopardMagdalenaOf a hyenaLittle lamb , baaa , baaaWe 'll go to the palms at Bethlehem 's gate . ( Adela enters and runs to the corral door as Maria Josefa pounds on the front door . Martirio enters ) p. 68 MARTIRIO Grandmother , where are you going ? MARIA JOSEFA Have you come to open the door for me ? Who are you ? MARTIRIO How did you get out here ? MARIA JOSEFA I escaped . Which one are you ? MARTIRIO Go back to bed . MARIA JOSEFA Oh , now I see you . Martirio , face of a martyr . And when are you going to have a baby ? I 've had this one . MARTIRIO Where did you get that lamb ? MARIA JOSEFA I know it 's a lamb . But why ca n't a lamb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lamb than to have nothing . Bernarda , face of a leopard . Magdalena , of a hyena . MARTIRIO Do n't shout . MARIA JOSEFA It 's true . Everything is dark . Because my hair is white you think I ca n't have babies . Babies and babies and babies . This baby will have white hair , and will have another baby and all with white hair , like snow . We 'll be like the waves , one after another . And then we 'll sit down and we 'll all have white heads and we 'll be the foam of the sea . Why is n't there any foam here ? Nothing but mourning shawls . MARTIRIO Shh , Shh . MARIA JOSEFA When my neighbor had a baby , I took her some chocolate , and later , she brought me some  --  always and always and always . You 'll have white hair , but your neighbors wo n't come . I have to go now , but I 'm afraid the dogs may bite me . Will you come with me out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I like houses , but open houses with the women stretched out on their beds with their little children , and the men outside sitting on their chairs . Pepe el Romano is a giant ! Every one of you loves him . But he 'll devour you because you 're all just grains of wheat . No , not grains of wheat . Frogs without tongues . p. 69 MARTIRIO Go to bed . ( She pushes her . ) MARIA JOSEFA Yes . But later you 'll open the door for me . Wo n't you ? MARTIRIO Of course . MARIA JOSEFA ( Weeping . Sings her lullaby . ) Ah , little lamb , child of mineLet 's go to the shore of the seaThe little ant will be at his door I 'll give you my breast and bread . ( She goes . Martrio closes the door on Maria Josefa , locks it and goes to the yard door . There she hesitates , but goes two steps further . ) MARTIRIO ( Low voice . ) Adela . ( Pause . Louder . ) Adela @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ADELA Why are you looking for me ? MARTIRIO Stay away from that man ! ADELA Who are you to tell me ? MARTIRIO That 's no place for a decent woman . ADELA How you would love to take my place ! MARTIRIO ( Louder . ) This ca n't continue . p. 70 ADELA This is only the beginning . I have the strength to do it , and the spirit , and the looks , which you do n't have . I saw death under this roof and I went out to look for what is mine , for what belongs to me . MARTIRIO That man without a soul , came here for another woman . You put yourself between them . ADELA He came for the money , but his eyes were always on me . MARTIRIO I wo n't let you steal him . He will marry Angustias . ADELA You know he does n't love her . MARTIRIO I know that . ADELA You know because you 've seen  --  he loves me ! MARTIRIO ( Despairing . ) Yes ! ADELA ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He loves me ! MARTIRIO Stick me with a knife if you want , just do n't say that again ! ADELA That 's why you 're trying to stop me from going away with him . It makes no difference to you if he 's putting his arms around someone he does n't love : I do n't care either . He could spend a hundred years with Angustias , but if he 's holding me , caressing me , you ca n't stand it because you 're in love with him too . You love him ! p. 71 MARTIRIO Yes ! Let me say it without shame ! Yes ! My heart is bursting with envy . I love him ! ADELA ( Impulsively , hugging her . ) Martirio , Martirio , it 's not my fault . MARTIRIO Do n't touch me ! My blood is n't yours anymore . No matter how much I want to see you as a sister , I can only see you as another woman . ( She pushes her away . ) ADELA Then there 's no way out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Romano is mine . He will carry me away to the reeds by the sea . MARTIRIO He will not . ADELA I ca n't stand the horror of being under this roof anymore , not after tasting his mouth . I will be what he wants me to be . All the village against me , burning me with their pointing fingers , persecuted by those who call themselves decent people , and I will put on , in front of them all , the crown of thorns that belongs to the mistresses of married men . MARTIRIO Be quiet ! ADELA Yes , we 'll let him marry Angustias , it 's not important to me , but I 'll move to a little house by myself , where he 'll come and see me whenever he wants , whenever he desires me . MARTIRIO Not if there 's a drop of blood in my body . p. 72 ADELA You ca n't stop me . You 're weak . I could bring a wild stallion to its knees with the strength of my little finger . MARTIRIO Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't stand it . My heart is full of a force so vicious , I ca n't stop it from drowning me . ADELA They teach us to love our sisters . God must have abandoned me in this darkness , because I see you now as if I 'd never seen you anywhere before . ( A whistle is heard at the front door and Adela runs toward the door , but Martirio gets in front of her . ) MARTIRIO Where are you going ? ADELA Move away from that door ! MARTIRIO Get by me if you can ! ADELA Get away ! ( They struggle . ) MARTIRIO ( Shouts . ) Mother ! Mother ! ADELA Let me go ! ( Bernarda enters . She wears petticoats and a black shawl . ) BERNARDA Stop this ! Oh , how I wish I could make lightning strike . MARTIRIO ( Pointing to Adela . ) She was with him ! Look at her , she 's covered with straw ! p. 73 BERNARDA ( Going furiously toward Adela . ) The bed of a whore . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ( She snatches her mother 's cane and breaks it in two . ) That 's what I do with the warden 's rod . Do not take another step ! No one gives me orders here except Pepe ! MAGDALENA ( Entering . ) Adela ! ( Poncia and Angustias enter . ) ADELA I belong to him ! ( To Angustias . ) Accept it . He will be master of this house . Go out in the yard and tell him . He 's out there now , panting like a lion . ALBA My God ! BERNARDA The gun , where is the gun ! ( Bernarda rushes out . Martirio exits behind her . Amelia enters and looks on frightened , leaning her head against the wall . Adela tries to run out . ) ALBA ( Holding her . ) You 're not leaving here , to triumph with your body ! You thief ! You shame our house ! MAGDALENA Let her go where we never have to see her again ! ( A shot is heard . ) BERNARDA ( Entering . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 74 MARTIRIO ( Entering . ) That 's the end of it . ADELA Pe-pe ! My God ! Pepe ! ( She runs out . ) PONCIA Did you kill him ? MARTIRIO No . He galloped away on his horse . BERNARDA It was my fault . A woman ca n't aim . MAGDALENA Then why did you say ? MARTIRIO For her ! I 'd like to pour a river of blood over her . PONCIA Damn you ! MAGDALENA You devil ! BERNARDA It 's better this way . ( A thud is heard . ) Adela ? Adela ? PONCIA ( At the door . ) Open the door . BERNARDA Open the door ! Do n't think the walls will hide your shame . MAID ( Entering . ) All the neighbors are up ! BERNARDA ( In a low voice , but like a roar . ) Open the door , or I 'll break it down ! ( Pause . Everything is silent . She walks away from the door . ) Adela ! ( La Poncia throws herself against the door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she screams and backs out . ) What is it ? p. 75 PONCIA ( Puts her hands to her throat . ) May we never die like that ! ( The sisters fall back . The Maid crosses herself . Bernarda screams and goes forward. )
