Military music . A couple fox-trots across the floor . TECOYO You took me in your arms , said , COYTOE Fox-trot with me , baby . Slow . Slow . Quick-quick . TECOYO You counted , COYTOE One . Two . Three-four . TECOYO Our four feet moved from the burrow . COYTOE You were awkward at first . TECOYO It 's just that I 've had no one , and I felt the skate blade of my chest scrape yours . You counted , COYTOE One . Two . Three-four . TECOYO I thought you 'd be like snow in Oklahoma , gone not long after you fell . COYTOE But I held on . TECOYO You uncurled my fingers , opened my mouth with truth . You touched me like the jump of stones on a frozen river and I wondered where the anchor to your ship was . COYTOE I asked you to dance again and again . TECOYO You told me just how to follow . ( She fans coyly. ) p. 3 COYTOE Slow . Slow . Quick-quick . TECOYO I held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your voice . I looked for feathers under your arms , moved my feet with yours . COYTOE Who thought the fox-trot would be our dance ? TECOYO Who would have thought ANYTHING would pass between the crosswalk of our hearts ? COYTOE One . Two . Three-four . TECOYO But the dance floor thawed and other continents appeared . COYTOE A map of Australia tattooed on your underarm . TECOYO I told you I was a sheep sheared in winter . COYTOE You 're shivering . What 's wrong ? TECOYO I told you I had shearing cuts festering like strawberries . I want to burrow  --  COYTOE I took her in my arms . Licked her wounds . What else could I do with a part of myself ? And a piece of land white as the frozen ground at my window . TECOYO ( Eyes closed . Dreamily . ) Right . Two-three . Left . Two-three. p. 4 COYTOE Why were you alone ? A prEEty thing like you ? TECOYO I moved here by myself . For a long time , I sat alone in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a walnut . Then I came to the Bel-Rae Ballroom . COYTOE What do you do ? TECOYO Teach . COYTOE What do you teach ? TECOYO History . COYTOE Yipe-os . I do n't know anything about the past . Did you leave a lover behind when you moved ? TECOYO No . What do n't you know about the past ? COYTOE The first moment you pushed nose against mine . TECOYO I do n't know what happened then either , Coytoe . I forgot the sheep shivering in Australia , I guess . COYTOE I like your fan . TECOYO See the azaleas on it ? I 've always wanted a garden with geraniums and petunias . Trillium . Blue phlox . Zinnias . COYTOE Chee-O ! You really do like flowers . Come with me to the North Shore . There are wildflowers  --  p. 5 TECOYO ( She interrupts . ) I 've always had this cabin in my mind . This place  --  But I do n't know where it is . COYTOE We 'll go over July 4th . TECOYO I ca n't . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're both a part of one . TECOYO I have that feeling , too . But I ca n't . COYTOE ( Fingering her fan . ) Why not ? I 'd show you the wildflowers . TECOYO I 'll tell you when I know for sure . COYTOE ( Exploring further . ) What are these at your waist ? TECOYO Dried bear ovaries and a fetus . Just the idea of a child , really . I could n't decide whether to have one or not . COYTOE You 're about to run out of time , Tecoyo . TECOYO You 're speaking more truth than you know . I want a child . I 've always wanted one . I 've written a composition called , " My Child " : He runs through the field . He catches butterflies . He makes a chain of summer flowers . p. 6 COYTOE And the berries ? ( He looks at them. ) @x ( He combs his chest hair. ) @x ( Fanning ) I 'm going to have a hysterectomy .

Three-four . Slow . Slow . Quick-quick . TECOYO I 'm always awkward at first . COYTOE You 've got other things on your mind . TECOYO Summer school for one . COYTOE A hysterectomy for another . TECOYO The world to Columbus was Europe , Asia , Africa . North . South . East . The West was closed until three ships sailed toward it . Three directions in search of the fourth . COYTOE There 's always four directions . Up . Down . Back . Forth . TECOYO Then Columbus went forth . p. 10 COYTOE Like I 'm going after you ? ( His hand creeps across her breast . ) TECOYO ( She moves his hand . ) You get me lost now where I 'm at . Let me tell my story . I teach history , remember ? Columbus thought it was smaller than it was : the earth . COYTOE Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his question . One . Two . Three-four . TECOYO He thought it was smaller than it was : the earth . And Asia larger . Only a handspan across the water . West . By God , he 'd sail it . Coytoe 's hand tries to move across her breast again , but she pushes it away . It was his vision-quest in the wilderness of the waves . A roller-coaster ride . Up . Down . Tecoyo makes exaggerated movements with her arms as they dance . COYTOE The Pinta , Nia , Santa Mara fox-troting on the waves . TECOYO This 's MY story . COYTOE Three fleas on the sea . One . Two-three . You 're missing steps again . TECOYO How could three ships cross a rocky sea five hundred years ago ? p. 11 COYTOE How could covered wagons cross America ? How can ANYTHING happen , given the odds ? But  --  " Ah ! " Columbus said , " Land ho ! " TECOYO Not yet ! I teach this , remember ? The Atlantic is hardly under them and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Quick-quick . TECOYO Oh , I do n't want to dance . I want to talk about boats on an open sea . She continues her story while he dances on . How else could the continents come together ? ( She works an imaginary crank and does other corny gestures as she speaks . ) I teach pictorial history . In other words , I ACT OUT history . I make it travel  --  COYTOE All this and she can almost dance , too . TECOYO ( Overly dramatic . She speaks as a teacher sold on her own ability to present her information. ) @x ( Pause )  --  before the surgery , after we were getting along . COYTOE I 'll be with you . Do you think I 'd let you go through that alone ? TECOYO We just met . How can I expect you to do that for me ? COYTOE It did n't take long to know you were a part of me . You do n't have anyone else . TECOYO The rows of strawberries are telling their tales . The red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As I pick the strawberries their red portraits bleed . I 'm ready to go to the sky , and you said , COYTOE Fox-trot with me , baby . TECOYO I want to be with my family again . And they 're all dead . I want to see my father . I 've thought about him lately . See , out across the field , the people with their buckets . All of us are only here momentarily . For a morning . Standing in our summer dresses and trousers in the middle of the field . We 're all migrant workers . Filling our boxes with red fruit . Luscious strawberries . The little ovaries of them , red and diseased . COYTOE One . Two . Three-four. p. 14 TECOYO I want to go . I remember my father in the basement . Back in the early days when I was small and hunkering beside him on the basement floor as he skinned pheasant &amp; quail . Rabbit &amp; deer . I was a part of him then . I waited for him to get back from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We thanked them for their lives . I was part of the universe when I was with him . He was Adam with the old Indian language wedged in his teeth . COYTOE My father was a wedge in my teeth . TECOYO My mother 's dead too . Most of the family  --  except my brother . I do n't want to stay here without them  --  I could be myself when I was with them  --  with my husband , I felt I had to be what he wanted . I think it 's easier there  --  COYTOE You ca n't go like that . TECOYO Yes I can . COYTOE I told you I 'd be with you . TECOYO I 'm going over the edge of the earth . Who will go with me ? COYTOE Not I , said the coyote . I 'm staying here long as I can . TECOYO Then I 'll go myself . COYTOE You 're making too much of this . p. 15 TECOYO I belong to the Flat Earth Society . It 's a group for women . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saying we 'll fall off if we go too far . Maybe that 's where my cabin is  --  the place I 've always dreamed of . COYTOE It 'll be a piece of cake . Do n't worry , Tecoyo . I mean  --  Sweetie  --  I had a vasectomy . TECOYO You ca n't compare that to a hysterectomy . You wear your genitals on your elbow . Mine are INSIDE ! COYTOE A piece of cake . I was on the table watching  --  TECOYO You watched the doctor cut into your testicles ! COYTOE I asked if I could  --  TECOYO EOOOOOWW ! COYTOE He gave me a local anesthetic . He made two incisions in my balls with a little knife . He fished around for the two cords and pulled them out . Tecoyo is going through contortions . @x ( She looks at him . ) " I 'd been wondering where you were , " I said . COYTOE My one foot wanted to leave . But my other foot stayed . TECOYO We went up an elevator , and I must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to transfer me to my bed . They slid a board under me , and I was in bed in my hospital room . COYTOE A piece of jelly roll . TECOYO It was quiet again . I slept on &amp; off . I felt pain . The nurses came in for blood pressure &amp; temp . In the afternoon they tried to get me up . I felt sick to my stomach , but I had nothing to throw up . The nurse gave me a shot for nausea and another one for pain . My brother called from Oklahoma , but my voice was hoarse and I could n't say much . It was because of the tube that had been in my throat during surgery . The nurses came to change my IV and empty the urine bag . My temp went up to 101 the first night . The doctor said my lungs were congested . I tried to cough for them , but it hurt too much . They pushed a pillow against my stomach and said it would be easier to cough , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July 4th in my stomach . I got more shots for the pain and felt my body fall back into sleep . Then they took the catheter out and I struggled to urinate , but could n't . My hand swelled from the IV and I begged them to take it out . Finally , they did . p. 21 COYTOE Definitely a piece of crumb cake . TECOYO For two days they brought jello squares , shiny as polyurethane , and yellowed chicken broth , and I said even if I felt good it would make me sick . I wanted something to eat . I started passing gas . That 's all they asked me for two days . Had I passed gas ? I could n't eat until things were going through . If I got plugged up , I 'd know what discomfort was . Was I coughing every opportunity I could ? Was I breathing into the little machine they brought ? Did I want pneumonia ? My temp was high , and I shivered . I felt sick and wondered if I would live . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this sickness take me in its mouth and drag me to its cave . I could die after all . I had it in my power . What if my bladder never worked again ? ( Tecoyo puts her hand to her face . ) I felt my fingers wiggle and strange shadows passed in my head . I felt at times I was leaving . ( Coytoe puts his arm around her . ) Coytoe pulled me out of bed and walked me to the door of the room . The next day , I walked down the hall hanging onto him . I could n't even stand up straight . I thought he would talk about cake . I thought he would say , " Fox-trot with me , baby . " But he just walked beside me  --  Later in the night , I thought " Welcome to the New World . " ( Pause . ) I was catheterized four times . p. 22 COYTOE If I could 've been out of there  --  TECOYO That really means eight : in out in out in out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) The stiff little tube up the urethra into the bladder . The little balloon holding it in . The hook to the bag of urine in my hand as I walked . The last time I was catheterized , I could n't sleep . That night in the hospital , I saw a cross on the ceiling . There was a car in the drive before dawn . Its lights through the window made a cross . I watched it for awhile . Then the car moved from the driveway and the cross was gone . COYTOE My favorite part was the staples on her stomach like a jagged , silver zipper . TECOYO Do they hurt when they come out ? COYTOE Oh , no . Nothing hurts here . The ends are not bent like regular staples . They 'll come right out . TECOYO They pulled the catheter right out . " Take a deep breath , " they 'd say . Then I struggled to urinate and could n't . When my abdomen grew hard with urine they 'd come back with another package . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I watched them insert the stick into the tube . They put a plastic sheet under me and spread my legs . I held the bed rails with my hands and thought of escape . They separated my lips and cleaned with a wipe . They stuck the tube in SLOWLY all the way UP the steps to the sky . " Here comes the urine , " they said . They pulled the sheet out from under me with some red antiseptic smeared on it . They wadded up the cellophane wrapping and threw it all away . I stayed in bed with the tube poked against my spine , the urethra stinging like a wasp caught in it . " Visualize , " the nurse said . And I did . There was a time of drought in Israel , and Elijah saw a small cloud on the horizon , and he said , " Rain . " Every time a little splat hit , I said , " rain , " and finally one morning there was rain . A little at a time . But I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw on the ceiling that night . He had risen for me . But I had the feeling someone still had to die . p. 23 COYTOE Not me , said the coyote . TECOYO Drive slow , Coytoe . But keep heading away from here . When I sleep I dream I 'm being held down . I am the one who will be the sacrifice . Jesus , where are you ? Who are these thieves standing over me ? She thrashes with her arms . Coytoe tries to hold her . COYTOE Now do n't get hysterical . Is n't that why women have hysterectomies ? Count backwards . Four-three . Two . One . Quick-quick . Slow . Slow . TECOYO Four-three . Two . One . Look , how lovely  --  the uterus and fallopian tubes are something like a small , winged bird . Or a marsh fern with graceful , spiky stalks . The ovaries dance like grateful strawberries . But NOW my Indian name is Warrhameh . COYTOE ( Coytoe unties the fetus . ) Now the fetus . TECOYO No . COYTOE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to it while Coytoe tries to get it away from her . TECOYO NO ! ! Coytoe pulls the fetus away from her and beheads it on the guillotine of his chair . @x ( She makes a bird noise . ) COYTOE I think you 're in the breeding season . ( He is trying to skip stones across the water. ) p. 27 TECOYO No . I just do n't want to feel alone  --  COYTOE What do you think we have together ? TECOYO A relationship  --  COYTOE  --  between a man and woman  --  TECOYO The lesser wars . Until we get tired of one another and you find someone else . ( She fans herself . ) The greater wars , I suppose , are among nations . COYTOE What if you find someone else ? TECOYO It 's usually the male that leaves . That 's part of my " Bird " composition also . But there 's something more . I 'm not sure yet  --  I found that as we grew together , I was more like him . We could change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he became dependent on me in a way . I was part-him after all and he was part-she . We were one coyote looking at another . I want my spirit to get out from beneath the cracked paint of my face . I want to FLY over the edge of the earth to the sun . What if we could reach the sun like Icarus ? COYTOE You 'd be a well-done coyote . Fried rice , baby . Charred charisma . TECOYO I 'd be FREED rice . I 'd know the fullness of the light . p. 28 COYTOE You 'd be white lightness itself . TECOYO That 's what I 'd be . COYTOE That 's why we have wax wings on our heels , baby . The doors to paradise are closed . We ca n't get there from here . Not in ourselves as we are . We 'd pollute it anyway , just like we have the land we discovered and ourselves . TECOYO We 'd be pure and serene . COYTOE We 'd be dead  --  TECOYO  --  to ourselves and others . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? TECOYO I guess I did n't think the marriage would hold water , much less children . Conception did n't happen . Maybe I always felt kinked . ( Tecoyo holds her stomach . ) COYTOE How long were you married ? TECOYO Nine years . COYTOE Fox-trot with me , baby . One . Two . Three-four . Slow . Slow . Quick-quick . TECOYO I thought you 'd be like snow in Oklahoma . COYTOE But I held on . TECOYO Why am I so happy right now ? What 's wrong ? Is n't life for suffering ? They fox-trot again to the military music .
