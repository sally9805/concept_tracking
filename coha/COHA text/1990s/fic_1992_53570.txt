Cal used to be president of their fraternity . But then he was in a car wreck . Cal and Hap and a group of boys from the fraternity house had been out to the bars , and they were on their way home . Afterward Hap often pictured Cal dipping his hand into a cooler of beer , letting the water run off the can , popping the tab . Cal 's head was tilted back , Hap could see him in the rearview mirror , and it was when he looked back to the road that he saw the parked truck . Hap remembered , or thought he remembered , someone screaming , " Morn ? <p> John was n't hurt that bad . He was in the hospital for a few weeks , but then he did n't come back to school . He was still at home , working in his father 's auto parts store . He did n't drink anymore , he did n't go out . Talking to him , Hap remarked to people , you 'd think he was middle-aged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he graduated early , finished up his major , and got out of school and their fraternity as quietly as possible , packing up like a swindler without even saying goodbye . <p> It was Cal who got the worst part of it . He 'd ducked down at the last minute and covered his head , but it was his side of the car that was crushed . They had to cut him out of the wreckage , where he was pinned between the car door and the seat . <p> Cal was in a coma for nearly a month , and all that time they were expecting him to die . He woke up one morning , but he was n't the same person . There was brain damage and he had to go to a rehabilitation clinic . <p> Hap had been driving the car . He was n't drunk , and in fact he took a breathalizer at the site of the accident . All he could remember were the faces peering out of the slow ; moving cars , and the whiffpool of red and blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 'd had a beer or two , of course , but he was definitely within the legal limit . It was an accident . And it would n't happen again : he did n't drive anymore . <p> Not that anyone ever blamed him . Still , he sometimes noticed how their eyes darkened sidelong when he reached for another beer . He noticed how their faces suddenly tightened when he was in a good mood and got to laughing . It was as if , he thought , he 'd turned for a second into something unclean . <p> Hap tried to put everything back in order . They held an emergency meeting when they found out Cal would n't be returning , and since Hap was vice president at the time , they told him the presidency was his if he felt up to it . And so he stood there , with bandages on his head and hand , talking in nervous circles , saying how life had to go on , how Cal would have wanted it that way . <p> A few months after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The first time it happened was for real : he woke in the hallway , with no idea how he got there . Magic Marker was scribbled across his face and belly , as if he 'd been trying to write himself a message . <p> After that first time it became an act . On mornings after parties , his fraternity brothers began to find him in the foyer , cuffed up among the discarded advertisements and catalogues , or in the shower , fully dressed , with the water running , or outside under a tree , his hands caked with dirt as if he 'd been digging . At first they thought it was funny . They joked that Hap ought to have bells tied to his heels before he was allowed to drink a beer . Some of the incidents became amusing anecdotes . <p> He planned things in advance , considering which place might be most surprising , most ridiculous . One night he 'd squeezed onto a shelf on the trophy case , twisted around the gold statuettes of basketball players and wrestlers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't tell he was faking . He opened his eyes with a start , and sat straight up . One of the trophies fell clattering onto the living-room floor . <p> Often he 'd wait a long time before anyone found him . He 'd get frustrated , sometimes , and decide he was just going to forget it and go on up to bed . But then he 'd hear voices and his heart would pound and his mind would begin to whir like a fan . He could feel the shapes of them as they moved closer , slow , hovering , and he 'd open his eyes with a start to find them leaning over him like surgeons . Once this pre-med named Belcaster reached down and took his pulse . The pressure of his finger had run through Hap like an electric shock . He jerked straight up , and everyone had laughed , circled around him , shaking their heads . <p> But the novelty began to wear off . " Oh brother , " he heard Charlie Balbo say one morning . " Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hap 's arm . He was in ROTC and always woke up early to do exercises . Hap could hear Balbo sighing through his nose . " Rise and shine , buddy , " Balbo said , and when Hap fluttered his eyelids and moaned , none of them were smiling . Hap figured they were all thinking about the accident . <p> Cal 's mother called . Cal was back home , she told Hap , and she hoped some of his fraternity brothers would come for a visit . It had been six months since the accident . <p> Hap wondered how she 'd gotten his number . He had n't met her , really , just shook hands with her once during parents ' weekend when Cal pointed them at each other and said , " Morn this is Hap he 's one of my best pals , " or something like that , quick and stilted ; that was the way he talked . Later , after Cal had gone to the clinic , Hap sent a get-well card to his home . He 'd never visited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Cal 's doing real good , " he said . He 'd called the hospital a number of times , and that 's what they told him . " Under the circumstances , " they said , " he 's doing well . " <p> As the visit approached , Hap would feel a wave of panic pass over him , and he was desperate to call Cal 's mother and make some excuse . But what ? He could n't think of any excuse that would n't provoke disbelief . He would think of it from time to time , when he was n't expecting to . That Saturday , a week before he was to go , it was like a rushing at his back . <p> There was a party that night , and Hap had been downstairs long before anyone else , organizing guys to clear the furniture and push it against the wall , directing the football players to lift kegs of beer into ice-filled trash cans , hurrying to get the tap or the strobe light . There were certain things Hap did which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was the one who liked to put up decorations and make up themes for parties  --  putting red lights in the windows and taping up orange and yellow poster board in the shape of flames , so the house looked afire ; lining the dance floor with old mattresses and balloons ; setting up elaborate spreads of dips and vegetables and so on . He played the music , building up to the best dance songs , urging the crowd into a kind of frenzy . He 'd stand up on the window ledge and look out over their heads , calling out chants which the crowd would repeat . It was like a fiefdom , for one night at least . <p> Cal used to shake his head . " Geez , " he used to say . " Take a Valium . " Hap remembered one night , they 'd gone to this place , Elbow 's Room , where they did n't card . It was a dim , hazy bar , with country music on the jukebox , and they went there before a party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to miss anything . But Cal was in no hurry . Hap was telling him that he was going to miss the fraternity when they graduated , that it was one of his main reasons for staying in school , and Cal stared at him . His face was lit by the fireplace glow of neon , made spooky and dark by it . Hap was hoping he 'd say , " Me , too , " or even , " Yeah , when we go that place is dead . " But all he said was , " Christ , I ca n't wait to get out . You 're crazy , Hap . " He shrugged , and Hap felt something clench inside him ; it was like Cal was abandoning him . <p> That was one of the things that stuck in his mind that night . The dancing had died down early , and Hap was making his way upstairs to his room . There were four girls on their way to the ladies ' room when they saw Hap rubber-legging up the steps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , laughing . It was what he did , sometimes , he was n't sure why . He liked to act more drunk than he was . The girls wrapped their arms around his shoulders and guided him toward his room  --  someone in the hall directed them . Hap kept his eyes closed , and shortly he felt one of the girls sliding her hand in his back pocket to get his keys . " I ca n't believe I 'm doing this , " she said breathlessly , and another whispered , " Is he out ? " He was n't , of course . But when their grip loosened he slumped to the floor , and another girl said , " I guess he 's out . " They carried him in and put him on the bed , but he did n't sleep . The more he lay there , the more awake he became , listening to the music pulsing through the floor . A couple stood outside his door , thinking they had privacy , and murmured urgently  --  he could n't tell if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the party was over , nearly five in the morning , he went downstairs . He planned to pass out again , this time sprawled on the pool table . <p> It was a gray morning : It could have been dawn , or dusk again . When he passed the window in the stairwell a heavy bird lifted from the sill and blurred into the fog . It startled him , and he felt suddenly that there was someone watching him . He wondered if the house was all closed up . Often after a party he found the front door had n't been bolted or one of the fire exits was slightly ajar , or a window on the first floor was open , crepe paper streamers trailing off into the breeze . Sometimes it was hard to feel safe . <p> Everything seemed to pause , waiting . He peered in on each floor . All the doors were closed , lined up as still as motel rooms . Long shadows stretched in the dim hallways . He felt as if the place had been abandoned . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haze . No one had cleaned up after the party . The furniture was all cleared out still , and there were cups cluttered on every surface . From across the room he could hear the wind blowing through an open window . He squinted in the pale half-light . For a moment he was certain he saw the shape of someone standing there , a figure by the window , with the curtains fluttering around him . <p> " Hello , " he called , and his voice ran hollowly in the empty room . " Hello ? Is someone there ? " <p> And then he turned and ran up the stairs to his room . He bolted the door and put on the radio . He wanted to wake someone up , just to prove he was n't alone in the house . He kept turning the stereo louder , until at last Doug Cohn in the next room began knocking heavily on the wall between them . Hap turned off the stereo and sat there in the bed until it was light enough to sleep . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed like everything was back to normal . Hap would go downstairs in the late afternoon to find a group of guys standing around the pool table , tapping balls into the pockets with the palms of their hands , and the talk was all easy jokes and gossip . Mornings , he 'd walk into the bathroom , where a line of people from his floor were all at sinks , shaving , and move in beside them without a hitch . Even that next day , when he woke , there was a moment when he imagined himself shrugging to Doug Cohn , he heard himself chuckling , " Hey , thought I saw a ghost last night , Doug . Scared myself shitless . " <p> But later , when he saw Doug Cohn on his way out the front door with his bookbag , it seemed to him that the things he planned to say were frivolous and artificial . He drew back , acting as if he had n't noticed Doug , and he thought it was probably best not to mention anything at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would cruise along so easily . There was always some little snag to send him spinning . <p> The late afternoons were the worst , after everyone had gone off to the library or their girlfriends ' rooms . He flipped through channels in the television room , one after the other so the voices and music and yelps of white noise melted together in a collage , an abstract code he could almost recognize . Or he 'd end up back in his room , listening for someone to come down the hall , or making lists : party ideas ; things he planned to do tomorrow ; friends , in ascending order of closeness . He 'd number things from one through ten . It was calming to mark things down . <p> Sometimes he thought he would just give in , that he would let himself spend the whole day brooding about Cal , but he found he could n't . He tried to remember something specific about Cal , some significant conversation they had , the special things they used to do together . But his mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how once someone spray-painted ELIMINATE GREEKS on the outside of their house . They 'd circled the A in ELIMINATE , and there was a picture of Cal in the campus newspaper , standing in front of the big red A in his Greek letter sweatshirt and grinning . He recalled the time he and Cal came up with a way to combine philanthropy and partying . They planned to get a bunch of organ donor cards from the Department of Motor Vehicles and use them as admission tickets to a huge bash . They were going to have T-shirts that said : Lose Your Liver  --  donate an organ and have a beer ! <p> It seemed to Hap that all these memories were grotesque , like the old photos he 'd found once in his basement at home , pictures half-eaten by silverfish . He wondered if something was wrong with him . He believed that if things were the other way around , Cal would remember him better  --  that Cal would have fond stories of the night they pledged or the time they were both elected officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh . <p> He did n't know what the others were thinking . At the chapter meeting on Monday night , he announced as if effortlessly that " a group of brothers will be visiting Cal Fuller this Sunday , " and then went on with the other items on the agenda . When he scanned their faces he could n't read anything . Even the other three guys who planned to go to Cal 's house did n't seem to respond . Eric sat staring at the textbook he 'd opened on the table in from of him ; Charlie Balbo rocked back in his chair , balancing on two legs ; Russ , Cal 's freshman year roommate , traced his index finger across his palm . <p> He did n't know what he expected . But he did n't like it when Balbo patted him on the back , and said , " I guess you made it to bed Saturday night , for once . " He did n't like his own reply : " Yeah , your girlfriend showed me the way . " He gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face feel white and blank . <p> There was no party that Saturday and the house was unnaturally still . Yet he felt too edgy to go out . In the distance , up and down the fraternity quad , people were calling and laughing , on their way to other parties . Any other Saturday night , Hap would have been out there with them , on his way somewhere to unwind . He 'd melt into the heat and flex of crowded rooms , nodding at acquaintances , easing into casual conversations with girls , pressing into the shadows , and just letting the smoke and alcohol work through him . There might even be a moment , late at night , when everything seemed perfect  --  like the time he and Cal had sung " Papa 's Got a Brand New Bag " on their way home , very slowly , and there had been a few bars of clear harmony , echoing against the walls ; or the time an enormous raccoon had regarded him from a rain-soaked lawn , standing on its haunches , holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manholes , drifting low to the ground , all the way down the sidewalk . <p> Hap could see his reflection in the window , staring in at him . The ivy was thick across his window so he could n't see who was laughing outside . All he could see were twisting vines , the shadows of leaves showing through his reflection like an X-ray of something , he was n't sure what . This was what it was like for Cal , he thought  --  floating as people passed below you , as if you 'd levitated out of your own body . <p> When Russ knocked on the door , Hap was staring out the window and feeling as if he might jump out of his skin . He hoped there was n't an edge of desperation in his voice when he said , " Come on in , buddy . Have a beer with me . " <p> " I was just stopping by to let you know when we were going to leave in the morning , " Russ said . He glanced around as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hap handed him a beer , he sat there considering it . For a moment , they sat not saying anything , both moving their heads vaguely to the music that Hap had playing , constantly . <p> " So anyway , " Hap said at last . " It 'll be good to see Cal again , huh ? " <p> Russ shrugged . " I guess , " he said . He moved his mouth as if to say more , but then took a quick sip of beer instead . He swallowed . " I mean , you know , " he said . <p> " Well , anyway , they say he 's doing pretty well , " Hap said . " It 'll be cool . We 'll just sit around , shoot the breeze for a while . No big deal . " <p> They nodded at one another . Russ had never been easy to squeeze conversation out of ; some people used to say that if he had n't been roommates with Cal freshman year , he 'd have stayed in the dorms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed that it used to be easier to talk , even to Russ . Hap used to believe he could connect with most any of them , that they would all get together in twenty years and exchange gossip and old stories . He used to imagine that his fraternity brothers would think of him from time to time for the rest of their lives . Some little thing  --  the back of a head or a face glimpsed as an elevator closed  --  would startle them , and they 'd think suddenly : Hap ! What 's he up to these days ? <p> Russ lifted the beer to his lips ; when he set it down , a droplet of moisture trickled slowly down the side of the can . Russ seemed to be waiting for him to say something . But all he could think of was small talk , trivia : sororities , classes , sports teams . It made him cringe . Outside , the wind came up . Hap could hear the muffled buzz of a motorcycle speeding down a faraway street , someone showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't think it 'll be so bad tomorrow . " <p> They nodded at one another . " Yeah , " Russ said at last . " It should be all right . I mean , I 'm sure you 'll do fine . " <p> Hap said , " Hey , I 'll be sober , at least . " <p> Russ looked down and shook his head . " Yeah , " he said softly . <p> " No big deal , " Hap told him . " It wo n't be any big deal . " <p> Cal 's home was in a new development called Stone Lake . It was at the far edge of the suburbs , and some of the streets were n't marked clearly on Russ 's map . The trees had n't grown much yet , they were n't much taller than Hap , so the rows of houses stood bright and unshaded against the clear sky . <p> The boys were all still as they circled through Stone Lake , so quiet that Hap could hear Eric in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they passed a street sign , Russ slowed and gazed at it uneasily . At last , he pulled into a driveway . " This is the place , " he said . Hap saw him cast a quick look at Charlie Balbo . None of them seemed to look at him , though if they had he would have simply smiled firmly . <p> Cal 's mother came to the door , but she did n't open it right away . She peeked through the curtains , and they waved at her uncertainly . Hap could hear the bamboo wind chimes that hung from the porch , the deep hollow tones as they rustled in the breeze . Then he heard the lock being turned , and she stared at them through the half-open door . <p> " Hi , boys , " she said . <p> " Hi , " they echoed . They stood for a moment on the threshold , and she took Russ 's hand . He 'd stayed over one Thanksgiving , and she spoke lightly : " Good to see you again , Russ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of them . Eric and Charlie introduced themselves quickly , and she shook their hands , too . " Welcome , Charlie , Eric , " she said . Then she smiled at Hap . <p> " I 'm Hap , " he said . " We talked on the phone . " <p> " Of course , " she said . " I believe I met you once at a reception . " She had dark eyes . They seemed wet and glittering as their hands met . Hap thought that maybe she was wishing the same thing on him , wishing him crippled or dead , though she held his hand for a long moment , tightly . She was always angry with Cal , Hap remembered , she always complained that he spent too much time socializing and not enough studying . Hap wondered if she thought it was he who led Cal astray . He wished he could tell her that everything , everything had always been Cal 's idea . " You 're very lucky , " she said softly , and dropped his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Cal  --  as a baby ; as a long-haired high-school boy ; another that Hap recognized as the one Cal had taken for the fraternity composite when he was elected president . They walked into a living room , and it was then that they saw him . He was sitting cross-legged on the floor , watching an old black-and-white movie on television . He did n't move . He had his face turned away from them , and the mother seemed not to notice him . <p> " Can I get you anything to drink ? " she asked , and it sent a shiver through Hap as if it were an accusation . " Coke ? Milk ? Water ? " <p> As she went toward the kitchen , Cal looked up , and Hap lifted his hand hesitantly , as if to wave , or to shield his face . But Cal let his eyes drift shyly over them , then turned back to the TV . He did n't recognize them , Hap realized . Their stares made him shift bashfully . He leaned toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vanish . None of them looked at one another , or spoke . Hap just watched the screen , thinking that all of them were sharing the same images , at least . <p> The curtains had been drawn , so the TV was brighter . The sleepy dimness of the room reminded Hap of winter , of childhood sicknesses . Everything was muted . In the distance , beyond the tinny , old-movie voices , he could hear ice cubes being cracked into glasses . <p> Mrs. Fuller came in , carrying their drinks on a tray . Cal continued to watch the television until she said , " Cal , honey , " very firmly . Then he looked up at her impatiently . Hap tried not to glance at him . He held tightly to his glass , staring down into it . <p> " Do you see your friends ? " Mrs. Fuller said . " Look who 's come to visit you ! " <p> " Hi , " Cal sighed , and Hap 's hands began to throb . He was n't the same person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polite smile , but he knew it looked false . All he could think was that Cal must be in that body somewhere , but sleeping , or maybe only vaguely aware , like someone drugged ; he imagined the real Cal was submerged somehow , curled up like a fist , struggling to break out . <p> " How 's it going , Cal ? " he said , and Cal gazed up at him . Russ and Eric and Charlie were lined up on the long sofa that faced the television , and Hap was a little apart from them , in a high-backed easy chair , his hands clasped tightly in front of him . Everyone was watching him . " How 's it going ? " he said again , but Cal did n't answer . He glanced back at the movie . <p> " Cal , " Mrs. Fuller said , in her calm , stem voice . She got up and shut off the TV , and Cal 's head turned as she went , noting each movement wistfully . " Look , Cal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> He hung his head . " My friends , " he whispered . <p> She was close to him , avid , bright-eyed . She lifted her finger suddenly and pointed at Hap . His heart leapt . " Who 's that boy , Cal ? Who is that ? " <p> Hap caught his breath , stiffening , but Cal was silent . The quiet stretched out like a long shadow , and Hap felt that all of them were waiting for him to do something . He stood up . For a moment , he just wavered there , awkwardly , as if he 'd been asked to give a speech , but at last he began to move forward a bit , smiling at Cal , nodding encouragingly . " Who am I , Cal ? " he whispered , so soft he could barely hear himself , and Cal closed his eyes . He slumped down , and for a moment Hap thought he 'd fainted . But then his eyes snapped back open . " I do n't know , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inching forward , holding out his hand , though he could see that Cal did n't quite trust him ; he drew back a little , the way a child would when a stranger 's friendliness seemed false . " Hey , " Hap said . " It 's me , Cal . " He raised his voice . " It 's me . You know  --  Hap . " Cal sat there on the rug in front of the television , his legs tucked carefully under him , and Hap just hovered there , looking down on him . He thought that maybe he ought to crouch down on the floor , too , so that Cal could see him face to face , but before he could , Cal stood up and walked over to his mother . He sat down next to her , leaving Hap alone in the middle of the room , facing all of them . <p> Mrs. Fuller put her arms around Cal , and he leaned his head against her shoulder . " When he came out of the coma , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd surrounded him  --  " he did n't even know who I was . " She smiled ruefully . " He was like a baby again : could n't dress himself , feed himself , anything . But he 's come a long way . " She could n't look up . They all watched her , hypnotized , as she spoke in a slow , sweet voice , as if to Cal . She told them how happy she 'd been when he 'd drawn a circle on a piece of paper , when he played a game of Chutes and Ladders with a nurse . " Who knows what he remembers ? " she whispered , her mouth close to Cal 's ear . " He 'll look at those pictures from your fraternity for hours . He 's just fascinated . And sometimes he 'll say something and he 'll sound almost like himself . " <p> She sighed . " But you ca n't think of it that way , " she said . " He 's a new person now . And we have to love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not any less , " she said . " Just different . " She laid her hand on Cal 's cheek , and he nuzzled against her . There was a long silence , and at last , the spell broken , Hap edged back to his chair . That was it , he thought . Cal was gone . He imagined a bright flash burning everything clean , leaving only a blurred whiteness , a hiss of static . He saw it so clearly that for a minute he felt as if the chair were tilting underneath him . He put his hands on the arms , tightly . <p> " Of course , he 'll always need to be taken care of , " Mrs. Fuller said at last . " Like a little boy . " Then she was quiet again , stroking Cal 's hair , watching the movement of her hand as if mesmerized . <p> " You see how his forehead is scarred , " she murmured finally . A kind of thrum went over Hap 's skin as she brushed Cal 's bangs back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's hard to believe , is n't it ? That 's the pattern of the car seat . And he was pushed forward with so much force that the imprint is still there . " She was moving her hand slowly through his hair , as if thinking of something far off , but her eyes were fixed on Hap . He could n't meet her gaze ; he could only look at Cal , who was enjoying the touch of his mother 's fingers over his brow . He had his head tilted back , his expression relaxed , staring up as if stargazing . And for a moment , Hap felt as if he himself was up there in the distance , a meteor shrinking into the stratosphere , layers sloughing off him in fiery husks until he was just a tiny speck , plunging into the dark . He and Cal stared up toward some distant point , and for a moment he felt as if he were about to remember something important , something he 'd forgotten . But then it was gone . <p> No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drove home . They each took a corner of the car , each tilted in different directions like compass points . Russ held the steering wheel in both hands , staring out at the signs , the road . Eric turned his face away from Hap , resting his head against the window , pretending to be asleep . <p> It almost seemed as if it were late at night , that the world was calm and dark . But it was still daylight , and when Hap closed his eyes , orange flashes beat irregularly against his closed eyelids : the sun , flickering through the trees . <p> On the very edge of sleep , Hap could feel the shape of a dream . It was a party , and Hap had just joined the fraternity . He could see someone moving toward the dancing crowd , clapping his hands , shouting . Everything began to stop : the music faded , the lights came up . One after another , the dancing couples separated , began to clap in rhythm , and the men from the fraternity emerged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was up above their heads , carried on a rippling of dozens of hands . Their chanting echoed beneath him as they poured out into the open air , under the night sky . He was floating , and when he looked down he saw a boy waving at him , at the end of a long tunnel of people . Cal ! he thought . <p> He started up with a laugh . <p> <p> By Dan Chaon <p> Dan Chaon has published stories in TriQuarterly , Story , Crazyhorse , and other magazines .
