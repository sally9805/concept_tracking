PERHAPS YOU WO N'T BELIEVE IT , but this year I 've been given three pens , all presents . The first was Mont Blanc from my mother . I found it in the mail on my birthday . The next was a replacement for the Waterman I lost while driving through Pennsylvania on that viciously hot afternoon when my pockets decided to empty their pennies onto the floorboard . It was a Christmas present given by someone who loves me and , come to think , it might still be in the car someplace ( itself in a wrecking yard in South Bronx now ) . Should we speak , this woman and myself , she might say I love you to distraction . And in return do I ? Yes , but not to distraction . ( She turned her attention to me , our car came together with another car and itself ceased to be a car somewhere on the Cross Bronx Expressway . ) I myself have moved on and been moved on from . <p> Among the things I packed when I left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as was the Crackerjack prize in the movie , at Tiffany 's on 57th street in New York . It was a Crackerjack ring . It was in the book about Tiffany 's as well if memory serves . So it is a Tiffany pen , plain silver , and the woman who gave it to me had no business doing so . She sprung it on me , took me there , to 57th street . A gift , darling ! She paid cab fare and told the driver which streets were best , got us through the midtown roil , and it is appreciated , my appreciation is unshakable once won . A bolt from the blue , darling ! Though maybe my appreciation seems as unwarranted as the gift that occasions it . <p> You see , we were arguing about the best street to take crosstown through the rushing murder of that hour . For a moment it seemed like a regular spat , but the enemy face across from mine stiffened according to another 's way . We were stuck on some disagreed upon street . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in time . She knew a shuntstreet and directed the cab . We were wondering about the next step between us . I conceded and she made her face her own again and our spat fizzed away like love . We came to be of the opinion that we needed a rest , a bed . At the time I said Yes , let 's go , but , by all means , let 's hurry . This was midtown , after all . <p> It should come as no surprise then that it was the Mont Blanc that I elected to use after the strikers in typewriter knotted themselves together , as far as I can tell , for good . It is the heaviest of the three , weight is its best aspect , one feels the momentum of putting the Mont Blanc into motion . Or else one comes to mistake that mechanical energy for the power of imagination . A heavy thing has a force of its own which can see you through any sort of murder . <p> Until now I had always mistrusted the shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hands of movie stars playing the diplomats who sign away the homefront 's false futures ( PEACE IN OUR TIME , indeed ) , customs officers with an eye out for forged visas-I ca n't remember a single actor 's name right now . In the last two weeks , with my own Mont Blanc , I drafted a play-either The Consulate or In Spite of Tennis the Skull . Who can decide ? Paul Henreid . It is imaginable that Paul Henreid used one to play his cuckold 's role in Casablanca . <p> The others have their good points as well : the Waterman has a blue cartridge , the Tiffany is nice to pick up on a summer morning already warm enough to curl paper . I 'm writing this with the Mont Blanc and already you may have noticed I 'm straying off into more fantastic , less vital , subjects . <p> It still makes me smile when I remember that the original draft of this manuscript was undertaken on the verso side of a transcription of Norman di Giovanni 's translation of Borges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself , typed it out straight from the pages of his complete works . I did it because , after writing this play that , by all that is right , ought to be called The Consulate , I have energyor gall-enough to attempt a dramatization of the Argentine 's wondrous story . Perhaps you wo n't believe this either , but said transcription is what caused my machine to tie itself into knots . Maybe the question is less one of vigor than the suspicion I might be the appropriate writer to stage the Borges , given my background . Or this rectitude may simply be the after-effect of the mistaken Mont Blanc energy I mentioned . <p> I have only loved one person to absolute , prolonged distraction . <p> The Tiffany has n't dulled with use , or tarnished , so I wonder if it is truly silver . Or is it the other way around ? False silver tarnishes ? The Waterman has been marbled to recall those endpapers one enjoys in antique books . The Waterman looks most like itself , unmistakable for a nail , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The clip , the part of the Mont Blanc that clips to your shirt if you are in the habit of carrying a pen in your shirt pocket-it surely ca n't be gold , though the pamphlet that fluttered from the gift box made that specific claim . It has assumed , with my handling , the clip has , the same grainy texture of the pennies I collected as a boy . <p> She , this Her I love above all others , authored up a big misery in me in response to a certain aggregation of words and lines known as Not Her in my play now most certainly titled The Consolate . <p> I would bathe my pennies in a solution of vinegar and salt before I felt safe in dropping them into my piggy bank . ( The solution I whipped up in my youthful vigor is evidently a domestic version of hydrochloric acid ! ) I remember the clip of the Mont Blanc retaining its golden finish for a few weeks only . Dios mio ! Who , then , will direct the movie , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the indescribable color for yourselves ? Her mistook herself for Not Her of course-it often happens that way , does it not , the offense ? <p> Her reminded one slightly of Meg Ryan , yes . <p> Not Meg Ryan was my little pet name for Her , yes . <p> The clip , the shirt clip , of the Tiffany has been struck in the shape of a roman T. For Tiffany 's , darling , explained my presenter , known hereafter as Darling . It was n't necessary to explain , she knew it , she knew I would find it charming anyway . She knew how to say it in a way that would charm me , like the famous actress . <p> Darling . And she is . Everything went into that word , it was all that mattered , that I be charmed and undivided . Quite a lot of attention to manage at once for me . Quite a lot of mechanical energy was spent upon my body en route from 57th street . Darling 's darling little fists fluttered all over my head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is bent , or rendered italic-owing to my habit of putting things into my pants pockets without a second thought as to what they are or whether there might be a better place for them someplace else . I often find , for example , that I 've absconded with more than a few of those little wooden sticks used for stirring coffee . Toothpicks dart beneath my nails when I paw for change . And I 'm forever seeing the world through the scratches my housekeys have scored into my sunglasses . The key to the house in Westchester is , come to think , still among them . <p> Forgive me if this sentence seems as misplaced as the history of my appreciations , but this year my father gave me his edition of Borges 's Obras Completas , the edition his father gave to him when my father was my age . It is the Emece edition , three volumes bound in leather with marbled endpapers . Borges was alive when it was printed and had much more to write , he was not nearly done . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder if I should continue . I 'm on my second page of the Borges transcription , nearly the third , and my pockets are beginning to feel overburdened and in drastic need of emptying . I do n't want to run the risk of appearing over-excited in the pockets area when the family sitting nearby sees me stand up to use the men 's . <p> I always find myself in a family place , it seems . <p> Truth is , this is coming so fast , seemingly at the same moment-how can this be the truth , since last August I myself have become mistrustful when events seem to go apace . I 'm afraid to stand up , since the moving on of Not Meg Ryan . I should stand up and cry my eyes out . I wonder how many sentences Borges lost standing up from his busywork at the Argentine national library to tap out his trips to the men 's . <p> I just went back a few lines , to the one about the house in Westchester , the one about marbled endpapers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let it all stand as a reminder , a reminder not to stray . <p> Like the Tiffany , the Mont Blanc may be twisted at its middle . The Waterman has a removeable cap , easily lost . One twists the Tiffany or the Mont Blanc until the nib exposes itself . Please do n't worry , you wo n't catch me making the claim that the nib is the hidden soul of the pen . The threads along which the Tiffany twists have weakened or I 've opened it too quickly too many times , it was that sort of affair between us , quick , tortional , torquey . I made certain concessions for the sake of speedy resolution , we overcame the midtown murder hidden inside us , I turned myself one way in bed , then another . We wept together a little over everything , Darling and I did . <p> So what I 'm after now is to say that , once opened , there is revealed a gap between the component parts of the Tiffany . I know there was a time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down at the gap out of boredom and , out of the same boredom , think the gap to be significant of something if only for a second before I dropped it in there with the keys and the likewise large , and ever growing , family of pennies that happily breeds in my pockets . Would you believe me if I were to also tell you that it helps to have an obsessive thought , something like that meaningless mechanical gap , when one makes his living working in a library ? Thought spent upon a gap , a coin , in ignorance of books , makes the day sing a forgetful song . <p> My father , a South American , keeps the Mont Blanc my mother gave to him as an emblem of her constant affection clipped safely to his shirt pocket . I think of this habit as significant of his class and his occupation . Like many South Americans of his class , he travels widely , knows many unlikely people , he makes many business trips abroad . This must sound like a conceit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mont Blanc , my mother once gave him a Waterman not unlike my own . A step up from my model , it is a better one than my model of course , she must love him very much if affection is gauged in terms of the pens received . I remember him with a Waterman , even though my own is least used of the three pens I have won . He is a practical man , impatient , and it pleases me to think of all the opportunities he has over the course of his travels to misplace his personal effects . What a perfect excuse that would be if I could misplace the Tiffany and allow the Waterman to slip inside my pocket , or into my imagination , without another thought . <p> My play The Consulate or The Consolate is populated by certain aggregations of words and lines , stuff allegedly said . Of course , it is some star 's job to mistake those aggregations for people , not mine . <p> It is Meg Ryan 's job , not mine . <p> It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last August I 've come to realize how confused my father sometimes becomes , how tired he is from having traveled so far and so fast . I could easily place the Tiffany among his personal effects and he would mistake it for one of his own pens . He might think my mother put it under the tree for him , a present bought on one of her frequent junkets to New York from Texas . A sly plant straight out of Hitchcock , it might take him years to notice the shirt clip is fashioned in the shape of a T. Tiffany 's . He might never make the connection . Our initials-believe this if nothing elseby some design of his and my mother 's , are exactly the same initials that are engraved on the Tiffany . <p> I did n't mention it but , just now , I needlessly endangered the Waterman . I left it out on the cafe table while I made my trip to the men 's . The mistake was possible because today I 've taken two pens off my desk to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mont Blanc , remember-the Tiffany is at home waiting to make out a check to the phone company . My intent behind using the two pens , my method rather , was to underline instances of dialog within " The Aleph " in black and then mark out the various physical settings in blue ( hence the Waterman ) so that the form of a play might begin in my imagination . I left my so-called materials on the table to save it from being taken over by the family sitting near me . I 've seen them here before , always on Sundays . They are Spanish and shameless about incorporating vacant tables into an ever-enlarging surface over which they shout and clap at one another . Cielos ! They must imagine nobody in the world but them understands Spanish ! <p> Instead of putting both pens into my pocket as is my habit when I have to make use of the men 's , I left the Waterman atop the original manuscript version of this piece to keep it from the winds . What 's more , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ al fresco but within arm 's reach of my possessions . ( Please do not think I am addicted to window seats , or even , especially , to working in cafes . I come here because it is the only place I can pay in cents without being judged . ) These men , these agents , were wearing rep ties tied in thick knots . They seemed outof-bounds , even for this cafe . One could tell nothing about their class or occupation . They stared back , necked in the rampant colors of no known college or regiment . I put my sunglasses on and went to the men 's . <p> The danger is over now but , had the Waterman been stolen , I would have to depend on the woman who once said , in all sincerity , I ca n't imagine living without you to restore the balance I in turn depend on by providing me with yet a third Waterman . My mother is capable of doing so-of taking the dear woman 's place . She would . I would have to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean less , if my mother were to give me a Waterman next year . How could I confess its loss ? It would be easier to explain how I came upon the Tiffany that I palmed and tossed into a crate so quickly last August-I 'm entirely content to let the story of the Tiffany emerge over the course of years and plays and arrangements of words and lines . <p> I ca n't imagine living without you . It was one of her lines , the Lover 's . She sometimes said that to me from behind her own sunglasses while driving on the New York Throughway . Where we lived in Westchester , in the shadow of the Throughway , was where the police always stop the train each time I watch them in pursuit of Cary Grant in North by Northwest . <p> I do n't think they touched it , the agents , and they were gone by the time I returned . I was n't sure at first , but I decided it was better not to go on the lamb . Between now and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more respect when in the future I stand up to use the men 's . <p> My plan was to continue this into a longer piece , one that made use of the reverse side of each page of the DiGiovanni , or of the Borges , or whatever this is that my typewriter gave its life for , but-who knows why , really ? I have to stop . I found that I was missing nine pages of the transcription anyway , and I 've written this in a hand too large , and pages one through nine turned up later that afternoon , primly underneath the Tiffany . Pages one through nine caused my telephone to be disconnected briefly because they obscured the bill past due . The surroundings were promising when I first wrote this down , I think I could have easily gone on . Spanish guitarists arrived in the cafe much to the delight of the Spanish family . I could have described the guitars maybe and there is a postcard yet unmentioned that I was about to put in the mailbox across the street . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an actress who lives in Texas , on which postcard I drew my self-portrait in imitation of the publicity shot she had sent me only the week before . I drew it in black , with the Mont Blanc . I drew myself with my hand dramatically to my forehead in the same manner Carmen holds hers in the publicity shot . My tie has been loosened by someone . I have n't been shaved . Perhaps I 've learned a few things about dramatic effect myself since last August and since Not Meg Ryan took herself away with all the mystery of lemon juice runes toothpicked between the lines of a common love letter . I scratched myself out for Carmen , standing in a field of flowers , al fiori , before a fictitious skyline featuring many odd and ancient monuments . A river must be hidden below the floral horizon I drew and Carmen Nogales of El Paso , Texas , is clever enough to notice that my drawing lacks a river and then imagine it for herself . On the reverse side I wrote that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I lined , but you have a face fit for the movies . Cheers , Chico . <p> Buddy Ebsen , he is the actor who took the bus from Texas to New York so that he could eat an important box of Crackerjacks while sitting on a bench at the Newman bandshell - it was Buddy Ebsen who tried to make all the difference by enduring such a long trip for the sake of his darling . <p> Years ago , about the time an uncle of mine gave me , to my enduring horror , a jar of steel pennies upon which hydrochloric acid had little effect , I saw the Trinity river at flood stage . The area surrounding this uncle and my father and my mother and myself had become as a lake . As it happens every year , it seems . Nobody much mentions it . This is Forth Worth , Texas , mind you , and we are silent as lakes ourselves . But sometimes things spill out without warning . For example , I had just paid the toll to cross over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and boiled to the floorboard of the Lover 's car . <p> Another river , a South American one , was named by the Spanish in hope that upstream ore would be discovered in the blank spaces on the charts . The Spanish sailed leftward , toward the west edge of the page , and the cartographers drew until the blank spaces had been filled with chunky geography and , in riverbends where the sextants failed , there surfaced cinematic monsters . Such maps these are , as predicted by Borges . All this has been written in black . All this has been written in blue . The prows dipped into the bank and the horses rumbled off . Darling , is the Tiffany 's in Buenos Aires to be found on Calle Garay or , as is more likely , somewhere in Recolcta ? By all means , endure the trip , explore , check out each location that the cab driver suggests , go along , recover to recover . Rio de la Plata , by the time it has run as far as the city , can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Uruguay is there , nevertheless . <p>
