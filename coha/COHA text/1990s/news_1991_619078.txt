<p> This year 's 1.5 percentage point decline in home loan mortgage rates to their lowest levels in nearly two decades has set off a refinancing stampede . <p> Facing a stagnant economy and sluggish real-estate market , bankers across the country have cut the average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage to 8.5 percent  --  the lowest since 1974 . <p> On one-year adjustable rate home loans , lenders were asking an average initial rate of 6.21 percent , the lowest since Freddie Mac began tracking ARMs in 1984 . Some adjustable rate mortgages , which can be reset after a year , have even dropped below 5 percent . <p> Last Friday 's move by the Federal Reserve to slash its key discount rate by a full percentage point to a 27-year low of 3.5 percent to resuscitate the economy will usher in even lower mortgage rates . <p> Seeing a way to save money in hard times , homeowners are rushing to cut payments or shorten the length of their mortgages by trading in their old loans for new , lower-rate models . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has more than tripled , according to the Mortgage Bankers Association . Such trade-ins now account for 60 percent of all home loans . For the year , the MBA expects the dollar volume of refinancings will climb to $ 162 billion from $ 72 billion last year . <p> In California , where higher-priced homes force many homeowners to take out larger loans that incur higher interest rates than the national average , refinancings accounted for 72 percent of all new loans , according to a survey by HSH Associates , a Butler , N.J.-based mortgage information publisher . Normally , refinancings account for only 15 to 20 percent of new home loans . <p> " A lot of consumers are taking this opportunity to save a lot of money , " said Richard Peach , deputy chief economist for the MBA in Washington , D.C. <p> Kevin and Deborah Collis are among the homeowners taking advantage of lower rates . The Danville couple recently traded in a $ 260,000 , 30-year fixed mortgage at 10.25 percent for a 15-year mortgage for the same amount at 8.625 percent . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four-bedroom home , compared with $ 2,360 that was required for the previous loan . However , the couple will only be out $ 50 more a month because they were paying down the 30- year loan at a faster pace . <p> " We wo n't realize any monthly savings , " said Collis , a 35-year-old accountant , who said he may add to his monthly payments each year in order to pay off the mortgage sooner . " My goal is to be positioned to have it paid off in 10 years so I can pay for my 6-month-old daughter 's college education . " <p> He estimates that the lower rate combined with the shorter term will save him $ 300,000 over the life of the loan . " By the time she 's ready for college , that should cover about a year at Stanford , " he said with a chuckle . <p> The Collises are typical of homeowners who are using the savings from refinancing to pay down or consolidate debt , according to Peach of the MBA . <p> " Anecdotally , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their refinancing business comes from borrowers with 30- year fixed mortgages switching into 15-year fixed loans , " he said . <p> Gary Zimmerman , economist for the Federal Reserve in San Francisco , points out that nationally , total consumer loans outstanding  --  including credit cards and auto loans held by banks  --  declined to $ 366.1 billion in September from $ 388.2 billion in September 1990 . <p> " That does suggest consumers are paying down their nonreal-estate debt , primarily because tax credits are no longer available for such debt , " he said . <p> For wage earners , the 1986 tax law phased out the deduction for all interest except mortgages . Last year , consumers could deduct only 10 percent of payments on such loans , and this year the deduction has vanished completely . As a result , it makes sense for many people to pay off those debts and consolidate them under mortgage or home equity loans where interest rates are lower and payments are deductible from earnings . <p> Tom Holloway , senior economist for the MBA , said he expects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stimulate the economy by easing interest rates . " We might see 30-year , fixed rate mortgages getting down to 8.25 percent by mid-1992 , " he said . <p> Although the interest rate cuts have been a boon for many consumers , they also have translated into a business boom for some lenders in the badly battered bank and savings-and-loan industry . <p> Most lenders do not make money on new loans or refinancings , since the points and fees they charge typically go to offset overhead costs . However , they do make money on holding the loans in their portfolio and collecting payments  --  about three-eighths of a percent on each loan , according to Keith Gumbinger , an analyst with HSH Associates . <p> Gumbinger said the refinancing boom will help some lenders and hurt others . He said some lenders may gain a larger share of the mortgage lending business . But others  --  particularly those who previously held large portfolios of adjustable rate mortgages  --  are likely to lose out as their customers shop around for lower-cost , fixed-rate loans . <p> " The current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching the feathers fly , " he said . " When the feathers land , some piles will be bigger than others . " <p> Tom Hallman , director of the mortgage business for Citibank in California , said that the bank 's volume of home loans is $ 2.1 billion , up about $ 100 million from last year . Refinancings accounted for a larger share of that volume in the second half of the year , offsetting a decline in new mortgages for home purchases . <p> Refinancings have doubled to about 60 percent of the bank 's mortgage business . In typical times , refinancings make up only 20 percent to 30 percent of the bank 's mortgage volume . <p> Similarly , IMCO Realty Services , a Santa Rosa-based mortgage lender , said the refinancing craze has helped boost total loan volume this November to $ 517 million from $ 212 million last November . <p> Despite the crush of business , many lenders are hiring fewer people and say they are still better equipped to handle the piles of applications than they were in 1986 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in eight years . A major reason is that computers now are used more extensively to process loan applications . Although many lenders report that the crush may be extending processing time to three weeks from two , they claim that they do not suffer from a shortage of workers as they did in 1986 , when applications sometimes were tied up for a month or longer . <p> IMCO , for example , has added only about 50 people to its staff of 1,400 . Terence Hodel , chief executive of the mortgage banking company , said some of his staff is working 14-hour days , seven days a week , to handle the applications . <p> Hallman of Citibank said the bank has cross-trained about 30 percent of its loan officers who otherwise handle consumer loan applications . During the refinancing rush it also is hiring temporary workers . <p> Lenders are divided on what the current refinancing mania means for the overall economy . <p> Frank Schultz , executive vice president and head of the residential loan division for Bank of America , said there has n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower interest rates to translate into purchases that could stimulate the economy . He notes that his own mortgage loan volume will be " up a lot " over last year 's $ 7 billion mark , with refinancings accounting for 50 percent of the business this year , vs. 35 percent last year . <p> " My personal theory is that with millions of households going to lower mortgage payments , this refinancing wave will soon start freeing up consumer spending , " he said . <p> But Joe Garrett , president of American Liberty Bank in Oakland , said most of his applicants are people who are getting their financial houses in order . To them refinancing means fewer cutbacks , not a buying binge . <p> " We 're not seeing many people refinance their homes in order to take equity out of their homes to build a new deck or swimming pool , as you would in a traditional refinance period , " he said . " What we we are seeing is a lot of debt consolidation , or people taking out a little extra money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're scared they may lose their jobs and want a little cushion . "
