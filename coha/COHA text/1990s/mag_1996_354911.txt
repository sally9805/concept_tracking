The new company , to be called Bell Atlantic , will have revenues of nearly $27 billion , second only to those of AT &T; in the business , and will offer a wealth of data services to about 36 million East Coast customers  --  some 22% of all U.S. subscribers . <P> The deal , which comes just weeks after the $17 billion-merger announcement of Pacific Telesis and SBC Communications ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have hit their Terrible Teens .
