When the World Future Society began a few decades ago , I have to admit that I regarded it with a certain amount of professional jealousy . You see , I 'm a science-fiction writer . I do sometimes write other things , anywhere from encyclopedia essays on ancient history to mainstream novels , even the occasional poem . But when I sit down at my word processor , it is usually science fiction that comes out . When WFS was born , I felt I had a certain amount of seniority in the business of thinking about the future . After all , I had been busy at the job of anatomizing events that had n't actually happened-not yet , anyway-for close to 30 years . Then , without warning , along came all these new guys-scientists and academics , people from the think tanks of government and industry-who were invading a turf that a few score of us pioneering future historians had long since marked out as our own . As it turned out , the relationship between science fiction and futurology turned out to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was quite a shock at the time . Science Fiction and the Future Of course , there are considerable differences between science fiction and formal futurology . Very few people base their decisions for planning a new factory or building a municipal water supply on a science-fiction story . ( Though it might be argued that , now and then , they might be just as well off if they did . ) That is n't what science fiction is for . Whatever merits it may possess , it is n't meant to predict the future . Not every science-fiction writer has understood this . Hugo Gernsback , for instance , had just the opposite opinion . Gernsback was as close to a founding father as American science fiction ever had . Among other things , he started the world 's first science-fiction magazine , Amazing Stories , in 1926 . In his own fiction , notably the novel Ralph 124C41+ , Gernsback spent most of his effort in attempting to describe what the next century 's inventions would look like . On the contents page of every issue of Amazing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Today-Cold Fact Tomorrow . " It has n't worked out that way Those early issues of Amazing Stories were full of stories about high-tech Martian warriors invading Earth or tough American adventurers exploring the swampy jungles of the planet Venus . Those things did n't happen , and it seems pretty clear now that they never will . Even the predictions in Gernsback 's own novel missed their mark . Though he took it for granted that things like radar and television would become commonplace , he had the technological details remarkably wrong . His television sets were basically photophones ; apparently the idea of broadcast television never occurred to him . Gernsback was n't the worst . If you want to know just how wrong science fiction can be , let me tell you about an ancient movie called Just Imagine . It starred the Swedish dialect comedian El Brendel and the lovely young Maureen O'Sullivan , in what I think was her first appearance on an American screen . I saw it in 1930 , when I was 10 years old , and marveled at the picture it gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 1980 , people no longer had names but serial numbers ( a notion , I have always suspected , that they got from Ralph 124C41+ ) . Meals came in the form of pills , with no necessity for cutting steaks or spooning up a bowl of soup . The skyscraper city of New York suffered from heavily congested traffic , but of autogyros , not cars . And when a young couple desired a baby , they simply put a coin in a vending machine and the infant popped out . On the way home from the movie , I said to my mother , " Gee , I wish I could see that . " She startled me by saying , " Listen , son , there 's a pretty good chance that you will . " Well , I did . Sort of . That is , 1980 has come and gone , but I still have to cut my steaks , and all of my children and grandchildren have arrived in the timetested way Of course , Just Imagine was a comedy . It was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crystal ball has been just as clouded for others who deserve to be taken more seriously-even so sharp an article as my esteemed friend and colleague , Arthur C. Clarke . Among other things in Clarke 's film and novel , 2001 , there is a section describing regular Pan Am flights to a space station and then to the moon , proving once again that it 's always a mistake for a science-fiction writer to put a date on his imaginings . Now we 're getting close enough to that year that we 're pretty sure this sort of all-frills lunar commuting just is n't going to happennot to mention that there is n't even a Pan Am anymore . Trying to Predict Breakthroughs Of course , very important people are n't going to trust science-fiction writers to tell them about the future anyway . They 're going to want heavyweight scientists for the job . In his 1995 presidential address to the British Association for the Advancement of Science , Martin Rees spoke of one early effort . In 1937 , the Great Depression was stubbornly refusing to end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his New Deal . What Roosevelt was hoping for was some new technologies that would spawn great new industries , in the way that radio and automobiles had done . Accordingly , he asked the National Academy of Sciences to predict forthcoming scientific breakthroughs . They did their best . They quite correctly anticipated such things as synthetic rubber and gasoline , as well as significant changes in agriculture . But , as Rees reminds us , the really big new technologies and industries-nuclear energy , antibiotics , jet aircraft , and even computers-they missed entirely . Of course , that was more than half a century ago and there have been some improvements since then , particularly in highly specialized areas of prediction . Weather forecasting , for example , is a lot better than it was in the World War II days when I was a weatherman for the U.S. Air Force in Italy . If you happen to be pregnant , your friendly local obstetrician can reliably tell you whether the child will be male or female . And if you 're considering the purchase of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around your ears , seismologists can tell you where earthquakes are likely to occur . But even predictions of these sorts have their limitations . The weather service is good at identifying tropical disturbances that are likely to turn into hurricanes , but predicting whether any one of them will take the roof off your house-or somebody else 's 30 or 40 miles down the coast-is beyond their skills . Predicting a child 's gender is routine , but there 's a reason for that . That is because it is n't a real prediction at all . What the amniocentesis reveals is not what a baby will be , but what it already is-the fetus has already made the malefemale decision , but you just ca n't detect the evidence from outside . And earthquake prediction is an example of the kind of fuzzy future forecast that Charles Galton Darwin was talking about many years ago when he wrote a book called The Next Million Years . My copy of that volume has long since disappeared , but there was one disclaimer at the beginning that has stuck in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea what devastating natural disasters would happen in the next year or even 10 years in the future . But he added that no one else did either . On the other hand , Darwin was confident that he knew what sorts of things would happen over the longer term , because in the course of a million years , all the infrequent things that could happen no doubt would happen . There might or might not be catastrophic earthquakes , droughts , famines , or pestilences happening next year , but over the next 10,000 centuries there was no question that , statistically speaking , sooner or later they would definitely happen . Of course-as all Southern Californians and Japanese have learnedthere is n't much immediate value in knowing that something will sooner or later happen , but not knowing exactly when it will . What we would like to do is to pin down actual dates . More than that , we would like to be able to forecast all sorts of other things , such as the future demand for utilities , the price of commodities , up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results of political elections . Another big one could be whether employment opportunities will be better for chemists or anthropologists 10 years from now . That one we would like to know well in advance , in time for our children to make a decision about what they will major in as they get ready to enter college . All of these things would be useful to individuals , and governments and industries might want to know even more . It is to answer questions like these that academic futurologists devised some ingenious methodologies for long-range forecasting . Forecasting Methods I have great respect for the people at the Rand Corporation and Herman Kahn 's old Hudson Institute . Their invention of such procedures as Delphi and scenario writing took a lot of hard work and brainpower . When these methods were new , I liked them well enough to lecture on them , teach them in my course at the University of Kansas , and even experiment with them for myself . But as time passed , these methodologies began to exhibit flaws . Delphi is a procedure in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them for their estimates of when , or if , a long list of technological changes are likely to happen . The panelists are drawn from professionals with a wide range of expertise and are encouraged to comment on the phrasing of the questions , the reasons why they chose one date over another , and anything else that , to them , seems pertinent to the inquiry . When the results are in , questionnaires are reconsidered and specific questions sometimes changed for clarity and answerability . Then , the results of the first poll , plus a revised questionnaire and some of the comments received , are recirculated to the same group . After that , the procedure is then repeated a third time . It turned out that after three rounds a consensus generally began to emerge . More importantly , questions were sharpened and made more answerable . For example , in Rand 's first large-scale use of Delphi in the early 1960s , one question in the first round asked when the respondents anticipated the emergence of computers as intelligent as a human genius . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a useful answer . So , after two revisions , the question came to ask for a date for the development of computers capable of taking and scoring 150 or better on a standard IQ test . If nothing else , that sort of refinement made it possible to improve the definition of terms . Whether the forecasts corresponded to some future reality , however , was another matter entirely . As time passed , and some of the forecasted dates were reached , it turned out that the predictions came closest to success in only a few limited areas , such as the development of the space program . But as in the prediction of an unborn baby 's sex , that was primarily because the events " predicted " had already been put on the schedule and , in many cases , contracts had been drawn up . On the other hand , scenario writing as practiced by Kahn and others utilized a different technique . Kahn 's notion was to write down the things that were very likely to happen very soon , then inspect that near-future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One would proceed step by step to the future , through as many iterations as one liked . That made sense , until it became clear that some of the scenarios had even the first step wrong . One famous scenario dated 1967 began , " In 1968 , the United States won the war in Vietnam . " Well , as many of you remember , it did n't . Still , the rest of that scenario was just about as plausible and accurate as any other . These methodologies , though very good at offering glimpses into what might happen , simply were n't doing the job of saying what would happen . My friend John R. Pierce of Bell Laboratories said at the time that the trouble with the future is that there are so many of them . But when they get here , and become the present , there will only be one . That was also when Dennis Gabor came along with his well-known statement about the future . We might as well give up on trying to predict the future , he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But there was something better we could do instead . We could invent it . Inventing the Future When Gabor pointed out that it was within our power to invent the future , he was proposing what is now called " normative forecasting . " The way to do that is first to describe all the possible future events and circumstances we can think of . In order to take this first step , we may make use of such methods as Delphi , scenario writing , trend-line extrapolation , and whatever else might be of use . We may even wish to include the more-thoughtful works of science fiction . Then , once the possible futures ( or " futuribles , " as Bertrand de Jouvenel called them ) have been identified , we can apply some sort of value judgment to them . We can then try to find ways to attain the futures that look attractive-which is to say , the ones we believe would be good for everyone . The ones that do n't , we can do our best to avoid . In this way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a particular future , it helps to have some way of getting the rest of the world to cooperate . Your work is easiest if you happen to be a U.S. president or a totalitarian dictator . The power of his office is what made it possible for John F. Kennedy to " invent " the American moon landings in the late 1960s . He decreed it , the money was appropriated , the hardware was built , and the landings took place . ( Unfortunately , Kennedy himself was n't around to see them happen , because somebody else had " invented " a different personal future for the president . ) In much the same way , Joseph Stalin " invented " the industrialization of Russia . He took a sprawling agricultural empire and forced it to build heavy industry on a huge scale . That sort of purposeful invention was actually easier for Stalin than for Kennedy , because Stalin did n't have to worry about getting Congress or the courts to go along . He simply told everybody what to do and sent out his strong-arm boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same token , it was a lot tougher on the Russian and other Soviet peoples who had to carry out his decrees . In both cases , such events would no doubt have happened sooner or later anyway . But they happened when they did , and as they did , because Kennedy and Stalin used their power to make them happen . That ability to bring about specific and immediate invention of the future is not available to most of us , simply because we do n't possess that kind of power . But that does not mean we are powerless . Every action of our lives has consequences , and there are a lot of us in the world , performing a lot of actions . Consider some of the individual decisions we make in the course of our lives : to buy or not to buy a new car ; to have a child ; to take early retirement or work on for a few more years ; whether to walk to the corner store or jump in the car ; or whether to turn the thermostat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No single decision would appear as even a blip in the great input-output ledger of the human race . But if millions or even billions of us make the same decision , then things change drastically . The sum of these individual choices is no longer trivial . In fact , it invents a significantly different kind of future for everyone . Finding Out What Needs to Be Done There are , however , some kinds of decisions that need to be taken to a level higher than the individual . Is there any way to identify them so that , for instance , future Congresses will act to make the future better , rather than simply doing their best to secure their own reelection ? There is , I think , a methodology that may at least give us a clue . It comes from the Delphi procedure . In the final section of the sand Corporation 's original Delphi report , there was one group of questions that asked the respondents to rate a list of possible future technologies , both as to their likelihood of occurring and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of such " futuribles " that the respondents generally agreed would be very useful if they could be made to happen , but were , unfortunately , very unlikely to come to pass . It occurred to me that it might be useful to go a little farther in this area , in an attempt to make the forecasting normative . So , with a few others , I tried a few experiments : choosing good , but unlikely , possible future events and technologies ; trying to analyze the factors that made them unlikely ; and , finally , seeking ways to remove or bypass the obstacles . I called the procedure PhiDelph . One question we took up was the future of the Aral Sea . Until a few decades ago , the Aral was one of the largest and most productive of the world 's inland seas , supporting many successful fisheries and industries around its shores . Then , it began to dry up catastrophically . Now , the Aral Sea is only a fraction of its earlier size . The former sea bottom has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dust for miles around . The ruins of seagoing ships stand on dry land , miles from the present shoreline . In short , it is an ecological nightmare . Clearly , it would be desirable to restore the Aral Sea to health . Was it possible to find a way to make that happen ? The reason it dried up was known . An overwhelming proportion of the rivers that fed the Aral Sea had been diverted for irrigation , largely of immense cotton plantations . To restore the Aral Sea to its former state , it would be necessary to stop those excessive withdrawals . But that would have consequences of its own , namely ruin for the millions of people whose livelihoods now depended on such crops as cotton . On the other hand , cotton is a notoriously thirsty crop . There are many other crops that require far less irrigation . Besides that , the irrigation works that drain water meant for the Aral Sea are terribly wasteful . They are composed of ditches that are generally unlined ( losing much water to seepage ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequent considerable evaporation losses ) , and the irrigation waters are applied by rule of thumb instead of by careful analysis of daily needs . A few agronomists from Israel 's Negev region could easily prepare a plan that would reduce such diversion by 50% or more-perhaps by much more if other crops were substituted . Then , the Aral would grow again . Or so the technology savs . But there are other factors to be considered as well . Somewhere , the funding has to be found to rebuild the irrigation . Somehow , the farmers have to be provided with the training and supplies to plant new crops , and markets for them have to be identified and reached . In the present , chaotic state of the region 's economy , that sort of money is not likely to be provided . In any case , the desertification of the Aral region , however appalling in its consequences , ranks a long way from the top of the mosturgent changes needed . One might think that this would be a good place for a Stalin-type tyrant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not likely . It was under such tyranny that the region got into this mess in the first place . So , we have just about reached the end of what Phi-Delph can tell us about the solutions to the Aral Sea problem . What needs to be done is fairly clear . How to get it done depends on how much the people involved want it , what they 're willing to put up with , and how much they 're willing to pay to make it happen . And that turns out to be precisely the same conclusion that we reach in most other attempts to avoid or repair disaster . A Benign World for One 's Children This brings us back to the basic rationale for all our efforts : The only good reason for trying to predict the future in the first place is so that now , in the present , we can try to shape it to our heart 's desire . I would like to see that happen , in spite of the fact that , somewhat to my surprise ( I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years old . This has not dampened my interest in the future , but it has certainly affected my attitudes toward it . Whatever changes the world may face in the approaching twenty-first century , I can view them with fairly detached emotions , since it is not likely I will personally be present to suffer , or enjoy , very many of them . On the other hand , I do have children , my children have children , and it is a good bet that at least some of those grandchildren will themselves start producing future generations over the next decade or two . I would like very much to think that they will have a reasonably benign world to live in . And I even think I know how to bring it about . If we do what we can to anticipate the futuribles of the next few decades , take them seriously , and make the effort to encourage the good ones and avert the bad , then , in spite of all the worrisome problems we can foresee , it may yet come out for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Author Affiliation About the Author Frederik Pohl is best known as the author of such science-fiction books as Gateway , The Voices of Heaven , and The World at the End of Time .
