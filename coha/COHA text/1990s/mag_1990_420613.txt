Section : YOUR TAXES <p> Deliberately and methodically , the Internal Revenue Service stacks the deck against taxpayers in 10 major ways . A few of its methods are merely unfair , like charging a higher rate of interest on back taxes than it pays on late refunds . Others cause honest taxpayers needless misery and even despair , like seizing your assets without notice and leaving you with too little to live on . The Taxpayer Bill of Rights failed to end such abuses . Once you understand what the IRS is up to , however , there are ways you can fight back . This is the third in MONEY 'S ongoing series on the IRS . <p> No police department can do it . And the FBI does n't dare . Yet the Internal Revenue Service does  --  all the time . It presumes that taxpayers are guilty and then , without a court order , it punishes them by garnisheeing paychecks , snatching cash from bank accounts and trashing credit ratings by slapping liens on property and even seizing cars and homes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and passes judgment on them , in clear violation of our system of checks and balances , " wrote an angry MONEY reader in a recent letter to the editor signed " Anonymous IRS Slave . " <p> Few Americans would oppose harsh actions against tax cheats and chronic deadbeats . But when a government agency is so badly run that nearly half of the 36 million notices it sends out each year demanding additional tax or penalties are inaccurate ( MONEY , April ) , and those kinds of blunders can drive a man to take his own life ( MONEY , June ) , a case can be made that its powers are far beyond its ability to control them . Says tax : attorney Robert Spector of IDS Financial Services in Minneapolis : " The IRS believes that they 're the good guys and taxpayers are the bad guys . It amazes me that our voluntary tax system still works despite how the IRS treats taxpayers . " <p> Congress recognized that the IRS was exploiting a basic injustice built into the rules of tax collecting and tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arkansas Democratic Senator David Pryor 's 11,000-word Taxpayer Bill of Rights became law . Yet our reporting in April and June , plus an unending stream of letters from readers complaining about the IRS , indicated that the wrongs persisted . Given all this , we decided to do a scalpel probe to see whether a key provision of the Bill of Rights was being honored . <p> In May and June our correspondents conducted a telephone survey of 156 taxpayers in 15 cities across the country . All had liens placed on their property by the IRS in the past two years because they owed back taxes . Under Taxpayer Rights , the IRS must send a notice by certified mail warning that a lien establishing the government 's priority over other creditors will be filed in court unless the taxpayer pays the amount due within 30 days-4 Yet a full 35% of the taxpayers queried by MONEY claimed they received the 30-day warning . Six never said they first learned that liens had been put on their property when MONEY 'S correspondents , called . Asked to comment on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied : " I 'm sure we miss some taxpayers because we do n't have their proper address or something like that , but I do n't think we miss 35% . " Ellen Murphy , who heads the IRS public affairs office , objected to MONEY 'S survey on the grounds that taxpayers answered anonymously and did not give the agency permission to rebut their claims . The IRS has never done a study on the accuracy of its liens . <p> That unsettling skirmish helped to convince MONEY 'S tax team to take a deeper look at the IRS . Over a four-month period , we interviewed scores of accountants , tax attorneys , tax scholars and current and former IRS employees . What emerged was a consensus on the 10 most : egregious IRS injustices . Since Taxpayer Rights was meant to protect you against several of these practices , we also offer specific advice on what you should demand that Congress do to fix the basic injustice in our tax system . 1 The IRS assesses draconian penalties and interest charges . <p> Life is usually quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Maine where Eugene Swan , 81 , and his wife Katharine , 67 , raise draft horses and make maple syrup . But the peace was shattered in May 1988 when Katharine received a letter from the IRS alleging her failure to report interest and dividends and demanding $9,559 more in income taxes , $10,366.03 in interest and penalties of $9,982.52-$29,907.55 in all . " We were stunned and frightened , " recalls Eugene . <p> Although the Swans ' lawyer promptly sent the IRS proof that Katharine did n't owe a cent , the agency continued to dun her for 15 months until after the Swans had complained to their congresswoman and U.S. senators and incurred $1,549.57 in legal and accounting fees . <p> That 's not the end of the story , however . Last February , the IRS inexplicably sent the Swans a check for $3,562.06 , then instructed them to return it so the amount could be credited against their 1990 tax bill . The puzzled couple complied , but wonder what sort of surprise the IRS will spring on them next . <p> When MONEY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commissioner for collection Keenan replied , in writing : " There is no question that it took too long to resolve this account . However , we believe that technological advances and procedural changes will reduce such problems in the future . " But how about now ? Keenan concluded that the IRS sent the Swans a refund check for $247.71 last August . Yet IRS spokesman Wilson Fadely later said that the agency sent the Swans a $3,562.06 refund last February and another check for $77.36 last May . <p> Cases like the Swans ' , in which interest and penalties dwarf the tax allegedly owed , inspired Congress last December to simplify and eliminate some overlaps among the roughly 150 separate penalties the IRS had the power to impose . The new law applies to tax returns filed after Dec. 31 , 1989 . Unfortunately , it gives precious little relief . Under the new rules , had the IRS been correct , the Swans would still owe $28,231.78 , says senior tax manager Marvin Michelman of Deloitte &; Touche in New York City . <p> The consensus of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Take up penalty reform again and provide real relief this time . One way : reduce the number of penalties that can be assessed against a taxpayer who makes one mistake on his return . <p> Repeal a 1.982 law that allows the IRS to charge compound instead of simple interest . 2 The IRS charges you a higher interest rate on back taxes than it pays you on refunds . <p> This item may seem small , but it epitomizes government contempt for taxpayers that is far from confined to the IRS . Because Congress inserted a particularly ungenerous provision in the Tax Reform Act of 1986 , the interest rate the IRS pays on late refunds ( those made more than 45 days after April 15 ) is equal to the federal short-term rate-that is , the average yield of all outstanding Treasury securities due to mature within three years , plus two percentage points . The rate you pay on back taxes , however , is equal to the fed rate plus three percentage points . <p> What should Congress do ? <p> Equalize the interest rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. District Court or U.S. Claims Court , you must the tax the IRS says you owe . <p> You have four avenues of appeal if you do n't agree with a tax bill , but the two best routes are open by law only if you pay up before you go to court . <p> First of all , you can request a hearing with an IRS appeals officer without paying in advance . Some tax pros , however , question your chance of getting a fair shake there . Says tax attorney Robert Spector : " Appeals officers clearly favor the IRS , which is n't surprising since their paychecks are signed by the Treasury Department . " Retorts IRS appeals division director James J. Casimir : " If we were n't really a separate appeals process , we would not be able to reach agreement with the taxpayer on 90% of the cases that come before us . " After appeals , the IRS actually collects $67.20 of every $100 in additional taxes assessed by its auditors . <p> You can also appeal to the U.S. Tax Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sessions at 77 locations throughout the country , has 42 judges , 20 of whom are former IRS officials . Your chances of winning in Tax Court are slim , though . Last year , the court decided only 4% of 1,268 cases in favor of taxpayers ; it issued split decisions 48% of the time . And whenever the IRS loses in that court , the IRS commissioner has the right to formally agree or disagree with the decision . If he disagrees , taxpayers with similar cases must either conform to the IRS view or spend money litigating issues the court has already decided . <p> Your odds of winning an unconditional victory improve if you pay your disputed tax bill in advance and sue either in U.S. Claims Court or U.S. District Court . Last year the claims court decided 8% of its 73 cases in favor of taxpayers and 3% partly in the government 's and partly in the taxpayer 's favor ; district courts favored taxpayers in 18% of the 455 cases decided and issued split decisions in 40% of all cases . Says tax attorney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former Justice Department lawyer for the IRS : " If a client can afford to pay up front , I usually suggest district court . District courts tend to look for fair results , while the Tax Court focuses on technicalities . I 'd love it if both courts were accessible without paying the tax in advance . " <p> What should Congress do ? <p> Open all four avenues of appeal to taxpayers without forcing them to pay disputed bills in advance . 4 The IRS abuses its powers to seize your paycheck and personal property . <p> Over the past decade , a revenue-ravenous Congress has pressured the IRS to collect more and more money , emboldening the agency to get tougher and tougher with alleged deadbeats . To close 2.1 million delinquent accounts in 1979 , the IRS filed 371,357 liens , levied 465,059 paychecks and bank accounts and seized 5,723 items of personal and real property . Last year , the IRS closed 2.8 million delinquencies , filed 904,000 liens , served 2.3 million levies and made 12,870 seizures . Asked why liens , levies and seizures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the number of delinquent cases closed is up by only 32% , IRS assistant commissioner for collection Keenan replied : " The IRS is a growth business . " In 1979 , each collection division employee filed an average of 46 levies ; now that figure has blitzed to 125 . <p> As MONEY 's survey of recently liened-on taxpayers shows , however , the agency frequently fails to give fair warning before taking ham-handed collection actions . By law , the IRS is supposed to levy paychecks and bank accounts only after a taxpayer fails to respond to five tax-due notices sent at five- to six-week intervals . The final notice , which warns of the IRS ' power to levy . and file liens , is supposed to be sent by certified mail . The IRS can dispense with these warnings in some instances , notably in a so-called jeopardy assessment , if it has reason to believe that you intend to shift assets out of its reach or flee the country . The IRS made only 246 jeopardy assessments last year . <p> Tax-due notices are generated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If a taxpayer fails to respond to the notices , his bank account or paycheck may be levied or a lien may be placed on his property . Intractable cases are assigned to one of 21 Automated Collection System offices across the country or to a revenue officer in one of 63 district offices . <p> Sometimes  --  no one knows exactly how often  --  the IRS seizes assets without warning . Take the case of Penny Steilmacher , 39 , of Keizer , Ore . She was employed as a $25,000-a-year systems auditor for a cable television company when the IRS concluded that she owed $95,426 in back taxes and sent a levy notice to her employer in August 1988 . Before the agency could seize one of her $650 paychecks , however , Stellmacher hired an accountant who asked her employer to stop paying her until the matter was cleared up . Stellmacher and her husband Paul , 32 , then called and wrote to the IRS and were told that Penny owed all those back taxes for 1984 . It took their accountant two weeks to convince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't realized that the Stellmachers had been filing joint tax returns since they married in 1984 , so it dunned Penny at her former address for failing to file individual returns under her maiden name . <p> The Stellmachers were offended even more by the IRS ' arrogance than by its incompetence . Says Paul : " I realize the IRS deals with a lot of people who do n't want to pay their fair share , but most do . They treated us like full-blown criminals . " The Stellmachers refused to sign a waiver allowing the IRS to comment on their case . " Our trust in the IRS has really eroded , " says Paul . <p> Although the Taxpayer Bill of Rights includes a provision meant to head off surprise IRS raids on savings accounts , the law is flawed . Banks and other financial institutions are required to wait 21 days before releasing money from customers ' accounts to the agency . But IRS Commissioner Goldberg told Congress last April that some banks were not waiting 21 days before handing money from customers ' accounts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would prevent banks from ignoring the 21-day safeguard . <p> What should Congress do ? <p> Prohibit IRS service center employees from imposing liens and levies unless one of them personally talks to a taxpayer and determines that no other recourse is possible . The IRS ' Keenan says he would n't object to such a move , but adds : " We have to run the IRS as a business , and we have to look at the costs we incur to collect delinquent taxes . " 5 When the IRS seizes your assets , it can leave you with too little to live on . <p> The Taxpayer Bill of Rights tried to solve this problem ; characteristically , it did n't go far enough . The law exempts from seizure wages equal to your standard deduction and personal exemptions divided by 52 . That formula leaves a family of four only $258 a week , up from $150 prior to 1988 . C.P.A. and tax attorney Alan Zipp of Rockville , Md. argues that 's still too punitive . " People run into tax problems because they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters worse , " he says . " I 've seen people turn to illegal activities just to pay their taxes . " <p> Harsher still is the law 's provision that empowers the IRS to strip you of all but $1,650 in personal belongings and $1,100 in business property . Those limits were $1,500 and $1,000 , respectively , before the Taxpayer Bill of Rights came limping to the rescue . <p> What should Congress do ? <p> Peg the portion of a taxpayer 's paycheck that is exempt from levy to the cost of living in his area and raise the exemptions for personal and business property to $5,000 each . 6 Revenue officers have too much individual discretion . <p> Although the Internal Revenue Manual runs to 260 densely printed volumes , tax collectors enjoy tremendous latitude , partly because courts have ruled over the years that the manual is not the law . As a result , the IRS can flaunt its own rules with impunity . Says Jack Warren Wade Jr. , a former IRS revenue officer and author of When You Owe the IRS ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collection employees or even supervisors are going to work the same case the same way . Abusive activity occurs because of the exercise of this discretion . " <p> The Taxpayer Bill of Rights , for example , requires that the IRS merely consider allowing you to pay back taxes in installments . So your ability to negotiate such a deal depends on the IRS employee who 's assigned to your case . When the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants polled C.P.A.s last year , only 28% said that employees at IRS Automated Collection System offices were always or usually consistent in applying installment payment agreements in similar situations ; 42% said that revenue officers in district offices were always or usually consistent . <p> David Carroll , 53 , a retailer of western-style clothing , was never given the option of paying $20,601.86 in overdue self-employment taxes , interest and penalties in installments . Instead , revenue officer Leo Andersen surprised Carroll at his Phoenix home one morning in July 1989 and demanded full payment . The men engaged in a shouting match , and Andersen left empty-handed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threatening a federal officer and faced up to eight years in prison and a $ 100,000 fine . After hearing testimony last February , a federal judge acquitted Carroll , who had since paid his back taxes . The judge concluded that the 260-pound Andersen and the 220-pound Carroll had merely bumped bellies while bellowing at each other . Says Carroll of Andersen 's tactics : " He 's a bully . " In a letter to MONEY , IRS assistant ' commissioner Keenan said that Andersen testified at trial that although he felt he had been intimidated , he never believed that Carroll 's actions put him in danger . <p> Like Carroll , Brenda Stout , 47 , had the misfortune of drawing an overzealous revenue officer on her case . Between September 1988 and May 1989 , Sherilyn Heyward of the IRS ' Savannah office originally told Stout that she owed $51,821.58  --  then $7,000 more , then $1,009 more , and finally $37,093.76 more  --  in back taxes on diesel fuel that she sold at her Garden City , Ga . gas station and convenience store . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid the additional $8,009 and negotiated to pay the remaining $37,093.76 in weekly installments . After paying most of it but missing several payments , Stout told Heyward last December that she planned to sell her store to pay the remaining $7,532.95 . <p> Heyward then attempted to levy Stout 's business bank account , but the bank refused to turn over the money because the levy notice showed an incorrect address for Stout . Without any further investigation , Heyward petitioned the U.S. District Court in Savannah to permit the IRS to raid Stout 's store , arguing incorrectly that Stout had switched bank accounts to put her assets out of the government 's reach . After Judge B. Avant Edenfield granted Heyward 's request last May , the agent and five other revenue officers , two armed with guns , burst into Stout 's store , searched cash registers and desk drawers and seized more than $1,600 in cash and checks , including $75 that belonged to a woman who sold puppets on consignment in the store . Stout complained to Judge Edenfield , who last June removed Heyward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characterized the episode as " a story of bureaucratic incompetence , aggravated by arrogance and hostility toward those the bureaucracy was intended to serve . " <p> The IRS got to keep the money it seized , however . Indeed , even Stout 's small triumph was fleeting . Within a week of the judge 's order , she received a letter from the IRS demanding yet another $2,600 . When she called the agency , she learned that Heyward had been named acting collection group manager while her boss was away on an eight-day leave . <p> The IRS ' Keenan wrote to MONEY : " Our review shows that during the course of this matter we took actions based on judgments that subsequently turned out to be incorrect ... While I fully believe that IRS employees did not violate the law or the letter of our policies in discharging their responsibilities , these incidents obviously caused her distress and inconvenience and I do offer our apologies . " <p> Keenan 's mild rebuke to Heyward underscores another disturbing point that former and current revenue officers made in interviews with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employee for being tot ) soft on taxpayers than too harsh . Says revenue officer John Connor of the IRS ' Philadelphia office : " You 're never going to get into trouble with the IRS for taking enforcement action . You 're going to get in trouble for not doing it . " IRS public affairs chief Ellen Murphy responded that the agency had received 67 allegations of employee abuse of power from Oct. 1 , 1989 to Aug. 4 , 1990 . Eleven of those cases were closed because the charges could not be supported . Fifteen cases are still pending . In the remaining 41 cases , four employees were fired , 14 were suspended , 12 were reprimanded and 11 resigned when they were confronted with charges of misconduct . <p> Also , in defense of the IRS ' collection practices , Murphy offered a February 1990 survey by the consulting firm Booz Allen &; Hamilton of 2,070 taxpayers dunned by the agency 's collection division . Those results , however , suggest that the IRS has little reason to be self-satisfied . For example , 30% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt they had been treated unfairly , 43% said they had been treated fairly and the rest reported mixed feelings . Service centers had the best record : 51% of the taxpayers who had dealt with these offices said they had been treated fairly and only 19% cited unfair treatment . Especially disturbing : about half of all taxpayers surveyed felt the IRS did little to help them understand their rights . <p> What should Congress do ? <p> Require the IRS to write regulations for collection procedures so a taxpayer 's treatment does not depend on the independent judgment of the collection agent assigned to his case . <p> Make installment payment plans mandatory for taxpayers who owe less than , say , $2,500 and have an unblemished record of tax compliance . <p> 7 Once the IRS unleashes its collection hounds , they 're virtually unstoppable . Few taxpayers have ever heard of the Anti-Injunction Act of 1924 . Too bad . This law so limits your ability to file a lawsuit to restrain the assessment or collection of taxes that David Keating , executive vice president of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of taxpayers ' rights . " Likewise , over the years courts have been very stingy with injunctions , granting them only if taxpayers could prove that they were in danger of suffering irreparable damages and that the government would not win the case under any circumstances . <p> The upshot : taxpayers must appeal for mercy to the hangman himself , the IRS . Tile Taxpayer Bill of Rights formalized a procedure for asking the IRS to halt collection actions , but it 's questionable whether the program has brought relief to many people . The law gives the IRS ' problem resolution officers the authority to issue so-called Taxpayer Assistance Orders ( TAOs ) to stop collection procedures if a taxpayer can show that he or she will suffer a significant hardship . So far , TAOs , have been harder to come by than crosses at a vampires ' convention . Since the rules took effect on Jan. 1 , 1989 to last May , the IRS received 23,081 applications for TAOs  --  and issued 10 . One reason for the scarcity : the stony-hearted definition of hardship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1989 . For instance , financial pain alone is not reason enough to grant a TAO . The action the IRS takes against you must also " offend the sense of fairness of taxpayers in general . " <p> IRS taxpayer ombudsman Damon O. Holmes , who supervises the agency 's problem resolution officers , defends the program by pointing out that the problems of around one-third of the taxpayers the IRS confirmed were hardship cases were resolved without issuing such an order . <p> What should Congress do ? <p> Amend the Anti-Injunction Act to allow citizens to file lawsuits in federal court to halt IRS collection actions under more circumstances . A notable instance : when the agency makes an improper or illegal tax assessment or violates laws or regulations that provide procedural safeguards designed to protect taxpayers . <p> Hold hearings on the TAO program to determine whether it really works or merely serves as window dressing . <p> 8 Taxpayers who have suffered financially through IRS carelessness can not sue for damages . Until the Taxpayer Bill of Rights became law , citizens could n't sue the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But even now , suits are permitted only if an IRS employee " recklessly or intentionally " disregards tax laws or regulations . Problem is , recklessness is far harder to prove than carelessness . In addition , the law forces you to exhaust all administrative remedies within the IRS before you sue and limits your compensation to the lesser of $1.00,000 or the actual and direct economic damages you suffered plus the cost of your lawsuit . <p> What should Congress do ? <p> Give taxpayers the right to sue in federal district court if an IRS employee 's carelessness harms them financially . 9 Even if you beat the IRS in court , you wo n't be able to recover most of your legal fees . <p> Thanks to the 1986 tax reform law , the most you can collect is $75 an hour , though tax attorneys generally charge $175 or more . You can petition the court to award higher fees , but judges rarely do that because of the law . <p> What should Congress do ? <p> Eliminate the $75-an-hour limit and instead let judges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burden of proof if the IRS hits you with the 100% penalty . The IRS wields this lavish levy when it can not collect income and Social Security taxes withheld by an employer from workers ' paychecks . By law , the agency may assess penalties in the same amount as the withheld taxes on anyone responsible for paying these taxes . If a revenue officer can not determine who is responsible , he is instructed by the Internal Revenue Manual to look to the company 's president , secretary and treasurer . Critics charge , however , that , revenue officers often slap the 11 ) 0% penalty on bookkeepers , accountants , shareholders and even business owners ' spouses . Says David Silverman , author of Battling the IRS ( Circle City Press , $14.95 ) : " Anyone who could sign a check is considered responsible for paying taxes , and it 's up to them to prove otherwise . " <p> What should Congress do ? <p> Change the law to restrict the IRS to using the 100% penalty only against corporate officers and directors . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a full set of teeth . Colorado Republican Senator Bill Armstrong raised hopes recently when he charged that the 1988 Bill of Rights " is not living up to its name " and introduced five bills to strengthen it  --  including one that would facilitate suing the IRS and recovering costs . But none of these measures has much chance of passing soon , particularly since Senator Armstrong is not running for re-election . Indeed , Congress is pressing the IRS anew to fatten its collections . <p> Ultimately in a democracy , taxpayers get all the rights they are willing to fight for . So you must first stand up , shout that you are mad and vow that you are n't going to take it anymore . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Brenda Stout turned to her husband Alan for comfort after an armed IRS raid on her store ; a court called the case of of " incompetence aggravated by arrogance and hostility .
