<p> If a computer glitch kept thousands of customers unsatisfied , would n't any company be embarrassed ? <p> Not E*Trade , the brash Internet stock brokerage company . Indeed , it ended its shareholder meeting last week with an elaborate video montage of the news coverage of its three days of trading halts in February . While Christos M. Cotsakos , the company 's chief executive , acknowledged that E*Trade had to prevent such problems from recurring , he used the video mainly as a rousing affirmation of E*Trade 's coverage in virtually every media , " Mr. Cotsakos said in an interview last week . " The degree to which we have been recognized as a leader in this space is unequaled . And that is something we should be very proud of . " <p> That is typical bravado from Mr. Cotsakos , who likes to say he is not simply running a company but rather leading a " revolution that is turning into a movement " as on-line trading grows to account for one in every seven stock trades in the country . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stock exchange to the shopping mall and the television station . E*Trade , he said , is becoming a " digital financial media company " that will offer financial transactions , information , advertising and electronic shopping over the Internet , cable television and even wireless hand-held devices . <p> In effect , he wants to marry the media aspirations of Internet portals like Yahoo with the dream of building a financial supermarket . Oh , yes , Mr. Cotsakos also wants E*Trade to foment this movement in more than 30 countries . <p> Yet by fighting on so many fronts , Mr. Cotsakos risks giving up the ground that E*Trade has already won in the brokerage business , where competition from Charles Schwab , Fidelity and Merrill Lynch is growing more intense . He has even sacrificed E*Trade 's position as one of the few profitable Internet companies in order to spend as much as $150 million on an extravagant marketing blitz meant to attract a million new customers the next year . <p> " Christos has the most expansive vision of what an on-line trading company can become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suisse First Boston . " But that kind of aggressive attitude , being willing to try stuff that other people do n't think is completely baked , is a double-edged sword . They could be throwing money down a black hole . " <p> Investors certainly found the timing of the marketing plan half-baked . It was announced last summer just as a market slump raised fears that volume at stockbrokers would dry up . E*Trade 's shares fell to $6 in October , adjusted for a recent 2-for-1 split , from $17.25 in August . <p> Mr. Cotsakos readily acknowledges he has had some selling to do , but that is what he is good at . <p> " If you are making money , how do you convince shareholders that by losing money you will increase value in the long run ? " Mr. Cotsakos asked in an earlier interview . " With absolute , sheer fundamentalist dedication , I said the only way we would be successful was to take big bold risks and to move very quickly . " <p> Now the company 's stock has bounced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive return on the marketing campaign . The shares closed yesterday at $54.125 , giving E*Trade a market value of $6.2 billion  --  now larger than that of Paine Webber , a more conventional brokerage firm . Perhaps more important , investors have come to realize that Mr. Cotsakos 's plan to lose lots of money to finance rapid growth resembles the strategy of highly valued Internet companies like Amazon.com . <p> " Christos has turned E*Trade from a brokerage play to an Internet play , " noted Julio Gomez , who runs a consulting firm focused on electronic trading . <p> Not all investors are convinced . <p> " Christos rubs institutional investors one of two ways , " Mr. Burnham , the First Boston analyst , said . " Some are caught up in the vision . Others are turned off and say he 's a self-promoter who does n't know anything about the blocking and tackling of the brokerage business . " <p> Still , even some competitors acknowledge that so far E*Trade has been able to deliver on most of its grandiose promises . <p> " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they have run forward to catch it every time , " said the head of a major on-line brokerage operation who spoke on the condition of anonymity . <p> When Mr. Cotsakos , who is 50 , joined E*Trade just before its initial public offering in 1996 , he knew nothing of Wall Street . But he brought a passionate leadership style , built on his experience as an Army squad leader in Vietnam and honed by his failure to make it as an actor . <p> After his acting career stumbled , he signed on as a $3-an-hour package handler at Federal Express . He worked his way up rapidly and was assigned to run the company 's operations in Continental Europe in 1988 . <p> In 1992 , he was hired to run the European operations of A. C. Nielsen , the big market research company . He rose to become president but left the company just before its owner , Dun &; Bradstreet , took it public . <p> " Nielsen was not successful when Cotsakos was there , " said James D. Dougherty , an analyst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He banked all the company 's future on whiz-bang silver-bullet software that just never worked . " ( Mr. Cotsakos said Dun &; Bradstreet would not invest the money needed to realize his plans . ) <p> At E*Trade Group , based in Palo Alto , Calif. , Mr. Cotsakso draws from both his military and theatrical experience to practice what one employee calls " management by revival meeting . " He eschews formal meetings for what he calls " swarms , " more informal sessions in which employees buzz briefly about dealing with a problem . And he will surprise his executives with sudden changes in strategy , such as replacing E*Trade 's somber gold-and-black logo last year with a hip and decidedly unfinancial green and purple model . <p> " He will take your breath away , " said Lisa Nash , a vice president for marketing . " That 's part of his management style . " <p> Mr. Cotsakos hired a management team drawn largely from outside financial services , and it has brought some unconventional ideas . Debra J. Chrapaty , who was recruited from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on a network of dozens of small work station computers  --  unusual in finance services , which typically relies on mainframes to keep customer data secure . <p> The company 's marketing is in the hands of Jerry Gramaglia , who was recruited from Sprint . Last week , he hired Omnicom Group 's Goodby , Silverstein &; Partners , the advertising agency that produced the " Got milk ? " campaign , to create a successor to E*Trade 's long-running " Someday we 'll all invest this way " campaign . <p> That campaign began when E*Trade 's standard $20 commission level , now as low $14.95 for some stocks , differentiated it from its more expensive competitors . But now competitors like Fidelity and Schwab have lowered their prices . And deep discounters have emerged , like Datek and Ameritrade , with commissions under $10 . <p> Full-service firms like Morgan Stanley Dean Witter , Donaldson , Lufkin &; Jenrette and Merrill Lynch , meanwhile , are offering research and advice along with on-line trading . And Schwab , which has become the leading on-line broker despite $30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand-holding to lure customers from firms like Merrill . <p> E*Trade does not fear being caught in the middle as the leader in neither price nor service . <p> " Schwab 's position is that most people who come on line are clueless and need a broker as a security blanket , " Mr. Gramaglia said . " That is not whom we target . We believe that most customers are smart enough and capable enough to control their own investments once we give them the same tools that brokers have . " <p> An expanded tool kit is the centerpiece of the company 's expensive new strategy : Destination E*Trade . It has refashioned its Internet site to offer casual visitors as well as customers all sorts of up-to-the-minute information , research , bulletin boards and other investing tools , at a cost to E*Trade of several dollars a month for each " member . " It is modeled on the popular finance channels of Yahoo and the other portals , where E*Trade was advertising at ever increasing prices . <p> " We were being held hostage to someone else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was getting very costly if you did n't own your own distribution . " <p> The results from E*Trade 's refurbished Web site have so far been mixed . In the last three months of 1998 , E*Trade spent $41 million in marketing , including the cost of the site , TV commercials and inducements like $50 rebates for people who opened accounts . That has brought in 500,000 members and 97,000 new brokerage accounts ( excluding the low-margin corporate options business ) , according to Mr. Burnham , the First Boston analyst . <p> That works out to a cost of $404 to lure each new core brokerage account . Since Mr. Burnham estimates that the average account will produce only $526 in profits over the life of the customer , E*Trade may have little to show for its efforts . <p> E*Trade , however , says it can make two or three times that by finding other ways to profit from an affluent customer base . It will expand its own site with banking , mutual funds and other services . And it will sell advertising and generate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So far , the move into advertising has been disappointing , Mr. Cotsakos acknowledges , bringing in less than $200,000 in the most recent quarter . But he argues that ad revenue will grow quickly , now that the company has expanded its sales force . <p> Mr. Cotsakos also wants to offer a greater range of products to corporations and institutions . The company has invested in E-Offering , an investment bank backed by Sanford Robertson , to compete with Wall Street investment bankers in initial public offerings . And it plans to attract big institutional investors with a service combining electronic stock trading with the sort of data provided by Reuters and Bloomberg . <p> E*Trade has also franchised its name and its systems for use by brokerage firms in 33 countries . Currently , its affiliates have opened in Canada and Australia . The company expects Britain , Japan and a few others to follow this year . <p> It took six months and a revived but still wobbly market in Internet stocks for E*Trade to regain the confidence of investors . But Mr. Cotsakos promises even more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , " he said . It will start a new " asterisk channel " after E*Trade 's logo that will be a combination of CNBC and a sort of financial home shopping network . <p> " To me , the game from here is about interactive multimedia , " he said . " It 's not the Internet . It 's how you take the convergence of video , voice and data on wireless phones , computers and television to give people what they want . " <p> For E*Trade , however , to be any more than an asterisk in the history of finance , investors and analysts say it will also have to pay attention to the basics , making sure that last month 's computer problems do not happen regularly again . <p> " I 'm impressed by the breadth of stuff they are talking about doing , " Mr. Burnham said , " but I hope that someone remembers to complete the trades .
