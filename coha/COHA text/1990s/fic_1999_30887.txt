Time grows short at the end of a century , like winter days when night falls too soon . In the dusk , angels and demons walk . Who knows who they are ? Or which is which . But there they are , sneaking their gifts into the crevices of change . Even in a place like Blaszka , less than a dot on the map of Russian-occupied Poland . Someone might say that so-and-so is an angel or so-and-so a demon . But make no mistake , it 's just a question of style . One sympathizes , the other provokes . But their mission is the same , and so is their destination . It 's a cold day , the short Friday of winter , the 20th of Tevet 5654 , or you might call it the 29th of December 1893 , according to the Christian calendar . Everyone 's in a rush , anxious to finish their business before the sun sets . Once darkness falls , the Sabbath rules . Candlelight will have no other purpose than its beauty , and women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Listen . You can hear the excitement in the village square . " Fresh , hot , only two kopecks . " Girls run through the crowd , carrying baskets of rolls , pretzels , pierogies , and herring cut into small rings . The herrings almost speak . Take your pick , the large smelly ones , horse herring , pickled , smoked , or packed in fat . Steam rises from the warm baskets in the winter air . The square smells of vinegar , yeast , and horse dung . Men and women blow into their cold hands to warm them , pinching this and sniffing that , bargaining as if for their souls , undeterred by the crash of a stall that collapses under its mountain of earthenware . This is what keeps Blaszka together , the flimsy stalls piled high with everything , where people lean toward each other , bargaining , touchingwhat they need , shaking it , holding it up to the light . Hurry , the villagers say , the Sabbath is coming . Everything has to close early today . Am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I know that you , lady , will give it to me later , that you will pay . Look at this , straight from Plotsk , the best quality . A pity it should lie here , unused . Let me put it into your basket for you . Just a few kopecks . It costs less than air . Fifty Jewish families and six Polish tenant farmers live in the village . But on market day , every Tuesday and Friday , dozens of Christian peasants , who farm the land along the Plnocna River , come down to Blaszka . In the village square they bargain and in Perlmutter 's tavern , they drink vodka with beer and eat cheese and pickles and hard-boiled eggs . A Jew can never be a peasant , even if he looks and acts like one , nor a gentleman either . Such categories apply only to Christians in Poland , each of them having a place on the land . But by law the Jews are townspeople . Even if they are farmers , they are townspeople borrowing the land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towns the Jews can make their own distinctions , so long as they service the people of the land . So in Blaszka , Jews buy the peasants ' produce and sell goods from Plotsk . Jews are tinsmiths and blacksmiths and cobblers and tailors and wheelwrights and barrelmakers and butchers and bakers . They speak Yiddish and Polish and a smattering of Russian , on weekdays they bargain and on the Sabbath they rest . The village square is n't paved . It 's marked in one corner by the bridge , in another corner by the tavern , by the synagogue in the third corner , and where the square dips down toward the Plnocna River , by the house of Misha the midwife . Her house stands on stilts so that the spring floods flow under it , bringing a rich mud that makes the vegetables in her garden grow larger than anywhere else . If you stood on the doorstep of Misha 's house , you could see the entire village , the river curling around it , the woods behind the river , the lanes leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each with an eating room in front and sleeping rooms behind separated by a halfway where the hens roost in the winter . Across the river , in the new part of Blaszka , you could see the ruins of the mill and the woods overgrowing abandoned houses . There is a legend about the Plnonca River . It 's said that a saint was martyred in the river 's waters at midnight , resulting in the conversion and baptism of the local tribe . Plnoc in Polish means midnight , and so the river was named . But others argue that plnoc also means north , the Plnonca so named because it enters the Vistula River from the north . The Plnonca is frozen now , children sliding on its surface . In front of her house , Misha stands beside her stall , her hands on her hips . She 's bigger than any man in Blaszka . Her table is crowded with jars and bottles , powders and ointments and liquids for women 's troubles , and men 's , too . " There 's nothing to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the women say , but you 'd better watch your behind or the Evil One will send someone to kick it while you 're not paying attention . " Well , let him just try to make some business with me . " Misha holds out her hand , beckoning the invisible stranger . She grins , her gold tooth flashing in the thin winter light . " Do n't worry , " Misha says , " if someone comes from the other side , he 'll soon be running out of Blaszka with his tail between his legs . You can be sure of it . " In a small house off the village square , an old woman is teaching the little girls their letters . Tell us about Misha , they beg . We want to hear the story about Misha and Manya again . Please , please . The old woman puts down her pencil . " Well , I knew Misha 's mother very well . She was so happy when she had a daughter , but she had one fear . Do you know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That her daughter would turn out like Manya . You 've heard of Manya , have n't you ? " Yes , yes , the little girls say , Manya the witch comes in the night to steal away wicked children . " But you 're not wicked children , are you ? " The girls shake their heads , no , no , no . " Now , listen carefully , children . Before Misha , there was Blema , her mother . Before Blema was Miriam , Misha 's grandmother . And before Miriam was ? " Who ? the children ask . " Manya ! " The old woman leans forward , wriggling her clawed fingers at the children until they squeal . " Oh , Manya was bigger than any man , and no one could tame her until they put her to death for casting spells . Blema was afraid that her baby should turn out like Manya , God forbid . So Blema named her baby Miriam after her own mother , who was a good woman . Modest and quiet . Like you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , children . " Blema carried her baby in a shawl on her back when she went to the peasants ' cottages . The peasants liked to play with the little one . They called her Marisha , you know that 's Polish for Miriam . But the baby could n't say Marisha or even Miriam . What came out was Misha . The peasants said it must be her true name , and that , since misha means bear in Polish , the girl would grow up to be as dangerous as a mother bear . And because Misha is a man 's name among the Russians , she would also be as fierce as a Cossack . This is what came to be . I 'm sure you heard your mothers say so . When a woman is in childbirth , even the Angel of Death is afraid of Misha . " In the village square , the watercarrier rushes by Misha 's stall , his buckets swinging wildly on their yoke . As his foot knocks against a stone , he stumbles , holding onto her table for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Across the bridge is what used to be the wealthy part of Blaszka . There among the ruins of abandoned houses , you can see the village well and beside it the bathhouse with its marble columns , built with the miller 's money , may he rest in peace . Beside it is the foundation of the new synagogue , never finished . Inside the bathhouse , the old men sit naked on the benches , sweating in the steam that rises as the attendant pours water over the hot stones . At the end of the room is the sunken bath , the mikva , with its purifying water . Before the men leave , they 'll dip in the mikva to make themselves ready for the Sabbath . Why does the butcher get to sit in the second row of the synagogue so close to the Holy Ark ? they complain . He 's just a proster , a plain person , like us . A man should know his place . The proster do the work , the baalebatim make the money , and the shayner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich enough or they 're scholars . Sure , that 's how it is in most places , but you ca n't expect it here in Blaszka . Who would sit in the second row if not the butcher ? In the days before the Russians blew up the mill , we had shayner in Blaszka . Fine people . But now ? There 's just proster . Anybody who was anybody left Blaszka . And why not ? You can walk for two hours down the road and you 're in Plotsk . The capital of the gubernia . Twenty-six thousand people . A theater . A Jewish hospital . Schools . Everything . Tell me , what 's a town when there 's no fine people driving around in their carriages and telling you what 's what ? That 's the kind of village Blaszka is . We have a rabbi whose greatest friends are unbelievers I saw him get a letter from France myself and he ca n't stand the sight of a lit match , either . Never mind . It 's good to be alive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to eat on Shabbas , it 's all right . I 'm old , but I 'm in no rush to leave . Tell me , if it 's so good there in the next world , why does n't anyone come back to tell us about it ? Outside the bathhouse , a lane leads to the bridge and across the bridge , the road from Blaszka leaves the village square , following the Plnocna River down to the Vistula where it meets the highway that runs from Plotsk to Warsaw . Here , at the juncture of the Vistula and the Plnocna Rivers , there is a shiny black carriage with THE GOLEM PLAYERS painted in yellow on the side . The horse snorts , flicking her tail , braided with a yellow ribbon . Crystals of breath have formed around her mouth , and the creature licks them off with her thirsty tongue . The Director , in his top hat , sits aloft , puffing on his mahogany pipe , horns of smoke curling upward . He looks sideways at the landscape , the bare trees striped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flat land . An open , unremarkable landscape . The Director 's new partner is walking toward him , carrying a bag with rope handles a young and very earnest sort of person , the Traveler . The Director smooths his copper mustache and waves . The Traveler 's hair sticks up like rooster feathers . He wears a ragged black jacket with a drooping rose pinned to the lapel . His thin nose is crooked , bending a little to the left . The Traveler climbs up beside the Director . Sighing , he tears a strip of paper from The Israelite , and lines his cracked boot with the headline , " December 29 , 1893 : More Refugees Fleeing from the East . " While the Director relights his pipe , the younger man leafs through a notebook . The notes are in a small , meticulous script that shines as if the ink were made of a green florescence . " So many people hurt and lonely , talents going to waste , " the Traveler says , his voice hoarse with sympathy . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be a mistake . We ca n't be expected to waste time on an animal like that . " The Traveler stabs the notebook with his finger . " You have your orders and the fellow is on his way , " the Director says , pointing to an approaching cart . The driver is a large man in a fur coat who is whipping his horse till she bleeds while he gnaws on a hunk of salami . The Traveler shields his eyes with his hands , gazing up the road . " I 'd just like to have a choice . Is that too much to ask ? " " It 's the price you pay , my boy . You knew that when you came on board . " The Director rubs the bowl of his pipe against his velvet vest . " You could resign . But then it 's rebirth for you . You interested ? I see not . You serious types are all the same . " He draws an imaginary bow across an even more imaginary violin that nevertheless plays the opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died of cholera . The Traveler looks from his notebook to the absent violin . He is impressed . " It 's nothing , my friend , " the Director says . " Anyone can do it . Even you . " " What 's the trick ? " the Traveler asks , looking around for a hidden music box . " Nothing at all . Just a bit of magic . " " Magic , " the Traveler says thoughtfully , studying his notebook again . " Do n't get any ideas . Let me tell you the facts . What 's magic ? A piece of chocolate . An almond torte . Delicious , and then it melts away . But all of this , the Director says waving his hand grandly , " is something else entirely . Open your eyes and look . Maybe you 'll learn a secret or two . But you ca n't just sit there moping and letting the snow soak through the holes in your boots . No . You 've got to look closely and pay attention . Then you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a door . And who knows , " he winks , " what you might find in there ? Well , my friend , I ca n't sit here and talk all day . I have something to deliver in Blaszka . Would you like to join me ? " " No . I 'd better wait here . You go on . " The Traveler dismounts from the carriage , seating himself on a snowy log . " Au revoir , " the Director says . He picks up the reins and clucks to his fine black horse . The Traveler pulls up the collar of his jacket as the snow trickles down his neck . " Have to get assigned here in the middle of winter , " he grumbles . " Could n't be Warsaw . Streetcars . Electricity . Unions . Oh , no . It 's got to be where people still believe in witchcraft . " He shakes his head . " They do n't know what 's coming to them . " Studying his notebook , he taps his chin . " Could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He looks down the road toward Warsaw , as if he can see the next century riding the train , trailing a line of smoke , the whistle blowing . Time is a trickster in Poland . In Warsaw they have electric lights . On the farms , peasants make their own candles . And in Blaszka ? There , time juggles fire , throwing off sparks that reach far into the past and spin toward the future . But shh , we ca n't talk , now . The story is about to start .
