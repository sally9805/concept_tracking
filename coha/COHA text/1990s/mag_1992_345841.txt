For American sports-car buffs , the past 30 years has been one long slide into the molasses of 55-m.p.h. speed limits , fuel-economy ratings and safety requirements . They lived on memories of cars like the Shelby Cobra , the Ford muscle car that put American hot rodders on the map in 1965 when it blew past Ferraris and Porsches to win the World Manufacturing Championship . <P> Next month , Chrysler takes a step back in time with the 400-h.p . Dodge Viper RT/10 , a performance machine that has sports-car fans salivating even before the limited-edition coupe hits the streets ( only 300 will be produced this year ) . The Viper grew from a 1989 challenge issued by Chrysler president Bob Lutz to design chief Tom Gale and engineering director Francois Castaing : develop a classic sports car that could match the machines of old . Legendary Cobra designer Carroll Shelby , now a Chrysler consultant , was brought in to be " the conscience " of the Viper . " We set out to make a car that was just as brutal as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made it even better . " <P> Whether it will be as successful remains to be seen . But the profile and power of the Viper are outright provocative . Made only in bright red with curves and scoops that echo past roadsters , the Viper reeks of speed . Underneath the hood is Chrysler 's most powerful engine , an eight-liter V-10 that can explode from 0 to 60 m.p.h. in 4.5 sec . While some environmentalists argue that the car is an energy hog , its overall performance has impressed auto enthusiasts . " The Viper makes your lips curl , and your eyes bulge with the terror of taking such a beast to the edge , " gushes Guide to Muscle Cars magazine . <P> The Viper team 's back-to-basics approach left extras like air conditioning and four-wheel steering to softer cars . " We did n't want any of that junk in it , " explains Shelby , a straight-talking visionary . " This is a simple 1960s American muscle car with 1990s technology , " he says . <P> Also a 1990s price tag : $50,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Acura NSX and Ferrari . But for red-blooded Americans who dream of empty roads and police in innocent Chevys , the homegrown Viper is likely to be more a matter of pure lust .
