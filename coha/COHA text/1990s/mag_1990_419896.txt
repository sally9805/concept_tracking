<p> Just because a businesswoman is expecting a baby does n't mean she ca n't look professional while dressing for comfort . <p> It 's 6:00 on a rainy Tuesday morning . Edith Cooper Taylor , vice president of Global Markets at Bankers ' Trust Co. in New York City , is about to begin her day . She knows that halfway around the world the wheels are already in motion , with shifts in the stock market that will affect her business that day , and she 's gearing up for the tasks that await her . At 7:00 a.m. , she heads for the subway , stopping to pick up The New York Times on her way . While the train speeds her toward Wall Street , she checks the business section of the paper , looking for indicators of what the market will do that day . At 7:30 a.m. , she arrives at her office and immediately puts in a call to London to check the market there . <p> This is the beginning of a normal 12-hour work day for Taylor-and for many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like her counterparts in money management positions around the world . She has a keen interest in the stock market , is privy to the inner workings of a business that is baffling to many , and she works to bring in hundreds of thousands of dollars annually for her company . Where Cooper Taylor differs , however , is that she 's a black female who is eight months pregnant . As more working women try to combine their professional careers with motherhood , maintaining a professional look in a working maternity wardrobe is key to preserving an expectant executive 's image . " Although I 'm thrilled to be entering a new phase ' in my personal development , business is still business , " Cooper Taylor says . " I still want to deal with people on a professional level when I 'm working . " Looking Good ... <p> But what do professional women wear during pregnancy to project a " strictly business " attitude when maternity shops , for the most part , are overflowing with bows , big collars and not much else ? They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a highly visible position when I 'm on the trading floor , " says Cooper Taylor . " I want to look outwardly as professional as I always have . It is important to me that I not be treated differently in work-related areas simply because I am pregnant . " <p> Cooper Taylor says she did n't find much in maternity stores that she thought was appropriate . So , for several months she made do with clothing she already owned by removing belts and wearing garments that were loosely structured . When the time finally came to buy maternity clothes , she shopped very carefully . " There are n't very many options available , " she admits . " But by checking all the maternity stores in my area I was able to find pieces that suited my needs . " As her pregnancy progresses , Taylor says she looks for transitional clothing she can wear during her pregnancy that she also will be able to wear while getting back in shape after her baby is born in August . " Since most women are pregnant for at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel it 's wise to buy fabrics that can be worn year around , except on the very hottest or coldest of days . As I 've gotten bigger I have invested in two or three cotton dresses and I think the natural fibers will make me feel cooler and more comfortable as I get into my final few weeks . " <p> Realtor Venetia Coates , president and co-owner of Fidelity Land Title , a title insurance company in St. Louis , says she approached her pregnancy in much the same way she approaches other important aspects of her life . " I took a very practical look at what I needed to do for myself while I was carrying my baby , " says Coates . " I knew that my position here and at my other business ( she also owns a real estate company ) required that I look business-like at all times . But it just did n't make much sense to me to spend a lot of money on clothing I would only be able to wear for a short period of time . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sizes rather than shopping at maternity boutiques . " I went to stores catering to large-size women , " she explains , " and there I found pieces that were just as workable for my expanding body as what the maternity shops carried ( elastic waistbands , longer/fuller tops , unconstructed jackets , flowing dresses ) , but at prices I felt better about paying . " <p> Olivia Moorehead-Slaughter , a clinical psychologist for the Boston Juvenile Court Clinic and a private psychologist at the Associates for Counseling in Brookline , Mass. , agrees . " Maternity clothes are a means to an end . No pregnant woman-in fact , no woman-should have to spend an immense amount of money just to feel she looks right , " she says . " And when you consider pregnancy only lasts a short time , it 's important not to let the emotionalism of the moment force you to make poor wardrobe decisions . " <p> Fortunately , Moorehead-Slaughter , who had her baby last April , was able to get through the first five months of her pregnancy wearing much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward unstructured garments anyway , " says Moorehead-Slaughter , " so I capitalized on the pieces I already owned that fit the bill and waited until it was absolutely necessary before I invested in other garments . " When she was ready to buy , Moorehead-Slaughter says she chose mostly dresses because they gave her a very professional look , but seemed more feminine than suits . They were also easier to find . " Dresses in larger sizes are perfect for pregnant women , if you shop carefully . I made sure the dress fit me correctly on the shoulders , then the rest of the fabric could simply flow . " Suits she believes , are a little more tricky . Rather than chance getting an ill-fitting suit in a large-size boutique , she would have gone to a maternity shop and bought a suit there if she decided that she needed one . Another way to economize during pregnancy is to borrow . " Women network for all kinds of reasons . I just ca n't understand why we have n't developed networks to pass business-styled maternity clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an attorney who owns her own firm and practices personal-injury law in St. Louis . " I just could n't see spending money on ten outfits I would wear every day for three months and then , possibly , never wear again . I thought there had to be a more feasible plan , and there was . " Riley used both her business and social contacts to get in touch with women who had recently become mothers . Through them , she was able to borrow most of what she needed , from suits and blouses to slacks and evening wear . " I had a very definite idea of what I was looking for and I knew my taste was toward conservative styles as well as colors , " explains Riley . " Fortunately for me , the women I borrowed from had a great sense of fashion and I did n't have to restructure my fashion attitudes right in the middle of having a baby ! " <p> Elaine Ray , an editorial writer for The Boston Globe whose daughter , Zuri , was born last April , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , so in spite of my own excitement , I wanted to keep everyone else focused on my work and not on my pregnancy , " says Ray . She went about her new clothing acquisitions in a very methodical way . " Every two weeks I went through my closet to see what I could still wear . Anything that did n't fit was moved to another closet . That gave me a clear focus on what pieces I had and what pieces I was missing , " explains Ray . " I bought enough pieces to have about three weeks worth of workable outfits . " Included in her purchases were a few dresses and suits , skirts , blouses , sweaters and a pair of stacks . Everything was coordinated in colors that could mix together to expand her wardrobe even further . " One of my major fashion focuses during my pregnancy was using accessories to give an outfit I was tired of wearing a different feel , " says Ray . " A scarf or a nice piece of jewelry can change your look and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she adds . <p> Some executives do find it necessary to attend semiformal or formal functions during pregnancy . Ray suggests including wardrobe pieces that can double for evening . Because she knew she would be pregnant over the Christmas holidays last year , Ray took her own advice and invested in a red jacket with a black velvet collar and a pair of black knit velour slacks . Together , they worked well ; separately , each filled a slot in her work wardrobe as well . <p> Another idea is renting an outfit for an evening from a clothing rental shop that specializes in either maternity or large-size fashions when you must dress up . ... And , Feeling Great <p> But having a good pregnancy is not just about what you wear , it 's about how you feel . And feeling good , as any mother will tell you , takes a little extra effort when you 're pregnant . <p> Venetia Coates , whose baby is due any day now , says that a little self-indulgence during pregnancy can go a long way . " Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the beauty salon weekly and let them pamper me , " says Coates , and once I 'm there I certainly ca n't leave without a manicure . " <p> Pampering yourself is a thought echoed by each of the pregnant executives . " We 're so used to thinking that ' thin is in ' , when our bodies balloon outward , even for as good a reason as this one , it has somewhat of a psychological effect on us , " says Moorehead-Slaughter . " Taking good care of my skin , hair and nails has helped me feel better during my pregnancy . " <p> Getting yourself in the right frame of mind and gearing your body up to perform at its personal best is something Elaine Ray strongly believes in . " Good eating habits are important to cultivate before you get pregnant , " she says . " And , if you start an exercise program before you 're pregnant , you can probably carry it through-almost to your due date-safely . " But , a doctor 's approval should be secured before beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rethought my meal plans so they included more green vegetables and cut back on salt , " adds Coates . An added benefit from these positive diet changes is a reduction in the bloating that plagues many pregnant women . Swelling can also be kept to a minimum by sitting with feet elevated at hip level as much as possible . " If at the end of a long day an expectant woman 's ankles and feet are swollen , she can alleviate the symptoms by lying on her side for an hour or so , " says Dr. Darwin Jackson , an obstetrician in St. Louis . <p> How colleagues and superiors react to an expectant executive 's pregnancy can be an important part of a woman 's adjustment period . Eve Riley , who gave birth to a baby boy last February , says that during her pregnancy she tried to remain as business-like as possible . " I kept a regular work schedule and stuck it out , even on days I did n't really feel up to it . My clients were depending on me and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she really didn't. see much of a change in how colleagues related to her professionally . " My partner is a little more protective of me because he 's a husband and father himself and can understand how I 'm feeling , " she says , " but in general , I just stick to the business at hand . " <p> Words of advice to other expectant mothers ? These moms and moms-to-be have plenty ! " Try to plan special times with your family during your pregnancy , " says Riley . " My husband and I went snorkeling when I was six months pregnant and we had a great time ! " <p> " Women have to be more vocal about our needs , " says Cooper Taylor , " we ca n't be afraid to ask for help . " <p> " As my proportions grew it became important to me to feet that I had some sort of control over my body , " says Moorehead-Slaughter , " so I took a walk daily almost to the end of my pregnancy . It helped me stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> And Eve Riley gives perhaps the best bit of advice : " Do n't be afraid . Everything falls into place miraculously . When I first got pregnant , I was afraid my business would fail . But instead of failing , it expanded as I did ! " TIPS FOR EXPECTING EXECUTIVES When you 're shopping for clothing , do n't forget to check out maternity consignment shops . Most larger cities have them and items are generally fairly new and in good condition . Wearing support maternity pantyhose is better for expectant mothers than wearing queen-size pantyhose . It helps protect pregnant women from developing varicose veins . If you travel for business , ask your doctor how long it 's safe for you to fly . Most advise stopping after your sixth month of pregnancy as a good rule of thumb . If you 'd prefer not to walk through the electronic security check , most airports in major cities have female guards who can give a hand check . Ouring long flights , do n't sit straight forward with your body erect ; instead turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from swelling . Also , drink plenty of water before boarding , get up and walk around periodically , and do n't wear binding , tight or uncomfortable clothing . Choose shoes that feel good to you . Some women prefer flats and there are dozens of flattering styles available . If you choose to wear heels , look for heel heights of no more than two inches and put them on after you get to the office . Opt for sneakers during your commute . If you spend a lot of time in front of a computer terminal , do n't worry . The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology says there is no evidence that a developing fetus can be harmed by low levels of transmitted radiation . But do get up and move around frequently and try to reduce stress by putting your feet up and padding your chair seat with a small pillow . Expectant mothers can get a better night 's sleep by keeping their head elevated with more than one pillow and by using at least one pillow to elevate feet . As the pregnancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side , since it usually becomes more difficult for her to breathe lying flat on her back . As the weather gets warmer you may find that your body 's cooling system does n't work as efficiently . Look for garments made from natural fibers , such as cotton and silk , that will allow your skin to breathe . Also , shop for sleeveless or short-sleeved dresses with jackets . This way , you can take the jacket off when you 're outside in the sun , but look perfectly professional when you 're at your desk . When you 're feeling down , spritz on a favorite perfume or buy a new one . Treat yourself to a manicure and pedicure or get your hair cut . The boost may be just what you need to get back on track . If you 've been active prior to expecting , ask your doctor if you can keep up an exercise program during pregnancy . For most women , the increased activity is good for both you and the baby . Stick with good nutrition-fresh fruits , vegetables , lean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while you 're pregnant . You 'll have more energy and feel less tired if you limit your intake of salty , starchy or sugary foods . Foods cooked with lots of spices almost universally cause nausea if you 're pregnant . Included in this category are pizza and most fast-food items . " The best way to avoid this kind of nausea is to avoid the foods that cause it , " says obstetrician Dr. Darwin Jackson . If you do accidentally encounter these foods lie down for a few minutes and wait until the feeling of queasiness passes . <p> By Eunice Fried <p>
