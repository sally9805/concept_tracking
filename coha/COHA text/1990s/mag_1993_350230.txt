Ca n't find peace on the streets <P> Til the niggaz get a piece <P> F  --  - the police <P> Lines to live by from gangsta rapper Tupac Amaru Shakur , 22 , who not long ago gave an interview on MTV with what looked to be a pistol tucked into his waist . Last week Shakur was arrested in Atlanta and charged in the shooting of two off-duty police officers . <P> After a concert at Clark Atlanta University , cars carrying Shakur and his friends nearly struck Mark and Scott Whitwell , brothers and suburban police officers , who were walking in civilian clothes with Mark 's wife . In the argument that followed , Shakur allegedly shot Mark in the back , his brother in the buttocks . Some witnesses say one of the Whitwells may have pulled a gun and fired first . Mark Whitwell 's attorney says they were surrounded by Shakur and at least a dozen others , some of them armed and screaming threats . <P> Is life imitating rap ? Faster than you could rhyme " niggaz " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking whether rappers  --  especially those from the Thugs-'R ' - Us subcategory called gangsta rap  --  are too quick to use the guns they brag about in their songs . " Who is the man with the master plan ? " asks a lyric by Snoop Doggy Dogg . " A nigga witta motherf  --   --  - ' gun . " Two weeks ago Snoop , 22 , was charged as an accomplice to murder . <P> Last week , just a day after Shakur 's arrest , Flavor Flav , 34 , court jester of the otherwise unsmiling rap group Public Enemy , was arrested for attempted murder . On Tuesday morning Flav , whose real name is William Drayton , accused a neighbor , Thelouizs English , of fooling with his girlfriend . After Drayton pulled a gun , English fled to the lobby , where Drayton allegedly caught up with him , took a shot and missed . Released on $15,000 bail , Drayton , who once served 20 days in jail for punching his girlfriend , checked into the Betty Ford Center . His record company says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't the first pop stars to cross from outlaw poses to real bloodletting . Sid Vicious of the Sex Pistols stabbed his girlfriend to death . Squeaky Claudine Longet , a vanilla songstress of the ' 60s and ' 70s , shot her boyfriend , a killing that she called accidental and a jury called criminally negligent homicide . But for the most part singers , even the ones who like to pal with mobsters , have been content to leave gunplay to the pros . Not gangsta rappers . In a world where it can seem as if everybody 's " strapped "  --  meaning armed  --  the rapper Spice 1 bragged to TIME last week , " I 'm gon na be strapped 24-7 . " ( That 's 24 hours a day , seven days a week . ) " I 've got an AK on the way , and that 's real , you know ? I 've got a TEC-9 . I got a little chrome .32 and a .380 . I 'm gon na get some more Glocks , I want some twin Glocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from " player-haters , " who he says try to bring down successful rappers . " Six guns coming out is gon na get us out of there , wherever we are . "
