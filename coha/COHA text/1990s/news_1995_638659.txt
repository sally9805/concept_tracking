<p> COLORADO SPRINGS - Michael Gonzales , who presents a great case for being Colorado 's best small-school athlete , has been made aware of the facts . <p> He was involved in a terrible accident last month . He has the scars and the hospital wristband as proof . He was nearly crushed by tons of machinery . He stopped breathing . He had no pulse . He was suffocated . <p> He was dead . <p> The thing is , though , he just ca n't seem to recall a darn thing - about any of it . <p> " I do n't know , " the 17-year-old said . " I just ca n't remember . " <p> " He 's still a little bashful about it , " family friend Elmer Stalford said . <p> Michael 's father , Manuel Gonzales , agreed : " It 's all just a blank for him . " <p> It 's lost time , iffy , trauma-filled hours . <p> Why would this kid want to remember something that horrible in the first place ? <p> Gonzales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrific physical condition , and perhaps because a situation with fatality written all over it was thwarted by a near-miraculous sequence that convinced many that it was the doing of someone or something not of this world . <p> Whatever , the rest of the Gonzales family never will forget . Nor will other southeast Coloradans such as Dana Musick , Buddy Barton , Ken Callison , Frank Griego , Stalford , and Jerry and Jimmy Park , to name a few . <p> How could they ? <p> Last July 3 , Michael , a three-year starter in football , basketball and baseball for Granada High School , a regular on Post all-state teams , a state-qualifier in track and field , and a strong student and a good kid , was operating an old tractor , " a vintage loader , 3 tons " as Stalford called it , as part of his summer employment . One aspect of working around grain elevators is that heavy equipment sometimes must move from site to site . He was going about 4 mph on Colorado 196 a few miles outside Granada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others must tell the story . <p> According to Musick , who was maybe a mile away and who admittedly " always gawks around " when he is driving his own tractor on the road , saw a tractor inadvertently veer off the road and out of sight . So he hurried to where he thought it went over and found it rolled over in an irrigation ditch . <p> But he did n't know what to think . <p> " I could n't even tell to go looking around ( for somebody ) , " Musick said . " But there were n't any tracks around , so I kept looking . " <p> Within a few moments of feeling around underneath the upside-down tractor in the mud and water , Musick found a leg . <p> Horrified , he knew what he had to do : " There was no way I was going to do anything by myself . I could n't get him out of there without help . So I flagged down the first car I could . " <p> It turned out to be Ken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luckily had a cellular phone to call 911 . The key word in the previous sentence is luckily . Callison told those who gathered at the site that he rarely takes his phone with him . <p> " Mr. Callison was headed to Burlington , " Musick said , " and he does n't like to have it with him because he said the dang thing rings all the time . But he decided to bring it that morning because he might need it . " <p> Next to be flagged down was Jerry Park . Others eventually happened by , wondering what the commotion was , then to see if they could help . <p> " It was like the whole damn town was there , " Stalford said . <p> Stalford , though , had a chain in his pickup truck , which was hooked up to Musick 's tractor . <p> Finally , after what seemed to be a very long time , they moved it enough to get to Michael . <p> " He was under water and sunk in the mud so much that you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But they were able to pull Michael out . He was soaking wet with some gashes , one on his head , another across his chest . He had no pulse and he was not breathing . <p> " Then Elmer and Buddy started mouth-to-mouth , " Musick said . <p> It took another precious few moments , but Michael finally started to gasp for air . <p> Said Stalford : " It 's not an experience I want to go through again . It 's scary to think that there was any chance Mike could come through something like that <p> " I was counting up the minutes and having bad thoughts . " <p> But they kept at it until the ambulance from nearby Holly arrived . <p> But before it did , Musick , like others on the scene , were wondering how they would get the news to Manuel . And here 's where perhaps the final irony in a wild few minutes was played out . <p> " I heard somebody say that we need to get word to Manuel , " Musick said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The father , who was on his way to visit another son , Manuel Jr. , also found himself on that fateful stretch of 196 . Granada 's athletic director and three-sport coach , a guy who also coached Musick in baseball at Granada in the 1970s , could see familiar faces desperately waving their arms trying to get his attention as he got closer . He knew it was an accident , but it did n't take too long to guess . <p> " You see an accident and think to yourself , ' I hope everything 's OK for these people , " ' he said . " Then I saw it was Frank waving and I kind of figured it out and kind of knew that the accident involved Michael . " <p> Still , he thought , a broken leg , a fractured arm what could it be ? <p> He got his answer a few seconds later . He saw his son , a wet and somewhat muddied , bloodied mess , being worked on by friends attempting to save his life . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I started to get angry and I was thinking , ' Michael , what the hell are you doing here ? Why did this happen to you ? Michael looked dead . " <p> " He sure did , " Stalford said . <p> But Michael hung on until the ambulance got there , and Manuel rode in it with his son to Lamar Hospital . <p> " Everybody was just sick about it , " Stalford said of those at the scene . " We just did n't see any way that he was going to make it . " <p> As well , on the ride to Lamar , Manuel vivedly remembers the paramedics " not being too sure if Michael was going to make it . " <p> Within 10 minutes of arriving at the hospital , it was determined that Penrose Medical Center would be the youth 's only chance . A Flight For Life helicopter got him there within 45 minutes . <p> " They worked on him and got him stabilized , " Manuel said . " He had a big gash on his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had so many tubes coming out of him he was in bad shape . " <p> " It was terrible , " said Ida Gonzales , Michael 's mom . <p> Michael remained unconscious for nearly three days , part of it induced to handle some of the trauma . <p> But the final minor miracle was on the verge of happening . Michael 's excellent conditioning , brought on by his fascination with playing sports , paid off - and delivered . <p> " They told us that if this had happened to an older person there was no way he or she could have survived , " Manuel said . " And the water in the ditch probably saved his life , cushioned his fall with the tractor coming on top of him . " <p> The big moments in Michael 's awakening came when he finally opened his eyes , then later responded to a verbal command by his dad to squeeze his hand . And he was able to recognize family and friends . <p> And get this ; he was discharged within a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sooner , but there was no one around on weekends to do the paperwork . <p> Said Ida : " A week ! A week ! Can you believe it . " <p> And he looks great - just like the kid who was tearing it up for the Bobcats on assorted ballfields . <p> Said Stalford : " He proved us all wrong . " <p> Still , Manuel said , " it 's hard for me to believe that there 's nothing wrong . No broken bones , no brain damage he may have been without oxygen for as long as 20 minutes and there 's nothing wrong with this kid . " <p> It has been estimated that Michael was submerged for anywhere from 8-12 minutes , maybe longer . <p> Musick , too , thinks the seat of tractor may have saved him : " It hit his chest and I think it cut off any water going into his lungs . Even when they checked him at the hospital he had hardly any water at all in there . " <p> Staples were used to seal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damage . The gash across his chest . He strained his right shoulder , the one he used to help Granada to last season 's baseball state title and earn Post MVP honors in the Class 2A state tournament . <p> And speech therapy will continue for a while , but Michael Gonzales is back in school , even pestering his parents to drive somewhere or go do the things he used to do . <p> " This should be on that 911 series on television , " Ida said . <p> Michael knows this may come to him some day , but he has no time to think about it . He has been running and lifting , just like always . <p> There probably will be no football for him this year , unless everyone in the family gets comfortable with the notion of a late-season return . It appears that being ready for the start of basketball practice is his target date . <p> " I 'm a little tired of the doctors , but everything 's going OK , " Michael said . " I 'm getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot better . " <p> " I know he does n't remember , " Ida said . " Just so he does n't know what we went through . It was a lot . " <p> Even for those in the Granada area . Said Musick : " Everybody knows everybody things fell together . " <p> " I have to admit , " Stalford said , " I probably would have just drove on by ( if he had n't seen friends at the site ) . " <p> Said Manuel : " Think about it . The way things happened , the way the people got to the scene , the guy seeing him , the guy calling 911 on the phone , the water in the ditch , me coming along <p> " I just want to thank all of the people who helped us , who saved his life and there 's one thing for sure . God said , ' I 'm going to do this to you people , then I 'm going to do this . ' <p> " If anything 's sure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "
