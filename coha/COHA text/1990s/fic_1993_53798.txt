My husband often traced what he called the minor flaws of my character to Kansas City , Missouri  --  a city he placed in the dead middle of the Midwest , a " stunningly homogeneous " town , he liked to say , where it must have been horrifyingly easy for me to grow up believing untruths about the world . Often enough I agreed with him about my hometown . I grew up there the overprotected and only child of a doting , widowed mother , and I grew up there a Catholic girl . The way I remember it is as a nine-year-old in the back of Sister Mary Benedict 's catechism class , as a girl tall and smart and timid enough to be trusted back there , out of Sister Mary Benedict 's reach , left to my own resources . <p> In Sister Mary Benedict 's catechism class , we mainly discussed sin  --  sins of omission and commission , venial sins and mortal sins . We were twenty-five girls preparing for the sacrament of penance . On Good Friday we would line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the first time . Sister Mary Benedict wanted us to feel , in those last few days , the privilege of our own redemption . She urged us to imagine a flock of white birds mired in sticky tar suddenly breaking free and clean . <p> Pretty girls who sat in a cluster near the coat rack tried to charm Sister Mary Benedict with claims that they had no true sins , none that mattered anyway , none that were n't eased by something as simple as the confiteor recited at daily Mass . Someday they might commit sin , they told her  --  it was possible that someday they might commit even mortal sin  --  but when they were grown , when they were women . They shifted in their chairs at the word . They rolled their eyes at one another . Watching them , I saw that the idea of womanhood embarrassed them  --  much the way the idea of sin embarrassed them  --  sin and womanhood both distant , querulous predictions . I had to raise my hand a long time before Sister Mary Benedict noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing next to my chair . " Suppose I had committed a sin , but then I was deeply sorry in my own heart . And suppose I was on my way to the church to confess when a milk truck ran me down . " <p> In a black-and-white movie my mother had watched on Saturday afternoon while she combed out my hair , I 'd seen a man run down by a milk truck . He had been on his way to tell a woman that he loved her . The woman was a beautiful invalid . She loved him , too , but out of pride or misguided kindness , she had never told him . In her wheelchair , she took the news of the man 's death stoically while my mother 's tears ran down my bare shoulders . <p> Sister Mary Benedict was a tall nun , heavy and hard except for her long , milk-white hands . The weathered skin around her eyes pinched into furrows at my question , and the pretty girls quieted . I stood waiting next to my chair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which then was the blank , open face of a girl in a movie , the face of a girl who thought runaway milk trucks were about the limit of injustice in the world . " God would still welcome me , would n't He , Sister ? " I said . " He 'd open His arms , right ? " <p> Sister Mary Benedict tucked her hands inside her habit and arranged them secretly at her waist . I watched her and thought , oddly , She 's a woman inside those clothes  --  like my mother or the invalid that man died trying to reach . A flush spread under her cheekbones , and I worried for a moment that she 'd known my thoughts , that she was angry . When my mother was angry , she opened her pocketbook and threw things  --  tubes of lipstick , car keys , crumpled tissues  --  but Sister Mary Benedict stood still and dire as a beam of light , her eyes only on me . I saw then the answer to another question I 'd once pondered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That question had been : Why would she do it  --  give up men , cars , cologne , colors , and desire ? I saw then that she 'd done it to become what she was at that moment  --  a woman in black about to pass on cruel facts to a stupid , winsome girl . <p> " God would not welcome you , Nora . " She spoke quietly , lowering her eyes when she said my name . Then she looked at me again . " You would die alone and outside His love . " <p> The pretty girls smirked at me as I sat down , but I thought , Okay . All right . I believed hen In my mind , God was a man , and though I had never really known any men outside of Father Lucardo , I had seen him often enough  --  sitting in Sister Mary Benedict 's chair , asking each girl to stand as he read aloud in stentorian tones the grades from her quarterly report  --  to understand that some part of a man 's stature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or require him to be merciless . <p> That night after my bath I sat again at my mother 's feet in the soft light of the TV while she put up my hair She dipped a wooden wide-toothed comb into scented water , ran it through my hair , then wound sections up in strips of soft flannel . I leaned my cheek against her solid knee . She was watching her favorite variety show . On it , three girls in elaborate wigs sang a sad song about all the trouble they 'd had after they 'd gone out into the world and forgotten what their mothers told them . They 'd lost their shy and happy homes . They 'd lost their pasts . They 'd lost their hearts , they sang . I sat up between my mother 's knees . The girls blinked glamorous , affecting tears under their mountains of hair . They sang words like never , ever , always . I believed them , too . <p> " Gullibility is not a victimless crime , " was what my husband liked to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be such a strange , long-suffering woman , frightened of my own needs , inordinately interested in doing the right thing . My husband married me more gently than his opinions implied . When we met , he was a tough , suspicious , hair-trigger sort of man  --  easily angered , quick to push back his chair and walk away  --  but in my presence , he quieted , he settled , and he listened as I rambled through a set of stories I believed must represent the central confusions of my life . " You know , you think too much , " he told me once across a table in a crowded restaurant . " You study your life like it 's an equation , like you expect an answer . " When he said it , I knew he was right , but I was not ashamed because I also knew he was a little mesmerized by and a little protective of the frailty of my hope . Standing to leave the restaurant that night , he took my elbow gently in his hand , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the delicacy that underlies any true authority . He looked at me for a moment , and then he steered me out of the restaurant . <p> So it was lightly that my husband eased me away from home and church , from my mother , from many of my qualities . There were times I admired him more than I did myself . He had been , before he met me , an adventurer . He 'd gone places . He 'd done things . Once , on a bluff overlooking a cornfield where we 'd stopped to rest coming back from a day trip to the country , he told me a story about waking up from an opium sleep to an earthquake in Burma . Hanging in a hammock , he 'd been dreaming , he said , of a deep rumble , the sound of a plane touching down . When he opened his eyes , he saw the treetops above him shiver eerily in no wind , and when he sat up , the ground rose with him and then bowed away from him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the edge of his clearing down a ravine . There was no one around  --  the man who had rented him the hut lived half a day 's walk through the jungle  --  and there was no sound but the rumble and the crack of falling trees . My husband , though , felt a strange calm . Finally , he said , he 'd gotten far enough away from all he 'd been and known . There did n't seem to be anything he could or should do . He watched a huge tree fall slowly to crush a line of smaller trees , and he sat still , waiting for what would happen next . <p> I took his hand after he told me that , and I drew closer to him . Giving myself to a man might finally have a purpose , was the wish I was making . I 'd been in love by then often enough to have noticed that my passion for any man coincided pretty neatly with the urgency of my need to escape my own character . I 'd seen myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incoherent plays . Yet here was a man who had escaped himself long ago , on a clouded day in Burma , while trees fell around him and the ground grew supple and undulate . I do n't think anyone who has ever wanted to feel the world as frankly as a stand of corn or a common bird would not have taken the chance I took . <p> We ended up in Chicago , where he had a friend who was storing a trunk for him . In that trunk was the money my husband had made during what he called his " invisible time . " After high school , he sent away for a book called Your Right to Privacy , which explained how to live outside government , how to remove your name from birth records and social security rolls . He lived for ten years like that , traveling the world , avoiding the draft and taxes , and after we were married we moved the trunk from his friend 's apartment to ours . <p> " I feel criminal , " I said , next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wedged into the back seat . I was remembering something my mother had said before we left Kansas City : You do n't marry men like him , she told me . You carry their pictures in a locket . You keep their letters at the back of a lingerie drawer . " I feel like we 're moving a body or something . " <p> " Do n't , " he told me . " No one in the world knows about this money except you . If it makes you nervous , you only have to forget about it . That 's about as gone as anything gets . " <p> On that day , which was a cool summer day with a breeze off the lake , I looked out at the skyline of Chicago , the long towering line of apartment buildings that edged the shore . Still new to the city , ! was moved by how many people lived there , and I felt a stranger to myself , as though I could forget everything . He turned the radio on low and I rolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my neck and then settled it again . I leaned back against the seat and closed my eyes . When I opened them again , we were home . <p> Even the baby was not a surprise . He wanted her , and after a childhood during which I 'd been led to believe that even my good intentions could not save me , I wanted a baby who would grow up with him as father . While I was pregnant and full of extravagant feeling , I dreamed her  --  a rangy girl with tangled hair running over hills along the African coast , part of a graceful , long-legged herd of children that zagged toward the water like gazelles , then eased smoothly inland in a sudden shared choreography of will . <p> We named her Willa as a kind of testament to that dream . She was a long , lean , blond baby with delicate fingers , quick eyes , and a serious mouth , and she was a baby of considerable will . From the day she was born , she hated sleep . She 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of sneaking dozes as if someone had thrown a blanket over her head . At some point we noticed that she closed her eyes easily only in clamorous and well-lighted public places  --  restaurants , El platforms , the Sunday afternoon beach  --  as if she needed hearty assurance of the world even as she slept . So nights at her bedtime we spread her quilt on the living-room floor , turned on all the lights and the TV , and talked over her until she drifted off . <p> One night , when Willa was thirteen months old and still struggling against being weaned , the three of us watched a documentary on the westernization of China together . The insistent monotone of the interpreter 's speech combined with the strange swallowed cadences of the Chinese to please Willa in some way . She lay on her back , very still and alert , her eyes open , her thumb in her mouth . I could see that she was happy . Though she was n't looking at me , I smiled at her and then over my shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the screen . He looked as happy as she did . <p> " I 've got to get there before I die , " he said . My husband had been so many places in his life that he spoke of far-off corners of the world the way I spoke of the dry cleaner 's down the block . " Just up the beach from Montevideo , " he 'd say , or " about a kilometer outside Toowoomba . " Now he was a computer specialist , a systems troubleshooter for a huge corporation that sat far out in the suburbs on sixty acres of land , but China , open and in front of him , sat him up in his chair . He patted his pockets for his cigarettes and leaned toward the set . " Watch this now . This is one of the world 's last mysteries . " <p> On the TV , peasants swamped a group of American tourists shooting sixty-second film . The tourists shot their Polaroids frantically and tossed pictures into the crowd . There was a close-up of a man holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face reflected first a kind of simple , nodding good cheer , and then , as I imagined he began to recognize the features of his own child , a reverence . He pressed the snapshot to his chest and looked up into the filmmaker 's camera . What his face showed then was gratitude . " Look at that , " I said . " Look at that face . It makes me want to go over there with whole crates of cameras . " <p> " We 'd become millionaires . " <p> " Oh , not to sell , " I told him . " I 'd want to give it all to them . " He looked at me sharply . I thought perhaps Willa had stirred , but she was curled up now on the quilt , sleeping . " What ? <p> He lit another cigarette , then threw the matchbook down . It skidded across the coffee table and fell to the rug . " Nothing , " he said . " I just hope that 's your hormones talking . I hope that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's me . " I stretched away from Willa to reach the matchbook . " Pay attention . " I tossed the matches back at him . " I 'm your wife . " <p> He snatched the matchbook out of the air , slipped it in his pocket , and smiled . " I recognize you , " he said . " You 're my wife , all right . " <p> I looked back at the TV . <p> " Hey , " he said until I turned around again . " All I meant is you ca n't just give things to people . You murder your own chances , and you murder theirs . Any good missionary will tell you that . Besides , what those people love about Americans is not all our stuff . What those people love about Americans is how we got all our stuff  --  buying and selling , putting our own needs first . " <p> " Do n't get all tough-guy , citizen-of-the world with me . It 's a TV show . We 're watching TV . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the TV , still smiling . " Let 's do that . " <p> I lay down next to Willa , who did stir then . She gave up her thumb and began to pull at my clothes , fretting to nurse . I slid her across my lap and patted her hard between the shoulder blades , which occasionally calmed her . Then I looked back at him . " And do n't talk to me about hormones when I 'm weaning our child . " <p> " Give me that baby . How can you expect her not to need you when you 're right there next to her ? " <p> I handed him Willa and he laid her on her back next to him on the couch , settling one hand on her chest . He did n't stroke her or pat her or try to ease her , and this benign neglect worked . She watched him for a while , fiddled with his fingers , then found her thumb again . I looked back at the documentary . The interviewer was examining a farming couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in identical chairs , wearing almost identical clothing , and they appeared to be equally embarrassed by his curiosity . " I 'm wondering , " the interviewer said , " what provokes marriage here . What sorts of needs are fulfilled by it ? Is it love , production , procreation ? " The Chinese farmer cocked his head . He appeared actually to wince under the weight of this question , while his wife 's uneasy smile grew more distant and fixed . I knew they were n't going to answer , but I sat up anyway and paid strict attention . Like the interviewer , I did n't know much about marriage . Even after three years with my husband , I still had the sense I was making myself and the two of us up as I went along . The Chinese couple exchanged a quiet glance , and as I watched them , some part of me held out hope that marriage meant two people resigned in good humor to their own poor characters . I realized then that I still believed in redemption  --  even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someday and show me my need by meeting it . <p> Not long after that night in front of the documentary , my voice began to change . Willa noticed first , and it was the change in her behavior  --  her constant demands for me to talk to her , sing to her , tell her stories  --  that alerted my husband . " Something 's different , " he told me one day at breakfast . " Your voice is younger  --  breathier or something . It 's different somehow . She hears it . " I worried for the two weeks it took to get an appointment with my doctor , but when he saw me , he said I was okay , he said I was fine , it was only nodes  --  a lot of them , but benign . Then he referred me to a surgeon . <p> In the recovery room , I woke to someone slapping my forearm . " Open your eyes , " she kept saying . " I need to hear your voice . " There was a slim possibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been damaged , though I trusted the surgeon , a cancer specialist accustomed to far more delicate and taxing surgery than mine . I opened my eyes . The room was tiled white and cold as an icehouse . Suddenly a woman 's face , fleshy and florid under her surgical cap , was above mine . " Are you trying ? " she said . " You 're not , are you ? " Under her gaze , I felt puny and dissolute . I wanted to ask her for a blanket or for something to make me sleep again , but I could hear how busy she was . I knew she would n't bring me anything , that she 'd listen to me choke on a syllable , then disappear . <p> " I can see you 're awake , " she said , " and I 'm going to stand here until you say something . " I closed my eyes then . I felt a deep , delicious stubbornness . <p> A few days before , I had taken Willa out to buy a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away the plastic thing with the miniature palm tree and do it right . At the pet store , I shopped capably , choosing a modest but spacious tank with a built-in sunning ledge , and Willa helped carry a bag of colored rocks up the steps to our apartment . " Bobo is going to love all this , " I told her . " He 's going to stop feeling like a dime-store attraction . He 's going to feel like a real turtle when we 're done . " <p> When I opened our front door , I saw my husband kissing a twenty-year-old girl who sometimes messengered his reports around his office complex . They were in the dining room . My husband had the girl pressed up against the table . Her back was arched and both his hands were involved in her long hair . <p> I pushed Willa behind me . " Okay , " I said . " That should do it . " <p> She was a raw-boned girl , with fleshy , full thighs and large breasts loose under her T-shirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself silkily . When she looked at me , her eyes were still dreamy . <p> " Get out , " I said . " You get out of my house . " <p> My husband drew Willa from behind me and guided her down the hall and into her playroom . " Show Bobo his new pebbles , " I heard him say . For a moment , the girl and I were alone together . She stood still , not looking at me , then tucked her T-shirt into her jeans . My husband came up the hall . He reached behind me to push the door closed , then stood between us . " Do you want to sit down ? " he said . " Do you want to talk about this ? " <p> I saw that he meant to create out of this chaos some sort of civilized and complicated event . I would n't have expected that from him . The girl relaxed at the sound of his voice . She drew her hair up in both her hands , then dropped it over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . <p> I think even before she spoke I had decided that I could not bear to hear her voice in my house . " You realize , do n't you , " I said to her , " that you 're a lower form of life . That the damn house plants are laughing at you . " <p> She squinted at me . " Your husband does n't seem to think so , " she said . We both looked at him . He put his hands in his pockets and shook his head lightly at the floor . <p> " I guess we ca n't be too sure of what my husband thinks , can we ? " <p> She picked up her bag , a ridiculous cloth pouch held dosed with a safety pin , from under the dining-room table . " Well , I 'm leaving , " she said , looking my husband in the face as she passed him . I reached behind me to pull the door open , but only enough so that she had to slide through . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the click of the latch . <p> My husband and I looked at each other then in a new way , in the strange new light of my sudden authority . " I 'm sorry . It was stupid , " he said . " It was unseemly . I 've insulted you , and I 'm sorry . " <p> I pulled a chair away from the dining-room table and sat down . " I always thought you would n't lie . You might run off to Bogota for six months , but you would n't lie . " <p> " I 'm not lying now , Nora . You know what she is . You nailed her . Do n't pretend you do n't know what happened here . Do n't pretend you do n't know how insignificant she is , because I 'm not going to pretend she 's more than that " ' <p> " I know what happened here , " I said . I looked up at him . " I just want you to know there 's going to be a problem for us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is going to be . That problem is going to be that I needed to believe that you would not do this , that you would never do this . " <p> He sat down across from me , looked out into the living room for a time , and then back at me . " I did n't ask you to believe that , " he said . " I would n't have . You believed that on your own . If you 'd asked me , I would have said , ' Never say never , Nora . One , it 's sentimental . Two , it 's dangerous . And three , it 's always a lie . ' " <p> In the recovery room , it occurred to me that it might be useful to be mute . I have large , expressive eyes . I could drive him mad , never offering him a word . <p> Outside an elevator , as the gurney on which I lay was rolled down a hallway and then nudged up against a wall , I woke to the scent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good sports coat . Then I felt his presence next to me . He touched my hair and ran the back of his hand across my cheek  --  odd , stylized gestures that I could not quite appraise . I kept my eyes closed . I thought of my mother . She had called the day before from Kansas City and asked to speak with my husband  --  something she had never in the three years of my marriage asked of me . I had told her about the young girl , and so I hesitated . " You 're my only child , " she said into the pause . " Now put that man on the telephone . " <p> I held the receiver out to him . " My mother , " I said . <p> He spoke to her in dipped affirmatives . Yes , he would , he said . He knew that , he said . He was sure , he told her . Then he handed the phone back to me . <p> " He says he 'll be there for you , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " <p> " I think so , " I told her . <p> " Well , I suppose this could be good . He should take care of you for a while . He should remember his responsibilities . " Slower then , with less certainty , she said , " I suppose this could be to your advantage . " <p> " I suppose . " <p> " So I wo n't come , then . " <p> " I guess not , " I told her . <p> Next to my gurney , my husband stood still . I knew he was staring down at me , though I did not open my eyes . I think I believed that my pain and deep fatigue would offer a clearer sense of the genuine than anything I might see . <p> " Your wife ? " I heard a woman say . <p> " Yes . " <p> " One of Dr. Scranton 's patients ? " <p> " Yes , " my husband said again . <p> " So am I. So is half this ward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miracle , you know . Even the nurses say so . You keep that at the front of your mind now . You hold on to that . " I realized then that she believed I was a cancer patient , and in the quiet that followed her remark , ! knew my husband had realized that , too . I heard , in the silence , his confusion . It pleased me . " She 's very young , " the woman said . <p> " She is . " My husband paused again , and then he said , " We have a one-year-old daughter . " The woman gasped a little at this new and deepened sense of my tragedy . I came ferociously awake , feeling a little like Willa as I opened my eyes . The woman took a step back . My husband removed his hands from the side bar of my bed and put them in his pockets . <p> Two nurses came then , and pushed my gurney into a room . They arranged rolled towels on both sides of my neck to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shroud , then slid me off the gurney onto a hospital bed . Over their heads , I watched my husband hang back in a corner of the room . After they left , he came to sit on the edge of the bed . He fingered a corner of the sheet , then folded it over the shoulder of my gown . " The doctor said it went well . He wants you to try your voice . " <p> " You son of a bitch , " I mouthed at him . <p> He stood up from the bed , running both his hands through his hair , moving toward the door ; then he turned back to me . " What would you have said to her , Nora ? ' My wife 's not dying and I 'm sorry if you are ? ' Is that what you would have said ? For six hours "  --  he pointed behind him to the door  --  " I have been sitting in a goddamn surgical waiting room . " Leaning closer to me , he spoke through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine in those rooms , Nora ? " <p> I felt my eyes fill with tears and so I closed them . After a time , he said , " I need to pick up Willa . I 'll be back tomorrow . " <p> I opened my eyes . <p> " After lunch , " he said . He laid one hand on mine . " Try your voice , Nora . " <p> I shook my head lightly . <p> Bending to kiss my forehead , he whispered , " All right then , do n't . " <p> After he left , I wondered what sort of sin it was to imagine the death of your wife , and I wondered , had he imagined my experience of it  --  the pain , the terrible slipping into loss  --  or only his own experience , only the absence ? <p> Twice in my hospital bed I woke up confused . The first time I saw outside my window a low grove of trees on a grassy hillock , and I believed I was home , in Kansas City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixteen , I 'd been kept in quarantine for scarlet fever . My mother had been allowed to visit me then only for a few nervous minutes each day , and since she was n't at my bedside , the doctors must have felt they could speak their news directly to me . So they worried aloud  --  formally and gravely  --  over a weakening valve in one of the chambers of my heart . I had believed they meant I was dying . Outside my window then a narrow park rolled up another hill and on it sat a tower in memory of war dead . Sixteen years old , in my dosed room , a window away from a sunny morning , ! felt something more kindred than age and inequity with the boys memorialized by that tower . I felt the pure , hollow loneliness of doom . That hospital had been a Catholic hospital , and each day , just after dawn , a priest came to my room wearing a surgical mask and carrying a chalice covered by a linen napkin . He touched my shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he whispered , as if we were on sacred ground , " Child , would you like to receive the Holy Eucharist ? " Each day I told him no . <p> The second time , I woke to a swoon of pain as a woman I believed must be my mother removed a drain from the incision in my neck and then arranged a new dressing over the wound . She nursed me the way my mother had nursed me as a child  --  with a light , tender touch that felt quickened by fear . I reached out for her hand , and she leaned dose to whisper , " Do n't move , honey . You do n't want to feel how sick you 'll be if you move . " When she slid open the heavy drape , I was confused by the sunlight . My mother had only touched me that way in the middle of the night , as if her love and dread ranged wilder in the darkness . Outside my window I saw the low trees again , and though this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my window felt closer to home than I was , offered a promise , a contiguity . If I walked over that hill , and then kept walking , I could get there . I dosed my eyes and slept . <p> When I woke again , a woman stood in my doorway  --  the same woman who had spoken with my husband yesterday , the woman who believed I had cancer . Her face , anxious and tentative , still held the memory of what my husband had told her . I tried to raise myself in bed , but I moved too suddenly and a searing pain tore through my throat . Then , with horror , I felt the nausea the nurse had warned me about . I reached out to the woman in the doorway . " I 'm going to be sick , " I said in a voice grainy and guttural , but familiar . Fingering the dressing over my throat , I said , " Oh my God , do n't let me be sick . " <p> The woman rushed to my bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " Lie very still . Breathe through your mouth . You wo n't be sick , dean You wo n't be . " <p> I did what she said and slowly the nausea subsided . I sank deeper into my pillows , exhausted then , and I closed my eyes . She stayed at my bedside , smoothing a blanket over my shoulders , gently pressing the rolled towels closer to my neck . " I should n't have startled you . " Her voice was low and hushed . " I only meant to peek in , say a good word . " She patted my hand for a moment . " You 're all right now , are n't you ? " she said . <p> I was just at the brink of sleep when she said it , but I felt myself called back lightly into consciousness  --  the way I 'd felt since Willa was born , when I would linger briefly each night on the edge of sleep and wonder if I 'd tuned her radio to an all-night station , latched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do for her . I opened my eyes and saw that she was an older woman with thinning , frowsy hair and a kind face , an earnest face . She still held my hand in hers . " I 'm not really dying , " I whispered to her . <p> " Oh , of course you 're not , dear . " She squeezed my hand firmly between both of hers . " Of course you 're not , " she said . <p> <p> By JANET DESAULNIERS <p> JANET DESAULNIERS 's fiction and potry have appeared in The Amherst Review , The San Francisco Bay Guardian , and The Hawaii Review , among other magazines .
