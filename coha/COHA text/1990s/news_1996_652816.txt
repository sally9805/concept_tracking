<p> FOR ALL OF ITS SMOOTH , sometimes overheated craftsmanship , Ronald Harwood 's " Taking Sides , " now at the Brooks Atkinson Theater , accomplishes a feat not often witnessed in our commercial theater : it simultaneously illuminates the complex character of a great artist and preserves the integral mysteriousness of his mind . <p> The philistines do n't come off well here , but neither does the artist . He is Wilhelm Furtwangler ( 1886-1954 ) , the celebrated German conductor who chose to remain in Nazi Germany when his Jewish colleagues were forced to leave or face deportation to the camps , and when many of his non-Jewish colleagues went into voluntary exile in protest . <p> As there were no easy answers during his life , there are none in " Taking Sides , " which examines Furtwangler 's motives as they are revealed during preparations for his appearance before the Denazification Tribunal in 1946 . <p> The setting is occupied Berlin , the office of United States Army Maj. Steve Arnold ( Ed Harris ) , a quick-thinking , boorish man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is " to nail the bandleader , " meaning Furtwangler ( Daniel Massey ) as a collaborator . In putting together the brief that the Americans will present to the commission , the major exhibits zeal but little wit . He 's a blunt instrument . " There 's always one question the guilty ca n't answer , " the major says early on . His intention : to find the question . <p> Though the major is played with riveting , pumped-up energy by Mr. Harris , he is less a character than a function of the plot . His motives for wanting to humiliate Furtwangler , using blackmail and bribes if he must , seem bogus in view of his insensitivity in all other matters . There are four supporting characters in the play , but " Taking Sides " has the form of a duel between Furtwangler and the major , who is such an oversimplification that you might expect the fight to be no-contest . That it is a contest , and that the play leaves you with something more than a playbill to carry home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Furtwangler character and to Mr. Massey 's superlative performance in the role . The contest turns out to be less between the major and the conductor than between the conductor and himself . <p> Mr. Harwood so constructs " Taking Sides " ( a production of which was presented in London last year ) that Furtwangler has come to dominate the stage even before Mr. Massey makes his entrance . The facts are laid out : though Furtwangler continued to work in Nazi Germany and was , indeed , Hitler 's favorite conductor , he never joined the Nazi Party . He was public in his outrage at the treatment of Jewish composers and musicians , would not conduct at official state ceremonies , and , on one occasion that became noteworthy , refused to give the Nazi salute to Hitler . <p> When Furtwangler finally appears halfway through the first act , a tall , almost bald , hulking but rather dainty man , he has the reserved manner of one of nature 's born aristocrats . He is unsurprised by the major 's rudeness and speaks only when a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't leave Germany because " that would have been a victory for them . " His duty , he says , was to stay , to keep alive the true spirit of German culture . As the play proceeds , we recognize that Furtwangler was never an especially warm man , but then he never masqueraded as one . The major suggests that he made a pact with the devil in return for a plush life and the acclaim that only the regime could guarantee him . Furtwangler is genuinely shocked : art and politics need not intersect . <p> He is eloquent on the subject of Herbert von Karajan , another conductor who stayed in Germany , was lionized , joined the Nazi Party ( twice ) and was denazified with seeming ease . The major suggests that Furtwangler pulled strings to have a powerful music critic , who preferred Karajan , sent off to the Russian front . Furtwangler finds that idea absurd . Dark clouds on the horizon : his passion begins to show . As any idiot should know , he objects to Karajan because he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " The slow tempi are too slow , the fast ones too fast . The whole effect is somewhat hysterical . " He ca n't bear to speak Karajan 's name . When necessary , he refers to him as K. <p> Behind all this talk of German culture , German spirit and Art , there is a dangerous kind of self-serving elitism . Evidence is presented to the effect that Furtwangler was instrumental in the escape of a number of Jewish musicians . Yet in the one case we hear about , he had the young man , a pianist , play three minutes of the Beethoven " Waldstein " Sonata before agreeing to help . What would have happened if the fellow had been a second-rater ? For that matter , did Furtwangler 's obsession with his art really put him at such a far remove from the world around him ? Could such a sophisticated man be so naive ? <p> In addition to the performances by Mr. Massey and Mr. Harris , the production is well served by David Jones 's direction , David Jenkins 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in what looks to be the shroud of bombed-out Berlin , and by the supporting cast : Elizabeth Marvel , Michael Stuhlbarg , Norbert Weisser and Ann Dowd . <p> " Taking Sides " is a surprisingly entertaining play in the mode of theater that persuades you to think , without seriously disturbing your equilibrium . The moral questions it raises would have been inflammatory 50 years ago . It may be to our discredit that today some will find them academic . ' Sex And Longing ' <p> Christopher Durang 's " Sex and Longing , " the Lincoln Center Theater production at the Cort Theater , also raises a question , one that you probably never thought to ask , and answers it without help from the audience . Can a revue sketch run two and a half hours , including two intermissions , and still be great , zany , some might even suggest serious fun ? No . <p> The evidence is on the stage , where Sigourney Weaver is playing Lulu , sometimes also called Sadie Thompson , a well-born Washington nymphomaniac who falls into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peter Michael Goetz ) . The other characters include a right-wing senator ( Guy Boyd ) with a passion for prostitutes , his Bible-thumping wife ( Dana Ivey ) , the gay young man ( Jay Goede ) who shares Lulu 's apartment , and Jack the Ripper ( Eric Thal ) . <p> Mr. Durang 's apparently still unfinished comedy is a shapeless amalgam of absurdist theater , satire and parody . Its individual parts connect none too well , though there are just enough funny lines to keep you thinking things will get better . Ms. Ivey has some priceless but very isolated moments . There is also a promising Senate subcommittee hearing on pornography at which Jesus is a surprise witness . ( He is in favor of both capital punishment and a cut in the capital gains tax . ) With a little rewriting , this scene might stand on its own in a real revue . The play 's final scene evokes " Angels in America . " The mind reels , but the eyes do n't close . Such bewilderment is stronger than caffeine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look pretty and even expensive . Mr. Durang and Ms. Weaver , friends since their days at the Yale School of Drama , have collaborated before , but far more effectively . He will owe her for this one until hell freezes over . ' Fit to Be Tied ' <p> " Angels in America " is also evoked in " Fit to Be Tied , " Nicky Silver 's new play at Playwrights Horizons about a menage a trois involving a society woman named Nessa , her son , Arloc , and her son 's lover , Boyd . Boyd makes his first appearance in great white wings and a white gown , having just dashed over from Radio City Music Hall , where he 's in the Christmas show . There are some exceptionally funny lines in " Fit to Be Tied , " most of them spoken with panache by Jean Smart as Nessa . But the play still seems unfinished , as if Mr. Silver had n't yet decided what , exactly , he wants to say about the randomness of love in the age of AIDS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beginning with his name ( is it an anagram and do you care ? ) , Arloc , played by T. Scott Cunningham , is a mystery , a frail , nervous , lonely heir to a fast-food fortune . Boyd ( Matt Keeslar ) would seem to be a 90 's update on the kind of bisexual stud Tennessee Williams used to write about . David Warren was the director . " Fit to Be Tied " is for hard-core Nicky Silver watchers . <p> ' Chimere ' And ' Area Boy ' <p> The Brooklyn Academy of Music 's 1996 Next Wave Festival has begun with a vengeance . The first theater event : the production of " Chimere , " a chic horse show of sorts imported from Paris , whose run at the Big Top in Battery Park City has been extended until Nov. 10 . While " Chimere " has been playing in Manhattan , " The Beatification of Area Boy , " the West Yorkshire Playhouse production imported from Leeds , England , has completed a five-day run at the academy 's Majestic Theater in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " a rollicking , politically loaded pageant of a play by Wole Soyinka , Nigeria 's Nobel laureate , would seem to have more meat on its bones than all of the 26 mercilessly trained beasts in " Chimere . " <p> If I have reservations about " Area Boy , " it 's because a lot of the dialogue , spoken by the mostly black English and African cast , was beyond the reach of untuned American ears . This was a production in desperate need of supertitles . Yet a reading of the text confirms that the play is the work of a satirist with a fine , controlled gift for theater . " Area Boy , " about a day in the lives of some exuberant Lagos street people , mixes music , knockabout comedy , magic and tragedy as it sends up the chaotic political situation in the homeland from which Mr. Soyinka is currently exiled . <p> " Chimere " is a production of Zingaro , a French equestrian troupe that under Bartabas , its founder , director and star , is dedicated to passing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistake of not reading the program before the show started . <p> While in the pitch-dark tent , sitting on a backless wooden plank ( a $75 seat , which I did not pay for but still made me sore ) , trying to breathe oxygen through incense as thick as cigar smoke at a stag party , I was under the impression that I was simply watching some rather impressive horsemanship . As busy lighting effects cut the gloom , one could make out riders doing impossible things on the backs of horses . They stood , did flips , or hung head down as the horses galloped madly around the very small ring . Dangerous stuff . <p> Yet there are only so many things you can do on the back of a horse in a family show . Sometimes the horses perform solo . They walk backward . They dance . These displays are regularly interrupted by peculiar tableaux vivants in or at the edge of the green wading pool , which is at the center of the ring . <p> Illuminated briefly , as if by lightning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glamorous robe of monkish origin and astride a magnificent steed , a great long lance held perpendicular to the water . Pause . Blackout . Applause . A moment later : Bartabas illuminated again , on the same horse , in the same reflecting pool , but headed in the opposite direction ! Even more applause . I should also mention the Indian musicians and dancers who perform from time to time , possibly to calm any overexcited people in the audience . <p> Not till I got home and read the very extensive program notes did I realize that I had n't been at the circus at all . I had been watching a man 's " journey to his imagined origins  --  a journey to Rajasthan , the mythical home of all gypsies . " Most members of the audience , who had done their homework , were entranced . I felt bamboozled , though one lesson was learned : from now on , if I can smell a show before it begins , I 'm leaving .
