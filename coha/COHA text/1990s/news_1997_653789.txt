<p> After enduring countless difficulties setting up an at-home business in a nearby suburb , Joe and Teri Comroe moved here five years ago so they could repair clocks and watches from their house . <p> The Comroes paid Tacoma $72 for a basic business license to open their Reliable Time Shop , which they run in two rooms of a small house in a neighborhood where each adjoining house also harbors a home-based business . <p> Two years later , the Comroes ' business taxes increased after the Tacoma City Council decided to require home businesses to buy an additional license purely for the privilege of operating out of their home . The $122 a year that the Comroes pay may seem trivial , but it illustrates how Tacoma , like many other cities , has found a new , though still modest , source of revenue from the exploding number of home businesses . <p> " The city calls it a home-occupancy license , " Mr. Comroe said , " but it 's really just a tax , just a way to take in more money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporations have downsized and more people have gone into business for themselves , the home-business phenomenon has emerged from obscurity . And many cities , rather than ignoring or trying to suppress it as they often did in the past , are seeking to exploit the trend to their own advantage . <p> The first step in this process for many cities has been to revise zoning laws that were drafted to prohibit home businesses in an era when many such workplaces were smelly , messy industrial operations , such as repairing car engines . <p> After that relatively simple step , the most aggressive of these cities have gone much further , both in seeking to make the cities attractive for home businesses and to tap a little vein of revenue from them . And in hunting for unlicensed businesses , they have uncovered many more than they expected . The extra revenue they get from these previously untaxed companies is helping to hold down pressures to raise taxes elsewhere . <p> Polly Rumbough , the occupational licensing official in Tampa , Fla. , said , " We are taxing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now counts on fees from home-based businesses and professionals for $8 million annually , or 2 percent of the city 's general operating budget . <p> Business license fees are not the only levies that apply to home businesses . In many places a gross receipts tax is charged , one that covers not just profit but all revenue . And there are other ways to increase local revenues . In Colorado , for example , a homeowner who converts a couple of rooms into business space may receive a higher property tax bill . That 's because commercial real estate is taxed at three times the rate of residences . <p> Across the country , municipal tax officials say that they often encounter hostility from home-business owners . Many of them assert that they are exempt from taxes because they work from their homes ; indeed , a group of Hollywood screenwriters is making that argument now in Federal court . <p> Nationwide , about 20.7 million households , or one in five , engage in some form of home business , according to surveys by IDC/Link , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent increase from the estimated 14.2 million households in 1990 , said Raymond L. Boggs , the firm 's director of home office research . <p> The survey is consistent with what municipal tax officials from Santa Monica , Calif. , to Roanoke , Va. , have discovered . They report that 20 percent to 50 percent of the new business licenses they issue these days are for home businesses . <p> Mr. Boggs said that about 13 million households rely on a home business as their primary source of income , averaging $80,000 in gross receipts annually . There are also about 9 million households with a part-time home business with average receipts of $10,000 , he said . The number of full-time and part-time businesses is greater than the total , he said , because some households operate more than one enterprise at home . <p> Home businesses are flourishing across the country . In Tacoma there are 14,000 registered businesses . Of those , 3,280 operate out of homes , up from 795 just three years ago , according to Duston J. Jensen , Tacoma 's tax manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has earned him the admiration of municipal tax and business license officials across the country . <p> The home businesses bring the city $400,000 in annual revenue , or more than $2 a resident , money that Mr. Jensen said " helps us keep down taxes on all the other businesses . " <p> Many of those businesses are found through the aggressive tactics of Mr. Jensen , who is so proud of his position that he drives around with a personalized license plate that reads , " TAXMAN1 . " <p> Not every city is as successful as Tacoma . For instance , Minneapolis , with twice the population of Tacoma , has licensed only 12,000 businesses , said James Moncur , the director of licensing there . It is probably missing hundreds  --  if not thousands  --  of home businesses , experts said . <p> Indeed , simply locating these businesses can be extraordinarily difficult . " When a home-based business relies on brain power married to a computer , telephone and a fax , " said Deborah Crowder , revenue manager for Asheville , N.C. , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can find them . " <p> Mr. Jensen , Ms. Crowder and others use data that the Internal Revenue Service shares with some of the states . City officials are not permitted to obtain financial data on individual Federal taxpayers , but they are entitled to the name , address and the industrial classification code for a taxpayer 's line of business . <p> The I.R.S. data , however , cover only the limited category of sole proprietorships , or Schedule C businesses , and not another type , known as Subchapter S corporations , which are often used by doctors , lawyers and other professionals . <p> The latest I.R.S. report shows that in 1995 the number of Schedule C 's  --  the Federal income tax form used by most home-based businesses  --  was 16.4 million , up 11 percent from 1990 . These sole proprietorships had net income of $169.3 billion in 1995 , up nearly 20 percent from 1990 . The average proprietorship took in more than $10,000 . <p> Meanwhile , the number of Subchapter S corporations rose more than 13 percent from 1992 to 1994 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> How many home-based businesses evade the taxman 's gaze , however , is a big unknown . Because many home-based businesses are paid in cash , or by customers who are not required to report the transactions to the Government , many of these businesses operate under the Government 's tax radar . <p> When they do find home-based businesses , municipal tax officials say , the owners often resist submitting to regulation , licensing and taxing out of a mistaken belief that they are exempt from rules that apply to all business . <p> " People who work out of their homes think they are n't required to have business licenses , " said Marsha Compton Fielder , the revenue commissioner for Roanoke , Va . She started to recount the abusive responses of some people who are told to get a license , but then paused and said , " Some are nicer than others . " <p> The most widely known fight against such municipal licensing is taking place in Los Angeles , where lawsuits have been brought against the city by a group of screenwriters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinance , which had prohibited nearly all home-based businesses , to allow those that are quiet and operate indoors . <p> The Screenwriters Guild and some journalists ' organizations contend that the city is trying to license writers , in violation of the First Amendment . The screenwriters also contend that the city can not tax them on revenue from their creative work . <p> The tax , while small , could have a significant impact on some successful freelancers . Los Angeles wants to impose a tax , for instance , of $5,900 on a $1 million payment for a screenplay . <p> " People believe there is an escape mechanism for them , " said Larry Brockman , the president of the American Home Business Association , a Salt Lake City marketing company that operates seminars and sells services to people who want to set up their own businesses at home . <p> " We tell people that they have to conform , have to get business licenses , " Mr. Brockman said , " but the deeper symptom is that Americans are angry about the taxes they pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But of course , they are not . " <p> Mr. Jensen , the Tacoma tax official , said he was not surprised that efforts to collect a tax on long-established but untaxed business activity provoked litigation . <p> " The key is to build a tax into the trend early , rather than trying to apply a tax later when there will be much more resistance , " he said . <p> The overall licensing and taxing policies of Los Angeles are driving people in creative businesses , especially those connected to software and the Internet , into the suburbs around Los Angeles , said Joel Kotkin , a senior fellow at the Pepperdine Institute for Public Policy in Malibu , Calif . <p> Communities surrounding Los Angeles , like Culver City and Burbank , " have thriving Information Age economies because they do not behave like the City of Los Angeles , a metropolitan area which has more writers than any other place in the world , " Mr. Kotkin said . <p> Judy Carter , a comedy writer , said that to avoid the tax , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second home , in Big Bear , Calif . " Officially , " she said , " I 'm not funny in Los Angeles . " <p> Raising taxes , but not enough so that home-business owners are tempted to move , drives the policies of many cities . One subtle way to raise a little extra money , as Tacoma has found , is to impose multiple taxes at very low rates . <p> While the Comroes must have two licenses for their clock business , their friends , Woodroe and Marjorie Grinstead had to pay for three . The Grinsteads ' Action Cycles , a motorcycle engine rebuilding business that they run in a shop behind their home , requires a general business licese , a home-business license and a speciality license for garages . They pay the minimum for all three licenses , a total of $172 a year . <p> " The principle the city follows , " Mrs. Grinstead said , " seems to be to tax the little businesses because they are the least equipped to fight back . " <p> Fees like those imposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Babson College in Wellesley , Mass. , " are n't going to make any difference to how many people start businesses or succeed in them . " <p> " What these business owners do want , " added Professor Reynolds , who has studied small businesses for 15 years , " is simplicity and not having to take a lot of time from what they are doing and waste it on compliance with tax laws . " <p> Teri Comroe , the clock repair owner , agreed : " Fighting the city over $50 a year is n't worth our time .
