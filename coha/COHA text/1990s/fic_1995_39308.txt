" WHAT kind of man do you want me to look for ? " Ma asks when we 're walking . " You 'll have to rely on me to find the right one ; your father has no idea . " <p> This is her favorite subject these days . <p> " Not a man like Father , " I tell her . " Not a man with a synagogue that no one needs , and who walks around not knowing what day it is . " <p> " No ; I would n't wish on anyone a man like your father , " Ma agrees . " You need iron nerves to live with a man like your father . Mine are shattered . But what did I know ? I liked him . Girls today are smarter . They know more . " <p> Liked or loved ? The Yiddish word for like is the same as for love . I wonder , is there a difference ? <p> I say , " I need someone who gets things done , someone who 's on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Lebowitz . In that family , it 's just the opposite . Mrs. Lebowitz is the slow one . Her husband is always quick , quick . The way I am . " <p> " I do n't want someone exactly like Mr. Lebowitz ; just lively like him . " <p> " You 're right , " Ma says . " Your husband should have a head like your father and should be geshikt like Mr. Lebowitz . " <p> I do n't answer . I can think of better heads than Father 's . Heads that work more thoroughly , clearly . Heads that do n't care about hasidic dynasties . Heads too involved in Torah to worry about what people say . <p> Ma looks at me . " What , you do n't think your father has a good head ? " <p> " It 's not that , " I say slowly , carefully . " I just do n't want someone like Father . I want a plain person , not a hasidic rabbi . " <p> Ma shakes her head . " Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's what he told the shadkhan . He says the first one is most important . The first marriage sets the pattern for the others . " <p> " The shadkhan ? " I say . " You mean you spoke to a shadkhan ! I told you I 'm not interested until after I graduate . I wo n't even hear of anyone before then . " <p> " I know , I know . But it does n't hurt to start feeling around . Graduation is not so far away . Chayie Brecher is already engaged . Soon there 'll be others in your class . " <p> " Chayie is an orphan . She needs a home . She does n't count . " <p> " The shadkhan called Father , " Ma says . " It 's better that they call than that we should have to call them . This way you know someone put him up to it . Someone 's interested . " She looks at me . " Do n't you wonder who ? " <p> Her eyes sparkle . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a married daughter ; she 's excited about having a married daughter and a son-in-law . With David right after me , she 'll soon have a daughter-in-law too . Then Leah will get married ; and still there will be Levi , Sarah , Aaron , and Esther . <p> " No , I 'm not interested , " I say . " I told you already . I want to teach for at least a year before getting married . I 've said this at least ten times . Why did n't you tell Father to say that to the shadkhan ? " <p> She waves her hand , making nothing I say matter . " There 's no reason to say it . Let the shadkhan do his work . A year goes quickly . I was n't supposed to tell you . Father said not to mention it . Maybe he was right . You go for your interview and get the job . We 'll take care of things . " <p> " What , and surprise me one day when I come home ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You better not pull any shtick like that . " <p> Ma laughs . " Who said anything about a boy coming to see you ? It 's all talk now . The boys are n't lining up at your door . Do n't worry . You 're not so desirable . The shadkhan said there are rumors that you 're modern ; he asked what kind of stockings you wear . Father convinced him you wear the thickest seams , nothing see-through . Do n't worry . It wo n't go so smoothly , it wo n't be one-two-three . " <p> She knows how to go from one side to the other with just a snap of her fingers . First a compliment , then an insult . I do n't trust Father . I think he 's planning to pull something off . He wants to hurry me into marriage before I know what 's what . I 'm only a daughter , and not one who will bring honor to this family . He wants to get to David . For David he can choose from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a long , straight gray-flannel skirt , and my black shoe-boots to my interview with Rabbi Nathan . He tells me he has two grades for me , second and sixth . He wants every teacher to teach one grade in the morning and the other in the afternoon , a full day . I was looking forward to half-days off , but I agree to teach both . There 'll be a few meetings before the summer , he says . Before everyone goes away . This will be his first year in this school , too , he says , so everything will be as new to him as to me . We 'll learn about the place together , he says . <p> I like him . He smokes a pipe , and every time he starts to talk , he fumbles , almost drops it , trying to take it out . Sometimes he leaves it in and talks out of the side of his mouth . <p> He says there will be two other English teachers , both a year older than I am , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Based on their experience , he says , their salaries will be higher . <p> " You do n't drive , do you ? I can pick you up and bring you back , since I 'll be driving there anyway . The first teachers ' meeting is two weeks away . The other principal wants to meet us ; we 're what they call the goyishe staff . " He laughs . " I understand you know more about these hasidic people than I do . Perhaps you can help me out . " <p> We do n't shake hands at the end of the interview , even though it seems as if we should . I smile , and he walks me to the door of his house . I walk down the stairs stiffly , like a teacher , and , at the bottom , turn and see him still standing there , chewing on the end of his pipe watching me . He waves . " See you in two weeks , " he says . <p> I walk home wondering whether he shook the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , knowing who Father is . People always act as if I am like Father . It is expected that I will be what my parents are . <p> At home , everyone surrounds me at the kitchen table . Father strokes my cheek the way he did when I was little . He 's happy to have me teaching in a hasidic school , even if it 's only English subjects . " Teaching is the most honored , the highest profession in the world , " he says . " It 's the job of every mother . A child learns his first lessons , his first words , even , from his mother . " <p> I 'm not sure I like Father being so proud . I tell him two girls from modern Beth Yaakov are teaching with me . He nods , not caring . He 's thinking about what he can say to the shadkhan : my daughter teaches al the best hasidic school in the world . <p> Seeing Father happy pleases Ma . Leah 's excited about my becoming a teacher , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulls her finger out of her mouth long enough to say , " Imagine if one day you become my teacher . " <p> " It could happen , " Ma says . " If Rachel likes teaching , she can continue doing it after she 's married . Even after she has a baby . Nowadays young women work after their first baby . They get a baby-sitter . It 's better than staying home all day , cleaning and cooking . Laundry can wait . Besides , with a husband who studies , the money has to come from somewhere . " <p> All this talk about me married , me with babies . As if I 'm already engaged . As if it 's all happening tomorrow . Right now I have a history test to study for . I have still to graduate high school . <p> THE shadkhan calls back and tells Father people inform him I do not wear stockings with seams . That I 've never worn seams . Father says , " I see her every morning and evening . She 's wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know what they 're saying . " <p> Ma looks at me , into me , seeing what I do n't want her to see . She walks behind Father and beckons me into the hallway . <p> " Tell me the truth , once and for all . What do you wear ! " <p> I do n't answer . <p> " Listen , it 's too late to change anyway . Your reputation is your own . But do n't make fools of your parents . Do n't have them saying one thing when people know another . " <p> " I wear what I want to wear . What I feel comfortable wearing . I do n't wear seams . " <p> Ma takes a deep breath . " So you do n't wear seams . Do you at least wear thick stockings , stockings you ca n't see through ? " <p> I nod . " Yes , I wear opaque beige and taupe stockings . " <p> Ma leaves the room . I open my stocking drawer . She wo n't find anything there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see two old pairs of opaque tights without seams . Maybe she 's already seen them . <p> Father comes into the room and closes the door behind him . He sits on the bed . <p> " Again you did n't listen to your father . For years now you 've been walking around wearing what you want and not what your father wants . " <p> " I told you then , I 'll never wear stockings with of seams . You want stockings with seams , you wear them . " Having to tell him this makes me angry . I 'm trembling . Why should a daughter wear what her father wants her to wear ? <p> He does n't answer . He sits for a moment , not saying anything , and then gets up slowly and walks to the door . Before he closes the door , he turns back and says , " I 'm very proud of David . The shadkhan tells me the head of his yeshiva wants him for a son-in-law . " <p> So that 's why Father 's in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , I wear opaque panty hose over my sheer . I do n't have to make believe I 'm wearing seams anymore . The double layer , opaque over sheer , makes my stockings look even thicker and Ma 's satisfied . <p> She advises Father . " Tell the shadkhan it was your mistake . That it 's your wife who wears the seams . You 're a man ; what do you know about what girls wear ? Tell him she wears thick , modest stockings . No seams . Tell him the girls here do n't wear seams . " <p> Father keeps his head down . " Who 'd want to marry a girl who lies to her own parents , tell me . We 'll have to be satisfied with whatever comes . The first that comes . " <p> Ma looks at me , bites her lip , and wrings her hands , to show me how bad things are . I do n't stay to listen . I ca n't stand this constant talk about whom I 'll marry . No matter what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't care whom I marry . Once married , I at least wo n't have to worry about it . Married , I 'll do and wear what I want . I 'll be who I am . <p> IT 'S October . I walk in from teaching . Ma says , " The Sklars are breaking a plate tonight . Elke called to invite us . " <p> I sit on my bed . There were only sixteen girls in my graduating class , but every month there 's another party or wedding . And with it comes all the well-wishing : God willing , soon we 'll be celebrating yours . <p> Should I say , Not ever , God willing ? That would cause a scandal , and then it might be never . I do n't know what I want . <p> " You do n't want to be one of the last ones , " Ma says , " Like that Landau girl . Who knows how her children will be ? " <p> Henna Landau waited too long , people say . First her twin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picky . The shadkhan stopped calling . Soon she turned twenty-six and had little choice . She married the only normal one in the Rosenbaum family . <p> " What about the girls I teach with ? They 're still single . " <p> " So you 're comparing yourself to them now , " Ma says . " They come from modern homes . They wait longer . And remember David . We 're not going to let Rabbi Blau 's daughter go , waiting for you . <p> David 's not yet seventeen , and already his engagement is all set . They 're just waiting for me . Only David knows nothing about it . <p> Father says , " There 's no need to tell a yeshiva boy . Why disturb his studies ? If we tell him , he 'll get nervous , lose sleep . Without sleep , he wo n't study . <p> I wonder if David knows anything about girls and babies . About sex . Do boys in yeshiva tall about anything ? " <p> Ma says , " If we marry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As if you do n't have enough . The shadkhan keeps saying to forget about a rabbi 's son for you . " <p> " This is why you have to be careful of your reputation , " Father says , pulling his beard so hard it is no wonder it 's thin . " The Talmud says a father has a responsibility : he must give his daughter to a scholar and to a good family . It does n't say anything about a daughter who 's given herself a reputation , a daughter who 's made things impossible for her father , a daughter who 's better known to strangers than to her own father . " <p> He speaks of me the way the prophets speak of whores . As if I 've walked the streets , invited men into my bed . <p> I talk to Ma privately . " I do n't need a rabbi 's son . I want someone who 'll work and earn a living . I do n't want to be poor all my life . " <p> She says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you want him to go off to work ? Like some coarse factory worker ? Let him study for a few years . Then , after two or three children , I can understand . I also wanted your father to get a real job , bring in a salary . But not right away . " <p> There 's a lot to be said for reputations . My reputation will help the shadkhan find someone for me , not for Father . How else would he know whom to bring ? <p> Ma says , " Elke 's groom is no big deal . He 's no great scholar , and his father is n't either . They 're plain workers and always will be . " <p> Father would never say this , but he thinks it , he agrees . He and Ma work together , they 're a team , with Ma as the bad tongue , as if it 's more seemly coming from a woman . <p> There are advantages to coming from a regular family , like Elke 's . She 's free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the community , to live for what people think and say . And they have a regular income . Her father works for a living ; they do n't have to count pennies , or depend like Father on book sales and donations . They do n't have to wait for the mail , to see if there will be enough to pay for groceries . I do n't want gifts all my life . Giving feels better than getting . The Midrash says those who give , love . A wife gives to her husband and grows to love him . A mother gives life to her children and loves them . Takers never learn to love . <p> During the party , Elke takes me into her bedroom to show me what she 's already bought . She 's been shopping mostly in Brooklyn , where the groom is from . She shows me a Christian Dior set of sheets I 've seen before , orange flowers on a white background . And towels to match . She also bought a set of white eyelet linens . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everyone gets married with four sets these days . " <p> The best thing about being engaged is shopping . A bride gets everything new , like starting life all over again . Elke 's room is full of bags . I do n't think I 'll get as much . <p> " Did you see him ? " she asks . <p> " Yes . He 's so tall , and he 's handsome . " What I do n't say is that he 's not romantic . Maybe a man with a beard , a hasidic man , can never be . <p> Elke smiles and does n't say anything . She 's in love with this man she just met , like love at first sight . Will it happen to me ? <p> On the floor is a box containing the Sanyo vacuum cleaner Ma told me about . Elke opens the box to show me . It 's a new design , beige and very shiny . Very Japanese . It looks too clean to clean with . <p> " It 's the lightest vacuum in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " It is light , " I say . " My mother would like it . Instead of that heavy blue Electrolux she drags around . " <p> " I think your mother wants it for you , not for herself , " Elke says . She opens the door to her room , still carrying the vacuum , and beckons Ma over . I look at her , a bride dressed in pale-peach chiffon , carrying a shiny beige vacuum cleaner . <p> Ma takes it from Elke and raises it , using one hand . " It is very pretty . And light . Like a toy . Will it last ? " <p> Elke nods . " It has a two-year warranty , and it 's only $110 . On special . " She turns to me . You should get one now . Before it goes up . " <p> I do n't answer . Elke looks toward Ma , as if I am too young to understand . <p> " I 'll call King 's Appliances and order it , " Ma says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the floor in my closet . Ma paid for it out of her own money . I open it and imagine cleaning my own , very clean apartment . Elke found a place a few blocks away , and she 's starting to decorate it . I helped her paint a coffeepot pattern on the kitchen walls one night . It was fun . <p> Ma 's excited . She wants to start buying things and making trips to the city . She says to use my money for clothes and linens , and she and Father will pay for the rest . <p> " I 'm not engaged yet , remember ? " <p> " You could be . Father talked to the shadkhan yesterday . " <p> " About what ? " <p> " What do you mean , about what ? About a boy . For you . " <p> " I do n't want a boy . I want a man . " <p> Ma laughs . " You know what I mean . Anyway , how could he be a man , at your age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little older . His name is Israel Mittelman . " <p> I look at her . <p> " He 's already twenty-one . " <p> " What 's wrong with him ? " <p> " Nothing . He 's twenty-one . You just said you want a man , yes ? " <p> Who wants to marry a boy ? But asking for a man is as good as agreeing to see one . I hear Father on the phone . They 're setting something up , and I 'm letting them . It 's Elke 's apartment . I 'm beginning to want things of my own . I want to live on my own . Married is the only way I can be on my own . I have to become Mrs. Someone , Mrs. Mittelman . I try the name out on paper , Mrs. Rachel Mittelman . That 's not bad . I want to fall in love , like Elke , like a woman in a novel . <p> IT 'S all set up for Saturday night at eight . The Mittelmans live in Brooklyn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sundown . <p> " Everyone says the best things about this young man , " Father says . " And the family : I know the father way back from Romania ; he 's a good man , and the family has always had an excellent reputation . " <p> For Father , knowing the family makes up for their not being rabbinical . <p> I 'm trying not to show my excitement . I do n't want to seem eager , but I am . I 'll finally find out what it 's like , meeting a man . Ma 's excited too . <p> I act as if it 's no big deal . " I 'm only meeting him . I 'm not getting engaged . " <p> " What if you really like him ? You 'll say no ? " Ma asks . <p> " Everyone gets married , " Leah says every time we talk about it . " Then you can leave the dishes in the sink all day . When I 'm married , we can do things together , go shopping without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What ? You 'd rather live with Ma and Father forever ? " <p> We 've talked about this so much , we sound like broken records . What she says is true ; I ca n't live here forever . Still , I need her persuasion . I want to be , I let myself be , persuaded . I thought I 'd never get married . That I 'd just move into my own house and live by myself . But that ca n't happen . <p> " Seventeen-year-old girls do n't go and live by themselves , " Leah says . <p> " But why not ? " I ask . " Why ca n't I just do what I want ? " <p> " You know that 's not possible , " Leah says . " You always want what 's impossible . Concentrate on what you can get . " <p> She plans to marry a wealthy boy from Brooklyn and wear designer clothes and high heels . This is the country , and people here look it . Leah wants to be like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so lightly you can hardly tell . I am sick of lightly . <p> MA TALKS about nothing else all Shabbat . She and I go for our walk after eating , and she 's mostly too out of breath to talk . We just walk . We get along better now that I 'm out of school . Maybe because I 'm older . She bought me a white silk blouse with French cuffs , and on Friday we had to go and buy cuff links at the Men 's Store . No one in our family has ever worn cuff links . <p> On our way back we slow down and Ma says , " I 'll call Mrs. Fogel . She can send us some fine embroidered tablecloths and napkins from Montreal . Like mine . It 's cheaper there . " <p> " I 'm not engaged yet , Ma . I 'm just seeing someone . And only the first one . " <p> " How many do you think girls see ? Ten ? Twenty ? " <p> " Ten is a lot more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It does n't matter . You 'll need tablecloths someday . And you 'll need some nice clothes . It 's a good thing you 've got some money saved . " <p> Ma 's so excited about tonight , about having a married daughter , I finally just let her be . I 'm starting to believe I 'll just get married , that this is it , that Israel Mittleman 's the one . <p> At sundown , Leah and Sarah offer to do the dishes and clean up so I can go right into the shower . I blow-dry my hair , straight , shoulder-length , with bangs . I put on my new blouse and a navy wool skirt . Ma helps with the cuff links . She 's wearing her green wool dress with a matching print silk kerchief . <p> Ma hurries Leah , Sarah , Esther , and Aaron out to a cab . They 're going to 99 Lanes on Route 59 . No one 's told Ma yet that bowling is modern . We took her there once , and she swung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , even though she 'd never before held a bowling ball in her hand . She and Leah have always been great at sports . <p> THE Mittelman family arrives five minutes after eight . The grandmother and an aunt too . As if we 're having an engagement party . Ma leads them to the table in the dining room , and we all sit . Israel sits near Father . I can see him without looking straight at him . He is thin and well-groomed . His beard is perfectly combed . He wears a black hat like Father 's . And a good wool suit coat , better than Father 's . His hands are on the edge of the table , only his fingertips show , and they 're pink with pressure . I can tell he 's very nervous , and I feel sorry for him . I wonder if he 's seen any other girls . It 's harder to be the man , I think . He has to start talking . <p> There 's a silver bowl filled with fruit on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his regular place , at the head of the table . He peels a tangerine and serves it to Mr. Mittelman . Ma quarters an apple and passes it to Mrs. Mittelman . They talk about the one-and-a-half-hour ride from Brooklyn . There 's no bus home tonight , so they 're staying over with their friends , the Kleins from Klein 's Fruit . <p> " Do you know them ? Do you buy your fruits and vegetables there ? " Mrs. Mittelman asks . Ma nods . " For the most part . " <p> She looks at me and bites her lip . We 're both thinking the same thing . Too many people know about this . These meetings should be kept secret until both sides are agreed and an engagement is announced . The Mittelmans should have rented a car or taken a taxi . <p> Mrs. Mittelman asks about my teaching . She says one of my students is a relative of theirs , Gitty Loeb . <p> So the Loebs know , too . <p> During a moment of silence , Ma says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes . " <p> THEY make a lot of noise pushing their chairs back . Ma 's the last one out , and before she shuts the door , she smiles and winks . I wait for Israel to speak . I wo n't be the first one . <p> " What do you do ? " he asks . His teeth are perfectly white . <p> " I teach the second and sixth grades . " <p> " What do you teach them ? " <p> " All subjects taught in English : math , literature , history , science . " <p> " Would you prefer teaching religious subjects ? " he asks . <p> " No . There are plenty of girls who are good at that . I 'm good at English ; I like literature . " <p> It would help my reputation if I taught Jewish subjects . I know this is something the Mittelmans have discussed . The shadkhan called to ask Ma about it . I was sitting at the kitchen table with her , listening . <p> Ma rolled her eyes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she likes to read , like her father . No matter how many Yiddish books we had in the house , there were never enough . For a while , my husband even considered teaching her some Talmud , but they say women should n't . Anyway , it ca n't hurt to marry a smart girl ; think of the children . " <p> The way Ma talked , anyone would have thought she 'd supported my reading all along . <p> Israel and I are talking as if neither one of us has heard anything about the other . It 's all so set up . His lips , I notice , are very pink . Not like my thick brown lips . He has small features , a small nose , and thin lips , unlike mine . He 's quiet , and I realize it 's my turn to speak . <p> " Which yeshiva do you go to ? " <p> " I 'm not in yeshiva anymore . I study with the older men , in the synagogue . " <p> I should 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age . Most boys get married at eighteen . I ca n't ask , Why did you wait so long ? " Do you like being out of yeshiva ? " <p> He nods , I wait for more , for a reason . He does n't say anything . <p> " Why ? What 's good about it ? " I ask . <p> He says slowly , " I like not having to report to anyone and not being tested every week . I like coming and going like an adult . " I watch his mouth , the way his mustache spreads so straight and black above his lips . <p> He mentions Gitty Loeb , who told his mother about the games I have them play in class to help them memorize . He says , " Tell me the rules of the game . " <p> I explain the rules of Go Fish and Twister for learning body parts and colors . <p> He smiles . " Where do you get such good ideas " " From Teacher 's Magazine . I subscribe . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I know he says this to flatter me . Still , it works ; I am flattered . <p> We talk about our families . He has two brothers and one sister . He tells me his youngest brother slipped and told a friend about tonight . Before they left home the phone rang . It was the boy 's mother , calling to wish the Mittelmans a mazel tov . Israel laughs . <p> I do n't think it 's funny . I do n't even smile . He 's too sure of tonight . Who said anything about getting engaged ? <p> We actually talk about the weather . <p> Then we 're both quiet for what seems like forever , and I push my chair back slightly as a sign that our meeting is over . <p> He gets up too . I walk into the kitchen , and he goes down the hall , to the boys ' room , which today serves as a living room . <p> I find Ma behind the kitchen door ; she 's been listening in . <p> " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Well , what ? " <p> " Is it a yes or a no ? " <p> " I do n't know . " <p> " You ca n't send them home like that , not knowing . They came all this way . Especially the old grandmother . " <p> " She should n't have come , " I say . <p> " You ca n't blame her . She 's old ; she wants to be at her first grandchild 's engagement . They 're expecting to break a plate tonight . " <p> Father walks in . " Nu ? What do you say ? " <p> " She does n't know , " Ma says . <p> " That 's not saying no , " Father says . <p> " I 'm not giving an answer tonight , " I announce in a loud voice so the Mittelmans will hear . " I need time . Send them home . " <p> " Shhh , " Ma says and closes the door . " We can wait till tomorrow , " Father says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her not to push too hard . " But you 'll have to decide by tomorrow . " <p> I say good-night to the Mittelmans and to Israel , and just as they 're finally leaving , Leah and the kids arrive home . Sarah and Aaron are arguing loudly about who 's better at bowling . <p> Leah comes in . " He looks OK , " she says . " Skinny but kind of cute . Not manly . A little like Father , do n't you think ? Did you say yes ? " <p> In books , the men are always tall and dark , or tall , strong , and blond . Not at all like Israel . He does look like Father , thin and sensitive . His hair is black , too . But his face is pale , unlike Father 's brown skin . <p> " That 's what I fell in love with , " Ma always says . " His dark skin like a Yemenite . " <p> AFTER the Mittlemans are gone , Father prods again , " Nu ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much , or I 'll just say no . " <p> " What do n't you like about him ? " Father asks . <p> " Nothing . There 's nothing wrong with him . He 's fine . " <p> " Do you still want to see another boy ? " Ma asks . " Even though it wo n't look good for you to say no to the Mittelmans . Too many people know about this . And if you see someone else , you 'll have to say yes . " <p> " And meet another whole family ? Mothers and grandmothers ? Why did they have to bring the grandmother ? It 's embarrassing . " <p> " There 's no need to meet another family . Make this one the one . God sent you this family , a good family , " Father says , smiling and trying to catch my eye . <p> I do n't smile back , and look away . He 's worse than Ma . He does n't want to give me any choice . He wants this to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm in control . But I do n't know what I want . Saying no to the Mittelmans would mean that I 'd have to say yes to the next one . And who knows who the next boy will be . By then the Mittelmans will be insulted . Or Israel will get engaged to someone else . He 's older than most boys ; his parents want him to get married . <p> And if I say no to the next one , people will say I refuse boys for no reason , like the Adler girl . Everyone was saying , Who does she think she is , a princess ? She finally married a boy who 'd been turned down by at least ten girls because he 's short and fat . Serves her right , people said . About me , they 'd say worse . <p> I EXPECT some sign from God all night . I do n't deserve it , only the most virtuous people can hope for that , but still I expect it . I fall asleep imagining being held and kissed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't remember any dreams ; there 's nothing to tell me what to do . But I 'm excited . I try to imagine Israel in bed with me and ca n't . He 's not the type . I wonder how he would start . How does anyone start such things ? <p> In the kitchen Ma 's at the counter . Father 's in the synagogue . The others are in school . " Should I see another man ? " I ask her . <p> " Not if you like Israel . After your father , I refused to see anyone else . There was a Belgian boy , from a wealthy family , and I said no because I 'd already made up my mind to marry your father . " <p> Ma had an opportunity to marry a Belgian boy , a foreigner . I 'm seeing someone from regular old Brooklyn , even if he is from fancy Borough Park . " Do you think you made the right choice ? " I ask . <p> She looks at me , surprised . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what a beautiful family I have . Do you know how many women envy me all this ? " <p> " What about all your complaints ? You used to complain a lot . About not having enough money . About being a rabbi 's wife . " <p> She waves her hand , making none of that matter , and sips her coffee . " Those first years were hard ; it was a hard life . Feeding , clothing , and educating seven of you . " <p> " You might have had it easier with a wealthy Belgian husband . " <p> Ma sips and swallows . " I love your father . " <p> FATHER comes home , and we eat breakfast together . We both dunk our bread in the soft-boiled egg yolk . Ma started a new diet today ; she 's had her wheat germ and milk already , and now she 's on her second cup of coffee . She wants to fit into her raw-silk dress for the engagement party . She wants to look as good as thin Mrs. Mittelman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top . Ma can never look as good in the kerchief she wears . When I 'm married I 'm expected to wear a wig with a hat , like Mrs. Mittelman . Father says why not do even better , wear what your mother wears . He does n't know that after I 'm married , when he and Ma ca n't tell me what to do , I wo n't even wear the hat . <p> Ma knows . She says , " Let her wear a covered wig , and at least you 'll know she 'll stay with it . Not change after . Like Borough Park girls . They 're more concerned with how they look than with God or their parents . It 's hard to believe that after their first night with their husband they can be so hard , so unchanged , so concerned with just looks . " <p> As if sex with a man is supposed to make you better , softer , more religious . Ma thinks that after I 'm married I 'll start wearing seams if Israel asks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Plenty of girls do . They 're in love with their husband , and he just has to ask them at the right moment and they do it . A smart boy asks right after the first night ; it 's the best time to get the girl to agree . " <p> I plan not to change one bit . I do n't even want to wear a wig . I think if all women refused to shave and cover their heads , the rabbis would have to rethink the laws , change them . But I do n't know anyone who agrees with me . <p> Leah says , " That 's ridiculous . It will never happen . " <p> When I talk to Elke , she says , " I do n't mind shaving my hair . Everyone does it . You should be happy to get rid of yours . You 're always complaining about how fine it is . " <p> " I talked to Mr. Mittelman in the synagogue this morning , " Father says . " He 's very understanding . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , we can break the plate and they can take the four- or six-o'clock bus home . He says he understands a young girl wanting to be more certain . " <p> I like Mr. Mittelman for understanding . Still , what is there I could see better the second time around ? You do n't get to know a person sitting at a table and talking or going out on a date . It takes time . It takes forgetting that you 're doing it . <p> Father looks at me . " So what do you say to a second time ? " <p> " What for ? " I say . " What else is there to see ? " <p> He smiles and looks satisfied . He knows I 'm interested . He reaches over and puts his hand on top of mine and says , " Then make this second meeting the engagement . " <p> I CALL Elke 's house . Her mother says she 's at her new apartment . <p> I walk over . She 's painting the woodwork in the bathroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch . <p> " Are you at all nervous , Elke ? " <p> She puts her head to the side . <p> " I mean , how did you know he was the one you wanted ? He was the only one you saw . " <p> " I just did , " Elke says . " He 's good-looking . And he was funny when we talked . And I knew I did n't want him to see any other girls . " <p> Things seem so easy for her . I 'm too serious . Elke would have laughed with Israel about the phone call before he left home , she would 've thought it funny . <p> She sits back with the brush in her hand and leans against the sink . " It 's not the newest thing in the world , you know . People get engaged and married . It 's not such a big deal . Just do it . We 'll have fun being newlyweds . " <p> " What about love ? " <p> " It comes after . Everyone I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You think too modern , " she says . " You always did . You always did things that were too modern for your family . Too modern even for the most modern girls in our class . And you 're from a rebbishe family . Everyone in school talked about it . Even Leah thinks so . She says you just never know when to stop , that you have no limits . " <p> I think it 's easier for Elke because she does n't think about love in novels . She hates reading . She does n't know any tall , dark men in boots . She thinks only about the hasidic way , real life . For the first time , I see a reason not to read . <p> I say , " It 's not as if I 'm about to get engaged . I 'm just thinking about seeing him again . " <p> " That 's getting engaged , in hasidic families . It happens very quickly . One day you meet , the next day you 're engaged . Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to do it sooner or later anyway . " <p> Elke is always ahead , a veteran . I used to think things would be different for me . That my life would be different . But it is n't . I teach grade school like all the others . I 'll get engaged like all the others . Get married . Maybe it 's better doing things the way everyone does . You know exactly how it goes . Besides , I do n't even know what I really want to do that 's different . Or what there is to do . Even modern girls get married eventually . They just do it later . They go out on dates instead of sitting in . Then they get engaged and married . I thought there 'd be more things a person could do , more choices . But there 's nothing else . People get married and start living their own lives . Married is the only way to live on my own , in my own apartment . <p> At four , Israel comes again . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's even changed his shirt . This time , only his father is with him . The women are waiting at the Kleins ' . Maybe Ma said something . <p> We talk . Today he looks into my eyes , and I notice his deep-blue eyes . They 're beautiful . I do n't know how I missed them last night . I ask him where he wants to live . We 're looking at each other . I can see myself in his eyes , and I think maybe this is love . <p> He answers slowly . " Wherever you decide . " <p> I wish his answer were more definite , a name , Borough Park . I want him to take me away to another city . I want him to be strong , a man in a novel . He is n't . But his mind is made up about one thing : he wants to be engaged to me . My reputation is n't stopping him . My hesitation , seeing him a second time , has n't upset him . Maybe it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a rabbinical family . <p> " I think I want to live in Borough Park , " I tell him . " Somewhere different . " <p> He nods . " We can . But for the summer , we should rent an apartment here . The city empties out in the summer . My parents move out to the country . It 's not very nice there in the hot summer . " <p> I think that 's a good idea . I was a lifeguard last summer , and I could do it again . I could continue earning money . I tell him that , and he asks me about lifeguarding . <p> " You must swim very well , " he says , looking at me , admiring me . <p> WHEN I come into the kitchen , Ma has that question on her face , and I know I do n't want to say no , I 'm tired of saying no . I do n't wait for her to ask . I decide to trust her . I can trust her more than Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ask . <p> She nods . <p> " OK , yes , " I say , thinking how easy it is to say it . Yes , yes , yes . There 's nothing else to say when you say yes . <p> Ma kisses me on the cheek and calls Father . <p> He kisses me on the forehead . Mr. Mittelman telephones his wife . I call Elke , and she quickly comes over . <p> Ma brings out the chipped china plate she 's been saving for me , her first daughter , and wraps it in a dish towel . For some reason , we 're all standing in the kitchen . <p> When Mrs. Mittelman , the grandmother , and Mr. and Mrs. Klein arrive , Ma hands the plate to the old lady as an honor . She looks around slowly and lifts her hands up as if she 's too close to the ground . A plate that does n't break is a bad omen . If it does n't break , I think it will be a sign from God . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor , and we hear it shatter . Everyone says mazel tov . The fathers shake hands , the mothers kiss . The Mittelmans kiss their son . The grandmother kisses her grandson , my future husband , Israel . I watch how he bends down to help her reach him . Elke hugs me . The phone rings . Everyone arrives home from school , and Leah and Sarah take turns answering and making calls . Mrs. Mittelman also gets on the phone . Aaron and Esther are underfoot . <p> Esther wants to know if I 'm going to have a baby now . Elke explains that it takes a while . Listening to her , I remember David and Levi in yeshiva . They know nothing about this . I send Aaron to tell Leah to call them . She 's so excited , she 's calling everyone she can think of . Leah looks at me from across the room and points to her watch to indicate it 's not the right time to call . They have set hours for everything there . I wonder how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait until after my wedding . I 'm almost eighteen . David is already seventeen , and Father says a boy should be under the wedding canopy before he 's eighteen . <p> Ma unties the dish towel and hands everyone a piece of the plate . She saves the largest piece , a piece from the center , for me . It has three tiny pink flowers . Mrs. Mittelman asks if I want it set in gold as a necklace charm . We look at my piece of the plate . It 's large enough for a round or oval setting . All the brides in Brooklyn are doing it now , she says . I give it to her , and she puts it in her fancy black purse with a long strap , like younger women wear , not like Ma 's old-lady bag with handles . <p> Ma tells Mrs. Mittelman my ring size is five . For my engagement party , I will receive a diamond ring and a big silver vase filled with roses . That 's what Elke got . Bridal gifts conform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differ . Receiving fewer or cheaper gifts could be taken as an insult . As a bride , I can expect a gift for every holiday that comes up between now and my wedding . I do n't care about any of this , but Ma says to keep my mouth shut . She received a pearl instead of a diamond ring , and she will never let anyone forget it . Grandfather said it was because he 'd seen dirt under her fingernails . <p> " A complete lie , " Ma says . " Can you imagine me with dirty fingernails ? He just needed an excuse , that stingy old man . " <p> Ma and Mrs. Mittelman discuss a date for the engagement party and decide on a month from now , on a Sunday , my day off from school . Ma says we 'll do it in the new synagogue next door , the women in the women 's section and the men in theirs . She explains that things are still a little raw , construction is n't entirely finished , but it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it 's bright . <p> Before they all leave , Israel comes over , and Leah and Elke move away quickly . With his eyes lowered for modesty , he wishes me mazel tov and a good night . This is impressing Ma , I know . At the last minute , he looks into my face and smiles . I wonder if he 's thinking of what I 'm thinking . Of us kissing . Of us in bed . I ca n't imagine us together . I 'm not sure what men think about . I always knew what the women in stories felt , I could understand what they felt , but I do n't know anything about men . <p> Mr. and Mrs. Mittelman wish me a good night ; Mrs. Mittelman kisses me , then I kiss the grandmother . Mr. Mittelman bows his head and smiles . Until I 'm married , Father is the only man allowed to kiss me . Then my husband . <p> From the kitchen window , I watch them pile into Father 's car . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York City stops . Ma is at the front door , waving . It 's a starry dark night , the moon is full and round , at the beginning of her month . I 'll have to start keeping track of my month , count the days to my period and away from it . Husband and wife are allowed to touch each other only two weeks of the month . There are five to seven days of menstruating , a seven-day count of clean days , then the ritual bath . I have to find the right day for my wedding , before my period begins again . <p> In the Talmud , there are three kinds of virtuous women : girl , wife , and mother . I will be a girl for four more months . <p> PEARL ABRAHAM is a graduate of New York University 's writing program .
