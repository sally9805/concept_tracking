GOOD NEWS FROM THE BUREAU OF THE CENSUS : A SMALL BUT SIGNIFICANT CORPS OF WORKING WOMEN ARE INCHING UP TO  --  AND SURPASSING THEIR SPOUSES IN INCOME . BUT INSTEAD OF BREAKING OUT THE MOET &; CHANDON , AMERICAN COUPLES ARE BREAKING INTO A SWEAT . THEY 'RE DISCOVERING THAT IT PUTS A HELL OF A STRESS ON THE RELATIONSHIP . IF THEY DO N'T SUCCUMB TO SQUABBLING AND BLAMING EACH OTHER , IT MAY BE BECAUSE SHE IS CONCEALING GOOD FINANCIAL NEWS . Although Ozzie and Harriet have long since died as icons of our intimate arrangements , the notion that they symbolized  --  that it 's a husband 's duty to bring home the bacon  --  lives on , quite subversively , deep inside our heads . Typically , it resides there outside of awareness , having been absorbed from the culture before we ever gave much thought to gender roles  --  although it shapes our individual identities as men and women . So when she brings home the bacon , family dynamics may take a turn for the worse over injured identities and gender-role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least , the effort to replace economics with a new glue for the relationship can take what feels like endless negotiation . In extreme cases , couples may end up sacrificing their relationship to attitudes both partners openly condemn . In the traditional order of things , money brought with it the authority  --  recognized by both partners  --  of he who had it to exercise power . In the changing order of things , everything symbolized by money  --  value , status , power , and the potential for independence  --  becomes a hidden issue in the household when money switches gender . This is not a matter quietly swept under the cultural rug much longer . Seven million American women earned more than their mates in 1993 , up from five million in 1987 . Last year , a very substantial 22.3 percent of all working wives outearned their husbands  --  an achievement all the more remarkable since women overall make about 70 cents to the male dollar . The uppermost echelon of women in corporate America have seen their salaries double over the past 10 years , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet only 69 percent of the female movers and shakers at major U.S. corporations are married , versus 91 percent of males . Sure , getting to the top requires a sacrifice of time that might otherwise be spent cultivating intimate relationships ; what 's not clear is how much of the marriage gap reflects relationship difficulties high-earning women face just because of their salaries . Among those who marry , female executives now pull in 66 percent of their household income . But all families increasingly rely on the woman 's paycheck to keep the household humming . Layoffs , the high cost of living , medical expenses , falling male wages , the desire for a better lifestyle , and assorted other economic factors have made dual-income families a reality for 59 percent of married couples in the United States . Working women report that their ability to bring home a paycheck increases feelings of power , improves self-esteem , and gives them fulfillment and independence . But they also sense that society as a whole has yet to embrace female earning power as a positive . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clinton , Zoe Baird , and other women whose high earnings have been well publicized . SOCIETY AND STEREOTYPES THERE 1S A CULTURAL STEREOTYPE THAT A POWERFUL WOMAN IS less feminine , desirable , and attractive than one who is n't , " says Cloe Madanes , marriage therapist , and author of The Secret Meaning of Money : How It Binds Together Families in Love , Envy , Compassion or Anger ( Jossey Bass , 1994 ) . " While a successful male is lauded for his achievements , the successful woman fears losing the love of her spouse , of her children , and of her parents if she appears too financially strong . Heaven forbid she earn more than her husband  --  or worse , her father . " " The societal norm still says there is something wrong with man if a woman is making more money , " says psychologist Dorothy Cantor , Psy.D. , coauthor of Women and Power : The Secrets of Leadership ( Houghton Mifflin , 1992 ) . " But as more couples earn equal pay , the gap will begin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " MANGLED MASCULINITY PART OF THE PROBLEM LIES WITH MEN . WORKING WOMEN HAVE reconstructed the definition of womanhood , says Ronald Levant , Ed.D. , a marriage and family therapist in Belmont , Massachusetts , who also teaches at Harvard Medical School . But " men have been slower to respond to the change in women 's roles , in part because it challenges the notions of male privilege and entitlement . Males are n't ready to give up their advantage in terms of earnings and social power . " The idea of women having the upper hand in any way , he says , threatens traditional male identity . " He feels less of a man  --  even though he would rather not feel this way , " adds Barry Dym , Ph.D. , a family psychologist in Cambridge , Massachusetts. , detailing the confusing calculus of cultural roles . " It violates the imagery we have of ourselves as providers . " The traditional measure of a man  --  the model we 're still working from  --  is what he achieves in the world , which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he makes . " Money is so charged in American culture , " says Dym. " it 's our only reckoning of status . People are more willing to talk to me about their sex life than they are about their income . " When she earns more , he feels unimportant . And often anxious , sensing that the marriage itself is threatened , as though the old premise of the relationship no longer applies because she does n't need the protection of his earning power . He now has to invent for himself a new platform on which to base the relationship . It takes a very mature male  --  in sense of self or in age , though they often go together  --  to feel comfortable with a higher-earning spouse , reports Lori Gordon , Ph.D. , a marriage and family therapist in Falls Church , Virginia , and founder of PAIRS , a pioneering course in relationships taught by specially trained therapists around the country . More typically , a man begins to compare himself to his wife . And that brings with it the tendency to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partner as " the opponent . " He finds fault with her to feel better about himself . " This is a special danger for men who are still trying to " make it " in the world of work , because they 're typically in a highly competitive mode . That 's not to say there are n't younger men who are starting out with a completely different model of relationships . " But generally , men make comparisons in ways that women are not aware , " says Gordon . If a man is not secure enough , Cantor adds , he may act hostile  --  without directly attributing his anger to his wife 's earning power . " If he does n't openly sabotage his wife 's success through an affair or other assault , he may do it in more subtle ways , like refusing to do his share of housework or child care . " The psychological backlash takes many guises when a man lacks an appropriate response to his spouse 's success , such as offering congratulations or support . Unfortunately , Levant explains , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And they are confused about how to be supportive and accepting of women 's new roles without jeopardizing masculinity and traditional ideals . " FEMALE IN-FIGHTING IT 'S HARD ENOUGH THAT A MAN 'S SENSE OF SELF CAN BE THROWN into disarray when a wife outearns him . But the woman 's identity may also be shaken . Women face not only confusion and resistance , if not rebellion , from their partners  --  but a deep struggle within themselves . " The female partner also is not pleased about earning more , " reports Dym . " She 's angry . She feels exploited . She 's bitter . She feels he should be earning more . Of course , this is not at a rational level . " As a measure of the complexity of money issues , high-earning women may also harbor feelings of guilt . And if it does n't arise within them , it 's often thrust upon them by outsiders  --  parents , friends , coworkers . It can take extraordinary psychological fortitude to withstand the conclusion that one is undermining all of society . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplishments . Many assume a patently disproportionate share of domestic responsibilities , taking on what sociologist Arlie Hochschild calls a " second shift . " Muses Cantor : " Here I am , a respected therapist who sits on the board of the American Psychological Association , and in the midst of this interview about just how far women have come , I 'm switching the laundry . " BATTLE ACTS THE UPHEAVAL IN MALE IDENTITY HELPS EXPLAIN WHY FINANcially successful women often go to great lengths to downplay their salaries . " It 's an attempt to conform to the belief that women are born to be homemakers , " says Cantor . " His sense of self has to come from something other than his relative position to his wife . He should ask , " Why should my earning power be what defines me ? Am I not valuable as a friend , citizen , partner ? ' ' " Dym has too often seen couples caught in the battle of the bucks . " This speaks to very unstated issues of power , but money gives a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live , how to live , how money is spent . When the woman earns more , both partners are ambivalent about female power . They try to hide it . It is almost a shared secret , but it sneaks out . She can be relentless in her criticism . She 's mad at him for not earning enough and she tries to make him better : " You 're not professional enough . ' " If you 'd only dress this way ... ' He is furious , and he plays out his sense of loss of power by being resistant . They usually fight most about what she wants him to do . She feels abandoned . He withdraws . And she feels betrayed . " Of course , a high-earning partner has always been free to choose to share power . But it is not easy for even the best-intentioned of couples to escape the powerful field of gravity that cultural stereotypes still exert . " To be at the edge of change is difficult , " observes Elana Katz , M.S.W. , a family therapist at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least three generations for cultural changes to become reflexive , intuitively familiar . As a result , there is dissonance between our automatic response and our thinking response , and it is most evident at times of stress . " Nonetheless , marital counselors report an evolution in men 's attitudes toward female earning power over the past decade . " More and more , I 'm hearing from men who want to marry a woman who is ambitious , strong , and independent , " Madanes says . " Many have been through divorce and are tired of being cast in the role of provider . Once a man knows what it feels like to share the financial responsibilities , he 's not likely to want to shoulder the burden on his own . " The philosophy that the male must be the dominant figure financially and in every other way dies harder in some ethnic groups more than others . " In the early Seventies , " recalls Madanes , " I saw a lot of Italian-American men in my practice who thought that if their wives worked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ONE THERE ARE GROUPS WITHIN OUR SOCIETY  --  NAMELY AFRICAN Americans  --  and cultures outside it where gender roles are played very differently than they are in the idealized model . From these , all couples would do well to learn a great lesson : It is necessary to establish each partner 's worth on a scale that does not equate money with license or power . " Both partners are going to have to reframe each other 's worth as individuals , not as wage earners , " says Madanes . The key is for couples to view each partner 's contribution to the relationship as valuable , whether it be child care or career  --  regardless of the monetary value attached to it . " There needs to be a shift in consciousness , " emphasizes Gordon . " Money is not the measure of a person 's worth . It 's their value as a human being . " Otherwise , the marriage can become a hotbed of competition , as it did for Jenny and Bob Michael . Jenny is now 45 and runs her own management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their careers as coworkers ; but after they planned to marry , she decided to switch to another part of the company . " Every job available was a higher-grade , officer-level position . Then I learned that my career was moving along fine while Bob 's was n't . I did n't want to bruise his ego , so I reasoned , " If I can do it here , I can go anywhere : and said to Bob , " Let 's shop around for another location to start our family . " Then she was the first to get hired for a new job , which left Bob to assume " the wife 's role " of selling the house and arranging the move . It took Bob , an aggressive M.B.A . graduate of Wharton , six months to land a position . " It got to the point where I was n't telling him about raises or any of the perks associated with my new job because I did n't want to make him feel bad , " Jenny recalls . " But it got harder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he noticed an increase on my pay stub , I 'd act like it was no big deal , but each deposit was a reminder that I was doing better than he was . " He never mentioned my promotions to his family or celebrated my raises . Now I see that was because he saw my success as a poor reflection on him , rather than a triumph for us as a couple . " Jenny was relieved when Bob was finally offered a post as a vice president at a major bank . " In his mind , he had reached some level of status . He played the VP role to the hilt  --  including having an affair . " Unfortunately , Jenny says , " image became more important to him than his marriage or his new baby on the way . " They separated . Then Bob sued for  --  and won  --  half of Jenny 's pension and savings . He later remarried a lower-level professional with whom , Jenny says , he does n't have to compete . Looking back , Jenny sees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to do with what I had accomplished versus what Bob had . It finally dawned on me that he was in competition and that he was n't winning . " LESSON NUMBER TWO THAT BRINGS UP LESSON NUMBER TWO : SEE THE MARRIAGE AS common ground on which both partners have equal standing and play as a team . Whether it 's household income or the tasks of home , relationship , or life-at-large  --  which may be divvied up differently at different times , depending on interests and opportunities  --  both partners should feel that they are contributing to a common pot in which they have an equal stake . They have to look upon themselves as collaborators . " Unfortunately , " says Elana Katz , " we know more about how to do complementary relationships , based on differences , than how to create symmetrical relationships . It usually involves a lot more negotiation . And negotiation is hard work  --  a lot harder than staying resentful . " One of many ironies of modern relationship life , observes Katz , is that negotiation works only when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But it is much harder to negotiate as equals . " One of the dearest decisions must be about sharing money : what 's joint . Commonly , says Gordon , " when a man is the high earner , what 's his becomes theirs . His resources are shared by the two of them . But then , when she becomes the high earner of the couple , what 's hers remains hers and she doles out the money as he is forced to become dependent . " Finding and emphasizing common ground can , by itself , help the money issue move into the background , " though it will come up and bite a couple periodically , " notes Dym . " A couple needs ground where they have common values and issues of power are not central . They may value children . They may like sex together  --  the pleasures of which they can recover once they stop fighting . " LESSON NUMBER THREE A COROLLARY STRATEGY FOR MAKING the outearning experience work is for both partners to openly discuss marital roles : It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same vision of the partnership and to discuss problems as they arise . " If one partner is uncomfortable with the arrangements , " says Cantor , " it 's much better to talk about it rather than hold it in and build up resentment . " The trick is to set up a time when neither partner is stressed , upset , or tired . And then both must take a vow of honest communication and consciously expose and fight their own outdated stereotypes . Kathleen Pritchard , 34 , is a Manhattan-based corporate trainer for Essex Corporation , and her earning power helped her marriage get off to a healthy tart . As a sales manager for a large financial company , she was earning $80,000 to her husband $$50,000 . He was n't complaining . In fact , Jeff , a manager at GTE Airfone , joked that he had " married well . " He says , " I was proud of her , and I thought it was great . We 're a team , so the more money she brought in , the better our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both extended families were supportive . " I really did n't have to overcome any turmoil over Kathy 's salary , " Jeff says . Though Kathleen 's salary helped make possible a wedding , a house purchase , and a kitchen renovation , she did n't want money to become her main focus . " My value system was getting skewed to where I cared more about money than about happiness , " she recalls . When she decided to switch to a lesser-paying job she would enjoy more , Jeff offered encouragement . " Not because I was threatened by the idea of her making a killing , " he says , " but because it 's no fun to have a wife who is miserable in a 14-hour-a-day job . " Kathleen says : " Working is a large part of my identity , and I would n't want to give it up . Plus , I never expected a man to support me . I learned early that if I wanted something , I would have to go out and get it myself . " The Pritchards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outset that the woman 's career path is more likely to offer maximum benefits , money , or security , fare well  --  better than those hit with an unexpected hardship , like a heart attack or layoff , that forces the woman into the role of the breadwinner . FREE TO BE HE TOO , A WOMAN 'S HIGHER-PAYING JOB IS more readily accepted by her spouse if it enables him to pursue a career that offers prestige , artistic value , or a social contribution in lieu of financial rewards . Arnie Burr , 40 , a professional musician in Chicago , says he could never have followed his dream of performing were it not for his wife 's high-paying job at a multimedia corporation . " We both know that Susan 's job allows me the freedom to work in an unpredictable and unprofitable field , " Burr says . " I just hope she does n't turn around one day and resent me in some way . " Peggy Goodfellow , 37 , and husband , Pat , 32 , epitomize the new Nineties approach  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spouse with the greatest earnings potential or benefits generally heads to the office , while the other partner manages the household . Gender does n't factor into the equation . When they married , Pat was still in law school ; Peggy was a social worker in a hospital and had excellent medical insurance . When Peggy became pregnant with the first of their three sons , the couple decided that she would keep her job and that Pat , who had n't found a job in the law profession , would stay at home . " People thought it was odd at first , " Peggy says . " They kept asking , " When is Pat going to get a job ? ' It was a touchy subject for Pat , but we let people know that we believed it was a very good thing to have one of us with the kids , as opposed to bringing in an outside caregiver , and that person happened to be Pat . " Initially , she adds , " Pat had a hard time thinking of it as our money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own . " But over time , he 's come to view his work with the kids as a valuable contribution , and the money issue just worked itself out . " A HEX ON SEX ? NOT THAT IT ALWAYS DOES , MARITAL experts see a causal link , under certain conditions , between a wife 's income and the couple 's sexual performance . If a husband feels secure about himself , his wife 's achievements can only add to a fulfilling relationship both inside and outside of the bedroom . But if either partner uses money as a power tool , they 're in for trouble . " A man may feel castrated if he 's not in the traditional male provider 's role , " Madanes says . " Similarly , a woman may not feel as attracted to her mate if he 's not as successful as she is . " Some men are likely to experience problems , Levant adds , because " men are limited in their emotional responses to anger and lust . They do n't know how to express themselves when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Massachusetts psychologist reports that these days , " I see in my practice an increase in the number of men who are reporting impotence and loss of sexual desire because they do n't know how to behave anymore . " So when more money begins adding up to less love , what 's a couple to do ? The single most important advice , experts conclude , is to borrow a trick from therapists . " In therapy , we reframe a person 's worth , " stresses Madanes . " Our job is to help partners see each other 's worth as a people , not for what they make . " <p>
