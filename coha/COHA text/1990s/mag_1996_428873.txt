A Eloise Doxie Dixon , director of counseling and wellness at Xavier University , says women tend to socialize by sitting and eating while men participate in physical activities like sports , helping them to lose weight faster than their female counterparts . // Everybody wants to be thin . But as hard as both sexes are working at it , men still have an easier time than women shedding those unwanted pounds . And there are several reasons why . One reason is most men have more muscles than women . Experts on the issue say that because men have more muscle mass than women , those muscles burn more calories while at rest . The rate at which one 's muscles burn calories while at rest is called the basal metabolic rate . The higher the basal metabolic rate , the easier it is for someone to burn calories and lose weight . " When they go on a diet , they just seem to automatically lose weight , " said Eloise Doxie Dixon , director of counseling and wellness at Xavier University in New Orleans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose weight faster than women is that they have less body fat . Everyone has to maintain a certain amount of body fat . But the more fat , the harder it is to shed pounds . Women , on average , have a higher body fat percentage than men . Any amount up to 25 percent is a normal body fat level for women while any amount up to 13 percent is considered normal for men . The location and types of fat play a role in weight loss as well . Men usually have higher levels of visceral fat , which is located around the organs , in the abdominal area , explains Lisa Giannetto , medical director of the Duke University Diet and Fitness Center in Durham , NC . This fat is easier to lose . Women , however , have more subcutaneous fat , which is located right up under the skin in locations like the hips and thighs . It 's harder to lose . On average , Dr. Giannetto says , a man can lose between 20-30 pounds within a 30-day time period while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only lose 15-20 pounds . // Experts reveal men tend to gain ( visceral ) fat around their abdomens , while women gain ( subcutaneous ) fat on their hips and thighs . The subcutaneous fat is harder to lose . // In addition , sex hormones are also instrumental in body fat retention , Dr. Giannetto says . Both men and women have the hormone testosterone , but men have more . Both sexes have the hormone estrogen , but women have more which allows them to bear children , but also contributes to the retention of body fat , doctors say . " More estrogen allows us to do really good things like keep the world going by having babies , " says Gayle McCray , health educator , personal trainer and program coordinator for cancer prevention awareness program at the Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta . " If we did n't have the propensity to store fat around the hips , our chance of getting pregnant would be less . It 's a wonderful difference .

Photograph A Dr. John Flack , associate director and medical director of the Hypertension Center at the Bowman Gray School of Medicine , notes that Black women overall have a low level of physical activity . // Dr. John Flack , associate director and medical director of the Hypertension Center at the Bowman Gray School of Medicine in Winston-Salem , NC , agrees . He says that because estrogen contributes to the amount of body fat women retain , and it 's harder to lose fat than muscle , it is logical that women wo n't shed pounds faster than men . These hormonal changes begin to happen during adolescence , adds Dr. John Patrickson , associate professor of neurobiology at Morehouse School of Medicine . During that time when men are developing more muscle mass , women are getting more fat deposits , which prepares their bodies for child bearing . Overall physical fitness also determines who loses weight and how much , or who does n't . Dr. Mac Buchowski , assistant professor of family and preventive medicine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the difference in physical activity between men and women is the biggest problem with women losing weight slower than men . In a study he conducted , Dr. Buchowski says he found that women spend more time doing sedentary activities-like watching televisionthan men , who he says participate in activities that require higher levels of energy . Dr. Flack adds that based on his studies , Black women tend to have the lowest level of physical activity of any major race and sex groups . Dixon says that while more women participate in the wellness programs at Xavier , more males take part in the intramural sports activities . Renee Wiggins , registered dietitian and fitness expert in Washington , D.C. , explains that while women have more fat than men , the two sexes have the same aerobic capacity , meaning their heart and lungs function about the same . So women just have to work harder than men to lose the pounds . Dixon notes the difference in the amounts of exercise that men and women perform has a lot to do with socialization . " Women will sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about additional weight , " she says . While it may seem frivolous , McCray adds , hair plays a role in why women do not exercise as much as men . Because of the fear of ruining their hairdos , some women avoid the gym , especially before work and during lunch . McCray and Dixon also say that married women get into the routine of taking care of family and children and neglect to exercise , while their husbands maintain that play mentality , always ready for a game of hoops or some other strenuous exercise . " Although these activities ( homemaking ) are important , they require less energy , " and therefore burn fewer calories McCray explains . " It 's a male thing , " Dr. Patrickson adds . Men have that " no pain no gain " mentality and are always looking for those strenuous activities to do , whether it 's playing some sport or spending a lot of time in the weight room .

Though a woman 's work is never done , she 's got to find the time to do a lot more of the aerobic kind if she wants to lose weight as fast as a man . <p>
