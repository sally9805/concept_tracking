As Europe rolls through 1992 , the long-awaited year of economic integration is beginning to look more like the year of Euro-retreat . Worried by the increasingly obvious uncompetitiveness of much of their industry , Europeans are winding up for a backlash against open markets and free trade . Expect more , not less , protection of jobs and companies . Warning : American and Japanese companies hoping to boost exports to Europe in the next few years could face new obstacles . The cause is not hard to find . From a trade surplus in 1986 , Europe ran up a record trade deficit estimated at about $110 billion last year . Japanese electronics account for more than 20% of the total . Europe 's share of its own $250 billion information technology market fell from a high of 43% in 1987 to just 20% last year . Europe is all but finished in semiconductors . In cars , analysts predict its once proud manufacturers will have just 55% of their home markets among themselves by the end of the decade , down from 65% today . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Last December members of the European Community agreed to phase in monetary union by 1999 , and all but Britain approved a common social contract calling for EC-wide standards for working hours and conditions . Of 282 proposals aimed at eliminating trade barriers , more than 210 have now been passed . Customs formalities at borders will cease by the end of this year . The problem is a sudden , nerve-rattling economic slowdown . Europe 's GNP grew just 1.2% last year , and prospects for 1992 are n't much brighter . Unemployment will remain at a worrying 9.3% this year and next , predicts the organization for Economic Cooperation and Development . Even more troubling to Western Europeans is the huge number of unemployed workers  --  and potential immigrants  --  massed just over their borders in Eastern Europe . Faced with this one-two punch , political and business leaders have become less interested in deregulation and lower prices for consumers and more worried about the jobs that might be lost as a result of further market liberalization . Warns Konrad Seitz , head of policy planning in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way they are now , Europe might be without European-owned firms in the whole field of information technology . It would be a nightmare . " After long hanging back , Germans like Seitz have begun to join in the push by the French , the Italians , and even some Britons for the following : more money for ailing European industries , more industrial collaboration and joint R &D; projects , fewer outsiders in pan-European projects , and possibly sanctions against the Japanese if their exports do n't slow down . Consider recent remarks by Eberhard von Kuenheim , chairman of BMW , a company that has successfully penetrated the Japanese car market in the past five years . The principles of free trade are no longer equally observed worldwide , he says , adding , " Through their aggressive policy of conquering markets , the Japanese have created a scenario of ruinous competition everywhere . The first people to suffer this cutthroat competition were U.S. manufacturers . " The next , he implies , will be the Europeans . In electronics , the situation looks equally grim . Says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's last independent chipmaker : " The Japanese have a track record of dominating , not cooperating . I 've nothing against their desire to conquer the world . They 'll do it nicely . But I do n't want to be conquered . " Do these men want to abandon the Treaty of Rome and return to the bad old days of protectionism ? Not exactly . Until recently , Europe 's failure to build globally competitive industries in computers , electronics , and cars was blamed on protectionistic state subsidies , clubby cartels , and import quotas . Lift all that , went the gospel at the time , and strong competition would forge a competitor worthy of Toshiba or Toyota . It did n't happen . Efforts to merge all or parts of computer makers Olivetti , Siemens , and Groupe Bull , for example , fell apart over nationalistic arguments about which country would manufacture the products and which would get the layoffs . Similar plans in the car industry also came to grief . Francis Lorentz , CEO of Bull , would like the European Community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry . " This is no different than what the U.S. Department of Defense did for years through its military budget , " he says . " I would like to make use of technology developed by Olivetti and Siemens and then compete with them . " In other industries , the high social costs of shedding workers prevents big layoffs , while strong unions in most countries keep wages rising . The political cost of replacing high-cost factories in Europe with lower-cost units in Asia remains ruinously high . Today , many European business leaders , von Kuenheim and Pistorio among them , believe the formula for creating strong Euro-companies includes a mixture of centralized industrial policy , improved productivity , and intensified pressure on competitors  --  especially the Japanese  --  to hold down exports and open up their own markets . The new thinking runs : Do n't say Concorde ( a small , troubled niche player ) when you think of state-assisted industries ; say Airbus or France 's profitable TGV rail system , both big successes . With more state and EC encouragement , according to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in their own . These views are cropping up in unexpected places . Germany 's powerful industry association , the Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie , is already modifying its rock-solid support for free trade . The association has proposed rethinking antitrust rules to ensure they do not " impede business cooperation that goes beyond the R &D; sector " and has suggested that the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) be amended to allow sanctions against the Japanese in retaliation for their impenetrable distribution networks and closed supplier agreements within Japan . At the Brussels headquarters of the European Community , the forces for more government aid to industry and less free trade are advancing steadily . The EC plans to boost sharply its direct aid to industry over the next five years , to $4.3 billion annually by 1997 . About 40% of the money will go into new research and development projects , 30% for retraining workers facing unemployment , and the rest for " trans-European " projects , such as EC-wide telecommunications networks . " Europe 's trade imbalance is reason enough to reflect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EC industrial affairs official . Adds a senior Eurocrat : " Our anticompetition rules are the strongest in the world . That 's madness . " Martin Bangemann , a German who is EC vice president for industry , brands bureaucrats who enforce strict antimerger rules as " competition ayatollahs . " One of those , Sir Leon Brittan , the EC 's vice president for competition , is even toughening up his own view . Though firmly against protectionism , Brittan now says , " I would not rule out the threat of reciprocity " in forcing Japan to open up its home market . Sir Leon blames the Japanese for the pressure he 's getting in Europe for state aid to industry . Recently he told Japanese business leaders : " Quite simply , it is the phenomenal strength of the Japanese economy and the huge success of its export effort that is at the root of much of the present questioning of economic liberalism . There is a widespread perception that the Japanese economy is not so much a friendly locomotive of world trade as a hostile steamroller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Shigeru Tsumori , until recently second in command at the Japanese Embassy in Bonn and now back in Tokyo , says he noticed a distinct cooling toward himself and colleagues by German industrialists during his two-year duty there . Says he : " I recently met the chairman of BMW , and he told me he was expressing his opinion about Japan 's high exports , not as a German or BMW executive , but as a European . " The Japanese diplomat adds : " That means he 's standing alongside auto companies in France and Italy . For us that 's not positive , because we Japanese and Germans have become strong on free trade . The French and Italians are protectionist . " If protectionism is a religion , then France is the Vatican and the top cardinals are Jacques Calvet , CEO of PSA , maker of Peugeot and Citroen cars , and Alain Gomez , chief of Thomson , the state-owned French electronics giant ( see following story ) . Operating in a protected home market that is supposed to open slowly to the Japanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a profitable company with 1991 sales of $28 billion . He believes that Europe must be shielded from the Japanese because Europeans wo n't reduce their living standards just to become competitive . Says he : " The Japanese do n't resemble us . They have a feudal system , and Dr. Toyoda ( CEO of Toyota ) is a samurai of modern times . The Japanese can destroy a large part of our industrial fabric and destroy us socially and economically . If we truly want to compete , it 's not a question of technology or technique . We 're looking at a change in living standards and in our kind of civilizalion . " Calvet argues that free trade is possible only between countries that resemble each other . Barriers on Japanese imports , he says , should remain until Japan changes its ways or Europe abandons its lifestyle . Says he : " Either Europeans work like the Japanese , more than 2,000 hours a year instead of 1,700 , and with a two-week holiday , not five , or else the Japanese will have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It could be said this is the shameful position of protectionism , but we are running an enormous risk of breaking up a social fabric it has taken us a long time to create . If our politicians do n't realize that , then in the near future there will be violence and civil strife in Europe . " Many of Calvet 's French colleagues dismiss him as an extremist , but as far as the European car industry goes , analysts tend to support his worst fears . Euromotor Reports , an automotive research group in London , states that if the EC continues with its plan to remove all restrictions on car imports by 1999 , only Volkswagen among European makers is a sure bet to survive , with either Renault or Fiat likely to collapse or be bought or merged . But other analysts say even Volkswagen has not been able to get its costs low enough to avoid losses during a downturn . To become competitive , European automakers will have to make widespread job cuts . Says Robert Eaton , who ran GM 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CEO-designate : " The U.S. was the automotive battleground of the 1980s . Europe will be that battleground in the 1990s . " An American auto executive based in Germany , who asked not to be named , believes that Europe wo n't let the worst happen . " Europeans in general are far more pragmatic than Americans . They wo n't allow the blood bath that 's happened in the U.S. to happen here . They do n't believe in the free market that much . " Garel Rhys , auto expert and professor at the University of Wales , offers this forecast of how things will play out . " The French , Italian , and German carmakers will press so much that the EC will have to allow state aid and probably vigorous control over the number of cars brought into Europe and the number of plants built here , " he says . This kind of intervention will lead to higher prices for consumers , but Rhys reckons that European buyers will swallow 10% to 15% price increases for the sake of preserving jobs and companies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most Old World industrialists believe it will take another ten years at least until they can get their businesses productive enough to take on the Japanese and the Americans in open European markets , so on January 1 , 1993 , you can expect celebrations for a unified Europe . But for at least a decade after that , expect more , not less , protection of European industry . <p>
