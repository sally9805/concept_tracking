Up until now , the overriding issue at U.S.-Soviet summits has been how to avert World War III . Next week 's meeting will be different . George Bush will be receiving a Soviet leader who has openly warned that his country may be heading toward civil war . That specter haunts conversations with citizens of the U.S.S.R. at many levels of society and in many parts of the country , and it ought to be an urgent item on the international agenda . <P> The festering crisis in the Baltics is only the most obvious manifestation of the problem and by no means the most alarming . The resolve of the leaders there is still tempered with restraint . That is not necessarily so in the southern republics . Speaking privately in Tbilisi two weeks ago , one of Georgia 's most popular nationalist leaders denounced as " traitors and collaborationists " any of his countrymen who participate in Soviet-approved parliamentary elections this fall . Such epithets give off a distinct aroma of gunpowder . <P> In Moscow there is a growing awareness that the virus of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cure  --  economic prosperity and political diversity within a loose confederation  --  is still in the test-tube phase . Academicians at state-sponsored institutes are openly wondering whether breakaway Muslim areas of Central Asia will end up allied with hostile Islamic fundamentalist regimes to the south . <P> The prospect of whole republics defecting has complicated U.S.-Soviet nuclear arms-control talks . Soviet negotiators have dug in their heels at the last minute in part because the Ministry of Defense is looking to the day when it may have to compensate for lost real estate with extra missiles . " As our overall situation deteriorates , " says one official , " we have to reinforce ourselves where we have a vanguard position . " Then he adds with a thin smile , " That means the ballet and the Strategic Rocket Forces . " <P> Politicking for the presidency of the Russian Federation is now a hot topic in Moscow . Many think that post will be more important in a few years than the presidency of a fractionated U.S.S.R. More and more Russians are saying perhaps their republic should secede . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say he accepts that some shrinkage is inevitable ; he is looking for a way of making the process dignified , or at least orderly . He is also trying to buy time for the reforms he hopes will induce most of the country to remain . The rules that the Supreme Soviet has imposed for secession , however , are rigged to give the central authorities a veto over the will of the people around the periphery . The result has been to radicalize even relatively moderate nationalists . The more Gorbachev tries to slow down their departure , the more determined they are to speed it up .
