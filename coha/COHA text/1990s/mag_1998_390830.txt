Section : CHILDREN AND PC 'S ESSAY : Getting the Right Start Too much computer time too soon may be harmful <p> MY 4-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER IS A MASTER AT THE ART OF mock astonishment . I noticed this the other night while we were messing around with a popular children 's software program . She clicked on a puppy perched at the top of a set of stairs  --  the little dog promptly slid down a banister and disappeared into a large boot . She glanced sideways at me , her mouth gaping wide , her eyes twinkling . Then she giggled . That was very silly , ' she said , with far too much irony in her voice for someone who has yet to graduate from preschool . Quite silly , ' I agreed . <p> I make my living writing about computers , which encourages me to observe my daughter obsessively whenever she rests her hand on the mouse and glues her eyes to the screen . It is an iconic pose  --  there is no shortage of techno-happy philosophers who believe that today 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a new Renaissance of creativity and empowerment . I 've always scoffed at such Net generation ' hype , but it matches up too well with the edutainment ' industry 's propaganda campaign to ignore easily . What responsible parent can shrug off the injunction to give your children the best possible start in life ' ' ? Is it any wonder that the learning software ' business is a cash cow ? <p> My daughter knew how to hit the enter button by the age of 2 , and was sending me e-mail before she turned 3 . It is beyond dispute that she is headed for uncharted territory . She maneuvers a mouse more adroitly than a crayon , and her 10-month-old brother is n't far behind . <p> That disturbs me . There is a dark side to the Pollyanna hopes declaring each moment of computer interactivity ' a glorious boon . No one has proved that computers actually enhance the burgeoning of creativity or intelligence . The truth may even be the opposite  --  there 's reason to believe that prolonged exposure to computers , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain development . Not every moment in front of the computer is filled with delight  --  I 've watched my daughter slip into phases of glazed dullness , forgetting to blink , caught in endless point-and-click loops . <p> The best possible start ? Actually , I 'd rather see her in a sandbox , or building a tower out of blocks or even swapping pairs of high-heeled shoes among her Barbies , than navigating yet another two-dimensional , fancily pixelated puzzle . Sure , I enjoy hearing her giggle at each new computer trick , and I 'm plenty willing to concede that some programs are very good at achieving certain goals . But I 'm in no hurry to watch my daughter immerse herself in the digital domain . There 's time enough for that later . <p> At least I hope so . I do n't deny that guilt festers in my belly every time I collapse on the couch with my kids and watch another episode of The Simpsons ' or Dexter 's Laboratory . ' The global economy waits for no one  --  and those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge . What kind of a father am I , anyway , content to blow bubbles in the backyard rather than doing everything possible to ensure that my daughter arrives at kindergarten equipped with the programming chops necessary to debug a malfunctioning Hokey-Pokey program ? <p> After all , you could argue that I myself am exhibit A of the benefits of early computer indoctrination . While pregnant with me , my mother , then a graduate student at UC , Berkeley , took a class in the Fortran programming language . She likes to joke about it to her friends these days , now that I write about computers on a daily basis . See , she says , good prenatal care really can make a difference . Forget about hooking up your power cords  --  if you 're a really serious nerd you start with the umbilical cord ! <p> My mom the computer geek  --  I 've always been proud of the fact that her university lab is stuffed with high-powered workstations . The funny thing is , I only learned about my mother 's Fortran foray quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion on the potential impact of computers on my own kids . <p> I had just read a book , Failure to Connect , ' by the educational psychologist Jane Healy , that made a good case for the claim that normal neurological development in small children could be hampered by over-exposure to the computer . Healy 's argument is that such children gain essential experience about the world from their interaction with physical objects . My 10-month-old may stand to benefit more from bumping his head or inserting implements of destruction into his mouth than he will from staring at eye-catching animations . My daughter 's hand-eye coordination and understanding of cause and effect is better facilitated by struggling with a crayon in a three-dimensional world than by manipulating a cursor arrow through a two-dimensional space . Instead of mindlessly boosting funding for computers in the classroom , suggests Healy , we would be much better off devoting resources to music and art programs . <p> Healy 's book offers a powerful antidote to the snake-oil hucksterism of digital evangelists and learning-software retailers . But Failure to Connect ' is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survey of the use of computers in classrooms all across the United States . Healy is an accomplished educational psychologist , but she 's no brain scientist . <p> My mother , however , is . She 's a professor of neuroscience , a specialist in brain anatomy who always gives me a quizzical look when I behave inappropriately  --  as if wishing she could take my head apart and pinpoint exactly which synapse has just misfired . So I asked her : could computers warp impressionable brains ? <p> It 's possible , ' she said . But there 's no real data . ' No one would be crazy enough , she said , to conduct on kids the kind of rig-orous study ( with control groups , neurological tests , exhaustive brain scans ) necessary to come up with an answer one way or another . But there 's no question , she added , that the brain is especially malleable in very young children  --  millions of new synaptic connections between brain cells are forming all the time , and different patterns arise from different experiences . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clicking with a mouse is likely to nurture a different brain structure than a childhood spent building volcanoes in a sandbox . <p> Is one better than the other ? Authors like Douglas Rushkoff ( Playing the Future ' ' ) and Don Tapscott ( Growing Up Digital ' ' ) argue that screenagers and N-Geners ' will be better suited for the complexities and constant change of the future if they grow up familiar with multitasking computers and nonlinear , hyperlinked Webs . Do n't worry about all those hours your child spends playing Quake  --  that 's just practice for what will soon be the real world . So get that high-speed cable modem installed in the kids ' room and let ' em rip . <p> The edutainment industry thrives on this kind of credulity . There 's no time to waste  --  there are computer programs on the market now aimed at 8-month-olds ! Sigh  --  I guess my son is already a laggard . His most likely response to the sight of a computer mouse is to try and eat it . <p> It is ludicrous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logging some computer time when he hardly knows how to sit in a chair . And that 's where Healy 's case is the strongest  --  she is more than willing to acknowledge that there is an appropriate time and place for children to start banging away at keyboards , provided there is a strong parental or teaching presence . She recommends not worrying about it until the children are about 8 or 9 years old . Not only can too much exposure before that point be potentially harmful , but there 's no real evidence that the child gains any significant advantage . A motivated 8-year-old can pick up the basics very fast . Let the kids be kids . <p> My own experience as a computer user encourages me to keep my children 's hands off the mouse . You see , although I wish I could claim that my amniotic introduction to Fortran stimulated me to amazing feats of digital derring-do , I did n't actually own a computer until I turned 26 . I still had plenty of chances to geek out , early and often . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my mother . My grandfather was the first person in the family to own a personal computer  --  a Radio Shack TRS-80 , back in the late ' 70s . <p> So I was actually a member of the first generation of teenagers to encounter the personal computer  --  an ur-screenager , if you will . It 's a tragic story . There I was , hacking together silly little Basic programs one summer . Then I went off to college , and did not touch a computer for another 10 years . Meanwhile , all those other pimply-faced proto-nerds moved to Silicon Valley and earned billions of dollars . <p> There but for the grace of the go-to command could I have gone . I do n't really mind , and I doubt that my grandfather would be disappointed either . <p> If my grandfather could see my daughter now , he would be fascinated at the possibilities that the onslaught of the personal computer has opened up . My grandfather would be a major Net-head . But he 'd also wonder , as I do , why anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kitchen when there 's a real kitchen in the house . Or why one would place a child in front of a music ' program instead of at a piano . Or what real value an interactive CD-ROM storybook offers over old-fashioned pa-per and ink . <p> Good questions all  --  but there 's one obvious answer . The world does move faster today , and it is harder to keep up . Stress is high , time is short . In families like mine ( and unlike my grandfather 's ) , where both parents work , it 's very difficult to make time for kitchen activities or piano lessons . All too often , the parenting decision is boiled down to an unfor-tunate either-or cop-out . You 've got two screaming kids , you 're trying to make dinner , feed the pets and clear out the dishwasher  --  do you pop a videotape in the VCR or a CD-ROM in the computer ? <p> Most parents automatically believe that the computer is the better choice . It is , after all , interactive . And indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Internet access watch less TV as proof that civilization is actually moving forward , in spite of all the evidence to the contrary . Less Barney ! More Yahoo ! It can only be a good thing . <p> Well , maybe . After spending more time with my daughter exploring the top-selling children 's software , I 'm less willing to buy into the interactive is better ' theory . For one thing , without a parent around , there 's no telling what a 4-year-old will wind up doing . I 've seen how she falls into a common computer pitfall  --  the old infinite recursion loop : click , get the reward , go back , click , get the reward , go back . She gets bored , but she does n't know how to get out  --  she does n't even really know she needs to get out  --  all she knows is she 's bored . I 've also seen how she will opt for the easier challenge rather than the harder , how what she has already done is sometimes more attractive than what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real value to be gained from the noninteractive story format . Sometimes that television show , or videotape , offers a compelling narrative that delivers truths about the human condition , and enlightens us to something beyond the cause and effect of a point-and-click puzzle . I 'll take the movie Babe ' over the interactive version of Disney 's Little Mermaid ' any day . <p> Future generations , however , will be perplexed by the debate over which is better , the computer or the TV . I realized this when my daughter clicked her way through a computer program that aimed to teach her Spanish . There , on the screen , was a picture of a TV and VCR , along with several videocassettes . Her mission ? Drag the cassette to the VCR , click on the play button and watch the ensuing video . <p> Now , there 's the true promise of the digital revolution  --  simulated TV . To my kids , the TV , with its powerful remote control and cool split-screen possibilities , is more than just a tad interactive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and what have you got ? As we used to say when I was a kid : Same difference . ' <p> The only real difference , ultimately , is what the parent or teach-er does with the tool . My daughter loves to spend half an hour playing what she calls computer games '  --  but I 'd like to think that in part that 's because I 'm sitting right next to her , matching every one of her jaw-drops with one of my own . And if that 's the case , then why are we bothering ? Why are n't we outside , practicing riding a bike or hunting for snails ? Already , every important adult in my daughter 's life spends far too much of his or her day locked in communion with the computer screen . She needs no encouragement to know that the device is important or endless-ly interesting . Nope  --  the opposite is true . She needs to be steered away from the computer . Time is too precious to spend it with a mouse , when we could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Giving her the best possible start means , at least for now , pressing the off button . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : REALITY CHECK : The author explores the unvirtual world with daughter , Tiana , 4 and son , Eli , 10 months <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : EEK !
