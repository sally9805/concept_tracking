GET SHORTY by Elmore Leonard <P> Delacorte ; 292 pages ; $18.95 <P> When Elmore Leonard writes a thriller called Get Shorty , you know he 's going to get Shorty . Leonard does not fool around . It does occur to the reader , a couple of pages before the end of the last chapter , that no character named Shorty has yet appeared . But Leonard is our funniest and most reliable folklorist of low , middle and upper-middle lowlife  --  the kind of human lint that accumulates in society 's navel . He knows his business , does n't he ? <P> Sure he does . Shorty will turn up any moment now . In the meantime , as in all his novels , Leonard has introduced us to a few friends . Whodunit is not the issue , because almost everyone in the book is indictable for some villainy . The question is how much trouble the hero , a semiadmirable Miami loan shark named Chili Palmer , will bring down on his head by his squabble with a syndicate wide-body named Bones . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Chili 's leather jacket , and Chili , quite reasonably , punched Bones out and shot a crease in his scalp . <P> This caused Bones to become surly , and Chili , a man of peace , decides it is time to clear out of Miami . He follows a welsher to Los Angeles and , in the process of collecting some money he is owed , becomes fascinated by the movie business . He wants to direct films , of course , and he has an idea for a script about a good-looking , sympathetic loan shark . The author 's lovely , slightly malicious joke ( Leonard has worked in Hollywood ) is that among the movie town 's barracudas , electric eels and ink-ejecting squid , a loan shark fits right in . Chili clearly has a great future , despite a disagreement with his prospective film 's star , a handsome fellow of towering ego but  --  got it !  --  small stature . Finally meeting Shorty is one of the summer 's real pleasures .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
