Deserters . <p> When I ca n't see the next step , when I ca n't think clearly about the hardware changes that TOS needs in order to become the repository , the ark , the salvation of my soul , I think of deserters . <p> I think of men on the rail of a sinking tanker . For miles around , there are no lights , only water black and icy . A lake of flame surrounds the ship . Beyond the edge of the burning oil slick , a man sits in the lifeboat looking at his comrades . The angle of the deck grows steeper . The men at the rail are waving their hands , but the one in the boat does n't return . Instead , he puts his back into rowing , rowing away . To the men who still wave , who still hope , the flames seem to reach higher , but it 's really the ship coming down to meet the burning sea . <p> Or this : <p> The arctic explorer wakes from dreams of ice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sleeping bag , his frostbite has thawed and it feels as though his hands and feet are on fire . It is almost more than he can endure , but he tells himself he 's going to live . As long as his companion is fit enough to drive the sled , he 's going to live . He hobbles from the tent , squints against the sunlight . When he finds the dogs and sled gone , he watches for a long time as the wind erases the tracks . <p> In these fantasies of mine , the dead bear witness . <p> From the bottom of the sea , dead sailors wave their arms . <p> Frozen into the ice , a leathery finger points , accuses . <p> There must have been a time when I was n't aware of the relentless tick of every heartbeat , but I do n't remember it . My earliest memory is of lying awake in my bed , eyes open in the blackness , imagining what it was like to be dead . <p> I had asked my father . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this , " he said . He showed me a watch that had belonged to my grandfather , an antique watch that ran on a coiled spring instead of a battery . He wound it up . " Listen , " he said . <p> Tick , tick , tick , I heard . <p> " Our hearts are like that , " he said , handing me the watch . " At last , they stop . That 's death . " <p> " And then what ? " <p> " Then , nothing , " he told me . " Then we 're dead . We just are n't any more  --  no thought , no feeling . Gone . Nothing . " <p> He let me carry the watch around for a day . The next morning , the spring had run down . I put the watch to my ear , and heard absence , heard nothing . <p> Even back then , lying awake in the dark with my thoughts of the void , I was planning my escape . <p> Tick , tick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I was n't alone . After my graduate work in neuronics , I found a university job and plenty of projects to work on , but research is a slow business . <p> Tick , tick , tick . <p> I was in a race , and by the time I was fifty-six , I knew I was falling behind . In fact , I felt lucky to have made it that far . We were living at the height of terrorist chic . The Agrarian Underground and Monetarists were in decline , but the generation of bombers that succeeded them was ten times as active , a hundred times as random in their selection of targets . Plastique , Flame , Implosion . . . . They gave themselves rock-band names . And then there were the ordinary street criminals who would turn their splitter guns on you in the hope that your chip , once they dug it out of your skin , would show enough credit for a hit of whatever poison they craved . <p> Statistically , of course , it was n't surprising that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to CNN Four , The Street Beat Source , the barrage of just-recorded carnage made me wonder that anyone was still alive . <p> Fifty-six . That 's when I heard from Bierley 's people . And after I had met Bierley , after I had started to work with Richardson , I began to believe that I would hit my stride in time , that Death might not be quite the distance runner he 'd always been cracked up to be . <p> I had known who Bierley was , of course . Money like his bought a high profile , if you wanted it . And I had heard of Richardson . He was hot stuff in analog information . <p> Bierley and Richardson were my best hope . Bierley and Richardson were magicians at what they did . And Bierley and Richardson  --  I knew it from the start  --  were unreliable . <p> Bierley , with his money and political charm , would stay with the project only until it bored him . And Richardson , he had his own agenda . Even when we were working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never really believed . <p> In Richardson 's office , he and I watched a playback of Bierley 's press conference . It had been our press conference , too , but we had n't answered many questions . Even Richardson understood the importance of leaving that to Bierley . <p> " A multi-cameral multi-phasic analog information processor , " Bierley said again on the screen , " but we prefer to call it TOS . " He smiled warmly . " The Other Side . " <p> From behind his desk , Richardson grumbled , " God . He makes what we 've done sound like a seance . " <p> " Come on , " I said . " It 's the whole point . " <p> " Are you really so hot to live forever as a machine consciousness , if , fantasy of fantasies , it turns out to be possible ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " Your problem , " he said , pointing a finger , " is that you 're too damned scared of death to be curious about it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I almost told him he 'd feel differently in another twenty years , but then I did n't . It might not be true . Since I had a/ways seen death as the enemy , it was possible that someone like Richardson never would . <p> " Meanwhile , " Richardson continued , " we 've made a significant leap in machine intelligence . Is n't that worthy of attention in its own right without pretending that it 's a step toward a synthesized afterlife ? " <p> On the screen , Bierley was saying , " Of all the frontiers humanity has challenged , death was the one we least expected to conquer . " <p> " As if , Christ , as if we 'd already done it ! " <p> Bierley peered out from the screen . He had allowed only one video camera for the conference so that he 'd know when he was looking his viewers in the eye . " Some of you watching now will never die . That 's the promise of this research . Pioneers of the infinite ! Who does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will my grandchild 's grandchildren belike ? What lies ahead in one hundred years ? A thousand ? A million ? " After a pause and another grandfatherly smile , a whisper : " Some will live to know . " <p> Richardson blew a raspberry at the screen . <p> " All right , " I admitted . " He oversells . But that 's Bierley . Everything he says is for effect , and the effect is funding ! " <p> On the screen , the silver-haired Bierley was rephrasing questions as only he could , turning the more aggressive queries in on themselves . Was n't this a premature announcement of a breakthrough bringing hope to millions ? Would Bierley himself turn a profit from this conquest of humanity 's oldest and cruelest foe ? Would he himself be among the first to enter the possibly hazardous territory of eternity to make sure it was safe for others ? <p> Then he was introducing us , telling the reporters about my genius for hardware and Richardson 's for analog information theory . We had sixty technicians and research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a two-man show . In some ways , it was . Neither of us could be replaced , not if you wanted the same synergy . <p> " Two great minds in a race for immortality , " Bierley said , and then he gave them a version of what I 'd told Bierley myself : Richardson was always two steps ahead of my designs , seeing applications that exceeded my intentions , making me run to keep up with him and propose new structures that would then propel him another two steps beyond me . I 'd never worked with anyone who stimulated me in that way , who made me leap and stretch . It felt like flying . <p> What Bierley did n't say was that often we 'd dash from thought to thought and finally look down to see empty air beneath us . Usually we discovered impracticalities in the wilder things we dreamed up together . Only rarely did we find ourselves standing breathless on solid ground , looking back at the flawless bridge we had just built . Of course , when that happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I worried that Richardson was indispensable , that after making those conceptual leaps with him , I could never go back to my solitary plodding or to working with minds less electric than his . All minds were less electric than his , at least when he was at his best . The only difficulty was keeping him from straying into the Big Questions . <p> The camera had pulled back , and Richardson and I both looked rumpled and plain next to Bierley 's polish . On screen I stammered and adjusted my glasses as I answered a question . <p> Richardson was no longer watching the press conference video , but had shifted his gaze to the flatscreen on his office wall . It showed a weather satellite image of the western hemisphere , time lapsed so that the last 72 hours rolled by in three minutes . It was always running in Richardson 's office , the only decoration there , unless you counted that little statue , the souvenir from India that he kept on his desk . <p> On the press conference tape , Richardson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any idea how we 'd actually get a person 's consciousness into the machine , " he admitted . " We have n't even perfected the artificial mind that we 've built . There 's one significant glitch that keeps shutting us down for hours at a time . " <p> At that point , Bierley 's smile looked forced , but only for an instant . <p> " The best way to explain the problem , " the recorded Richardson continued , " is to tell you that thoughts move through our hardware in patterns that are analogous to weather . Sometimes an information structure builds up like a tropical depression . If conditions are right , it becomes a hurricane . The processor continues to work , but at greatly reduced efficiency until the storm passes . So we 're blacked out sometimes . We ca n't talk to . . . " He paused , looking at Bierley , sort of wincing , " . . . to TOS , until the hurricane has spent its energy . " <p> " You do n't like the name , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snorted . " The Other Side . " He leaned back in his chair . " You 're right about the money , though . He charms the bucks out of Congress , and that 's not easy these days . " <p> On the tape , I was telling the reporters about the warning lights I had rigged in the I/O room : They ran up a scale from Small Craft Advisory to Gale Warning to Hurricane , with the appropriate nautical flags painted onto the display . I had hoped for a bigger laugh than I got . <p> " Can we interview the computer ? " a reporter asked . <p> I had started to say something about how the I/O was n't up to that yet , but that TOS itself was helping to design an appropriate interface to make itself as easy to talk to as any human being . <p> Bierley 's image stepped forward in front of mine . " TOS is not a computer , " he said . " Let 's make this clear . TOS is an information structure for machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and manipulate digital data , but this is an analog machine . Eventually , it will be a repository for human consciousness . If you want another name for it , you could call it a Mind Bank . " <p> " No one gets it , " Richardson said , " and this press conference is n't going to help . " He looked at me . " You do n't get it , do you , Maas ? " <p> " I do n't even know what you 're talking about . " <p> " Trying to synthesize self-awareness is an interesting project . And putting human consciousness into a box would be a neat trick , instructive . I mean , I 'm all for trying even if we fail . I expect to fail . Even if we succeed , even if we find a technical answer , it begs the bigger question . " <p> " Which is ? " <p> " What does it mean to live ? What does it mean to die ? Until you get a satisfactory answer to that , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " The point is that I do n't want to die ! " Then more quietly , I said , " Do you ? " <p> Richardson did n't look at me . He picked up the Indian statue from his desk and leaned back in his chair to look at it . When he put it down again , he still had n't answered . <p> The statue was a man dancing inside an arc of flames . <p> The next week , Bierley deserted us . <p> " Brain aneurism in his sleep , " one of the old man 's attorneys told me via video link . <p> There had been no provision in Bierley 's will to keep seed money coming . If he went first , we were on our own . The attorney zapped me a copy of the will so I could see for myself . <p> " Makes you think , " the attorney said , " does n't it ? " He meant the sudden death . I thought about that , of course . As strong as ever , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tick , tick . But I was also thinking something else : <p> Bastard . Deserter . <p> He had left me to die . <p> Weeks later in the I/O room , I said to Richardson , " We 're in trouble . " <p> He and a technician had been fiddling with TOS 's voice , and he said , " TOS , what do you think of that ? " <p> " I do n't know what to think of it , " said the machine voice . The tone was as meaningfully modulated as any human voice , but there was still something artificial about the sound  --  too artificial , still , for press exposure . " I do n't know enough of what Dr. Maas means by ' trouble . ' I 'm unsure of just how inclusive ' we ' is intended to be . " <p> " My bet , " Richardson said , " is that he 's going to say our project has funding shortfalls up the yaya . " <p> " Yaya ? " said TOS . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A pause . " I understand . " <p> Richardson grinned at me . " English as she is spoke . " <p> I waved off his joke . " There 's talk of cutting our funding in Congress . I 've been calling the reps that were in Bierley 's pocket , but I ca n't talk to these people . Not like he could . And I sure as hell ca n't start a grass-roots ground swell . " <p> " How about that lobbyist we hired ? " <p> " She 's great at phoning , full of enthusiasm , to tell me how bad things are . She says she 's doing her best . " I dropped into a chair . " Damn Bierley for dying . " And for taking us with him , I thought . Did n't those bastards in Washington understand what the stakes were here ? This was n't basic science that you could throw away when budgets were tight . This was life and death ! <p> Tick , tick , tick . <p> My life . My death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> " Plenty . " <p> " Good . " Richardson smiled . " I have a desperation play . " <p> We played it close to the edge . Our funding was cut in a House vote , saved by the Senate , and lost again in conference committee . Two weeks later , we also lost an accountant who said he would n't go to jail for us , but by then we had figured out that the best way to float digital requisition forms and kite electronic funds transfers was with TOS . We could n't stay ahead of the numbers forever , but TOS , with near-human guile and digital speed , bought us an extra week or two while the team from Hollywood installed the new imaging hardware . <p> The technicians and research assistants kept TOS busy with new data to absorb , to think about , and I worked to add " rooms " to the multi-cameral memory , trying to give TOS the ability to suppress the information hurricanes that still shut us down at unpredictable intervals . The first rooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ processing , pattern recognition , memory sorting  --  but these new ones were basically just memory modules . Meanwhile , Richardson paraded people who had known Bierley through the I/O room for interviews with TOS . <p> The day of the press conference , I deflected half a dozen calls from the Government Accounting Office . Even as the first reporters were filing into our press room , I kept expecting some suits and crewcuts to barge in , flash badges , and say , " FBI . " <p> I also worried about hurricanes , but TOS 's storm warning lights stayed off all morning , and the only surprise of the press conference was the one Richardson and I had planned . While stragglers were still filing into the room  --  security-screening and bomb-sniffing that many people took some time  --  the video behind the podium flicked on . <p> " Bierley , regrettably , is dead , " said Bierley 's image . He was responding to the first question after his prepared statement . " There 's no bringing him back , and I regret that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " But you 're his memories ? " asked a reporter . <p> " Not in the sense that you mean it , " Bierley said . " Nobody dumped Bierley 's mind into a machine . We ca n't do that . " Dramatic pause . " Yet . " Smile . " What I am is a personality construct of other people 's memories . Over one hundred of Bierley 's closest associates were interviewed by TOS . Their impressions of Bierley , specific examples of things he had said and done , along with digital recordings of the man in action , were processed to create me . I may not be Jackson Bierley as he saw himself , but I 'm Jackson Bierley as he was seen by others . " <p> Bierley chose another reporter by name . <p> The reporter looked around herself , then at the screen . " Can you see me ? " she said . " Can you see this room ? " <p> " There 's a micro camera , " said the image , " top and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he flashed the grandfatherly Bierley smile "  --  that 's a wasted question . You must have had a harder one in mind . " <p> " Just this , " she said . " Are you self-aware ? " <p> " I certainly seem to be , do n't I ? " said the image . " There 's liable to be some debate about that . I 'm no expert , so I 'll leave the final answer up to Doctors Maas and Richardson . But my opinion is that , no , I am not self-aware . " <p> A ripple of laughter from the reporters who appreciated paradox . <p> " How do we know , " said a man who had n't laughed , " that this is n't some kind of fake ? " <p> " How do you know I 'm not some incredibly talented actor who 's wearing undetectable makeup and who studied Jackson Bierley 's every move for years in order to be this convincing ? " Undetectably , unless you were looking for it , Bierley 's pupils dilated a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ openness . We had seen the real Bierley do that in recorded addresses . " I guess you have to make up your own mind . " <p> Then he blinked . He smiled . Jackson Bierley did n't intend to make a fool of anyone , not even a rude reporter . <p> " What does Bierley 's family think of all this ? " asked someone else . <p> " You could ask them . I can tell you that they cooperated  --  they were among those interviewed by TOS . They have me back to an extent . I 'll be here to meet those great-great grandchildren I so longed to greet one day . Unfortunately . . . " and suddenly he looked sad . " Unfortunately , those kids will know Bierley , but Bierley wo n't know them . Only much more research can hold out the promise that one day , a construct like me really will be self-aware , will remember , will be the man or woman whose life he or she extends into eternity . " <p> He did n't mention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclusive use of his image , any more than Bierley himself would have mentioned it . <p> " Are the Bierleys funding this project ? " <p> " I know a billion sounds like a lot of money , but when it 's divided up among as many heirs as I have . . . " He paused , letting the laughter die . " No . They are not . This project is more expensive than you can imagine . In the long run , it 's going to take moon-shot money to get eternity up and running . " <p> " And where 's that money going to come from , now that your federal funds have been cut off ? " <p> " Well , I ca n't really say much about that . But I 'll tell you that it will be much easier for me to learn Japanese or Malay as a construct than it would have been for the real Jackson Bierley . " He smiled , but there was a brief tremor to the smile , and it did n't take a genius to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one American who did n't want to hand yet another technological advantage across the Pacific . <p> " In these times , it 's understandable that the American taxpayer wants his money spent on hiring police , " Bierley went on . " Why think about eternal life when you 're worried about getting home from work alive ? It 's too bad that both ca n't be a priority . Of course , with the appropriate hardware attached , a machine like TOS could be one hell of a security system  --  a very smart guard who never sleeps . " As if a TOS system could one day be in everyone 's home . <p> Richardson and I stepped to the podium then , and for once I was happy to have no public speaking skills . The Bierley construct jumped in with damage control whenever I was about to say something I should n't . He made jokes when Richardson dryly admitted that in all honesty , the construct was closer to a collaborative oil painting than it was to the real Jackson Bierley . Of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who seemed warmest , funniest , most human , was the one inside the video screen . <p> After the conference , we got calls from the Secretary of Commerce , the Speaker of the House , and both the Majority and Minority Leaders in the Senate . Even though they were falling all over themselves to offer support for funding , Richardson and I knew we could still screw it up , so we mostly listened in while the Bierley construct handled the calls . <p> It was Richardson who had pulled our fat out of the fire , but even I was caught up in the illusion . I felt grateful to Bierley . <p> * * * Once we 'd restored our funding , I expected things to return to normal . I thought Richardson would be eager to get back to work , but he would n't schedule meetings with me . Day after day , he hid out in his office to tie up what he said were " loose ends . " <p> I tried to be patient , but finally I 'd had enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said as I jerked open his office door . I stormed up to his desk . " You 've been stalling for two weeks . This project is supposed to be a collaboration ! " <p> Without looking up from his phone screen , he said , " Come in , " which was supposed to be funny . <p> " Richardson , " I told him , not caring who he might be talking to , " you were brilliant . You pulled off a coup . Great ! Now let 's get back to work . I can sit in my office and dream up augmentations for TOS all day , but it does n't mean squat if I 'm not getting your feedback . " <p> " Have a seat . " <p> " I 'd prefer to stand , damn it . We 're funded . We 're ready to go . Let 's get something done ! " <p> He looked up at last and said , " I 'm not a careerist , Maas . I 'm not motivated by impressing anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat down , tried to catch his eye . " I want to get to work for my own reasons , all right ? The Bierley construct is incredible . Now what can we do next ? " <p> " What indeed ? " <p> " Yes , " said the voice of Jackson Bierley . " I 'm going to be a pretty hard trick to top , especially once you 've got me in 3-D . " The phone screen was at an acute angle and hard for me to see , but now I noticed the silver hair . <p> " Is that it ? " I said . " You spend your day on the phone , chatting with the construct ? " <p> Richardson said , " Bye , Jackson , " and disconnected . " The construct is interesting . This is a useful tool we 've invented . " <p> " It is , " I agreed . " It 's something we can build on . " <p> " It 's something lots of people can build on . " He folded the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a call from a Hollywood agent . He wanted to talk to me about some ideas . Constructs for dead singers  --  they could not only do new recordings , but grant interviews . Dead actor constructs . TOS-generated films scripted by dead writers and directed by Hitchcock or Huston or Spielberg or any other dead director you 'd care to name . TOS is getting so good at imaging , you 'd never need to build a set or hire avid crew . " <p> " Is that what you 've spent all this time on ? " <p> " Of course not . It 's a good idea from the agent 's perspective  --  as he sees it , he 'd represent all of the virtual talent and practically own Hollywood . But it sounds to me like a waste of resources . " <p> " Good . " <p> " I 'm just pointing out that everybody who hears about what TOS can do will see it in terms of meeting his or her own needs . The agent sees dead stars . You see a stepping stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own inquiries . " <p> " What inquiries ? " <p> " We 've had that discussion . " He pointed at his wall . " They 've always had a better handle on it than we have . " <p> I looked where he was pointing , but just saw the usual time-lapse satellite image of weather systems crossing the globe . Then I realized that something was different . The display was n't of the western hemisphere , but of the eastern . <p> Richardson picked up the statue on his desk . " Shiva , " he said . " This arc of flames that surrounds him is life and death . Flames for life . Spaces between the flames for death . The one and the zero . Reincarnation . " <p> For once it was my turn to be the skeptic . " You find that consoling ? An afterlife that ca n't be verified ? It 's superstition , Richardson . " <p> " It 's religion , " he said , " and I do n't have any more faith than you do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't disbelieve it as much as you do . Since it ca n't be falsified , it 's not subject to any scientific test . But as a metaphor , I find it fascinating . " <p> " What are you talking about ? " <p> " Maas , what if you really knew death ? What if you and death were intimate ? " <p> " I still do n't follow you . " <p> " You 're so interested in synthetic consciousness . What about synthesized death ? If you knew more about death , Maas , would you still have this unreasoning fear of it ? " <p> I snapped , " What do you mean , ' unreasoning ' ? " <p> " Forget it . I guess it 's not your cup of tea . Why do n't you think about this instead : Could a TOS construct replace you ? " <p> " Replace me ? " <p> " The way we replaced Bierley . The Bierley construct works for us every bit as well as the original did . So what about you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work on augmenting TOS as well as you do ? It could sound like you , it could interact with other people convincingly , but could it think like you , design like you ? " <p> " I do n't know , " I said . doubt it . A construct mimics social impressions " I The pattern of thought that produces the behavior in the construct is n't sequenced quite like the thought in our heads . But you know that . Hell , what are you asking me for ? You 're the information expert . " <p> " Well , if the behavior is the same , if the behavior is the production of good ideas , then maybe all we 'd have to do is teach the machine to go through the motions that produce that behavior . We 'd get the construct to act out whatever it is that you do when you 're producing a good idea . Maybe it would kick out quality results as a sort of by-product . " <p> I chewed my lip . " I do n't think so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's social skills . Not the same . " <p> " You doubt the machine intelligence is sufficiently sophisticated , right ? " Richardson said . " You 're investing all this hope in TOS as a repository of consciousness , but you 're not sure that we can even begin to synthesize creative thinking . <p> " Bierley makes for some interesting speculation , " he went on . " Do n't you think so ? The original is dead . Jackson Bierley , in that sense , is complete . What we 're left with is our memories of him . That 's what we keep revising . And is n't that always true ? <p> " My father died fifteen years ago , " he said , " and I still feel as though my relationship with him changes from year to year . A life is like a novel that bums as you read it . You read the last page , and it 's complete . You think about it , then , reflect on the parts that puzzle you . You feel some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can remember only so many of the pages . That 's what the construct is good for  --  remembering pages . " <p> He smiled . " And here 's the metaphysics : While you 're trying to remember the book that 's gone , maybe the author is writing a new one . " <p> He put the statue of Shiva down on his desk . " Give me some more time , Maas . I 'm not sitting on my hands , I promise you that . I 'm working on my perspective . " <p> " Your perspective . " <p> " That 's what I said . " <p> I exhaled sharply . " I 've been thinking about your suggestion that we tie building security into TOS . I could do that . And I guess I could work on getting rid of the hurricanes once and for all . But that 's not just a hardware problem . " <p> " All right . I 'll give you an hour a day on that . Okay ? " <p> I did n't tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him off , who knew how long it would take for us to get back to our real work ? I said , " Get your perspective straight in a week . " <p> In a week , he was gone . <p> One of the research assistants , somewhat timidly , brought me the news . She had been watching CNN Four and saw a bombing story across town , and she was certain that she had seen Philip Richardson among the dead . <p> She followed me into my office , where I switched on the TV . CNN Four recycles its splatter stories every twenty minutes , so we did n't have long to wait . <p> The bomb had gone off in a subway station . Did Richardson ride the subway ? I realized I did n't know where the man lived or how he got back and forth from work . <p> The station would have channeled the energy up through its blast vents  --  everything in the city was designed or redesigned these days with bombs in mind . But that saved structures , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of twisted bodies . The color , as in all bomb-blast scenes , seemed wrong ; the concussion turns the victims ' skin slightly blue . <p> The camera panned across arms and legs , the faces turned toward the camera and away . <p> " Three terrorist groups , Under Deconstruction , Aftershock , and The Last Wave , have all claimed responsibility for the bombing , " said the news reader . <p> There , at the end of the pan , was Philip Richardson , discolored like the rest . At the end of the story , I ran back the television 's memory cache and replayed the images . I froze the one that showed Richardson . <p> " Get out , " I told the research assistant . " Please . " <p> I called the police . <p> " Are you family ? " asked the desk sergeant when I told her what I wanted . " We ca n't make a verification like that until the next of kin have been notified . " <p> " His goddam face was just on the goddam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . " Hang on . " Her gaze shifted from the phone to another monitor as she keyed in the query . " No problem , anyway . This is cleared to go out . And , yeah , sorry . The list of fatalities includes your friend . " <p> I broke the connection . <p> " He was no friend of mine . " <p> Deserter . <p> At first I dismissed the thought of making a Richardson personality construct . It was n't the personality I needed , but the mind . Substance , not surface . But how different were they , really ? <p> Maybe , Richardson had said , all we 'd have to do is teach the machine to go through the motions . Maybe it would kick out results as a by-product . <p> I went to the I/O room where the hologram generator  --  Richardson 's idea  --  had been installed . I called up Bierley . <p> " Hello , Maas , " he said . <p> " Hi , Jackson . " <p> " First names ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you . " Except for distortion flecks that were like a fine dust floating around him , Bierley was convincingly present . <p> " Well , " I said , " let 's be pals . " <p> His laugh was ironic and embracing at the same time . " All right , " he said . " Let 's . " <p> " Jackson , what 's the product of 52,689 and 31,476 ? " <p> " My net worth ? " <p> " No . Do n't kid . What 's the product ? " <p> " What were those numbers again ? " <p> " You 're shading me , Jackson . You ca n't have forgotten . " <p> About then , the Small Craft Advisory light came on , but I ignored it . Chaotic disturbances hardly ever built to hurricane force anymore . Sure enough , the light went out soon after it had come on . <p> " What 's this about ? " Bierley asked me . <p> " Did you calculate the product on the way to deciding how you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an analysis of what Bierley would say ? " <p> " I did neither , " Bierley said . Which was true . There was n't an " I " there , except as a grammatical convention . " Do n't confuse me with your machine , Dr. Maas . You 're the scientist . You know what I 'm talking about . " He brushed the lapel of his jacket . " I 'm an elegant illusion . " <p> " Would you give me some investment advice , Jackson ? " <p> The hologram smiled . " My forte was always building companies , " he said , " not trading stocks . Best advice that I could give you about stocks is some I got at my daddy 's knee . He said you do n't go marrying some gal just because another fool loves her . " <p> I smiled , and then I wondered if Bierley 's father had actually said that . If it sounded good , that 's what would matter to the construct . But that 's just what would have mattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what had mattered to the real Bierley and what mattered now to the construct was that the story have its effect . He had made me smile , made me think that Bierley the billionaire was just a regular guy . <p> What if a Richardson construct could work the same way ? The effect that Richardson had produced , the one I wanted to duplicate , was an effect on me . I wanted to stretch my thinking . What if that depended more on the emotional state he generated in me than on his actual ideas ? <p> No , I thought . That was ridiculous . <p> What decided me was the phone call . <p> " Are you Maas ? " the woman said . Her hair was long and black , but disarrayed . Her eyes were red-rimmed . On her face was the blankness that comes after too many days of anger or grief or worry , when the muscles ca n't hold the form of feeling any longer , but the feeling persists . " I 'm Phillips , " I thought she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her name was Phillips . But she was only pausing to search for the next word . <p> " I 'm Philip 's . . . widow , " she said . <p> I had n't known Richardson was married . I was n't the only one he had deserted . <p> " Yes , " I said , and then again , more gently : " Yes , Mrs. Richardson . I 'm Dr. Maas . " An infant wailed in the background , and Mrs. Richardson seemed not to have noticed . " I 'm Elliot Maas . " <p> " Do you know where he is ? " she asked . <p> Was she really asking what I thought she was ? I opened , then closed my mouth . What would I tell her ? He 's dead , Mrs. Richardson . Death is not a location . Where is he ? He is n't anywhere . Mrs. Richardson , he is not . Mrs. Richardson , your husband does n't exist . Where he used to be , there is nothing . Mrs. Richardson . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm not being very clear . " She put her hand to her forehead and closed her eyes . " The ashes , Dr. Maas . Have the ashes been delivered to you ? " <p> I stared stupidly at the screen . <p> " The coroner 's office says they had the ashes delivered to me , but they did n't . I thought perhaps they had made a mistake and sent them to Philip 's work address . " She opened her eyes . " Did the coroner 's office make a delivery ? " In the background , the infant cried more lustily . <p> " I do n't know , " I said . " I could check , I suppose . " <p> " They used to . . . " Her mouth trembled , and she pursed her lips . Her eyes glistened . " They used to let you make your own arrangements , " she said . " But they do n't do that anymore because there are so many bombs and so many . . . I never saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they ca n't even find his ashes . " <p> " I 'll make inquiries . " <p> " His mother 's been here , trying to help out , but she . . . " Richardson 's wife blinked , as if waking . " Oh , God . The baby . I 'm so sorry . " <p> The phone went black , then the screen showed the Ameritech logo and the dial tone began to drone . <p> I made sure that the ashes had n't been delivered to us , and I called the coroner 's office where they swore that the ashes had been processed and delivered to Richardson 's home address days earlier . They had a computer record of it . <p> When I called Mrs. Richardson back , it was the other Mrs. Richardson  --  his mother  --  who answered . She looked worn out , too . One more person that Richardson had abandoned . <p> But she would manage to get by in whatever way she had managed before . I was the one he had hurt the most . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Richardson 's wife came to the phone , I told her that I 'd struck out with the coroner . " But I think there is a way that I can help you , " I said . I even admitted that it might be of some use to me , as well . <p> Who knows whether the construct brought Sharon Richardson any consolation ? She came by from time to time as the construct evolved , and she usually brought the baby . That actually caused a problem the first time she did it  --  I had cleared her through the building 's recognition system , but TOS did n't want to let Richardson 's infant daughter , a stranger , inside without my authorization . The door refused to open . TOS-mediated security still needed some tinkering . <p> In the I/O room , Sharon Richardson told the construct , " We miss you . " <p> " He loved you , " the construct told her . <p> " We miss you , " she said again . <p> " I 'm not really him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you want me to say ? " <p> " I do n't know . There 's something that never got said , but I do n't know what it is . " <p> " Everything passes away . Nothing lasts , " the construct said . " That 's the thing he carried with him every moment . Nothing lasts , and that 's the thing we have to hold on to . That 's the thing we have to understand , that we 're as transitory as thoughts . Butterflies or thoughts . When we really understand that , then we 're beautiful . " <p> Defeatist , I thought . Deserter . <p> " That 's not it , " she said . " I heard him say that . More than once . " <p> " What do you want me to say ? " the construct repeated . <p> She looked at me , self-conscious , then turned away . <p> " He was selfish , " she said to the floor . " I want to hear him . . . I want you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do you think he died on purpose ? " <p> " Did he ? " she said . " I loved him ! " <p> " Nothing lasts . " <p> " Say it ! " <p> The image of Philip Richardson closed his eyes , hung his head , and said , " Death comes . Sooner or later , it comes . " <p> Sharon Richardson did n't leave looking any more prepared for life without Philip than she had looked when she first called me , looking for his ashes . <p> I was n't any more satisfied than she was . That the construct was n't finished yet was the one thing that gave me hope . But not much . <p> Using the Bierley construct as the interviewer , TOS had talked to Sharon , to Richardson 's mother , his brother , and his two sisters . The interviews took place in the I/O room where the hologram made Bierley more convincingly warm , caring , and real . He extracted insights , anecdotes , and honest appraisals from every technician who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's grad school peers and colleagues from his stints at MIT and Stanford . They all talked to Bierley , and Bierley interviewed me , too . I was as exhaustive and as honest as I could be in conveying my impressions of Richardson . Everything about him mattered  --  even whatever had irritated me . It was all part of the pattern that made him Philip Richardson . After the interviews , I 'd stay in the I/O room talking to the construct as it developed . That made for late nights . <p> Irritatingly , TOS started to suffer again from hurricanes . Those chaos storms in the information flow started to shut down the Richardson construct around one in the morning regularly . <p> " It 's like you 're too much contradiction for TOS to handle , " I told the construct late one night . " A scientist and a mystic . " <p> " No mystic , " Richardson said . " I 'm more scientist than you are , Maas . You 're in a contest with the universe . You want to beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , guaranteed to keep you alive forever with the proviso that you 'd never understand how it worked , you 'd jump at the chance . Science is a means to you . You want results . You 're a mere technologist . " <p> " I have a focus . You could never keep yourself on track . " <p> " You have an obsession , " the construct countered . " You 're right that I can never resist the temptation of the more interesting questions . But that 's what matters to me . What does all of this  --  " He swept his hand wide to encompass the universe with his gesture , and his hand came to rest on his own chest . " What does it all mean ? That 's my question , Maas . I never stop asking it . " <p> " You sound like him . Sometimes I forget what you are . " <p> " I 'm a dead loss , that 's what I am , " the construct said with a smile . " I probably argue as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm just TOS . Not that the machine is chopped liver , but you have n't resurrected Philip Richardson . " <p> The Small Craft Advisory light had been on for an hour , but now the next light in the sequence came on . Gale Warning . <p> " We 'd better talk fast , " said Richardson . " I do n't have much time . " He smiled again . " Memento mori . " <p> I said nothing , but stared at him . The hologram generator had been improved a bit recently , and for minutes at a time , I could detect no flaw in his appearance . The eye was so easy to fool . <p> This was the fifth night in a row with a hurricane . They always came after midnight . Tick , tick , tick . Like clockwork . <p> But TOS hurricanes were a function of chaos . Why would they suddenly behave so predictably ? <p> And then I thought again , The eye is so easy to fool . <p> The ashes never had turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said aloud . <p> That 's when the hurricane light came on and the hologram of Philip Richardson winked out . <p> I sat thinking for five minutes in the quiet building , the building that was down to just two overnight guards  --  a skeleton crew  --  since TOS oversaw security and controlled all the locks inside and out . A big , silent building . For five minutes , I considered what I needed to do . Then I went to the part of the building that housed the TOS memory . <p> The multi-cameral design of TOS made it relatively easy to isolate various functions from one another . I could pull all the sensory " rooms " off-line and make changes in them , and the rest of TOS would n't know what I was doing . It would be like slicing the corpus callosum in the human brain the left hemisphere would n't know what the right was doing , would n't know that things were being monkeyed with in the other hemisphere . But TOS was self-programming , so I needed instructions from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done without tripping whatever safeguards Richardson had programmed in meant pulling out one room at a time , giving it a function , downloading the result of the function as a digital record , then emptying the room of any traces of what it had just done before I connected it back to the whole . One room at a time , I captured the instructions that would let me generate false data for the sensory rooms . <p> The process would have taken thirty seconds if I could have just told TOS what I wanted to do , but it would n't have worked that way . Doing it the slow way took an hour . <p> I went back to the I/O room and said , " I 'm going home . " TOS started to process the words , and the phrase tugged at the tripwires I had just programmed . <p> To the rest of TOS , the sensory rooms sent sounds and images of my walking out of the room , closing the door , walking down the corridor , down the stairs , out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw me get into my car and drive away . <p> And TOS did n't just see this . It heard , felt , and smelled it , too . <p> Meanwhile , the sensory rooms suppressed the data that was coming from the I/O room , data that said I was still there , at the back of the room , hiding behind file cabinets with the lights out . Otherwise , everything ran as it normally would . <p> The eye was easy to fool . Yes , and so was the ear . So was the motion detector . So was the air sampler . <p> He came in at about four o'clock . The hall lights at his back showed that he was dressed in something baggy . He said , " Lights , " and the lights came on in the room . It was a sweat suit . A gray one . He said , " The one and the zero , " his code , I suppose , for " System Restore , " and the Hurricane , Gale Warning , and Small Craft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called up the construct and said to it , in a flat voice , " Hello , Richardson . " <p> And the construct answered , mimicking the tone , " Hello , Richardson . " The construct shook his head . " You sound hollow . " Then he smiled . " Death warmed over , eh ? " <p> The man in the sweat suit sat down with his back to me and watched the construct without answering . <p> " So tell me what it 's like , " said the construct . " You give me some information for a change . " <p> " It 's more real than you could believe . He 's more dead than you can imagine . " <p> " Of course . " Big smile . " I 'm a construct . I only seem to imagine . " <p> " Richardson is more dead than even Richardson could have imagined . " <p> " Was n't that the point of this exercise ? " <p> The man in the sweat suit did n't answer . <p> " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a breakthrough ! " <p> " I suppose it is . " He took a deep breath and let it out . " Give me Bierley . " <p> " Cheer up , " the construct said . " It 's the great adventure . You 'll make the journey with your memory intact . " <p> " Shut your trap and give me Bierley . " <p> The Richardson construct hesitated a moment longer . Then , without transition , it was Bierley in the hologram . <p> " Hi , " Bierley said . <p> " Hi , Jackson . " <p> " You do n't look so good . " <p> " So I 've been told . " <p> " Want to start with easy questions ? " asked Bierley . " His favorite color , that sort of thing ? " <p> " I 'm through with the construct . It does n't interest me anymore . " He stood up . " I just came by to tell you that it 's time for me to move on . " " That 's enough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my voice , but he did n't turn around . . . <p> " Richardson , " I told him , " you are a son of a bitch . " <p> " Richardson 's dead . " <p> " So you 've told me , " said Bierley . <p> " I was talking to Maas , " he said , his voice still flat . <p> " Maas went home over an hour ago , " said the construct . <p> " Turn the construct off , " I told him . " I built a sensory barricade . TOS does n't know I 'm in the building , and wo n't know it until I leave this room . " <p> " Clever . " <p> " What is ? " said Bierley . <p> I said , " No more clever than splicing yourself into the image bank at CNN Four . No more clever than hacking your way into records at the coroner 's office and police department . " <p> " TOS did most of the work . " <p> " Most of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it off , " I said again . <p> " Bierley , " he said , " give me Richardson again . " <p> The hologram flipped immediately to the other man 's image . <p> " You want Richardson ? There he is . That 's the closest anyone can get . Not the real thing , of course , but more Richardson than I am . " But then he did shut the construct down . Again he said , " Richardson is dead . " <p> " You used me . You planted the idea . You knew I 'd build the construct . " <p> " I 'm not him . I 'm the space in between . I 'm the void . " He edged toward the door as I stepped closer to him , close enough to see his profile . He still did n't turn to face me . <p> " I want to kick your living , breathing ass , " I said . " We 've lost a lot of time on this . " <p> I nodded at the empty space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've met him . You 've had a chance to see yourself as others saw you . Was it worth it ? " <p> He said nothing at first . " The curious thing , " he said at last , " was that the construct was n't surprised to meet me . " <p> " Nothing much fazes you , Richardson . Why should your construct be any different ? " <p> " I do n't think that 's it , " he said . " I think it was something others knew about Richardson , that he would do anything to know . . . " <p> " What do you do during the day ? Do you watch the building ? " <p> He was silent . <p> " Have you seen your wife come here ? Does n't look good , does she ? She paid a price for your little experiment , would n't you say ? Have you been keeping up ? " <p> " Every day , " he said , " I 'm aware of the zero where Richardson used to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his absence . " <p> I clenched my fists . " Do you have any idea what it 's been like for me to think that you were gone ? " <p> " I know she " For a moment , he was at a loss . " He loved her very much . " <p> " What about me ? I ca n't bring TOS to its potential on my own . You left me without hope ! " <p> " Richardson did that , " he said . And again , flatly : " Richardson is dead . " <p> " Why did you have to do it like this ? We could have made you a construct ! Do you think you need to be dead for people to say what they really think of you ? " I pounded my fist on the hologram console . " Damn it , I 'd have done whatever you wanted me to . Whatever it takes , whatever you need . But it did n't have to be like this ! " <p> " Richardson wanted to bring you along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the door . " He thought it would help you if you had a closer look at what you were afraid of . " <p> I sat down . I tried to take the anger out of my voice . " Whatever you need , " I said , " however strange , you just ask for it from now on . Understand ? After we get this straightened out , assuming I can keep you out of prison , you tell me about how you want to use TOS , and we 'll do that . Just so you give some attention to the things that I am interested in . " <p> " I do n't think you understand . You ca n't bring him back from the dead . The construct was for the bardo . " <p> " The what ? " <p> " The in-between time . Before its next life , the soul looks back , understands . Looks back , but there 's no going back . There 's only the next life , and forgetfulness . " <p> He turned his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in truth he did n't look like himself . <p> " I 'm the soul who does n't forget . I 'll have a new life , the life of a man who understands death . I have died . I am dead . And I will live again . " He looked at his hands . " What a thing to long for . " <p> He was right . I had n't understood . I had thought this whole thing was like the story of the man who stages his own funeral so he can hear what the mourners will have to say about him . But there was more to it than that . <p> I said , " You 're not going anywhere . " <p> He stepped closer to the door . " I 'll have another life . " <p> " Got TOS to make an electronic funds transfer , did you ? You 're a rich man ? " <p> " It 's not like that . I 'm going naked . I 'm taking nothing along . " <p> " I see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newfound wisdom . " <p> " Memory . " <p> " How about your wife , then ? Did you and TOS arrange some little windfall for her ? " <p> " Richardson 's wife ! " he shouted . " I 'm not him ! Richardson is dead ! " <p> He ran , then . I followed him out of the I/O room , but I did n't bother to run . <p> As soon as I was out in the hallway , TOS did what I knew it would do . I had just materialized out of thin air , and TOS could only conclude , recognizing me or not , that some sort of security breach had taken place . <p> All over the building , doors locked . The alarm rang at the security guards ' desks . Through the glass wall along the corridor , I could see one of the guards in the other wing looking up at the lights on our floor . <p> Richardson tried the stairwell door . It would n't budge . <p> " Richardson , " I said gently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran down the side corridor , but was blocked by a fire door . <p> " It 's over , " I said when I had turned the comer . " Let it be over . " <p> He whirled to face me . " I wo n't bring him back ! " he said . " Forever is your obsession , not mine ! " Then , pleading : " I ca n't bring him back ! It ca n't be done ! " <p> " Surely , " I said , " you 've seen whatever you needed to see . Surely you have come to understand whatever it is that you needed to understand . " <p> " I wo n't help you ! " <p> I grabbed the front of his sweat shirt . " When they arrest you , Philip , when the truth comes out . . . " <p> He masked his face with shaking hands and slumped against the fire door . <p> " When the truth comes out , I can help you or I can hurt you , Richardson . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He 's dead . " <p> " You can get your life back . It 's going to be a bit smashed up . It 's going to take some piecing back together . But you can have it back . " <p> He pressed his hands hard against his face . <p> Bierley saved his ass . <p> The construct was making calls to our politicos before the police had taken Richardson from the building , and before sunrise , there were thirty spin doctors in different parts of the country finding ways to put what Richardson had done in the best possible light . <p> The press verdict , basically , was genius stretched to the limit . He 'd pushed himself too hard doing work vital to national interests . The courts ordered rest , lots of psychological evaluations , and release under his own recognizance . Eventually , he received a suspended sentence for data fraud . <p> And Sharon Richardson took him back . I would n't have , if he 'd been replaceable . It was hard to imagine an infidelity worse than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she chose to . <p> Deserters . <p> When the work is hard , I think of deserters . And the work is often hard . We 've been at it again for months now , but Richardson and I do n't throw off sparks the way we once did . We talk about technical problems with TOS , and we bounce ideas off each other , but something 's gone . <p> No more conceptual leaps . No more flying from breakthrough to breakthrough . <p> I think of men on the rail of a sinking tanker . I think of the arctic explorer stranded on the ice . <p> I think of deserters . What are they afraid of ? <p> Maybe they are afraid of the wrong thing . <p> The dead bear witness . <p> From the bottom of the sea , dead sailors wave their arms . <p> It 's not that Richardson has gone dull . If anything , his mind has more edge than before . But we 'll be arguing some point of memory structures and I 'll happen to catch his eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking back . <p> " Philip Richardson , " he likes to remind me , " is dead . " <p> I 'd be a damned fool to believe him . <p> There are a lot of damned fools in the world . <p> I still hear the tick , tick , tick of my heart , the one , one , one that counts down to zero . I still believe that there 's a chance , just a chance , that I can find a door into eternity . When Richardson and I were at our best , there were days when I thought I had glimpsed that door . <p> But I do n't work with the same focus I once did . Whatever I 'm doing , there 's something that flutters at the edge of my consciousness . <p> When , at quiet moments , I hear the blood rush in my ears , when I feel my heart thumping in my chest , it 's not just the numbers counting down that I think of . It 's also the numbers already counted . Bierley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am fifty-nine years old . <p> What if I succeed ? What if I reside in TOS , eternal , separate , watching the living die and die and die ? <p> Often , I think of the man in the lifeboat . He has rowed himself to safety , beyond the burning oil , beyond the fire 's reach . Through the smoke and flames , he can see the others waving to him , holding out their arms . Do they think he 'd row back across the fire in a wooden boat ? <p> Crowded at the rail , the sailors wave and sink . Each drowns alone , but they sink together . <p> There 's no comfort in a common grave , I tell myself . <p> But on days when I ca n't think clearly , I sit and look at my hands , the hands of a man who is rowing himself to safety , and I know that the sea around him is wide . And black . And cold . And empty . <p> ILLUSTRATION : " Hold it .
