When it came time to deny the obvious , the cool and unflappable James Baker did so with a straight face and a practiced hint of sadness . Like a compassionate schoolteacher calmly instructing a roomful of dim students , the Secretary of State repeatedly insisted that election-year politics had nothing to do with last week 's announcement of the Administration 's plan to assist the former Soviet Union . " We 've been working on it for months , " Baker explained , adding that the President wanted his proposals made public before Boris Yeltsin faces a restless Congress of People 's Deputies this week . That much was true , but the rest was nonsense . <P> In fact , Pat Buchanan 's mindless " America first " crusade had paralyzed Bush for months . Foreign policy , the President 's passion and claim to fame , was stowed throughout the early primaries as Bush told Republican voters that his new first priority was repairing the domestic economy . Aiding Russia and the other republics became possible only when Buchanan 's challenge waned after Bush 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even then Bush was mute until Richard Nixon chastised the President for a " pathetically inadequate " nonresponse to Moscow 's pleas for help . And even then nothing happened until the White House realized that last Wednesday morning Bill $ Clinton was about to unveil his scheme to assist the faltering former communists . <P> When Bush finally spoke , confusion reigned . " The stakes , " the President soberly intoned , " are as high as any we have faced this century . " But there was no prime-time , Oval Office address designed to rally a recession-weary nation to the cause  --  only a pressroom briefing at which the Administration 's key players could n't say how much their proposal would cost . It was not until eight hours later that Baker said the U.S. contribution to a $24 billion multinational plan of loans , grants and export credits would cost American taxpayers a relatively small " $3-plus billion " in new funding . <P> Bush did manage to beat Clinton to the punch on Wednesday ( by all of 21 minutes ) but even that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aides as hollow . " Either we should have beaten Clinton by at least one news cycle or we should have waited a few days , " says a Bush political adviser . " As it was , all we did was pump up the opposition , " par for the course for a campaign organization that has yet to get its bearings . <P> The Bush and Clinton plans are strikingly similar , and both still see the planet as a dangerous place where the occasional use of American force will likely be necessary for decades to come . From there , their prescriptions for dealing with the post-cold war world depart radically . Bush regularly trumpets democracy 's virtues , but his actions routinely serve order and stability . Following the gulf war , the U.S. virtually " owned " Kuwait , but Washington did little to ensure democracy 's ascendancy in the emirate . Yugoslavia is disintegrating , but Bush has yet to recognize Slovenia and Croatia . The President clung to Mikhail Gorbachev to the end , and viewed Yeltsin as the problem rather than the solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clinton 's views are exactly opposite . Democracy , he says , offers the best hope for stability , even if moving toward representative government generates short-term disorder .
