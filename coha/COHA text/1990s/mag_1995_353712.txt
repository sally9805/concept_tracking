Beverly and David Cox never expected to make a permanent home for the baby girls they call by their initials , M.W. and T.W. ; they intended only to provide foster care until the sisters ' schizophrenic mother or another relative assumed responsibility . But that was five years ago , before the Coxes purchased a swing set , stocked their home in suburban Delafield , Wisconsin , with The Lion King , Pinocchio and Aladdin videos , and learned to distinguish M.W. 's tastes ( macaroni and cheese ) from T.W. 's ( jelly sandwiches , hold the peanut butter ) . It was also before the Milwaukee County Human Services Department asked the Coxes to adopt the girls , now 5 and 6 , and the couple readily agreed . But on June 14 , M.W. and T.W. were removed by court order to the home of an aunt . Since then the Coxes have been allowed to see the children only once , on July 28 , when they all dined together at a rib joint under the strict supervision of a caseworker . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says indignantly , " and now I ca n't even take them to the bathroom . " <P> The reason , the Coxes believe , is that the girls are black and the Coxes are white . " The issue is biology , not race , " says Jeff Aikin of Human Services , which changed its position after the aunt demanded custody of the girls . But as Beverly remembers it , the aunt , who wants to care for the children without terminating her sister 's parental rights , said , " I do n't want the kids raised or adopted in a white home . " The Coxes have appealed the removal order  --  and phoned Hillary Clinton 's office seeking support . Two weeks ago , the First Lady ended her new syndicated newspaper column with a plea for fewer restrictions on interracial adoptions , writing that " skin color should not outweigh the more important gift of love that adoptive parents want to offer . " <P> Of the roughly 440,000 children who currently languish in America 's foster-care system , 20,000 are available for adoption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 and 12 . Among the adoptable children , 44% are white and 43% are black . But 67% of all families waiting to adopt are white , and many of them are eager to take a black child . The hurdles , however , are often formidable . Though only three states  --  Arkansas , California and Minnesota  --  have laws promoting race matching in adoptions , 40 others favor the practice . <P> Many of these guidelines date from the early ' 70s , when the National Association of Black Social Workers condemned interracial adoption , eventually branding such placements " cultural genocide . " Last year the NABSW softened its stance to make transracial adoption a third option behind preservation of biological African-American families and placement of black children in black homes . But this racial bias has long been opposed by many adoption advocates , who have recently found unlikely allies among conservative Republicans averse to any form of racial preference and eager to move children off government support . <P> This unusual coalition is pressing for new federal guidelines to make the adoption process color-blind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penalty for states that delay or deny an adoption because of race , but the Senate has yet to debate the issue . Until the two chambers reach a compromise , the operative law is the Multiethnic Placement Act , which allows state agencies to consider race when making placements .
