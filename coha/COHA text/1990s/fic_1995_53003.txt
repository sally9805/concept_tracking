Once a year everyone else hated numbers as much as she did . She faced the pile of bank statements , receipts , 1099s , and W-2s with the comforting certainty that everyone else  --  all hundred million or so heads of household ( or their spouses )  --  felt exactly the same about the columns of numbers . Taxes again . Some people used computers , of course , and some had accountants . She had herself , four sharp pencils , and a pen to ink over the numbers if they ever balanced . <p> Brad would check them before she inked them . In an ordinary year , he would expect nothing of her but a steady supply of coffee and snacks , and the assembly of the documents , but this year he had orders  --  doctor 's orders - not to bother himself with tax preparation . He was sure she could do the taxes if she tried . He had recovered pretty well from the stroke , but he found it very hard to read . The words , he said , jumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , but with her it was numbers . Letters had graceful shapes , decorative qualities . Words carried with them their meaning smooth and rough , clear and opaque , each word on the page evoking a separate image in her mind . They never tangled themselves up , and best of all no one ever insisted on checking the sum , Numbers . . . she remembered her second-grade teacher slapping a ruler on the desk , and insisting that numbers were simpler than words , that any child who could read so well could surely add . " There 's only one right answer , " her teacher had said , and she had understood even then why words were better . You could imagine green as any shade of green you wanted . . . it did n't have to be right . <p> She remembered the trickle of sweat down her sides under her starched dress during flashcard drills , the horrible foreknowledge that she would blurt out the wrong answer and have to sit down , while another child " traveled " to the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scolded her for carelessness ; her mother had dragged her to the eye doctor for tests . Her eyes , he 'd said , were normal . It was probably an emotional thing , a physical symptom of her dislike of numbers . Most girls , he 'd said as he parted her head , did n't like arithmetic . Her mother and the teacher both interpreted this as laziness and deceitfulness , and she 'd spent miserable hours with the flash-cards until she passed into third grade . <p> Now she watched the numbers writhe , the blurred print of Brad 's W-2 shimmering so that she could hardly pick out the middle two digits of his Social Security number . Why did they insist on using numbers for identification ? She 'd have gladly changed her name to something outlandish to ensure uniqueness . And if they had to use them , why could n't she put her own number ? But they demanded his , and there was something even more humiliating about being identified by his number instead of her own . She did n't like it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> She printed Brad 's number in the little space , grimly careful , and began filling in the other blanks . Perhaps if she concentrated  --  her teachers had emphasized the dangers of daydreaming , of letting her imagination loose where numbers were concerned  --  she could get through this . She would treat it as a recipe , a long , complicated old-world recipe , or perhaps directions for reupholstering a couch . First you do this , then that , and at the end it looks like something you could eat , or sit on . <p> The problem was that she had no picture in her mind of what the completed , perfect tax form should look like . Cookbooks had pictures of those fancy dishes . Sewing books or home decorating books had pictures , pictures of drapes , dresses , furniture . The directions would make sense , because she would know what the end was . . . if you add sleeves to bodice , and bodice to skirt , you have a dress . If you add filling to meat , and meat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no pictures ; she could not see anything in them , no final outcome of all these blanks filled in except a form with its blanks filled in . . . it meant nothing . <p> She found she 'd miscopied the amount of interest income , and erased it carefully . That was wrong of course . Carelessness . It did mean something ; it meant if she made a mistake , they would come for her . They would take the money , and the house , and even put her in prison . The page before her shimmered , then went flat ; for a moment she could not find the right blank to fill in . Prison was all numbers , like the military . Brad had been in the military ; he still said , " By the numbers , " sometimes , a kind of joke from those days . She had written him two letters , to addresses full of numbers and letters in a jumbled mix that made no sense . Why , she had asked , could n't the army have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she poked the calculator 's flat-topped buttons . Wrong ; she forgot the decimal point . Another wrong ; her finger had slipped from the 8 to the 5 . She blinked at the bank 's form . Was that a computerized 0 , or an 8 ? Hard to read anytime , and now . . . her chest tightened . She took a deep breath , held it , let it out slowly . Eight , or zero ? Zero . Eight . The diagonal wavered , became horizontal , wavered back to diagonal , a tiny compass needle leading her the wrong way . She felt pressure in her head ; the numbers acquired a sinister aspect on the page , even beyond the threat of taxes , IRS , flash cards . She would have to quit for today ; she would have to come back to this later , another time , after a night 's rest . <p> She carried the wineglass carefully by the stem , so that she . would not smudge the clean delicate curves with her fingers . It seemed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was the first time she had been trusted to carry anything so breakable . She was setting a holiday table for Aunt Sarah , who was n't really her aunt , but her mother 's best friend in the neighborhood . <p> She leaned forward between the chairs , enjoying the sound of men 's voices speaking a language she did not know , to place the wineglass at the tip of the knife , just as Aunt Sarah had instructed . Strangers had come , friends of Uncle Sam 's and Aunt Sarah 's , from a time before they 'd moved to the brick house on the comer . The men ignored her , as they talked ; she expected that , though she did n't like it . Unlike the local men , they wore long sleeves , even in the heat . She wondered about that as she wondered about most things . Had they come from someplace even hotter ? One of them , sitting with his back in a blaze of sunlight , had finally unbuttoned his cuffs , and turned them back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> But the numbers . The numbers on the stranger 's arm , funny dark numbers that showed through wiry dark hair . She had never seen that . <p> She never remembered asking only that she had . Only that Aunt Sarah , for the first and only time , knuckled the back of her neck and dragged her into the next room , hissing fiercely in her ear : " Do n't ever ask ! Do n't EVER ask ! " And she remembered the man 's face turning toward her , white as his shirt , as white as the cuff turned back so carefully . . . and buttoned down as quickly , emotions she could not understand quickly hidden as the numbers , buttoned snugly under a common face of gentleness and good holiday manners . <p> She had a headache that night , the kind with blinding flashes of light in her eyes that would not go away , the kind she could not explain to grownups . The next day the grownups explained to her  --  gently , because she was young ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wineglasses , so carefully , so quietly ) about the numbers . They explained again later . They tried not to frighten her . You 're lucky , they said . You will never know such things . It 's all right . It 's over . He 's not angry with you . <p> But that one sidelong glance , and the feel of loving fingers fastened on the neck of her dress , suddenly harsh , suddenly strange : that could not be undone . She never saw the man again ; she was not surprised . He had been angry , she knew , whatever they said ; he had been hurt , and it was her fault for being lucky , for being rude , for all the things she had ever done wrong . The headache had been punishment . <p> The memory cycled endlessly . She remembered the texture of the cloth , the pattern of Aunt Sarah 's knives and forks , the feel of the wineglass stem between her fingers , the struggle she had had to walk carefully , not skipping from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the smell of the roast and vegetables , the way her foot had bumped the table leg . The dishes that day had pink roses around the rims , not linked blue squares ; Aunt Sarah was funny about that , and never used both sets on the table at once . <p> She remembered the faint clean smell of Uncle Sam 's shaving lotion , the men 's strong hands gesturing as they talked in that language she had never heard , a language full of blocky , angular sounds . It sounded old , she thought , older than anything she spoke , older than Spanish , or the Latin the priests spoke in her friend Mary 's church . She had liked the language , but she had not really liked the other men that much . They were ignoring her . Uncle Sam and Aunt Sarah never ignored her ; they had no daughter and she fit neatly between their sons in age . She enjoyed a special position in this house ; she often pretended she really was their niece , that she belonged to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave the men alone to talk , she wished they would all look at her , recognize her as part of the family , even approve of her , as Uncle Sam did . <p> It was in that context she had leaned forward , flicked a flirtatious glance at Uncle Sam , and asked what she had asked . About the numbers . <p> She woke sweating from that nightmare again . She never quite heard her own voice , never quite remembered which intolerable words she had used to ask that intolerable question . If she heard herself , she sometimes thought , she could not bear it . She pushed the covers aside , and sat up . Over forty , and still caught in that old disgrace  --  ! Ridiculous . Her friends told her that , and had told her that , and still once or twice a year she woke in a panic , like this , with the full weight of it still on her head . She knew , as they did not , that nothing could undo the pain she had given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sword into so wounded an adult , what hope for adults ? What hope for her , who had made so many stupid mistakes , not only that one , and not only from opening her mouth to ask stupid questions . . . though that was , even now , a constant failing . <p> Brad was asleep ; the cry she remembered giving must have been in the dream for he had not stirred . She pushed herself off the bed and blinked hard , trying to see in the darkness . Flickers of light , not quite enough to signal a migraine on its way , but a warning . She found her slippers by feel , and shuffled down the hall , running her hand along the wall . No sound from Lee 's room , and none from Tina . They both slept heavily ; she 'd been lucky that way , too . Glimmers danced in her sight , linking into shapes she did n't want to see . Migraine aura , she reminded herself firmly . It 's not really numbers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remember the numbers , not even when she could see the man 's arm , the cigarette in his fingers , and the line at the wrist where the brown hand became the white arm . She could see the fine dark hairs , the white skin below , and the numbers ... but not which . <p> She staggered into the kitchen doorframe , and clung to it . The glimmers twitched , pulsing : with her heartbeat , edging into almost coherent patterns . No longer strings of numbers . . . now they made headlines , glowing in nasty lime-green , of the most stupid or creel things she had ever said , and now dislimned into portraits of dead faces , green on black . Then they turned gold , brilliant glittering specks of gold that broke crisply into angled patterns , dazzling . Migraine aura . She knew it had to be that , and nothing more . . . even when the gold brightened intolerably , each speck spreading to a wide flake like one lens of an insect 's compound eye . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lens reflecting her child 's face , the two little bows she had worn holding the side-hair back , the lace collar . The child 's mouth opened  --  her mouth  --  and out sped geometric solids of glittering gold , flashing light from each facet , from a numeral etched on each face . Hundreds of mouths , hundreds of solids , hundreds of numbers , sickeningly in motion as the vast insect turned its head . From around the eye jointed antennae sprouted , proliferated , elaborated , into great feather fans that waved toward her . <p> She turned the light on . She had never seen the room before , this tiled kitchen floor with its glittering reflection , the ominous bulk of some purring alien at her side . She grabbed for safety , and its side came away in her hand ; cold air poured over her feet . Re-fri-ger-a-tor floated through her mind in a stuttering sequence , each sound edged with tattered frills of meaning . She leaned toward the light and cold , but it disappeared with a faint thud , exhaling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her vision , the faceted mosaic of gold and black lay between her and the strange room . Then it wavered and vanished , leaving behind only an edge of brightness around each object , a vague shimmer . <p> She still did not know the room . Or , she told herself , she knew it intellectually , but as an abstraction . She knew the canned peas would be behind that door ; she knew her dishes had a pattern of blue flowers on white . It did not interest her , and it held no memories of emotion . Her dishes could have been cream with pink roses , or yellow with a chain of blue squares . The table on which she had served so many meals might have been oblong instead of round . It might have had another cloth on it . The printed pattern of hers , a wreath of green vine leaves , seemed to mock her . <p> Take your medicine , one comer of her mind told her . Take it now . Medicine . The medicine was down the hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was locked , she would have to turn on the light to find the key . Brad would waken , and be muzzily sympathetic . In less than a breath , the right side of her face went stiff , she could feel the hardening of that side of her brain , as if someone had poured concrete into her empty skull . Too late now . . . a spike of pain impaled her head . Nausea rolled her stomach . So stupid , she told herself . You should have taken the medicine when you woke Up . She told herself that every time . <p> She could not have worked on taxes the next day even if the threat of another migraine had not pressed in on her , squeezing her mind to the lining of her skull . She had visitors . <p> " Do you come from a dysfunctional family ? " asked the new rector 's wife . They had come to introduce themselves , to I earn " about your needs and how the church can help you , " they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a good nurse who expects cooperation . <p> " No . . . not really , " She had backed into her chair as far as she could ; she flinched inwardly from the rector 's wife 's expression . They would already know , she supposed . They would already have made their judgments . " My  --  uh  --  parents were divorced , but aside from that  --  " That was not something most people could put aside , but she still felt that society 's reaction m divorce , especially in school , had done her more harm than the divorce itself . Now it was fashionable to have , come from a dysfunctional family ; back then only perfection would do . She distrusted the change in attitude . <p> " Aahh . " A knowing professional sound , judgment made and rendered all in one . Efficient . " Are you all right , really ? " <p> She was all right , really . She had learned to ignore the shimmering edges , the sudden disruption of vision into fragmented , faceted forms ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could tell herself firmly that her visual computer was malfunctioning ) , even the strangeness that made her own house , her own family , so disturbing . Migraine aura . That 's all it was , and the association with a childhood event purely accidental . No alcoholism , no drug addiction , no physical or sexual or emotional abuse . You 've got nothing to complain about , said the anonymous voice . You 're lucky . Luck being , as it were , her only handicap . <p> " Really all right , " she repeated , hoping it was only once . " Fine . " The rector 's wife had begun to glitter dangerously ; perhaps she would leave before she turned into an abstraction of planes and angles of beaten gold . The rector 's wife would be terrifying as an insect , vast and intrusive ; she would have grasping claws and the impersonal determination of a mantis dissecting a grasshopper for lunch . She must have said something else , because the rector was talking now , replying , it seemed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She blinked , hoping to resolve the pattern of bright dots and dark ones into something recognizable . The rector had dark hairs on the backs of his hands , and fingernails neatly dipped . <p> "  --  ought to tell him how you feel , " the rector said . " Or that 's a kind of lying , too , is n't it ? Concealing things ? One should be honest . . . " <p> As a child , perhaps , A child craving attention . A child honestly curious . A child putting together those two childish things . . . instead of putting away childish things . . . and thereby releasing . . . whatever she had released . She knew better than to say that ; she had said too much already . She walked them from the houses they smiled and waved . They had left their packet of wisdom for her . Honesty , forgiveness , love , wrapped in shining paper with shining ribbons around it . Her mind plucked at the glittering bows . <p> But it was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around , feeling unseen eyes . They had been blue , she remembered . Clear blue , and the whites very white , only a slight rim of red at the edge of the eyelid , probably from the smoke . Below his eyes a gray stain of sadness , the flesh sagging away from the bones . He had had one crooked front tooth , and some steel caps when he spoke that reflected points of light . It 's not me that wo n't forgive , she said silently to the car that had long since driven away . <p> Around her , the gray blocks piled up , neatly , inexorably . The time she had said something about Emily 's nose , the time she had snapped at Laura , the time she had lied about the check being in the mail . Days of plenty and peace , days of happiness , days when she had not thought of him at all , each one a gray stone walling her in . Stupid questions , cruel remarks , each a spike fixed in the stones , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complaints of her teachers . Pride , insensitivity , selfishness : the complaints of her spiritual leaders . Hypersensitivity , priggishness : the complaints of her friends . <p> She looked at her arms , unsurprised to find them covered with blue numbers , zero to infinity , all she had done wrong and failed to do right . Her head shuddered and split into wedges , like a chopped tomato . Each wedge , impaled on a spike , had its own faceted eyes with which to see , and what remained of her voice rose from the soggy puddle of juice at the joining of the wedges . Sorry , it said , in a child 's tremulous whisper . I 'm sorry . Being sorry is not enough , said the voice she would never quite forget , in the language she had never heard before . She knew the meaning though . She always did . <p> Her usual reluctance to confront numbers suggested the mail as an escape . A pile of bills , advertisements , and two magazines . She picked up the magazine and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the picture when her vision blurred ; with no warning aura , the migraine invaded , overfilling her skull , pressing cruel thumbs on her eyeballs . She squinted at the magazine anyway . A black and white photograph danced on the page like a clipping on the wind . <p> Blurred face , sad eyes , lines of age and pain . She could not read the obituary , not really . . . she had never known his name ; she had never remembered his profession . This was not the same man , could not be . One word only resolved into letters , quivering . She had seen that name in school , under the pictures of dead men stacked like firewood , a few survivors ' masklike faces . Those faces shifted , merged into faces from later pictures , later wars , flickered through her mind in an endless stream : men , women , children , babies , bodies , mouths gaping , eyes wide or closed in death , crowds behind barbed wire , single prisoners bunched in cells , eyes glistening in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lens and flickering shutter , with that expression she had never forgotten , that disbelief , that horror , that disgust . <p> The migraine squeezed itself , contracting to a single point of pain in midbrain . She grunted , as if someone had slugged her belly . Nothing was enough , nothing would ever be enough . She thought , as always too late , what she could have said to the rector 's smiling wife : " No , not a dysfunctional family . A dysfunctional world . " <p> With the suddenness of a pricked soap bubble , the migraine disappeared , leaving her unbalanced , almost giddy . <p> She laid the magazine on her desk , atop the piles of bank statements , the half-finished tax return . She felt warm and moist , a loaf of bread new-baked , steaming slightly . While her head was clear , while she could think , she would try to finish the taxes . Such respites , rare proof of the reality of miracles , lasted at most a few hours . <p> The numbers lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarkable than a collection of letters . She fed them into the calculator , copied them , added and subtracted as the directions specified . The result had a certainty she had never associated with numbers , a feeling of solidity so new that it surprised her into noticing . <p> Tentatively , she let her mind visualize a number : just a number , not a dark mark on white skin . A cascade of them , in the bright pastels of her childhood 's books , tumbled over each other , eager as puppies . Little yellow fives , soft lavender fours , orange threes , blue twos , fat white marshmallow ones , no longer scintillating in dangerous light , but docile , friendly , even affectionate . She felt as if she had stumbled into a strange universe where all the familiar rules changed . <p> In one blinding flash more intrusive than even the migraine , she saw the book itself , its pages smudged and worn at the edges , its pictures simple and innocent and harmless . Her own hand , none too clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) spread starfish-wise , her own voice piping " I like one and I like two and . . . that makes three , Mommy ! " <p> So she had not always hated numbers ; she had not always been driven to blind panic by the operation of one upon another . Had that panic come from her question , which even now loomed worse than the pain of migraines ? She shivered , hoping as always that she would not remember it . But the numbers themselves surrounded her , touched her hands , stroked her head ; softly , gently , insistently , they urged her through that final door where the terrible question lay , coiled malice , proof of iniquity beyond forgiveness , steeped in a poison only she could brew . No aura splintered that sight into painless abstraction , no migraine split her consciousness away from it  --  the numbers , merciless once more , compelled her . <p> Cowering in the comer of her mind , that memory trembled , fragile as a wineglass , as a child 's trust , as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers on his arm because he liked numbers , just as she liked numbers . Why else would someone put numbers on his arm , instead of the dragon or heart or snake tattoos she had seen on other men ? She wanted numbers too , perhaps in pretty colors like the dragons . She waited for a pause in the conversation , because she knew that interrupting was rude , and she asked her question as politely as she knew how . " When will I get my numbers ? " <p> ILLUSTRATION : YOU ARE IN YOUR POWER ! <p> <p> By Elizabeth Moon <p> Elizabeth Moon has published several novels , the most recent being Supporting Chance from Baen Books . She grew up in South Texas , earned degrees from Rice University and the University of Texas , spent three years in the Marines , six years in rural EMS , and four years on the city council of the very small town where she lives with her husband and son .
