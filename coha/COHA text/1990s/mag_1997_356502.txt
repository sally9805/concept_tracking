Out here on the windswept prairie of Minnesota , where we have only three seasons  --  either winter is just over or winter is on the way , or else it 's winter  --  and where by March we feel dull and flat and lost in the boondocks , it is pretty luxurious that the U. of M. basketball team won the 1997 Big Ten championship and went to the NCAA tournament . It 's the best news all winter . <P> Our team has a 27-3 record , but it 's no powerhouse : it 's one of those scrappy defensive teams that win big games by one or two points and give you three heart attacks in the last four minutes . The right team for a state of Germans and Scandinavians who believe in hard work , perseverance , and do n't think you 're somebody special , because you 're not . <P> We Midwesterners have a sixth sense , and it 's the sense of inferiority , a feeling that if we were really any good , we would n't be living here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as a recent article in a local magazine saying that Minneapolis is as hip as New York City . The magazine is the sort that goes in for cover stories like " Twenty-Five Best Sunday Brunches " or " Thirty-Six Ways to Turn Your Bathroom into a Place You Would Want to Spend the Entire Afternoon In "  --  and the article was terminally dopey , as any article about hipness would be . You do n't hear New Yorkers talk about how hip their city is ; they talk about harrowing cab rides , rapacious plumbers , crackheads on the sidewalk , all the usual urban horrors . New Yorkers know it 's not cool to talk about being hip . Some Midwesterners do n't understand that . <P> Inferiority is a big public issue here at the moment : the Minnesota legislature is debating whether to build a stadium for the Minnesota Twins , who might skip town if they do n't get one , and where would that leave us ? Back in the minor leagues , that 's where . No different from Des Moines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , recently told the people of Minnesota , who do not , that without major league sports the Twin Cities would be like Des Moines , " absolutely dead , " which caused some consternation in Iowa and not much in Minnesota , where the fear of being like Des Moines , or necrophobia , is not so potent , except in Minneapolis , of course . <P> Des Moinesity ( or Omahaness ) is a bigger issue in Minneapolis than in St. Paul . In St. Paul  --  a city with not so many Sunday brunches , whose residents look on bathrooms as places you go in and do your business and come out  --  we have our own ballpark , next to the railroad tracks south of the State Fair Grounds , where our baseball team , the Saints , plays against teams from Duluth , Sioux Falls , Sioux City , Fargo-Moorhead , Madison , Winnipeg and Thunder Bay . We wave at the trains as they go by , and we always have a good time regardless of what happens on the field . Between innings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pig with a bag of fresh baseballs on its back . Once , a player from an opposing team was offended by the pig and turned to the umpire and said , " That is so bush league , " and the ump said , " This is the bush leagues . "
