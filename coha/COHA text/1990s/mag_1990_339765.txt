All afternoon George Bush acted the gracious host to 50 old friends and family members at a White House Christmas party , singing carols and taking groups of children on the ultimate guided tour ( only the presidential bedroom was off limits ) . As the guests were leaving , a group of men slipped from behind the security screens on the ground floor and headed for the elevator to the family living quarters . But their timing was slightly off . They ran into the last departing guest , a woman who recognized them : Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Colin Powell , Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney , National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater . " Oh , oh , " the woman remarked . " Business as usual . " <P> Not quite . The group was on its way to plan the biggest U.S. military operation since Viet Nam : the invasion of Panama , launched two nights later . But perhaps she was not totally mistaken . If war preparations are scarcely usual in the Bush White House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would have seemed only a few months ago . The Panama invasion marks the latest , but far from the first , stage in a monumental transformation of George Bush : from a President whose overriding imperative during his initial months in office was to avoid doing " something dumb , " to a self-confident chief mapping a bold and individual  --  if not always prudent  --  foreign policy that he is quite willing to back with military force . <P> Nor does Bush hesitate these days to take long risks . The Panama invasion was supposed to accomplish three goals : 1 ) swiftly rout resistance ; 2 ) capture the country 's dictator , Manuel Antonio Noriega , and bring him to trial in the U.S. on drug-running charges ; 3 ) install a stable , democratic government headed by politicians who had apparently won May elections , which Noriega later overruled . <P> But if the invasion turned out to be less than fully successful , the Administration would be running grave dangers . At the extreme , it could bog down in a Viet Nam-style guerrilla @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Panamanian government that the U.S. installed may be regarded as American puppets ; President Guillermo Endara was sworn in by a Panamanian judge , but on an American military base at about the time the attack started . A drawn-out crisis could sour U.S. relations with other Latin American nations , eternally nervous about Yanqui intervention against however noxious a government . <P> It was impossible to tell whether the invasion would end up more like Viet Nam or more like Grenada . Some 24,000 U.S. troops had quickly taken command of most of Panama and overwhelmed organized resistance by the Panama Defense Forces , Noriega 's combination army and police . But Noriega got away and was thought to be hiding in the forests or even in the sprawling capital city ; the U.S. offered a $1 million reward for information leading to his capture .
