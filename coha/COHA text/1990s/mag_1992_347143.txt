" I am here to strengthen the bridge between those who were forced to flee and those who have carried on the struggle from within , " said dissident student leader Shen Tong in a statement prepared for a press conference in Beijing . But the flamboyant pro-democracy activist , one of the first to flee to the U.S. after the 1989 crackdown , never made it to the briefing . In a predawn swoop on his mother 's home , police hauled off Shen and two Chinese supporters for questioning . Two French journalists he had hired to shoot a video of his odyssey were deported to Hong Kong . A day later , Boston-based Sinologist Ross Terrill , author of several books on China and Shen 's adviser , was detained and subsequently expelled from the country , accused of " actions incompatible with his status as a tourist . " <P> During his three years of exile in Boston , Shen , 24 , organized groups opposed to the Beijing government . At the end of July , he returned legally to the mainland , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and government critics . Even though some of the groups argued that they should now support Deng Xiaoping , who is trying to dismantle the Stalinist economy , Shen insisted on setting up a Beijing branch of the U.S.-based Democracy for China Fund , a dissident organization that he heads . <P> Shen 's daring move may have been calculated to test the sincerity of Beijing 's latest public relations campaign . To help modernize the country , Chinese authorities have been wooing students home from overseas . Shen 's arrest could discourage the students from returning , and it might also galvanize support in the U.S. Congress for a bill that would allow them green- card status .
