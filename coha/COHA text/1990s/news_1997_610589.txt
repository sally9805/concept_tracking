<p> Menswear for spring ' 98 has evolved into an array of styles that at their core focus on comfort : the joy of kicking around in sandals , not wearing a tie , a belt or a watch , slouching , shuffling , never changing out of your pajamas . <p> The silhouettes may be trim , bordering on aerodynamic . The cuts may be based on business practicality . The fabrics and patterns may be the result of the latest technological breakthroughs . But all of that would be pointless , designers have decided , unless men feel comfortable in the clothes . <p> Jhane Barnes is fashion 's equivalent to a policy wonk . She excels at talking about the details of garments : textile production and development , new printing technologies , computer-assisted design . Most folks are content just to point out the pretty shirt on the model ; Barnes like to explain how it was created . <p> Throughout her career , she always has been fascinated by computers , mathematics , textile technology . As a high school student , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an astrophysicist . <p> Instead of presenting her spring collection in a runway format , she hosted a luncheon this afternoon . Models wandered between the tables , and she was able to stand in front of her audience and detail the new technology involved in her designs . <p> She has begun using Tencel fibers in her Platinum collection  --  a more experimental , luxurious part of her line . It 's where " we do new things that we 're not really sure are going to turn out and where price might be prohibitive , " she said . <p> She has been working with Tencel , a fiber similar to rayon , because its production is less of an assault on the environment than the method used to make the older , more common fiber . Tencel also is stronger and drapes similarly to silk . She cuts her trousers generously and creates short-sleeve sport shirts with squared-off bottoms designed to be worn untucked . Both silhouettes take advantage of Tencel 's fluidity . <p> But it is her photo-realistic prints that are the most captivating in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from computer disk directly onto fabric using something akin to a laser printer . The advantage of this is access to a rainbow of colors , no time-consuming and messy silk-screening and vibrant and subtle hues that look almost as if they have been hand-painted . <p> Designer Nicole Farhi takes men 's lounge wear  --  boxer shorts , pajamas  --  and puts them on the street . If innerwear as outerwear worked for women , perhaps it will succeed with men . <p> Noted for her delicate use of color , Farhi paired marigold silk shorts with a fragile crew neck in maize at her collection this afternoon . The edges of a fine , pale blue crew neck were edged in a shade of paprika . Trousers had drawstring waists . Sheer knit polos were layered over silky patterned shirts mimicking the ways women 's wear has experimented with layering as a form of color enhancement . <p> There were bold gingham jackets that , unfortunately , conjured up images of picnic tables . A few white suits reminded one of the Good Humor man . And while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who wants to spend a lot of money to look as if he just rolled out of bed . <p> But when Farhi keeps her silhouettes easy and her colors gentle , she provides men with a sophisticated , casual style that steers well clear of sloppy . <p> In the Boss Hugo Boss collection presented on Tuesday morning , the German powerhouse put its flagship line , the one filled with dress-for-success suits and executive sportswear , on the runway . There was nothing tricky here . The collection featured sleek , single-breasted suits in two- and three-button styles . They were either double-vented or ventless . The trousers were slim-fitting but not constricting . There were no cuffs to interrupt the smooth line , and the hem was top-stitched for a hand-worked appearance . Color combinations like dove gray and cream looked particularly fresh , and there were luscious jackets in Ultrasuede and smart overcoats in shimmering bronze . <p> Long gone is the excess fabric that once so defined fashion 's power suit . But the tight-fitting outfits of seasons past also have vanished . Designers have lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They also have stepped back from the hourglass suit , in which they attempted to accentuate a man 's waist , thereby emphasizing his shoulders . While it was an interesting exercise in body contouring , it simply was out of sync with times that call for comfort , ease of movement and a recognition that waistlines are expanding and shoulders are getting rounder , not broader . <p> Boss Hugo Boss creative director Lothar Reiff takes inspiration from the film " The English Patient , " borrowing from its classic , fluid silhouettes and desert palette . Knits were lightweight , almost sheer . The jacket waist was a bit higher and there was less construction , but nothing so relaxed as the sweater jacket that continues to perplex male consumers . <p> Hugo Boss is a company that understands the way men like their clothing to change : slowly and calmly . No wonder , then , that the company reports that its Georgetown location has been a success . But with the ever-growing product line , including a golf collection introduced this week at a luncheon , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are underway about the possibility of opening a second boutique at Tysons II Galleria . <p> Designer Donna Karan was n't talking about business . Instead , she was focused on the aesthetics of her DKNY collection , expounding on her philosophy of comfort and gender fluidity . But given the concerns of her stockholders about unbridled expenditures and extravagances like exotic idea-hunting trips , you could n't help but note the fiscal restraint demonstrated during this menswear week . Most noticeable : no full runway shows . Not for the secondary line presented on mannequins and a handful of live models Tuesday afternoon . And not for her signature collection , which will be shown in the same manner Thursday . <p> DKNY is filled with lightweight , open-weave sweaters , hand-painted knits , full drawstring karate trousers , slouchy sweater jackets . The guiding force , Karan said , is comfort . But there also is a sharing of ideas from her women 's wear line . <p> " I think there 's a oneness between a woman and a man , " Karan said . Women 's wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempting to bring that same dichotomy to menswear while maintaining " the design integrity . " She calls it bringing out a man 's " inner sensuality . " <p> Indeed , her collection is particularly languid , clothes meant for moving slowly and casually . And while she emphasizes that there are tailored pieces , such as trim gray suits with a hint of iridescence , DKNY for spring ' 98 is mostly focused on a man who does n't need a traditional suit every day . <p> DKNY is an enticing collection , but one ca n't help but wonder if Karan 's image of a sensual male is based on how women see men and not on how men see themselves . <p> The design team known as Richard Edwards emphasizes a different kind of ease  --  sexual comfort . The label nurtures the homoerotic aesthetic that has at various times been reflected in nerd chic and beefcake style . <p> The Richard Edwards runway Tuesday night was filled with snug trousers emphasizing well-muscled legs . Those pants are paired with short-sleeve shirts buttoned to the neck and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a strain of rock star casualness to the spring collection . The label offers a new version of the suit : Instead of blazer and pants , there are trousers with matching Eisenhower jackets or car coats with a satin finish . <p> Young designer Sandy Dalal held his first menswear presentation Tuesday afternoon . It was an auspicious beginning . <p> " Is this your first time ? " came the voice over the speaker at his show . It was the voice of " The Graduate 's " infamous Mrs. Robinson as she toyed with a befuddled and naive Benjamin Braddock . The recording alluded to Dalal as a fashion show virgin who turned out to have far more sophistication and confidence than anyone might have imagined . <p> Dalal , with his parents and grandmother looking on , presented a collection that blended the graphic plaids of parochial school uniforms with the luxurious silks and jacquards of traditional Indian attire . <p> First down his runway were bold , eye-popping plaids in tan and chocolate brown , merged with sheer , short-sleeve paisley shirts . Those led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirts and even a gray silk shantung frock coat . <p> Most impressive is Dalal 's confidence in mixing such disparate fabrics and styles and the quality of the sample garments that he is able to produce at his self-financed company . His inspiration , he said , comes from the seamstresses and textile producers he was exposed to as a young child . ( His mother worked in the fabric industry . ) But beyond that , there are no literary , film or philosophical influences . " I 'm only 21 , " he said . " I have n't had a life . " <p> But one would never have guessed his age , thanks to his mature design hand . The only sign that a young fellow might be responsible for the sharp collection was the footwear . Adidas sneakers or athletic sandals were worn with just about everything , including the suits . Yes , sneakers with business suits . We will allow that the combination looked cool here : under the spotlight , on twentysomething models with a hipster attitude , as a exaggeration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this on K Street .
