Over the years , when I would ask my friends about Mexico , I found that their travels centered on immaculate beaches and glorious sunsets . As I recall my first visit last fall , my fondest memories were those of magnificent museums , breathtaking views and stunning Mayan ruins . I bean my solo journey in Mexico City , the country 's mountainous capital . Mexico City has a timeless quality : Architecturally it is a hodgepodge of styles , from huts on the town 's outskirts to the postmodern brick behemoths that dominate the downtown area . The populace contributes to the time-warp ambience with fashions ranging from traditional guayabera dress shirts to flavorful hip-hop styles . Mexico City is the largest city in the Western Hemisphere . And judging by the major traffic jam I was stuck in on Reforma Boulevard , one of the city 's main thruways , after leaving the airport , it is also one of its most congested . Traffic in Mexico City looks like a sea of Volkswagen Beetles . In Mexico these cars are called belly buttons because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissipated when I arrived at the Palace of Fine Arts . Part museum , part theater , the architecture is a combination of Art Deco and Art Nouveau styles . Constructed of marble , the main theater is sumptuously furnished with red-plush seating and illuminated by a domed roof ; its curtain is a series of opal prisms of Tiffany glass . I was pleased to see a poster on the wall announcing the great operatic diva Grace Bumbry 's upcoming concert . The museum at the Palace of Fine Arts displays examples of Mexico 's cultural richness , including works by such famed artists as Frida Kahlo , Diego Rivera , Jose Clemente Orozco , David Alfaro Siqueiros and Rufino Tamayo . My favorite piece was Rivera 's Man at the Crossing of the Ways . Originally commissioned for New York City 's Rockefeller Center , the mural depicts Africans and Latinos suffering while a dead ringer for John D. Rockefeller placidly sips champagne . Needless to say , the work was rejected . I was mesmerized by Rivera 's work and by his portrayal of our people 's struggles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was some 50 years ago . Other museums I also enjoyed were the Pinacoteca Virreynal de San Diego , a former church more than 370 years old in which religious paintings are exhibited in a most serene environment , and the acclaimed 100,000-square-foot National Museum of Anthropology which traverses the pre-Hispanic cultures of Mesoamerica to its modern ethnology . Later I dined at the fine Arrecife Restaurant at Mexico City 's Stouffer Presidente . The seafood was as delectable as the view from my room , a series of city lights on a backdrop of stars . Surrounded by moonlit hills , Mexico City rivals the finest cities of the world for romanticism . If your conception of romance leans more toward a shimmering sea and beach , you should definitely consider the towns of Ixtapa and Zihuatanejo , an hour by plane from Mexico City . They are a couple 's paradise . Judging by the cuddling on the beach , it 's a place for true intimacy . The area has the feel of a diamond in the rough . After all , a mere two decades ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construction of many nightclubs and hotels , Ixtapa 's pace is much slower than , say , Acapulco 's . But that 's part of the appeal . For me , Ixtapa 's nearby island offered the best chance for athletic recreation . Accessible only by boat and framed by lush vegetation , the isle is a veritable wonderland . The beach is immaculate , and with average daily temperatures of 80degF , crowded . The clear blue water is wonderfully inviting , with swimming , waterskiing , yachting and parasailing among the favored activities . About four miles from Ixtapa is the former fishing village of Zihuatanejo . More than 500 years old , the town , once a Spanish port , offers the same joys as Ixtapa , including deep-sea diving and , of course , fishing . The cuisine of choice , not surprisingly , is seafood , and it is fresh and fierce . I tried seafood tacos  --  a prime sampler  --  at La Sirena Gorda ( " the fat siren " ) . The portions were as generous as the flavor was spicy . Bracketed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bungalows  --  none taller than the town 's palm trees  --  Zihuatanejo is that rarity of tourism : an intimate public resort . If peace and tranquility are n't your thing , Cancun , developed primarily for tourists , may be . A small island off the Yucatan Peninsula in the Mexican Caribbean turned hotel zone , Cancun is the quintessential tourist trap with nonstop traffic , brightly hued buildings and numerous shopping malls . In Cancun there appears to be a disco every 100 yards . At night , long lines snake through streets that pulsate with flashing lights and booming sound systems . Emblematic of the city 's mall mentality , there 's even a Hard Rock Cafe . Across the road from the Hard Rock is Continental Villas Plaza Cancun , where many African-American performers and jazz lovers stay during the annual jazz festival . At daybreak , while the revelers slept , I enjoyed the pristine white-sand beaches . Cancun is a narrow strip of an island connected to the mainland by two causeways . The outer-island side faces the Caribbean Sea ; the inner encloses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few resident alligator , a dip in the Caribbean seemed prudent . After an hour or two of swimming , I headed out of the city to see the Mayan ruins of Chichen Itza , 112 miles east of Cancun . The ruins are the remnants of a Mayan city from about 800 A.D. The three-hour drive from Cancun was as informative as the ruins themselves . Through the forest , the sight of Mexican villages  --  rows of unwieldy shacks with thatched roofs , patchwork-quilt cars on threadbare tires and barefoot children playing on hot dirt roads  --  stands in stark contrast to hyperactive Cancun . Chichen Itza has a majesty of its own . Dozens of temples extend for miles , erected with such precision that even the ravages of time can not dim their structural brilliance . Rectangular , chiseled gray stone temples resemble concrete layered wedding cakes and exude an aura of imposing mysticism . I was awed by the disparity between the prefabricated resort I had left only hours before and these inspirational shrines . After a long , perilous climb up steep , narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weight and irony of history : the genius of the design and the physical agony many endured to make it possible . As I gazed out over those incredible ruins and into the distance , I felt my spirit being cleansed . COZUMEL : LAND OF THE SWALLOW In Cozumel , Mayan for " Land of the Swallow , " I found a tranquil retreat on an island surrounded by jade-green waters and edged with white-sand beaches about 12 miles east of the Yucatan mainland and 30 miles southeast of Cancun . Cozumel 's rich flora ( do n't miss Chankanab National Park ) , fauna and marine life draw naturalists from all over the world . And in the jungle of Cozumel 's interior there are fascinating and little-known Mayan ruins , evidence of the island 's rich history . Guides and excursions are available in San Miguel , Cozumel 's only city and the hub of its activities . Once a quiet fishing village , San Miguel is now a sophisticated port of call for cruise ships , though it manages to keep a relaxed , friendly atmosphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Cozumel . The town , on the west side of the island , where the sea is calm , offers a wide range of accommodations and excellent dining and shopping , including arts , crafts and beautiful handmade silver jewelry from all over Mexico . The island 's undeveloped east coast , with its wild and spectacular surf , offers isolated beaches to explore . From the terrace of my room at the Stouffer Presidente Cozumel I watched pelicans , herons and egrets along the shore ( Cozumel is a bird-watcher 's paradise ) . The hotel has a beautiful beach , swimming pools , tennis courts and a cheerful and accommodating staff . Rental equipment for a wide variety of water sports is available .
