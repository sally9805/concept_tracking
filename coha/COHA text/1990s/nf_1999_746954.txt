IDENTIFYING THE NEEDS OF RECYCLING COORDINATORS <p> As part of its " Recycling Works " project , 25 local government recycling coordinators were interviewed recently by the National Recycling Coalition ( NRC ) during four focus groups in Charlotte , Philadelphia , St. Paul and Portland . Feedback indicated that the coordinators ' top needs are : Assistance in integrating the economics of recycling into a comprehensive waste and resource management system , e.g. , setting service fees , providing economic incentives for recycling and waste reduction , internalizing solid waste management costs and promoting full-cost accounting ; More partnerships between manufacturers and recyclers to expand markets for recycled materials and further institutionalize the use of recycled content and buy recycled programs ; Comprehensive and better-funded educational programs not only to reach the general public , but also elected officials and opinion leaders ; and More state and federal policies to encourage the use of recycled materials and products , and provide funding sources for recycling and pubic education programs . <p> A full summary of the focus group results and suggestions on a range of topics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NRC .

EPA ISSUES 1998 WASTE CHARACTERIZATION DATA <p> The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency just released its " Characterization of Municipal Solid Waste In The United States : 1998 Update , " which contains data for 1997 . Printed annually , the report discusses trends and highlights changes that have occurred over the years ( 1960 to 1997 ) , and includes projections of MSW generation to the year 2005 . According to the update , 217 million tons of MSW were generated in 1997 , up from 206 million tons from 1996 . Paper and paperboard products made up the largest percentage of all the materials in MSW , increasing by 4.2 million tons to 83.8 million tons , or 38.6 percent of total generation in 1997 . The update says the increase was due to a rebound in newsprint production , and more production of printing and writing papers , corrugated boxes , boxboard and tissue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ category , estimated at 27.7 million tons , or 12.8 percent of total generation in 1997 . This compared to 35 million tons ( 17.1 percent of total generation ) in 1990 . Food residuals constituted 10.1 percent ( 21.9 million tons ) and wood was 5.3 percent ( 11.6 million tons ) of the total MSW generated . <p> Recycling ( including composting ) recovered 28 percent ( 61 million tons ) of MSW in 1997 , one percent higher than 1996 . Paper and paperboard accounted for 42 percent ( 35 million tons ) of that total . In addition , 11.5 million tons of yard trimmings were recovered for composting , accounting for the second largest fraction of total recovery . The study notes that the percentage of yard trimmings composted ( 41 percent ) has more than doubled since 1992 . The waste characterization update is prepared for EPA by Franklin Associates . SWEDISH LANDFILL TAX <p> The Swedish Riksdag is considering a national landfill tax aimed at reducing the volume of material thrown away , rather than recycled , composted or incinerated . Only the landfilling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waste and industrial by-products , would be exempted from the levy of SEK 250 ( Euro 28 ) per metric ton , notes the magazine Swedenvironment . The tax would be paid by disposal facility operators starting January 1 , 2000 and is expected to reduce the number of landfill sites , with a concentration of larger , more specialized sites in the future . Denmark and the UK have had a similar tax for several years , and Norway adopted a national landfill and incineration tax last year .

ANALYZING WHAT GOES INTO A LANDFILL <p> The Missouri Solid Waste Composition Study was conducted by staff of the Midwest Assistance Program , Inc. and funded by the Missouri Department of Natural Resources . Over a three-year period , under the direction of project manager Dennis Siders and MSW sort supervisor Kristi Wilson , 19 landfills and transfer stations had their incoming materials separated , weighed and recorded into 26 categories . A second phase of the study observed solid waste received at 14 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ components  --  MSW , Construction , Demolition , Industrial and Other . Percentages of the various materials within each component were visually estimated and recorded . <p> The purpose of the study was to provide data to : Gauge changes in the state 's solid waste components ; Estimate the volume of recyclable materials still in Missouri solid waste ; Formulate a statewide solid waste plan ; Assist grant applications and the targeting of materials for future funding ; and Help municipal and private recycling programs . <p> One example of a disposal facility included in the study is the 70-acre Fred Weber Landfill in St. Louis County , located about 15 miles west of the city of St. Louis . During a four-day observation period , 3,040 tons of materials were received : 948 tons of MSW , 486 tons of construction , 1,047 tons of demolition , 206 tons of industrial and 353 tons of other . <p> The breakdown for the above categories , with the exception of MSW , were : Construction  --  232 tons of wood , 125 tons of drywall , 41 tons of masonry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 43 tons of cardboard and 22 tons of others ; Demolition  --  272 tons of wood , 55 tons of drywall , 245 tons of roofing , 303 tons of masonry , 55 tons of metal , 40 tons of carpet and 77 tons of others ; Industrial  --  58 tons of cardboard , 20 tons of paper , one ton of metal , 28 tons of wood , 16 tons of plastics , two tons of textiles , 81 tons of rubber and no others ; Other  --  128 tons of bulky items and 225 tons of brush , stumps and commercial yard trimmings . <p> Additional information on the study , and how it will be used , will appear in a future issue of BioCycle . MSW COMPOSTING IN QUEBEC <p> A mixed waste composting plant opened in Tracy , Quebec in 1992 . Owned and operated by Conporec , Inc. , the facility is processing about 29,000 metric tons/year of MSW and recyclables from households and businesses in Bas-Richelieu County . " We basically process municipal waste , but we also receive some biosolids and produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as out-of-date juice and dairy residue , " says Gilles Beaulieu , president of Conporec . <p> A history of the plant and its operation was described in a November , 1997 BioCycle article , " Processing Mixed MSW and Recyclables At Canadian Facility . " Briefly , residents separate recyclables and garbage . The MSW fraction is delivered to the plant , along with mixed waste from commercial accounts . After inspecting loads for contaminants , material is put into a bioreactor and composted for three to four days . Liquid from a holding tank is pumped into the bioreactor . When biosolids are received , they are added as well . Next , feedstocks from the bioreactor pass through a rotary trommel screen . The compostable fraction is conveyed to a maturation building and put into aerated windrows ; rejects are run on a conveyor belt through a sorting area . <p> The level of rejects has been fairly stable over the past few years , averaging between 23 and 25 percent , depending on the incoming waste and the season , says Beaulieu . A secondary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That has improved the physical quality of our compost by reducing glass and foreign particulates , " he adds . <p> A majority of the compost is sold to local farmers , although the highest value market is landscapers . Conporec has been involved in a four-year research and development program being conducted by Agriculture Canada that is studying farm use of compost . " The intent is to evaluate the best rate of compost to be added to different types of crops , such as corn , soy beans , potatoes and lettuce to promote the use of compost , " says Beaulieu . <p>
