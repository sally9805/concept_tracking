I WAS IN A DAMP CORRIDOR of a restaurant in Manhattan , angry because I 'd been coming regularly , feeling I 'd found something to call my own , and then they put this news clipping in the window like a flag from someone else 's country , to make me remember that indeed nothing is my own , even when I make allowances . <p> I had the notion , I think it was stamped on my head at birth in accordance with hospital regulations guiding that time in history , that the point is to gather as much information as possible ( this is why there is Manhattan ) so that you can then avoid reenacting that which exists too much ( this is why there 's the favorite anonymous spot  --  and this is why , I suspect , eventually , graffiti , copyright , the cultural chorus of claims to uniqueness , as well as every " you know " and " of course " ) . <p> This is why I got upset when they posted this clipping on the front window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her favorite undiscovered haunt . But I went in anyway , automatic pilot , not knowing what else to do , despite being caught by an image of Hollywood stars stamped over the glowing globe , foil stickers blocking out the excellent work ! of the excellent second-grader , the footprints from every boot on every construction site ever . Despite , as usual , the image  --  I mean the image is one thing , a probably psychological compulsion , but a shared , culturally inertial image is quite another  --  I went in . That is , after all , what places are for , one way or the other . Then you can own them or you can haunt them . I do n't like it , it irks me , it gets my goat when the people who own choose also to haunt . It strikes me as greedy , like wanting to be alive and dead at the same time . I went in because I did n't have an alternate plan , but a month later I moved here , to the edge of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my edgy boyfriend Roger and his enormous collection of road buttons ( buttons you find on the road ) , deflated rubber balls ( available from any playground after dark ) , other people 's discarded receipts ( bank machines , and every garbage can placed right outside every store in the universe ) , and cardboard suitcases that contain it all . <p> That is , I left as I 'd come , with stuff other people collected , because it comes with what I collect . When I was younger and living on the edge of the city , I began to notice people staying , so I left . When I saw people coming to the city , and then via the newspaper to my arbitrary spot , I left some more , surprise surprise , and old hat to boot . I said , " Roger , this Manhattan has become too much our element , and we need to bust out . " He said , " OK , it 's a plan . " We know it as such . <p> I 'm sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it again because I used to like the fact of it but I do n't really anymore . I have some mixed feelings . <p> There is an exact acre of land , I think in one of the following places if my studies serve me : Costa Rica , Madagascar , Lima , Ontario , St. James ( isle thereof ) , New Zealand , Europe , or Africa . It has never been marked as an acre distinct from others , though it is surrounded by acres that are indeed mapped . People have stomped all around it , and by virtue of some amazing , you know , thing  --  like pheromones , or a scientific anomaly that created a subtle electrical shield , ions and such , or a general , universal , unconscious belief that evil lies within that acre , some form of unsensed miracle  --  no one , as if by accident , has ever set foot on that acre or ever happened to cast a glance therein and retain the memory . One way or another , no one knows they have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , an enormous yellow bird burst straight up from the acre and through the bubble of its atmospheric capsule . Crossed that invisible line as if launched . <p> The bird is extraordinary yellow through and through : its beak , claws , eyes , its cellular membranes , intestines , and gray matter , all yellow , and the same yellow . Its blood is yellow in its body , as ours is blue . Its feces are yellow until they leave its yellow body and the air turns them as if they were fruit , but instantly . That 's what the world does to it . The bird is so yellow the feathers that fringe its wings stand stark and jagged against the sky , and the feathers that form the comb that marks the place where the yellow bones of its skull come together over its yellow brain and under its yellow skin  --  like your thumbs when you make the motion of prayer , but yellow , as if your thumbs were yellow and you were trying to drink squash soup with your hands  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comb is the picket fence that divides one half of the sky from every other half . So the bird burst out of the acre , and now it 's loose in the documented world . <p> I mention the bird only because apparently nothing but its shadow is around here . Certainly this place is quieter than Manhattan , and shadows do n't get so piled up on each other . Yesterday I decided to let Roger cut my bangs . I parted my hair down the center , put all but the front into a ponytail , and told him to make that section into the pony 's forelock . My head , a squished little pony body with no legs . " I love you because you gross me out , " said Roger . He brought a bowl of water and a razor blade onto the porch , and we settled onto the steps . " We 're doing hair outside because it 's less messy , not because we want to appropriate someone else 's territory , " he said , referring to our neighbors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black people , either of us . It 's a desperate remark , even if he does n't know it . There is a fence around our yard . Not white , but picket , at least in the front . The back is chainlink . Some people would be afraid , cutting hair outside , that pieces would blow away . They 'd be afraid an enemy would find a lock and use it to cast an evil spell . But that 's not our culture . Ours tells us that no one will notice a flitting bit of human hair , let alone recognize it as belonging to an enemy . I suppose that other culture thinks some people are simply enemies of everyone , so outside everything that they will cast an evil spell on anyone , same difference . That 's not our culture . In our culture , no one is outside enough to be or have an enemy . <p> So then Roger flipped open the bang-cutting issue of a haircuts-at-home magazine , found the column on using a razor to good purpose , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the train went through , behind all the trees , with its understated and breathy warning scream . When I was a kid we moved around a lot , but there was always a cornfield on the edge of where we were , and a train , depending on how you look at it . <p> This morning I said , " It 's time to finish the bed . " We 'd found the frame dumped in a vacant lot . It was enormous , with scaffolding for a canopy , and we had to save up to afford a mattress to fit it . For a long time we slept on the floor in our sleeping bags with the frame around us . It was better than sleeping on the old bed , which we in turn dumped in the vacant lot , telling ourselves it would be less vacant that way . We bought the mattress and box springs . Then I found old drapes at a thrift store and stretched them across the canopy part . This morning we drove forty-five minutes on secondary highways to Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I made remarks . <p> Roger is part Native American and part Colonist . His father is a street-sweeper . His mother ran away when he was twelve , taking his twin brother , Robert . His father is also a speed freak . Roger had four tattoos by the time he was fourteen . He went to art school for a while and made a few documentary films about deranged people , played sheet metal in a band for a while , went to graduate school in animal behavior for a while , and believes he has gotten three girls pregnant , but he 's not sure who because on three occasions a call came in the middle of the night and a girl told him and then hung up without saying her name or anything . I told him they could be the same girl , calling back . He said same difference , I do n't know who it is . He 's a tremendously well-built fellow , but he has a really goofy face . Not to scoff at Roger , because I do care for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how little it takes to make someone seem relevant . <p> On the other hand , I was born and then I grew up . It 's one mass of time when I look at it , a big old bowl of oatmeal . <p> We went to the Remnant Warehouse and Home Outlet . We were looking for the perfect length of tassels because we wanted to trim and thus finish our great canopy bed . Like all the rest : we were looking for the fringe element , the thing on the edge that marks off , creates , or reacts to the something it 's fringing , depending on how you look at it . It had to connote the curtains we already owned . It had to be an aspect of the bedroom palette but in a way not yet represented . I wanted it silky . He wanted each tassel big as a playhouse doll . Fine , so we want it both ways , fine . <p> The shelving units were floor-to-ceiling , all lined up like in a library . It was a library @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a library of crockery , and in another a library of wicker . So given the quest and the setting , you can see why it made sense that there was this kooky lady in the store with us . She must have been teetering on ninety , She was carrying an empty straw shoulder-bag the size of a newborn cow curled up and sleeping , embroidered with lumpy colored-straw daisies and eggplants bigger than shoes . <p> She did n't know we were in there , and we were peeking at her from between bolts of fabric the way you can peek at someone through a gap in the books at the library . What happened was that someone far away in the secret control center of the warehouse turned on the exhaust fan , and the noise it made scared her so much that she whipped around way faster than her body could handle . She could n't tell what was going on . She had no idea it was an exhaust fan high up where the roof peaked , and it made such a terrible noise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd ever done had gone and paired up with every truly awful thing in history and was rushing at her two by two with impending death . I mean that 's what I can make of it , what it must be like to be at the edge of your life in the middle of an unexplained , clattering gust . The straw bag flew from her shoulder , and she fell backward toward us . <p> Four shelving units went down like dominoes , but I remained standing . I was in the hole we 'd been peeking through . Nothing was even touching me . I was encased in solid air , and the world had gone sideways everywhere else . I could n't see the lady in the whole landscape of fabric ; she was there , then commotion and she was not , but Roger was right near me , and I was looking down at him where he was collapsed in a heap of remnants with his goofy head sticking out like old John the Baptist garnishing a salad . It was so funny I laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's the only beautiful thing he owns . You know how they say things like , " He looked crushed , " or " He 'd suffered a crushing blow . " But I really liked the way he looked like that , I liked it so much I wanted to fix everything and make it OK that we were of course in totally different universes despite our best intentions , all the time , no matter what , regardless of getting along so well and for so long . Only this time I felt I was in more than one way distinctly above him and untouched . The grand topography of remnants below , great peaked space above , the churning fan marking time from a great distance . <p> The only way I can explain the feeling  --  and it 's already as if ancient , as if legendary in my edgy life  --  is to preface by saying that even if you puzzle together everything I 've mentioned so far , and then insert your own versions of the world , or translate your terms into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like two parts of the pattern for an A-line dress or a muumuu or slick new suit , or whatever one does when one gets the feeling one knows the feeling ... I mean even if that occurs exactly as everyone hopes as soon as they say hello , the resounding effect here should be less than unity . All the little bits of my life that I 've been listing were indeed alluding to convergence : allusion in the sense of a shadow batting around , and batting like a fatty , blind , rattling bat , not even the bird it belonged to . Convergence that many times removed . There 's a form of obsessive-compulsive disorder that manifests in the afflicted becoming incapable of doing anything other than arranging the fringe on a carpet . There are lots of other things people with this disorder get attached to , but fringe-futzing is common . Fringe , as we know , is designed to be decorative and appealing because a ) it is uniform , and b ) then again it is not . Disorders , as we know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thing you can not control and then go about trying to control it . It 's manifest destiny . I bet , when this condition goes undiagnosed , eventually it 's also success , progress , innovation , and understanding . <p> So I called , over the fan , over to Roger , giggling , " Let 's get married . Let 's enter the documented world . " There was a nice length , of tassel flung over his head , not even close to what we wanted , but nice-looking nonetheless . He looked up at me , and the length flopped off . I said , " Fuck it , man , let 's just do it . Let 's just do it because so many people said it 's a cool thing to do . Let 's go back to Manhattan and get in on fast-food sushi before it 's gone . It 'll be fun . " <p> " Get me out of here , " he said , a perfectly understandable response . <p> Tonight , actually , everything feels good and pithy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we drove across tracks what , three , four times . Corn-fucking-fields everywhere , every minimall a mini-skyline . Flags in the yards of ranch-style houses , some American , but some with flowers or ladybugs , seemingly personal but actually designed to appear that way  --  mass-produced , then divvied up among garden centers . Newspapers in plastic raingear , sometimes on walkways , sometimes nestled into culverts , sometimes inconspicuously absent . Property lines in the form of surveyors ' spray paint or fluorescent ribbons flickering from trees . Old or young people , one here or there every whatever-or-so miles , walking , and you know they 're hitchhiking even though they 're not raising a thumb . A dog jumped off the back of the truck in front of us because he 'd seen a wild turkey in the brush on the side of the highway . When he rushed at the bird , it must 've been forty , fifty sparrows busted out into the sky  --  fifty dingy , identical metaphors spazzing and flapping and then diving back more or less where they came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ornery . I mean , what was I thinking ? That 's what I say to every moment I can point to . I mean , of all things , I say , shaking my head , Tsk , tsk . Every day as soon as it 's been more or less bright out , it starts getting darker , and stuff gets blurry . It continues to get darker , and at some point , at least this is what I 've been led to believe , even if I 'm busily awake or sleeping so I do n't notice what 's going on , with or without me it goes ahead , everything mushes together as far as the eye can see , and gets totally , completely , dark through and through . <p> <p> By LUCY CORIN <p>
