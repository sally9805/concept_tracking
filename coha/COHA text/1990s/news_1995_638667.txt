<p> Brighton is the type of town where everyone knows everyone . <p> That may be why there is no mud-slinging , criticizing or nitpicking in the race for mayor , which will be decided in November . So far , this is a polite political contest among five candidates who want to preserve that small-town , neighborly feeling . <p> But Brighton , suddenly on the doorstep of a brand new major airport , is about to grow up - and each contender wants to make sure it happens in a positive way . <p> " Right now , we really are sitting on the edge , " said Sue Kleve , a councilwoman and candidate . " What we have to be very careful about is , I do n't want to knock Aurora , but most of the citizens inBrighton do n't want Brighton to be Aurora . <p> " They want to keep that quality . That uniqueness , " she said . <p> Brighton , home to about 17,000 residents , is located in farm country about 25 miles north of Denver . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development - yet . <p> The candidates , all well-known , longtime residents , are eager to bridge the past with the future , focusing on smart growth and citizen involvement . They all want positive growth . <p> With so many contenders , the challenge may be to set oneself apart from the competition . <p> Their suggestions range from decreasing the city 's sales tax to transforming downtown Brighton into a hip strip of coffee shops and art galleries . Some office seekers are pushing for a citizen-based growth plan to guide the city through the changes . <p> The two-year mayoral term is critical , candidates say , because the community will decide how Brighton will develop . <p> Three candidates - Terrence " Terry " Lucero , David Rose and Kleve - point to their political experience as a bonus that residents should consider . <p> Lucero and Kleve are members of the Brighton City Council , having served eight and six years , respectively . <p> Rose is a former council member and mayor , and also challenged Mayor Don Hamstra in the mayoral election six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has served three terms in the top job , is not running for mayor this go-around . His decision has also opened the door for Barbara " Bobbi Jo " Unruh , a retired Brighton educator , and Susan Petrocco , an avid volunteer and chairwoman of the Scientific and Cultural Facilities District . <p> Lucero has no specific issues that he wants to conquer as mayor . It 's an intentional move , because he would rather push an agenda that the residents set . <p> " I 'm not a candidate that is coming in with a book of things to accomplish , " Lucero said . " I want to make sure that all the facts are heard , all the opinions are heard , and try to make a reasonable decision on all the information that comes before you . " <p> Along with listening , Lucero notes that he has more council experience than any other contender . He has also lived in Brighton his entire life . <p> Kleve also touts her insider knowledge as a bonus . <p> " I 'm running for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experienced leader focusing and guiding the council , " she said . <p> Kleve has zeroed in on the growth issue , saying the city needs to update the comprehensive growth plan with citizens ' input and to phase-in new development . <p> " If you allow development to happen the right way , you have progress , " Kleve added . " You want just enough growth to be able to make Brighton a healthy city That is possible through good planning . " <p> Rose , the third council veteran , has taken a different approach to this election . <p> He is the only candidate who has tossed a money-related campaign promise into the ring . A sales-tax decrease , he said , is critical for local businesses to compete with shops in other cities . <p> " Brighton has one of the highest sales taxes in the state , " Rose said . " Many business people are quite concerned that it 's too high . " <p> Rose proposes to cut up to one cent off the 3.75-cent sales tax , but he does not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - only suggestions . <p> Last year , Brighton collected more than $ 4.5 million in sales tax revenues . A one-cent decrease would have sliced $ 1.2 million , affecting the general fund , recreation and capital improvement budgets , according to the city . <p> Along with the tax cut , Rose said he is running for mayor because " politics is almost like a passion . " <p> " Some people have a passion for playing golf or fishing . I 've always had a real high interest in the political arena , " he said . <p> That is not the case for Unruh or Petrocco , who have no political experience . <p> Community input <p> Unruh , a retired administrator with Brighton schools , agrees that the city is at a growth crossroads . She wants to use her skills of collaboration to involve the community while organizing a public plan for Brighton 's future . <p> " I think growth and development can be planned , " Unruh said . " I want it to be a plan that the community gives a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the direction you are going to go with your growth . " <p> Several candidates back the idea of updating the comprehensive growth plan , but Unruh separates herself from the pack in another area . She is willing to commit more time to the top job . <p> " I 'm retired , " Unruh said , " I do have more time available than the other candidates . " <p> Petrocco , who has served on various community and civic boards , has big ideas to help Brighton 's struggling downtown . She suggests that a developer buy out the two-block area to build cafes , art galleries and lofts in the century-old buildings . <p> " Main Street is not an image-builder , " Petrocco said . " I want to see a mini-LoDo if you will . I want to see some development . " <p> She also wants to tap the cultural diversity in this rural city . Thanks to Petrocco , Brighton is now organizing a cultural council to consider art , music and entertainment projects throughout the community . <p> Thousands of dollars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murals , but the city has never applied for grants to fund these types of programs . <p> " There is so much more we can do , " she said . " Brighton is like a well-kept secret . I just want to maintain that We are really like a rainbow . We have so many colors , diverse cultures .
