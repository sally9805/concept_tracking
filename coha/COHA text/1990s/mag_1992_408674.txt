Traveling by commercial jet is about as thrilling as riding a rush-hour bus . Creating that jet , on the other hand , rings of grand adventure . It is today 's equivalent of building the Panama Canal or the transcontinental railroad  --  a glamorous and romantic task that is so costly , so risky , so technically demanding , that only a handful of companies in the world dare to do it . The corporation that tries to make a genuinely new model of a large commercial aircraft can expect to spend about $5 billion over five years or so before getting anything back . If the project is a success , the company will have created a marvelous , beautiful machine that will circle the earth ceaselessly , safely , and profitably for decades to come . But if the effort fails , the company will be crippled , if not broken . In its bid to build a plane for the 21st century , Boeing Co. has taken on all these perils and then added an extra level of risk by designing it in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , medium-to long-range wide-body scheduled to go into service in May 1995 , will be the company 's first plane designed entirely on computers . Boeing 's three-dimensional digital design system comes with its own computer-generated human model who crawls into the images on the screen to show how difficult it would be for a real person to reach the problem area and make a repair . The system enables Boeing to skip the usual paper drawings and full-scale mock-up , going straight from computer images to building the real thing . In the past , planes sprang straight from the brains of Boeing 's renowned design engineers . This time the design process reflects the views of the airlines that will fly the plane , the mechanics who will maintain it , and the many others who will help build it , price it , and market it . Some 235 " design/build " teams , whose members are drawn from all these groups , are creating the detailed plans for the plane . More than ever before , Boeing is relying on Japanese partners to help manufacture the plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get early approval from the Federal Aviation Administration to fly a twin jet on long over-water routes . Despite the extraordinary reliability of modern jet engines , aviators prefer four engines when they are a long way from an airport . " The 777 causes me to sit bolt upright in bed periodically , " admits Dean Thornton , president of Boeing 's Commercial Airplane Group . He looks like a relaxed , self-confident man who normally does n't lose much sleep . " It 's a hell of a gamble , " he continues . " There 's a big risk in doing things totally differently . It 's not going to fail , but the degree of success is uncertain . It depends on the market . " The market is n't promising right now . Eastern , Midway , and Pan American folded last year ; America West , Continental , and TWA are in Chapter 11 . But Boeing 's economists foresee passenger miles more than doubling worldwide by 2005 . They estimate that between replacing old planes and adding new ones , the world 's airlines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . Even so , why should Boeing have taken such a jumbo risk ? It 's not as if it were in trouble and had to resort to desperate gambles . On a scale virtually unmatched by any other U.S. corporation , it dominates its world market and is the nation 's largest exporter . Although Boeing is losing military business , the commercial backlog stands at 1,605 aircraft , and the four current models-the 737 , 747 , 757 , and 767  --  all sell profitably . The 777 will fill the niche between the 218-passenger 767 and the 419-passenger 747 . What Boeing hopes to secure with the 777 is the future . " This is an offensive , not a defensive , strategy , " says Phil Condit , the executive vice president who runs the 777 program . Japan patiently strengthens its aerospace capability by supplying more and more parts to foreign manufacturers , getting ready for the day when it could become a major competitor . Airbus Industrie , the four-nation European consortium , keeps building market share with advanced new aircraft . The remaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could soon have entree to the rich Pacific market through an alliance with Taiwan Aerospace Corp . When it faces these rivals as a designer , Boeing is preeminent , but as a manufacturer it is just average . With each succeeding jet , more of the actual building gets farmed out . " Is this the beginning of the hollowing out of Boeing ? " asks John Ettlie , director of manufacturing management research at the University of Michigan 's business school . " I have great respect for them , but they have a long way to go in manufacturing . " Therefore , to stay on top , Boeing must find ways of building planes better . If Boeing 's new approach to design works  --  and so far , as engineers complete the designs and turn to preparations for manufacturing , it is doing well  --  the 777 will be an efficient , economic plane with a lot fewer bugs than new planes usually have . As a result , Boeing could save the millions it usually spends in fixing design problems during production and after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair , as risks go , the 777 is n't quite in the same class as the 747 or the 767 . Boeing bet the company on both those planes , but this time around , it has a healthy $3 billion in cash . Still , should the 777 flop , business historians a generation from now might point to it as the beginning of the the challenge . The 777 spills superlatives . Its digital design uses the largest cluster of mainframe computers in the world , eight IBM 3090-6OOJs . The finished plane will roll out through doors almost as big as football fields . The plant itself , at Everett , Washington , which builds the 747 and the 767 , already covers as much land as 45 football fields , and will swell to the size of 76 to accommodate the 777 assembly line . The plane will be Boeing 's first fly-by-wire aircraft , which means that the pilot 's commands will be transmitted electrically rather than mechanically to the rudder and flaps . Its twin engines will be the largest and most powerful ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a thrust or propulsive power , of between 71,000 and 85,000 pounds , compared with about 57,000 pounds of the latest 747 engine . The cockpit will be crammed with new electronics and also liquid-crystal displays that will lead the pilot through his checklists and carry written messages to and from the airport controllers when the voice channels get too crowded around rush hour . Aircraft makers say it is time to stop designing and to start building when the weight of the paper exceeds the weight of the plane . That rule of thumb wo n't work for the 777 because all the designs are inside the memory of the project 's eight IBM mainframes . Paper drawings are run off for the use of senior executives who do n't have terminals in their offices , but 100% of the design will be created digitally . Boeing has used computer-aided design before but has never relied so totally on the computer , skipping not only the paperwork but also the full-size metal and wood mock-up that designers have always built to test their drawings . Being three-dimensional and caple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the pieces fit together . If two parts clash  --  say a tube ca n't get around a spar  --  the problem shows up on the screen . The digital system  --  called Catia ( for computer-aided , three-dimensional , interactive application )  --  came from Dassault Aviation in France , where it was used to help build French fighter planes . IBM and Boeing enhanced the software to detect clashes , Boeing 's term for parts that either do not fit or can not work with each other the way they are suppose to . In the process , they created Catia-man , a computer-simulated human who can climb inside the three-dimensional images and play the role of the mechanic . Catia-man recently discovered that a human mechanic would not be able to reach the red navigation light on the roof of the plane to change the bulb . Without the limber model , says Condit , " we might not have out about the bulb until we built a mock-up , or until final assembly , or even until some airline called to say we 've got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light bulb . " The design teams and the computers are not meant to speed delivery of the 777  --  the time from first contract to first arrival of the plane will be about 55 months , compared with 50 months for 767 . But they are meant to make a better plane from the outset . Typically , engineers are still designing when manufacturing begins , and they keep making changes as problems show up in the factories and on the flight lines . Tools and dies and maintenance manuals have to be reworded and unsable parts scrapped . When the 747-400 started flying passengers three years ago , Boeing had to assign an extra 300 engineers to the plane to get rid of bugs that had n't been spotted earlier . The 777 teams and computers are supposed to find these bugs before they show up at the plant , much less in the air . With all the engineers looking at the same up-to-date data on their screens , they can see and work out conflicts . They can call up the name and phone number of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly to solve clashes . By putting in effort and money up front , Boeing hopes to make a plane that is really ready for service when it 's delivered . Like other proud , successful engineering companies , Boeing used to figure it knew what was best for the customer . When in the mid-1980s it began thinking about producing a new plane , it tried at first to sell the airlines on a bigger , better 767 . But , says Alan Mulally , vice president of engineering for the 777 , " the airlines kept telling us , " No , Boeing , you 're not listening . ' ' " Phil Condit outlines Boeing 's response : " We did what I call aggressive listening . We really tried to understand what the customers were telling us . " In the jargon of the day , the 777 is a consumer-driven product . Starting in 1986 , dozens of Condit 's people traveled extensively , visiting airports and airlines , talking to pilots , passengers , and mechanics , and soaking up ideas . What they heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passengers and a 747-400 with seats for 419 is too big to fill by stretching the 767 . Airlines need to fine-tune their fleets to fit their routes fairly closely . A route with too many passengers for a 767 might not provide enough for a 747 to operate profitably , but a plane with 300-plus seats could be just the right size . As it happens , that slot is partially filled now by old McDonnell Douglas DC-10s and Lockheed L-1011s that will begin retiring in the mid-1990s , just as the 777 comes into service . The competition is aware of this gap in the market too . McDonnell Douglas got in the slot first with the three-engine MD-11 , which has been flying passengers for a year . There are 136 firm orders and 157 options for the MD-11 , a derivative of the DC-10 . Airbus Industrie , which Boeing regards as its most serious competitor , has 258 orders for its two entries in this class , the twin-engine A330 and the four-engine A340 . The A340 will go into service early in 1993 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late to market has n't hurt Boeing in the past because the company profited by the mistakes of others and arrived with advanced technology . Boeing learned from its clients that they wanted not just one 777 but an eventual family of planes built around the basic model . Since all the members of the family can share maintenance , parts , training , and operating procedures , an airline can save money while serving different markets . The first 777 that appears in 1995 will be a basic version of the three-class , medium-range plane that can carry 328 passengers 5,000 nautical miles . The long-range version ( 6,400 nautical miles ) will follow in 1996 and seat a maximum of 328 passengers in three classes as well . These two could lead to stretch versions carrying 20% more passengers . By October 1990 , Boeing had configured the basic plane , and United Airlines put the 777 program in business by placing the first order for 34 of the aircraft . It has an option to buy 34 more at a price between $106 million and $129 million apiece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers can order engines from other manufacturers . With United 's order in hand , the Boeing board approved the 777 , and the engineers at project headquarters in Renton , near Seattle , began fine-tuning their designs early in 1991 . In the past United would have placed its order and then sat back for four years awaiting delivery . This time United is right in there with Boeing and its engineers , along with the representatives of the suppliers and other airlines . " We have definitely influenced the design of the aircraft , " says United 's 777 program manager , Gordon McKinzie , who works out of a Boeing office in Renton . For example , Boeing usually installed one very long panel under the leading edge of the wing to allow access to the slat mechanisms . ( Slats perform a similar function to flaps , increasing lift on take-offs and landings . ) " It was a nightmare for our mechanics , " says McKinzie . " They had to remove scores of screws just to check out one problem . " The solution was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the cabin , United and a potential customer , American Airlines , persuaded Boeing to redesign the cover plates for reading lamps . Now a flight attendant , informed by a central panel that a bulb has burned out , will simply stick in a new one . The repair does n't have to wait for a mechanic . Besides United 's legions , many more people have become intimately involved in creating the 777 : Representatives from other airline customers , engine manufacturers , pilots , mechanics , and scores of suppliers , from the Japanese manufacturers of fuselage parts to the British suppliers of flight computers  --  all found their way to Renton . So have Boeing people who would not normally have much say about design  --  manufacturing engineers , plant representatives , and finance and marketing experts . Many of them sit on the design/build teams . For the first time , this Boeing project has a chief mechanic , Jack Hessburg , representing the people who will maintain the plane , forgotten players in the past . Hessburg has a mechanical engineering degree , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has shown up at meetings in Renton with a big red mechanic 's towel hanging out of his rear pants pocket . " The gate mechanic touches a plane more than anyone , " he says , and the ones he brought in both from Boeing and from the airlines told the design engineers things they never knew . For example , a Japanese mechanic politely expressed his frustration at working in the most congested part of previous Boeings , the electronics and electrical bay under the cockpit . The door to the panel he was working on would swing shut , and his head would block the light . You ca n't do your best , he said , while holding a flashlight between your teeth and bracing the panel door open with your backside . Solution : Put a latch on the door to prop it open and move the light . The biggest group of outsiders at Renton come from Japan . They are the emissaries of a consortium made up of Fuji Heavy Industries , Kawasaki Heavy Industries , and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries that has worked with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plays a bigger role with each new wide-body model . The consortium builds 15% of the 767 's fuselage and will be making 20% of the 777 's . Shin-ichi Nakagawa of Mitsubishi , who heads the group of 250 Japanese engineers working in the U.S. on the 777 , was among the first Japanese sent to Seattle 19 years ago for the 747 . After working alongside Americans at their terminals in Renton a year or more , most of Nakagawa 's engineers are heading back to Japan to shift to production design . They will be linked directly into the digital design system in Renton . The fuselage will be built in sections in Japan and shipped to that immense plant in Everett . The Japanese are familiar with teams of design and production engineers , says Nakagawa , but they have n't experienced Boeing 's all-embracing teams that include customers , suppliers , and support people . They are grouped into sections for each of the main pieces of the plane . Section 41 , for instance , is responsible for the nose of the aircraft and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the roof , the floor , the flight deck , and so forth . Each team determines its own mix of insiders and outsiders . All this sharing-with-outsiders stuff does n't come naturally to the straight arrows bred in the Boeing culture . A visit to headquarters leaves an impression of a top management made up mostly of men with British last names , mixed with a few teeth-crunching Germanic ones . They have a proud corporate history and the can-do , tight-lipped attitude of military elite . Says Neil Standal , who manages the 777 subcontractors : " At first , people were reluctant to ask questions in team meetings , but now you have to shut them up . " To let everyone know that the 777 project is different and that it is okay to step outside the box of Boeing tradition , the company issued team members teal golf shirts with white 777 logos and encouraged employees to wear them to work  --  but only on Fridays . This is Boeing , after all . The man at the center of the new culture is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mobile grin and the jug ears of a Dwight Eisenhower . He stands a good chance of becoming president of the commercial aircraft division , Boeing 's largest , and eventually chairman of the whole company , if he can suceessfully guide all the complexities of the 777 program . In any earlier project , he says , most of his time would have been spent solving technical and contracting problems . " Now , " he adds , " I spend 70% to 80% of my time on people issues . It is phenomenally important to tell everyone what is going on , and I use every device I can get my hands on . " These include orientation sessions , question-and-answer sessions , information sheets , and just a lot of meetings with everyone from customers to production workers . Condit has a tremendous advantage personally in that he can explain esoteric matters in clear , forceful language , and with some passion when he talks about the 777 . Boeing wants early permission from the FAA to fly long over-water routes , like California to Hawaii , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three years . That flight takes planes more than two hours ' flying time away from any airport , an exceptionally long distance . What makes the goal of early approval controversial is that the 777 has only two engines . Normally , the FAA would first certify a twin-engine plane for flights not more than one hour from an airport , then two hours , and finally , after a couple of years ' service , a full three hours so the plane could fly anywhere in the world . What Boeing wants is three-hour certification  --  what aviators call Etops for extended-range twin-engine operations-immediately . And it has developed an elaborate test program to get it . Condit argues that the reliability of jet engines has reached the point where the " engine count " is no longer a safety issue . In-flight jet engine failures have become so rare they do n't even figure statistically . Kenneth Waldrip , a Northwest 747 captain who heads the new aircraft evaluation committee for the Air Line Pilots Association , thinks Boeing should get high marks for the new plane but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every time we get a new engine , we always get a surprise . " He sees two engines as the wave of the future because they are more fuel efficient and cost less to maintain , but for extra security he prefers four . Says Waldrip : " If you 've got four engines and one quits , its no big deal , but if one quits on a twin-engine plane , things get dicey . " The FAA wo n't certify the 777 for any service unless it is convinced that the plane can take off and fly on one engine . Says Anthony Broderick , associate FAA administrator for regulation and certification : " This will be the most thoroughly tested and proven plane ever on the day the first passenger steps aboard , but we have not guaranteed early Etops . " That is one more risk Boeing must take . Despite the pressures on him , Condit retains his **36;39;TOOLONG attitude . " My strong feeling is that you retain your competitive position by continuously improving what you do , " he says . " Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best planes in the world . " The 777 will be the best test so far of Boeing 's ability to do that . <p>
