Genius takes many forms . In the case of Florida coach Steve Spurrier , it has taken the form of offensive creativity  --  the beloved ball plays , as he calls them , that propelled the Gators in seven years from outlaw mediocrity to last season 's national championship . But there can also be genius in a simple phone call , such as the one Spurrier made to Kansas State codefensive coordinator Bob Stoops in the winter of 1996 , offering him the defensive coordinator 's position at Florida . That small piece of fiber-optic business paid a huge dividend in the Gators ' 33-20 victory over Tennessee last Saturday and has at least temporarily turned the Florida program on its head . It 's true the Gators still lack balance : Now their defense is much better . // As Florida sent the Volunteers into consolation mode for the fifth consecutive year ( and quarterback Peyton Manning for the fourth ) , Spurrier 's offense relied almost exclusively on the big-play receiving of junior wideout Jacquez Green ( eight catches for 185 yards ) and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 17 carries , after only three yards on one carry in the first half ) . The Gators looked as if they were still struggling to replace last year 's Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback , Danny Wuerffel , and the two wide receivers taken in the first round of the NFL draft , Reidel Anthony and Ike Hilliard. // The defense , on the other hand , was relentless . It intercepted Manning twice , sacked him twice , pressured him on at least a dozen more of his 51 passes and made him suffer for his 353 passing yards . The Gators also held Tennessee to 45 yards on 20 rushing attempts . In the dressing room after the game , Spurrier gave Stoops a game ball for the third time in his two years in Gainesville. // Moments later Spurrier leaned against a wall outside the coaches ' dressing room , sipped from an orange can of sports drink ( guess which one ) , savored the victory that would vault the Gators to No. 1 and thanked heaven for Stoops 's presence . " Shoot , yes , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Spurrier said , running a hand through his sweat-matted hair . " Can you imagine this game in the old days ? If we played that bad on offense back then , we 'd have had it very tough . Might not have won at all . " // Those old days would be Spurrier 's first six years as Florida 's coach ( 1990 to ' 95 ) , when he honed the Gators ' offensive edge but lost four games in which Florida scored 28 points or more , and won or tied four others in which the opposition ran up 30 or more . Spurrier 's philosophy was simple : Outscore everybody . The flaw in that thinking was exposed in the national-championship game following the ' 95 season , in which Nebraska treated the . Gators like tadpoles as it rang up a 62-24 Fiesta Bowl victory . Meanwhile Stoops had built a unit at Kansas State that led the nation in total defense and probably in total attitude . On the statistics alone , Spurrier called . // He got himself an assistant for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bob Stoops 's father , Ron , was the defensive coordinator at Cardinal Mooney High in Youngstown , Ohio , for 30 years , until his death in 1988 . Bob 's brother Mike , 34 , worked with him at Kansas State and is now defensive coordinator for the Wildcats . Another brother , Mark , 30 , coaches defensive backs at Wyoming , and a third , Ron Jr. , 40 , is defensive coordinator at Boardman High in Boardman , Ohio . " It had to be something with my dad , " says Bob . " We all understand defense pretty well . " Bob , 37 , was a four-year starter as ( what else ? ) a defensive back at Iowa . He became codefensive coordinator at Kansas State in 1991 and there developed many of the attacking schemes that are now immensely popular in the college game . // Stoops approached Tennessee as a professional and personal challenge . His pet blitz packages and bump-and-run coverages would be severely tested because Manning is such a gifted passer , with superb vision and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him in three seconds or less , because he 's going to be effective if you do n't , " Stoops said after Saturday 's victory . On the personal level Stoops was angry that the Volunteers constantly talked about their " comeback " in last fall 's game against Florida , which Tennessee lost 35-29 after trailing 35-0 . The Vols scored their last touchdown in that game with just 10 seconds to play . " It was silly , " Stoops said . " We backed out of our blitzes and made them use time to score . They picked their way up the field with short stuff . It did n't even seem like they were trying to win . " // A single play on Saturday  --  perhaps the most significant of the game  --  illustrated Stoops 's high-risk defensive philosophy . With the Gators leading 7-0 in the final minute of the first quarter and Tennessee facing third-and-11 on the Florida 24 , Stoops sent right cornerback Elijah Williams on a blitz from bump-and-run coverage far outside the interior line , a huge risk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced a horrible throw into the middle of the field . It was intercepted by junior strong safety Tony George , who ran 89 yards for a touchdown and a 14-0 lead . The Vols never really recovered . // The interception was the biggest play in a huge game for George , a 5 ' 11 " , 200-pound fourth-year junior who , like his coordinator , is a child of the Midwest . George also helped sack Manning once , had three solo tackles , broke up two passes , forced one fumble and recovered another . He 's a prime example of the huge talent pool that may keep the Gators in the Top 5 for years to come . George sat behind 1996 Thorpe Award winner Lawrence Wright for two seasons before being elevated to starter this year , and there 's no more certain indicator of a team 's arrival as a powerhouse than its ability to replace quality with more of the same . George , in fact , chose Florida over Tennessee because Gators coaches told him he would sit and mature as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Volunteers did n't offer . " Tennessee was talking about playing right away , and I did n't want any part of that , " he says . // His interception was prosaic  --  the product of solid coverage and heavy pressure on the quarterback  --  but his runback was poetry . He slid to the left sideline and then rolled past the Gators ' bench . Twenty yards from the end zone , George raised his right hand toward the sky . Sitting in the players ' family section of Ben Hill Griffin Stadium , among the school-record crowd of 85,714 , was 15-year-old Tari George . Tony 's gesture was for her , another message among many from her big brother . " Everything I do is for her , " Tony says . " I started thinking about her as soon as I reached the sideline and turned up . " // Tony , who grew up in Cincinnati , was six years old when Tari was born , the last of six children of their mother , Arizona , and father , Houston . At two , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably caused by oxygen deprivation during birth . Her left side is very weak . She walks with a limp , and her left arm just hangs when she moves . Tari would often play in the same parks where Tony played basketball and baseball with his friends , and when other kids would make fun of Tari , Tony would take them on . Then , one afternoon when he was 15 , Tony took a different approach . " I decided not to fight , " he says . " I just told them all to try to do what Tari does . Try to tie your shoes with one hand . " // She would reward him for his courage with some of her own in the fall of 1991 , when Tony was a sophomore at Winton Woods High . At home after football practice one night he had to run to use the bathroom constantly and was eventually taken to the hospital , where doctors told him that he was diabetic and would require two insulin shots a day for the rest of his life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tari visited him at the hospital . " She walked in , looked at me and said . ' Oh , do n't be silly , you 're going to be O.K. , ' " says Tony . " I mean , how could I feel sorry for myself after that ? " Tari and Tony inspire each other now , she pushing him to compete and succeed , he reminding her that she 's not alone in her daily struggle . // It was dark and humid on Saturday evening when George popped through a metal door beneath the south end zone of the stadium . Three fans handed him a poster to sign and then politely left . Twenty yards away Arizona stood wearing her son 's white number 1 jersey from the 19% Fiesta Bowl . " He waited for his time to shine , " she said , gently nodding . " Yes , he did ; he waited for his time . " // A slender teenage girl approached from Tony 's left , smiling demurely . Tari put her strong right arm around Tony 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and kissed her on the cheek . Together they swayed gently in the night , and only then was Tony 's newfound stardom made full .
