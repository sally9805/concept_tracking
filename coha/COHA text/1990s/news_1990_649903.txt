<p> Seldom has there been a more blatant case of blaming the victim than those pious American demands , during Nelson Mandela 's visit here , that he renounce violence as a political instrument . <p> Mr. Mandela made the proper answer on the White House lawn . The violent and repressive Government of South Africa , he said , had given his people " no alternative but to resort to violence . " Once that Government " removed all obstacles to negotiation " - which it has not yet done despite its belated change for the better under F.W. de Klerk - the A.N.C . " would consider the cessation of hostilities . " <p> To his credit , President Bush apparently had expected this obvious response and did not appear to let it affect his welcome or his admiration for the great South African . That does not remove the taint of hypocrisy from U.S. talk of nonviolence to a leader who spent 27 years as a political prisoner , owing to information provided to a brutal Government by the C.I.A . <p> Nor should any American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ status of apartheid in South Africa , even after the recent reforms . Who in Washington knows better than Mr. Mandela what the Afrikaner minority still must concede before the huge black majority can claim anything like equality and security ? <p> Demands for nonviolence , moreover , ill become a U.S. Administration that with ample Congressional support invaded Panama and killed four times more civilians than Panamanian soldiers , and 26 Americans - all in pursuit of one alleged criminal it may not even be able to convict . <p> Violence was a prime tool of the Reagan Administration , of which George Bush was second in command , when the U.S. bombed Libya on the assumption that Muammar el-Qaddafi had ordered acts of terror in West Germany , when it mounted an amphibious conquest of the formidable island of Grenada , and when it armed , trained and financed the contras to achieve U.S. goals in Nicaragua . <p> All that violence resulted from Government policy ; but the record of Americans acting privately may be worse . In 1987 , for example , they murdered 4,223 men aged 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young American men , which makes this country the unchallenged killing champion of the world . <p> Not by a narrow margin , either . Figures published last month by the National Center for Health Statistics show that the nearest competitor was Scotland , where 5 young men per 100,000 were murdered , a quarter of the U.S. rate . And murders of men aged 15 to 24 account for only one-fifth of a U.S. total that probably has risen since 1987 , because homicide has been happening more often since crack cocaine came into wide use . <p> South Africa was not rated , perhaps due to incomplete statistics or maybe to the number of eligible young men still in prison for political reasons - one of those obstacles to negotiation and an end to violence that Nelson Mandela cited . <p> " We 're so immersed in violence " - here in the nation that urged nonviolence on Mr. Mandela - that homicide is a " large and important health problem , " in the judgment of Dr. James Mercy of the injury division at the Centers for Disease Control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100,000 , is in fact the leading cause of death among young American black men - a prime reason why another recent study found that young men in Harlem are less likely to reach age 40 than are young men in Bangladesh , one of the poorest and most overcrowded of all nations . <p> In Michigan , the most dangerous state for young black men , they were murdered in 1987 at the rapid rate of 232 per 100,000 - 10 times the rate for all young American men . Even in the " safest " states for young black men ( North Carolina and Kentucky ) they were murdered far more often than the overall national rate and seven times the rate for all young men in any foreign nation . No wonder American black men , at a recent public hearing in New York , were termed " a hunted and endangered species . " <p> The endemic violence of American life sometimes is glibly attributed to a frontier heritage . But in Australia , a nation no further past its frontier days than the U.S. , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over a tenth of the American rate . There is , however , one peculiarly American factor : the easy availability and prevalence of guns . <p> A firearm , consequently , was the weapon of choice in 75 percent of those 4,223 murders of young American men in 1987 . Does a nation that ca n't even ban assault rifles from its streets have a right to lecture Nelson Mandela on the evils of violence ? Tell it to the American Indians - what 's left of them .
