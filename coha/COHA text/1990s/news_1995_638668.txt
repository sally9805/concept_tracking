<p> Athletic and active baby boomers who once could go out and play a game of touch football on Saturday , followed by softball on Sunday , now find themselves morose - and in pain - on Monday . <p> The weekend warriors of a few years ago are becoming the weekend wounded . <p> And they 're showing up more often in local doctors ' offices . <p> " I do think the injuries we 're seeing ( in weekend athletes ) are a little more frequent , " said Dr. Kevin Boyle , a family practitioner at Columbine Medical Center . " As people get older , they overestimate what they can do . " <p> Typically , said Boyle , the patient is a man in his late 30s or early 40s who gets together with the guys on the weekend to play basketball or football , or crank out a few innings of softball at the company picnic . He probably does n't do much else that 's active during the week . <p> " And he forgets that he is n't in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , soon to be 40 , who recently went to see Boyle because of a strained hamstring , said his was the seventh such injury the doctor had seen in just a couple of weeks . <p> But hamstrings are n't the only culprits . " It 's everything , " said Boyle , " mostly lower extremity stuff , recurrent sprained ankles , knees . And shoulders , from throwing too hard . " Mountain bikers are joining the weekend wounded with injuries sustained in accidents caused by going downhill too fast , he added . <p> Dr. Rob Loeffler , an orthopedic surgeon and head of the University of Colorado Sports Medicine Center , agreed that weekend-warrior injuries are more prevalent - and women are just as susceptible . <p> Aside from the CU and University of Denver athletes he treats , the majority of his patients who require surgery are " in their late 30s to early 40s , people who 've been active most of their lives , " said Loeffler . " They take up or continue to do ( a sport ) without concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the increased conditioning that 's required . " <p> Most risky are the periodic sports done at high intensity , with basketball at the top of the list , said Loeffler . <p> And knees are the No.1 injured part - although shoulders get their fair amount of shock from throwing in weekend football and softball leagues or pickup games in the park , he said . <p> As we age , muscles and joints become stiffer and less flexible . That , combined with a population that is increasingly busy with families and careers and with less time to exercise regularly , adds up to problems , said Dr. Wayne Gersoff , director of the Rose Sports Medicine Clinic . <p> Even someone who may think they 're in shape - because , say , they jog once or twice a week - may have problems with weekend sports . <p> " There 's a big difference in jogging and sprinting , like you 'd do in a football or softball game , " said Gersoff . " It 's the sudden bursts ( of activity ) that get you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injuries tend to be more serious and also take more time to heal , added Loeffler . And while the social and corporate costs of that are n't often talked about , they 're beginning to add up . <p> But there 's a relatively easy , and cost-effective solution to all this : regular preventive maintenance . A minimum of 20 to 30 minutes at least three times a week is necessary to stay in shape for weekend activity , and the exercise needs to address three concerns : flexibility , strength and endurance . <p> You get flexibility from a stretching program , which becomes " real important once you hit 40 , " said Loeffler . One of the most common - and debilitating - injuries to people over 40 who do weekend activity without being in good shape is to the Achilles ' tendon . " That 's completely preventable by stretching , " he said . <p> You get endurance by doing sustained exercise on a bike or treadmill , and strength comes from working with weights . If you stick to one activity exclusively , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example , would strengthen your legs and provide increased endurance . <p> For people who play noontime or weekend basketball , a good flexibility program with ballet-type stretching is one of the keys to minimizing risk of injury , according to the National Athletic Trainers Association . Players also should work on agility with jump rope and hopscotch-type exercises . <p> " We suggest that athletes get in shape to play - do n't play to get in shape , " said Mike Saunders , a head athletic trainer for the New York Knicks and a member of the NATA . " Players who begin without a minimum fitness level will probably sustain an injury . " <p> Meanwhile , weekend footballers should do that general maintenance exercise as well as concentrate on warming up properly . A light jog around the field at about half-speed , plus gentle stretching of the main muscles , is recommended , says a release from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center . <p> Leg muscles vulnerable <p> Muscles most vulnerable to injury in a game of football are the hamstring along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back of the heel and adductor muscles inside the thigh , said the release . <p> If that leap-into-the-end-zone slide does end in an " uh-oh " feeling in your hamstring , your first inclination might be to go home and get in a hot bath and soak away the pain . <p> Do n't . <p> " That 's the absolute worst thing you can do for an injury , " said Rose 's Gersoff . <p> Instead , get some ice from the cooler and immediately apply it to the injured muscle . Continue to apply ice at home and again the next few days as you start to try to move on the muscle . Other antidotes are rest and , if appropriate , compression . If the injury is to a lower extremity , like an ankle , elevating is also indicated . <p> But even if you 're one of those weekend wounded who has been sidelined , your playing days do n't have to be over . <p> " An injury , provided they can come back from it , is a good learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They realize , ' Maybe I 'm not as young as I used to be , ' but most of them do get back to their sport . " <p> One other thing : Do n't assume you 'll be able to come back as fast as Michael Dean Perry of the Broncos , who was injured and underwent arthroscopic surgery barely three weeks ago , but was expected to be back in yesterday 's game . <p> " Coming back too soon is the one of the things I fight against all the time , " said Loeffler . Weekend athletes see someone like Perry recover quickly and assume they can do the same . <p> They 're in another league <p> " You have to remember those guys usually are younger , they 're in good shape to begin with , and then when they get hurt , they have a trainer who works with them six or eight hours a day , " he said . <p> " These pros and how fast they come back gives everybody a false perception of reality , " added Gersoff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortcut to recovery but that rehabilitation " becomes their job . They 're doing it all day . " <p> Enough recovery time is a key to being able to return to the sport , he added . <p> " The biggest reason for reinjury or prolonged healing is that people do n't allow themselves enough time , " said Gersoff . <p> IF YOU DO GET INJURED <p> Should you see a doctor ? And should it be a sports medicine specialist ? <p> Dr. Wayne Gersoff of Rose Sports Medicine Clinic said that doctors " probably do n't see half " of the weekend sports injuries that occur , as people try to recover on their own or avoid the cost of medical treatment . <p> And that 's probably OK , he said . Unless you 're really in severe pain and unable to walk or move the injured part , you 're probably safe in pursuing a rest-ice-compression program at home . <p> " It should feel significantly better in a week , " he said . <p> And remember : No hot tubs , either right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . When a muscle is torn or otherwise injured , its tiny blood vessels bleed , which causes inflammation and swelling . Heat further dilates those vessels , which can make recovery more prolonged and more painful , said Gersoff . <p> The Penn State Sports Medicine Newsletter notes that if you do decide a doctor 's help is necessary , it is n't necessary to first seek a physician in sports medicine . <p> " Go to your primary care physician first , " advises the newsletter . " At least half of exercise-related injuries can be treated by either generally primary-care physicians or PCPs who specialize in sports medicine . "
