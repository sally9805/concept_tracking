As the lights come up , we see MARILUZ as a child playing with the ANGELS . They join arms and skip while they sing " Arroz Con Leche . " MARILUZ &amp; THE ANGELS ( Singing ) " Arroz con leche se quiere casar con una vuidita de la capital , que sepa tejer , que sepa bordar , que ponga la aguja en el mismo lugar . Tiln , tiln , sopitas de pan , all viene Juan , comiendo ese flan . Si no me lo dan , me como a Juan me pongo a llorar " ( MARILUZ pulls herself away from the children and moves into her apartment . MARILUZ holds up a faded , once pink and blue , satin rag . The piece of cloth is now more gray from age and use , but clean . SHE holds this folded piece of cloth to her lips and kisses it . MARILUZ unfolds the rag to reveal a plastic mini-statue of the Virgin Mary . As MARILUZ begins to speak , the ANGELS may play and tease her in silence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MARILUZ ( Speaking to the little statue of the Virgin Mary ) Remember how I lost you once ? I was jumping over stones , pretending that each one was a beautiful boy who wanted to marry me . ANGELS ( Singing ) " Contigo si , contigo no , contigo mi vida me casame yo . " p. 3 MARILUZ No , not you Mr. Greyrock With Stripes . Not you Mr. Redstone . Or especially you , Mr. Pebble . You fell out of my pocket and rolled under one of those loose pieces of mountain . But the Sun made me find you . It shined on your face and that special light that comes from you could n't help but be seen . ( Pause ) I 'm sorry I had to bring you so far from home . Mami would hate that I still have you . And I do n't blame her . You 're beautiful even though your hands are n't real . They 're just painted on  --  not even carved  --  not even deep . That 's strange for a virgin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hard into the secret parts of this plastic that no one else ever touched before . And  --  excuse me , Mary , but you need a tan too . You 're the palest Mary  --  whiter than the insides of my eyes maybe you 're sick too . If I 'd been the one who made you , you 'd be dark and beautiful . Your eyes would be black and your robe would be dark blue to make your eyes and hair shine . And your skin glow . ( Pause ) My skin 's all crazy now . You see these marks ? They were n't there last week . Funny how quickly things happen . ( The ANGELS sing . ) ANGELS " Contigo si , contigo no , contigo mi vida me casame yo . " ( THEY all point at FELIPE. ) p. 4 MARILUZ Like my husband . ( Lights come up on the sleeping figure of FELIPE . ) He came to me after forty years of my being just like you , Blessed Mary . Blessed Mary , my mother was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had children already  --  but not me . I waited to meet someone special . And I did  --  on Thanksgiving Day . Is n't that right , Felipe ? You 're lucky you can sleep so much . I almost never sleep . I sit up at night thinking about things that used to be . I remember how good you looked to me that day , Felipe . I knew I would marry you . You needed a wife  --  that 's what I told myself . " That man needs a woman and it 's going to be me . " Cooked every meal for you from that day on . Cooked a turkey on the day we first met . My brother-in-law brought it home from the factory for me to cook for his family , but I brought it down to your apartment and we ate it together . Never left your side since then Since that day when Mami cursed me . ( Pause ; returning to speak to the Virgin Mary statuette . ) Mami did not want me to marry Felipe . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to throw dirt on your grave . " I think she 'll get her wish . ( Pause ) I hear that curse in my head every time I have to go to the doctor . The doctors here have secrets . They do things and they do n't tell you what they 're doing . I try to speak English , but I ca n't . It 's a tongue that 's so thick , it makes me choke . It makes no sense . It 's sounds like words from a children 's game to me . ( The ANGELS begin singing and playing the patty-cake game " I Have To The Teacher . " MARILUZ joins in on the twist step . Or sing a reprise of " Arroz Con Leche. " ) p. 5 ANGELS ( Singings and playing patty-cake ) " I have to the little donde empezar ( curtsy ) 2Very good , ha , empezar. 2 I have to the little donde bolero ( bolero step ) 2Very good , ha , bolero. 2 I have to the teacher donde el twist ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 2 I have to the teacher donde pachanga ( pachanga step ) 2Very good , ha , pachanga. 2 I have to the teacher donde pudn 2Very good , ha , pudn. 2 I have to the teacher donde el mashed potato ( mashed step ) 2Very good , ha , el mashed potato . 2 I have to the teacher donde se acab ( turn around ) 2Very good , ha , se acab. 2 MARILUZ There 's things I 'd like to learn how to do . Like how to read and write . People who can do that are lucky . People who can put letters together to make words and sign their names can always prove what belongs to them . That would help me fill out forms . You need to fill out forms to get better in this country . Sometimes when they have different colors on them , I can tell which one I need to bring to my case worker  --  but sometimes they do n't and another week passes by  --  or a month  --  or two months  --  or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister for at least that long . She threw me out of her house cause I got the curse and she got scared of me , Mary . She was pregnant then  --  I guess she 's a mother now . And she did n't want me near her baby . But that 's not how you catch it , by being somebody 's aunt . And when I remember my sister and the baby she wo n't ever let me see , I just want to cry . But tears do n't help anybody . Especially mine . ( Pause ; It begins to snow . ) This is the worse for me . This weather . It hurts to open my eyes  --  I 'm so cold . Does n't matter how much I put on . Does n't matter if there 's Sun between the snowflakes . Snow gets in my bones . Always has . I 'm from a warm place with mountains . This can never be that place but my body still thinks it 's gon na go home one day . ( Pause ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't take my medicine anymore . I give it to Felipe . He do n't like going in to get his own , because he says they treat him like he 's a feather-dropper . And he is n't  --  that 's what he always tells me . It was playing with women got him sick  --  not men . He 's a man who ca n't help himself around women . Anyway , the medicines wo n't help me , because I 'm cursed . So what does it matter ? ( Pause ) They 're going to put me in a good program next week , but I do n't know if Felipe will let me go . He says I should n't go all the way to Manhattan . There 's hospitals right here in the Bronx . And that 's true . Why should I make him go all the way to Manhattan ? It 's probably not even that much better . It 's too far for him to go visit me and he 's my only family now . ( Pause ) Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My caseworker , Rosa , asked me last week if I was afraid to die . And I thought , what a crazy question to ask somebody who 's dying . It 's like asking me if I 'm afraid to be Guatemalan or afraid to be dark skinned or afraid to be Mariluz . I am dying . I do n't want to die , but I 'm not scared of it . Not anymore . Not now that it 's part of my life . When I wake up , I think I 'm glad I 'm not dead , not I 'm glad I 'm still alive . When I sing a song , I think : will this be the last song I sing ? When I eat a piece of bread , I think : will this be the last thing I taste ? It 's not about being sad or sorry for myself  --  no it 's about the truth . I always asked questions about everything , since I was a little girl . Is this the last time I 'll see the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am now , I always planned to die . When I saw Felipe on my first Thanksgiving in this country , I should have asked , " is this my last Thanksgiving ? " A lot could have changed that day  --  if I had n't fallen in love . ( Pause ) Is that what you were trying to tell me that day ? p. 6 ANGELS &amp; MARILUZ ( Singing ) " Contigo si , contigo no , contigo mi vida me casame yo . " MARILUZ I forgot the stones , when I saw the sunlight on your face . There 's so much I would like to forget now . ( Pause ) Sometimes I dream about poisoning Felipe . I am always angry in my sleep . ( MARILUZ goes to FELIPE and strokes his hair gently and begins to write in a reading/writing primer as the ANGELS sing and lights slowly fade to black . ) MARILUZ ( Writing in the primer ) " A " ahpull ( apple ) . ( SHE continues to go through the alphabet softly as the ANGELS sing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
