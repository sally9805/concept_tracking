<p> It 's Saturday night and the crowd is rocking  --  clapping , stomping , cheering , whistling and singing along with the band . A woman in a black dress bumps a tambourine against her thigh . Another woman springs up and down in the aisle , swinging her hands at her side and making the print of her skirt blur as she spins . <p> This is a worship service at the 131-year-old , 600-member Second Baptist Church , but the white Baptist Hymnals stay in their racks behind the pews . <p> " Jump up and shout ! " the band sings . " I 'm on the Jesus train . " A line moves through the church , bouncing and kicking like dancers at a sock hop , picking up people as it moves . <p> As exuberance builds , there 's a sense that anything can happen . <p> Then , the mood changes . The music slows and softens . Those in need of prayer drift forward to the front of the church . Others are there to pray for them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then a man . Then another woman . <p> There 's no alarm . A gray-haired woman calmly drapes a sheet over each of them . Several minutes later , one by one , they slowly stand up and make their way back to their seats . <p> They 've done " carpet time , " as it is known on the circuit of revival services that have broken out across North America . They 've been " slain in the spirit , " or as their minister , the Rev. Gary Folds , prefers to call it , " resting in the Lord . " <p> And because of it , Second Baptist could be in violation of a proposed amendment to the constitution of the Georgia Baptist Convention . Baptists meeting in Columbus on Monday and Tuesday will consider excluding from membership any church that encourages members " to speak in tongues or to participate in the practice of ' being slain in the spirit , ' or engage in worship practices that are divisive and disruptive . " The amendment also would exclude churches condoning homosexual behavior . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Committee in September , is the product of a Membership Study Committee appointed in 1997 and headed by the Rev. Gerald Harris of Eastside Baptist Church in Marietta . <p> " I think what has happened is that there are Christians who get into churches that are sort of cold and non-feeling , and they want to see something happen , " said Harris , who is expected to be elected president of the convention at the Columbus meeting . " They begin to seek something to enliven their worship experience , and maybe they begin to delve into some of these practices . " <p> Baptist denominational structure says each church is autonomous , Harris acknowledged , " but most churches are members of associations . If our church were to begin to practice some of these things we 've had reported to us , and then our people began to have influence among their friends at other churches , it could be a disruptive sort of thing . " <p> " Baptists are noted as a people who believe in the Bible and we seek to take the position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said the Rev. Robert White , executive director of the Georgia Baptist Convention . " Our concerns relate to the more extreme charismatic behavior  --  barking like dogs , ' holy laughter , ' being slain in the spirit , these things that are really extrabiblical . " <p> Harris and White make references to Toronto and to Pensacola , Fla. , two cities where long-term revivals have gained international attention . <p> On Jan. 20 , 1994 , under guest pastor Randy Clark , about 200 worshippers at the Airport Vineyard Church in Toronto experienced a phenomenon that has come to be known as the " Toronto Blessing " that consists of uncontrollable mirth called holy laughter and of people moaning , shaking , barking like dogs , roaring like lions , jumping as if on pogo sticks and staggering " drunk in the spirit . " People also have claimed miraculous healings . Spinoff services have been held in other cities , including metro Atlanta . <p> At Brownsville Assembly of God in Pensacola , the " Pensacola Outpouring " began on Father 's Day of 1995 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car thief . It has drawn visitors from across the country . People by the dozen fall to the floor each night slain in the spirit ; others shake uncontrollably as if flooded with electric current . <p> Those revivals have been controversial , even among other Pentecostals . <p> Baptists visit such events because " they 're curious , " said White . " That curiosity can lead to interest and that interest can lead to involvement . An individual becomes involved , goes back to the local church and seeks to bring others into that experience . " ' Hungrier by the meeting ' Second Baptist 's Folds went to the Airport Vineyard Church in Toronto 4 1/2 years ago with a group that included one of his best friends . <p> At first he was astounded when people being prayed for sank to the floor as if unconscious or broke into laughter that lasted an hour or longer . But night after night he persisted . He quizzed people who had experienced the manifestations . <p> " People were having life-altering experiences , dreams and visions , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives . I was not offended by anything I saw or heard . If anything , I might have been just a little jealous that I did not feel or sense the rest that others seemed to be having . . . . I was getting hungrier by the meeting . " <p> A few weeks later , he attended another revival started by Toronto Blessing revivalist Clark in Melbourne , Fla . This time he experienced some of what he had watched before . <p> He got to know Clark , who eventually asked him to pray over some people . Person by person they dropped . On the platform as Clark prayed for the pastors , Folds found himself on the floor . <p> " It was a rest , peace and presence such as I had never known , " he says . " It was like waves of God 's love just flowed over me . " <p> Folds returned to Melbourne , taking staff members and lay leaders of Second Baptist with him . <p> The Second Baptist staff already had made plans to start a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attending church . Now , the Saturday evening services took on some of the characteristics of Toronto and Melbourne . People regularly ended up on the golden-brown carpet . Some people said they experienced physical healings , including Folds who faced surgery for two herniated discs in his neck . <p> Not everyone was impressed . As word of the Saturday night services spread , 350 members of the church left . The church took a $ 75,000 hit to its annual budget , Folds estimates . <p> " It 's been costly for us in a lot of ways , friendship , membership and finances , " he said . " God 's just let us begin to build on what we had left and keep going in the right direction . " Differing doctrinal views At the root of the controversy among Baptists are different doctrinal views of the gifts of the Holy Spirit as detailed in Scripture . Acts 2 , for instance , describes the day of Pentecost , when all Jesus ' followers who had gathered were " filled with the Holy Spirit and began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disciple Peter quoted from the Hebrew Bible 's prophet Joel , who said God promised to pour out his spirit " and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy , and your young men shall see visions , and your old men shall dream dreams . " <p> Among Baptists , " I would say most of us think those unusual gifts that you had right there at the beginning at Pentecost , such as speaking in tongues , are something different from what you 're seeing at these worship services today , " says L. Russ Bush , academic vice president of Southeastern Baptist Seminary in Wake Forest , N.C. <p> " These people were preaching these messages for the very first time . It seems there was a miracle that occurred that allowed them to be understood by people of many different languages . What 's going on today , nobody understands . . . . , " he says . " It 's the same thing for miracles of healing and other sorts of things .. . They set the pattern that the church should be interested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pray for healing , but we do n't expect to see those almost magical activities going on . " <p> Essentially , they were done to get people 's attention , he says . <p> Southern Baptists have dealt with questions of speaking in tongues and other phenomena before . In 1993 , a controversy over the question of speaking in tongues surrounded the confirmation of the Rev. Jerry Rankin as head of what is now the International Mission Board of the SBC . Board officials characterized Rankin 's experiences as " groanings beyond words " during prayer . And in 1996 , the Florida Baptist Convention " disfellowshipped " three churches because of their worship practices . <p> Timothy George , dean of Beeson divinity school at Samford University in Birmingham , estimates that 20 to 30 churches have been expelled by local Baptist associations in recent years for such practices as speaking in tongues . <p> George says he believes the Georgia convention is " responding to some specific cases " and is attempting to " quench it before it becomes more widespread . " <p> Georgia Baptist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitution passes , expulsion of any church will not be hasty . <p> The purpose of beginning discussions with a church will be " to be constructive and to restore a fellowship between the church and the convention , " says White . White emphasizes that the convention is not investigating Second Baptist or any other church . <p> And Second Baptist 's Folds says there is nothing to investigate . <p> " What we have done , I think we can justify , " he says . " I do n't think we have to build a defense to do what God 's told us to do . " <p> Folds says the Saturday night services are accomplishing their goal " to reach lost people and transform saved people . " <p> Charlotte Etheridge , 41 , says " amen . " A twice-divorced former addict who served two years in a U.S. prison on drug-related charges , Etheridge attended Second Baptist on a Saturday night 3 1/2 years ago with a friend who assured her he was not taking her to a traditional church service . <p> " Sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of my body , like the pastor ministered right to my heart , " she says . As people prayed over her and she sank to the carpet , " I felt joy for the first time in my whole life , " she says . " When I got up the next morning , it was like somebody opened my mouth and poured buckets of love in me . My body even smelled different . I could n't wait to come back and get the feeling of love again . " <p> She gave up the adulterous relationship she was having at the time and eventually reconciled with her second husband . Now he 's off drugs and attends church at Second Baptist , too . <p> Could she have made such a change in her life without the worship experience on her first night there ? <p> " If God had not touched me in that kind of manifestation , I may not have believed it was real , " she says . " With me always numbing myself out on alcohol and drugs , if I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might not have ever changed .
