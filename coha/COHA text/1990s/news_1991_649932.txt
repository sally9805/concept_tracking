<p> Let 's tug at a thread and see if it unravels a strategy . <p> The thread is a single fact , unremarked in the torrent of analysis about the first fortnight of the war : after a late-night Cabinet meeting , the Government of Turkey announced it would soon end its ban , in force since 1983 , on the speaking of the Kurdish language . <p> One person in six in Turkey is a Kurd ; that 's almost 10 million people . Ankara calls them " mountain Turks " and has long pretended that this distinct ethnic group , with a culture , language and history dating back a thousand years , was melting into the Turkish pot . <p> Not so ; the Kurds , with 10 million more living in Iraq , Iran , Syria and the Soviet Union , fiercely resist assimilation , no matter what national flags fly over what is loosely called Kurdistan . <p> This stiffneckedness , coupled with the Kurdish hope that an Iranian victory in the recent war might have led to freedom for the 3.5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genocidal campaign . <p> He razed 3,000 villages in northeastern Iraq , driving the survivors out of oil-rich lands to barren wastes in the south , or to refuge in Turkey ; after the war , in a lesson to all those who would oppose him , Saddam 's helicopters poison-gassed 5,000 defenseless men , women and children in the Kurdish town of Halabja . <p> The world turned its eyes away . The threat of more poison gas ended the resistance , but vengeance burns in the heart of every Kurdish patriot . The regime in Baghdad knows this : " If you have forgotten Halabja , " warned one of Saddam 's high command recently , " we are ready to repeat the operation . " <p> However , Jonathan Randall of The Washington Post reports from Damascus that about 2,500 Kurdish guerrillas who had escaped to Syria have infiltrated back into northeastern Iraq . Thousands more , I 'm told , are entering from three other countries . No tougher or more battle-hardened fighters exist anywhere ; they await the order to ignite an uprising . <p> Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Turgut Ozal suddenly and urgently sensitive to Kurdish ethnicity in Turkey ? <p> Because he knows that the wide array of Kurdish factions , with the exception of a nutty Marxist splinter , have come together to assert a claim to a portion of Iraq adjacent to Turkey . They speak of an autonomous region within Iraq , not full independence ; but if Kurds establish a headquarters for Kurdistan in northeastern Iraq , the Kurds in Turkey may agitate for the same autonomy . <p> The Turkish President does not want to see a Kurdish entity next-door . Part of the payment for his cooperation in making an air base available to us  --  from which to hit Iraq from the north  --  has been in assurances that we will not encourage nationalism in the Kurds . <p> We have probably given him that ; selling out the Kurds , even after Halabja , has been a specialty of the U.S. State Department . <p> But wars always lead to peace tables ; after the defeat of Saddam Hussein , the gulf deck will be shuffled , and control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> If , after another couple of months of air bombardment , a mop-up ground attack is needed ; and if the large Turkish Army joins in a second front , thereby quickly breaking Iraqi resistance  --  then Turkey will have a big say in the territorial fate of northeast Iraq . The least it could demand : dibs on its oil production as reparation ; the most : a redrawing of boundaries . <p> On the other hand , if Turkey stands relatively aloof in the war 's final stage , failing to apply the crusher ; and if Kurdish guerrillas valiantly take on Saddam Hussein 's garrisons and sabotage his war effort on the ground  --  then the Kurds will come away from their long agony having earned a homeland . <p> President Ozal sees this ; that would explain the urgency of his embrace of Kurdish ethnic identity . He sees , too , the need to make Muslim , Westernized Turkey the strategic bridge between the West and Middle East , helping it gain entry into the European markets even as NATO atrophies ; that would explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Baghdad . <p> Lest learned geopoliticians pooh-pooh this reading , consider the opinion of the enemy as expressed in the present order of battle . Saddam Hussein , who needs every man in Kuwait to face the Americans , now has 120,000 men on line up north to face the Turks . <p> I say to urge the Turks to hit them in the front , urge and equip the Kurds to harass them in the back , and sort out rewards and retribution at the peace table .
