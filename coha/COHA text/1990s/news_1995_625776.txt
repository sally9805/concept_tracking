<p> IRVING - Troy Aikman talked earnestly about redemption . <p> Michael Irvin spoke of how much fun it would be to set an NFL record with the greatest receiver of all time relegated to the role of jealous observer . Deion Sanders even went so far as to say that his old teammates were " " in denial . " <p> And why not ? This was the second week in November , and the Dallas Cowboys were on top of the world . They were 8-1 , tied for the best record in the NFL . They had just added Sanders to a team many already had conceded a spot to in the Super Bowl . <p> Best of all , their old buddies , the San Francisco 49ers , were stumbling into Texas Stadium with a 5-4 record , ready to be pushed off the nearest cliff . <p> Life was good . <p> Just one more little shove , and . . . <p> " " Man , that seems like a long time ago , " guard Nate Newton was saying at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " " This has been a long season . A real long season . " <p> Certainly , it has been a long month . And now , with that once-promising season rapidly slipping away , Barry Switzer finds himself talking in terms he could not have imagined a little more than 30 days ago . <p> Circle the wagons . Us against the world . Win these last two games , make the playoffs , get to the championship game , and maybe . . . <p> Maybe ? <p> What happened ? <p> Some blame it on Switzer , whose abilities to coach on the NFL level have never been more in question after Sunday 's ill-fated fourth-down gamble in Philadelphia . Others cite injuries , depleted talent , limited depth . <p> Still others say that five months of Super Bowl talk , with a grandstanding owner leading the chorus , may have taken a toll on a team for which only one outcome can truly satisfy . <p> And yes , there even has been a hint or two that the nucleus of a two-time champion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now - may simply have grown too wealthy , self-satisfied and indifferent to reach the top again . <p> All of those may be factors , but one stands out . <p> What happened to the Cowboys ? <p> The 49ers . <p> Again . <p> " " When a team beats you that bad . . . yeah , you think about it for a while , " safety Bill Bates said . " " It makes you think about what you 're doing , that 's for sure . " <p> San Francisco 38 , Dallas 20 would do that all of that , exposing the weaknesses and pricking at the psyche of a team for which beating the Niners had been the obsession that drove a summer and fall of refocused efforts . <p> This was supposed to be the Cowboys ' moment of vindication , and suddenly , they were confronted with very different images : The inestimable Elvis Grbac , sitting in for starter Steve Young , throwing for more than 300 yards . Jerry Rice getting 80 of those on the game 's second play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 49ers ' defense - minus Sanders - containing Smith , smothering Irvin and throttling the Dallas attack . <p> Worse yet , those first few minutes looked so eerily familiar : More Dallas turnovers helped build a 17-0 deficit , just as three quick mistakes had put the Cowboys in a 21-0 hole in the NFC Championship Game back in January . <p> But if this one looked the same , it felt different . <p> No one was calling it a fluke . <p> " " We got our butts kicked , " Sanders said Wednesday . <p> And this time , there would be an undercurrent of questions about Aikman , who left the game early with a bruised knee and was gone from the locker room before halftime . There would be criticism of Irvin , who talked big and played small ( four catches , 37 yards , one fumble returned for a Niner touchdowns ) , and doubts expressed about the coaching staff 's use of Sanders , who was no factor at all as the Niners cleverly moved Rice around , keeping him away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think that whole game was a shock to everybody , " safety Scott Case says now . " " No one expected that . " <p> In hindsight , perhaps they should have . <p> The 49ers merely exploited liabilities already in place . <p> With the streaky but dangerous Alvin Harper gone to Tampa Bay , Dallas had failed to find an adequate replacement , increasing the burden on Irvin . When San Francisco was able to contain Smith with its seven-man front , it enabled the Niners to double-cover Irvin and still get help on tight end Jay Novacek , effectively taking both out of the game . <p> Defensively , Dallas may have had its " " difference-maker " on the field in the form of Sanders , but the Cowboys clearly had n't figured out what to do with him . When Rice went into the slot , Sanders ended up covering John Taylor or J.J. Stokes for most of the day . <p> For Dallas , then , this was n't just a disappointing loss . <p> " " Everything we 'd done was geared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " When we lost , it was like it all went out the window . " <p> Nothing has been quite the same since . Wins over Oakland and Kansas City - AFC powers , but each with flaws of its own - gave the illusion that Dallas had righted itself , but subsequent losses to the Redskins and Eagles have resurrected doubts . <p> Now , a team that boasted of its strengths is left to ponder its weaknesses and contemplate its own mortality as the season enters its final weeks . <p> Injuries have rendered the defense average at best . The loss of cornerback Kevin Smith , who ruptured an Achilles ' tendon in the season 's first game , made the addition of Sanders more a necessity than a luxury . Before midseason , Charles Haley , the pass rusher credited with elevating the defense to Super Bowl caliber , would fade as his aching back began to limit his effectiveness . <p> The offensive line , annually one of the NFL 's best , has taken some hits , too . Tackle Erik Williams - an All-Pro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is only a shell of his former self . Center Ray Donaldson - a capable fill-in for free-agent departee Mark Stepnoski - went down with a broken leg , leaving the job to an overweight , out-of-shape Derek Kennard . <p> In the midst of it all , Aikman , feeling the effects of calf and knee injuries , has put together two of his worst back-to-back performances since 1990 , his second year in the league . Emmitt Smith , once on pace for a 2,000-yard season , sprained a knee ligament on Thanksgiving Day and has been prone to uncharacteristic fumbles at critical times . <p> All of a sudden , no one is talking about Dallas being the NFL 's most talented team anymore . <p> " " You know , there really is n't much difference in teams , " Switzer said earlier this week . " " When you get away from quarterback and running back , we 're just about all the same . <p> " " It gets down to who plays . If you do n't play well , it 's all equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the running back has played well , but those two have had plenty of company on a team that has lost three of its last five games , dropping to 10-4 overall and relinquishing the inside track for home-field playoff advantage in the NFC . <p> The 49ers raised another round of questions . <p> " " Right now , " Nate Newton said , " " it 's up to us to find some answers . " <p> Is Deion really worth it ? <p> Jerry Jones viewed the courtship of Deion Sanders as a sign of his commitment to make the Cowboys the NFL 's most loaded team . <p> Others saw it as a message that Jones believed the Cowboys , without Sanders , were not good enough to win another Super Bowl . <p> In light of Kevin Smith 's injury , the need for Sanders is beyond dispute . Since making his Dallas debut on Oct. 29 , however , the $ 35 million man has been high-price , low-impact , producing two interceptions and catching just two passes for 25 yards . <p> Not all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teams generally stay away from him on the corner , virtually conceding his side of the field . Hamstring and groin injuries , meanwhile , have limited his time on offense and special teams . <p> Sanders ' Wednesday outburst against media critics of the team and of Switzer may have been a play for credibility in the locker room . Either way , Sanders is under the microscope , and the coming weeks will go a long way toward determining how this deal ultimately is viewed . <p> Where 's Alvin ? <p> After losing Alvin Harper , the Dallas coaching staff convinced itself it had a suitable replacement on hand in either Corey Fleming or Kevin Williams . <p> Neither has panned out , and Switzer does n't sound surprised . <p> " " I never felt Corey had the physical talent to be a great receiver , " he says now . " " He 's not a 4.3 guy . His upside potential has never been there because he 's limited physically . <p> " " We had him because he was available . We needed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a difference-maker . " <p> Six catches for 83 yards and a handful of drops support Switzer 's assessment . But what about the more-experienced Williams , the third receiver a year ago ? So far , the third-year player has contributed only 24 catches for 325 yards and no touchdowns . <p> " " Kevin 's a nickel guy , " Switzer said . " " That 's where his expertise is . " <p> Some have suggested going after a veteran free agent - former Oiler Ernest Givins , perhaps ? - but the ongoing dispute over the salary-cap charge of Sanders ' contract has pretty much frozen the current roster . <p> Is there life ( or at least a pass rush ) after Haley ? <p> Off to one of the best starts of his NFL career , Charles Haley had 10.5 sacks in the season 's first 10 games . As his back deteriorated , eventually requiring surgery last week , Haley 's effectiveness did , too . <p> " " Charles is a difference-maker , " Switzer said . " " You do n't just replace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with three sacks Sunday against the Eagles , the Cowboys had managed just two in the previous three games . <p> Part of the success against Philadelphia was a product of mixing in some blitzes , something Dallas did n't have to do before Haley 's bulging disk left the pass rush flat on its back . <p> What 's the matter with Emmitt ? <p> Just last year , Emmitt Smith did n't lose a fumble in 418 touches of the ball . The year before , he turned it over just once . From 1991 to ' 94 , in fact , Smith lost just seven fumbles . <p> This season , he already has lost six . <p> The most recent of those may have cost the Cowboys Sunday 's game , long before Switzer 's fourth-and-one gamble . With Dallas up by three , Smith was stripped inside the Eagles ' five-yard line , denying Dallas points that might have put the game away . <p> " " What it looks like to me is that we 're carrying the ball a little differently , a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " We 've got to get it up more in the rib-cage area , and that 's what we 're going to do . <p> " " Emmitt Smith is not a fumbler . " <p> Without a quick-strike threat at receiver , the Cowboys can not afford him to be . The Dallas offense is predicated on controlling the ball and minimizing mistakes . When the Cowboys lose the turnover game , they generally lose on the scoreboard , too . <p> Sunday , after the fumble and the fourth-down failure , the normally affable Smith was so upset he could barely speak . <p> " " I put a lot of pressure on him , there 's no question , " Switzer said . " " Emmitt is one of the great players in the game . Because we had him , that 's one reason we made the decision to go for that . " <p> Brodsky believes Smith is feeling the heat to carry an offense suddenly gone flat . <p> " " I think he 's pressing a little bit to be a better player @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Whatever some people might think , he 's a very unselfish team guy who wants to win at all cost . " <p> Ca n't we have a little fun around here ? <p> Troy Aikman has described this as a " " joyless " season . ( He said that last year , too , by the way . ) Other players have talked about finding ways to have fun in the face of great expectations and questionable returns . <p> After doling out about $ 40 million in bonuses this year alone , Jerry Jones finds such whining a bit hard to swallow . <p> " " If you compare that to the careers that other people have , what people do in law , medicine , business . . . maybe we 're having a little more fun than it looks like we 're having , " he said . <p> Increasingly , however , players complain about being measured by too high a standard . Every game is accompanied by a full report card in each of the area 's major papers , and lately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Even when we go out there and win a game , we pick up the paper and see where we all got F 's , " Emmitt Smith said . <p> Why worry about such things ? <p> " " Hey , we 're human , " Smith said . " " We can read the paper , too . " <p> The fans are no less discerning . After back-to-back success in 1992 and ' 93 , the Cowboys ' NFC Championship Game loss to San Francisco back in January generally was dismissed as a turnover-filled aberration . A return to form in 1995 not only was anticipated , it was demanded . <p> " " We 're expected to win . When we do n't , we 're hammered , " Brodsky said . " " Human nature is that you ca n't continue being hammered all the time . <p> " " They ca n't handle the media pressure . It grinds you down . " <p> The product of that grind was never more evident than in Philadelphia , an ugly game that ended on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Erik Williams after being sacked on the final play by a three-man rush . <p> Does frustration at some point turn to dissension ? <p> " " This team is too close to have that kind of problem , like finger-pointing , " tackle Mark Tuinei says . " " We 're too tight for that to happen . " <p> In an effort to ensure it does n't , Switzer rolled out the heavy artillery at Monday 's first team meeting following the Philadelphia debacle . The 57-year-old coach talked about his own life , of an unfaithful father killed by a jealous mistress and a mother who ultimately committed suicide . <p> " " We have two options , " he said . " " We can moan and point fingers at each other . But if we play like a team , it 'll answer everything . " <p> Is life with Jerry wearing thin ? <p> Jerry Jones ' falling-out with Jimmy Johnson ultimately hinged on Johnson 's unwillingness to operate on a short leash . Since Johnson 's departure , Jones has taken an increasingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was the preseason deal with Pepsi , the first volley in his war against NFL Properties . There was his bold sideline appearance with Nike CEO Phil Knight on the season 's opening Monday night , a garish bit of showmanship that drew the ire of old-line owners . <p> American Express joined the fun soon enough . And Jones ' relentless pursuit of Sanders kept the owner in the news for weeks . <p> " " There 's never a dull moment around here , that 's for sure , " said Case , the longtime Atlanta Falcon in his first year with the Cowboys . <p> Not everyone is so good-humored about life under the big top . <p> Aikman , for one , has privately complained that the Cowboys are perceived around the league as a " " no-class " organization . And Jones ' constant squabbles with the league have only intensified the heat on a club that is already the most visible in all of sports . <p> The owner 's comment that , barring injuries , anything short of a Super Bowl is " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the locker room , either . <p> " " This has been a long year because expectations are so high , " Tuinei said . " " Everyone is talking about going to the Super Bowl when we need to be focused on winning our division . <p> " " There 's so much outside pressure to do a little bit more , be a little bit better . <p> " " Nothing is ever good enough . " <p> Can Barry stay the course ? <p> Sunday 's loss , and the storm that followed , led some to question whether the Cowboys believe in their coach . <p> People generally like Barry Switzer . But do they respect him ? <p> " " I ca n't answer that , " Switzer said . " " I 've had players come to <p> me . They supported me in that decision . They told me it was the right call . " <p> Either way , the debate over Switzer has dominated the week , obscuring the shortcomings of well-paid , experienced players who have not been performing up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Barry , " said Brodsky . " " That 's why he 's the head coach . <p> " " We can blame it on Barry because it 's the easy thing to do . " <p> Indeed , Switzer has faced the crisis and shouldered the blame . But can he find a way to energize a team that has appeared indifferent at best in recent weeks ? <p> For the first time in his two-year Dallas career , Switzer 's style may be more important than his substance . <p> " " He 's not a rip-your-heart-out guy , " said Brodsky . " " He tries to lift you up and bring you along and allow you to coach and hope you know what you 're doing . In most cases , he 's correct . <p> " " He 's circling the wagons now . We 're now Custer , and we 're about to get overrun here . <p> " " If we 're not real , real careful , there wo n't be a person left without an arrow through his heart . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have an incredible opportunity here , we really do , " Switzer said the other day . " " If you want to believe what 's said in the paper and on TV and radio , these guys ca n't get it done , these coaches ca n't get it done . <p> " " It gives us a chance to make some history . That 's the approach I take , and that 's the approach the coaches and players take . " That history may have to be made in San Francisco now . If each team finishes 12-4 , the 49ers claim the home-field edge by virtue of the first tiebreaker , head-to-head competition . <p> " " As long as we get an opportunity to play in the championship game , we do n't care where it might be , " Switzer said . " " If it happens to be in Dallas , San Francisco , the desert , a cow pasture , whatever . It 's how we arrive there that matters . " <p> Winning the NFC East is the first step , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday at Texas Stadium ) and at Arizona ( Christmas Night ) to secure the division title and a first-round playoff bye . If there is a clear sign of the current decline it is that a 5-9 New York team whose season opened with a 35-0 loss to Dallas suddenly becomes a litmus test . <p> " " The toughest things to get over are the things that come with losing , " Switzer said . " " You start second-guessing . You question the offensive coordinator , the play-calling . <p> " " But a player ca n't let the radio or the press influence how you prepare for the next ballgame . You ca n't wallow in that other stuff . " <p> Since Nov. 12 , Switzer has struggled to pull his team out of that mire . <p> The 49ers had done it again . <p> Was this the killing blow ? <p> " " Nothing is going to be right , " safety Darren Woodson says , " " until we play them again . "
