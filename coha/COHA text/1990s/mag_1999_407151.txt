In New Mexico , where I live , solar energy is an abundant resource , but it 's not the only one . It can be more economical to build a hybrid system , combining resources to charge a single battery bank . Wind power is a natural complement to solar : when the sun does n't shine , the cooler temperatures help to create a breeze that can be put to work turning a wind turbine . You 're probably aware of the huge wind farms that provide supplemental power to Los Angeles and power entire cities in other countries . I 'm excited about the potential for large-scale wind power plants for cities , and in my community I have already begun to see the potential of wind power for the smallsystem do-it-yourselfer . After apprenticing as an electrician and studying at the Carbondale , Colorado-based Solar Energy International-a nonprofit organization that provides renewable energies education and technical assistance-I started Amazon Power in 1993 and began installing solar in the area . As my clients took an interest in wind , I began installing wind generators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most sensible way to boost the capacity of an existing photovoltaic ( PV ) system . A strong wind resource can allow you to have a smaller battery bank for storage . If you 're interested in exploring the possibility of adding a small wind turbine to your system , read on for some tips I 've gained from working with small units manufactured to provide power to independent homes , small school and clinics , as well as for pumping Water . Evaluating Wind Potential First , assess your location for its wind power potential . You can purchase metering devices and obtain average wind speed data from the airport closest to your home . This information is normally collected at 30 feet above ground level , which is about the minimum height to set a wind generator , as wind speeds are somewhat slower and are subject to more obstructions closer to the ground . Inversely , the higher above the ground , the more significant the wind speed . For a small supplemental generator that can cost as little as $1,000 , including the tower and installation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficient . Raise a light flag , and make it a habit to observe trees and shrubbery around your site . If they are perpetually bent , it 's a good indication of a persistent wind . At 4 to 7 mph , you can feel the wind on your face and leaves will rustle . At 8 to 12 mph , leaves will be in constant motion and the flag will raise in the wind . Wind speeds of 13 to 18 mph raise dust and move small branches , and at 19 to 24 mph , trees in leaf begin to sway . At 25 mph , large branches begin to move , and you 've got great wind-generating potential ! Small generators can be mounted on a pole with guy wires . ( I do n't recommend mounting a wind generator on your roof , regardless of what some manufacturers might suggest . Even with a small generator , noise from vibration is a problem . ) Put the generator on a tilt-up pole tower to make it easier to install and maintain . This allows you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before raising the tower-no climbing needed ! Keep voltage loss down to 2% by using large enough wire . Manufacturers will provide charts to help determine the proper wire size for your installation . // <p>
