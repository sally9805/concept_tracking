<p> Did Cobb County need a self-inflicted black eye ? Does it have any business meddling in a matter in which it has no jurisdiction ? The answers to those questions are " no " and " no . " Unfortunately , a majority of the Cobb County Commission seems to think otherwise . <p> The commission has foolishly embarked on an inexplicable crusade , touting family values and bashing homosexuals . Commissioner Gordon Wysong of East Cobb was first out of the gate , pledging to cut county funding to Theatre in the Square because it presented two plays that touched on gay themes . . . . <p> . . . The national media , not surprisingly , pounced on the move and have depicted Cobb County in less-than-flattering terms . In fact , it likely would take millions of dollars worth of advertising to reverse the negative impression the country has gotten of Cobb in the past week or so . <p> . . . Gays have rights in Cobb , just as they have anywhere else in the country . There is no need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , advocating - any particular lifestyle . . . . <p> That said , it should be added that Wysong is not completely off- base . His proposal to strip Theatre in the Square of its share of county funding has merit , as far as it goes . It just does n't go far enough . <p> Government has no business funding the arts . . . The present set-up leaves artists at the mercy of politicians . . . . Cutting such funding will give artists the freedom to produce any art they want without Big Brother looking over their shoulders . . . . <p> THE AUGUSTA CHRONICLE Cobb draws a line <p> The section of the Cobb resolution which has the Politically Correct crowd up in arms reads , " Lifestyles advocated by the gay community should not be endorsed by government policy-makers , because they are incompatible with the standards to which this community subscribes ; and that gay lifestyle units are directly contrary to state law . " <p> Now what 's wrong with that ? If the resolution praised the homosexuals and proclaimed " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would come from those whose opinions do n't ( or should n't ) count as far as elitist opinion-makers are concerned . <p> . . . It is not homosexuals as human beings that are drawing the fire , it 's their behavior . It may come as a surprise to the storm troopers of Political Correctness , but Americans have as much right to oppose their agenda as they have to advance it . <p> Three cheers for the Cobb Commission . <p> JEFF WHITFIELD A dose of common sense <p> . . . Frankly , I 'm shocked a group of politicians had the guts , nerve and fortitude to actually do something like this . . . . The liberal elements in the national media will make fire-snorting , hatemongering queer-bashers out of the commissioners . But these elected officials know the risks of their decisions and besides , nobody but Cobb Countians vote for them , so national opinion can take a hike . <p> . . . Maybe this will open a veritable floodgate of common-sense talk from elected officials . If a certain crowd of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onstage while dousing herself with chocolate syrup , let them buy an unsubsidized ticket and we 'll see if such " art " could stand on its own " merits . " <p> Of course , the cry from civil libertarians is " censorship . " So ? I live in Henry County and if my tax money . . . should ever be spent on something I find objectionable , you better believe I am going to oppose it . The First Amendment guarantees the right of anybody to say anything , but I believe it also guarantees the right for a community 's majority to say , " We do n't want that here . " <p> Jeff Whitfield is news editor of the Clayton News/Daily . This column was published on Aug. 11 . <p> Cobb 's theocracy <p> What in heaven 's name is going on in Cobb County ? First , it was the debacle over the Ten Commandments plaque in the state court building ; now , it 's legislative gay-bashing . <p> It seems as though we have elected not commissioners but ministers - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones at that . <p> It 's time we came to our senses and reminded these self-appointed guardians of morality that there is such a principle as the separation of church and state . If they ca n't live with that , perhaps we should send these commissioners on a one-way trip to Iran , where they 'll find a government more suited to their theocratic temperaments . <p> Short of that , and less expensive , we can send a clear message on Election Day that wo n't be very popular with the incumbents . <p> An American lifestyle <p> I praise the commissioners of Cobb County for the anti-gay ordinance . This country was founded on the family . We have diversity , but we can only respect the American family lifestyle . <p> C.E. JOHNSON , Kennesaw <p> Cooper does right <p> Three cheers to Bill Cooper for opposing the Cobb County family- values resolution . I commend his courage and conviction . Perhaps one day we will insist that our commissioners have qualities of compassion and intelligence . If that day comes , I will be pleased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crop of reactionary commissioners . <p> KATHRYN TUCKER , Kennesaw <p> Community of one <p> I am delighted with the action of the Cobb County commissioners . However , I do question their commitment to community standards . The proposal does n't go far enough . Jews should be included , as they do not accept Christian family values . Besides , my grandfather told me they want all the money . The Irish are a threat - they drink too much . And the Greeks - the men dance together ! Really ! <p> My mother told me that all Italians are gangsters . Put them in jail and make Cobb County safe again . While we 're at it , let 's condemn liberals . They just want to give everything away . We should close Japanese businesses since they want to take over America . Would n't Cobb County be a wonderful place to live if there were only a few of us bigots left ? We could form a club and call it the Big Chicken . <p> GARY E. MULLINS , Smyrna <p> In search of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ censorship , but a notion that freedom of expression is necessary for great art is not one of them . <p> The Czarist empire , one of the most repressive regimes that ever existed , gave us " War and Peace " and " The Cherry Orchard . " The ' 60s in America gave us " Hair , " about which the kindest thing to say is it was a period piece , and was even then . <p> Even the Nazis had their moments . " Carmina Burana " may or may not be a masterpiece , but it is a pillar of the choral repertory . The composer , Karl Orff , was not exactly a leader of the resistance . <p> Simply put : Artistic freedom is one thing , art quite another . <p> TURNER CASSITY , Decatur <p> What ' censorship ' ? <p> When state representatives take a stand for morality by saying that books that endorse homosexuality and lesbianism have no place in the children 's section of the public library , we hear the cry of censorship . <p> When Cobb County @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for arts groups ' receiving county subsidies , again we hear " censorship . " <p> One recent letter writer spoke of the need to open people 's minds , expand their views and broaden their beliefs . <p> What I 'd like to know is , where were all these open-minded people when the Bible was banned from public-school classrooms ? <p> CLAIRE J.
