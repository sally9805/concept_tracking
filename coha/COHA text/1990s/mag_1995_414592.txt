Successful moral leadership for the twenty-first century will be grounded in centuries-old concepts of ethics that may never change . Yet it will also be flexible , adaptable , and inventive . Why ? Because the moral landscape of the next century will be shaped by three conditions our ancestors could not have imagined . First , we will face entirely new ethical issues . Second , we will live in an age of increasing moral intensity . Third , we will experience unprecedented pressures to drop out of society and make a separate peace  --  to carve out moral enclaves disconnected from the ethical issues of the world . NEW ETHICAL ISSUES On the evening of November 2 , 1988 , a 23-year-old graduate student , Robert Tappan Morris , sat down at his computer terminal at Cornell University and committed what some pundits have called the crime of the century . Finding a security flaw in the computer programs of the Defense Department 's Advanced Research Projects Agency network , he launched a " worm " program into a computer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing like a tapeworm through the 60,000 computers of the system until it soaked up so much of their memory that they began to crash . In the end , Morris did something no one else had yet done : He broke into and paralyzed a major computer network . Morris had no criminal record , no motive for revenge , no scheme for economic gain  --  and no discernible moral restraints . " It was a mistake , and I am sorry for it , " he told the court . His father , one of the nation 's leading computer-security experts , called it " the work of a bored graduate student . " Time magazine called it " one of the most sophisticated and infectious computer viruses the world has yet seen . " U.S. District Court Judge Howard Munson , in the nation 's first prosecution under the federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 , handed Morris a light sentence that included community service and a $10,000 fine . Was Morris an oddity , a unique exception , a whacko in an otherwise normal world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology , like all frontiers , has among its citizens a distinct breed of intellectual gamblers , gunslingers , and grubstakers . For them , the moral issues pale to insignificance before the lure of discovery . In the computer world , they 're known as hackers . The fact that something can be done is , for many of them , reason enough to try it . Yet the fact that no one has ever done it before  --  nor thought hard about the ethical consequences involved  --  places a peculiar responsibility upon these discoverers . Some pause to assess the moral landscape before proceeding . Others simply gallop ahead . A society that develops ideas at only moderate rates can perhaps afford to let its ethics catch up with its inventions . But in the twentieth century , the pace of change has accelerated exponentially . As a result , the sheer growth of inventiveness has created ethical questions that simply did not arise in the past . Already , entirely new dilemmas face us at every turn : * Should unmarried teenage girls use the pill ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came on the market . * How should software be protected from unlicensed copying ? Only people living in a computer age would want to know . * Should we ban dashboard radar detectors , whose sole purpose is to help people disobey traffic laws ? The issue did n't arise until high-speed interstate highways and low-cost transistor technology joined hands in the 1980s. * Should we protect the much-diminished sea-urchin population along America 's Atlantic coast ? No one would have thought so before there were regular overnight flights to Japan , where live urchin is an expensive delicacy . * Should New England ship its nuclear waste to Texas ? Had you asked anyone 50 years ago , you would have been dismissed as a science-fiction freak : No one had ever thought of the problem . * Should fifth-graders get free condoms ? Before AIDS , the question would have seemed prurient and scandalous . * Should you and I clone ourselves ? The question has yet to come up  --  but it will . What will this pace of change mean for the twenty-first century ? Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Theodore J. Gordon and The Futures Group suggest that everything about computers  --  their size , speed , weight , and cost  --  will improve by a factor of 10,000 over the next two decades . When computers are as ubiquitous as the electric motors that run our hair dryers , clocks , and toys  --  and about as cheap and easy to replace  --  they will have a profound impact on the way we live . But if Robert Morris 's worm is any indication , they will also open vistas of ethical complexity we ca n't even imagine . INCREASING MORAL INTENSITY When Michigan pathologist Jack Kevorkian helped Janet Adkins end her life in 1990 by using his " suicide machine , " he was doing nothing new . Socrates was assisted in his suicide by those who gave him hemlock to drink . What makes Kevorkian 's work different ( besides his Mercitron machine ) is the demographics of aging . The fastest-growing cohort of the American population is the over 85 crowd . Similar increases in longevity are occurring worldwide . While many older people are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer in poorer health . Facing the prospect of life maintained only by biological interventions , sometimes in great pain and often feeling hopeless and alone , more and more of them may express a wish to die . The ethical issues surrounding euthanasia  --  " an easy death , " as my dictionary defines it  --  have been well explored by others . The point here is simply to note that the intervention and use of illegal machinery for euthanasia  --  and the publicity surrounding it  --  crank up the intensity of this issue in ways that the physicians of our grandparents ' generation never had to face . Now and then , perhaps , they encountered an elderly patient who asked them about suicide . These days , with a drumbeat of news stories about a growing list of customers for Kevorkian 's grim machinery , new questions arise about old laws governing euthanasia . Maybe , the public is asking , such machinery is not only relevant : Maybe it should be legal . As once-esoteric concerns over euthanasia are lifted from their academic context and plopped down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scores of other ethical issues pressing in upon us for attention . Reason : the extended reach of the global news media . There is nothing new in the subjects the media cover . There have always been wars , famines , plagues , and disasters , and they have always had grisly effects on populations . But only now can we see them played out in our living rooms every night . Problems that once did not trouble us  --  since we did n't know about them  --  now wring us with moral anguish and outrage . Fifty years ago we would not have cared about civil war and starvation in Somalia  --  because we would have been ignorant of it . Now , having seen it , we can not live with ourselves if we do n't take action . Multiply that single case by dozens of others , factor in all the direct-mail appeals for help from worthy causes , add up all the genuinely new ethical issues now facing us , and it 's little wonder we live in such an age of moral intensity . Among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this intensity . It 's called compassion fatigue . Faced with so many requests from so many worthy organizations engaged in such profoundly moral battles , our ability to care risks being numbed . Rather than be overwhelmed , we tune out . Earlier ages may have had an easier time of it : They merely had to support good causes . Our task is harder , observes Peter Goldmark , president of the Rockefeller Foundation . It 's no longer enough , he says , to fund causes that are merely worthwhile . Our job is to back causes that are essential . SEEKING A SEPARATE PEACE The danger , of course , is that , unless we find mental and emotional structures for addressing these causes , we may well become ethical tortoises , retreating into our shells rather than facing a world of such moral intensity . Or we may simply try to respond to ethical overload by longing for its opposite : a simpler , easier world where moral issues exist in an ordered framework . We are now seeing a return to more traditional ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be separate from the unfulfilling materialism of modern life . Put those two powerful impulses together with a charismatic leader , and the results can be ghastly . That was the story when , on April 19 , 1993 , David Koresh and his followers touched off their fatal conflagration at his Branch Davidian compound in Waco , Texas . Separatism does n't always end in flames as it did in Waco , but the incident points up three ethical issues that will increasingly tear at the fabric of civil society as the twenty-first century unfolds : * Religion . David Koresh clearly established a cult . His followers seemed absolutely dependent upon his personality and unwilling to think for themselves . But the pejorative term cult probably got in the federal agents ' way , allowing them to brand him a kook and misapprehend his weird but formidable notions . The feds , for instance , say they never suspected Koresh would torch himself . They should have . Koresh showed repeated fascination with fire imagery in the Scriptures . His biblicalism , however strange , was serious . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with stereotypes and seek to understand diversity from the inside out  --  no matter how bizarre , anti-social , or flatly illegal it may be . Insofar as the future is a place of increasing separatism , the need for this understanding will commensurably increase . * Terrorism . The federal agents also wrongly identified the Branch Davidians as terrorists . That 's not surprising : On February 26 , two days before the shootout with the feds , international terrorists blew up the garage at the World Trade Center in New York . Like terrorists , the people in Waco seemed to be anarchists taking the law into their own hands , demanding publicity and willing to use violence . But terrorists commit suicide only as a last extremity . Religious separatists , by contrast , often seek out martyrdom . Under the separatist thrust , terrorism and religious fanaticism may fuse and blur . What we need is a moral construct in which we are willing to care enough about motives to analyze them carefully and take appropriate action . * The role of the civil society . Ultimately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond law enforcement . The real purpose of the community is to make itself so fair , caring , and tolerant that a Koresh can attract few followers . People who are frightened and uneasy , longing for a higher vision , must be able to find meaning in their lives without falling prey to a quasi-religious mesmerism . As the next century progresses , the pressures on less-stable individuals may well intensify . Yearning for a separate peace , they may be especially prime targets for cultish behavior . Legislation can help by making weaponry less accessible and violence less permissible . In the end , however , only a well-balanced civil society can promote a healthy vision of a moral universe . Only a society of ethical thinkers will create a community where the lonely and unsure need not be tempted by an enclave mentality . Only a truly moral community can counter separatism wherever it shows up  --  whether as ethnic cleansing and hatred of refugees on the international front , or as special-interest pleading and a whining me-firstism on the domestic scene . RESOLVING THE DILEMMAS : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new inventions , higher intensity , and greater separatism  --  are already shaping the ethical landscape . Neither fuzzy relativism nor dogged absolutism has proved capable of addressing them . Nor , for that matter , has any compromise between those two poles . The ethics that will shape our future is not to be found on some sliding scale . The most practical ethics for the twenty-first century will have little to do with the political tugs-of-war and academic tiffs over absolutism , liberalism , family values , outcomes-based education , and the dozens of other hot-button words surrounding the ethics debate . Ethics is not simply a set of politically correct views on specific issues , or a particular moralistic stand , or a bully flag planted in the sand . It 's a way of looking at the world . It 's a process that helps us come to terms with our toughest dilemmas . It 's not a compromise ; it 's a lens . In the end , our ethics defines the way we participate in the community around us . Yet it 's also a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each of us . It calls upon us to be impartial . Yet it demands that we be engaged  --  that we have , in other words , a point of view . That may be dangerous : In a society schooled on quick fixes and educated by sitcoms that solve everything in half an hour , there is an undeniable temptation to find a formula and live by it . Too often , however , these Johnny-one-notes of the values chorus miss the point . Clinging to one value to the exclusion of others , and failing to assess the complexity of the issues surrounding them , they substitute thoughtless moralizing for moral thinking . And for that there is no longer any room . More than ever before , our age is making short shrift of those who preach without acts , indulge self-righteousness without humility , and chastise others ' wrongs without understanding their own . A morality of repetition  --  mouthing unexamined values inherited from a ghostly past  --  is rapidly giving way to something new . What 's coming ? That will depend in large part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's coming , unfortunately , may be a resurgent morality of relativism , in which core values fall into cynical disrepute and cold-blooded self-will finally drives out all vestiges of honesty , love , fairness , and respect . On the other hand , what 's coming may be a new morality of mindfulness , in which the light of ethical reason and intuition dispels shadows , builds firm conclusions , and leads to goodness , worth , and dignity . We will not survive the morality of repetition : The twenty-first century 's choices are simply too tough . Nor will we survive the morality of relativism : There is too much leverage these days behind even a single unpunished act of evil . We 'll survive by a morality of mindfulness . We 'll survive where reason moderates the clash of values and intuition schools our decision making . There 's no better way for good people to make tough choices . About the Author Rushworth M.
