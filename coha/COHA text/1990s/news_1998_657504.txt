<p> They are the top of the top 1 percent in law school . Ivy Leaguers , more often than not . Best grades . Best recommendations . Top guns of the emerging generation of legal minds . Constitutional Wunder-kinder , cocky and sure . But as these 36 men and women begin their careers as US Supreme Court law clerks in the coming weeks , they face a task tougher than any they have seen . Clerking for a Supreme Court justice - the ripest plum for a law grad - is the legal equivalent of Marine basic training at Camp Lejeune . During 80-hour work weeks , the clerks soon find out what they are made of , legally speaking . They will screen 7,500 petitions , compose 30-page memos on cases , write first drafts of rulings , advise the justices , and act as ambassadors among nine chambers that are often compared to nine different nation-states - all inside a hermetically sealed federal building where the work is shrouded in secrecy . It 's a load that prompts some court observers to ask : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who have survived their clerkships feel the responsibility - keenly . " Nothing prepares you for the first time you are presented with a case , and you realize it is just you , " says Evan Caminker , who clerked for the late Justice William Brennan . " The justices are on vacation . You do n't know anyone . You think you are going to be the first clerk who ca n't handle the job , or cracks , or gets fired . " Pound for pound , the 36 legal eagles , some of whom may never have held a job , arguably have more power than a senior congressional staffer . Congress creates legislation , but the court can determine how and whether a law may be enacted . While the nine justices are the ones who make the decisions , the reasoning and wording of the opinions - pored over for years to come by lawyers and judges - often are shaped by clerks . So it would be these clerks - three or four to a justice - who plumb the Constitution and US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for example , or whether citizens have a " right to die " or women may have a legal abortion . Moreover , clerks receive all last-resort appeals from death row inmates . How is a Supreme Court clerk chosen ? What do they do ? What influence do they have ? The answers are partly veiled . Chief Justice William Rehnquist tells the clerks in an orientation , if they did n't already know , contact with reporters is verboten . A reporter walking to the court on a bitter cold day once fell in step with a young clerk . They talked animatedly - until the reporter said who he was . With a brief apology , the clerk walked to the other side of the street . Former clerks , however , shine some light into the clerk 's world . <p> The chosen few Clerkships are often secured by an " old boy network " of professors and judges - a method that many clerks defend as practical . Professors friendly with justices , many from Harvard or Yale , early identify star pupils . Clerks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law school these days , because of the hot competition . Clerk hopefuls apply to one or more justices , who have different systems for selection . They submit a transcript of grades , awards , activities , and a writing sample . But letters of recommendation are crucial - as is the final interview . " If Harvard law professor Larry Tribe calls and says he 's got the perfect candidate , that person has a good chance - partly because Tribe does n't make many recommendations , " one clerk intimated . Then there are " superclerks . " These hopefuls apply to some 20 well-known federal " feeder " judges , such as Michael Luttig of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals or Laurence Silberman of the influential Court of Appeals in Washington . The understanding is that some will later ascend to clerkships at the high court . Some justices do their own selecting . Others farm the work to clerks or to a panel of former clerks , the method used by the late Thurgood Marshall . The final interview may deal with the law ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be mainly a character assessment . In a 45-minute interview with former Justice Harry Blackmun , ex-clerk Ed Lazarus was never asked a substantive question . Instead , Justice Blackmun asked about Mr. Lazarus 's hobbies and family . Lazarus remembers at one point jumping on the justice 's couch and juggling several balls , to show his pluck . Justice Rehnquist was criticized this spring when it came to light he had never hired a black clerk . USA Today found that four current justices have never hired an African-American clerk . The justices now sitting on the high court have hired , in their tenures , a total of 394 clerks . Blacks and Hispanics make up 3 percent of those , and women are 1 in 4 . Court insiders say racism is not the reason for few minorities . Rather , they point to the narrow pool in which about 60 percent of clerks are from three schools : Harvard , Yale , and the University of Chicago . " I truly do n't think Rehnquist reflects animus to blacks , " argues Michael Dorf , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservative , he 's got more intellectual diversity among clerks than many of his liberal colleagues , like Justice William Brennan , had . The problem is that too few African-Americans graduate at the top of the small group of schools the court relies on . " For all his liberality and defense of minorities , Justice Brennan , for example , never hired a female clerk until the last two years he was on the court . The ideal clerk can see through the dense outer layer of a case into the heart of the legal question involved , and examine it from several vantage points . Again and again , former clerks say the job requires not only legal skill , but also a willingness to defend a position if the justice challenges it . " It takes gumption for a 27-year-old to be willing to argue with a justice , " says Lazarus , whose book " Closed Chambers " about his year as a clerk has stirred anger in the US legal community for allegedly revealing court secrets . " But that is part of the job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a yes man . " <p> Job for a year Not all clerks are up to the task . Some have intellectual firepower but not the crucial attention to detail that is needed . And vice versa . But no clerk has ever been dismissed . " You ca n't always tell , " says Tom Goldstein , who tracks the court for the Washington law firm Boies and Shiller . " It 's like trying to pick the most brilliant chemistry student in college and saying , ' That person is going to win the Nobel Prize . ' You ca n't . " As the term progresses , the clerks each write about 150 five-page memos on prospective cases . They write 20 to 50 " bench memos , " each 30 pages long , detailing for their own justice the issues in cases the court has taken . In the meantime , they handle death-penalty appeals and spend much time with clerks of other justices working out the final wording and reasoning of decisions . Finally , in their crowning task , the clerks write the drafts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigation and concentration . " As the term gets thicker , you have to clinch-it-out , " says Lazarus . " You are trying to husband your time to draft the opinion that becomes the law of the land . If you do n't churn out the paperwork , everything begins to get difficult . " Those who argue that clerks have little influence note that the justices decide their own votes , as well as outline the argument and legal precedents in meetings with their clerks . Mr. Caminker argues , however , that justices can have different reasons for voting yes or no on cases - and that these differences often are identified and sorted out among the clerks as one of them writes the first draft of an opinion . " You have to figure out how to write the opinion that will hold a majority , " says Caminker . " By the time you do , much of the initial reasoning is what comes out of your research . " Caminker says he did n't get his sea legs on the court until the first opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , I waited with trepidation . After a few days you realize the world has n't ended . The clocks keep ticking , and you begin to feel a part of the court . "
