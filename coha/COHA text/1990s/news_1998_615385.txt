This new book lives up to his reputation . <p> Mindy Klein is the daughter and granddaughter of a family of " little " people , who live behind the walls of the Eldridge Street Synagogue . On the day before Hanukkah , she offers to retrieve the stray candle in the ark that will allow the Kleins to light their tiny Hanukkah menorah . But a cat that Papa calls " a fierce Antiochus , " like the king who persecuted the Jews , stands ready to attack . <p> The story is fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family in early 1900s dress , among furnishings made from small-scale discards , stimulate the imagination of children and adults . A keeper : Eric Kimmel has another new book out for Hanukkah , " A Hanukkah Treasury " ( Henry Holt &; Co. , $ 19.95 ) , edited by Kimmel and illustrated by Emily Lisker . Though most of the stories are written by Kimmel , included are tales by other children 's writers , such as Jane Yolen and Howard Schwartz , and storytellers , such as Penina Schram . <p> Games , recipes , directions for making a menorah , and songs , as well as " Rules for lighting the Hanukkah Lamp " make this book a must for families who want to fully experience the holiday . Because actual prayers are included , this is a book to be kept on a shelf and then shared with children of all ages .

Universal message : Children a little older ( 5-8 ) might enjoy " The Gift " ( Aladdin Paperback , $ 5.99 ) by Aliana Brodmann , illustrated by Anthony Carnabuci . In " The Gift , " a little girl in Germany , many years ago , goes shopping to spend the 5 mark piece her father gave her for Hanukkah . Though she finds items she 'd love to own in several stores she visits , she ca n't seem to part with the money until she hears a beautiful tune . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but except for the first page that mentions the Hanukkah money , there 's no other reference to the Jewish holiday . In fact , in one shop , the child notices beautifully wrapped boxes because " it was Christmastime , " an observation that seems out of place . Still " The Gift " is worth reading for its poetic prose , universal message of kindness , and haunting , realistic pictures . An artistic view : In a more traditional telling of Hanukkah , " The Menorah Story " ( Greenwillow Books , $ 15 ) , writer and illustrator Mark Podwal leaves out the details in his semiabstract drawings as he focuses on one or two colors for impact . The text is also stirring . <p> It begins with the story of God trying to teach Moses how to make a menorah . But Moses could n't seem to do it . So God told him to throw a piece of gold into the fire , which he did , and the first menorah was formed by itself . <p> Then the author explains the significance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was said that the menorah 's seven lights symbolized the six days of Creation with the light in the center representing the Sabbath , the day of rest . . . . For hundreds of years a golden menorah burned day and night at the center of the Holy Temple , which was at the center of the city of Jerusalem , which was at the center of the world . <p> " But there came a time when the lights of the menorah went out , " writes Podwal . That 's how he introduces the story of Hanukkah . Podwal , whose drawings have appeared in The New York Times and New York 's Metropolitan Museum of Art , presents a clear picture of Hanukkah through the complement of words and color . Hanukkah and the Holocaust : Few other Hanukkah books are as sensitive as " Nine Spoons " ( Hachai Publishing , $ 11.95 ) by Marci Stillerman , pictures by Pesach Gerber . Based on fact , it 's the story of a group of women prisoners in a Nazi concentration camp who put themselves in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoons for the children of the camp . It tells of love and courage , even in the face of cruelty . <p> The story , as related by " Oma " to her grandchildren on the eighth night of Hanukkah , may be difficult for parents to present to their children , but the message of hope is important . <p> " For eight nights , we lit the flames in our menorah , and the children had a Chanukah to remember , " says Oma at the end of the book . Several of her grandchildren , with sweet , round faces , so different from the thin , drawn ones of the children in the camp , say , " I 'll always remember . " And so will the reader of " Nine Spoons . " Musical winner : On a lighter note , a musical board book may be the biggest hit of the season .
