<p> EVERY few weeks , the Key family in Los Gatos , Calif. receives a large basket delivered right to their doorstep . The contents : ultra-fresh organic fruits and vegetables . The family of four never knows exactly what will be in the basket , but they know it will be a good variety of what 's in season for that week . <p> " I like the delivery . I like the surprise . And I like that they 're grown without pesticides , " says Lynette Key . <p> Environmentalists would consider Ms. Key 's family a good example of people who eat with the earth in mind . By buying locally grown organic produce , they support farming practices that are considered sound for the long-term . <p> This Saturday , which is Earth Day this year , some Americans may wonder : How do my food choices affect the environment ? <p> " Very powerfully , " answers John Robbins , founder of EarthSave , a nonprofit organization that promotes what it deems environmentally sound food choices . " Whatever we eat has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and soil - that is our agricultural resource base . " <p> Buying from local farmers and choosing organic produce , if it 's available , are two ways of supporting earth-friendly food , activists say . If food is local , it probably has n't been transported a long distance . If it 's organic , it has n't been cultivated with the use of pesticides and herbicides . <p> " If you ca n't get fully organic food , do n't throw up your hands , " Robbins says . There 's a tremendous difference , he says , between commercial agribusiness 's mass-produced foods and foods that may not qualify as organic but nevertheless use far fewer chemicals . <p> But Robbins 's No. 1 suggestion for adopting a more environmentally sound diet is to simply eat less meat . <p> In the past century , there has been a fundamental shift of diet in this country toward more meat , poultry , and dairy , he says . " This increase in demand for animal products has resulted in vast degradation of global ecosystems . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and energy efficient , says Robbins , author of " May All Be Fed " ( William Morrow , 1992 ) , and " Diet for a New America " ( Stillpoint , 1987 ) . <p> " It takes about 16 pounds of grain to make one pound of feedlot beef . All our mothers taught us ' Do n't waste food . ' But in effect , every time we consume a beef-based meal , we are actually throwing away 15 pounds of grain . " <p> Dan Hale , an associate professor at Texas A &M; University who specializes in meat science points out , " a lot of people do n't realize that even with only 19 percent of our total cropland being utilized , we have a tremendous glut of grain in our country . " <p> The idea of restraining one 's consumption reflects a new attitude of frugality among Americans . Excess is out , sustainability is in , and considering the earth 's future has become fashionable . Conscious that everything is connected in a global ecosystem , people are more aware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are reciting the three Rs : reduce , reuse , recycle . <p> " I think frugality has to become more of an operative word for us . Not in a penny-pinching way but in a way that 's motivated by the recognition of the earth 's finite resources , " says Lorna Sass , food historian and author of " Recipes from an Ecological Kitchen . See story and recipe , right . " I do believe people want to do good things for themselves and the earth . But it does require a certain commitment . " <p> Ms. Sass 's outlook is simple : " What 's good for the earth is also good for me . " <p> In an interview , she notes that interpretations of an ecologically correct diet vary . But , she says , many experts from various fields have lauded a diet rich in grains , fruits , and vegetables . Sass takes it further by stressing organic produce . And she is in good company . <p> Organic produce and the safest seafood , poultry , and meats - produced in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by some of the best-known chefs in America . <p> " Our preference is always to go organic and with beef and poultry free of hormones and chemicals - the freshest and the safest , " says Joyce Goldstein , owner of Square One restaurant in San Francisco . " We believe in hand-crafted food . " <p> " It 's definitely a trend among chefs , " says Charlie Trotter , owner of Charlie Trotter 's restaurant in Chicago . " I like to believe that through my type of purchasing - small farmers and organic - that I 'm playing one small part in preserving and keeping the land in a condition where it will continue to flourish , provide good produce . " <p> Similar reasoning has even arrived at the White House . <p> In his book " Earth In the Balance , " Vice President Al Gore talks of " dangerous bargains with the future " concerning this country 's present agricultural practices . <p> A coalition of CHEFS ( Chefs Helping to Enhance Food Safety ) is urging President Clinton to embrace a philosophy at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce and stricter standards for the quality of fish , poultry , and meat . A leading spokeswoman for CHEFS is Alice Waters , owner of Chez Panisse in Berkeley , Calif . <p> Ms. Waters says there needs to be more awareness of food 's connection to the environment . " Unfortunately people are not understanding that the food is coming from the earth and the water . People just think it comes from the grocery store , " she says . <p> A longtime supporter of local organic produce , Waters says she is encouraged by the proliferation of local green markets or farmers markets , calling it " the healthiest thing happening . It 's the best way of getting in touch with people who are taking care of the land for us . " <p> " Taking care " is a key phrase , notes Jim Wilson , farmer for Wilson Farms in Lexington , Mass . Sustainable agriculture is becoming a predominant theme , he says , adding that it 's in a farmer 's best interest to use as few pesticides as possible . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world without some use of pesticides . " <p> Many food trends are pointing in the direction of a more earth-friendly diet : salad bars and juice machines , for example . <p> Also , vegetarianism has moved from the fringe into the fabric of social acceptance . " By and large , it is respected now . It 's seen as a healthy choice , an ecological choice , and an ethical choice , " Robbins says . <p> College cafeterias and deluxe restaurants are offering many more nonmeat entrees than in the past . The USDA has revamped its suggested diet from the " four food groups " to the new " pyramid , " which stresses more grains , fruits , and vegetables and less meat than before . Even McDonald 's is experimenting with a meat-free burger . <p> Natural foods stores and restaurants report a broader crosssection of customers . <p> " It 's really fun eating low on the food chain , " says Leslie McEachern , owner of Angelica Kitchen , an organic vegetarian restaurant in New York 's East Village . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says she also gets " fur coats " and " a Wall Street crowd . " <p> " The more we can promote this kind of cuisine , the better , " she says , adding : " Maybe Earth Day will become a holiday . "
