<p> The largest union on strike against Detroit 's daily newspapers made a new effort to end the nine-month walkout . Company officials say the union proposed to renew its expired contract with changes tentatively agreed to earlier . <p> The April 9 proposal was the first significant move toward a settlement in months , but involved only Teamsters Local 372 . Both sides said much work remains to end what is now the longest newspaper strike in Detroit history . <p> Still , both sides sounded more upbeat than they have in recent months . <p> " I 'm cautiously optimistic that as we delve into their proposal and see what the ramifications are , hopefully we can move to end the conflict , " said Frank Vega , president of Detroit Newspapers Inc . <p> Al Derey , Local 372 's lead negotiator and chairman of the Metropolitan Council of Newspaper Unions , declined to discuss details of the offer or the talks . He indicated , however , that the discussions were significant . <p> " We discussed issues that earlier gave both sides a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're talking and you meet , that 's progress . <p> " Hopefully , we can give you some good news in the future . But I 'm not holding my breath . " <p> Both sides appeared April 15 before an administrative law judge for an oft-delayed hearing on a National Labor Relations Board complaint alleging that management bargained unfairly with the unions . <p> About 2,500 workers from six union locals went on strike July 13 against The Detroit News , the Detroit Free Press and Detroit Newspapers , which runs their business and production operations . <p> Local 372 represents about 1,150 drivers , circulation workers and customer service representatives . <p> Two Detroit Newspapers officials met with five members of the Local 372 bargaining team for about 30 minutes April 9 at the union 's request . They last met in November . <p> Newspaper officials said the Teamsters dropped demands for higher pay and other contract changes that management had opposed . Union officers declined to comment . <p> One possible sign of a shift in the strike was the conciliatory tone offered by Vega @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strikers ' wrath . <p> " We are very aware of the hardships the strikers and their families have undergone , and of what this has meant for the Detroit community , " he said . " We would like nothing better than to see this episode brought to a conclusion . " <p> Tim Kelleher , Detroit Newspapers ' vice president of labor relations , said management would study the offer and could return to the bargaining table as soon as this week . <p> Vega and Kelleher made it clear that changes to the old contract would be needed to deal with the realities of a smaller staff and production changes made since the strike began . <p> " One of the things we have said all along is we 're not going to go back to the old way of doing things , " Vega said . <p> There also is the issue of more than 1,400 replacement workers management has hired and promised not to let go even if there is a settlement . <p> " If and when we reach a settlement , we think there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be on an as-needed basis , " Kelleher said . <p> Management is willing to explore other options , such as a job-training fund to help strikers find jobs elsewhere , he said . <p> Derey said the latest proposal did not specifically address the issue of returning strikers to work . <p> Roger Kerson , spokesman for the union council , said the Teamsters were not acting independently of the other unions . <p> " Each of the striking unions has met periodically with management , and each union is looking to resolve issues affecting its members , " he said . " I would view what happened today as part of that process . " <p> Detroit Newspapers estimates that combined daily circulation is down about 200,000 because of a subscription boycott ; strike-related losses last year were estimated at nearly $ 100 million . <p> Kelleher said management may propose to meet with the Teamsters this week at night , a move Vega endorsed . <p> " The more meetings we can have and the more clearly we can define the issues , the sooner we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kelleher said Local 372 and Detroit Newspapers tentatively agreed to several changes in the old contract before and after the strike began , but he said it has been so long that he could not remember what they were . <p> Kelleher said the Teamsters proposed that management first negotiate noneconomic issues with each of the six union locals separately , then bargain jointly on economic issues . <p> Vega said there have been about 50 meetings with union officials since the strike began , but most have been unproductive . <p> On April 14 , representatives of the United Auto Workers and the AFL-CIO as well as national Teamsters leaders gathered at Cobo Hall in support of the strikers . The UAW <p> Carolyn Forrest , UAW vice president , said the UAW has contributed $ 100,000 to the newspaper strike fund , made $ 150 contributions to each striking family over the holidays , and refuses to grant interviews to replacement reporters . <p> Some 2,000 union members attended the two-hour rally , which included speeches , live music and gospel singing .

LOUIS ( AP ) - A federal appeals court will decide whether the sale of a northwestern Arkansas newspaper violated antitrust laws or whether the case is now moot since the paper has been resold . <p> Attorneys from several sides lined up April 11 before a three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to argue the sale of the Northwest Arkansas Times of Fayetteville , Ark . <p> Mark S. Popofsky , attorney for the U.S. Department of Justice , said the case is n't moot because NAT , L.C. , which purchased the Times from Thomson Newspapers Inc. of Stamford , Conn. , could try to buy the paper in the future . <p> NAT , based in Little Rock , Ark. , bought the paper in February 1995 but was ordered by U.S. District Judge H. Franklin Waters of Fayetteville to rescind the deal because it could give owners a monopoly . One of NAT 's principals , Jackson T. Stephens , owns Donrey Media Group , parent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which abuts Fayetteville . <p> Waters ruled that competition would be eliminated between the Fayetteville and Springdale papers because of Stephens ' interest in both corporations . <p> Attorney Amy Lee Stewart , representing NAT and Donrey , argued that the sale did n't violate antitrust laws . She told the panel that attorneys for the plaintiffs did n't adequately define the newspaper 's product market , which is based on its advertising and readership base . <p> Without that definition , a monopoly can not be established , Stewart said . <p> Efforts by newspaper owners to acquire other papers and compete with other forms of media will be hampered if the ruling is upheld , Stewart said . She asked that the lawsuit be dismissed . <p> The lawsuit was brought by Community Publishers , publisher of the Benton County Daily Record and Shearin and Company Realtors , both of Bentonville , Ark . Bentonville is about 15 miles north of Springdale . <p> Philip S. Anderson , attorney for Community Publishers , said NAT paid $ 22 million - twice its value - for the Times because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violations . <p> After the sale was rescinded by Waters , the Times was sold in September 1995 to American Publishing Co. of West Frankfort , Ill . <p> The case was taken under advisement by Judges David R.

Wollman . <p> The 1996 Pulitzer Prizes honored exposes on eggs stolen from the womb , cigarette nicotine tinkering and a Bosnian massacre , along with the enduring image of a firefighter cradling a tiny victim of the Oklahoma City bombing . <p> The New York Times won three prizes and Newsday two .

Two of the three doctors implicated in the series fled the country . <p> " Journalists work all their professional lives for this moment , " said Tonnie L.

" But the most fulfilling thing would be to see the perpetrators of the Srebrenica massacre brought to justice .

Soon after , much of the world saw the image that came to symbolize the shock and sorrow of the Oklahoma City bombing . <p> On April 9 , Porter , a bank credit officer who took photos as a hobby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the free-lance photo . <p> The picture was distributed to newspapers worldwide exclusively by The Associated Press and was the news service 's sixth Pulitzer winner in six years , five of them photos , and 40th overall . <p> The other spot news photography finalists also came from the AP - a staff portfolio of photos from Chechnya and pictures by Jerome Delay for coverage of the Middle East and Bosnia . <p> The AP photographers who covered Chechnya were Dave Brauchli , Mindaugas Kulbis , Alexander Zemlianichenko and Sergei Karpukhin , all based in Moscow ; Peter Dejong , based in Amsterdam ; Efrem Lukatsky , based in Kiev , Ukraine ; and Olga Shalygin , based in San Francisco . <p> It is believed to be the first time one organization had all finalists in one category , said Fred Knubel , director of public information at Columbia University , which oversees the prizes . <p> For Porter , who grabbed his camera at work when he heard the blast , journalism 's highest honor brought little joy . <p> " I 'm honored to win , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and champagne bottles , " Porter said . " I do n't want to lose sight of the fact that this picture represents anyone and everyone who was involved in this tragedy . " <p> Baylee Almon was one of 19 children killed in the April 19 bombing , which claimed 168 lives and injured more than 500 . <p> Vin Alabiso , AP vice president and executive photo editor , said the photo " forced a world to reflect on the devastating toll exacted by an act of terrorism . " <p> " The tragic death of this innocent child is etched in history , " he said . " She will always be remembered and mourned because of it . " <p> Porter was at work at a bank 2 blocks away when the bomb ripped through the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building . At first he thought an old building was being demolished , but he soon realized he was wrong . <p> " There was glass everywhere , there were people bleeding , running around hurt everywhere , " he said . <p> When Porter went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard his pictures came from the bombing and asked for a look . " They started looking at them , and they just started crying , " Porter said . <p> On the advice of Dan Smith , a photo instructor at the University of Central Oklahoma , Porter took the pictures to the AP bureau , where Chief of Bureau Lindel Hutson picked two frames out of the stack and bought first-time rights to them . <p> " I flipped through four or five , and then came to the two that absolutely stunned me , " Hutson said . <p> One showed a police officer handing the baby to firefighter Chris Fields . In the second , Fields looked down at the baby in his arms . <p> Porter did n't realize the impact of moving a picture on the wire until he got home and the Times of London called , followed by Time magazine , followed by what seemed like the rest of the world . <p> With the publicity came headaches . Porter found himself dealing with the feelings of Baylee 's mother , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Porter and Aren Almon seldom speak , and she expressed mixed feelings about his Pulitzer . <p> " I 'm glad for him , because that 's a big accomplishment .

Ambrose gave preliminary approval April 12 to the settlement between E.W. Scripps Co. of Cincinnati and the employees . <p> If the settlement receives final approval in August , it would resolve two lawsuits , one brought by six former workers in 1993 and a class action claim filed in 1994 . <p> " This is a very good settlement , " said Roslyn M. Litman , a lawyer for the employees .

But the employees argued they were , in effect , terminated because their Press seniority did not apply in their new positions . <p> Ambrose ruled in favor of the employees last December , and Scripps appealed . Under the agreement , Scripps will drop the appeal . <p> Also under the agreement , Litman must draw up a plan by June 25 to distribute the settlement among employees . The amounts paid will be based on factors such as length of service , classification and how much severance pay they have already received . <p> Arizona APME Honored for Public Records Project <p> PHOENIX ( AP ) - The Arizona Associated Press Managing Editors ' Association has won the 1995 First Amendment Award for its special project examining access to public records . <p> The award was presented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Society of Professional Journalists , which represents journalists from the entire state . <p> Kirk Mitchell , a reporter for the Tribune Newspapers , was also honored at the meeting with the Sunshine Award for a variety of public interest stories , including ones about halfway hours , welfare fraud and Medicare billing records . <p> The seven-part series , " Focus on Public Records , " examined the state 's public records law and how it is being applied .

Twenty-one percent said seldom , 4 percent never . <p> In comparison , the baby boomers - Americans age 30 to 49 , born in the post-World War II years - read papers somewhat more consistently , the study found . <p> Thirty-seven percent said they read papers every day , 16 percent almost every day . Only 14 percent said " seldom , " and 2 percent said never . <p> The study was conducted by Yankelovich Partners of Norwalk , Conn .

Rajendran ruled that Lingle knowingly defamed the Singaporean leader and must pay him $ 71,000 . <p> Lingle 's conduct - of repeating the libel in another article and not apologizing - shows that " he was motivated by malice and was intent on injuring ( Lee ) as widely and gravely as possible , " Rajendran said . <p> He ruled that Lee should be compensated for the libel with more than $ 285,000 in damages . But because the Tribune has already paid him $ 214,000 , he should not be entitled to recover more than the balance - $ 71,000 - from Lingle , Rajendran said . <p> Lingle , 47 , fled to the United States once police began investigating him after the article appeared and had no comment on the ruling . <p> Lingle had lost the lawsuit by default after refusing to appear in court . He was n't represented in court at the damages hearing . <p> It is not clear how Singapore can enforce the ruling to recover the damages from Lingle . Singapore has confiscated Lingle 's personal library @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Singapore government pension account . <p> Lingle and executives of the Paris-based Tribune also have been convicted of contempt of court and fined a few thousand dollars total . <p> Lingle did not name Singapore in his article , which referred to " intolerant regimes in the region , " but Lee maintained that Lingle was referring to Singapore , which prides itself on an honest government and independent judiciary . That reputation is based largely on the efforts of Lee , prime minister from 1959 to 1990 . <p> The Tribune also was found guilty of libel over a separate 1994 article that alleged nepotism in Singapore . <p> The newspaper also apologized for that article and paid more than $ 678,000 in damages to Lee ; his son , deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong , and Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong . <p> The three leaders have donated the money to charities . <p> Singapore has a tradition of confrontation with the foreign media .

That 's not a news program . " <p> CBS News will add reporters , contributors and support staff to Newspath , its affiliate news service , but Heyward acknowledged that CBS ' expansion is leverage for the affiliates to boost their own morning presence . <p> " I never heard of a boat sinking on just one side , " he said . <p> There has been no decision on the future of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or weather reporter Mark McEwen . <p> ' Inside Edition ' Crew Barred from Invading Couple 's Privacy <p> PHILADELPHIA ( AP ) - A federal judge has barred two journalists for the syndicated TV show " Inside Edition " from following two executives of a health maintenance organization and invading their privacy . <p> U.S. District Judge Raymond J. Broderick , saying the case pitted free press against privacy , ruled that the First Amendment does n't protect the news media from " torts and crimes committed in the pursuit of a story . " <p> " The use of sophisticated video and recording equipment by TV journalists has increased the threat that a person 's right to privacy may be violated , " he wrote in an opinion filed April 8 . <p> Reporter Stephen Wilson and producer Paul Lewis had followed Nancy and Richard Wolfson , officers of U.S. Healthcare , earlier this year while working on an expose about high executive salaries at HMOs . The show 's crew surreptitiously followed the Wolfsons , recording them when possible with cameras hidden inside vans , the opinion said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , head of U.S. Healthcare . Abramson earned about $ 4 million in salary , bonuses and other compensation in 1994 as head of U.S. Healthcare . The Wolfsons earned about $ 800,000 in salary and bonuses , a 1994 corporate proxy statement showed . <p> The surveillance , discovered by the couple 's security guards , started after Abramson refused to grant an interview . Broderick said there was enough evidence to show the journalists hoped Abramson would grant an interview to stop the badgering . <p> The Wolfsons testified in February that they feared for their children 's lives until they learned that the people trailing them were journalists . <p> The injunction is to remain in effect pending a trial . The couple is seeking undisclosed damages . <p> An " Inside Edition " statement defended the conduct of the two journalists . <p> It said that retired Newsday assistant managing editor Bob Greene , a two-time Pulitzer Prize winner , agreed in testimony as an expert witness that Wilson and Lewis ' conduct " was consistent with journalistic standards .

The video will be stored and retrieved on computers by Sun Microsystems Inc. and Silicon Graphics Inc . <p> TV networks now conduct private satellite broadcasts to their affiliates with raw news footage , commercials and the like .

MCI will install the lines at the stations involved in the test , which includes all of NBC 's affiliates in Texas and some in Michigan , Oregon and Virginia . <p> Ray Kang , director of broadband and multimedia marketing at MCI , said the network costs are not much higher than data systems used by many companies . <p> For MCI , the test is a high-profile demonstration of the equipment integration and software programming capabilities it has recently developed to server big companies with ambitious ideas for merging computer and communications technology . <p> The companies announced their venture to coincide with the National Association of Broadcasters convention , which opened in Las Vegas April 15 . <p> A federal appeals court , siding with NBC in a long-running wage dispute , has ruled that journalists must be classified as " artistic professionals " in certain cases . The decision would deprive them of legal entitlement to overtime pay . <p> The ruling in the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a federal court that said three employees who sued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said they might appeal to the Supreme Court . <p> The judgment could have far-reaching implications for news people working for major news organizations . The new classification might remove some journalists from the protection of the Fair Labor Standards Act . <p> Enacted in 1935 , the FLSA was designed to assure hourly wage workers time-and-a-half for overtime . It provides exemptions for " learned professionals , " like doctors or lawyers , and " artistic professionals . " <p> Since then , news reporters have not been considered artistic professionals , but trained laborers . But the April 3 ruling in the NBC case held that journalists at major news organizations are artistic professionals . <p> Lawyers for NBC argued that the nature of television news requires a high degree of creativity and interpretation . <p> In the appeals court opinion , written by Judge John M. Walker Jr. , the court held that the law was meant to halt substandard working conditions . It added that reporters ' jobs at small-town news operations have not changed much from 1949-era journalism , but have at major news operations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Concord ( N.H. ) Monitor that most of its reporters , editors and photographers were exempt from the federal legislation and need not be paid overtime . The appellate court upheld a judge 's order to the Monitor to pay a total of almost $ 21,000 to 10 reporters and two photographers . <p> However , in another recent case at The Washington Post , a federal judge ruled that a former Washington Post reporter was an artistic professional whose primary duty consisted of work requiring invention , imagination and talent . The reporter therefore was exempt from overtime provisions , the judge said . <p> That reporter , Tom Sherwood , filed an appeal in January 1995 , but his lawyer , Robert E. Paul , said the appeal was withdrawn last fall as part of a settlement with the Post . He declined further comment . <p> Salt Lake Organizing Committee Picks Host Broadcaster <p> SALT LAKE CITY ( AP ) - The Salt Lake Organizing Committee selected Manolo Romero 's International Sports Broadcasting as host broadcaster for the 2002 Winter Games . <p> Romero has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been involved in the television broadcasting of seven Winter Games . <p> As host broadcaster , ISB will distribute television and radio signals to the international community .
