Dennis Rodman 's Floating World <p> And so are Whoopi Goldberg , Toni Braxton , Ahmad Rashad , Jean-Claude Van Damme , Chris Rock , Hootie , Madonna and Eddie Vedder . And let 's not forget Monique and Judy <p> Let me tell you about Dennis Rodman 's dreams . Most of them are about one subject . <p> Death . <p> dennis rodman : I dream about death all the time , just because I know it 's coming one day , and for some reason I 've got to figure out which way to go , how it 's gon na happen . It 's a weird feeling . You name every way in the world , I 've thought of all of them . <p> me : You 've dreamed of shooting yourself . <p> dennis rodman : Yeah . You name it ; I 've dreamed it all . <p> me : You 've dreamed of being in flames and falling off a building . <p> dennis rodman : Yeah . Impatiently I 've dreamed someone pulled my heart out . I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've dreamed of getting my head chopped off . <p> me : Is n't it all just . . . a horrible feeling ? <p> dennis rodman : It makes me feel good because I 'm still living . And I 've survived it . I keep surviving it . <p> This is a journey into the mind of Dennis Rodman . Think twice before volunteering to go further . Sometimes it will be funny , but sometimes it will be scary . Sometimes the paranoia and craziness will seep out of the page to get you . Sometimes you wo n't quite understand what Dennis Rodman is saying . Sometimes you will and wish you did n't . There will be casualties . Logic , love , basketball , fashion . . . these will all take a battering . You will not be lied to , but sometimes the truth will seem elusive . This trip will take in an array of guests , and not all of them will be pleased to find themselves in Rodman-land . It will be fun , in a way , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble and sadness , and never quite untangles itself . In the end , life wo n't seem simpler , and the world wo n't seem a safer place . <p> Do n't forget : We are just tourists here . We will be going home . But Dennis Rodman ca n't leave . This is where he lives . <p> I ask Dennis Rodman to think back . " Shit , " he says . " Not many pleasant moments . I know that . I really do n't think of pictures of me being young . " He will tell me , with a certain mock-poetic melodrama , " I was n't into nothing . I was a lost child in a world of just total destruction . It was like being in the Thunderdome , because everything was cheat , deceitfulness , lies , stealing . . . you name it . " <p> His father left home when Dennis was 3 . " All I can remember is riding in the car , " he says . " He took us out for ice cream before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my father being around . I woke up the next day , and he was n't . " <p> This summer , Philander Rodman Jr. , Dennis ' father , turned up in the world 's media . He is living in the Philippines . He boasted to the Washington Post that he has sired 27 children and is " shooting for 30 . " <p> Dennis professes to care neither about his father 's reappearance nor his antics . " If he wants to go and fuck everything in the world , go ahead . If you want to have 100 babies , hell , I hope you break the world record . " <p> The fatherless child spent a lot of time alone . " I did n't want to be around anybody . I was really scared to lash out and mingle with other kids . I thought I was different-looking than anybody else . " His ears were big and stuck way out . " Especially in the projects , they really made fun of you , " he remembers . " ' Ears ! ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> So he stayed inside his room and inside his head . " I 'd try to make my own imaginative life . I always visualized being something , visualized doing weird shit in my life . I always thought that , since I was young . " He believed something special would happen . His favorite figure was Julius Caesar : " He just built the Empire ! " <p> Rodman imitates the admirable Roman emperor in action : " This is the fucking thing ! This is the way it is ! This is the way I 'm gon na do it ! You may kiss my ass or die ! " <p> Maybe , he says , he and Caesar are related . <p> This is how Dennis Rodman shakes a stranger 's hand : He greets the incoming paw with his own extra-large , supersize right hand . ( Dennis Rodman calls his right hand Monique . The left is Judy . I 'll explain later . ) Monique does n't do anything funky or intricate . Takes the new hand firmly but gently . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dennis will say nothing ; sometimes he 'll say something  --  " Hey , bro "  --  that means the same nothing . Meanwhile , as Monique completes its forward motion , Dennis ' head begins to turn . Usually to the left . Away , anyway , from all this **25;2500;TOOLONG nonsense . The hand stays , but the head is gone . You get Monique but not Dennis . <p> The first time I introduce myself to Dennis Rodman , I get this stranger 's handshake . He says nothing to recognize that he has heard a word I have said , just twists that head and walks away . About half an hour later , in a crowd of people , he turns to me and says , " Rolling Stone , huh ? " <p> Day after day , I will follow him . He accepts my presence , but he does not necessarily encourage it . Often his head is turned . Sometimes he will tap me on the shoulder . It 'll go something like this : " You thinking over there ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll shrug . " Bet you thinking , " he 'll say and move off . <p> It will take a week , and a trip to another continent , before I actually get him to talk into a tape recorder . <p> One night when I begin to wonder aloud whether Dennis and I will ever really speak , Dwight Manley , his business manager , gives me some decent advice . " He 's like a wild horse , " Dwight explains . " If you go right up to him , he 'll get spooked . You have to walk around him and wait for him to come up to you . Once in a while he 'll kiss you , but you have to wait for him to come up and take your sugar . " <p> Dwight and Dennis met at the Las Vegas craps tables a couple of years back . " No big deal at all , " says Dennis Rodman . " He said , ' I can help you manage your money . ' That 's basically the story . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in rare coins . He implies that he took over Dennis ' finances because he could n't bear to see the mess they were in . Dennis Rodman may be the greatest rebounder of the modern era , but he 's not the greatest businessman . Dwight tells me that when they started working together , Rodman was in debt , and since then his off-court earnings have risen from $100,000 a year to more than $10 million , his total earnings from $2.5 million to more than $20 million . <p> These are some other things Dwight tells me : " I 'm the promoter . He 's the cream in the pie , and it 's delicious every time . . . . People try to take advantage of him and turn him into a circus act . . . . Who is he ? I 'd like to say he 's the best entertainer in sports . . . . Dennis has got soul and character , and that 's what is magnetizing . But he 's struggled . He 's a nobody from nowhere who should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak ; he 'd break out in hives . He 'd hide behind his mother . He was a 20-year-old virgin . . . . It 's refining him a little bit . . . . some things he was doing were too goofy , it was destructive ; trying to buy happiness , money became very destructive to him , it brought him headaches . . . . He was a crackpot , he was a loser , he was the Madonna boy toy , he was a distraction to the team . The press had its way with him , now we have our way with the press . . . . I love him . I would do anything for him . " <p> I 'm gon na drive you in my bus , " Dennis Rodman tells Whoopi Goldberg . " You sit right next to me . " <p> Rodman is in New York this week filming his MTV series , The Rodman World Tour , one of several new additions to the Rodman portfolio . " Just to see if I can do it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm a failure . " Cameramen will follow him around as he lives his life and has a few specially scheduled " spontaneous " encounters with fellow celebrities . MTV has hired a tour bus ( it belongs to Waylon Jennings ) , and Dennis has taken to driving it through the streets of New York himself . <p> " Dennis , be our tour guide , " shouts the producer as we head off . " What 's on your right ? " <p> We are passing the Metropolitan Museum of Art . <p> " I do n't know , " Dennis Rodman says . " Something ancient . " <p> Earlier , when Dennis had wandered off , MTV asked Whoopi a few questions about her host . " We 're talking the greatest ass in the world , " she said . " That ass is rock hard . Bouncing dollar bills off it . Bouncing paper money . " Now she is asked , in front of him , about his ass . <p> " No , " she says , " I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a great ass . His brain is his best feature . Asses come and go . Brains are forever . " <p> " Asses come and go , " Dennis nods . " I like that . " <p> Tonight , Dennis will be presenting at the MTV Video Music Awards . " I 'm trying to get him with better people , company CEOs and so on , and not the riffraff , " Dwight tells me . " Tonight I 've got him going to the awards with a supermodel . I fixed that up . He would have just gone with a stripper . " <p> The model is Russian . Dennis ca n't think of her name . <p> " Do you , like , talk to them ? " Whoopi teases . " Do you have conversations ? " <p> " No , " he says , " they 're just there . " <p> The MTV producer asks about Stacy . Stacy is a stripper whom he has been dating for the last couple of years . " Stacy 's cool , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have a girlfriend . Do n't want a girlfriend . " <p> Later he will concede that Stacy is furious not to be his date tonight : " She 's mad as a motherfucker . " <p> ennis Rodman was born 35 years ago . But he may not have aged like other men . One person close to him tells me that he is just heading out of adolescence . " He was a teenager when he started dyeing his hair , " that person says . " That was his puberty . Now he 's 16 , 17 , 18 , 20 . He 's getting to know who he is . " <p> The person who tells me this is Dwight . <p> Another person close to him tells me that Rodman is like a 2-year-old . " A 2-year-old , 6-foot-8-inch kid , " that person says . <p> The person who tells me this is Dennis Rodman . <p> " I think there 's 20 years of my life that has passed me by totally , " he explains . " And now I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I 've wanted to do all my life . And I think I 'm exploring all the possibilities now . " <p> And so you 're like a 2-year-old ? <p> " As far as , ' Gim me , gim me , gim me . Gim me this . Gim me that . Gim me that . ' I want to be happy all the time . I 'm trying to bring those 20 years back , trying to go through those years one by one . " <p> This is how Dennis Rodman figures it out : You sit at home , and maybe somewhere in your head there are 1,000 things you would like to do . But maybe because you 're too laid-back or too conservative , you act only on two of them . The other 998 , you just leave . " You do n't do them , " he says . " Because you think people are going to say , ' You 're weird , you 're fucked up , you 're a devil , you 're Satan , you 're a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his way through the lot . The whole 1,000 . He says that he has completed Phase 1 , which comprises the first 20 of the 1,000 things . These are many of those things that have earned Dennis Rodman his gloriously , triumphantly fucked-up fame . As he puts it : " I think the first phase is challenging death , challenging homosexual , being gay , challenging being afraid not to die , challenging the political part of life . " <p> Next  --  heaven help us , but hell , it 'll entertain us  --  he plans to move on to Phase 2 , which is No. 21 to No. 40 . " I 'm just going to keep adding and adding and adding , " he says . ( He 's vague about the details , though he mysteriously mentions hypnotism and other dimensions . ) <p> When Rodman was 19 , he spent a night in jail . He was working as a janitor at the Dallas-Fort Worth airport . He stole a bunch of watches by sticking a broom handle through the slats in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camera . <p> Jail scared the hell out of him . " It looks like what anyone would imagine , " he says . " This wall . Bars . No TV , no nothing . It 's just you and these four walls , simple as that . You front every bad element in your life , straight off , in your head . You try to make yourself like  --  boom ! I 'm gon na straighten out my life . " <p> His life was turning into a big mess . Then he got tall . " A gift , " he says . " It 's like someone just came to the front door and said , ' Here  --  there 's a gift , right there . Open it up . Here 's a brand-new life if you want it . ' " It took him a long time to realize that he wanted it . The early years of Dennis Rodman 's basketball career are littered with stories of his reluctance , recalcitrance and obstinacy as well-wishers  --  first his sisters , who were both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy , Bryne Rich  --  spotted his potential . ( Bryne Rich  --  that 's a weird episode in The Shaping of Dennis Rodman . When he was 22 , Rodman 's best friend was a 13-year-old in Oklahoma . The Rich family all but adopted Rodman , and many nights he and Bryne would sleep together in the same bed . ) Somehow , by the time Dennis Rodman was 25  --  too late , surely , for anything but a second-string career  --  he was in the NBA . <p> " Now here I am today , " he says , " supposedly one of the biggest stars in the world , or whatever you want to call it . I never planned this . I can do with it , or I can do without it . It does n't matter to me . " If he had n't gotten tall , then he thinks he 'd be working in construction or detailing cars . That way , he fools himself , maybe he would have been easily happy : " Right now I have to keep striving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that one element that 's going to keep me happy at all times . " <p> ME : What 's that element ? <p> DENNIS RODMAN : I think I 've already found it . I think I 've already found the love of my life . I 've found love . Hell , yeah . I 'm just trying to make her understand . <p> ME : Who is that ? Stacy ? <p> DENNIS RODMAN : I think she knows who she is . I do n't like saying her name . <p> ME : Stacy 's ? <p> DENNIS RODMAN : Yeah . <p> ME : So she 's the love of your life , but you 're not with her . That does n't make any sense . <p> DENNIS RODMAN : That makes a lot of sense . A lot of people have said , " That 's the love of my life , but we could n't live together , we could n't be together . " <p> On Aug. 20 , Dennis Rodman announced on the David Letterman show that he was getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York . He showed up in a yellow-orange wig and full bridal drag to sign books . It seemed just another bold , vaguely liberating , gender-crunching publicity stunt with its own pat rationale : " What 's the safest way of getting married today ? Marrying yourself . " But it may not have been that simple or calculated . " I thought I was actually getting married , " he now concedes . He just had n't told Stacy . " It put her in a difficult situation , " he says . I suspect , in truth , Dennis Rodman was just doing what he always does . Recklessly throwing the dice in public . Trying to provoke a reaction from the world . Trying to provoke a reaction from himself . He , as much as us , a spectator in all this . <p> The next morning , Dennis Rodman is scheduled to go busking with Hootie and the Blowfish in Washington Square Park . I find him on the bus , lying on Waylon Jennings ' bed , eating scrambled eggs , bacon and toast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it last night ? " the MTV producer asks him . <p> " Pretty fun , " he says . He went to a few of the post-awards parties . From the back pocket of his jeans , he takes out a bulging wallet . He flips it open so that we can see the driver 's license . It belongs to Toni Braxton , his co-presenter from the night before . Her credit cards , too , and , in the side pocket , her Cartier watch . <p> Soon , Hootie and the Blowfish jump on board . They talk about last night . " I went home by myself , " Dennis Rodman says , then shows them the wallet . He puts on a Pearl Jam bootleg and turns it up loud , too loud to talk . There are ways of seeing this as rude . <p> In the park , Hootie and Dennis take their places on the lip of the fountain . They run through a few covers and what is intended as a theme for Dennis ' show . Darius Rucker improvises some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all his girlfriends , but he ai n't hearing/It 's the Dennis Rodman show . " Dennis holds an egg-shaped percussion shaker and the tambourine . Occasionally he murmurs along under his breath , but he says it 's too early in the day for him to sing . <p> Back on the bus , Dennis tries to phone Toni Braxton . Her hotel pseudonym is Anita Mann . ( Say it to yourself . ) Ms. Mann is not there . He stares at her wallet . " She said she was 28 . Bitch is 30 years old . " This evening her assistant will call , furious . Toni is due on a 7:30 flight , but she ca n't pick up her ticket without ID . They will want Dennis to drive immediately to the airport with her wallet . But he wo n't go , so neither will she . ( Instead they have dinner . " Nothing involved , " he says afterward . " No sex . No nothing . " ) <p> As we sit on the bus , waiting for Dennis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a letter from a girl outside : " I have so much respect for you , " it says . " Your skill and love for your daughter . I would like to shake your hand and split a cab to the tunnel . " <p> There 's a name and phone number . <p> " Is she ugly ? " Dennis asks . The emissary shrugs . Dennis tosses the letter aside . <p> We drive . You can see the Statue of Liberty out the window . " What should I think about it ? " Dennis Rodman muses . " What should I think about that pose ? " He raises his hand in imitation . " It 's just a chick with a damn torch . " Dennis Rodman lies back on the bus bed , the evening sunlight shining off his nose rings . " I totally feel like a rock star more than a basketball player . I totally think : Have I got to go and play basketball now ? " <p> Dennis rodman has proclaimed many times that as his " parting shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game in the nude . I had taken this as just a good , quotable quip , but Dennis Rodman wants me to know that as ambitions go , this is both highly specific and deeply serious . " That will give me the sense of freedom , " he says , " the sense of knowing that I 've fulfilled my goal , my destiny . " <p> ME : So do you think you 'll make it through this season with your clothes on ? <p> DENNIS RODMAN : I 'm contemplating that . Every day I think about that . Yesterday I was talking to some people , saying , " I really do n't want to go back . " There 's nothing for me in basketball anymore . It 's time for me to give the throne up . <p> ME : What will the sense of liberation be when you finally slip out of your basketball clothes ? <p> DENNIS RODMAN : A sense of satisfaction , a sense of pride , a sense of challenging the system of basketball , of saying , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done it , so set me free . " It 's like an animal caged in a zoo . You think that animal wants to be in a fucking zoo for 20 years ? <p> ME : You think the NBA is like a zoo ? <p> DENNIS RODMAN : It is . The money makes you trapped because you 're so engulfed by the millions and millions of dollars and by adoring fans , and people expect so much from you . Then you forget your real identity and purpose of being . For me , I do n't give a fuck about the money . It 's about this right here thumps his chest . I have to be happy here , first . My thinking is , " It 'll set me free from all the trauma , all the anger , all the pain that I 've suffered in this game . " It 's a great game if you can deal with it  --  I 've dealt with it for 11 years  --  but it 's just getting worse , and I do n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the direction it 's going in for me . I just want to leave the game as happy and free . I think it will be the most gratifying feeling in my whole existent life . Everybody thinks I 'm just bullshitting . But I think people are slowly seeing that if I say anything , I 'm gon na do it . <p> ME : I 'm just trying to picture you standing there , naked , in the middle of the basketball court . <p> DENNIS RODMAN : I think I 'll be at the free-throw line . What better place to do it ? Nobody will expect it . I wonder if anybody will come out there , put a towel around me or something . You 'll get some weirdos going , " Oh , my God ! " but I think all in all I 'll get a lot of people looking at it not as a sexual moment . I think people in the papers will pretty much say , " Now he 's free . " That 'll be the headline : Now He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And there 'll be headlines . But I do n't think they 'll say , Now He 's Free ! , and I do n't think he ever quite will be . <p> At Chris Rock 's house in Brooklyn , N.Y. , Rock takes Dennis Rodman upstairs , where he has his Sony PlayStation loaded with the basketball game NBA Shoot Out . Dennis has never seen it , even though Dennis Rodman is one of the characters . <p> " The hair changes every game , " Chris Rock explains . <p> Rock plays ; Rodman watches . " There I am , " he says . " Oh , shit . " He approves of the way Dennis Rodman handles himself , though he is a little surprised when he scores a basket . He notices that something is missing from the Bulls ' lineup . " Michael 's not on there . " <p> " Michael , " says Chris Rock , " has got his own game . " <p> Dennis pulls his own book , Bad as I Wan na Be , off Chris Rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Chris Rock says , turning to the MTV camera , " where he said he would n't eat Madonna out . That really struck me right here . " A pause . " Because . . . would I be that strong ? I do n't know . " <p> Outside , a crowd has gathered . A little girl comes up with a copy of Bad as I Wan na Be . " What you doing with that book ? " asks Dennis . " You 're a little young for it . " <p> She explains that it 's her mother 's . <p> " She particularly loves the Madonna passage , " says Chris Rock . A man makes Rock and Rodman both sign a maxi-pad . ( " It is n't used , " the supplicant says . ) Chris Rock must go . " Have you been on our tour bus ? " Dennis asks . <p> " Next time , " says Chris Rock . " You got other wallets in there ? " <p> Madonna 's diary , May 3 , 1996 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me over . My insomnia has resurfaced the last few nights . . . . Is it because a certain disgusting basketball player I made the mistake of going out with decided to publish an autobiography and devoted a whole chapter to what it was like to have sex with me ? Complete with made-up dialogue that even a bad porno writer would not take credit for " Vanity Fair , " Nov. 1996 . <p> The Madonna chapter is the longest in Dennis Rodman 's book ; it 's fascinating , tawdry and inexcusable . He says that they dated for six months after Madonna interviewed him for a never-published Vibe piece . ( Two months , she says . ) He says she called him Daddy Longlegs , and he called her Tita , and that she would send him faxes saying , " I want every drop of your come inside me . I wo n't let it go because I want your baby . " He described their first night together in lurid detail . <p> ME : Did you talk to her after your book came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think she 's a little bit hot under the collar just because I did n't tell her about it . I tried to call her . One of these days we 'll be friends again . Correcting himself I spoke to her once . Just talking . <p> ME : It was rather nervy to share such intimate things . <p> DENNIS RODMAN : Well , I could have said a lot of worse things about her . I could have made her look like she was a piece of shit or whore . The worst things in the book was about stroking my shaft and munching her carpet . <p> ME : Did you try to get her on your MTV show ? <p> DENNIS RODMAN : I think the world would pay Pay-Per-View to see that . Not to be bigheaded or nothing . They 'd pay millions of dollars to see that . <p> ME : When she interviewed you , what was the best question she asked you ? <p> DENNIS RODMAN : " What makes you so hard inside ? What makes you so angry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why do you think you 're like that ? <p> DENNIS RODMAN : Just because . I 'm not going to tell you everything . You gon na keep asking , I 'm not gon na tell you . Some things you say , and some things you keep to yourself . You can give a great forecast of what the weather 's going to be , but it fucks around and rains on you . It can be sunny and nice , and you look in the eyes and it 's raining . Smiles That 's kind of a fucked-up answer , is n't it ? <p> Two days later . The Rihga Royal Hotel , New York . 9:30 p.m . When I go up to Rodman 's suite , Dwight is sharing Cuban cigars with Rob , an undercover drug-squad detective who sometimes looks after Dennis on his time off , and Ahmad Rashad , who , by chance , is staying across the hall . I can see Dennis lying in the dark on a bed next door , lit up only by the TV flicker , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me are a pile of silver dollars from 1922 and 1923 , and a pile of carpet swatches for the Newport Beach , Calif. , house that Dwight and Dennis own together . <p> There are various plans afoot for the night . Our interview does n't seem to be one of them . Taylor Dayne and an actress , Jennifer Miller , are supposed to be coming around to meet Dennis . ( Dwight knows of Taylor Dayne 's father through the coin business . ) Then they call to suggest meeting at a party Henry Rollins is throwing . Dennis considers it but decides it 's too far away . Everyone wants to see tonight 's heavyweight fight : Mike Tyson against Bruce Seldon . Rodman suggests we watch it at Scores , the strip club where Stacy works . Ahmad Rashad tortures himself about whether he can come . He will be just coming for the fight , not the girls , but he knows how it would look . He mutters something about the brand of popcorn he endorses , and his wife and his reputation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are ushered to the Champagne Room . Girls buzz around . Dennis asks someone to find out whether Stacy is in . The Tyson fight starts . The fight finishes . Less than two minutes . " That 's embarrassing , " says Rodman , shaking his head . " That 's embarrassing . That 's bullshit . Bullshit . " Maybe Rodman 's also a little bit jealous . " Tyson does that for a minute , " he says , " and gets $30 million . " <p> No Stacy . She 's not working tonight . Other girls , some of whom know him and some of whom would like to , come up . Dennis does n't look as though he is having a great time . He orders some food and sits there  --  girls stripping to his left and behind him  --  eating and watching the silent sports highlights on the screen in front of us . He is wearing a large , purple velvet hat . Another girl comes up . " Let me see your hair , " she says . He pulls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but otherwise pays her no notice whatsoever . She ruffles the hair ; he says nothing . <p> " Why do you come to these places ? " I ask him . <p> " I do n't get bothered so much , " he says . Then he adds , more precisely , " Guys do n't bother me so much . " <p> The DJ trumpets each new celebrity who arrives . Erik Estrada is apparently " in the house ! " Goran Ivanisevic , too . I do n't hear Dennis ' name . A girl in glasses and white bloomers  --  a customer , I think , and not one of the service providers  --  goes up to Dennis . She thinks he looks interesting . She seems not to recognize him . <p> " What do you do for a living ? " <p> " Sell computers , " he says . <p> She nods . " Can I just say , ' E-mail is bringing back the art of letter writing . ' I fucking hate the telephone . I wo n't answer the telephone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " How boring was that ? " says Dennis . <p> Dennis does n't let any of the girls dance for him until just before we leave , when he takes a previous acquaintance around the corner , into the shadows . He sits against the wall ; she leans into him . I can just see her top slip off . One song , two songs , three songs , four songs . . . <p> It 's the next week , in Nice , France , where Dennis Rodman has come to film a movie with Jean-Claude Van Damme , when we finally speak at length . I still ca n't get him to sit down at a quiet table and talk , but I follow him and follow him , and one day at Leaders Fitness Club , as he begins his afternoon workout , he indicates that the interview may begin . So I follow him from apparatus to apparatus , clutching tape recorder and notebook . We will do this for the next three days . <p> All the substantial conversations in this article occurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cycling or pumping in this gym . Maybe it 's just the comfort of routine and of familiarity . But it seems like something else  --  as if when he pumps away , it is a time when his exhaustion and effort rip away the censor and the shyness that protect him . As if only at the point of exhaustion is he free to say what he really wants to say . One time , resting between weights , he starts an answer and then tells me he 'd better not say what he was going to . Then when he begins to lift once more , the words he had decided to swallow come out anyway . <p> Dennis Rodman was brought up on smart , soft soul : the Spinners , the Four Tops , Gladys Knight and the Pips , Teddy Pendergrass . His first purchase was an Al Green 8-track . He still likes that music , but he thinks there have been advances . " The music that 's played today , " he says , " is not the same as the music as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on music because they speak what they really believe , not about what people want them to . " <p> One day in Detroit , when he first saw the video for " Alive " on MTV , he was transfixed . This was the music for him . " Boom ! " he explains . " There ai n't no reason why . Just because . Then you start to listen to the words , and I kinda felt some of the things they was talking about . Things I 've been telling you . Those things . " <p> One famous Detroit night in February 1993 , Dennis Rodman sat in the parking lot of the arena in which the Pistons play , music blaring from his pickup truck , cradling a rifle . It is the only time Dennis Rodman has seriously thought about killing himself . Eventually he fell asleep , and that was how the police , who had been looking for him because of a depressed note he had left at a friend 's house earlier in the night , found him . The music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ten . <p> " Just a coincidence , " he says at first , but then adds , " you got ' Alive , ' you got ' Jeremy , ' you got ' Black , ' you got all those songs like that . It makes you come to grips with what 's going on . Lucky for me it was Pearl Jam . " After that , Jeff Ament came to write an article about him for a basketball magazine . " Jeff traveled with me and the team for , like , a week , " he says . " Practiced with us . He was pretty damn good . " <p> Rodman met the whole band three years ago , in Seattle . " Eddie Vedder was more , like , to himself , " he remembers . Then last year , Jeff and Eddie came to most of the playoffs . Rodman got to know Eddie better . " We had a good vibe there between us two , " he says . <p> ME : What do you have in common ? <p> DENNIS RODMAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was young , and he really found himself within his music and what he believed in . And basically the same deal with me . We find each other very attractive , mentally . There 's more of a hypnotist between us two for some reason . We talk to each other , and it 's . . . boom ! <p> ME : Like you 're telepathic ? <p> DENNIS RODMAN : Yes . It 's somewhat like that . It 's like we understand each other without ever saying a word . <p> ME : What do you talk about ? <p> DENNIS RODMAN : Life in general . I ca n't really go into detail . He wants to create his own message . He does n't want to be exploited . He can not handle some of the things that go on , because he 's a pretty quiet and laid-back person . I 'm totally different  --  I can handle the situation , all the aggravation that 's offered , and I feed off that . He feeds off his own pain that he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , because he wants to be who I am , as far as . . . he wants to be more controlled as far as his celebrity status . My mind is very powerful and strong , and it works not to let anyone break me down . I think he 's very intrigued by that . It 's hard for him to jump from being nobody , and all of a sudden he ca n't go anywhere . Smiles He 's so small . <p> ME : You must look very odd together . <p> DENNIS RODMAN : We do . I 'm like Stan , and he 's Laurel . But for a small man , he has a powerful way of delivering his message . He said , " You know , sometimes I scare myself when I sing . " He hurts himself because he really feels what he believes and people understand that . <p> Dennis has maybe 50 Pearl Jam CDs , many of them bootlegs provided by the band . A message he left on a Pearl Jam answering machine was on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own record . He says that he and Pearl Jam have a deal : They get to choose the number he wears for the Bulls this season ; he gets a song written by them for him to sing . " Something fast , " he suggests , " so you ca n't hear me . " He says that he ca n't really sing , but sometimes he leaps onstage with bands in Las Vegas and belts out a KC and the Sunshine Band chorus or two . All this talking is making him think . He grabs his cell phone and  --  standing in the middle of a Nice gym  --  dials a number from memory and leaves a message : <p> " Hello , hello . . . Eddie V , Eddie V . . . this is the man from , er . . . where the fuck am I ? . . . this is the man from Nice calling to see what the hell 's going on . . . . I 'm coming to Maine for the show . . . . Hope that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . give me a call back , brother . " <p> He tries another number , begins leaving another message . " Red , black , yellow . . . red , black , yellow . . . " Some one picks up . " Who 's this ? . . . Jeff ? . . . What 's up , bro ? " Dennis Rodman wanders over to the gym window and talks to Jeff Ament for five minutes or so . <p> The quadrants of Dennis Rodman 's hair are colored purple , blue , yellow and green . His name is Yaz , he is a weapons specialist , and he is showing Jean-Claude Van Damme around the back room of his tattoo parlor , where he keeps the weapons . <p> I ask Rodman why he 's decided to act in movies . <p> " More money , " he says . " I do n't get paid enough money in the NBA , so I 've got to support my habit some other way . " <p> Which habit would that be ? <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habit , " he says . " I guess . Gambling habit . " <p> This is neither quite a joke nor quite the truth . Dennis tells me that his biggest win ever was $80,000 in a night ; his biggest loss , $100,000 over a weekend . " If it fits in our budget , fine , " says Dwight . " A lady buys dresses . Some people go on a trip . That 's his thing . If it 's less than 5 percent of what he makes , who cares ? " <p> " What makes you think you can act ? " I ask Rodman . <p> " I ca n't , " Rodman says . " 90 percent of the people that 's acting now that are actors and actresses ca n't act . " <p> The film is called The Colony . The plot is a complicated but fairly snappy affair that offers a clever spin on some of the usual action themes : secret agents , revenge , final missions , long-buried secrets . It stars Jean-Claude Van Damme ( as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the baddie ) and Rodman ( as a maverick helping hand ) . They are filming in a crumbling promenade next to the Nice harbor , which has been re-created as a bustling street of sex shops and strange characters . Jean-Claude Van Damme comes over to me to talk . He gestures toward Dennis . " You think he is crazy ? " he asks . He stares meaningfully . " I think he is crazy like a fox . You know what I mean ? " <p> Jean-Claude had n't heard of Dennis Rodman , but one of his sons is a big fan . And Van Damme 's happy with what he 's seeing : " He 's good for a beginner . He 's got charisma , which you can not buy . Even if you look tough and crazy , he 's got that . . . like a child . He 's got that child . Which I have , too , I guess . It 's a good marriage . " <p> We talk about the way Rodman looks , and what it might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I believe he 's missing affection , " Van Damme says . " I believe he 's got all those people around him who do n't really care about his inside . Maybe I 'm wrong . But I believe he should almost have a person like a priest . Like a pastor . He should be in a village somewhere where they have a church and an old man who really cares . I think he built such protection , it 's very difficult to penetrate it . I read in the paper about his father , and I told Dennis  --  I have no right to say so because I do n't know his private life  --  I do n't care if my father is crazy , I want to talk to him . You 've got to face your hurt . Even if you have to bleed for it . " <p> As is traditional on film sets throughout cinematic history , the stars spend most of their hours sitting and waiting . <p> " What are we out here for ? " Dennis asks . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ball on . " <p> A woman arrives the next day . Her name is Erika . She is from California , in her mid-20s , friendly and quite beautiful . Her exact place in the scheme of things . . . well , it is no more simple than many of the things drawn into the orbit of Planet Rodman . <p> This is the scene in Dennis Rodman 's trailer the following night . Erika reads Cry Wolf , by Tami Hoag ( cover blurb : The scream heard by no one is the deadliest ) . Dwight does the New York Times crossword puzzle . Rob , the undercover cop , reads Marine Sniper , by Charles Henderson ( 93 confirmed kills ) . Dennis practices his lines , listens to Metallica 's Metallica and has his nails done . I ask Dennis what 's the last book he read . " Wrote ? " he replies , eyes smiling . " Or read ? " ( In fact , he has a book of Henry Rollins ' poetry back at the hotel . ) Erika changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got ta be kidding , " Rodman says . " This is so old . " ( It 's the way it is : The white California girl wants rap ; the black basketball eccentric wants moody rock . ) <p> A few hours later , I walk back to Dennis ' trailer . Erika and Dennis are inside . Dwight and I linger outside , unsure whether this is a good time to enter . Maybe he 's put on Alice in Chains . ( " The sexiest rock &; roll band , " he has told me . " It just makes you want to go and fuck . To this you could have sex when you 're dead . " ) <p> " Do you fish ? " Dwight asks me . <p> He touches the side of the caravan with a fingertip . A careful angler checking his line . Feeling for vibrations . Working out whether Dennis and Erika are at it . <p> " A few nibbles , " he diagnoses , " but we have n't caught the big one yet . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets on the cell phone to America . I ca n't help hearing . He arranges for a beer keg to be changed in California . Oh , and something else . <p> " . . . And when those two other wires come in , give Dennis a check for a million dollars . " <p> When I first broach the subject , Dennis Rodman shies away from talking about the shifting sands of his sexuality . You 've got to save something for yourself . <p> " That 's gon na come out in my next book , " he explains matter-of-factly . <p> But he relents . " I think you have to figure out why you want to do it , and if you do it , are you gon na be happy . Me , if I ever decide to convert to being bisexual or gay , it has to be clear in my head that my body will accept the dangers , the risk , the losses I might have in my life at that time . " In Bad as I Wan na Be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought he was going to be gay ; he talks about hanging out in gay bars ; he says : " Maybe I am bisexual , but if I am it 's in my mind only . . . . I fantasize about being with another man , and I 'm not afraid to admit it . " <p> At first , he tells me that he has never kissed a man . We talk about this a little , and then he blurts out a slight revision . " I 've kissed a transsexual , " he says . It turns out that in the last two years , Dennis has kissed both a male transsexual who was yet to lose his male genitalia  --  his name is Mimi ; he lives in Chicago  --  and also a male transvestite . <p> ME : Well , those are men ! <p> DENNIS RODMAN : I think the visualization of seeing a man looking like a woman is still saying : You are with a woman , but that 's a man here . Indicates the groin area I think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the way they present themselves . The elegance . Their aura . They 're not afraid to be free and to express that , and I like people who are free and love to express their . . . what people are scared of . <p> ME : Where were you the first time ? <p> DENNIS RODMAN : Dallas , Texas . I was in a gay bar . I 've probably known these people for a long time . It was more like , hey , yeah , a kiss , and we 're still friends . <p> ME : What did that first kiss feel like ? <p> DENNIS RODMAN : It felt like kissing a woman . But I knew it was a man . It was a safe environment for me because it was , like , the best of both worlds . It 's like you 're kissing a woman , but you know it 's a man deep down . The more you do it , the more it 's that . . . that color-of-chocolate candy stuff covers your body . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice feeling from kissing ? <p> DENNIS RODMAN : Yeah . Hell , I was put on this earth to make everyone equal . <p> ME : How far did you go ? Did you rummage around ? <p> DENNIS RODMAN : Oh , no , no . He had boobs and things like that  --  you feel  --  but as far as . . . you know what 's going on . She  --  I called her she . Then I 've kissed this one in Chicago . . . . She is due in the hospital this very week for the next stage of her transformation . Castration . <p> One night on the film set : <p> DENNIS RODMAN : Mimi 's having her balls cut off this week . <p> DWIGHT : I know you . You 'll get drunk and do Mimi one night . <p> Dennis had his scrotum pierced a while back , but he got kicked playing basketball , so he 's put off any more piercing until he 's retired . Then he 'll get his penis done , too . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's kind of like saying you 're inviting yourself to feel an electricity that you can never feel in your life . " <p> Everyone wants something . And , so malleable is Dennis Rodman 's crazy , freaky , showman , **26;2527;TOOLONG celebrity that they all think they can take it as it suits them . This summer he was surprised to find his name invoked at the highest levels . The buttons came first  --  the first lady with cropped , dyed hair , her name mutated  --  and then she endorsed the joke by referring to herself at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago as Hillary Rodman Clinton . " I think she should have come sleep with me . Let me have sex with her first , " he says , " before she saying my name . " <p> ME : You fancy her ? <p> DENNIS RODMAN : Oh , no . I just think she should have sex with me before using my name . But I do n't think I 'd ever want to sleep with her . Just because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the rules and regulations , how to make me come ! " <p> ME : Why do you think she 'd be like that ? <p> DENNIS RODMAN : She 's so strong . She try to be so hard and vicious and attacking whenever she talks . And I 'll be saying , " No , no , no , this is the way I want it to happen . " Laughs You must be really important if they start making up shit like that . This country 's really fucked up , ai n't it ? I think the first lady should just dye her whole hair green or red or something . Really trip everybody out . <p> Dennis Rodman is not a voter . " I vote in my head . I vote me as president . " <p> Every night Dennis tells me to call his hotel room the next day , and we 'll make plans . We part at 7:30 in the morning ( they are shooting nights ) as daylight edges over the Mediterranean , and he says to call him at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rodman up . <p> Today I call at 12:30 . A comatose Dennis answers . " Still laying down , " he grunts . " Call me in an hour . " <p> I call at 1:30 . Fewer words , same message . <p> I call at 2:30 . The phone just rings . I call back . After about eight rings , the receiver is picked up , but no one answers . I wait . I can hear the sound of distant grunge . I can hear Dennis . I can hear Erika . I wait . And wait . And then I decide I have heard enough . <p> That night on the set , I sit with Erika in Dennis ' trailer , playing the card games her grandmother taught her . I ask her how long she has known Dennis , and she says , " We had our one-year anniversary in August . . . . " Heaven knows how she imagines their relationship ; heaven knows what it is . She tells me about his strange music taste  --  about how he still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Def Leppard  --  and about the time he threw her Presidents of the United States of America tape out of the car window , declaring , " I have no need for this . " <p> She tells me that last spring in Chicago , the Bulls wanted Dennis to see a therapist after he head-butted a referee . When Dennis complied , he took Erika , too . Dennis refused to speak , so Erika did all the talking : " No , I do n't think he 'll head-butt anyone again . " Rodman 's chosen venue for this therapeutic encounter : Taco Bell . <p> We play more cards . She mentions that Eddie Vedder does good card tricks . Eh ? It turns out that they were all on vacation in Hawaii . " Dennis wants to be Eddie , " she says . And vice versa . " Eddie painted his fingernails white . Dennis said , ' Where did you get that ? ' " Likewise , Dennis has been wearing a rubber band around his left hand because Eddie does that . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' Are you going to go swimming ? ' " Erika says . They had a motorbike . Erika and Eddie were both too small to ride it , so they took rides with Dennis . " He wanted me to ride , " Erika says , " but he really wanted to be with Eddie . " She laughs . " I said to Eddie , ' I 've done fights , had sex , eaten to your music . ' " She says that Dennis really does play Pearl Jam the whole time : " He 'll take the music and explain it to me , and relate it to Alexis . " <p> Alexis is Dennis Rodman 's daughter . She is 8 . " I do n't like talking about it , " he says . " It 's too emotional . " He tells me this : " I 'm very vulnerable in certain areas , but people do n't need to see that from Dennis Rodman . Toward me and my little girl . I 'm human , just like anybody else . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't nothing I can do about it . I spent too much money to get nothing , so I 'm gon na wait time pass by till my child say she wants to be with her father . . . . I did n't desert her . I did n't leave her . It was the other way around . I was n't the one to not keep in contact . " <p> Two weeks ago , he says , he made his first-ever will . " I left most of my money to her , " he says . The last time he cried , about a month ago , was the last time he spoke to her . But she 's with him always . <p> He got his first tattoo in the late ' 80s . " You gon na ask which one it was ? It was on my back , of my daughter . Just about all my tattoos are about my daughter except for the naked girl and the motorcycle . Everything else is about my daughter . " When he sees her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tattoo of me when I was a baby ? " " I say , ' Yep ! ' And she always grasps my arm and turns it . " <p> I spend hours and hours , days and days , around Dennis Rodman . Around , but not with , him . He has a huge capacity for shutting out the world . The person you meet when he 's in a crowd of people is not the person who talks in this interview or who grandstands and heart-bleeds through Bad as I Wan na Be . Though his clothes and his nails and his tattoos and his hair may suggest another story , he does not act the extrovert . And he does not try to impress . When no one is around , the sharpness and silliness let rip . When everyone is around , Dennis Rodman is as dumb as he wants to be . <p> ME : When do you feel most alone ? <p> DENNIS RODMAN : When I 'm suffocated around a lot of people . <p> ME : The more people , the less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just get lost in the fact that this is not really me . I think a lot of people in my position , it 's like that . <p> ME : I 've been watching . You play dumb quite a lot . <p> DENNIS RODMAN : Finds this very funny I know . Triumphantly You see , people think I 'm just stupid and dumb and wacky . People are , " Is he really that dumb ? Is he really that stupid ? " I know what 's going on . I know exactly what 's going on all the time . I have to keep that two-way mirror . <p> ME : How smart do you think you are ? <p> DENNIS RODMAN : Street-smart ? Very . Book smart ? Dumb . . . as . . . a . . . post . <p> ME : But clever ? <p> DENNIS RODMAN : Very clever . <p> Some personal philosophy and thoughts on happiness : <p> ME : When are you most happy ? <p> DENNIS RODMAN : When am I most happy ? Pauses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come back to that one . <p> ME : Well , that 's its own answer . <p> DENNIS RODMAN : It 's hard for me to answer that question . For some reason I have no time to get happy . I think when I 'm most happiest is when I 'm actually so tense , so angry , so mad and disgusted , and I can relieve all that and be happy . I imagine life as one big . . . Stops , shakes his head <p> ME : What ? <p> DENNIS RODMAN : Laughs I 'm not going to say that . <p> ME : Say what ? <p> DENNIS RODMAN : Pauses I imagine life is one big piece of pussy , and I 'm fucking it , and all of a sudden I come . And I 'm happy because I 've fucked it . <p> ME : So when do you feel that you 've done that ? <p> DENNIS RODMAN : It comes and goes . When I 'm thinking about everything that 's happened to me and all of the intangibles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go through . . . and I have to masturbate and get off on it . I feel that everything is just totally whooshed away from my body , and I 'm more happy , at peace . <p> ME : Slowly cottoning on When you say masturbate , you mean mentally ? <p> DENNIS RODMAN : Physically . <p> ME : Actually masturbate ? <p> DENNIS RODMAN : Yeah . After that , my mind 's at ease . My mind 's cleared . There 's a tropical forest with sunshine . Everything is totally perfect for the first five , 10 minutes after it happens . <p> ME : So how often do you do that in that kind of way ? <p> DENNIS RODMAN : I do it a lot . Holds up his two hands That 's why I call them Monique and Judy . So I 've always got two girls all the time . One is quicker than the other , but that 's about it . Monique . Monique had a broken finger Shows his kinked right little finger , so she kinda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So Judy stepped in ? <p> DENNIS RODMAN : Judy had no choice . It was her time . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Dennis Rodman with the world in his mouth . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : A side view of Dennis Rodman unclothed . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Rodman 's pierced navel . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Profile of Dennis Rodman <p> By Chris Heath <p>
