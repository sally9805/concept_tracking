It was shortly after noon when Detective Inspector Isabelle Ardery first saw Celandine Cottage . The sun was high in the sky , casting small pools of shadow at the base of the fir trees that lined the drive . This had been sealed off with yellow police tape . One panda car , a red Sierra , and a blue and white milk-float were lined up on the lane . She parked behind the milk-float and surveyed the area , feeling grim despite her initial pleasure at being called out on another case so soon . For information gathering , the location did n't look promising . There were several houses farther along the lane , timber-framed with peg-tiled roofs like the cottage in which the fire had occurred , but they were each surrounded with enough land to give them quiet and privacy . So if the fire in question turned out to be arson -- as was suggested by the words questionable ignition scrawled at the bottom of the note Ardery had received from her chief constable not an hour ago -- it might prove unlikely that any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With her collection kit in hand , she ducked under the tape and swung open the gate at the end of the drive . Across a paddock to the east where a bay mare was grazing , half a dozen onlookers leaned against a split chestnut fence . She could hear their murmured speculation as she walked up the drive . Yes , indeed , she told them mentally as she passed through a smaller gate into the garden , a woman investigator , even for a fire . Welcome to the waning years of our century . " Inspector Ardery ? " It was a female voice . Isabelle turned to see another woman waiting on the brick path that led in two directions : to the frontdoor and round towards the back of the house . She 'd apparently come from this latter direction . " DS Coffman , " she said cheerfully . " Greater Springburn CID . " Isabelle joined her . She offered her hand . Coffman said , " The guv 's not here at the moment . He rode with the body to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greater Springburn 's chief superintendent had been the one to request her presence in the first place . It was a breach of police etiquette for him to leave the site before her arrival . " The hospital ? " she asked . " Have you no medical examiner to accompany the body ? " Coffman gave her eyes a quick rise heavenward . " Oh , he was here as well , graciously assuring us that the corpse was dead . But there 's to be a news conference when they i.d . the victim , and the guv loves that stuff . Give him a microphone , five minutes of your time , and he does a fairly decent John Thaw . " " Who 's still here , then ? " " Couple of probationary DCs getting their first chance to suss things out . And the bloke who discovered the mess . Snell , he 's called . " " What about the fire brigade ? " " They 've been and gone . Snell phoned emergency from next door , house across from the spring . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Coffman smiled . " Luck for your side . Once they got in , they could see the fire 'd been out for hours . They did n't touch a thing . They just phoned CID and waited till we got here . " That fact , at least , was a blessing . One of the biggest difficulties in arson investigation was the necessary existence of the fire brigade . They were trained to two tasks : saving lives and extinguishing fires . Intent upon that , more often than not they axed down doors , flooded rooms , collapsed ceilings , and in the process obliterated evidence . Isabelle ran her gaze over the building . She said , " All right . I 'll take a moment out here , first . " " Shall I  --  " " Alone , please . " Coffman said , " Quite . I 'll leave you to it , " and strode off towards the back of the house . She paused at the northeast corner of the building , turning back and pushing a curl of oak-coloured hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this way when you 're ready , " she said . She began to raise an index finger in comradely salute , apparently thought better of it , and disappeared round the side of the house . Isabelle stepped off the brick path and crossed the lawn , walking to the far corner of the property . There she turned back and gazed first at the cottage and then at the grounds that surrounded it . If arson had been committed here , finding evidence outside the building was n't going to be easy . It would take hours to conduct a search on the grounds because Celandine Cottage was an amateur gardener 's dream : hung on the south end by wisteria just coming into bloom , surrounded by flower beds from which grew everything from forget-me-nots to heather , from white violets to lavender , from pansies to tulips . Where there were n't flower-beds , there was lawn , thick and lush . Where there was n't lawn , there were shrubs in bloom . Where there were n't shrubs , there were trees . These lastprovided a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbour . If there were footprints , tyre prints , discarded tools , fuel containers , or matchbooks , it was going to take some effort to find them . Isabelle circled the house carefully , moving east to northwest . She examined windows . She scanned the ground . She gave her attention to roof and to doors . In the end , she made her way to the back where the kitchen door stood open and where , under an arbour across which a grapevine was beginning to unfurl its leaves , a middle-aged man sat at a wicker table , with his head sunk into his chest and his hands pressed together between his knees . A glass of water stood , untouched , before him . " Mr. Snell ? " The man lifted his head . " Took the body , they did , " he said . " She was covered up all from head to toe . She was wrapped up and tied down . It looked like they 'd put her in some sort of bag . It 's not proper , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's not even respectful . " Isabelle joined him , pulling out a chair and setting her collection kit on the concrete . She felt an instant 's duty to comfort him , but making an effort at compassion seemed pointless . Dead was dead no matter what anyone said or did . Nothing changed that fact for the living . " Mr. Snell , were the doors locked or unlocked when you arrived ? " " I tried to get in when she did n't answer . But I could n't . So I looked in the window . " He squeezed his hands together and took a tremulous breath . " She would n't have suffered , would she ? I heard one of them say the body was n't even burnt and that 's why they could tell who it was straightaway . Did she die from the smoke , then ? " " We wo n't know anything for certain until a postmortem is done , " DS Coffman said . She 'd come to the doorway . Her answer sounded professionally cautious . The man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about them kittens ? " " Kittens ? " Isabelle asked . " Miss Gabriella 's kittens . Where 're they ? No one 's brought them out . " Coffman said , " They must be outside somewhere . We 've not run across them in the house . " " But she got herself two little ' uns last week . Two kittens . From over by the spring . Someone 'd dumped them in a cardboard box next to the footpath . She brought them home . She was caring for them . They slept in the kitchen in their own little basket and --  " Snell wiped the back of his wrist against his eyes . " I got to see to the milk delivery . Before it goes bad . " " Have you got his statement ? " Isabelle asked Coffman as she ducked beneath the low lintel of the doorway to join the DS in the kitchen . " For what it 's worth . Thought you might want to have a chat with him yourself . Shall I send him off ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'll see to it . We 're in through there . " Coffman gestured towards an inner door . Beyond it , Isabelle could see the curve of a dining table and the end of a wall-sized fireplace . " Who 's been inside ? " " Three blokes from the fire brigade . The CID lot . " " Crime team ? " " Just the photographer and the pathologist . I thought it best to keep the rest out till you had a look .
