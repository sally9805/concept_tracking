When light came enough that the sky was blue , Ivy and Track had been driving for an hour already , the three girls and Tad in the back and Bella-Jean smug between them in the front seat , holding a paper bag to throw up in if she had to . Buzzy , the baby , lolled on Ivy 's lap heavily ; the car had put him to sleep . Track drove with an abstracted air , his eyes narrowed against the light reflecting back from the highway . His strong left arm was a reddish brown where it rested against the rolled-down window . <p> " Georgia , " he sang with a kind of deep abandon , in his scratchy voice . " Geor-gia . . . " He sang to keep himself awake , half the time with no words at all . They were in Tennessee still , but tonight they would be in Georgia , the next in the string of moves that made up a sergeant 's life . Ivy thought of what she had heard about Fort Benning : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range of quarters they drew . She had been lucky so far ; they could have sent him to Korea . <p> Track reached across Bella-Jean and squeezed Ivy 's shoulder through her thin dress . <p> " Sleepy ? " he said to her , interrupting his song and winking at her . He passed his hand up toward her neck , where her hair was already damp from the heat , but stopped after he had squeezed it once and went back to the wheel . She turned on the seat so she could see the four in the back , each of them sitting on a different color pillowcase packed with their clothes . <p> From the seat behind her , Tad was kicking her in the spine , little jarring knocks with the new cowboy boots she had bought him at the post thrift store for two seventy-five . As he kicked , the clothes beneath him began to work their way out of the pillowcase onto the seat , headed for the floor . Tad was the oldest boy , named Oscar Traxton after Track ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ivy put her arm back over the seat and smoothed back his cowlick . <p> " You leave off kicking me with those fancy boots , " she said to him . " You 're gon ' wear them out . " <p> When she said the word " boots " Track switched his tune again , moving out of a growling , halfway hum . " There was blood upon the risers , there were brains upon the chutes , " he sang loud to the Battle Hymn of the Republic , hitting the steering wheel . <p> " Track , " Ivy said , wishing he would stop . But he was n't looking at her , was n't thinking about anything but the road . She admired the way he could shut out the noise , knew it was what kept him coming home to her all these years . <p> The kids had joined in . " The intestines were a-dangling from his paratrooper boots ! " They loved it that their father jumped out of airplanes , the silk billowing over his head like he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground hard . He had taught them all how to do it ; they jumped from the back of the couch and rolled on the floor , curled up so that thigh , butt , arm , and shoulder took the shock . Every time he had a jump they would do it all day long , while Ivy mixed up a cake and waited for the sound of his heavy boots on the steps outside . <p> " Are you satisfied , " she said mildly to him across the front seat . They would be singing it into her grave , she was sure . But he did n't mind , gave a smile without looking at her . <p> " When are we going to stop ? " Callie asked . She was lying down on the rear-window shelf , which was a tight fit . Her cheek was pressed against its dirty felt and her dress was twisted up around her waist . No one answered . <p> " Next year  --  next year , " Track sang , syncopated , " somethin 's bound to happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned around while the car went too fast down the straight road and he fixed his fierce look on the children . " Someone got to go again ? " <p> " He does , " said Annie , pointing at Tad , who was still making jittery bounces on the seat . " I can tell . I have to sit next to him . " She held her nose . <p> The jolt when the car stopped on the shoulder of the road made Callie fall off the window shelf onto the rest of them . " Everybody out ! " Track shouted , flinging open the door . They got out into the hot air that seemed suddenly still and queer . Ivy mixed peanut butter and jelly together in a big jar on the flat trunk lid . She took out hamburger buns from a plastic bag and spread the mixture onto the soft bread , counting out one for everybody except Buzzy . He sat unsteadily on the hot trunk , reaching for the jar and for the knife as it flashed in her hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the piney scrub along its edge . Track walked at a slow pace among them , his loose stride breaking now and then as he stretched first one leg and then the other out in a forced airborne kick . He had got a fresh haircut the day before , and she could see the familiar bony shine of his skull . <p> She did not hear the boy coming up behind her ; what made her turn around was Buzzy 's fixed , attentive scowl at something past her . The boy looked older than any of hers , about twelve , with black hair and one shoulder that slanted lower than the other . He carried a paper bag , worn thin as cloth where it had been rolled down so he could hold it shut . <p> " You goin ' on down this road ? " he said to Ivy . He spoke right up but he looked at Buzzy rather than directly at her . He was not as bold as he seemed . She could feel him watching as she closed up the buns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had washed out four times last night and filled with water . Her own children were returning to her now ; they stared at the stranger talking to their mother and waited to see if she would send him off . <p> Ivy handed out the hamburger buns , leaving out two for her and Track . She held the bleach bottle to the lips of each of the children , steadying it as the warm water sloshed heavily against its sides . All this time the boy watched her sideways . He crooked a dirty finger at Buzzy , moved it back and forth so that the baby stared , fascinated . <p> Track was back then , his hand steady on her shoulder and sliding quickly down her arm before he reached for his lunch . " Who 's this ? " he said to the extra boy . <p> " Sir , " the boy said , letting his hand fall from Buzzy 's gaze . He started to say more but his voice caught in his throat and he coughed and looked away . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched Track heft the bottle and drink , the water going down his sunburned throat . Even in his short-sleeved shirt and old work pants he looked like a soldier , and she knew the boy had been suddenly afraid to ask . It would be foolish to give him a ride ; there would be five in the back , then . <p> " We got a full car , " Track said . He wiped water from his lip , took one of the buns and started on it . " Where you going , boy ? " <p> The boy drew himself up . " Litchie , " he said . " I 'm going to help out my auntie in Litchie . " <p> Ivy could see the other children getting restless , Annie and Helena whispering and pulling at Callie to get her to come with them . <p> " You all make sure none of you has to go , " she said . " Then get on back in the car . Did you hear what I said , Bella-Jean ? " <p> She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wiped their faces one by one , moving among them with Buzzy holding on at her hip . When she looked back , she saw that the boy was still standing and waiting by the car , though Track had turned away from him and leaned against the hot green fender with his eyes shut against the glare . <p> While she watched he opened his eyes and barely turned his head in their direction . <p> " I guess we can swing by Litchie , " she heard him say . <p> In the back seat , the children grabbed their places , pushing their bulging pillowcases into the cracks and under their knees and feet . None of them wanted to sit next to the boy ; he ended up jammed against Tad in the middle , with Annie on his other side looking scared , her thumb in her mouth though she was eight years old . Cranston , he had said his name was when Tad asked , and Ivy heard the bravado in his voice . <p> " See that line ? " Tad showed Cranston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the seat . " You stay on your side . " He had to hold his pillowcase in his lap to make room , and he hunched forward over it . <p> Track counted them aloud and added one . Then he pulled the gearshift toward him and up with a grinding sound . They lurched onto the highway and against each other , Buzzy staring over Ivy 's shoulder toward the back , his mouth open on the diaper she 'd put over her dress . <p> " In my solitude  --  " Track started right up , and Ivy looked at him wondering if he meant the joke , but he was already absent , humming vaguely . He was just as likely to put in anything when he forgot the words , their whole life history coming right out to the tune of an old hit song . " Be boo , be-be boo , " he sang . " I know that I 'll soon go mad  --  " and then he interrupted himself . " Give me a look at that map , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were rolled down in the car , but it was still hot . Ivy could see Callie sweating where she lay on the back shelf , her face humid and flushed . Tad and Cranston began to poke at each other . <p> " Bet you 're eleven , " said Tad . " Helena 's eleven . " Tad was ten and short for his age . <p> " Thirteen , " said the boy . Tad did n't believe him ; he started to tickle Cranston . " I can get you down , " he teased , linking his arm through the boy 's and trying to get him flat on the seat . " Let 's play Luxury , " he said to the rest of them . <p> Helena hung her hair out the window and let it blow , ignoring them . She was the oldest and ought to have been in the front by rights , but Bella-Jean had cried and said she was going to be sick again . <p> " Get his feet , Annie , " Tad said . Annie held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than usual . " Do you want me to sit on them ? " she said , panting . Ivy let them wrestle it out , trying to pay no mind . She thought of how it would be in Georgia , whether the commissary and the schools would be close enough to walk . <p> As Cranston pinned Tad to the seat , Callie rolled purposely onto both of them from the shelf . She sprawled on the boy 's thin back and groaned , her tongue hanging out . " Luxury , " she moaned in exaggerated pleasure , Cranston writhing weirdly beneath her . " Lux-ury ! " <p> The commotion broke through Track 's song and he thrust his fist behind him without looking around . " I 'll show you luxury , " he threatened . <p> Ivy reached back wearily to straighten Callie 's dress . " How many times do I have to say , " she said . <p> The boy straightened up , dumping Callie down by the drive-shaft hump on the floor . Ivy heard the rip of comic books as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stink of sneakers and stale peanut butter . Anything clean on these kids was a lost cause now . <p> " You would n't have won if you played fair , " he said . <p> " You do n't even know the rules , " said Callie . There was an aggressive pout to her voice , like she was spoiling for a sickness . <p> Ivy 's own head began to ache with the heat and the quarrel . <p> Cranston looked at the child with contempt . " The one on top says luxury , " he said . " You think I do n't know what that means ? " He had a long scrape across his elbow and his teeth were set far apart . Callie twisted away so that she was hanging over the front seat . <p> " How long until he gets out ? " she said , too loud . <p> Ivy put the back of her hand on the child 's cheek and felt it for fever . " Hush up , " she whispered . " Not too long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , " Track said conversationally . He flipped the map with one hand ; it fell open another fold onto Bella-Jean , who was picking a knee scab till it bled . " I was in Litchie once , a long time ago . Looking for work . Bottling plant there , is n't that so ? " he asked the boy over his shoulder . <p> " Before you joined the Army ? " Tad said . They all loved to hear Track 's stories . Ivy suspected that half of them were made up , anyway , making Track out to be a wild and dangerous boy , not knowing what he was going to do , no work for anybody . In the Army he had met up with Ivy , who had a job in the Woolworth 's off post . " I met my million-dollar baby , " he sang whenever he told them about it . <p> She took the map when he handed it back to her and saw where Litchie was , another hundred miles at least , and fifty of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could have gone straight on the main highway . In the back , Annie began to cry ; when Callie climbed back on the shelf she had stepped on her leg and ripped the waist of her dress . <p> " That 's enough back there , " Ivy said . " Stop the car , " she said to Track . " He 's going to have to find his own way , I guess . " <p> Track appeared not to hear her , his eyes straight ahead against the sun . <p> " I did n't do anything , " the boy said . He was defiant and cold , on the dangerous edge of youth ; he knew more than any of her children did yet . " They was just playing their game . " <p> " Track , " Ivy said , reaching across Bella-Jean to put her hand squarely on his driving arm . " We got too many in this car to take this boy along . We need to let him out . " <p> He glanced at her sharply . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it was a sergeant 's voice . " You men shape up back there , " he said . " We got two hours to drive before we 're stopping , and I do n't care how bad you got to go . Where 'd you say you were going in Litchie , anyway , boy ? " <p> " My aunt has a diner , " Cranston said , triumphant . <p> " Track , " said Ivy , low and urgent . " We got too many kids back there . " <p> He looked at her then , and she wondered what was spoiling behind his gaze , flat now in a way she knew to leave alone . " I would n't mind swinging by Litchie , " he said . " Been a long time since I 've seen that old place . " He was like a stubborn boy himself , she saw , and bit her lip against her anger . He was already singing again , some song she could not even identify . <p> Ivy shut her eyes against the fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were on the outskirts of Litchie , its business district hunched a mile or two away in a dim brown haze . They would have to stop for the night down here , but she did n't want to go into town-paying good money to listen to street ruckus all night . Better one of those roadside places where for a couple of dollars extra all the kids could stay in the same room , on the floor . She would open the big jars of baby food and stand the children in line , spooning it out with one spoon . On her tongue she could already taste the furry texture of junior lamb , the smooth , watery strained peas , bliss of apricots from the last jar . <p> The sun was coming straight in the rear window onto the lot of them . Annie was asleep and Helena was reading again , giving herself a headache so she could sit in the front . Since they had passed the big lake an hour before , the boy Cranston had been watching for the turnoff he wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had the rough odor of adolescence , not like the dean dirt smell of the younger ones . <p> " Here it is , " said Cranston suddenly . <p> It was gleaming in the late sun , a silver box of low trailer on the side of the road . Windows went all the way across the front , and there were cement steps up to the door . BITE-N-BIDE , said the plastic sign that faced the road . ENJOY COCA-COLA . A stand of pine out back circled three tar-paper cabins . Track pulled the Plymouth into the dirt parking lot and turned it off . On the back shelf , Callie raised her head up suddenly from sleep , bumping it on the sloping glass . <p> " Do n't mind if I do , " said Track , letting a big yawn burst out of him and stretching his arms up over his head . Cranston was teetering anxiously on the floor hump , waiting to be let out . Ivy took her hair and pinned it again at the top of her head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her neck . <p> The boy rushed ahead of them into the diner , letting the door slam . " I 'll be a minute , " Track said to Ivy , nodding across the road to the privacy of some trees . <p> When she went in with Buzzy over her shoulder , the five children were already sitting at the counter on high stools , swiveling them with the wildness of being let out at last . It was n't a bad place , the menu in crooked block letters stuck up over the grill . A piano was jammed across one end of the trailer , with brown keys like bad teeth here and there . Cranston spun away from his aunt as soon as he saw Ivy come in , and turned his back to them on the piano stool , fooling around with his left hand . In the moment she saw his face , she wondered what he had told the aunt already . <p> Without asking , the woman put a glass of cold Coke in front of each of them , six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same black hair as Cranston and his sharp , knowing face . <p> " Oh , " said Ivy doubtfully . <p> " It 's on the house , " the aunt said . " Giving the boy a ride all the way ! " <p> Ivy felt the cold , bright shocks of the drink as she swallowed and the stiff tiredness of her neck and back . In the corner she could hear Cranston playing , something she 'd heard before , and she thought briefly it must be one of Track 's songs . The boy was good ; he made the fast notes move , stumbling only a little here and there . <p> " You driving this family yourself ? " the aunt said admiringly . Ivy laughed and settled herself on the seat , giving Buzzy a piece of ice to play with . <p> " I would n't do any of this without my man making me , " she said , tossing her hair back from where Buzzy had pulled it out of the pins and inclining her head toward the parking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We started maybe six this morning from West Tennessee . " <p> " You might could stay here tonight , " the aunt said . She jerked a thumb toward the back of the diner . " We got an empty cabin I could let the lot of you stay in for ten dollars . " " Sounds good to me , " Ivy said . The aunt was taking blistered pink hot dogs off a spiked rack that turned inside a hot glass case . She put each hot dog in a roll and then onto a thick china plate , and on the side , she put a pile of chips and a pickle . " Dogs <p> included , " she said , " for you . " Starting with Callie at the end , she served them each a plate , one after another from a stack on her arm . <p> Ivy was embarrassed . " Now do n't you go giving us food , " she said . " We got food in the car . " She saw the children eating fast without looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have given them , easy and so much cheaper . <p> From some prickle of attention on the aunt 's part , Ivy perceived that Track had come in , had in fact been standing for some while behind her in the door , watching the boy play . " I got it bad and that ai n't good , " popped without warning into Ivy 's head as he sat down next to her finally ; that 's what the tune was . She moved herself imperceptibly sideways on the stool so that her leg and arm touched Track 's . The day was almost over , anyway . <p> " This whole crowd of kids belong to you ? " the aunt said to Track , giving him a cup of coffee . He put his finger into the saucer and moved it a little to the music , his head cocked . The aunt leaned back against the sink and folded her arms as if she had nothing particular to do . " That one does , " she added , nodding at Tad . " Plain as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Ivy for Track , turning her stool around in a quick twirl and putting her hand on his leg . " I can swear that he is responsible . " She looked into Buzzy 's diaper and shook her head . " Track , " she said , brisk and quiet , half turning so she would n't be heard . " She 's got those cabins out back , all of us for ten dollars . " <p> Track just sat as if he did n't hear her , looking out the windows at the parking lot , his elbow resting on the counter . " She already treated us to those franks , " Ivy whispered . <p> All the children but Cranston had vanished into the lot , their plates littered with pickle and bits of chip . The aunt collected the dishes and began washing them up , her back to them . " I got work to do , " she said in the boy 's direction . He stopped right in the middle of the tune and pulled back the old stool with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see if she was going to tell him to do something , and then he gave Ivy a cocky look and darted out the door . <p> " Plenty of work around here these days ? " Track asked . He finished his coffee and the woman poured him some more . <p> " Some , " she said . She shrugged . " Construction , mostly . " She looked out the window at the children shrieking in the pink dust . " I got to have me another cabin built , for instance . " <p> Ivy could feel Track 's attention fix on the aunt . She looked at her again ; she was n't pretty enough for him to be interested . Two black wings of eyebrows grew too close together in the middle , giving her an odd scowl , like the boy 's . <p> He laughed in a queer , dry way . " I could have used some of that the last time I was here . " <p> The aunt glanced at Ivy . " Y'all did n't say you was here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind of interest Ivy had come to hate in these years of Army life . They all thought you had it good , the people who had to live in these towns full time . They wanted to leave and they could n't , pinned down by mothers and uncles and jobs and places they had saved for years to put a down payment on . When they saw you come into their stores , they knew they needed you but they hated you , anyway , for getting to move on , to see what would always be hidden from their eyes . What did they know about what it was really like , a world with troubles just as hard as theirs , everywhere people trying to ward them off one moment at a time ? What would Track care to hide , anyway ? Ivy hitched her dress up a little and put Buzzy on her bare knee , bouncing him to a tuneless rhyme under her breath as if she was n't listening . <p> " I lived on Genessee Avenue , " said Track . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over his upper lip , tightened against his teeth . She was aware of the heat of his body making damp patches on his cotton shirt . <p> " Fay Ann 's store ? " the aunt said , and Track grunted assent . Ivy could tell the woman was surprised that Track would know someone she knew by name . <p> He took a couple of sugar cubes from the metal bowl and lowered them very slowly into his coffee . Then he looked at Ivy . She stood up at once and lifted Buzzy away from her . " You are a mess , " she said , and laid him down on the floor . " I do n't know what I am going to do with you ! " Before he could object , she had his diaper halfway off . <p> " Fay Ann still there ? " she heard Track say , his back to her again . He held his cup halfway to his mouth and watched the aunt . He was n't going to drink until she answered , Ivy saw . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Her pop died a while back , left her the store . Her and her girl live upstairs from it now . " She took another look at Track . " That where you lived ? " she asked . He did n't answer . <p> " That would have been before my time , " she said . " I came up from Macon after the war . I did n't know Fay Ann until her girl was born . I never even met her young man . " <p> Track finished his coffee . " Yeah ? " he said . <p> She shrugged . " He did n't make it back from the war , " she said . " I do n't know who all . " <p> Track got up from the counter and went over to the old piano , standing in front of it and touching one key with his finger . He sat down , pulling the chair in close , and spread his hands out as if he were going to play , like the boy . Ivy turned from Buzzy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do it , to make the notes come astoundingly on top of each other , even though as far as she knew he had never touched a piano before in his life . But he just mimed it , gently , on the tops of the keys , and then let his hands go limp on the wood at the end , his shoulders sagging . <p> " I always did want to learn to play like that , " he said . He put his lips together and nodded as if he could hear the tune . Then he looked around , at Ivy for a second and then at the aunt . " Always thinking of them old songs , " he said . <p> The aunt smiled on one side of her face . " Same as that boy , " she said . " Stay the night and he 'll play you some more . " She took a key off a hook under the cash register and held it out to him . <p> Track got up then , heavily , and went to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands braced against the wood on either side , looking out at the parking lot . Ivy could hear the children yelling outside , playing some game and running around in the lot . Then she saw Track reach in his pocket , take out a couple of bills and put them on the counter for the aunt to take . For just a half second he hesitated , looking at her as if he had forgotten what he was going to say . <p> " This 'll be for the food , " he said . " I guess we got to be going on . " <p> When the kids finally settled back into quiet , they had been on the road for an hour at least . Bella-Jean had fallen asleep on the back shelf while the car was being loaded up , and Helena sat up in front , in the middle . Buzzy was snoring lightly , his open mouth against the breast . <p> With her face turned toward the open window , Ivy could feel the slow cooling of the air as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some road without a number , heading northeast to where they could pick up a highway and stop . The sky was already turning dark down by the hills in the distance , and Track sang to himself under his breath , not much louder than the low noise he made when he slept . She was tired through . <p> " I do n't see why we could n't have stayed there , " Tad said from the back . She turned to hush him ; he was slumped against his pillowcase in the corner of the seat , his face streaked with the day 's dirt , his eyes that were Track 's looking sleepily back at her . Across Helena between them , Track reached over his hand in the middle of his song and laid it on Ivy 's lap . For a moment she could not think what to say ; she was aware only of the weight of the car on the road , its tires moving heavily over the hot macadam , the rough , freckled skin of Track 's hand next to Buzzy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all still in her mind . <p> " It cost too much , honey , " she said at last , thinking to answer Tad . " You go on to sleep . " Track lifted his hand to the dash ; she saw him open the pocket and take out the map . " When you wake up , we 'll be there , " Ivy said to her children in the back , making her voice slow like a lullaby , to rock them into the darkness . Out the car window , the light was fading swiftly , and she looked into the expanse of evening , imagining her limbs opening into its space , her arms stretching over her head as far as she could reach them . She better not make any promises she could n't keep . " When you wake up next time , we 'll be almost there . " <p> <p> By KATHLEEN CUSHMAN <p>
