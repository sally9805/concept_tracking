<p> WHEN Joseph Cicio became chief executive officer of I. Magnin last September , he decided the store was overlooking a potential customer : the career woman with advanced fashion taste but a limited budget . <p> " " The store had a brilliant designer business and designer image , " he said in a recent interview in the San Francisco store , " " but the young career customer was not a shopper in this store . " <p> Now she is , he said . What brought her in was a whole new floor devoted to her needs that opened in January . Called the New Edge , it carries Donna Karan 's DKNY line along with designers such as Byron Lars , Norma Kamali , Todd Oldham , Anna Sui and Gemma Kahng . <p> When Burton Tansky went from Saks Fifth Avenue to Bergdorf Goodman as vice chairman two and a half years ago , he realized that the store was not attracting enough young women who worked in the neighborhood . Bergdorf 's was known for its high-priced fashion , and the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ill-lighted labyrinth on the fifth floor . <p> " " I saw redoing the fifth floor as a priority , " he said recently . " " With my background at Saks , I knew that business had enormous potential . " <p> By last September , he was chairman of the store and had a new floor , called On 5 , with wide open spaces , bright lighting and a mix of labels such as DKNY , CK Calvin Klein , Adrienne Vittadini , Rifat Ozbek , Norma Kamali and Anne Klein II . <p> Now the floor is attracting two kinds of women , said Ellin Saltzman , the fashion director of the store . " " We 're getting the establishment customer who has discovered that kind of merchandise for weekend wear and the " I work in the area and never shopped at Bergdorf Goodman ' customer , " she said . <p> These two specialty stores on opposite coasts are examples of how retailers are responding to the changing winds of fashion . The head-to-toe designer look favored by fashionable women in the ' 80s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Many women either can not or do not want to spend a fortune on clothes and are looking for less expensive outfits or for items to mix with what they have in their closets . <p> And the emergence in recent years of exciting young designers such as Byron Lars and Todd Oldham has created a new niche in retailing . Their clothes are not expensive enough to hang alongside , say , the Calvin Klein collection and are too adventurous to blend comfortably with so-called career lines , which are generally classic styles that are less expensive than designer clothes . <p> Barneys New York was probably the first store to try to fill that void when it opened the Coop in 1986 as an adjunct to its women 's store on 17th Street . The Coop , with a separate entrance , serves the fashion forward customer on a limited budget . <p> Department stores , being larger and more structured , have gone after that customer in different ways . Most have career clothes in one area and young designer clothes in another . <p> Bloomingdale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as CK Calvin Klein and DKNY , along with career lines , on the third floor of its Manhattan store , trendy lines such as Anna Sui and Junior Gaultier on two , and designer collections ranging from Armani to Mizrahi on four . <p> The block-square third floor of Macy 's Herald Square store is divided into designer , bridge , sportswear and young designer areas . <p> Macy 's San Francisco has a street-floor shop for on-the-edge designers such as Moschino , Ozbek , Ann de Meulemeester and Todd Oldham , with career collections such as Ellen Tracy on two . <p> But Bergdorf 's and I. Magnin are banking on the assumption that a young customer has emerged who wants to do all her shopping in one place . Bergdorf 's On 5 has career clothes by Anne Klein II , party clothes by Norma Kamali , casual wear by Henry Lehr and cosmetics by Bobbi Brown , plus handbags , hats , jewelry , shoes and swimwear , and even a cafe . <p> " " My idea is that the entire floor is a boutique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merchandise is not based on price but on attitude , designs that work together and serve a young , forward-thinking customer . It 's a destination floor , not a designer floor . " So there are no signs with designer or brand names . The store 's theory is that the customer for that floor is not interested in names but in clothing that attracts her eye and fills a need . But it can be confusing to shop there . ( " " We may put the names up yet , " Tansky admitted . ) <p> " " I 'm sure there was some difficulty for the customer to find us at first , " said Carol Anweiler , the vice president of sales for Anne Klein II , " " but Bergdorf Goodman has a loyal following , so our department became a destination . Our business is up 30 percent over last year . " Denise Seegal , the president of DKNY , said her customers found the configuration of the floor confusing at first . " " But once they find us , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bigger and better space that can house the merchandise much better . " <p> Because there are no defined areas for specific designers and all the fixtures are movable , the store has great flexibility in moving vendors and expanding or shrinking their space . For a small company such as Byron Lars , this can present difficulty . <p> " " There 's a tremendous movement of vendors around the floor , " said Mary Ann Wheaton , the designer 's managing partner . <p> " " When there 's no sign with your name and you 're not in a specific area , it 's hard to serve your customer . You need to build some return business , but the customer is never sure where you are . <p> But the flexibility can work well for a big company that commands sizable space . <p> " " The old fifth floor was very inefficient , " said Richard Catalano , the president of Adrienne Vittadini . " " Our clothes look much better on the new floor , and our business at Bergdorf 's has doubled over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's a lot of merchandise and shrink it when the goods sell out , " <p> Joseph M. Boitano , a senior vice president of Bergdorf 's , said sales on the floor so far have exceeded the store 's expectations , but it has been a learning experience . " " We 're learning about the customer , the way she likes to shop , when she likes to shop and what she likes , " he said . <p> The New Edge at I. Magnin is also built around the boutique-within-a-store concept . The sixth floor of the San Francisco store is a world unto itself , with clothing for work , play and evening , handbags , belts , hats , jewelry , shoes , gifts and a coffee bar . <p> " " Before I came here , the sixth floor had Ellen Tracy and other moderate-price lines , which I moved to four , " Cicio said . <p> " " If we 're going to be successful , we have to be different , aggressive and courageous . Each floor should be like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't just trendy . <p> It 's dressing that customer for work and weekends and evenings . I want to keep improving the content , but we 're already doing about five times the business the floor was doing before . " <p> Carol Dupuis , vice president of sales for Byron Lars , said : " " We were on the designer floor next to Lagerfeld , and it was n't right for us . <p> As soon as we moved , business started to boom . They 've created an environment . <p> Tony Longorio , Todd Oldham 's sales director , said : " " the sixth floor of Magnin 's is where our customer is going . It 's where we really need to be . Our customer buys established designers to a certain extent , but she also goes to the sixth floor to find more spirited clothes . " The realignment has not worked so well for DKNY . " " Magnin 's used to have our to-work clothes on four and casual on six , " Seegal said . " " Now it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it 's been difficult for us . " <p> But for Cicio , who was a vice president of Macy 's before taking this job , it was crucial to send a new message . I. Magnin is owned by R.H. Macy &; Co. , which is restructuring to get out of bankruptcy . Unprofitable Magnin branches have been closed , stores are being redesigned and the merchandise mix is being broadened . <p> " " I felt the store was a little too mature and much too expensive , " Cicio said . " " There were no umbrellas under $ 300 ! I had to look for every opportunity to be distinctive special and profitable . "
