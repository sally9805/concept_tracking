A few days after the nightmare of Super Bowl XXIX , San Diego Charger quarterback Stan Humphries headed up the California coast to play in the Pebble Beach pro-am golf tournament . He needed a break after his team 's humiliating 49-26 loss to the San Francisco 49ers . Humphries settled in on the practice range , and on his ninth or 10th drive he felt an intense pain shoot through his left elbow . I dislocated the elbow again , he thought to himself . Looking down , he saw that the bone was cleanly dislodged from the socket . // And so San Diego 's off-season began . During the next seven months Humphries underwent reconstructive surgery on his nonthrowing elbow ; a stalwart defensive player was killed in an auto accident ; the team failed to sign either of the free-agent linebackers it needed ; the star running back had a nasty contract holdout ; the premier pass rusher announced that he wanted to leave San Diego ; and the best cornerback ignored the team doctor 's counsel and aggravated an injury that will keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of shoddy preseason performances at home , including Sunday night 's 17-6 loss to the 49ers , have further reminded the Chargers that the rosy glow of their unexpected success in winning the 1994 AFC title is long gone . Says G.M. Bobby Beathard , " When you do n't see that same single-mindedness , that same dedication  --  and when a few other things seem to be going wrong  --  it worries you . " // In fact , a lot has gone wrong for the Chargers lately : // ? Under the contract he signed as a rookie in 1993 , tailback Natrone Means was to have made $330,000 this season , but he held out for 11 days last month , seeking to have the contract replaced by a five-year , $16.6 million deal . When Beathard balked at Means 's demands , the player ripped him in a statement issued by Means 's agent . " I have a severe problem with the way Beathard has betrayed me , " the statement read . The rhetoric was absurd . Means did gain 1,350 yards last year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' last 10 games , and he averaged a measly 3.39 yards per carry in November and December . Means settled for $7,337 million over four years , and he extracted a promise from Beathard that if he has a " good " year San Diego will draw up yet another contract in ' 96. // ? On June 19 David Griggs , the starting strongside linebacker , was killed in a one-car accident in Florida . He was later determined to have been drunk . Having been outbid for free agents Kurt Gouveia and Rod Stephens , the Chargers were already weak at linebacker . To replace Griggs , San Diego has had to move up third-year pro Lewis Bush from his spot as backup to Junior Seau . But Bush has been hobbled by a bruised right leg , and one of the two linebackers drafted in April , Preston Harrison , has been hurt throughout training camp . // ? The Charger brass awoke last Friday to read in the morning Union-Tribune that defensive end Leslie O'Neal , the NFL 's sack leader of the ' 90s , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elsewhere . O'Neal is bitter because last year 's secondary coach , Willie Shaw , who is black , was passed over for the defensive coordinator 's job in favor of former Kansas City Chief assistant Dave Adolph , who is white . " They make a big deal about continuity and loyalty here , " O'Neal said to SI last week . " What happened to continuity and loyalty with Willie Shaw ? Then I talk about it , and I 'm the bad guy . " San Diego chose Adolph because he has spent the past 11 seasons as a defensive coordinator , the last six of them in the Chargers ' AFC West . Shaw had never been an NFL defensive coordinator , though after San Diego passed him over he was hired at that position by the St. Louis Rams. // ? Darrien Gordon , the 1994 AFC punt-return leader and a rising star at corner-back , finished the season with a torn right rotator cuff , but he spurned the advice of Charger physician Gary Losse , who recommended major shoulder surgery , and instead chose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first preseason game , against the Minnesota Vikings on Aug. 7 , Gordon reinjured the shoulder . He has now had the operation that Losse suggested in the first place . // " There are so many different people who have such an impact on your team who are n't under your control , " says coach Bobby Ross , who spent 17 years supervising far more malleable players in the college ranks before joining the Chargers in 1992 . " Frankly , it 's one of the things I do n't like about the NFL. " // There were several things Ross did not like about Sunday 's game . Means , for example , dropped the only pass thrown his way and rushed eight times for all of two yards . But there were also a few rays of hope . The Charger offensive line protected Humphries well , letting the 49ers knock him down only once , and the struggling linebacker corps got an interception and 12 tackles from free agent Glen Young . // Despite their deficiencies , the Chargers are still the best team in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controlling the line of scrimmage , especially with the return of guard-tackle Eric Moten from a 1993 knee injury . On defense , the strong pass rush may compensate for the shaky units behind it . " We just want to get back to the Super Bowl so we can show the type of team we really are , " says Humphries.
