 | ham they had brought in their packs . Kitten waddled over to help , or at least to eat the rind that Daine cut from the meat .  - -  - This id very nice , ? a rough voice said in their minds . ? Cozy , especially on a rainy afternoon . ? They twisted to look at the cave entrance . It shone with a silvery light that appeared to come from the animal standing there . The badger waddled in , the light fading around his body . He stopped at a polite distance from their fire and shook himself , water flying everywhere from his long , heavy coat . Daine fingered the silver claw he had once given her . She liked badgers , and her mysterious adviser was a very handsome one . Big for his kind , he was over a yard in length , with a tail a foot long . He weighed at least fifty pounds , and it appeared he could stow a tremendous amount of water in his fur . When he finished shaking , he trundled over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seated as Daine was , she and the badger were nearly eye to eye . She was so close that she could n't escape his thick , musky odor . Daine , is this ? ? " Numair sounded nervous . The badger looked at him , eyes coldly intelligent . ? I told her father I would keep an eye on her . So you are her teacher . She tells me a great deal about you , when I visit her . ? " May I ask you something ? " the mage inquired . ? I am an immortal , the first male creature of my kind . The male badger god , if you like . That is what you wished to ask , is it not ? ? " Yes , and I thank you , " Numair said hesitantly . " I ? thought I had shielded my mind from any kind of magical reading or probe -- Perhaps that works with mortal wizards , ? the badger replied . ? Perhaps it works with lesser immortals , such as Stormwings. 1 am neither . ? Numair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . She doubted that anyone had spoken that way to Numair in a long time . She was used to it . The badger had first appeared in a dream to give her advice sixteen months ago , on her journey to Tortall , and she had dreamed of him often since . " Another question , then , " the mage said doggedly . " Since I have the opportunity to ask . You can resolve a number of academic debates , actually . "  | ? Ask . ? There was studied patience in the badger 's voice . " The inhabitants of the Divine Realms are called by men immortals , ' but the term itself is n't entirely accurate . I know that unless they are killed in some accident or by deliberate intent , creatures such as Stormwings , spidrens , and so on will live forever . They do n't age , either . But how are they lesser immortals ' compared to you , or to the other gods ? " ? They are lesser " because they can be slain , ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed than can Mithros , or the Goddess , or the other gods worshiped by two-leggers . Immortals " is the most fitting term to use . It is not particularly correct , but it w the best you two-leggers can manage . ? Having made Numair speechless , the badger went on . ? Now , on to your teaching . It is well enough , but you have not shown her where to take her next step . I am surprised . For a mortal , your grasp of wild magic normally is good .  - -  Numair looked down his long nose at the guest who called his learning into question . " If you feel I have omitted something , by all means , enlighten us . " The badger sneezed . It seemed to be his way of laughing . ? Daine , if you try , you can learn to enter the mind of a mortal animal . You can use their eyes as you would your own , or their ears , or their noses . ? Daine frowned , trying to understand . " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was part of something I knew how to do . This is n't . " ? Make your mind like that of the animal you join ,  --  he told her . ? Think like that animal does , until you become one . You may be quite surprised by what results in the end . ? It sounded odd , but she knew better than to say as much . She had questioned him once , and he had flattened her with one swipe of his paw . " I 'll try . " ? Do better than try . Where is the young dragon ? Kitten had been watching from the other side of the fire . Now she came to sit with the badger , holding a clump of his fur in one small paw . She had a great deal to say in her vocabulary of chirps , whistles , clicks , and trills . He listened as if it meant something , and when she was done , waddled over to talk with Cloud and the horses . At last he returned to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him to end his private conversations . ? I must go back to my home sett ,  - -  -  he announced .  - -  Things in the Divine Realms have been hectic since the protective wall was breached and the lesser immortals were released into your world . ? " Do you know who did it ? " asked Numair quickly . " We 've been searching for the culprit for two years now . " ? Why in the name of the Lady of Beasts would I know something like that ? ? was the growled reply . ? I have more than enough to do in mortal realms simply with keeping an eye on her .  --  " Do n't be angry , " Daine pleaded . " He thought you might know , since you know so much already . " ? You are a good kit . ? The badger rubbed his head against her knee . Touched by this sign of affection , Daine hugged him , burying her fingers in his shaggy coat . To Numair he added , ? And I am not angry with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has guarded my young friend so well . Let me go , Daine . I have to return to my sett . ? She obeyed . He walked toward the cave 's mouth , silver light enclosing him in a globe . At its brightest , the light flared , then vanished . He was gone . " Well , " said Numair . She thought he might add something , but instead he busied himself with stirring the vegetables . Suddenly she remembered a question she had wanted to ask . " I think he puts a magic on me , " she complained . " How so ? " " Every time I see him , I mean to ask who my da is , and every time I forget ! And he 's the only one who can tell me , too , drat him . " Kitten gave a trill , her slit-pupiled eyes concerned . " I 'm all right , Kit , " the girl said , and sighed . " It 's not fair , though . " Numair chuckled . " Somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She had to smile , even if her smile was one-sided . She knew he was right . " Speaking of what is fair , what do you think of the advice he gave you , about becoming a magical symbiote ? "  | Most of the time she was glad that he spoke to her as he would to a fellow scholar , instead of talking down to her . Just now , though , her head was reeling from Brokefang 's news and the badger 's arrival . " A magical sym ? sym ? whatsis ? " " Symbiote , " he replied . " They are creatures that live off other creatures , but not destructively , as parasites do . An example might be the bird who rides on a bison , picking insects from the beast 's coat . " " Oh . I do n't know what I think of it . I never tried it . " " Now would be a good time , " he said helpfully . " The vegetables will take a while to cook . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until she saw the mare , still at the rear of the cave with Mangle and Spots . " Cloud , can I ? " " Cloud , may I , " the man corrected . You can or you may . I do n't know if it will help , said the mare . The girl went to sit near the pony , while Mangle and Spots ventured outside to graze again . Numair began to get out the ingredients for campfire bread as Kitten watched with interest . " Do n't let him stir the dough too long , " Daine ordered the dragon . " It cooks up hard when he forgets . " Kitten chirped as Numair glared across the cave at his young pupil . The girl closed her eyes . Breathing slowly , she reached deep inside to find the pool of copper light that was her wild magic . Calling a thread of fire from that pool , she reached for Cloud , and tried to bind their minds with it . Cloud whinnied , breaking the girl 's concentration . That hurt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I wo n't do it ! Try it with less magic . Shutting her eyes , Daine obeyed . This time she used a drop of copper fire , thinking to glue her mind to Cloud 's . The mare broke contact the minute Daine 's fire touched hers . Daine tried it a second , and a third time , without success . It 's the same kind of magic , she told Cloud , frustrated . It 's not any different from what 's in you . It hurts , retorted the pony . If that badger knew this would hurt and told you to try it anyway , I will tell him a few things the next time he visits .  | I do n't do it a-purpose , argued Daine . How can I do it without paining you ? Without the fire , Cloud suggested . You do n't need it to talk to us , or to listen . Why should you need it now ? Daine bit a thumbnail . Cloud was right . She only used the fire of her magic when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something hard . She was tired now , and the smell of cooking ham had filled her nostrils . " Let 's try again tomorrow , " she said aloud . " My head aches . " " Come eat , " called Numair . " You 've been at it nearly an hour . " Daine went to the fire , Cloud following . Digging in her pack , the girl handed the pony a carrot before she sat . Numair handed over a bowl of mildly spiced vegetables and cooked ham . Kitten climbed into the girl 's lap , forcing Daine to arrange her arms around the dragon as she ate . Between mouthfuls she explained what had taken place . Cloud listened , nibbling a carrot as her ears flicked back and forth . When Daine finished , the mare suggested , Perhaps I am the wrong one to try with . " Who , then , Cloud ? " Daine asked . " I 've known you longer than anybody . " She yawned . The experiment , even though it had n't worked , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hunter . Why not try with a hunter ? It may be easier to do this first with wolves . You are practically a wolf as it is . " And if I forget I 'm human ? " ( " I wish I could hear both sides of this conversation , " Numair confided softly to Kitten . " I feel so left out , some-times . " ) The man said you wo n't , replied Cloud . He should know . Brokefang is part of you already . Ask the stork-man . He will tell you I am right . Daine relayed this to Numair . " She has a point , " he said . " I had n't thought the predator-prey differential would constitute a barrier , but she knows you better than I. " He watched Daine yawn again , hugely , and smiled . " It can wait until tomorrow . Do n't worry about cleanup . I 'll do it . "  | " But it 's my turn , " she protested . " You cooked , so I have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teacher said quietly . " The moon will not stop its monthly journey simply because I cooked and cleaned on the same meal . " She climbed into her bedroll and was asleep the moment she pulled the blankets up . When the wolves returned much later , she woke just enough to see them group around her . With Kitten curled up on one side and Brokefang sprawled on the other , Daine finished her night 's rest smiling . It was damp and chilly the next morning , the cold a taste of the months to come . Breakfast was a quiet meal , since neither Daine nor Numair was a morning person . They cleaned up together and readied the horses for the day 's journey . The wolves had gone to finish the previous night 's kill . They were returning when Numair handed Daine a small tube of paper tied with plain ribbon . " Can we send this on to the king today ? " he asked . Daine nodded , and reached with her magic . Not far from their campsite was the nest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politely and explained what she wanted . She could have made the bird do as she wished , but that was not the act of a friend . The eagle listened with interest , and agreed . When she came , Daine thanked her , and made sure the instructions for delivering Numair 's report were fixed in Sunclaw 's mind . Numair , who had excellent manners , thanked Sunclaw as well , handing the letter to her with a bow . Brokefang had watched all of this with great interest . You have changed , he commented when Sunclaw had gone . You know so much more now . You will make the two-leggers stop ruining the valley . Daine frowned . I do n't know if I can , she told the wolf . Humans are n't like the People . Animals are sensible . Humans are n't . You will help us , Brokefang repeated , his faith in her shining in his eyes . You said that you would . Now , are you and the man ready ? It is time to go .  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Numair mounted Spots , and the girl mounted Cloud . " Lead on , " the mage told Brokefang . The wolves trotted down the trail away from the cave , followed by the horses and their riders . When the path forked , one end leading to the nearby river and the other into the mountains , Brokefang led them uphill . " If we follow the river , wo n't that take us into the valley ? " Daine called . " It wo n't be so hard on us . " Brokefang halted . It is easier , he agreed , as Daine translated for Numair . Humans go that way all the time . So also do soldiers , and men with magic fires . It is best to avoid them . Men kill wolves on sight , remember , Pack-Sister ? " Men with magic fires ? " Numair asked , frowning . Men like you , said Brokefang , with the Light Inside . " We call them mages , " Daine told him . " Or sorcerers , or wizards , or witches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Numair thought for a moment . " Lead on , " he said at last . " I prefer to avoid human notice for as long as possible . And thank you for the warning . " The humans , Kitten , and the horses followed the wolves up along the side of the mountains that rimmed the valley of the Long Lake . By noon they had come to a section of trail that was bare of trees . The wolves did n't slow , but trotted into the open . Daine halted , listening . Something nasty was tickling at the back of her mind , a familiar sense that had nothing to do with mortal animals . Getting her crossbow , she put an arrow in the notch and fixed it in place with the clip . Numair took a step forward , and Cloud grabbed his tunic in her teeth . " Stormwings , " Daine whispered . Numair drew back from the bare ground . Under the tree cover , they watched the sky . High overhead glided three creatures with human heads and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daine knew from bitter experience that their birdlike limbs were steel , wrought to look like genuine feathers and claws . In sunlight they could angle those feathers to blind their enemies . They  | were battlefield creatures , living in human legend as monsters who dishonored the dead . Eyes cold , she aimed at the largest of the three . Numair put a hand on her arm . " Try to keep an open mind , magelet , " he whispered . " They have n't attacked us . " " Yet , " she hissed . Brokefang looked back to see what was wrong , and saw what they were looking at . These are harriers , he said . They help the soldiers and the mages . Daine relayed this to Numair as the wolves moved on , to wait for them in the trees on the other side of the clearing . " Stormwings that work in conjunction with humans , " the man commented softly . " That sounds like Emperor Ozorne 's work . " The emperor of the southern kingdom of Carthak was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minor immortals , and with Stormwings in particular . Some , Numair included , thought it was Ozorne 's doing that had freed so many immortals from the Divine Realms in the first place . He had his eye on Tortall 's wealth , and many thought he meant to attack when the country 's defenders were worn out from battling immortals . " Now can I shoot them ? " Daine wanted to know . " You may not . They still have done nothing to harm us . " The Stormwings flew off . Vexed with her friend , Daine fumed and waited until she could no longer sense the immortals before leading the way onto the trail once more . They were halfway across the open space when Numair stopped , frowning at a large , blackened crater down the slope from them . " That 's not a natural occurrence , " he remarked , and walked toward it . " This is n't the time to explore ! " Daine hissed . If he heard , he gave no sign of it . With a sigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The wolves wo n't touch you , " she said when Spots wavered . " Now go ! " Follow me , Cloud told the horses ; they obeyed . Daine , with Kitten peering wide-eyed over her shoulder , followed Numair . Blackened earth sprayed from the crater 's center . Other things were charred as well : bones , round metal circles that had been shields before the leather covers burned , trees , axheads ,  | arrowheads , swords . The heat that had done this must have been intense . The clay of the mountainside had glazed in spots , coating the ground with a hard surface that captured what was left of this battle scene . Numair bent over a blackened lump and pulled it apart . Daine looked at a mass of bone close to her , and saw it was a pony 's skeleton . Metal pieces from the dead mount 's tack had fallen in among the bones . Looking around , she counted other dead mounts . The smaller bone heaps belonged to human beings . Grimly Numair faced her and held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was a piece of cloth with a red horse rearing on a gold-brown field . " Now we know what happened to the Ninth Rider Group . " Dame 's hands trembled with fury . She had a great many ties to the Queen 's Riders , and the sight of that charred flag was enough to break her heart . " And you stopped me from shooting those Stormwings . " " They do n't kill with blasting fire like this , " Numair replied . " This is battle magic . I have yet to hear of a Stormwing being a war mage . " " I bet they knew about this , though . " Numair put a hand on her shoulder . " You 're too young to be so closed-minded , " he told her . " A little tolerance would n't come amiss . " Folding the remains of the flag , he climbed back up to the trail .  | Three days after leaving the cave , the wolf pack led the humans and their ponies through a gap in the mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where they ate lunch ; from there they followed a stream downhill , until Brokefang stopped . You must look at something , he told Daine . Leave the horses by that rock  --  they will be safe there , with the rest of the pack to guard them . Daine , with Kitten on her back in a sling , and Numair followed him up a long tumble of rock slabs . When they came to the top , they could see for miles . Far below was the Long Lake . Daine noticed a village where a small river  --  part of the stream they had followed  --  met the lake . Not far offshore , linked to the village by a bridge , was an island capped by a large , well-built castle .  | Numair drew his spyglass from its case . Stretching it to full length , he put it to his eye and surveyed the valley . What is that ? asked the wolf , watching him . " It 's a glass in a tube , " Daine replied . " It makes things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Fief Dunlath , without a doubt . " Numair offered the spyglass to Daine . " I ca n't see the northern reaches of the lake from here . Is that where the damage is being done ? The holes and the tree cutting ? " Most of it , Brokefang replied . That and dens for the soldiers , like those they have at the south gate . " Soldiers at the northern and southern ends of the valley ? " asked Daine . " Then why not here , if they want to put watchdogs at the passes ? " Most two-leggers follow the river in and out , answered Brokefang . Few come here as we did . When they do , usually the harriers catch them outside , as they did those Riders you spoke of . Numair listened as Daine translated . " This is not good , " he muttered , squinting at Dunlath Castle . " There is no reason for this fief to be heavily guarded . Under law they 're only entitled to a force of forty men-at-arms . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a hand , and Daine returned the glass . They continued to examine the valley until Brokefang said , Come . We have a way to go still . Let us find the meeting place , and my mate . Daine and Numair followed the wolf back to the spot where they had left the horses . A strange wolf had joined the others , a gray-and-white female with a boldly marked face . Brokefang raced to meet her , tail erect and wagging gaily . " Well , he 's glad to see this one , " Numair remarked as they followed more slowly . " Who 's the stranger ? " " His mate , Frostfur . The boss female . " Where were you ? Frostfur was demanding of Brokefang . What took so long ? You said you were going only to the other side of the mountain and you have been gone four nights . Daine sighed . She 'd forgotten how much she disliked Frostfur . During her time with the pack , Rattail had been Brokefang 's mate . A sweeter , gentler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | Brokefang had chosen her sister . The new female pack leader was a cross , fidgety animal who had never accepted baine . We were traveling with two-leggers and horses , Brokefang told his mate . They ca n't run as fast as we can . The only two-legger you need is her . Why did n't you leave those others behind ? We can hunt if we are hungry . We do n't need food brought to us , like the humans ' dogs . At this Cloud , who stood between Frostfur and the horses , laid back her ears . Kitten reared up in her sling , bracing her forepaws on Daine 's shoulder , and screeched at the she-wolf . Daine was shocked to hear her friend voice something that sounded so rude . Frostfur looked at them and bared her teeth . " Enough ' ! " the girl ordered . " We 're friends . That means you , Frostfur , and these horses . If you disobey , you 'll be sorry . " Frostfur met her eyes , then looked away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pony both . I suppose you do n't even realize it . The pack never was the same after you left it . How much will you change us this time ? Brokefang nuzzled his mate . It will be good , he told Frostfur . You 'll see . Take us to the pups . You 'll feel better when the pack is one again . Without reply , Frostfur ran down a trail that led north . The wolves and their guests followed . The path took them on a line that ran parallel to the lake . For a game trail it was wide and , if the tracks and marks on the trees and shrubs were to be believed , used by many animals , not only wolves . " Mountain sheep , " Daine commented , showing Numair a tuft of white fur that had caught on a bramble . " A wolverine , too -- keep an eye out for that one . They 're nasty when they 're crossed . " Looking up the trail , she saw each of the wolves stop to lift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ females did so , which was odd . Marking territory was normally done only by males . " Graveyard Hag , what are they doing ? " she asked , naming one of Numair 's gods . She trotted to the head of the line . " What is this ? " she asked . " What 's wrong with the meat ? " Brokefang replied , One of the two-leggers is a hunter of wolves . He leaves poisoned meat on our trails . We are telling him what we think of this . When he comes to check the meat , he will curse and throw things . It is fun to watch .  | Daine laughed , and went to explain it to Numair . They made several stops to express such opinions : twice at snares , once at a trap , and once at a pit covered with leaves and branches . Each time the wolves marked the spot with urine and dung , leaving a smelly mess for the hunter . At the last two stops , the horses and Cloud also left tokens of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daine told Numair and Kitten . " He 'll never figure out how horses came to mark a wolf scent post . " A lesser trail split from the one they walked ; the wolves followed it into a cuplike valley set deep in the mountainside , hidden by tangles of rock . There the woods opened onto a clearing around a pond . At the water 's edge trails crossed and recrossed , and large , flattened areas in the brush marked wolf beds . A challenge-bark came from a bunch of reeds , and five halfgrown wolves , their colors ranging from brown to frosted gray , tumbled out . They still bore remnants of soft baby fur , and were in the process of trading milk teeth for meat teeth . Eyeing the strangers , they whined and growled nervously , until the pack surrounded them and shut the newcomers off from view . Another grown wolf , a black , gray , and brown male , pranced over to say hello . " He 's Longwind , " Daine informed Numair . " He was baby-sitting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my friends . Cloud you know . " As Longwind obeyed , the girl walked up to the pack . The moment the pups noticed her they backed away . Frostfur said with grim satisfaction , I knew bringing strangers was a mistake . Brokefang nuzzled his mate , trying to sweeten her temper . Fleetfoot stuck her nose under the belly of one of the male pups and scooted him forward . We know this is n't what you 're used to , she told him , but you may as well learn now as later . Russet gripped a female pup by the scruff of the neck and dragged her to the girl , adding , Daine is Pack , and if she is Pack , so are these others . The female was the one to walk forward , still clumsy on her feet , to sniff Daine 's palm . She is Leaper , Russet said , and Leaper wagged her tail . The male pup trotted over . He is  | Chaser , commented Russet . These others are too silly to have names . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Daine introduced the young wolves to her friends . The pups came to accept Numair , the horses , and Cloud , but nothing could make them like the young dragon . When she went near them , they would run to hide behind an adult wolf . At last Kitten turned gray , the color that meant she was sulking , and waddled over to the pond . There she played with stones , pretending to ignore everyone . Why is she sad ? asked Russet . They are pups . They do n't know any better . " She 's no more than a pup herself , " Daine replied . " I ca n't even talk to her as I could to her ma . She looks big , but as dragons go she 's a baby . " I see . Getting up , the red-coated wolf trotted over to the dragon and began to paw at her rocks . Soon they were playing , and Kitten 's scales regained their normal , gold-tinged blue color . Daine was wrestling a stick out of the jaws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brokefang came to say , We hunt . Since the pups accept you and Numair and the horses , will you guard them ? " We 'll be honored to guard your pups , " Daine told him . The pack left , and Numair began to cook as Daine groomed the horses . The smell of frying bacon called the pups to the fire , their noses twitching . The new scent canceled some of their fear of Kitten : as long as she kept to one side of the fire and they to the other , the young wolves did n't object . When the first pan of bacon was done , Numair gave in to the pleading in five pairs of brown eyes and one pair of slit-pupiled blue , and doled it out to his audience . After Numair , the pups , and the horses went to bed , Daine lay awake , listening to the chatter of owls and bats . At the fringe of her magic she felt immortals pass overhead . They were n't Stormwings , or griffins , or any of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not like these if they did meet . There was a nasty undertone to them in her mind , like t he taint of old blood .  | The pack returned not long after the creatures ' presence faded in her mind . Was it good hunting ? she asked Brokefang silently , so she would n't disturb Numair . He came to sit with her . An old and stringy elk . He gave us a good run , though , he replied . Cloud says you are trying to fit into her skull . It sounds like an interesting thing . I tried it once , said Daine . Cloud thinks I might do better with wolves . I would have asked before , but I needed to rest first . Are you rested now ? he wanted to know . I would like you to try it with me . She smiled and said , All right . And thank you . Must I do anything in particular ? No . Just wait . She closed her eyes , took a breath , let it out . Sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's moan as he dreamed of rabbits , the pups chewing , Battle washing a paw . Beyond those noises she heard others belonging to the forest and air around them . She concentrated on Brokefang until she heard fleas moving in his pelt . He yawned , so close that it felt as if he yawned inside her ears . She listened for his thoughts and found them : the odor of blood from his kill , the drip of water from the trees overhead , the joy of being one with the pack . Brokefang sighed Daine was sleepy ; her belly was overly full and rumbling as it broke the elk meat down . She could see young Silly from where she lay ; he was asleep on his back with his paws in the air . She crinkled her whiskers in a silent laugh . The smells , the sounds . She had never been so aware of them in her life . There was the wind through pine needles , singing of rocks and open sky . Below , a mole was digging . Her nostrils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her packmates . There was the hay-and-hide scent of the horses-who-are-notprey , enticing but untouchable . A whiff of flowers , animal musk , and cotton was the girl-who-is-Pack . She looked at the girl , and realized she looked at herself . It was a jolt to see her own face from the outside , one that sent her back into herself . Daine opened her eyes . " I did it ! "  | Numair stirred as the pack got up . " You did what ? " he asked sleepily . Brokefang washed Daine 's ear as she explained , " I was Brokefang . I mean , we were both in Brokefang 's mind . We were wolves ? I was a wolf . It was only for a few minutes , but it happened ! " The man sat up , hugging his knees . " Good . Next time you can do it longer . " He looked at Brokefang . " Did it hurt you the way it hurt Cloud ? " No , the wolf replied as Daine translated . We will do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last she was sleepy . " Tomorrow , " she promised , wriggling down into her bedroll . Brokefang yawned when she did . Tomorrow , he agreed , as sleepy as she was . When she woke , it was well past dawn . Numair crouched beside the pond , with Kitten and the pack behind him , watching what he did with interest . Faint black fire dotted with white sparks spilled from his hands to the water 's surface , forming a circle there . At last he sighed . The fire vanished . " What was that ? " Daine asked , dressing under the cover of her blankets . " There 's an occult net over the valley , " he said , grimacing as he got to his feet . " It 's subtle ? I doubt many would even sense it  --  and it serves to detect the use of magic . It also would block all messages I might send to the king . To anyone , for that matter . And since this valley is hidden beneath the aura cast by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell the net is here . " " Wonderful , " she said dryly . " So Dunlath is a secret within a secret . " Numair beamed at her . " Precisely . I could n't have put it better . " " And this net  --  will it pick up any magic ? " she asked , putting her bed to rights . " Will them that set it know you just looked at it ? " " No . A scrying spell is passive , not active . It shows what exists without influencing it . "  | " What 's here that 's so important ? " Daine asked . " Stormwing patrols , two forts , a magical net  --  what has Fief Dunlath got that needs so much protecting ? " " We need to find out , " Numair said . " As soon as you 've had breakfast , I think we should see the northern part of the valley . " She ate as Numair set the camp in order and saddled Cloud and Spots . Mangle agreed to stay with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was to be left alone . The girl then offered the carry-sling to Kitten . The young dragon looked at it , then at the still-nervous Mangle . She shook her head and trotted over to the packhorse , clearly choosing to stay and keep him company . With the small dragon by his feet , Mangle relaxed . Daine , who knew Kitten was well able to protect herself , relaxed as well , and mounted Cloud . Brokefang , Fleetfoot , and Short Snout led the way as she and Numair fol-lowed . The group used a trail high on the mountainside , one that was broad enough for the horses , and kept moving all morning , headed north . Daine listened hard for immortals , and called a halt twice as Stormwings passed overhead . Stop , Brokefang ordered at last . We must leave the trail here . We will hide , Cloud told her , with Spots 's agreement . Do n't worry about us . Afoot , Daine and Numair trailed the wolves through a cut in the ground that led up into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cliff , Fleetfoot and Short Snout behind . The two humans kept low and joined them . Lying on their bellies next to their guides , they looked over the edge of the cliff . Few trees stood in the upper ten miles of the lake 's western edge : most lay in a wood between the fort structure and the river that flowed into the north end of the lake . Much of the ground between that fort and their vantage point was heaped into mounds of dirt and rock , some of them small hills in their own right . The only greenery to speak of was patches of scraggly weed . Roads were cut into the dirt , leading down to deep pits that lay between the mounds . Men and ogres alike toiled here ,  | dressed in loincloths and little else . Some pulled dirt-filled carts out of the pits . When they returned with empty carts , they vanished into the black , yawning holes of the mines . Wherever she looked she saw ogres , aqua-skinned beings that varied in size from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straggly hair was chopped to a rough stubble that went as low as their necks and shoulders . They had pointed ears that swiveled to catch any sound , bulging eyes , and yellowing , peglike teeth . She was no stranger to their kind , but most of her meetings with them had been fights of one sort or another . This was the first time she had seen any used as beasts of burden , or as slaves . All of them appeared to be at the mercy of the armed humans who patrolled the entire area . One ogre , a sad and skinny creature , slumped to his knees . Three humans . came after him , their whips raised . ( ) aine looked away . On her right was the lake . Barracklike buildings , some big enough to house ogres , had been erected of raw wood on the near shore . Between them , human and ogre children played under the watchful eye of an ogre female . The fort on the town 's north side was well built and , to judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , well manned . Boats lay at docks on the lake between town and fort , guarded by men . She closed her eyes , listening for animals . In the pits she card only a few rats and mice . Every other animal had fled the cone of destruction , and its fringes were loud with battles knight over every bit of food . In the lake she heard death . Filth lay in the water : garbage from the town and fort , waste dirt from the mines . The fish gasped for air in the lake 's northern waters . Their kinfolk in cleaner water went hungry as food sources died . Brokefang stuck his cold nose into the girl 's ear . I told you , he said . " Those are mines , " Numair commented , his voice low . He unhooked his spyglass from his belt , opened it , and put it to his rye . " But what are they for ? The opal mines around here were emptied nearly half a century ago . " " What are opals ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like other gemstones . Mages will do anything to get opals , particularly black opals . " Daine was puzzled . Since her arrival in Tortall she had seen all kinds of precious stones , but not those . " What do they look like ? " Numair lifted a chain that lay around his neck , under his shirt . From it hung a single , oval gem that shimmered with blue , green , orange , and gold fires . " Opals are power stones . Black ones like this are the best . They store magic , or you may use the stone to increase the strength of a spell . I saved for years to purchase this . Emperor Ozorne has a collar made of them ? six rows , threaded on gold wire . He has a mine somewhere , but he guards the location even more carefully than he guards his power . " He glared at the mines . " Surely we would know if opal dirt were found here once more . Dunlath LI a Tortallan fief . " The ground shook last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mountains , behind the fort ? Cliffs fell there . In spring , when the pups were new and still blind , a mage came and exploded holes where the pits are now . " Let us speculate , " Numair said when Daine finished translating . " Something of value  --  opal dirt , for example , or even gold  --  was seen in the fallen cliffs , after the earthquake . The lord of Dunlath sent for a mage with blasting expertise , doubtless a war mage , on the chance he would uncover more  --  and he did . It may be the same mage who destroyed the Ninth Riders . But who buys what is taken from the land ? It is n't the king , or he would have told us . " Daine looked back at the mines . The ogre who had fallen was on his feet again , blue liquid  --  his blood  --  coursing down his back in stripes . " I do n't care if they are ogres , " she said quietly . " That 's slavery down there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It appears they are expanding , too . " Numair pointed over Daine 's shoulder . Here , in a direction she had not looked before , humans and ogres with axes were hard at work , cutting down trees and dragging the stumps from the ground . Now you see why we need you , Brokefang said , baring his teeth as he watched the tree cutting . This must stop . It will stop . Soon there will be no game , and everyone here will starve , even the ones who ordered this .  | " We need to learn more , " Numair replied . " We need to weak with those in charge , in the fief village and the castle . Then I want to get word to King Jonathan . Something is badly amiss . " He inched back into the cover of the trees , Daine , Fleetfoot , and Short Snout following . Realizing Brokefang had not come with them , Daine looked back . The chief wolf stood on the cliff , his fur bristling , his ears forward and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below . On their return to the campsite , Daine let the others go ahead as she took her crossbow and went hunting . She was in luck , finding and bagging two plump rabbits soon after leaving the trail . Human friends often exclaimed to see her hunt . They seemed to think , because she shared a bond with animals , that she ought to go meatless . " That 's fair daft , " she had said when Princess Kalasin mentioned it . " Some of my best friends are hunters . I 'm a hunter . You eat what you 're made to eat . I just make sure I do n't use my power to bring game to me , and I stop listening for animal voices with my magic . I close it all off ' . " " You can do that ? " Kally had asked , eyes wide . " I must , " Daine had replied . " Otherwise my hunting would be  --  dirty . Vile . When I go , I hunt like any other two-legger , looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something else . I kill fast and clean , so my game does n't suffer . You know I can , too . I almost never miss a shot . " " I suppose , if that 's how you do it , it 's all right , " the girl had said , though she still looked puzzled . Daine had snorted . " Fairer than them that kill an animal for its horns or skin , so they can tack it on their wall . I hunt to eat , and only to eat . " When she reached the camp , it was nearly dark . The pack had gone , leaving Russet , Numair , and Kitten with the pups and horses . Once Daine appeared , Russet left to hunt for himNumair , who had started a pot of ' rice , smiled when he saw her , but he looked preoccupied . From experience she knew it did no good to talk when something was on his mind , so she let him be .  | Once her rabbits were cleaned , spitted , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rough patches in Kitten 's hide , and wrestled with the pups . She ate quickly when supper was done , and cleaned up without bothering Numair . He wandered to the opposite side of the pond , where he stretched out on the ground and lay staring at the trees overhead . Russet came back , grinning . All that was left of a pheasant who had not seen him in the brush was a handful of bright feathers in his fur . He panted as Daine pulled them out , then licked her face . " Would you help me do something ? " Daine asked , and explained the badger 's lesson . It sounds interesting , the young wolf answered . What must I do ? " Nothing , " the girl said . " I have to come into you . " Closing her eyes , she took a deep breath and let it go . All around she heard familiar noises . Numair had gone to sleep . Cloud drowsed where she stood , dreaming of galloping along an endless plain . Kitten sorted through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed out everything but Russet 's sounds : his powerful lungs taking air in and letting it go , the twitch of an ear , the pulse of his heart . She drew closer and closer until his thoughts crept into her mind . On the surface were simple things , like the shred of pheasant caught on a back tooth , the coolness of the packed earth under his body , his enjoyment of being with her . Below that was the powerful sense of Pack that was part of any wolf , the feeling of being one with a group where everything was shared . The change from her mind to his was gradual this time . It felt as if she were water sinking into earth , becoming part of him in slow bits . When he blinked , vision came in blacks , whites , and grays , and she knew she saw through his eyes . Her ears picked up the tiniest movement , from the scratch of Kitten 's claws on her pebbles to the grubbing of a mouse in the reeds . He inhaled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the individual scents of everyone in the clearing , wet earth , pines , the fire , moss , traces of cooked rabbit and plants .  | He sniffed again , and caught a whiff of scent from the rench Daine and Numair used as a privy . The girl was amazed . She disliked that smell , and had dug the trench far from the clearing where they ate and slept on purpose . She certainly could n't detect it with her own nose . Not only could Russet smell it clearly , but he did n't think the trench odor was bad ? just interesting . Silly galloped over to leap on Russet 's back , and Daine was hack within her own mind . " Thank you , " she told Russet in a whisper . Thank you , he replied , and trotted off to romp with the pups . She stretched , not quite comfortable yet in her skin . The change to her own senses was a letdown . As good as her ears were , they were not nearly as sharp as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his . While she was glad not to be able to smell the trench once more , there had been plenty of good scents available to Russet . " At least I see colors , " she told Kitten . " That 's something . " The pack returned with full bellies as she was banking the fire . They had fed on a sheep that had strayed from its flock , reducing it to little more than a handful of well-gnawed bones . Daine frowned when she heard this . " But that 's one of the things that makes two-leggers hunt you , when you eat their ani-mals . " They will not find out , Brokefang said calmly . When you ran with the pack before , you warned us about human herds . We can not stop eating them . They are slow , and soft , without hard feet or sharp horns to protect them . What we can do is hide signs of the kill . We sank what was left in a marsh , and we dragged leafy branches over the place where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reassuring her , his answer made her uneasy . Here was more unwolflike behavior , a result of the pack 's involvement with her . Where would it end ? She could n't even ? ay the change was only in Brokefang , because the rest of the pack helped him . She had to think of a way to protect them , or to change them back to normal beasts , before humans decided the Long Lake Pack was too unusual  --  too dangerous  --  to live .  | That plan would have to wait . The badger 's lesson had tired her again . She went to bed , and dreamed of men slaughtering wolves . In the morning Daine and Numair rode to the town of Fief Dunlath , leaving the wolves behind . Reaching the village at noon , they entered the stable yard of the town 's small , tidy inn . Hostlers came to take their horses . Dismounting from Cloud , Daine took the pack in which as their eyes adjusted from the sunny yard to the dark common room . In the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guests ! " The innkeeper came out and bowed to Numair . " Good day to you , sir . Ye require service ? " he asked with a brisk mountain accent . " Yes , please . I 'd like adjoining rooms for my student and me . " " Forgive me , mistress , " Parlan said , bowing to Daine . " I dinna see ye . " He looked her over , then asked Numair , " Ye said  --  adjoinin ' rooms , sir ? " " Yes , " Numair replied . " If there 's a connecting door , it must be locked . " The innkeeper bowed , but his eyes were on Daine . " Forgive me , sir  --  locked ? " Daine blushed , and Numair looked down his nose at the man . " People have sordid minds , Master Parlan . " Despite his travel-worn clothes , he spoke like a man used to the obedience of servants . " I would like my student to be spared idle gossip , if you please . " Parlan bowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir , overlooking the kitchen garden . Very quiet  --  not that we 've much excitement in these parts . " " Excellent . We will take hot baths , as soon as you are able to manage , please . " A gold coin appeared in Numair 's hand and disappeared in Parlan 's . " And lunch , I think , after the baths , " added the mage . " Very good , sir , " the man said . " Follow me . " He led the way upstairs .  | Kitten wriggled in the pack , and chirped . " Hush , " Daine whispered as Parlan opened their rooms . " I 'll let you out in a moment . " The room was a small one , but clean and neatly kept , and the bath was all Daine could hope for after weeks of river and stream bathing . The food brought by the maid was plain and good . Daine felt renewed afterward , enough so that she took a short nap . She was awakened by a scratching noise . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lock on the door between the two rooms . " Leave it be , Kit , " Daine ordered , yawning . " You 've seen locks back home . " The young immortal sat on her haunches , stretching so that her eye was on a level with the keyhole , and gave a soft trill . The door swung open to reveal Numair in a clean shirt and breeches . He was holding a piece of paper . " Did I know she could do that ? " he asked with a frown . " No more did I , " retorted Daine . Numair glared at the dragon , who was investigating his room as thoroughly as she had her own . " That door was locked for a rea , ion , " he told her sternly . To Daine he added , " Though actually I do need to speak with you . We 've been invited to dine tonight at the castle . " " Why ? " the girl asked , rubbing her eyes . " It 's typical of nobles who live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention  --  it 's how they get news . I do n't suppose you packed a dress . " Since her arrival in Tortall , when her Rider friends had introduced her to breeches , she had worn skirts rarely , and always under protest . When the village seamstress showed her the only gown that would be ready in time , Daine balked . The dress was pink muslin , with lace at collar and cuffs  --  a lady 's garment , in a color she hated . She announced she would go in breeches or not at all . Numair , usually easygoing , sometimes showed an obstinate streak to rival Cloud 's . By the time their escort came , Daine wore lace-trimmed petticoats , leather shoes , and the pink dress under a wool cloak to ward off the nighttime chill . A maid had  | done up her stubborn curls , pinning them into a knot at the back of her neck . Kitten 's mood was no better than Daine 's : told she could not go with them , the dragon turned gray and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to guide them across the causeway to the island and its castle . Hostlers took charge of Spots and Cloud , and servants took their cloaks , all in welltrained silence . A footman led them across the entrance hall to a pair of half-open doors . Behind those doors a man was saying , " ... know wolves like th ' back of m'hand . I tell ye , these have got to be werewolves or sommat from th ' Divine Realms . They do n't act as wolves should act ! See this ? an ' this ? Laughin ' at me , that 's what they 're doin ' ! " " My lord , my ladies , " the footman said , breaking in , " your guests are here . " He bowed to Numair and Daine and ushered them in ahead of him . " I present Master Numair Salmalin , of Corus , and his student , called Daine . " They were in an elegant sitting room , being looked over by its occupants . The footman announced , " My lord Belden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dunlath , Lord Belden 's wife and heiress of Dunlath . Lady Maura of Dunlath , my lady 's sister . " Numair bowed ; Daine attempted a curtsy . Yolane , in her thirties , and Maura , a girl of ten , were seated by the hearth fire . Though introduced as sisters , there was little resemblance between them . Yolane was beautiful , with ivory-and-rose skin , large brown eyes , a tumble of reddish brown curls , and a soft mouth . Her crimson silk gown hugged a trim body and narrow waist ; deep falls of lace at her wrists drew the eye to long , elegant hands . Diamonds glittered around her neck and at her earlobes . Maura was painfully plain , a stocky child with straight brown hair , attired in a blue dress that fit badly . Lord Belden was of an age with his wife , a lean , bearded man who showed more interest in his wineglass than in his guests . His brown hair and beard were clipped short . His clothing was equally businesslike , though his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the finest quality .  | Before the nobles stood a man in rough leather . He bristled with weapons , and held a pair of wolf traps . Yolane fanned herself , trying to disperse the aroma that came from the traps ; Maura held her nose . The wolfhounds that sat or sprawled at the hunter 's feet rose when they saw Daine . Slowly they went to her , their wire-haired faces eager . She offered her hands for them to sniff . " Here ! " barked the hunter . " Them ai n't ladies ' dogs ! They 're fierce hunters , and no ' t ' be cosseted ! " Daine snickered as the hunters crowded around her , tails wagging . " Yes , you 're fine dogs , " she whispered , returning their welcome . " You 're lovely dogs , even if you do hunt wolves . " We try to hunt them , the chief of the wolfhounds said . The man would like us to succeed , but how can we , when wolves do such strange things ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yolane . " This is a civilized gathering . " The huntsman stalked out , whistling to his dogs . They followed obediently , with an apology to Daine . As they went , they brushed past another man who entered , smiling wryly . He was broad shouldered and handsome , dressed neatly in a white shirt , brown silk tunic and hose , and polished boots . His brown-blond hair was clipped short over a clean and open face . Coming up behind Numair , he said , " I hope you forgive my Numair turned to look at him , and the stranger 's jaw dropped . His hazel eyes opened wide in shock . " Mithros , Minoss , and Shakith , " he whispered . Daine frowned . Until now , the only one she 'd ever heard use that particular oath was Numair himself . " Arram ? " the man asked in a melodic voice . " Is that Arram Draper ? " Numair gaped at him . " Tristan Staghorn ? They told me you were still in Carthak , with Ozorne. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No , I felt too ? restricted , serving him . I 'm my own man now  --  have been for a year . " He and Numair shook hands . " Tristan , you know our guest ? " The lady rose from her chair and walked toward Numair , as graceful as a dancer . " Know him ? " replied Tristan . " My lady , this is Master Numair Salmalin , once of the university at Carthak , now resident at the court of Tortall . " Yolane offered Numair a hand , which he kissed . " How wonderful to find such beauty in an out-of-the-way place , " he said gallantly . " Does King Jonathan know the finest jewel in Tortall does not adorn his court ? " The lady smiled . " Only a man who lives at court could turn a compliment so well , Master Salmalin . " " But Tristan did n't call you that , " Lord Belden said coolly . " He called you Arram something . " " I was known as Arram Draper in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , yes  --  you wanted a majestic , sorcerous name when you got Master status . Then you had to change it , when Ozorne ordered your arrest . "  | Yolane and Belden looked sharply at Numair . " Wanted by the emperor of Carthak ? " the woman asked . " You must have clone something serious . " Numair blushed . " The emperor is very proprietary , Lady Yolane . He feels that if a mage studies at his university , the mage belongs to him . " He looked at Tristan . " I 'm rather surprised to see you here . You were the best war mage in your class . " War mage , Daine thought , startled . That 's who Numair said blasted the mines and killed the Riders . " I brought the emperor to see reason , " Tristan replied , looking at Daine . " I 'm sorry , little one  --  I did n't mean to be rude . Who might you be ? " " May I present my student ? " Numair asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sarrasri , once of ( ; alla . " Yolane 's lips twisted in a smirk . " Sarrasri ? " Daine turned beet red . The lady knew it meant " Sarra 's ( laughter , " and that only children born out of wedlock used a mother 's name . She lifted her head . She was proud she was named after Ma . " Are you a wizard ? " Maura 's question startled Daine : she 'd forgotten the girl was even in the room . " No , " she replied . " Not exactly . " A manservant entered and bowed . " Ladies and lords , if it pleases you , your meal awaits . " Numair offered his arm to Yolane . She accepted it and guided him toward a door in the back of the room . " Would you explain something ? We heard you were at the attack on Pirate 's Swoop last year . Was n't it from an imperial fleet ? I was surprised His Majesty did n't declare war on Carthak . " " He nearly did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barges , but the emperor claimed they were sold to pirates . As the king was unable to prove we were attacked by anyone other than pirates , he was forced to drop it . " Tristan offered Maura his arm with a mocking bow . The younger girl sniffed and took it . Belden , who appeared to spend much of his time in a brown study , followed them and left Daine to bring up the rear alone . For the first time in many ,  | many months , she felt like a complete outsider . She did not like the feeling . The dining hall was large enough to seat a household . Daine had been in many homes in the last year where servants and lords ate together , but tonight , at least , Dunlath 's nobles dined alone . Four other guests were already seated at a table placed lower and at an angle to the main board . They rose and bowed when the nobles entered . Daine saw Numair halt , dark brows knit in surprise . Tristan said , " Numair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gissa of Rachne ? " A man in a silk robe and a dark , striking woman bowed to Numair , who hesitated , then bowed in return . " They were on their way to the City of the Gods and stopped to pay me a visit . " " My lord 's hospitality is so good , we fear we shall be here forever , " the woman said in a heavily accented voice . " It is good to see you again , Arram . " " Not Arram anymore , " Tristan corrected her . " Numair Salmalin . " " That 's right . " Alamid had a high , cutting voice . " We 'd heard you were the Tortallan king 's pet mage . " Tristan introduced the remaining two men in plain tunics as Hasse Redfern and Tolon Gardiner , merchants . Yolane and Belden had taken their places at the main board , and waited with polite impatience for the introductions to end . A maid gave Daine a seat beside Maura , at a table across the room and opposite the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place next to Yolane . Daine was interested to see that Numair 's seat was so far from Alamid , Gissa , and the others that he would n't be able to talk to them during the meal . Her own place beside Maura was entirely out of the stream of conversation . If they strained , they could just hear what was said by the adults on the dais . " If you 're waiting for them to talk to us , you have a long wait , " Maura informed her at last . Daine came to herself with a jerk . It occurred to her that she was being rude . " I 'm sorry , " she apologized , and tasted her soup . It was cold .  | Maura correctly interpreted the face she made . " My sister does n't want servants eating here , as they did when our father was alive . She says the king does n't eat with his servants , so we wo n't , either . That made the servants angry , so they take their time bringing meals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She broke off a scrap of bread and fed it to him . When he finished , he whisked out of sight . " Why should the way the king eats decide how you take your meals here ? " " We 're his closest relatives  --  third cousins or something like that , " replied Maura , eating her soup . " Yolane says if he had n't married and had children , she might be queen today . If you 're from Galla , why do you live here ? And what was your name again ? " Daine looked at her dinner companion , really looked at her , and smiled . The girl 's brown eyes were large and frank under limp bangs , and freckles adorned her cheeks and pug nose . Perhaps to preserve her ivory skin Lady Yolane never went into the sun , but her sister was a different kind of female . " I 'm called Daine , for short , " she replied . " And it 's a fair long story , how I came to Tortall . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Maura . " She insists on having all the courses , just like at court . " The mouse had returned , with friends . The feel of their cold noses on her stockinged legs made Daine smother a giggle . " I keep telling her , if she likes court so much , why does n't she live there all year , like some nobles . She does n't take the hint . Uh  --  Daine , do n't jump or screech or anything , but there 's a mouse in your sleeve . " Daine looked . A pair of black button eyes peered up at her . " That 's hardly a safe place , " she commented . The mouse replied he liked it there . " Who are you talking to ? " asked Maura . Daine blushed . " The mouse , " she explained . " I understand what animals say , and they understand me . Oftentimes I forget that we are n't speaking as humans do , and I talk to them as I might to you or Numair . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cat sees you , there will be all sorts of trouble . "  | " No cats in the dining hall , " interrupted Maura . " Yolane hates ' em . " " I knew there was something about her I did n't like , " muttered Daine . Servants took the soup bowls , replacing them with plates laden with meat and vegetables . Daine was glad to see steam rise from their food , although none came from those that went to the head table . She mentioned it to Maura as she coaxed her mouse friend to sit beside her , rather than in her sleeve . " The servants like me , so they try to keep my food hot . It 's just hard with soup  --  it cools fast . " Daine hesitated , trying to decide how to ask her next question . While she thought , she continued to feed bread to the mice . " You two do n't seem like sisters , " she commented at last . " Half sisters , " Maura said . " Her mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She died a long time ago , and Father remarried when Yolane got engaged to Belden . She tells everyone my mother was a country nobody . " Daine frowned . " Forgive my saying so , Lady Maura , but your sister does n't sound like a nice person . " " She is n't , " was the matter-of-fact reply . " She cares about how old our family is and how close to the throne we are , not about taking care of Dunlath and looking after our people . And Belden 's as bad as she is . Father said he 's just a younger son , so he has a lot to prove . " Daine shook her head , thinking you could never tell with nobles . Sometimes they were normal humans , and sometimes they worried about the silliest things . Maura watched the mice for a moment . " I do n't understand . Do they all come up to you that way ? " " Yes . They like me , " Daine replied . " I like them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I get lonesome . She wo n't let me play with commoners . All my friends in the village think I 'm stuck-up now . " " Why should it matter who you play with ? " asked Daine . Go sit with her , she urged the mice silently , so Maura would n't think Daine felt sorry for her . She 's perfectly nice , you 'll see . " I do n't think it should matter to anyone , but she says I have to think of our house and our honor . " The girl turned a danger-  | ous shade of pink . " I care more than dhe does . She thinks it 's a big secret , but I know what 's going on with her and Tristan . Oh ! " She stared at her lap . A mouse stood there on his hind feet , looking her over . " Can I pet him ? Will he mind ? " " Gently , " Daine said . She felt sorry for Maura . From the look of things , no one seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They 're shy . If you feed him , he should stay with you . " Wo n't you ? she asked the mouse . If she feeds me , he replied . Please tell her I am ' partial to fruit . Humans seem to think all we eat is cheese . That 's boring after a while . Hiding a smile , Daine relayed his words to Maura , who proceeded to stuff him , and his friends . They had gone to sleep in her lap by the time the servants cleared the plates and a bard came in , carrying a lap harp . Taking a seat in front of the nobles , he tuned his instrument as the servants returned to find places around the walls . The bard played traditional songs for an hour or more . Long before he was done , Maura had gone to sleep . Daine barely listened . Watching the adults at the main table , she realized that here was the opportunity to do what lrokefang expected her to do , deliver his request for a halt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thought of giving such a message to these polished , self-assured humans . She also knew Brokefang would n't understand if she held back . Mockery and shame meant nothing to wolves . I wish they meant nothing to me , either , she thought , making up her mind as the bard ended his last song and left the room . Forcing herself to get up , she walked out into the open space in front of the dais . Numair looked at her , clearly puzzled . Then he guessed why she was there . He shook his head , trying to signal for her t o return to her seat , but Daine fixed her eyes on Dunlath 's lord and lady and ignored him . Yolane and Belden were deep in conversation . It was Tristan who saw Daine first . Breaking off his talk with Alamid and Gissa , he looked at Daine with a raised eyebrow , then smirked . Gently he tapped Belden on the shoulder . Numair was now pointing at Daine 's seat , giving her a clear order , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer to the pack ; she did .  | Belden called his wife 's attention to the girl in pink before them . Yolane 's brows snapped together . " What is it ? " she asked impatiently . Daine clenched her hands in the folds of her skirt . " Excuse me , my lord . My lady . I 've been asked to speak to you by the wolves of this valley . " " Wolves ? " asked Belden , looking haughty . " What can they say to anything ? " " Plenty , " the girl said . " They live here , too , you see . They take food out of these forests , and they drink from the streams . They told me when they came , this place was near perfect . " She knew her face was red by now . The huge room had gone completely silent . She 'd never felt so small , or so alone , in her life . " Then you began digging and cutting down trees . Mine trash has started to poison the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? And the digging and the lumbering is scaring the game out of the valley . " To her surprise , a rough voice in the rear of the hall called , " She 's right , about th ' game , at least . I tried to tell ye m'self , three weeks back . " Daine looked over her shoulder . She had forgotten that the huntsman , Tait , had come to hear the bard . She ventured a smile , and he winked . Drawing her breath , feeling better , she went on . " The Long Lake Pack asked me to tell you they want you to stop . If you do n't , they 'll do something drastic . " " How do you know this ? " Tristan 's voice was too even and sincere . His eyes danced with amusement . " Did the wolves come to you in a dream , perhaps , or ? " " She has wild magic , Tristan . " Numair came to stand with Daine , resting a hand on her shoulder and squeezing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Surely you do not yet insist ' wild magic ' is real , " scoffed Gissa . " You are too old to pursue fables . " " It is no fable , " Numair replied . " You and the Carthaki university people are like the blind man who claims sight can not exist , because he lacks it . " " We lose sight of the point of Mistress Sarraori'e argument . " There was a strangled note in Yolane 's voice . " A pack of four-  | legged beasts wants us to stop mining . And cutting down trees . " " That 's right , " Daine said , bracing herself for what she knew was coming . " And  --  if we do n't " ? the choked sound was thicker than ever in the woman 's throat ? " they 'll do something  --  drastic . Do you know what ? No , of course you do n't . Perhaps  --  per-haps " ? the strangling began to escape her now , as giggles ? " they will piddle on the castle walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tristan suggested , grinning . " Has she been mad for long ? " Yolane asked Numair . " You laugh at your peril , " Numair warned . " This is a very different breed of wolf you 're dealing with , Lady Yolane . " Yolane began to laugh , and laugh hard . Briefly she fought to get herself under control . " Maybe they 'll bury their bones in my wardrobe ! " she said , and began to laugh again . Tristan smirked . " Suppose for a moment  --  just a moment ? that you are right . Do you think we ca n't deal with a pack of wolves ? Brute creation is in this world to serve man  --  not the other way around . This valley is ruled by humans . " Daine could n't believe what she had heard . " Is that what you really think animals are here for ? " " No . That is what I know they are for . Men do not shape their concerns for the benefit of wild beasts , my dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are a foolish child . Master Salmalin has indulged you too much . Why , in Mithros 's name , should I care in the least about the tender feelings of a pack of mangy , flea-bitten curs ? " " Think selfishly , " Daine said , trying to make these arrogant two-leggers see what she meant . " You ca n't go on this way . Soon you will have no forests to get wood from or to hunt game in . You poison water you drink and bathe and fish in . Even if you keep the farms , they wo n't be enough to feed you if the rest of the valley 's laid waste . You 'll starve . Your people will starve  --  unless you buy from outside the valley , and that 's fair epensive . You 'll ruin Dunlath . " Yolane 's eyes glittered . " Who are you to judge me in my own castle ? "  | " Daine , " Numair said quietly . Daine looked at Yolane , Belden , and Tristan . They stared back at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they wished . " Well , I tried , " she muttered . Numair bowed . " My lord , my lady  --  with your good will , we take our leave . " As they walked out , Daine glanced at Maura . The girl had awakened and now watched Daine with a worried frown . Daine smiled , but her lips trembled a little . She hoped Maura would n't think she was crazy . Servants left the dining hall ahead of them to fetch their cloaks and to bring their horses . Within minutes they were trotting across the causeway . " I 'm sorry I did n't keep my mouth shut when you wanted , " she said , trying to keep a pleading note out of her voice . " I had to speak . Brokefang would n't understand if we came back and said we did n't say anything to them . " He reached over to pat her back . " I know . Please calm down . You are n't the kind of girl who plunges without thinking . I wish I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkness covered her blush . It was the highest compliment he had ever paid her . " But you do n't plunge without thinking , " she protested . " You mean you have n't seen me do so . What , pray , was entering that castle tonight ? If I were more cautious ? Enough . What 's done is done . " Reaching the innyard , they gave their mounts to the only hostler still up , then went to their rooms . " Good night , " he said cheerfully . " I 'll see you in the morning . " Her door closed behind her , Daine used a glowstone from her belt-purse to find her candle , which she lit . Kitten , sprawled on the bed , peeped drowsily . " You prob'ly would 've hated it , " Daine told her , shedding her clothes . Hanging them up instead of leaving them on the floor , a habit she 'd learned in months of living in the Riders ' barracks , she then slipped into her nightshirt . " The little girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daine shook her head as she climbed under the blanket . Kitten , listening , chirped a question . Though she was too young to hear or to answer in mind-speech as older immortals  | did , talking to her was never a problem . Kitten understood Common better than some humans they had met . Daine was glad this was so , since from all she had learned in months of study , Kitten would be an infant for thirty years . " Well , they look nice , but they 're cold and proud . And something 's wrong . Maura says this mage from Carthak is canoodling with her sister Lady Yolane , she is . " Daine yawned . " If Lord Belden knows , he does n't seem to care . Put out the light , Kit , there 's a girl . " Kitten whistled , and the candle went out . Muttering softly , she curled up with her back against Daine . Within seconds they were asleep . She was dreaming that she ran with the pack , the scent of elk full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her long skull : " Daine . Daine . " Wolf body whirling , jaws ready to snap , she realized she was in bed , waking up . A gentle hand on her shoulder tugged her upright . For a brief moment she saw as a wolf saw , with grays and blacks and white the sole colors of her vision . The shadowy figure over her , lit by pale fire , doubled , then steadied back into one form . It was Numair . He had lit no candles ; instead , the shimmer of his magic filled the room with a dim glow . She felt as if she had n't slept . " What 's the hour ? " she asked , yawning . " Just after the midnight watch . " His voice was so quiet it was n't even a whisper , but she heard it clearly . " Pack . We 're I caving . " She blinked , wondering if she still dreamed . " Leaving ? But ? " " Not here , " he ordered . " I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of bed and did as she was told . Within minutes her saddlebags were ready and she was dressed . Numair poked his head through the inner door , which stood open once more , and beckoned for her and Kitten to follow . He left the saddling of Spots , Mangle , and Cloud to her . She did it quietly , not wanting to rouse the hostlers . Kitten went into her carry-pack , an open saddlebag on Mangle that allowed her to see everything as she rode . At the last minute  | Numair gave Daine a handful of rags , and motioned for her to cover their mounts ' feet , to muffle the sound of their shoes on the streets . " Did you leave money for our shot ? " she asked as she held Spots for Numair to mount . " With a good tip over that , and a note of apology . " He got himself into the saddle , a process she could never watch without gritting her teeth , and motioned for her to mount up . She did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wants silence over speed , I think . It is just as well , the patient gelding replied , passing the inn 's gate with Daine and Cloud close behind . He is so tense , I think if I trotted , he would fall off . What 's the matter ? He 'll tell us , the girl promised . Do what you can to make him less tense . I am a riding horse , not a god , was Spots 's answer . When they reached the trees where the road along the lakeshore crossed the river that flowed down from the western pass , Numair dismounted . Kneeling on the northern side of the crossing , he scratched a hole in the road , put something in it , and covered it over , patting the earth down firmly . Walking to the southern branch of the road , he performed the same curious rite . " If you 're leaving an offering to the crossroad god , his shrine is over there . " Daine pointed to the little niche where the god 's statue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dusting his hands . He bowed to the small shrine . " No offense meant . " Remounting , he guided Spots onto the track that led west , and beckoned for Daine to ride beside him . " What 's all this ? " she asked . " Usually you give warning if we have to skip out in the middle of the night . " " I wanted things to seem normal when we got back to the inn , in case someone was listening . We have to get out of here and warn King Jonathan , but I ca n't send a message from under this shield . Even if I were to succeed , Tristan and his friends would know of it . " " And I guess you do n't want them running off before we can get help . " " Exactly . Whatever is going on at Dunlath is big . Anything in which Tristan Staghorn is involved is a danger to the kingdom . "  | " But he said he did n't work for the emperor anymore . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplished liar . " Hearing iron control in his voice , Daine shivered . It took a great deal to anger Numair Salmalin . She would not give a half copper for the well-being of someone who did make him angry . " Then why let us go ? Surely he knew when he saw you that there 'd be trouble . " " He let us go because he dumped enough nightbloom powder in my wine to keep me asleep for a century . As far as he knows , I drank it . " " Did you ? " He smiled mockingly . " Of course not . Those years of working sleight-of-hand tricks in every common room and village square between Carthak and Corus were n't wasted . The wine ended up on the floor , under the table . " " He should 've known you 'd see the potion . " " Not particularly . When we were students , I had no skill in the detection of drugs or poisons . I knew nothing practical . People are impressed that I am a black robe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover esoterica and not much else . Yes , I can change a stone to a loaf of bread , if I want to be ill for days and if I do n't care that there will be a corresponding upheaval elsewhere in the world . Much of the practical magic I have learned I acquired here , in Tortall . From the king , in fact . " " But if it 's just Tristan shielding this place , ca n't you break through ? Oh , wait  --  you think those other two wizards are helping him . " He smiled . " There were five mages in that banquet hall . Tristan called Masters Redfern and Gardiner merchants , but if t hey are , it is only as a cover occupation . They have the Gift , too . " Daine guessed , " Another thing Tristan does n't know you can tell ? " The man nodded . " From the way the others defer to him , he is in charge of what is transpiring here . That means this affair is the emperor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only Ozorne can tell him where to bite . " " Nice , " growled Daine . " Then Tristan did for the Ninth Riders ? "  | " I 'm afraid so , magelet . It is probable those missing soldiers met the same fate as well . " " He 's got a lot to answer for , " she snapped . " And that emperor . But why here ? Why take an interest in Dunlath , of all places ? " " That 's an excellent question . I would like to have it answered . Ozorne does nothing unless there is something in it for him . What could Dunlath offer the Emperor Mage ? " A half-familiar whisper made Daine look around , then up . Suddenly she felt exposed on the riverbank . " Where can we get under cover ? " " I see trees over there ? " Mangle , Spots , the trees , she ordered silently . Fast ! The horses leaped forward . Numair almost fell before he grabbed his saddle horn . I thought we broke him of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to his mount as their group hid under the trees . I thought so , too , replied Spots . Dismounting , the girl went forward until she could see the sky . A pair of odd shapes reeled overhead , outlined by moonlight , their presence an unpleasant shadow in her mind . It took a moment to identify what she saw : bat wings , spread wide to lift a body not made for flight . Long , wedge-shaped heads craned , searching the ground below . Only when the great creatures gave up and flew north did she see them clearly against the just-past-full moon . They were horses , and something was wrong with their feet . She had met winged horses . They were shy creatures who tended to keep out of human sight . She sensed them as she could other immortals , and their presence in her mind was never unpleasant . Returning to Numair and the horses , she asked softly , " If a winged horse is an evil immortal  --  if something 's wrong with one  --  would it have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " The name is a slurring of ' horse-hawk . ' They have a carnivore 's fangs , and claws , not hooves . Their eyes are set forward in their skulls , as a predator 's are . " " Goddess bless , " she whispered , her skin prickling . " That 's awful . "  | " Is that what you sensed ? Hurroks ? " " Yes , " she said , remounting Cloud . " And I did once before , too . I think it was the first night we were at the wolves ' meeting place . " Listening to the animal voices all around , she heard familiar ones . She called to them , and they agreed to come . " Let 's wait a moment , " she suggested . " The pack 's near . " " Daine , I want to be out of this valley by dawn . " " Do n't worry , " she told him . " I said they 're close , did n't I ? We can ride a little more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  stop . " He held up a hand , as if he listened for something . " They know we 're gone , " he said at last . " They 're searching along the net . " A lump formed in her throat . " What do we do ? " He smiled . " Unveil our insurance . " He raised his hands . Black fire that sparkled with points of white spilled out of his palms , arching up and around him and Spots , who shook his head . I wish he would n't do this when he 's on me , the gelding said nervously . It 's really very upsetting . ) aine could see his point , but told him , If you 're a wizard 's horse , you should be used to it . And you are a wonderful mount for him  --  patient , willing , gentle . I know he could n't manage without you . Spots blew through his nose , pleased by the compliments . Wrapped in a shroud of glittering fire , Numair pointed to e @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a ightning bolt , crackling as it flew downhill . Shifting his aim to e south , he loosed a second bolt . " What was that ? " Daine asked , startled . " Those things I buried at the crossroads ? Once activated , I just did , they release simulacra of a man shrouded in my il't , riding hard on the road . Now Tristan has three of me to base , and the ones that ride north and south will appear much ore like the real me than I do . " But they will see Daine with only one of you , Cloud pointout . The girl passed it on . The look on Numair 's face was one of smug satisfaction . The magical cloak on my simulacra is very large , and very sloppy , enough to cover more than one person . Just the thing a  | sheltered academic like me would have for concealment , since I 'm unused to fieldwork . " " But they know you , " Daine argued . " They know you handle immortals for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned something practical by now ? " " Magelet , one thing I have learned is that humans cling to their first knowledge of you , particularly if they have no experience of you once you 've changed . Tristan , Alamid , and Gissa knew me in Carthak , when I was a book-bound idiot . " Daine shook her head . She thought her friend placed too much trust in the enemy mages ' stupidity . There was a yip nearby , and the pack streamed out of the trees , Brokefang in the lead . They gathered around the horses , tails wagging . Kitten stuck her head out of her pack and chirped to Russet . Mangle held still unhappily as the wolf braced himself against the cob 's withers to lick Kitten 's nose . Where are you going ? Brokefang asked . Why are the horses ' feet covered ? " The humans are up to no good , " Daine told her friend , speaking aloud for Numair 's benefit . " We have to warn the king , and for that we must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valley . " Brokefang backed up so he could see both Daine and Numair . You are leaving ? " To alert the king , " Daine reassured him . " He will stop the mining and the tree cutting . " I do not know your king . I know only you . You said that you would help us . " But I am helping , " Daine protested . The other wolves , looking worried , sat down to listen . " We 're going to get help . " That is help for two-leggers . You are needed here . " Daine , we have to go , " said the man quietly . She hesitated . There was something odd in Brokefang 's eyes . Dismounting , she knelt before the chief wolf , tangling her hands in his ruff . Eyes closed , she opened up her mind to his , and his alone , listening hard to the tumble of ideas and images in his skull . Brokefang was afraid . New thoughts came thick and fast now , more every day , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken him this way before , after the girl-who-is-Pack left , in the time when men drove them from their home . Then he had no one to turn to , no one in the pack who would understand and explain these thoughts . He had borne them alone for months , until they slowed to a trickle . The trickle he could bear . Then the girl had come again , and new thoughts roared through his brain like a flash flood . " Poor Brokefang , " she whispered , rubbing her friend 's ears . " I do n't s'pose wolves get headaches , but if they did , you 'd have u grand one . " " Daine , those simulacra wo n't last after dawn ! " hissed Numair . She looked at him . He was keeping an eye on the road to the village and trying not to grip Spots 's reins too tightly . She had to make a decision , and make it fast . He did n't need her to do what was necessary  --  she would only distract him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who could help this wolf . Going to Mangle , she undid Kitten 's pack and the pack that held her things . " I ca n't go with you , " she said as she worked . " Brokefang needs me . " This is no time for sentiment ! Here you 're in danger until help comes ! " " And they are n't ? " she asked , indicating the pack . " They 're changed because of me , Numair . Me . I did n't even know I had magic when this pack saved my life , but my head must have been wide open , and all the magic spilled out . Now they need help to deal with what happened to them when I did n't know anything . I ca n't let them down , Numair . I 'm sorry . " " So you 'll let me down ? " He was so worked up that Spots was shifting position nervously . " What if something delays my return ? " She smiled at him . " You know I can fend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've my crossbow . I 'll be fine . " He drew a deep breath . " I could make you come with me . " She knew only grave concern for her would make him voice a threat , so she bore him no grudge . " Maybe you could and maybe you could n't , but while we found out , Tristan would see you doing something your whatchumacallems were n't . " " Simulacra , " he corrected automatically .  | " Whatever . " He stared down at her , eyes shadowed . " You are too stubborn for your own good , " he said at last . " That 's what Ma told me , all the time . " Smiling , she added , " If it was you in my shoes , you 'd say the same . " He sighed . " Very well . Stay on the mountainsides . Keep moving . Leave the forts alone , the castle , the village  --  everything , understand ? Otherwise I will chain you in the worst dungeon I can find when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yes , " she told him . " Now scoot . The sooner you leave , the sooner you can return . " Mangle , go with him , she added . It will get you away from the wolves for a day or two . Thank you , the cob said gratefully . He trotted off , heading for the western pass , and Spots turned to follow . " Wait , " Numair said . " How will I find you , when I return ? " " Spots will know . Please leave . You still have a ride to the pass . " The man reached a hand down , and she gave him hers . He squeezed it gently . " Be careful . Stay out of sight . " " I 'll be fine , " she assured him . Spots trotted quickly after Mangle , muffled hooves thudding on the ground . Daine watched them go , feeling a bit forlorn .  | He must n't worry , Brokefang said . The pack will keep you safe . " I know , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she added more cheerfully , looking at the wolves ' faces . " All they do is slow me down and screech when they see my friends . Most humans , anyway . " I like the stork-man , protested Brokefang . So do I , added Short Snout . Fleetfoot , Russet , and Battle yipped agreement . He is a good pack leader for you , Brokefang went on . Humans are like wolves . We all need a pack . He looked at ( ' loud , and added , Or a herd . " Not me , " the girl said , fastening her things to Cloud 's saddle . " I can hunt alone . " No , Brokefang said . It is not just for food that you need a pack . It is for warmth , and the pack song . The wolf who sings alone is not happy .  | We could chat all night , Cloud put in tartly . Or we can get away from here . The first thing the humans will do when they can not find Numair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ride , Russet said . Kitten can ride on me , if she promises not to scratch . The young dragon chirped and tried to climb out of her carry-sack . Daine helped her , and placed her on Russet . Gently Kitten gripped his fur in all four paws , balancing herself comfortably . Daine looked at the odd picture they made , shook her head , and mounted Cloud . Brokefang trotted to the head of the line . The pack followed in single file , with Daine and Cloud bringing up the rear . They reached the wolves ' meeting place shortly before dawn . Frostfur and the pups were there to greet them . As the wolves celebrated the reunion of the pack , Daine unsaddled Cloud and rubbed her down . The girl noticed that Kitten , still on Russet 's back , ended up as part of the ceremony by accident . To her amusement , and Kitten 's pleasure , the pups waved their tails slightly at the dragon this time , even if they still would not approach her . Once Cloud was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedroll , though she was n't drowsy yet . Sharp Nose and Frolic took the pups for a hunt . Most of the others settled around Daine , while Frostfur lay at the pond 's edge , within earshot . Kitten stretched out by the girl and went promptly to sleep . Now , Brokefang said , did you speak to the two-leggers ? " Yes . They wo n't do anything . They laughed at me . I told you they would . " Why ? Longwind wanted to know . What is there about you that is funny ? " They do n't see me the same way you do . To them I 'm only a girl child . They think they know all there is to know , " Daine told them . " They think they do n't have to listen to me . Would you try to tell an eagle how to hunt ? " No more than eagles would tell a wolf how to hunt , replied Battle . " To the castle lords and Tristan , I am a wolf telling an eagle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquired Russet . Did you say they are driving off game and killing fish ? " Yes . They do n't care . They say they can use the valley as they please . " I did n't think you would be much help , Frostfur said tartly . What are you good for , except to talk to ? That stung . Daine glared at Brokefang 's mate . " I 'd like to see you do any better , Mistress Know-it-all . " Frostfur bit a flea that was nibbling her backside and did not answer . " The king will help , " Daine said to Brokefang , wanting him to believe and wait for aid , not try something on his own . " The two-leggers are up to something bad here , and he will set it right . " I do not know of kings , the wolf replied . To me they are just t wo-leggers . Exactly , Fleetfoot said . We have yet to see two-leggers fix the harm they do . To Daine she added , You are not a two-legger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Broke fang 's uncle , he was the oldest of the pack , with gray hairs in the black fur of his muzzle . You were right to act , Brokefang . I questioned you , until you made me submit . I was wrong . At least now we have made a beginning . Daine sat up , suddenly wary . " What d' you mean , you 've ' made a beginning ' ? " It was fun . That was Russet , whose eyes shone with delight . You should have been with us . Can I show her ? he asked Brokefang . Please ? Short Snout yipped agreement ; Longwind stirred the dust with his tail . Frostfur sat up , watching Daine with an odd , smug look in her amber eyes . Very well , Brokefang consented . Russet yapped gleefully and trotted into the reeds . He returned dragging something that looked like a big stick . Do not worry , Brokefang told Daine as Russet approached her bedroll . We did the same thing as with the sheep we ate , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped the " stick " on the ground , tail waving . His trophy was an ax  --  one of the big ones used by  | woodsmen to cut down trees . Daine touched the handle , just to confirm it was real . " How ? " she croaked , her throat dry . Grabbing the water bag , she drank , then put it aside . " How many of these do you have ? Just this ? " Oh , no , Battle replied . We took all the ones we could find in the tree cutter 's camp . It was safe , Fleetfoot assured the girl . Having traveled with Daine and Numair , she knew the odd things these friends insisted be done in the name of safety . The humans do n't den where they cut trees . They den with other two-leggers , by the lake . Only the forest People saw us  --  they would n't interfere . Daine lurched to her feet . " Where 's the rest ? " Russet led her to the spot in the reeds . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she had gone to the castle , the wolves had stolen fourteen big axes , and five twoman saws . " Goddess bless , " she squeaked , and sat down hard . In all the years she had associated with animals , before and after she got control of her wild magic , she had never seen an animal do something like this . This was thinking about the future . This was knowing tools were separate from the men who wielded them . We stopped the cutting , Brokefang said . Without these , humans wo n't destroy more trees . They wo n't make the noise that frightens deer and elk . " You do n't understand . They 'll come after you , just as they did back home . " Only the hunter , the one with the dog pack , can track wolves , Longwind said . " Tait , " mumbled Daine . " His name is Tait . " None of the others can track us , Longwind went on . And Brokefang has a plan for Tait . Short Snout grinned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night caught up with Daine . It was dawn ; she was exhausted . Getting to her feet , she dusted her bottom and went to her bedroll . " Do n't do anything until I wake , " she ordered as she crawled into it . " Not one thing , understand ? We 'll talk later . "  | Do n't be upset , Fleetfoot advised , curling up on the girl 's Free side . Brokefang knows what to do . " That 's what frightens me , " Daine muttered , and her eyes closed . As she slept , she dreamed . Ma tended flowers , golden hair pinned up , out of the way . A man with antlers rooted in his curly brown hair watched . Leaning on the garden wall , he was a handsome , muscular creature dressed in a loincloth and nothing else . When he moved , hints of green showed in his tan skin . I ler mother looked at him , shading her eyes against the sun as her lips moved . The man laughed silently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she could have been someplace real , watching from the garden gate : A bluejay screamed , Thief thief ! The dream ended and Daine opened her eyes , feeling very confused . A year before she 'd had a similar vision of her mother and the stranger . What did it mean ? Were the vision , and this dream , Ma 's way of saying she was at peace in the Realms of the Dead ? What part did the horned man play ? From all Daine had heard , the Black God 's domain was reserved for humans , and he was no human . For that matter , what she had just experienced was too vivid for a dream  --  her dreams were bits and pieces of tales that seldom made sense and never felt real . I say she ought to do it , if she is Pack . The snarling voice was Frostfur 's . Why leave the pups to search and fail to bring down game four times out of five when she is here ? Daine sat up . The pack stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead-the-hunt ceremony . Call the game to us , Frostfur ordered , coming over to Daine , ears forward and tail up , to force the girl to submit to her as other females of the pack did . Bring us a nice , fat buck . Why must we take chances when you are here , getting your smell all over our camp ? Either you are Pack , and that means you obey me , or you are not . Obey ! " No , " Daine said , meeting the female 's eyes squarely . Frostfur 's hackles rose . She drew her upper lip back , baring strong teeth .  | Daine crouched . " Do I tell you how to deal with the pack females ? " she demanded . " I let you rule your way , and you do not tell me how to handle other People . If you were n't a wicked , nasty vixen , you never would 've mentioned it . " Frostfur growled , a low , grating noise that started at the bottom of her deep chest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make me show you what else I learned while I was away , " Daine warned . " You wo n't like it . " Her eyes locked onto the wolf 's , and held them . The moment stretched out like the tension on a bowstring . Frostfur broke the staring contest first . She wheeled and plunged into the reeds . Hidden , she called to Brokefang , She will turn on us ! The pups whined , looking from Brokefang to the plants that hid their mother . It 's all right , the pack leader said . Go on . We will bring you meat . Leaper yipped in apology/agreement , and followed her mother . The other pups and the pack females did the same . Fleetfoot was last . She turned in front of the reeds , looked at Daine , and whined . The girl smiled . " It 's all right , " she told the brown-and-gray female . " We 've just never gotten along . " Fleetfoot yipped in sad agreement , and vanished into the reeds . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her cheek . Will you hunt with us ? Daine smiled . " No , thanks . I have provisions . " Is there cheese ? Short Snout wanted to know . Russet says it tastes good . " I 'll give you some when you return , " Daine promised . " And you 'll get round and fat , like a sheep . " Short Snout bared his teeth in a silent wolf laugh . We hunt , Brokefang said , and trotted off , the other males behind him . Soon the adult females , with the exception of Frostfur and Battle , left the reeds and followed . They had been gone only a moment when Frostfur went after them . Daine smiled . It seemed that a new skill , like sulking , could n't stand up to the demands of Frostfur 's stomach . Kitten tugged at Daine 's belt-pouch . The girl kept flint and steel there , and this was Kitten 's way to say it was breakfast  | time . " I s'pose you 're right , " she told the dragon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Working quickly , she built a mound of tinder and wood in the firepit and set it to blazing . Looking up , she saw that the pups , Battle , Cloud , and Kitten had each brought a good-sized branch for her fire . " You 're learning new things too quick for me , " she said . " Thank you . I think there 's a sausage in my packs that might Iced us . " You do n't have to give me any , Cloud said with a shudder . I dlo n't know what meat eaters see in that stuff . Once she had fed everyone , Daine went to clean up . Not wanting to bathe in the pond , where soap would linger in water drunk by the wolves , she used a stream nearby . On her return to the clearing she found the pups , Cloud , and Kitten fast asleep . It was warm for autumn . Battle was cooling off , lying belly-down on the damp earth by the pond . " You know the thing I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I did it with Brokefang and Russet . " When you ride inside them , Battle answered . Russet said it was fun . Do you want to try it with me ? " If you do n't mind , " the girl said . Very well . Battle closed her eyes and rested her chin on her feet . All I ask is that we not run around . It is too hot . Daine grinned . " Fair enough . " Sitting next to Battle , she first listened around her , checking for any sense that enemies were close . All she heard was the normal chatter of forest dwellers : squirrels , birds , and the like . Feeling safe , she focused on Battle . The joining happened faster than ever . Settling into the female 's mind , she felt as if she belonged there . Perhaps ( ' loud had been right , and she was practically a wolf . Battle checked the pups with one drowsy eye . They were hardly pups anymore . Soon they would hunt with the pack . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over them was more fun when they were small and fuzzy . Gazing at each of the young ones through Battle 's eyes , I ) aine realized that even in daylight the wolf had no color vision . On the other hand , she hardly needed it . The marks on  | each pup 's face and body were clearer to Battle 's eyes than Daine 's , and she could tell each pup 's scent from the others with the wolf 's vivid sense of smell . Battle inhaled and identified the scents that came into her nose for Daine . She inhaled again , enjoying Daine 's fascination with odors as if she too smelled them for the first time . Eventually the girl returned to her own body . Heavy-eyed , she crawled on all fours to her bedroll , turned three times against her rumpled blankets , and went to sleep curled up in a tight knot . When she woke , the late sun shone through treetops as shadows collected below . She had slept through the wolves ' return . Brokefang was sprawled beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She touched him to ask , May I join with you ? Brokefang opened one sleepy eye . Do I have to wake up ? I do n't think so . The eye closed . Then go ahead . She was learning how to listen , to bring herself speedily into his mind . Now , as with Battle , she made the changeover quickly . With Battle fresh in her memory , she saw how different the pack leader 's mind was , not in terms of size , but of space . Numair had said , in an anatomy lesson , that humans used little of their brains . She knew that animals were the same , though they used more of what lay between their ears than humans did . For Brokefang the difference was that each nook and cranny in his skull was packed with information and ideas . He knew he would die , as would his pack mates and children . He saw humans not as simple threats , but as creatures in their own right , living in packs , with thoughts and plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animals he preyed on had lives and customs of their own , different from wolves ' but with meaning for the creatures involved . It was a rushing-in of knowledge that he frantically tried to keep up with in his waking hours , with only limited degrees of success . She withdrew hastily , and found her cheeks were damp with tears . Sitting up  --  wincing because she had gone stiff  --  she wiped her eyes on her sleeve . For a moment she thought there was something longer and hairier where her nose should be , but when she touched her face , it was gone , if it had even existed .  | What 's wrong ? asked Cloud . Why were you crying ? Daine jumped . She had n't known the pony was watching . I Feel terrible , she confessed to her oldest friend . I feel as if I took something from him . As if I ruined his innocence , and yours , and it looks as if I 'm ruining the rest of the pack , too . Maybe they wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you will be happy doing normal People things anymore . So you picked up that stupid human habit of blaming yourself for things you did n't or could n't control , retorted Cloud dryly . You did not force Brokefang to care for your wounds that night , any more than you forced me to bite you and get your blood on my teeth all those times . Just be careful who you bleed on in future . Now , come and get these burrs out of my tail . That will give you something useful to do . Daine blew her nose . Cloud 's horse sense spoke to her own common sense , as it always had . You are n't a god , she told herself sternly , rubbing the tip of her itchy nose until it was pink . Coarse , dark hairs fell off it into her lap . Where had they come from ? She looked at her pony and smiled . If you 're so smart , then you do n't need me , she told the mare . Cloud glared and stamped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet . " I 'm coming , I 'm coming , " she said , picking her way through the slumbering wolves . Kitten , with a chortle , came to help as well . Daine hunted in the gathering twilight , bringing down a pair of pheasants . As she cooked them , the pack , including the pups , revisited the carcass of the deer they had slain to finish it off . When they returned , they slept again . After a few games of stone , paper , knife with Kitten , Daine joined them . It was a bad night . She tossed and turned , dreaming she heard a low , nasty hum in the sky overhead . When she woke and listened she heard nothing , and her clothes were sweatsoaked . The hum began once more when she went back to sleep . Fireballs exploded without warning inside her eyelids , startling her awake . Once her eyes were open , she saw nothing . If hurroks or Stormwings passed overhead in the dark , she could- n't sense them . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After the third wake-up , she crawled in with Daine ,  | something she had n't done for months . She slept better afterward , but the girl could feel her shiver all night long . The wolves moaned and twitched with disagreeable dreams . Twice they woke Daine with their growling and snapping at invisible enemies . Daine gave up at dawn and went to bathe and dress . When she came back , the wolves were assembling for another hunt . They ate often when they could , and a single deer was not enough for nine adults and five rapidly growing youngsters . We do not need to leave one of the pack behind , Brokefang was telling his mate . Daine can look after the pups . She is not a wolf , but her weapons serve her as claws and fangs do us . And you know yourself that Cloud will fight . Let all the adults hunt today . Frostfur 's head drooped . She was tired and did n't want to argue with him . To Daine she said , Old White help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old White ? " she asked , trying to remember if she 'd heard the name . Old White and Night Black are the first wolf and his mate , Brokefang said . They lead the First Pack . And it is unwise to threaten Daine with Old White , he told his mate . If he comes , he will nip you for using his name lightly . Frostfur bared a fang in wolf disdain , and the pack left the clearing . The pups whined . They were too big to enjoy being left behind . " You 'll get your chance , " Daine told them . " You have to build up your strength and your wind before you can keep up with the pack . " Her listeners were not cheered . They remained edgy , constantly fighting with one another . They teased Cloud , nipping at her flanks , until she placed a gentle , but still firm , kick on Silly 's ribs . Chaser bit Kitten a little too hard , and got a scratch on the nose as his reward . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once more ? , " Daine warned . Leaper yapped crossly and raced through a trail that led east , out of the clearing . The other pups followed .  | " Goddess bless ! " Daine went after them , tracking them down the path and planning dreadful things to do when she caught them . " I should have known any pups of Frostfur 's would be a pain , " she muttered , coming to open ground . Here the rocks that hid the wolf camp ended . Between them and the forest below was a meadow with grass so tall that any young wolves could play hide and pounce . The stream where Daine bathed was near : she went to it and scrubbed her cheeks . As she did , she heard a sour note among the animal voices around her : someone nearby was dying . Looking around , she found her patient in a tree on the far edge of the open grass . He sat in a knothole , shivering . Walking down the gentle slope of the meadow , she sent love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come , tree brother , " she called , holding up her hands . " Let me look at you . " The squirrel opened runny eyes . He was too sick to talk . The source of his illness was plain : deep gashes on his back oozed fluid . He was far gone in fever , and his breathing was wet and difficult . As he ventured from his perch he missed his grip , his claws too weak to hang on . Daine caught him as he fell . She sat , cradling the animal against her shirt . " You pups stay right here , " she called . " And play quiet for a minute or two . Poor little man , " she whispered . She leaned back , using the squirrel 's tree as support , and closed her eyes . With her magic she looked deep into the body cradled in her arms . The copper light that was the squirrel 's life force flickered . Goddess , do n't let me fail , she thought , and went to work . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire and poured it in to dry them . The animal 's breathing cleared . Next she tended his blood , scorching out illness as she wove through his veins . Turning to his wounds , she burned off all the infection . The flesh was laid open down to the bone , the edges as clean as if cut by a knife . Stormwing ? she asked the squirrel , picturing one for him . Yes , he replied . One landed on my branch , without any warning at all .  | She nodded , unsurprised . Why would a being that fed on human misery care if it hurt an animal ? Just a little more , she told her patient , and concentrated , knitting sliced muscle together . Next came the fat layer , dangerously thin in this squirrel because fever had burned much of it off . Coaxing and pushing with her power , she built it up until it covered the newly healed muscle . Last came new skin to seal his body again . Finished , she relaxed , enjoying the fresh air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes , the squirrel was searching her pockets for edibles . I 'm hungry , he explained . Sunflower seeds in my jacket pocket , she told him . The squirrel thrust his head in and began to eat . Looking for her charges , Daine found them seated nearby , watching her and the squirrel with interest . " Where 's Kit ? " she asked . The pups looked past her , and the girl craned around the edge of the tree that supported her back . Several yards away Kitten sat on her hindquarters , staring down the slope of the ground under the trees . Her skin was changing from pale blue to a brilliant , hard-edged silver . It brightened until she actually began to glow . Opening her mouth , she shrieked . Terrified , the squirrel raced up into the safety of his tree . Daine lurched to her feet . Never had she heard Kitten make such a sound , and she was afraid she knew why the dragon did so now . Ignored during her concentration on healing , a warning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magical ear . The deep sound was so ugly it made her teeth ache . " Back to the meadow ! " she yelled at the pups . " Hide ! " She ran for Kitten , who had yet to stop screeching . Stooping to grab the dragon , she saw what Kitten was looking at , and froze . Over a dip in the ground appeared one clawed hand . Another hand followed . The claws were bright silver , the mark of an immortal . They groped for a hold on the flat of the ground ; finding one , they gripped , digging into the earth . The creature 's head topped the rise . It was reptilian , pointed , with slits for nostrils and deep-set , shadowed eyes . It swung to the right , quite slowly , then to the left . At last it returned to the center of its field of vision : Daine and Kitten .  | Daine was cold  --  very cold . Her breath , and Kitten 's , formed small clouds in the air . Neither of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stranger , as if an entire winter night had been crushed into a few moments . The monster dragged its long , heavy body over the ridge , taking its time . Its skin was beaded in colors that ranged from emerald to fiery gold , passing through bronze and jade green on the way . Daine shuddered : in mortal animals , such bright markings usually meant the wearer was poisonous . Slowly it advanced , moving right fore and left hind foot , then left fore and right hind , in a gait that was half skip , half waddle . The tail that dragged behind it bore a knobbed bone rattle , like that of certain desert snakes . When it had crossed nearly half the distance between them , the creature opened its mouth and hissed . Its teeth were silver , curved and sharp , predator teeth . Worse , when it hissed , two fangs dropped down on bone hinges . At the tip of one a small drop of silvery liquid formed , grew large , fell . A shaggy body flew out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but jaws that could make quick work of elk hone barely dimpled the green creature 's flesh . The pup she 'd named Runt snarled defiance as he hung on . Leaper grabbed the creature 's other forepaw . Chaser and the pup named Berry darted at the immortal 's sides , yapping furiously , while Silly went for the rattle on its tail . Silly went flying , the rattle broken off ' in his mouth . Now the immortal used its tail for balance as it rose onto its hind legs . Upright it was barely taller than Daine , though powerfully huilt . With quick , efficient blows of its head it knocked away the four who attacked from the front . Kitten darted forward when the creature 's eyes left hers . When it swung at her , she seized its paw and bit down , hard . The wolves ' jaws had not marked the thing , but the bite of another immortal had more effect . Dark blood welled up to drip on the leaves , hissing where it struck the ground . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mountain laurel ten yards away . That gave Daine the angry strength to break its hold on her mind . She flung herself to one side and yanked a large rock  | from the earth . " Pick on someone your own size ! " she yelled , and threw . The stone hit the creature 's muzzle and shattered . Daine rolled , scrabbling for another rock , but the immortal was on her . Seizing her by the back of her shirt , it lifted her clear of the ground . She had no way to avoid its eyes . Its power caught and held her again . Details fixed themselves in her mind as her captor opened its jaws : dark blood welling from the cut left by her rock , the greens-and-spice scent of its breath , the high , singing note that cut through the harsh jangle in her mind . Then she heard a sound such as she had never before heard in her life , a rumbling , ear-bursting shriek that made her think of rocky avalanches . Her captor released her ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away without understanding any of what was taking place . The jangling sound of the fierce immortal was gone , leaving only high singing in her mind . Gasping , she turned to find the enemy . It had n't moved from where it had dropped her , and it was no longer green . It had turned gray and dull , looking for all the world like a statue . It was not breathing . " Horse Lords , " she whispered in awe . Seeing movement in the corner of her eye , she spun . A new immortal walked by , intent on the statue . Taking him in , the girl decided she must be dreaming . She had seen many strange creatures since coming to Tortall  --  ogres , trolls , winged horses , unicorns , griffins , and more -- but the green thing and this one were entirely outside her experience . Like her attacker , this immortal was similar to a lizard . Walking on its hind legs , it held its long tail off the ground , reminding her of ladies raising their little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daine 's sixty-five inches , taller even than Numair 's six and a half feet . Slender and graceful , it had long , delicate paws , fragile-looking bones , and silver talons . Its beaded hide was the pearly dark gray of a thunderhead , with paler gray belly scales . Stopping at the newly made statue , the stranger broke off a finger , sniffed it , then nibbled . The finger crunched like gravel in its jaws . ? Too raw. ? The voice sounded like a whisper of  | Daine was about to protest the new hint of theft when she remembered the pack 's way to put a stop to lumbering . She took a deep breath and said , " You saved our lives . Thank you . " ? I did not act for you , but for my young cousin . ? The creature reached down to tickle Kitten 's nose . She rubbed it against his paw . " You 're family ? " Daine asked , alarmed . The thought of losing Kitten was scarier than the Coldfang . This time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only in a remote dense are basilisks and dragons kindred , yet both acknowledge a bond . ? She gulped . While Coldfangs were new , she had heard of basilisks , immortals who turned their enemies to stone . A whine made Daine look for her charges . The pups were huddled together nearby , anxiously watching the basilisk . " Are you going to attack us ? " Kitten shook her head vigorously . A wrinkle in the basilisk 's face might have been a frown . ? I am a traveler and an observer , not a killer . ? Daine looked at the Coldfang statue : it seemed dead enough to her . Still , she knew she could trust Kitten 's judgment . She went to check the pups . Silly was worst hurt , his head cut to the bone and one eye out of focus . Runt limped on a sprained paw , and several back molars were loose . Leaper , Berry , and Chaser had only bruises to show for their tussle with the Coldfang . Daine knelt in front of Silly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , calling up her magic . " He almost knocked you sillier , if that 's possible . " The young wolf whined and licked her face . " Enough , " she told him as she cupped his head in her hands . " We 'll have you fixed in no time . " This was quicker work than the squirrel had been . Infection barely had touched the open wound . She seared it in an eyeblink , and brushed through his brain to heal the inner bruises that had put his eye out of focus . The knitting of cut muscle and skin took less than a deep breath , and she was done . She touched the new scar . " I 'll let you keep this , " she teased . " The young lady wolves will think you 're dashing . C'mere , Runt. "  | The sprained paw was easy , the loose molars less so . She had never rerooted teeth before , so she worked slowly and carefully to avoid mistakes . ? Is this a new thing , this relationship of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done . ? I would not have expected men dealings with the People to improve . ? Daine smiled . In many ways he sounded like Numair . " No , sir . I 've just had a fair knack with animals since I was a pup myself ' , and then it turned to magic . Well , my teacher says it was magic all along , but I only learned to use it just a little while ago . " ? I have heard of wild magic . ? The basilisk looked down at Leaper , who had crept around until she was a few yards downwind . Her nose was up , nostrils flaring as she breathed in the immortal 's scent . Her tail waved . ? Except . for bird folk , most of the People fear ine . Your wolf friend s are unusual . ? Daine smiled wryly . " You should meet their folks . " ? I would like to do so , if you will permit it , ? was his reply . ? I would enjoy meeting the parents of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ? " They wo n't , " the girl assured him . " They 're fair unusual themselves . " ? Have you a name , wolf-girl ? " Daine . My full one 's Veralidaine Sarrasri , but that 's too much of a mouthful for everyday use . " The basilisk looked at her , large eyes cool and unblinking . Not for the first time and not , she was sure , for the last , Daine wished she could read an immortal 's thoughts as she could an animal 's . ? My full name you could not pronounce , either . You may call me Tkaa . ? Silly raced off , followed by three of the other wolves , as Leaper continued to watch the basilisk . Her litter mates soon returned . Silly , ears and tail proudly erect , bore the Coldfang 's rattle , broken off when the monster sent him flying . He dropped it in front of Daine and barked . " For me ? " she asked , picking up the rattle . " You should n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was silvery and cold , shaped in knobs like the rattle of a mortal snake . She gave it a  | shake and jumped when the thing buzzed . " Tkaa , you say these things hunt thieves ? How much of a trail do they need ? " ? None . They know where a thief had padded , and follow that awarenedd . ? Daine shuddered . " We 'd best return to camp , then . I must warn the pack . " The wolves raced through the trees and over the meadow , playfully nipping each other 's hindquarters . Kitten followed at a swift , ground-eating gallop on all fours , while Daine and Tkaa brought up the rear .  | In the clearing by the pond , the girl introduced Tkaa to Cloud . As the pups took a nap , she groomed the mare and packed . Tkaa occupied himself with Kitten , speaking in the chattering tongue she used to address him , and listening gravely to her replies . The girl fought to understand what was said , with no success . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ? You are frowning .  --  " I just do n't see how Kit can have a language , and actually talk in it , but I ca n't understand . I almost never have trouble talking to immortals . " ? Your magic permits you to speak mind to mind . Skysong is not old enough for that . On the other hand , the spoken dragon language is one they are born knowing . My people are renowned for knowledge of all languages , mortal and immortal . Before humans forced us into the Divine Realms , we walked everywhere and spoke to all . ? He looked around . ? Now I wander the mortal realm again , the first basilisk to do so in four centuries , thanks to that yellow mage.  --  " What yellow mage ? " ? The one who brought me here . He did not mean to bring me , of  | course . I sneaked through in the wake of the Stormwings he had summoned . ? Daine stared at him . " Where was this ? " ? Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the aura of his power there , brighter than that of the other mages who live inside those walls . ? More than ever , Daine wished Numair had not left so abruptly . Goddess , let him return soon , she thought . He needs to hear what Tkaa can tell us . She also wanted Brokefang to come , so they could leave the area of the pond . The thought of another Coldfang making its slow , relentless way up from the lumber camp made her skin prickle and her stomach knot . ? Calm yourself , ? advised Tkaa when she cut her palm slicing cheese for lunch . ? I doubt that the mortals who sent the Coldfang to hunt even know that that one is dead . ? " But the men who sent him have scrying crystals , " she protested . " They 'll look for him in those ? " ? They may try . ? The thought was reassuringly firm . ? Did I not say Coldfangs are thief catchers ? Too many thieves rely on magic . A Coldfang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be stopped by it . They may be slain by human weapons , but  --  as you know  --  that can be difficult . ? She made a note of that as , in the distance , she felt the pack 's approach . " The wolves are here . They may be upset when they see you . Be patient , please . " Kitten added a chirp , and the basilisk tickled her behind the ears . ? I ant always patient , ? he said . The wolves trotted out of the rocks and stopped , looking from Daine to Tkaa . Ears went flat ; hackles came up . " No ! " she cried . " He saved the pups ! There was a monster coming , and he saved all our lives ! " Quickly she explained the morning 's events . Tkaa held still as Brokefang gave him a cautious sniff . The Long Lake Pack thanks you , the chief wolf said at last . We thank you for the lives of our young , and the lives of our friends Daine and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds as if it is time for the pack to move . " Please , " she said , thinking of immortals who could trace thieves . " I would feel so much better if we did . " ? I told you they would not soon place another Coldfang on your trail , ? Tkaa reminded her .  | " No , but them that sent it might come looking for the beast-ie , " replied Daine , forgetting months of grammar lessons . " If they find that statue , they might be smart enough to keep looking uphill . " I know a place we may live in for a time , Brokefang announced . There are caves by the western pass where we can den . You will like it . There are plenty of bats for you to talk with . We will go now , if you are ready . The big wolf hesitated , then added , looking at Tkaa , You are welcome to come there , too . ? I look forward to seeing your caved . ? Then let us go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave here . Wait , Brokefang commanded . The tools . The saws and the axes . If we leave them here , and men come , they will find them and go back to cutting trees . ? You are the thieved ? ? There was surprise in Tkaa 's cool voice . ? You stole men 's tools ? They were scaring the game , Brokefang replied calmly . We made them stop . Tkaa looked at Daine . His tone was coldly stern when he said , ? This wad a bad thing you told them to do . Men will hunt them and kill them for this . ? Stung by the unfairness of it , she cried , " It was n't my fault ! " It was Brokefang 's plan , Fleetfoot explained . Short Snout yipped in approval . Battle said , Brokefang makes good plans . ? Show me , ? ordered the immortal . Russet led him into the reeds . Daine shook her head and loaded her things onto Cloud . She had finished when she heard that noise again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It lasted for only a breath . When it stopped , Tkaa emerged from the reeds . Russet danced around the basilisk , leaping like a pup with joy . He did a good thing , the wolf said . He made the tools into rock . Now no one can lift them or use them to cut trees ! Kitten whistled in glee ; Brokefang grinned broadly . The younger adults  --  Battle , Sharp Nose , Fleetfoot , and Short Snout  --  yipped happily , tails wagging . Longwind grumbled under his breath , not liking this newest change in his world .  | Frostfur sneezed in irritation . If everyone is happy , may we please leave ' ? she demanded . I would like to be far from here before men come ! Brokefang led the way through the rocks . The pack followed in single file , as Tkaa , Daine , and Cloud brought up the rear . Kitten viewed the line of march from her seat atop Cloud 's saddle , talking nonstop to Tkaa . They had gone nearly half a mile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried silently to the pack as Cloud bolted for the nearby trees . Hide ! Longwind looked back at Daine . Wolves have nothing to fear from harriers , he said in his dignified way . They have no interest in the People . Daine , joining Cloud and Kitten under branches that hid them from fliers overhead , yanked out her crossbow , and fitted a bolt into the notch . She thrust extra arrows point-first into the ground by her knee , ready to be fired . The wolves continued their leisurely trot down the trail . Tkaa dropped back so the Stormwings would n't think he was with them , but he too stayed in the open . When the four winged immortals saw him , they circled overhead . " Basilisk ! We seek two-leggers , " called a filthy-haired brunette . What looked like old blood was streaked across her bare breasts . " A man , tall for a human , with lots of magic , and a young female with dark hair . Seen ' em ? " Tkaa walked on , pretending not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the almond-shaped black eyes , black hair , and golden brown skin of a K'miri tribesman , dropped until he could hover a few feet away from Tkaa . His back was to Daine as the girl raised her bow . If he saw her , she would kill him before he could take word of her to Tristan . Cloud gently clamped her teeth on the elbow supporting the bow stock . Do n't , the mare warned . He has n't done anything to you . Yet , Daine replied silently . They 're evil , Cloud . You know they 're evil . There 's no such thing as a being who 's pure evil , retorted the mare . Just as no creature is all good . They live according to their natures , just like you .  | And their natures are evil , insisted the girl . No . Their natures are opposed to yours , that 's all . A wolf 's nature is opposed to mine , but that does not make wolves evil . Until these creatures do you harm , leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? learn tolerance ! Unaware of his danger , the K'miri Stormwing spoke to Tkaa . " You want to watch that girl , gravel-guts . She kills immortals . She liked it . She stole an infant dragon , you know , and sent the dragon mother to her death . " Daine went cold with rage , hearing this version of Kitten 's adoption . " You see her , make her stone before she puts an arrow in one of those sheep 's eyes of yours . " ? Flapper ,  --  replied Tkaa with gentle patience , ? your cawing begins to vex me . I am interested in neither your affairs nor those of mortals . ? " Remember what I said . " With a surge of his wings , the Stormwing rejoined his fellows . They circled one last time , jeering , then flew off . Only when they were gone did Cloud release Daine . Trembling in anger , the girl collected her arrows and put all but the one already loaded back in the quiver . The bow remained in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the walk to the western pass , Daine and Cloud were forced to take cover to avoid Stormwing searchers . Watching them , the girl realized there was something funny about the sky . She kept glimpsing odd sparkles of colored light winking against the clouds . At least it was n't in her own mind : Tkaa admitted to seeing it when she asked him , and the wolves , though they were unable to see color , said they noticed lightsparks overhead . They were about to cross the stream that flowed down from the gap in the mountains when Brokefang halted , nostrils flaring . The wind had brought some odd scent to his nose . Abruptly he turned right , heading along the stream bank , following the path Numair had taken the day before out of the valley . " Now what ? " Daine asked tiredly as the pack followed him . " There are n't any caves that way ! " she called . She could hear the distant bat colony in her mind . To reach them her group would have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken to show her and Numair the view of the Long Lake . The wolves disappeared from view . " Maybe they smell game or something , " she grumbled , sitting on a boulder to rest her tired feet . A scream  --  a human scream , high and terrified -- split the air . Seizing bow and quiver , Daine went after the wolves at a dead run . A horse galloped by , white showing around his eyes as he raced toward the distant lake . Daine was reaching with her magic to stop him when she heard another scream . She let the horse go , and ran in the direction from which he had come . The horse would be all right . She could tell he would n't stop until he reached his stable . Rounding a bend in the rocky pass , she found the wolves in a clearing . They were in a circle , attention fixed on the small human at the center . " It 's all right , " Daine called . " They wo n't hurt you ! " The human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face so white its freckles stood out like ink marks . The mouth dropped open in shock . Daine ? " It was Maura of Dunlath . " Horse Lords , " Daine said prayerfully . She did n't think those K'miri gods could help at a time like this , but all the same , it could n't hurt to ask . Maura gulped . " If they 're going to eat me , can they get it over with ? " Daine sighed . She could feel a headache coming on . How was she to keep out of sight , as Numair had commanded , when trouble dropped into her lap ? " They wo n't eat you , Maura . That 's just stories . Wolves never eat humans . " They taste bad , Short Snout added . You know by the way they smell . " Everyone says wolves eat people ! " The girl wiped her eyes on her sleeve . Daine walked through the circle of wolves , pausing to scratch Battle 's ears and Fleetfoot 's ruff as she passed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruel , and no wolf kills unless he 's hungry . " She put a hand on the ten-year-old 's shoulder . " Do I look eaten to you ? "  | Maura stared up at her . " Well  --  no . " " These wolves are friends of mine , just like the castle mice . " Maura looked at the pack ; they looked up at her . " They 're a lot bigger than mice , " she said fretfully . Who is she ? asked Brokefang . Why is she here ? " Good question , " replied Daine . " Maura , what are you doing here ? " The girl 's face went from scared to scared and mulish . " It 's personal . " Daine looked around . The ground nearby was trampled , as if Maura had let her horse graze for a while before it smelled wolves and fled . Saddlebags and a bedroll lay under a nearby tree . The bags showed every sign of hasty packing : they bulged with lumps , and a doll 's arm stuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleaded to be set free . Maura 's eyes were red and puffy . Her clothes -- a plain white blouse , faded blue skirt , and collection of petticoats  --  looked as if they had been put on in the dark . " You ran away . " Maura clenched her fists . " I 'm not going back . You ca n't make me . " A starling flew by on her way through the pass . She called to Daine , who smiled and waved back . Returning her attention to Maura , she asked sternly , " Just how did you think you were going to live , miss ? Where would you go ? " " My aunt , Lady Anys of the Minch , said I can visit any time . " Obviously making it up , the girl went on , " I even got a letter from her a week ago ? " " Lady Maura , " Daine began , " I may be human , but I am not stupid . That is the most ? " Agony flared nearby ; a life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she went to investigate . Fifty yards away , the bird 's crumpled form lay in the road . She picked the body up , smoothing feathers with a hand that shook . The head hung at a loose angle . When she had first visited Numair 's tower , she had seen that birds could n't tell that the windows on top of the building were made of clear glass . Many killed themselves flying into the panes before Daine warned them of the danger . The starling looked as if she had met the same end , but there was no glass here .  | Instead Daine saw something else . The sparkles she had glimpsed against the sky were thick ahead of her . Near the ground , they formed a visible wall of yellow air flecked with pink , brown , orange , and red fire . Gently she put the dead bird on a rock , trying not to cry . Starlings died all the time , but this one need not have died here and now . Be careful , Brokefang warned as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The yellowish air was stone hard . It also stung a bit , like the shocks she got from the rugs in Numair 's room on dry winter days . When she pulled her hand back , her palm went numb . She looked north . The colored air stretched as far as she could see , forming an unnaturally straight line along the spine of the mountains . Toward the south , her view was the same . Behind her , Maura screamed . Daine turned to see what was wrong . The rest of her company had arrived , Tkaa bearing a sleepy Kitten in his arms , Cloud walking behind the basilisk . " Stop it , " Daine ordered Maura crossly . " Those are my friends . If you do n't quit yelling when you get upset , you 'll bring Stormwings down on us . " " I do n't see giant lizards every day , " complained Maura . ? I am no lizard. ? Tkaa 's voice was frosty . " He 's no lizard , " Daine said , looking at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name 's Tkaa . " With her back to the girl , she did n't see Maura gather her nerve and curtsy , wobbling , to Tkaa . Brokefang did , and approved . The little one has courage , he said , showing Daine an image of what Maura had done . You could be nicer to her . She to your own kind , after all . Daine bent , picked up a rock , and hurled it at the barrier . She had to duck to save herself from a braining when the rock bounced back . Picking up her bow , she checked that an arrow was secured in the notch . " Everyone get back , " she warned . She sighted and loosed . The arrow shattered . " It 's no good . " The gloomy voice was Maura 's . " You ca n't get through it . Nothing can . I would 've ridden right into it , but my horse saw it and balked. "  | " But where did it come from ? When did it come ? Was it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did it appear after ? " ? It was done last night , ? Tkaa said . ? You must have felt something going on . The little one aid ; she told me so . ? Kitten chirped her agreement . Brokefang trotted up to sniff the barrier . He jerked back with a snarl when the air stung his nose . " Shh , " Daine whispered , kneeling to wrap an arm around his shoulders . She looked up at the basilisk . " Tkaa ? Can you pass it ? " ? Yes , ? he replied . He thrust a paw through the barrier . It moved slowly , as if in syrup , but it went . ? It is only human magic . ? He withdrew the paw . " Could you carry me through ? " The immortal shook his head . ? I would not advise you even to try . ? Daine stared at the barrier . Would Numair be able to cross it on his return ? He was a powerful mage , but even his Gift had limits . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and took off in flight . No ! " Daine cried with both her voice and magic . Stunned without striking the barrier , the little bird dropped . She picked him up . She touched him with a bit of her fire , to bring him around and to erase that ache that would result from her overreaction . " I 'm sorry , " she explained as he roused . " But keep away from the colored stuff , all right ? " Puzzled but obedient , the sparrow cheeped agreement and flew away . The girl turned to her oddly assorted audience . " First things first . I have to warn the birds about this , before any more are killed . Then we 'd best get under cover . Maura , we can talk then . Cloud , will you carry Her Ladyship 's packs ? " The mare nodded . " Load her , " Daine told the younger girl . " This wo n't take but a moment . " Sitting , she closed her eyes . Her studies had included shields to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let her shields fall . The common talk of every vertebrate creature within range poured into her mind , then quieted when she asked for their attention . Daine showed 80 them the barrier 's image , the many-colored lights within it , and its terrible solidity . To that she added the image of the dead starling . The People acknowledged her warning : they would know the barrier when they saw it and would avoid it . They would pass her warning on to those outside her ten-mile range , and keep sending it along , until all Dunlath knew the danger . Finished , Daine rose . " Let 's find those caves . " The wolves led the way from the pass until they descended into a fold of rock . It was an entrance to a small cave , which in turn opened up onto a much larger one . A pond inside provided water , though it was bone-chillingly cold and tasted strongly of stone . Passages in the rear led to other caves : escape routes , if the pack ever needed them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burdens and groomed her . Maura built a fire pit around a dip in the stone floor . The pack adults explored or napped ; the pups were nowhere to be seen . Tkaa wandered about with Kitten in tow , gouging chunks from different stones with his talons . He tasted each sample carefully , discarding most and stowing the rest near Daine 's packs . " What are they for ? " she asked .  - -  Supper , ? replied the basilisk . " Weapons ? " suggested Maura , who could n't hear Tkaa speak . " He eats them , he says , " replied Daine , thinking , This could be complicated , if I 'm forever translating when I should listen to animals . She conveniently forgot that she often did such translations for the king 's staff and the Riders . A full day and a restless night had combined to make her grumpy . Maura yelped . Daine spun to glare at her , and the younger girl clapped her hands over her mouth , looking guilty . The cause of her yelp had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pit , each carrying a good-sized piece of dead wood . They dropped their finds and went racing outside for more . " I do n't need help , " Maura called after them , voice shaking . Avoiding Daine 's eyes , she knelt to arrange tinder and kindling in the pit . " I guess they 're chewing on logs because they ca n't  | eat me . " She frowned : a fuchsia-colored puff of sparks flew up from the tinder . Within seconds a small fire burned in the kindling , and she was feeding it larger pieces of wood . " I did n't know you had the Gift , " commented Daine , getting supplies and pans from her gear . " Not much of a one , " replied the ten-year-old . She built up the fire as the pups returned with more wood . This time she actually took a branch from Leaper , though her hand trembled as she did so . " I can light fires and candles and torches . Yolane hates it when I do that . We get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same as the king , but she does n't have any . It 's no good telling her lots of people from Gifted families do n't have the Gift themselves . She thinks she 'd look like a queen if she could light the candles with magic . " Daine found a cloth ball and smiled . It was a basic soup mixture of dried barley , noodles , mushrooms , and herbs . With the addition of water and salt pork , it would make a good meal for two humans . Taking a pot to the spring , she filled it and brought it to the fire to heat . As she cut open the ball and poured its contents into the water , she said , " It seems daft , your sister worrying about what a queen looks like . Tortall has a queen , after all , a young , strong , healthy one . Unless Thayet catches an arrow or a dagger somewhere , she 's going to be queen a long time . " Maura looked away . " It 's just one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't make sense . Do n't mind me . I talk too much ; Yolane says so all the time . Tell me how you got your dragon . Did you catch her in a net , or with magic , or how ? " Daine was so upset at the suggestion of trickery that she launched into the tale of Kitten 's mother dying to defend the queen at Pirate 's Swoop . It was n't until she was dishing up the soup that she realized Maura had changed the subject , and quite effectively , too . Tkaa read this in her thoughts .  - -  She is no fool , the little one . There is something quite serious on her mind .  - -  She 's only ten , Daine pointed out silently . How serious can it be ?  |  - -  And bow old are you , Grandrnotber ? She blushed and replied , Fourteen . ? Ab . A vast difference of years and experience . Certainly no one could believe her affair , ' are as vital as your s . ? " How 's the soup ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make her feel even younger and sillier than she did just then . " Ungerfoll . " Maura swallowed her mouthful of noodles , coughed and said , " It 's really good . And clever , how you had most of it in that cloth ball . " " The Riders use them for trail rations , " Daine said , hearing voices in search of her . She put her bowl aside and got up , facing the rear entrances to the cave . The wolves gathered near her , ears pointed in the same direction . The bats streamed in from the lower caves to whirl around Daine in a dance of welcome . She laughed as the leaders came to rest on her clothes and hair , landing with the precision they used to find roosting spots among hundreds of comrades . These were little brown bats , an inch and a half to two inches from crown to paw , with a wingspan of three to four inches . Clinging to her , they looked like brown cotton bolls . Though the whole colony , nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most hung overhead rather than chance a welcome from Daine 's other companions . They greeted her in high , chittering voices , introducing themselves as the Song Hollow Colony of bats . She asked if they minded that she and her friends were in their home . They did n't mind at all , they replied . All they asked was that her friends not try to make a meal of them . " I think I can promise that , " she assured them with a smile . But what if they taste good ? asked Short Snout wistfully . It 's true , one would n't be more than a mouthful , but there are plenty of ' them here ? " He 's joking , " Daine said when the bats screeched in alarm , their voices sending jolts of pain through her teeth . Not about food , retorted Short Snout . Meals are n't funny . Daine pointed to the entrance . " Out , " she commanded . I probably would n't eat many , he said as he obeyed . It would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | Brokefang stretched . We go to hunt , he told Daine . Tonight , the pups come , too . It is time , he added as the young wolves , deliriously happy , frolicked around him . Whatever we see , we will tell you . " Good hunting , " Daine called .  --  Good hunting , ? added Tkaa . Startled by the basilisk 's remark , Brokefang asked , Do you wish to come ? ? I thank you , but no , ? Tkaa replied . Daine heard pleasure at the offer in his voice . ? I will remain with Skysong and the small two-legger . ? If Tkaa was willing to keep an eye on Maura , that left her free to try something . " Would you do me a favor ? " Daine asked the bats . " You prob'ly know , from my sending before , that the pass is cut off by some kind of barrier . " We had heard , one of the leaders replied . " As you hunt , would you explore the barrier and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it . You wo n't hit it , and if you all go , you can map the whole thing before dawn . And may I ride along with one of you ? " After a short conference , the bats agreed . One of the leaders clambered from her perch on Daine 's boot top to her collar . I am Wisewing , she said , tiny black eyes sparkling . You may try this magic with me . " Give me a moment , " she said , tickling the bat 's chin with a fingertip . " I have to sit . " The other bats clinging to her took flight . Daine went to Maura , who was covering her head with her hands . " I need to go with them , " she told the younger girl . " Why are you doing that ? " " They 'll get in my hair . " Daine planted her fists on her hips . " Odd 's bobs , " she said crossly . The brown eyes that looked pleadingly at her filled . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But Maura  --  they got in my hair because I invited them . Bats do n't fly into hair . They never bump into anything they do n't want to . " " But everybody says " Everybody 's wrong . See , they squeak at things , and listen to the squeak . " She pointed to Wisewing 's ears . The long , sensitive flaps wriggled to and fro , hearing every bit of sound in the air .  | " If the noise comes funny into their ears , they know something 's there , and they fly around it . They do n't smash into glass , or even that barrier , like birds do . Nothing 's invisible to bats . " Maura 's hands left her hair . " How can you go with them ? You ca n't fly . Can you ? " Daine shook her head . " Just with my magic , inside this lady . " She patted Wisewing . Going to where her packs rested against the wall , she sat , using them as a cushion for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she cautioned Maura . " And you 'd best go to bed soon . I have a feeling tomorrow 's going to be a long day . " Closing her eyes , she fitted herself into Wisewing instantly . Sounds poured into her ears , echoes from the cavern walls , each scratch of Tkaa 's or Kitten 's talons , Cloud 's munching , wind blowing through the caves . Wisewing leaped into the air , reaching forward with her leathery wings and scooping air back with easy grace . They were in flight . The voices of the Song Hollow bats rippled ahead of them , a river of sound that Wisewing followed eagerly . Cooler air brushed her face , and they were in the open . Daine could hear the rest of the colony flying along the barrier , heading north , south , and east in waves . Wisewing flew straight ahead , soaring until she skimmed the underside of the barrier 's highest arch . Please stop trying to see it , she protested . You 're making my eyes hurt . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can hear it everywhere . She was right . The barrier was a constant soft crackle of sound , reflecting the voices of the bats . Wisewing herself struck it constantly with her voice , and the returning echoes not only told her how far off it was , but that its underside was unnaturally smooth , like the inside of a bowl . Daine just had time to register a different , softer echo when Wisewing scooped the moth that had caused it into her waiting jaws . The taste reminded Daine of roasted , honey-glazed duck . The bat 's next victim was a tangy mosquito , followed by a moth that tasted more like fish . She 'd always known that bats ate insects by the pound on their hunts , but it was one thing to know this in her mind , another to taste flavor after flavor on her tongue .  | I do n't want to slow you down by eating , but the Big Cold is soon , said Wisewing . I must be as fat as possible by then , or I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You do n't have to apologize . On they flew , the barrier solidly above them . From all around , other bats sang out information , comparing notes about the magic , the insect supply , and the weather . The crispness of the air made Daine feel giddy and silly . Then she heard something unpleasant in the distance . The bat 's voices came to their ears from something big , something with leathery wings and claws . Her bat darted at the giant , squeaking at it from all angles , building a picture of the great creature in her mind . She had filled in little more than the huge wings and four sets of talons when Daine guessed what it was . Hurrok , she said nervously . We do n't need to hear more . Please let 's go ! ? Little squeaker , get away from me.  --  The immortal 's voice was much deeper than the chorus of bat voices surrounding him . ? I do n't like squeakers . ? Wisewing dove in , settling between the hurrok 's wings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ears , she picked up the sound of metal . It hummed with a sound the bat recognized as that of human magic . Interested in this new object , Wisewing fluttered across the immortal 's chest , to find that a metal band or collar went all the way around the hurrok 's throat . I would have to pick a nosy bat , Daine thought , sick with nerves . ? It a a slave collar , squeaker , ? the hurrok said . ? It means I must obey a human , a mortal wizard whose power makes it burn into my flesh with only a word . And do you know what that pain , and that knowing , and this collar ; do to me ? They make me feel like tearing up every living creature I see . ? She heard a roar of air as something large snapped right over her head : the hurrok had tried to catch them in its teeth . Please Goddess , prayed Daine , let me get through this without losing my life and I will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hurrok go its way . Do n't let it scare you , she told Daine . It 's much too big  | and slow to catch us . An awl , now  --  an owl is dangerous . You want to stay away from them , particularly barn owls . I shall keep that in mind , Daine replied . See that you do , the bat said firmly , and scooped up a fly . She did n't know how long she flew with the bats , but it must have been for hours . When she opened her own , human eyes and lurched to the cave 's entrance , false dawn had turned the eastern horizon pearly gray . She still heard the Song Hollow bats as they returned to their home , greeting her as they flew by . Her mind full of Wisewing 's memories , she identified each by his or her particular squeak : Singwing , Chitter , Eatsmoths , Whistle , Flutter . Reunited in the cave where they roosted , they sang their news . From their combined voices Daine built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dawn her worst fears were confirmed . The wizards ' barrier sealed off the entire valley , with no crack or cranny left for a determined girl to wriggle through . Mission done and bellies full , the bats went to sleep . Daine stayed at the entrance , listening to the shift of hooves on stone as Cloud changed position in her sleep , a soft munch that was Tkaa as he nibbled on a piece of rock , the bustle of voles in the grass . Her ears were tired and sore , the muscles around them cramped from use . Reaching up to rub them , Daine touched a long flap of leathery skin that flicked to and fro , catching each quiver of sound in the air . Her hand shook . Slowly , praying to the Goddess , the Horse Lords , Mithros , and any other god who might be listening , she felt the other ear . It too was long , and twitching independently of its mate , gathering every sound from that side of her head . She knew without looking that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half inches behind her , that Kitten lapped water from the spring , and that a raccoon on the mountainside twelve feet and eight inches above her head was finishing a late-night supper of something crunchy , probably acorns . What is this ? she thought , her skin prickling . Why is my body changing ? It 's staying right where I left it . I do n't change when I do this , I just send my mind someplace else . So how could I have bats ' ears ?  | Unless I 'm just imagining that part of me changes . If I am , it means I 'm going mad after all , she thought , strangely calm . Surely someone would have told me that it 's possible to change part of yourself into something else . If I ignore these ears , they 'll go away , or my mind will let go of them , or whatever . Maybe if I sleep , I 'll wake up and be normal again . That seemed like a good idea . Returning to the large cave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the ears will be gone , and I wo n't be crazy , she told herself firmly as she slid into her blankets . She pulled the covers over her head , just in case . If the ears were still there , she did n't want Maura to wake her with a scream .  | She awoke slowly , leaving dreams in which she clung to the cavern with the other Song Hollow bats , becoming her normal self in the cave that she shared with her motley group of friends . For a moment she thought she was deaf , the sounds she heard were so few and so dim . She clapped a hand to one ear and found a small , curved shell where the long , ribbed flap had been . Feeling relief mixed with sadness , she knew she was not deaf . Her ears were human once more . " You 're up , " said Maura . " I wanted to wake you for break-fast  --  I was afraid you 'd sleep all day  --  but Tkaa said leave you be . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it on the ground as Daine sat up . " I hope you do n't mind me'n Kitten getting in your things . I did n't bring any food , and we were etarninq . I found your tea , and the wolves found a beehive , so me'n Kitten had honey for our porridge , and I made tea with honey for you . " " Thanks . " Half-awake , Daine asked the first question that came to mind , the one she ought to have asked more firmly the day before . " Why 'd you run off ? " The younger girl looked down . " I ca n't say . "  | Daine sniffed her tea : it smelled wonderful . " You must . If you had a spat with Yolane , or if you think it 's fun to live out in the woods like me , that 's no good . You 'll have to go home . " " What if she wants to send me to school to be a lady , and I want to go to court and be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl reddened . " You 've heard too many tales about the King 's Champion . I 'm not here for fun , Maura , and it 's wrong to run off for fun . Leaving home 's serious . " Remembering the wreck of her own home , she added , " You 're lucky to have a place that 's yours . You do n't just throw that away . " She grinned . " And I doubt you 'd have any luck as a knight . You screech whenever you see something odd . " Maura smiled , then looked at her hands . " I have to see the king . I ca n't say why . I know girls my age are n't supposed to know important stuff , but I do , and he has to know . " " If it 's that Tristan is making trouble for Tortall , you 're behind the fair , " Daine replied . " We know he 's in the Carthaki emperor 's service . Numair went out of the valley so he could report to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he 'll be back . " Maura looked at Daine with a frown . " Is that all you know ? About Tristan ? " " I know for a fact he brought Tkaa here . " " For which I am grateful , " a whispery voice said from the entrance . Daine squeaked and lunged for her crossbow . Maura rescued the endangered mug of tea . When Daine brought the cocked and loaded bow to bear on the entrance , she saw only Tkaa and Kitten . " Who said that ? " she demanded . The basilisk stared at her . " I told you my people speak all tongues . " The whispery voice did come from his mouth . " The only reason I did not address Lady Maura in this wise from the first was that my skills were rusty . In the Divine Realms and with you it is easier to speak mind-to-mind . " " Mithros , Minoss , and Shakith , " Daine breathed . " I do n't know what to say . " " Then say nothing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is best . "  | Still unnerved by hearing him speak human , Daine got clothing out of her packs and took it into her bedroll to dress . As she did , wriggling under the covers , she heard Maura tell the basilisk , " We need to think about laundry and supplies . I ca n't eat all Daine 's food . " If Tkaa answered , his voice was drowned out by a sound . Once Daine had heard a great bell , its sides as thick as her hand , clang as it was struck with a mallet . This noise was similar , but so loud it made her teeth and ears ache . Hundreds of yards away , cushioned from the outer air by tons of rock , the Song Hollow bats heard it and were startled into flight . Cloud neighed in protest outside ; Kitten dived into Daine 's blankets , pulling them over her tender ears . Tkaa clapped his forepaws over his earholes and shut his eyes in pain . " What was that ? " cried Maura . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eardrums . Where ? she asked the bats , knowing they could pinpoint it . Confused and frightened , they sent an image of the western pass as it would appear to them , painted in sound at night . She grabbed her crossbow and quiver . Barefoot , shirt halftucked into her breeches , she ran outside . Cloud followed at a gallop , and when she drew alongside , Daine leaped onto the pony 's back in a trick learned from the Riders . As the mare raced for the barrier , Daine counted the bolts in her quiver with her fingers : ten . She hoped that would be enough if Stormwings caught her in the open . When they reached the barrier , they saw no one . Daine could hear a marmot scolding on the other side of the magical wall . " If you see any danger , nip me or something , " she ordered her mare , and sat down . Closing her eyes , she listened for the marmot . She found her quarry instantly . The marmot , a female , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the pass , guarding the entrance to the burrow she shared with her large family . Shocked , frightened , and irate , she was calling the man below names that Daine had n't thought a marmot would use . You must have learned that from squirrels , she commented . None of the marmots I know ever said such things .  | They were n't scared out of their wits , retorted the chubby rodent . I was minding my own business , standing watch , and the two-legger made that noise . He scared me out of a month 's fat ! I 'll have to eat twice as much now to be ready for the Big Cold and ? Look at him ! He 's going to do it again ! If you do I will bite you ! she screamed at the man . I do n't care if you kill me , I will take a big chunk out of you before I 'm dead ! May I ? asked Daine , and slipped into the marmot so she could see with her hostess 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way into the pass stood two horses and a tall , lanky human . He was raising his hands again . Sweat trickled down his face as black fire gathered around his palms . He shouted something and hurled the fire at the barricade . The noise was so loud that Daine was jolted back into her own body . " Tkaa ! " she called . ? I am here . ? The basilisk had caught up with her while Daine was speaking with the marmot . He looked a bit odd : someone , probably Maura , had wrapped cloth around his head to protect his earholes . " It 's Numair -- my teacher . " ? A mortal is doing that ?  --  " Would you cross and tell him to stop ? Oh , wait  --  perhaps he 's doing it to break down the barrier . If he is , would you ask him how long it will take , so I can warn my friends ? I suppose he 'll want to know about the Coldfang , and you should tell him Maura 's with us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sounding faintly amused . ? You may think of other things for me to tell him while I am gone . ? He walked over to the barrier and was halfway through when Daine remembered something else . " Tkaa , wait ! " He looked at her . ? Quickly , if you please . This is not comfortable . ? " If you can go through , Stormwings can go through . Warn him , please . They might be on their way now , if Tristan heard all this racket . " The basilisk walked through the barrier . Daine looked at 92 Cloud . " I need my writing kit . Tkaa does n't know all I 've learned , and Numair has to be warned . " She stopped . In her mind she heard approaching Stormwings . " We 've got trouble , " she said , and mounted the pony . " What did Tkaa call them ? Flappers ? " Just what we need , replied the mare . In the distance she heard Maura say pleadingly , " Go away ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rounded a bend . Maura stood where the trail to the caves met the pass road . Above her was a flock of ' Stormwings . " Maura , get down ! " shouted Daine . Cloud stopped as she brought the crossbow to bear on one of the monsters . No ! " Maura lunged at Daine , grabbing for the bow . Her weight dragged Daine 's arm down . For one perilous moment the crossbow was aimed point-blank at the ten-year-old 's chest . Cloud reared . Maura lost her grip on the bow , and Daine swung it away from her . She was trembling in fear and anger . " Do n't ever do that again ! " she cried . " I could have killed you ! " " I 'm sorry , " Maura said , looking down . " But I could n't let you hurt them . " Stormwings were landing on the ground in front of them . Three moved out of Daine 's sight . Turning , she saw them settle on the road behind her , cutting off any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stormwing , a male who wore a collection of bones braided into his long blond hair . He stared back at her , contempt in his eyes , then looked at the younger girl . " Tell her we mean you no harm , Lady Maura . " " You 're on speaking terms with them ? " Daine asked . Maura shrugged . " They visit Yolane and Belden a lot . He is Lord Rikash . " " And she is a Stormwing killer , " barked the snarl-haired brunette who had spoken to Tkaa the day before . " She slew one of our queens last year ! " " She tried to kill me , " Daine snapped . " It was a fair fight -- a lot fairer than she deserved . " 95 Rikash hopped around Maura and stopped near Cloud , looking her and her rider over with chilly green eyes . The mare had seen his kind before . While their scent of rotten meat and bad death hurt her nose , she had learned to stand fast when they were near . She eyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew what was in the pony 's mind : one more hop and he 'd be in range for a bite . Do n't hit the feathers , warned Daine silently . They 'll cut your mouth . Do n't teach your dam to nurse a foal , Cloud retorted . " You are quick to judge us , Stormwing killer , " Rikash snarled . " Too quick , for a human . You come from a race that spends more time murdering your own kind than do all the immortals put together , yet you insist you are better than us . " He spat on the ground , and looked at Maura . " You can not leave Dunlath , and you must not stay here . Come home . Yolane does n't need to know you were away . " " You mean she has n't noticed I 'm gone , " Maura said bitterly . " Has anyone ? " " That is unjust , " the Stormwing replied , firmly and gently . " You know very well that the cook and your nurse are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them notes . I told them not to worry . " There was something odd between these two , Daine realized . The immortal spoke to Maura with affection . That was impossible . Stormwings were cruel , heartless : she had enough experience of them to know that . Worse , Maura addressed Rikash as she might an older brother or an uncle . Watching the immortals , Daine saw that she needed help . Starlings gathered with the coming of fall , to gossip and to migrate . Nearby she found three such flocks , each with over fifty birds , and called them to the trees and rocks around her before she looked again at Maura and Rikash . " Do you know what hii sort do ? " she asked the younger girl . " They befoul the dead who fall in battle . They live on human fear and anger . They 're monsters ! " Maura shrugged thin shoulders . " They ca n't help how they 're made , Daine. "  | " Maura " ? Rikash shook his head ? " you ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't encourage her , " he told Daine . " You 're old enough to know better . " " I already know better , " retorted Maura . Daine glared at the Stormwing . " I have n't been encouraging her . I tried to make her go back . You 're the one with the wings -- you take her . " Maura sat on the ground , chin sticking out . " I wo n't go back , and you ca n't make me . They 're traitors . I wo n't stay under the same roof with them . My father would haunt me all my life if I did . " " Let us talk of this away from prying ears , " Rikash said , an eye on Daine . " We can speak of it now . Daine ca n't tell anyone . She 's stuck here , too . " " Quiet ! " ordered the Stormwing . " You 're a child . You do not understand what is taking place , and you must not speak of matters you can not comprehend . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stormwings , Daine looked down so Rikash would n't see her smile . Obviously he liked Maura , or he would have bullied rather than debated her . She also could see debate was useless . Maura had the bit between her teeth and would not obey orders . " Go on , " she urged the fuming immortal . " Shut her up . I never thought to see you stinkers balked by anyone , let alone a ten-year-old . " Rikash turned red under his dirt , and a few of his own flock cackled . " It is hard for us to bear young , " he said , a hint of gritted teeth in his voice . " That being the case , we value others ' young , particularly when they are neglected . Affection has led me to indulge Lady Maura more than is wise . " Maura sighed . " All right , Lord Rikash . I 'll hush . Only , I 'm not coming back with you . You do n't have to tell them you saw me . " Rikash shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would beat you , " he said with grim resignation . He looked up at Daine , eyes sharp . " As for you ? " Daine grinned , and made a silent request of the starlings . They set up a clamor , flapping their wings and voicing painfully shrill , loud whistles . " Go on , " she told Rikash , raising her voice  | to be heard . " Take me in . You might last two or three minutes in the air with my friends going for your eyes . " The Stormwings looked at the birds with alarm . Starlings , cowards and clowns alone or in small groups , were bullies in a flock . Their whistles alone made the immortals try unsuccessfully to cover their ears . " The gods help you if I catch you in the open , " Rikash snarled , flapping his wings . " Maura , you had better rethink your choice of friends ! " The Stormwings took to the air as the starlings jeered and insulted them . Wheeling , the immortals flew straight at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend ? " Maura cried , grabbing Daine 's arm . " It was him making the noise , was n't it ? They might hurt him ! " " I do n't think so , " said Daine , watching the barrier . There was a sound like a thunderclap . The Stormwings returned , covered with soot from claws to crown and reeking of onions . " They hate onions , " Daine told Maura as they flew by , tears running down their faces as they sneezed frantically . " We found out last fall , when we helped mop up after pirates raided Port Legann . " " Goddess bless , " the younger girl breathed , watching the retreat until the Stormwings were no longer in view . Dismounting from Cloud , Daine let the pony go ahead of them on the trail to the caverns . " I ca n't believe you like them , " she muttered . Maura glared at her . " Well , I ca n't believe you like wolves . " There was little Daine could say to that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever arguments she made . When they entered the caves , Kitten greeted her with joyful chirps and whistles . Smiling , Daine held and petted her for a little while . " Sorry , Kit , " she said at last , and put her friend down . " I have plenty to do . " Locating her writing tools , she stowed them in a pack . " You 're going back there ? " Maura asked . " I must . There 's things Numair has to know . " The younger girl took a deep breath . " Then you 'd better tell him Belden and Yolane are going to rebel against the king , and soon . "  | Daine , stunned , let her pack slip to the floor . " A rebellion ? " Maura nodded , red with shame . Kitten , chirping in concern , rubbed her head against the girl 's knee . " I did n't know anything for sure until the day after you left , " Maura explained . " It was after lunch sometime , because my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't want her to catch me . " " A backboard ? " asked Daine . " It 's so old-fashioned . Nobody uses it anymore . You 're strapped with your shoulders against it for hours  --  it 's supposed to teach girls to sit up straight . Nurse says I 'm round shouldered , and she puts me on it whenever she can . " Daine shuddered . " It sounds horrible . I 've never heard Kally  --  Princess Kalasin  --  mention such a thing . " " Good . If we get out of all this , please tell my nurse the princess does n't have one . Anyway , I left through the secret passage in the family wing . I was behind Yolane 's study when I heard Belden yell , ' What do you mean , he 's gone ? ' I heard Tristan and Yolane say be quiet , and I stopped . There 's spy holes in all the rooms , so I could see and hear everything . It was them and the others , Alamid and Gissa and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were n't going to the City of the Gods . He wrote and invited them . " Daine 's stomach growled . She dug out cheese and a sausage , cutting off portions for herself and for Maura . " So what did you hear ? " " Tristan told Belden it 's all under control . And Belden said Tristan told him Master Numair would pass out from the nightbloom in his wine and when that did n't work , Tristan said there was no way Master Numair could leave the valley . Yolane said they 're in trouble if Numair warns the king , and Tristan said he only knows Tristan and Alamid and Gissa are here . He said they 'll warn the other con  --  conspirators , and speed up the rebellion . They 'll strike with the next full moon , not at Midwinter like they planned . " Daine dug her brushes , paper , and ink out of the pack . " Wait  --  let me write this down . " Shaking the bottle of readymade ink , she unstoppered it and wet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed up note taking , she wrote the main points of what Maura had said thus far . " Go on . "  | Maura drank some water . " Belden said he did n't like how this is going , and Tristan told the mages to show Belden how they 'd ward the valley , and they left . After that Yolane said she hoped this would work . Tristan said as long as she keeps up her end , she 'll be queen by the first snows . And Yolane said how can she keep her bargain when the next shipment is sealed in with us ? Tristan said they 'll handle that when the shipment 's ready . Then he started kissing her and saying what a fine queen she 'd make , and I left . I snuck out of the castle that night ? I hoped I could get out of Dunlath before they closed it off . " " Can you remember anything else ? " Maura shook her head . " I told you everything . I kept going over it in my head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . " " What 's this shipment they talked about ? " " Whatever they mine up in the north part of the valley . They 've been sending that out of Dunlath all summer . " Daine put her things away and tucked her notes into the waistband of her breeches . " Numair has to know all this . He can warn the king . " " He can speak over distances with his Gift ? " The younger girl sighed . " I wish I could do that . It would make things a lot easier . " " Is there anyone in the valley who can ? " Maura shook her head . " Just Tristan and his friends . Some villagers have the Gift , but it 's like mine . Just good for a couple of things , and nobody can far-speak . Anyone who has a strong Gift leaves to get better training . " Daine sighed . " That 's typical . One last thing  --  did n't you sort of promise Rikash you would n't tell me any of this ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I did n't . Maybe Yolane forgot her duty to the Crown , but I have n't . " She rubbed her sleeve over her eyes . Touched , Daine gave her friend a quick hug . " All right . I have to take this to Numair . Look after Kitten while I 'm gone , wo n't you ? " Cloud also stayed behind as Daine returned to the barrier . On a slope nearby , the girl found a tumble of rock , one huge slab of which formed a lean-to against its fellows . She hid there ,  | out of the open , and began to write , using the notes she had taken from Maura . To that she added the news that the barrier enclosed the entire valley . She was finishing when she heard the high , singing note that was Tkaa 's presence in her mind . Peering out of her shelter , she saw the basilisk step through the barrier , and waved him up to her hiding place . ? He says he can not break this spell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nu wt summon more help . ? Daine rewet her brush and added a further note to her letter : " Ca n't you use one of those words of power on it ? " ? He is unusual , ? Tkaa remarked as Daine waited for her ink to dry . ? When I crossed the barrier ; he thought I meant to attack . He threw fire at me . I sang the rock spell without thinking ? I am not at my best when I am rushed . ? A note that might have been amusement entered his soft mental voice . ? He became stone , of course . The spell never fails . It lasted for a breath , and then he shattered it , as if all I had done was pour clay on him and bake it . And then he asked me to do it again , to see of he could break the spell twice . ? Daine rubbed her aching head . " He would , " she said dryly . " And did you ? " ? I suggested that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us have the leisure to enact them properly . If you encounter dragons , you will find the same excuse works with them . More than anything , dragons and mages like to take time with their studies . ? " Well , thank Mithros for that , " replied the girl . " Will you take this to him ? It 's important . " ? To become a messenger at my age , ? Tkaa remarked , shaking his head . Daine smiled up at him . " Thank you . I am grateful for your help . " There was affection in his voice when he replied . ? It is I who must thank you . In four hundred years in the Divine Realms , I have not enjoyed myself as much as I have in the last two days . Life ear more vivid here , much headier. ? The message in his hand , he returned to the glowing barrier and passed through . She waited for a moment and then decided she wanted to hear Numair 's comments as he read her note . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permission to become  | part of her . The chubby creature , named Quickmunch , agreed . Daine had the knack of it so well by now that it took only an eye-blink to enter the marmot . It took a bit longer to convince Ouickmunch to leave the safety of the burrow and her family , and to approach Numair and Tkaa so Daine could hear them . If he makes that noise again , I will bite him , Quickmunch said as she made her cautious way down the rocky slope , with frequent checks overhead for eagles . Humans never stop to think of the People when they are up to their tricks . He does n't mean to be rude , Daine said as they stepped onto the road . From here , Spots and Mangle were as big as houses . Quickmunch 's first reaction was to run . Daine persuaded her that the horses were peaceful , but Quickmunch still passed them in a wide arc . When she saw Tkaa with Numair , she barked in alarm . As the immortal bent to examine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and saw what Tkaa was doing . " Daine , is that you ? Can you understand me ? " Nod , Daine told the marmot , and Ouickmunch nodded stiffly . This means something to him ? she asked . It means yes , the girl said . It means we understand human speech . Now let me hear what he has to say . Numair held up Daine 's letter . " Your news is serious , but not surprising . Dunlath is too well guarded simply to be a country backwater . When we 're done talking , I 'll get under cover and speak to the king again . " He shook his head . " As to the barrier ? did you notice the mixture of colors ? It 's hard to break a joined spell like this , in which several mages take part . " His mouth tightened . " Also , there is an added dimension to this working . The mages Tristan has are disciplined ; Alamid and Gissa are both Masters . I believe Redfern may be , as well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some kind , from the power I just threw at the barrier . " A blush rose in his dark cheeks . " I should n't have done that , of course . I 'm afraid I lost my temper . " The fact remains , the barrier absorbed my Gift and did n't reflect it . That means it is fueled with more power than the combined Gifts of Tristan 's group can produce . They must be using gemstones that act as power sources to anchor it . If that 's  | the case , I may have to wait for mages to come from the City of the Gods and the Royal University to break it . " She pointed to the paper in his hand . " Remember what I told you of the words of power . " He rubbed his face . " For each one used properly , there is a reaction elsewhere of similar magnitude . The word that may break this spell will cause an earthquake somewhere else . I will not kill untold numbers of people to get through , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do have some good news . King Jonathan said that two Rider groups and a company of the King 's Own are nearby , on border patrol . They 're to be sent here . The Sixth Rider Group will arrive in two days , the Twelfth in four , and the men of the King 's Own in three days . The mages may take as long as a week to reach us , but that ca n't be helped . " Daine shivered . She did not like the idea of days passing before Numair got help . True , he could defend himself , but there was no telling what unpleasant surprises were tucked into Tristan 's sleeve . " You said each word of power used properly , ' " remarked Tkaa in Common . He had been listening intently . " What if a word of power is used improperly ? " Numair grimaced . " The magic backfires . It 's one reason there are so few of my rank . The others who tried to reach it are dead . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into your friends ' minds ? Is it difficult ? " The marmot nodded yes to the first question and shook her head to the second . For a moment Numair sank deep into thought , pulling his long nose idly . " Daine , I have a tremendous favor to ask , " he said finally , coming out of his brown study . " We need more precise information . Is there a way , without putting yourself in danger ; that you can enter the northern and southern forts and count the men posted there ? " Daine nodded , through Quickmunch . It was the next logical step . " You can do it from within an animal 's mind , and your human self will be at a safe distance ? " Again the marmot nodded .  | " And you 'll be able to return to your own body without mishap ? " Another nod . " The sooner you can do it , the better . And be careful , or I will not put you in the deepest , darkest dungeon I find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in northern Scanra and drop you in the deepest crevasse known to man . " Quickmunch turned her back to Numair and flipped her tail up , then faced him again . I like this way of talking , the marmot confided to Daine . The mage was grinning . " How are you fixed for supplies ? " He glanced at the horses ' packs . " I can share what I have , particularly since you are feeding Maura as well as yourself . " Quickmunch shook her head and began to climb to her burrow . He 's being silly , Daine told her . I 'm a lot better able to supply myself than he is . I know where there are good roots , if you 'd like to dig them up , the marmot offered . They 're really very nourishing . That 's sweet , Daine replied . But I can find enough food . You eat them . After all , you ca n't take chances when the Big Cold is on the way . Nou ' you sound like one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to do this again , please let me know . It was interesting . Smiling , Daine returned to herself . The opening of the stones that hid her was blocked by a large , dark shape . She nearly panicked before she saw it was Maura and Kitten , peering at her with the strangest expression on their faces . " What 's the matter ? " she asked , and frowned . Long hairs stuck out on both sides of her nose , and her front teeth felt odd . " And what are you doing here ? " " Why did you do that to your face ? " asked the ten-year-old . " You look like a mummer at Midwinter Festival . " " Do what ? " No , she was not mistaken . Something was very wrong with her front teeth . " What do you mean , a mummer ? " " You know  --  they play the parts of the animals , asking Mithros to bring back the sun , so they glue whiskers and furry noses to their faces . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone flat and  --  there was no way to get around it  --  furred , and she had long whiskers curving from either side of her mouth . Her top and bottom incisors were long and extremely sharp , sharp enough to cut her skin . " You can see all this ? " It was hard to talk around rodent teeth . Kitten trotted over and touched the new parts with gentle claws . " Of course , " Maura replied scornfully . " It 's as plain as the nose ? " She stopped just in time . The rest , " on your face , " did- n't seem tactful . Daine whooped and stood up , nearly braining herself on the rock overhead . Going outside , she grabbed Maura by the hands and danced her around , laughing . " I 'm not crazy ! " she cried . " I 'm not mad ! It 's real ! The changes are real ! " She skidded to a halt , realizing something . " I think the badger knew this would happen . He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it was human again . " Odd 's bobs . Could I make the whole change ? Change entirely into an animal ? That would be wondrous . " " Do n't ask me , " replied Maura . " Do you know how it hap-pens ? " " No , but I 'll find out . " There was a screech overhead . Daine looked up in alarm , but the caller was only a hawk . " And here we are , dancing in the open like idiots . Let 's get under cover , and decide how we 'll eat tonight . " She trotted back toward the caves , Maura and Kitten behind her . " I should have brought food and stuff , " Maura complained , panting as she ran . " I did n't stop to think about anything like that . I just wanted to get out of there and get word to the king . " " Are you sure you ca n't go home now ? " asked Daine . " You know that help is on the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glanced at her friend . Maura 's face was set . " I ca n't be attending you , you know . Numair wants me to count the soldiers in the forts  --  unless you know how many there are . " Maura shook her head . " They never talked about anything like that around me . If they had , I 'd 've gotten help a long time ago . " " But would n't you rather be sleeping on a soft bed under warm blankets ? Not to mention your servants being afeared for  | you . " They had reached the entrance cave . Once inside , they slowed to a walk . " You do n't understand , " Maura said , catching her breath . " If you 're noble and you find treason , and you live with the plotters or go to their parties or marry into their family or anything , then you are just as guilty as they are . " " You 're only ten , " Daine argued , taking all of her remaining supplies from her packs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up before the Lord Provost . " Maura sat by the fire pit . " My father said the laws were written long ago , when times were simpler . They used to hang children for stealing bread , did you know that ? Some things have changed , but not chivalry and the nobles ' duties . That 's what makes me mad . Yolane was raised the same as me . She knows what 's right and wrong , but she does n't care . By law Dunlath can be plowed up and sown with salt , and our people made to leave , but does she care ? No . She 'd rather risk lives and our home so she can wear a crown and order people around . " Daine patted her friend 's arm . " She wo n't get that chance , and nothing 's going to happen to Dunlath . You trust Master Numair . He 'll fix it . " Maura smiled crookedly . " It is n't him ? I do n't know him at all . You 're the one I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathering enough food to ensure that Maura would eat properly . Fish would do for that night , with rice from her supplies . The game birds could be baked in clay for Maura to have later . Kitten found mushrooms and blueberries , which would make pleasant additions . When they returned to the caves , Tkaa was there . " He is under cover , natural and magical , for the night , " the basilisk said as the girls began to cook . " I promised him that I would stay with Lady Maura . " The ten-year-old grinned . " I 'd like that . " Seeing the pleasure in her face , it was hard to believe that one day ago she had screamed upon seeing him . " The wolves still make me nervous . " When Daine glanced at her , she shrugged . " I 'm sorry , they just do . Speaking of them , where have they been all day ? " " Hunting , I s'pose , " Daine replied . " Some days it takes longer than others . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pack , and realized it had been the evening before . " They 'll be back when they 've fed . " She was dishing up the rice and fish when she saw Tkaa reach into a pouch in the skin of his belly . " Did I know you had that ? " she asked , curious . " One does not expect the very young to know a great deal , " he replied . He drew several chunks of rock from the pouch and placed them near the small pile of stones that was to be his own meal . " Dessert , " he explained in his soft voice , when he saw that the girls , Kitten , and Cloud watched him intently . " The birds and the rice and the rest of my supplies will hold you whilst I 'm gone , " Daine told Maura as they ate , wincing as Tkaa crunched his meal . " You 'll be fine here . Tkaa will be with you , and Kitten . " The young dragon , wrinkling her muzzle at Tkaa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Wolves ? ? " Maura started to ask , voice quivering . " I 'm sorry . I do n't mean to whine . Only , all my life I was told wolves will eat me . It 's hard to forget . " " But you think Stormwings are fine . " Daine knew she kept returning to that point , but she could n't help herself . She had battled them for so long that it was well-nigh impossible to see them as anything but foul . " Not all of them . The one that called you a Stormwing killer and some of the others can be nasty . But Lord Rikash takes me flying sometimes . " Daine gaped . " Flying ? " " Yes . They made a rope sling for me , and they carry me in their claws . It 's fun ! They 're a lot stronger than you think . " " Smell ? " Daine 's voice came out as a strangled squeak . " Oh , I dab perfume under my nose , and I breathe through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I could n't smell a thing . That was the best time . And when you 're up in the air over everything , who cares about smells ? " The rest of his meal eaten , Tkaa put a dessert rock in his mouth and hummed his satisfaction . Daine , glad to change the subject , asked , " Is it good , then ? " Tkaa nodded . " The best I 've ever had . They are well aged , and I am most partial to this dark variant . "  | Maura shook her head . " Would n't you rather have real candy ? I have spice drops . You just reminded me . " She fished a crumpled paper from a pocket and offered its contents to Daine and Kitten , who accepted with pleasure , then to Tkaa . The basilisk thanked her politely , but it was easy to see he was not tempted to trade his " candy " for hers . " What is it , the stone you 're eating ? " Daine asked . The basilisk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whistle , half croak . The rock flared with a multitude of lights colored blue , violet , and green , with tiny sparks of red and amber . Slowly the lights faded . " Black opals , " the immortal announced with pleasure . " The finest I have ever eaten . " Kitten sat up and whistle-croaked . The pile of stones shone with the same rainbow of colors , and went dark . " Very good , Skysong , " approved Tkaa . Daine frowned . Here was the answer to the mines and the emperor 's interest . " Yolane ships opals to Carthak , " she said . " And Ozorne gives her mages , gold , maybe even soldiers , for when she rebels against King Jon . " " This just gets worse and worse . " Maura 's voice was tight . " It 's illegal to mine precious metals and stones without telling the Crown . " " Prob'ly for just this reason , " Daine pointed out . " So folk wo n't sell them and use the money , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hand on Maura 's shoulder . " We 'll stop them , Lady Maura . You 'll see . "  | Tkaa promised to tell Numair of the opals in the morning , then entertained Maura and Kitten with tales of the Divine Realms . Daine put out the food and made sure Maura knew how to cook it . She was impressed by the girl 's camp-lore : few ten-year-olds could build a fire , let alone cook on it . Maura gave the huntsman Tait the credit . " You 're lucky in your friends , " Daine said as she tucked Maura in . " If not my family , " agreed Maura , yawning . " The wolves really wo n't eat me ? " Daine took a breath and counted to ten , so she would n't give an angry reply . It worked , simply because Maura was asleep by the time she finished counting . " I leave to go south at dawn , " she told Kitten , Tkaa , and Cloud later . Tkaa switched to thought-speech , confiding that so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ache . ? Have you decided how you will go in ?  | " I 'll see who 's about , " replied Daine . " Oh , listen  --  the pack 's coming . " ? We must take your word for that , remarked the basilisk , amused . ? In this , your magic is more powerful than ours . ? Kitten nodded . Daine went to the cave entrance to greet the wolves . The moment she saw them , she wished she had remained seated . Brokefang , in the lead , bore a ham in his jaws . Frostfur was next with a rope of sausages . Each wolf had something : small bags of grain , meat , sacks of potatoes . Each pup proudly , and gently , bore an egg in his or her mouth . Also , enthroned on Sharp Nose 's back , nagging the wolf to trot slower , was the squirrel she had healed two days ago . Brokefang put the ham at her feet as the rest of the pack carried their burdens into the cave . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daine , panting happily . He wants to help . " Help with what ! " Daine whisper-screamed . Tkaa , Kitten , and Cloud came out to see why she was so excited . " Are you crazy ? Why did you steal all this food ? Where did you steal it ? Mithros above , how did you steal it ? " Easily , Battle replied . We visited the tree cutter den . They had more food than they could use . We ate some ourselves , and we spoiled the rest . Frolic added , We knew you and the human pup would soon eat all you have . Besides , if the men have no food , they will not have the strength to cut trees . " I told you , the Coldfang was set on your trail because you stole the axes ! It 'll be a lot easier to track you when you stole hams and onions ! They smell ! " If they follow , we are ready , said Brokefang coolly . There is a rockfall up the slope . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can use other ways out of the cave . It will do no good to moan , What have I done ? ' as you have been . ( Only Frostfur can be that charming , thought Daine . ) It is time for us to think this way . Men bully us all our lives . It is time for some revenge . Only a little , Brokefang cautioned . Avoiding two-leggers is still best . " What of you ? " Daine asked the squirrel , knowing there  | was nothing she could say to change the wolves ' minds . " How did you get pulled into this madness ? " You told me to listen to nonwolves , Brokefang reminded her . Surely listening means speaking , too . The big fellow here told me they fight tree cutters , the little rodent said . If anyone fights them , I will help . Do you know how many of my kind lost homes and feeding grounds this year ? The Highbranch family starved , in the growing season , because their nesting places were cut down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the wolf said , looking up at the squirrel . I am Flicker , replied the squirrel . My family is Round Meadow . ? It is useless to get excited , ? Tkaa said to Daine , not unkindly . ? As you told me , you did not ask them to do this . They thought of it themselves , and perhaps it is not such a bad thing to think . ? Daine sighed . Tkaa was right . Also , there was nothing she could say to the pack that she had not said before , clearly with little effect . Instead she looked at Flicker . Squirrels had nimble forepaws , as good as hands in their way , and quick reflexes . They had keen eyes and ears , and a great deal of curiosity . Flicker was perfect for her needs . " How would you like to go for a walk in the morning ? " she asked him . Often during her ride south Daine cursed the need for secrecy that kept her , Cloud , and Flicker high on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They stopped often to rest Cloud , although the mare argued that she was not a soft valley pony , to be coddled every step of the way . By the time they reached the woods near the southern fort , the afternoon was half gone . Daine cared for Cloud before taking a seat under an old willow . Its long branches swept the earth , screening her and her friends from view . With the mare to stand guard , she was as safe here as anywhere in Dunlath . Making herself comfortable against the bole of the tree , she asked Flicker , " Ready ? "  | The squirrel finished the nut he was eating and launched himself into the willow 's branches . Ready ! he replied . Daine closed her eyes . Before she could draw an entire breath , she was in Flicker 's mind . Swiftly they climbed high on the bole , then leaped for the next tree . He seized what looked like a clump of leaves and little more , and fell . Daine opened her eyes . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped to the next branch down and scolded . How are we to do anything if you go away on the easiest jumps ? Come back at once , and do n't be such a baby . I thought you went flying with a bat just the other night . The bat was flying , not falling and missing his grip ! she retorted silently . I did not miss my grip . That was a controlled drop . Now are you coming ? Just a moment , Daine replied . Finding her water bottle , she had a drink . Back so soon ? asked Cloud , wickedly . " Very funny . I 'd like to see you leap through trees . " But I do n't try . That is why my kind has horse sense , and yours does not . Daine made a face at the mare and settled back against the willow . This time all she did was close her eyes , and she was inside Flicker . You can trust me , he said as he set out once more . I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip was a blur . Flicker used jumps as she might use large steps over puddles , whipping his tail for balance , then racing to the next leap . The trees were cut for a hundred yards around the fort , but the grass was tall enough to screen a gray squirrel . The fort 's log walls were easy to climb . At the top Daine made Flicker check for guards . The two they saw were distant and not looking their way : she urged him over . He dropped onto the walk and climbed headfirst to the ground as Daine cringed . You wo n't make a good squirrel at this rate , he informed her when they were safely on the ground . They checked the inner enclosure : it was nearly empty . Horses were picketed in front of a low wooden building Daine guessed to  | be the commander 's office . A horse-boy dozed near his charges under the single tree allowed to grow inside the wall . He was the only human in view , though they heard others in the buildings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As well as the mess and command post , she identified a stable , a building that had to be a barracks , and the privy . One other building had only a roof , three walls , and a long , low railing . Straw was scattered on the floor ; the rail was scarred with what looked like knife cuts . What 's that ? asked Flicker . It looks strange . I think it 's a Stormwing roost . They 're the only creatures big enough to need a rail that large to sit on . Flicker 's teeth chattered angrily . If they have their own perches like this , they had no business landing on my branch and almost killing me ! Too right . Now , let 's try the command post , she suggested . The squirrel raced to the closest building , the stable , and ran up the side . One leap : they were on the roof of the Stormwing mews . Even the wood between them could n't keep the reek from Flicker 's sensitive nose . He sneezed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the edge , he swung down under the eaves and saw a broad window . They climbed in and looked around . On the wall by the door , a large slate was mounted . Written across the top in white chalk was Duty Roster  --  Troops . Daine examined it . Thirty privates were listed , as well as three sergeants , three corporals , and a captain , making a total of thirty-seven . She counted twice , to be sure , then noticed papers in a stack on the desk . Let 's have a peek at those , she suggested to the squirrel . Flicker jumped onto the desk and picked up documents one at a time for Daine to read . The first two were supply orders ; the third was not . At its foot was a heavy wax seal that bore an image of a crossed sword and wand , topped by a crown and wrapped in a jagged circle . It was the seal of the emperor of Carthak : she knew it from histories and official papers Numair had shown her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The criminal Arram Draper , also known as Numair Salmalin , id to be taken alive and transported to Carthak by Stormwings.  | Try also to capture the young dragon . If this immortal is shipped to Us live for inclusion in Our menagerie , there will be a reward of 500 gold thaks . As to the dragons handles ; she is not required . Kill her The girl was so absorbed in her reading that she did n't notice something had darkened the window . When a wave of ' stench reached Flicker 's nostrils , he sneezed and turned . Rikash had landed on the rail outside and was looking in . " Well . A tree-rat . I think it 's odd , a tree-rat going through papers . It 's not the kind of thing you little crawlers usually do , is it ? " Flicker 's tail whipped savagely in anger and fear . Come here , he cried . I 'll show you what a " crawler " can do ! Rikash slid until he could block the window if he raised his wings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He yelled , " Humans to the command post ! Now , ground pounders , Now ! " Raising a claw , he pointed at Flicker . The floor ! Daine ordered . Flicker jumped as gold fire smacked into the spot where they had been standing . What was that ? asked the squirrel , breath coming fast . Magic . They do n't use it much , but when they do ... jump ! Flicker leaped atop a cabinet as another fire bolt struck his last position . I 'm getting angry , Smelly , he scolded . How would you like your nose bit off ? This is not the time to insult him , Daine warned , looking for an escape . She heard feet pounding : humans were answering Rikash 's summons . Their location had the Stormwing in a bind . His feathers got in the way as he tried to aim . What 's wrong ? taunted Flicker . Ca n't work yourself around to point ? But one of you was limber enough when it came to landing on me ! Someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ? " " Yes , you dolts ! " snarled Rikash . " Get in here now ! " " It 's locked ! " yelled the man outside . " Out of the way ! " the immortal cried . He could point at the door , and did , to loose a bolt of fire at the lock . Flicker jumped to the floor and ran over just as the door swung open . Three men , two of them cooks to judge from their aprons , dashed in.  | " Get that squirrel ! " shrieked Rikash as Flicker bolted past . The cooks gaped at him . " Get the what ? " The exit was open . Flicker darted though and raced for the fort 's wall . " Do n't argue with me ! It 's getting away ! " Rikash 's voice was clear even through the command post walls . The squirrel did n't even pause . By the time a search party could leave the fort , he had reached the woods and was scrambling through the trees . Daine returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something was not right with her feet or hands . They were squirrel paws . " Oh no , " she whispered . " Not now . " Looking up , she said , " Flicker , are you all right ? " The squirrel climbed down the willow . You should have let me bite the Great Stinky , he snapped . Then he 'd know what it 's like ! Looking her over , he remarked in a milder voice , You know , parts of you are almost normal . " Funny , " mumbled Daine . " Cloud , we have to go . I think Rikash will search for us . But ? " She looked at her hands and feet . They were still squirrel paws . " Please change back , " she said wistfully . Why ? asked the squirrel . You do n't have claws of your own  --  keep these . If they are hunting you , it might be wise to warn the local squirrels , Cloud remarked . They 'll just kill anyone they see , hoping it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She called to the nearby tree folk , whether they were red , gray , or the shy black breed . When she finished , all were finding places to hide , and her hands were human . Teetering on human-size , clawed feet supported by her boots , she saddled Cloud and mounted , with Flicker on her lap . They halted some hours south of the western pass when the light had gone . Stormwings had forced them under cover several times on the way : she dared not start a fire they might see . Instead she gnawed on waybread and jerky , trying to ignore a pounding headache . To complete her happiness , fog rose from the lake to cover the valley in a clammy shroud .  | Flicker cleaned out her supply of sunflower seeds , dug up and ate all the nuts other squirrels had cached within sight of ' their camp , and curled up in one of Daine 's packs to sleep . Daine shoved herself under a rock ledge to get out of the damp , and gingerly removed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still looked squirrelish . " When will I get my toes back ? " she asked Cloud . The mare liked fog no better than her rider . I am a pony , she snapped . You have to ask that question of someone who understands magic . I do not . ? So. ? Daine jumped , and banged her head on the rock over her . How the badger had crept up on her she could not begin to guess . ? I see you have learned the wider applications of the lesson I mentioned to you .  --  " You could have warned me , " she snapped , rubbing her scalp . " I thought I was losing my mind . " ? After the man said there was no madness in you ? If you can not trust your own instincts , you could at least trust laid . ? " He has no instincts , only things learned from books , " she grumbled .  --  Why do you day that ?  - -  The question brought her to a sudden boil . " He walked us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was being unfair , but could n't stop . " And evil mages . He got stuck on one side of a magic wall with me on the other . He wo n't use a word of ' power on it cause the word might cause a mess somewhere , which I do n't believe it will . Now I have to count soldiers at opposite ends of the valley . He thinks I 'm safe because I 'm inside Flicker . He did n't think of folk who 'd see a squirrel looking at papers and know something was amiss ! " Her toes hurt , sending darts of pain up her legs that did nothing to help her thinking . She rubbed them . " I 'm saddled with a two-legger who wo n't go home when she 's only in the way . I 'm running from Stormwings , hurroks , Coldfangs , and the Horse Lords know what else . I 'm cold and hungry and tired and I have squirrel feet ! " The badger breathed on the afflicted parts . His breath was warm and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | smooth : Daine 's toes were back . They cramped , and she winced . The badger breathed on them again . The cramps eased , and stopped . So did her headache . ? You have been a foolish kit , ? he informed her . ? To return to your original state , you must do the same thing you did to begin to change , only in reverse . You have to think yourself into your two-legger form . ? " Oh . " She drew on stockings and boots , feeling ridiculous . The badger sighed , and lay beside her . The weight and warmth of his furred body against hers was pleasant , and the heavy badger aroma was comforting . " No matter what I say , the wolves are doing terrible things , things that will get them hurt if they 're caught ! How can I help when they wo n't listen to me ? " ? You do n't grasp why you were brought here . Have n't you seen , in your travels , that you alone speak to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " No . Is that important ? " ? In other places , perhaps not . But here ... What do you think of this valley ? ? he asked , appearing to change the subject . She blinked . " Dunlath ? " He nodded regally . " Well , it 's ? nice . Lots of farmland , the lake for fishing , good forests  --  or they would be , if Yolane and Belden did n't rip the covering off to get at every drop of what 's under it . Except for mountain winters , Dunlath is almost perfect , not only for the People , but two-leggers . " She remembered the ogre falling at the mines , blood rolling down his back . " Maybe even immortals , too , if they wanted just to live here and raise families . " ? Now you see the shape of our plan . You were brought to help all of Dunlath , not just wolves . ? " That 's twice you 've said I was brought , like a cat in a sack . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came on my own two feet , and on Cloud 's four . " ? Were you not sum-prided to get a request for help from Brokefang ? Is it the nature of wolves to think to ask for help ? " Well , no ... Maybe ? " ? They do not ask their kinfolk . Pack mates already know what Li needed . And those beings who are not Pack are unimportant unless they serve as food . ? " But he changed , because he licked my wound ? "  | ? He did n't change that much , not in the beginning . ? " Well , then , why did he think to ask for me to come ? " '  - -  Old White suggested it . We thought that if you carne for the wolves , you would ease into the true matter , the problem of all Dunlath . I had hoped you would see for yourself what L required by now . ? Daine blushed , feeling absurdly guilty and stupid . " I 'm not a seer or a diviner , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't a crime . " The badger rumbled . ? Then here is the spelling . Fish , fowl , four-leggers , two-leggers , no-leggers , you are to set this whole valley to rights . She listened with dismay . How ? " she wailed . " I 'm fourteen ! Only fourteen ! How do I set everyone to rights ? Get someone bigger ! Get someone older ! " ? Someone older and bigger will not do . ? His voice was tightly patient . ? You are the only one for the task . If you were n't tired and wet and frightened , you would see it for yourself . ? " No I would n't , " she muttered rebelliously . " I still do n't ? " ? Shape a bridge between kindreds. ? He pressed his blunt head to her palm . ? Find allies , nzy kit  --  not just among the People , but among humans and immortals. ? Idly he added , ? How do you deal with the Stormwings , may I ask ? She made a face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are . They 're here in force , and it looks like they 're serving the Carthaki emperor once again . " ? It may be they have no choice . If hurroks can be bound to the service of humans , so can Stormwings . ? " Why is everyone I meet defending them ? You sound like Maura . " Remembering her friend 's behavior with the immortals , Daine snorted . " Though I 'll tell you , yesterday I almost felt sorry for Rikash and his crew . He wanted Maura to go home as bad as I do , but she said no , and he would n't make her . It was funny . " ? They sound almost like real people , not monsters . ? The bad-ger 's voice was so bland , so clean of any emotion , that Daine looked at him suspiciously . " What 's that supposed to mean ? " ? Nothing , young kit . ? Rising , he nudged her in the side , hard . ? Get some rest , then go to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cold ? ?  | " Goddess , no ! " Smiling , she added , " Thanks , Badger . " ? Stop feeling sorry for yourself , mind . My patience has its limits . ? As if to prove his point , he glared at the wide-eyed Flicker , who had listened to the entire conversation . ? What are you staring at , nibbler ? He did n't wait for a reply . Silver fire bloomed around him and he was gone . Badgers , Flicker remarked wearily . They always have to be wiser and grumpier than anyone else . The next day dawned gray and wet , a mixed blessing . It meant they did n't need to worry much about Stormwings or hurroks : they had trouble staying aloft with damp wings . However , she and her friends were also wet , which did nothing for moods . They were all aware of the long trip to the northern fort . " At least we can dry off ' and get some hot food here , " Daine told the others as they reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though . " When they entered the big cave , Maura squeaked and ran to hug Daine . " I 'm so glad you 're back ! " she whispered . " Are you done with your counting ? " Daine felt a guilty twinge . Her comments to the badger about a two-legger who got in her way felt as if they were branded on her forehead . " I have to do the northern fort yet , " she said . " How is everything here ? " Maura pulled away . " Fine , " she said , the tone of her voice falsely bright . " Tkaa 's teaching me'n Kitten ? " " Kitten and me , " Daine corrected automatically . " About rocks . You know , how you can tell what 's what . He teaches Kitten how to change them , too , but I ca n't make the noise . " ? Some of the wolves frighten her , ? said Tkaa , emerging from one of the rear caverns . Daine looked for the pack . The pups , napping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dozed off again . ? The gray-and-white female , Frostfur . The older male , Longwind . They do not harm her , but they watch her , and she knows it . The female growls if Maura comes too close . ? " Oh , dear . " Daine looked at the girl . " Tkaa says Frostfur and Longwind are upsetting you . "  | " Oh , no . " Maura 's eyes avoided Daine 's . " I hardly notice them . Fleetfoot and Russet are nice , and the pups will play with me . Would you like corn cakes ? I still have some batter . I made it from the food the pack brought . " Daine tended Cloud , feeding her the last barley and oats . Her pony cared for , she tried the cakes , and praised them . Flicker liked them , too , particularly with honey . It will be a shame to go back to the trees , he confided to Daine . I like the variety of food you have . You 'll get fat as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kitten 's hide . " Daine ? " Maura asked . " I was thinking , do n't you need help with your counting ? I could write numbers down for you . I would n't be in the way . " Dismay warred with pity . " We 've only one horse , " Daine said , " and I have to move fast . The only way you could go would be if we had a mount for both of us . I ca n't call your horse  --  he 's in his own stable by now . And there 's nothing else you can ride . " " A deer , maybe , or an elk ? No . I guess that 's a stupid idea . I 'm sorry . I did n't mean to bother you . I know you 'd rather I went home . " Daine winced . It was what she thought , but hearing it in that polite , well-bred voice made her feel like a bigger monster than a Stormwing . " If travel is the only problem , I may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will carry Lady Maura on my back . " Kitten whistled : the basilisk nodded . " You may ride in my pouch , Skysong . " Dumbfounded , Daine stared at the tall immortal . He looked no stronger than a birch sapling . " Impossible . " " You of all people should know better than to use that word , " reproved Tkaa . " Even if you could carry both , which I doubt , you could n't keep up . " " I do not see how so young a mortal came to believe she knows all there is to be known of immortals . I would not offer if I felt I could not do it . " Daine was a well-mannered girl , but she liked being talked  | down to no better than any other teenager . " Very well , " she said , standing . " If you can fit Kitten in your pouch , carry Maura piggy-back , and keep up with me and Cloud  --  " " Cloud and me , " Maura interrupted . She blushed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face at her . " ? then you 're welcome to come , " the older girl finished , feeling beset on all sides . " But if you fall behind , I wo n't linger for you . " Before they had been on the trail more than an hour , Tkaa caught up to Cloud , Daine , and Flicker and passed them . Maura drooped over his shoulder , sound asleep . Kitten sat up in his pouch , watching the trail . They traveled all day , getting soaked as the damp turned to rain , At midafternoon they passed the cliff where Daine had first seen the mines . She sighed . That spot would have been good to work from if she only had to listen to the fort 's animals , but she wanted to be closer before Flicker went there . She was- n't sure how far her new magic would stretch . So they followed the mountains farther north , around the fields of heaped and barren dirt . Tkaa found a wooded ridge that overlooked the fort . It was ideal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daine was sure lived in the northern fort . Also , a line of rock formed a clear path from the base of their ridge to within fifty yards of the palisade . Flicker agreed . Easy as eating corn , he told her . Using branches and a fallen log over a pocket in the earth , Daine and Maura built a rough shelter where Tkaa , Kitten , and the girl could sit out of the wet . Daine unsaddled Cloud . As she did so , Maura , Kitten , and Tkaa returned to the ridge , looking not at the fort , but at the mines . The weather might have been damp and miserable , but operations below were in full swing . Human and ogre workers labored in thick mud while overseers cursed those who fell . When Daine joined them , Maura said quietly , " These poor ogres are ugly . " " I do n't know , " replied Daine . " At least they 're of a piece , all one thing . They prob'ly think we 're funny looking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't hate them ? But I hear so many stories . Outside the valley they fight with humans all the time . It 's said the King 's Champion lives in the saddle these days because she 's always battling them . " Daine shrugged . " It 's not so bad . Lady Alanna does n't always fight them . Ogres just do n't understand they ca n't take things that belong to others . " Since her talk with the badger , she had done a great deal of thinking . " I wonder  --  if humans did n't attack and tried to be nice , maybe ogres would n't be so nasty . " She pointed at the mines . " And I know one thing for certain . This is just plain wrong . Look at their ribs  --  you could count them . When d' you suppose they had their last meal ? And whatever it was , it ca n't have been much . " Maura stared at the scene below , small face unreadable . Come on , Flicker said . We 'll have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hate the dark . Can we get moving , before we have to do it all in the dark ? " I have to go , " Daine told the others . " Keep your heads down while you 're here , and get under cover soon . No fire , mind , and talk softly . " Tkaa looked at her . " We will be fine . I will keep the little ones safe . " Daine smiled . " I know you will . " Seated in a corner of the shelter , Daine shut her eyes and entered Flicker 's mind . The squirrel 's hide itched with anxiety over the coming of night . He scratched , then clambered down the ridge to the line of rock . The mine workers were trudging home as Flicker reached the fort . Daine was glad to find a chink where the log palisade met the ground : she had not liked the idea of climbing up when they could be seen by those being herded past . Once inside the wall , Flicker scaled one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met the platform floor . What is that building over there , the newish one ? he wanted to know . It has a terrible smell . She peered at the structure he meant . It was set apart from the other buildings in the enclosure . Built like a stable , its doors extended from ground to roof . When the wind blew from its  | direction , a scent of hay , dead meat , and rage , one she had first smelled as a bat , filled the air . Hurrok stables , she told Flicker . They patrol this part of the valley . They 're nasty . Lucky for us , I do n't think they can fly in weather like this . She examined the rest of the fort . It was larger than the one in the south , and older  --  no doubt it had been here before the mining began . There were painted shutters open on the buildings ' windows . The men wore the uniform of Maura 's house , green tunic over gray shirt and breeches , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green two-headed griffin on a gray field . Stands to reason that it 's fancier , she told Flicker . Most local visitors must come from the north , from the City of the Gods or Fief Aili . Only traders come in from the south . The sun is gain ! ) , the squirrel replied . I 'm afraid we have to let it go , she said , as kindly as possible . That room with the light in it looks to be the commander 's office , like the one we visited in the south . We have to wait for him to leave , and that probably wo n't be till it 's time to eat . Look at it this way  --  at least we 're out of the rain . We 're going back to our friends in the dark ? asked Flicker . We must . He sighed . I know you would n't ask it of me if it were n't important . I just bate the dark . The meager daylight was gone and torches were lit when the mess call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued to burn , but the commander emerged to join the flow of men to the mess . Daine and Flicker waited until everyone but the guards in the towers had left the yard , then raced to the headquarters . Swiftly they climbed in the window through an open shutter . Like its counterpart , this fort had slates with the duty roster nicely laid out in white chalk . I love soldiers , Daine confided to Flicker . They always try to do things the same as every other soldier . She read what was on the board , counting forty soldiers , four corporals , four sergeants , one captain . More soldiers because of the two-leggers entering this way ? asked Flicker . Has to be , she replied . Come on . Let 's get out of here . Their return took longer than the trip out . Flicker was  | almost as blind in the dark as a human , and more nervous than Daine had ever seen him . Each rustle and squeak was an owl , a bear , a bush dog , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him along as patiently as she knew how . Flicker had done great things for her , things no squirrel would dream of , and that knowledge kept her gentle when he made one of his many stops to hide . She stayed with him up the face of the ridge and over its edge , rather than leaving him to do it alone . He nearly expired when a huge shadow moved and snorted . Hello , squirrel , said Cloud . Bad night ? Flicker sat down against a tree bole , shuddering . It was terrible , he told the pony . How can you stand walking in the dark ? Daine knew Cloud would ease the squirrel 's shattered nerves if the two were alone , so she thanked Flicker again and left him , to open her eyes in the shelter . There was no light anywhere , only noises , the sounds of large bodies moving nearby . Nervous , she looked around , ears twitching . Now she could see a little , but what she saw was not reassuring . Two monstrous shapes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thin , the other wide across the shoulders and slumped . Between them was a smaller but still big shape . A whistle by one of her ears nearly deafened her , and a face thrust itself near hers . It was long and sharp-toothed on the end . Large , faintly glowing eyes with catlike pupils looked her over . She squeaked and tried to back away . The smaller of the big shapes turned , showing a face like a pale blur in the darkness . Its owner crawled toward Daine on hands and knees . It was very strange to find Maura so much bigger than she was . " Oh , dear , " the girl said . " Uh  --  Daine , you , um , you shrank . " Tell me something I do n't know , Daine said : it came out as angry squirrel chatter . She looked at her hands and feet . They were still human , but a fine gray fuzz covered them , and the tips of her nails were now black claws . She closed her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was easier to remember her wolf self , or her bat self . Who was she ? An image appeared before her eyes , a pool of copper fire  | with a central core of white light . Between core and pool lay a wall of clear power , like glass , flickering with sparks of white and black fire . The white core was her inner self ; the sparkling wall was the barrier Numair once put between her self and her magic , to stop her from forgetting her humanity . Start there , she thought . She found memories of Ma , of Grandda , of the house where she grew up . Next were the Snowsdale humans who tried to kill her for running with wolves . She saw Onua , who gave her work in Galla and a home in Tortall . Here were others who filled important places in her life , a mixed bag of nobles , commoners , warriors , and animals . So that 's who I am , she thought , pleased to have so much that was good in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maura sat with her back to Daine . " I ca n't look anymore , " she was saying . " Tell me when she 's done . " The nearby , cat-eyed shape was Kitten , who made a questioning sound . Daine lifted the dragon into her lap , then looked at the bigger shapes at the opening of the shelter . One was unmistakably Tkaa . The other was a stranger . " I 'm done , " she announced . Maura turned and gasped . " You 're you ! I mean , you were always you , but you were starting to look kind of -- squirrelish . " I 'm sorry I missed that , commented Flicker from outside the shelter . Tkaa said , " It is good you have returned . We have a guest . lakoju , this is Daine , the human Maura spoke of . " The stranger nodded . She was an ogre , clad only in a short , ragged tunic in spite of the damp . " Are you cold ? " Daine asked . " We have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to the immortal . " I said Daine would welcome her , " Maura informed Tkaa . To Daine she added , " Iakoju 's our friend . She wants to help us get rid of Yolane and Tristan . " lakoju stared at the blanket , pointed ears twitching back and forth . At last she took it . " Thank you , " she said quietly , and bowed from the Waist .  | Maura helped the ogre drape the blanket around her shoulders . " She 's running away , " the ten-year-old explained . Placid eyes met Daine 's without blinking . Despite skinniness and poor clothes Iakoju was clean , and smelled of soap , earth , and something vaguely spicy . Daine sniffed , trying to identify the spice odor . " Are you eating something ? " Iakoju smiled . " Maura give me candy . " Maura blushed . " Well , she looked so scared when I found her , and I remembered what you said , about people being mean to them and maybe if somebody was nice ... " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daine . " Did you succeed at your mission ? " asked Tkaa . Daine nodded and found her water canteen . Politely she offered it first to Iakoju , who shook her head and held up a gourd water bottle of her own . As Daine drank , Maura said , " Iakoju thinks some of the ogres will help us . " " Why ? " Daine sat by Tkaa , where she could see their guest . Kitten and Flicker joined her , Flicker curling up on one shoulder , Kitten on her lap . " Stormwings and Tristan lie , " Iakoju said flatly . " They say , come through gate , we give you farms to keep , so we come . Only farms here are rock farms , under ground . We say , do n't want mines , where are farms ? Tristan say , you farm what we say farm . " She scowled . " Ogres are angry . They send me from valley to find kin clans . Kin clans come help , bash lying men on the head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She slid him into the crook of her arm and asked , " Did n't you have farms in the Divine Realms ? " Iakoju shook her head . " Too many ogres . No room . We come here for farms . " Maura frowned . " I do n't understand . If you 're peaceful  --  if you really only like to farm  --  how come you 're called ogres ' ? Ogres are monsters , are n't they ? And how come your people are always fighting with ours ? " " We are big , " replied Iakoju quietly . " Ugly . Our color different from men color . Not all ogres are same , either . Some take what they want . Some fight with men . My people , kin clans , we only like farming , not fighting . Some ogres only like fighting . Are all men the same ? "  | " No , " Daine said thoughtfully . " Of course not . " Maura poked the dirt with a stick . " It 's a shame the lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too steep . " Daine sensed what her young friend had in mind . " The fief is Yolane 's . I do n't think she 'll approve of ogre farms on the east shore . " " Under law she forfeits her lands for treason , " argued the ten-year-old . " And the fief is n't all hers . Half is mine  --  Papa willed it to me , and maybe the king would let me keep it . The way it was supposed to be , Yolane would buy my half when it came time for me to marry , so it 's my dowry . That 's why I got the eastern half . It 's mostly uphill , though , " she said with a sigh . Iakoju 's eyes lit . " We make farms . Find ridge , dig out cup , pour in growing dirt . Make small valleys up and down , grow corn , beans , flowers . Peas , herbs  --  we like growing . If ogres help you , will you give us farms ? " " Maura can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be she will lose the land . Her sister , whose holding this is , plots against the Crown . " " Tkaa 's right , " Maura told Iakoju , hanging her head . " I guess I ca n't promise , not if it might not come true . " The ogre looked at her , at the basilisk , then at Daine . Her mouth curved in a smile . " Maybe I do n't leave Dunlath . I go with you instead . We will talk . " Daine was about to object , and changed her mind . The badger 's words were still very fresh in her memory . In any event , it could n't hurt . Before she slept , she wrote a report for Numair , using a glowstone from her belt-purse as her light . Once the report was done , she napped uneasily , dreaming of hurroks . The company awoke at dawn . The clouds had gone , and the day promised to be lovely . Daine 's enjoyment of its beauty was soured by the knowledge that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , We had best take another route to the pass , one with lots-of trees . Iakoju will stand out like a bear in a puddle . A nearby stag told Daine of trails lower on the slopes , ones that skirted the mines.and lumber camp and passed almost entirely under the trees . She led the way to them with a thankyou to the stag . The tip was a good one . The path was wide and  | much-used , taking advantage of every bit of cover the forest provided , perfect for much-hunted animals like deer . As the morning ended , the path took them by the round meadow , past Flicker 's tree and the Coldfang statue . Daine passed it with a shudder . Twice since meeting the creature she had awakened with a pounding heart , sweat-damp hair , and the feeling that something icy advanced on her , slowly and relentlessly . She would be glad if she never saw another live Coldfang , and it pleased her to leave the stone one behind . One other fear , that Flicker might choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of returning to his home . An hour later she heard an animal 's call and signaled for the others to halt . Where are you ? she asked . What do you want ? A dog broke from the pines fifty yards ahead and raced up to her . It was the huntsman 's head dog , one of the wolfhounds Daine had met at the castle . Dismounting , she said , " I 'm sorry  --  I did n't get your name , before . " I am Prettyfoot , the dog replied . Daine covered a smile with her hand . It is the name the man gave me , the wolfhound insisted . It is a good name . " It 's a lovely name , " Daine replied soothingly . " How may I help you ? " Please come , the hound begged . The man is hurt . The wolves did it . Daine looked at her friends . " Something 's up . I have to go with this dog . " To Prettyfoot she said , Is it complicated ? Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know if you can help at all , Prettyfoot said , dark eyes sad under wiry brows . Our pack could do nothing . " Tkaa , will you take this to Numair ? " Daine asked , pulling the letter she had written from her shirt . " I think the sooner he gets it , the better . " " Very wise , " the basilisk said , lifting Kitten from his pouch . " When it is delivered , I will walk back this way to find you again . " He took the letter and set off down the trail , long legs carrying him quickly out of sight . " We go with dog now ? " asked Iakoju.  | Daine nodded . " His master 's in trouble , he says . " " Tait ? " Maura said , alarmed . " Then what 're we waiting for ? " Prettyfoot led them onto a new trail , explaining that his pack had been calling for help for a day and a night . No matter what they or the man did , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In a small , rough clearing crossed by the trail , they found the rest of Tait 's dogs beside a pit . They came running to bark greetings to her and Maura . Going to the rim of the hole , Daine peered in . Tait , coated in mud , leaves , and filth , sat at the bottom . Suddenly she knew what the wolves ' plan for Tait had been . " Huntsman , " she said . " You 're in a fix . " " Laugh all ye like , girly , " he said tiredly , " but get me out of here . " " I do n't know , " she drawled . " May I ask if this was a wolf pit , to start ? " " It was a lot smaller ! " he bellowed . " And the trail marks I put here t ' tell me where the damned thing was got moved ! If that was your work ? " " I have n't been next or nigh this spot , " she retorted , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was tempted to leave him there . Maura had told her , during the morning 's ride , that Tait had killed the last wolf pack to live in Dunlath . Do not be angry , begged Prettyfoot . He is cold and wet and hungry . And he ernelLi . Daine turned to Iakoju . " I have a rope . Can you pull him out ? " The ogre went to the rim of the hole and leaned over . A sound like a yelp rose from the pit . " It 's all right , Tait , " called Maura , trotting over to stand next to the large , aqua-skinned immortal . " She 's with me . " " Lady Maura ? " the captive said . " What kind of company are ye keepin ' now ? " The ten-year-old scowled . " Better company than is at home , " she snapped . " And what 's that supposed to mean , miss ? " " Never mind . I 'll tell you later . " Iakoju looked at Daine and nodded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "  | With a sign , Daine got the rope and gave it to Iakoju . " I 'm not doing this for you , Tait , " Daine called . " I 'm doing it for your dogs . " " I do n't care who ye do it fer , long as ye do it afore I turn gray ! " Iakoju took several turns of rope around her waist and dropped the free end into the pit . Tait wrapped it around his waist in the same manner , and grabbed the rope between them with both hands . " Haul away ! " he yelled . Iakoju backed up . With some cursing on Tait 's part , she dragged the hunter from his prison . The moment he was on solid ground , the wolfhounds surrounded him , yipping their pleasure as they nuzzled him . Seeing him up close , Daine winced . The pit did n't seem to be the cleanest spot in the forest . Tait now smelled greatly of wolf urine and dung . " Have ye water ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be fair nice . " Maura gave him Daine 's canteen . The first gulp went to rinse his mouth ; the rest went into his belly . " Weiryn 's Horn , " he gasped , " I needed that . " Maura offered him sliced ham and cheese . He shoved the cheese into his mouth as the dogs watched , licking their chops . " Ye should n't be here , " he said when his mouth was empty . He looked at Daine and lakoju . " No offense meant . " " Berate her all you like , " Daine replied . " If you can make her go home , it 's more than I could do , or that Stormwing lord . " " Things are crazy here now , " the man grumbled . " The lords do n't care for land or people , bringin ' monsters t ' keep their servants in fear .... " Shaking his head , he tore the ham up and gave it to his dogs . Seeing that Daine watched him , he looked down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he growled . " M ' throat 's that sore from bellowin ' . " Why , you softy , thought the girl . She got more cheese and two apples , and gave them to him . For the dogs she cut up the rest of the ham . " Kind of ye , " muttered the huntsman . " They 're good dogs , " she replied shyly . " They really love you , you know . " " I know . They could 've left me , but they did n't . They run off a bear last night , when it wanted t ' come a-callin ' . " He  | looked at Iakoju . " Give a man a hand up ? " he asked . " M ' legs went t ' sleep , bein ' cramped down there . " The ogre held Tait by the elbows and lifted until he got his feet under him . He winced . " I need t ' get this stink off me . " He looked from Maura to Daine . " Will ye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such hid by a stream nearby . I came out here with no plans to go back . Do n't like what 's happenin ' in that castle these days . " Daine smiled . With luck , she had another recruit . " Go ahead . We 'll wait for you . " With Iakoju to lean on and the dogs frisking around him , Tait hopped off to his bath . As they passed out of sight , Daine heard him tell the ogre , " No peekin ' once I 'm out of my clothes , mind . " " I want to check something , " Daine told Maura . " Do n't stray . " She leaned against a tree and closed her eyes . Finding an eagle , she got permission to enter his mind . From the spot where he glided in the warm air that rose from the trees she could see glimpses of Tkaa . The basilisk was on all fours and galloping , his long , delicate limbs taking him faster than she would have believed possible . He was close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon reach Numair , she let the eagle take her where he wished . He flew low to avoid the barrier overhead , but he was still high enough to have a good view of the valley 's heart . Not far from Tait 's pit Daine glimpsed the lumber camp . The wolves , it seemed , had achieved their aim . All work was at a halt . The camp was nearly empty ; the few humans there lay idly about or walked lazily around the area . The eagle then flew south . Below lay the village and the castle , like toys . Smoke of an ugly green-brown color billowed out of a tower window in the castle . Every flying creature gave the weirdly colored plume a wide berth . Why ? Daine asked the eagle . I do not need to fly through death to know what it looks like , replied her host . I do not have to bathe in danger when I know what it smells like . There is always something bad going on in that tower . We 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's almost over .  | Good , replied the eagle . Tell me if you need help , and I will give it . When the bird wheeled north , Daine saw trouble . Three creatures flew in criss-crossing patterns along the slopes where she had been the night before . The eagle squinted , and shapes came into focus : the bodies and heads of horses , batlike wings as big as sails . The hurroks worked their way south , skimming above the treetops . They were hunting for something , and she had an unhappy idea of what it might be . I have to go , she told the eagle hastily . Thank you ! She opened human eyes . Something huge and brown filled her vision and surprised her into a yelp that came out a keening screech . I wish this would happen when I need it , not when I 'm rushed ! she thought peevishly , and blinked . The brown thing moved to show a patch of hairy skin . Trying to rush the change was not going to work . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She thought of nights in the Rider barracks hearing stories , of sword practice with the King 's Champion , and of stargazing at Numair 's tower . Under her memories now she felt talons become feet , and wings become arms . When she opened her eyes this time , Tait sat beside her , a golden brown feather in his hand . It was his rough tunic and skin that had seemed so close . " Sorry . Did n't mean t ' scare ye , lass . " He offered her the feather . " Ye lost one . Actually , ye lost a few . Maura 's got one . " Daine looked around and saw only Kitten and Prettyfoot . " Where is she ? " " lakoju took her fishin ' . " Raising her voice a bit , she said , " Kitten , get Maura and lakoju . Hurroks are searching the valley  --  they 're coming this way . " To the man she said , " Is there cover around here ? " " The laurel bushes can hide Maura and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a willow by the stream for Iakoju and the pony . The dogs can go where they like ? I do n't think the hunters will care about them . " The ogre and Maura came at a run . All of them listened as Daine explained where to hide . They hid their belongings , too . Daine kept her crossbow and quiver . Tait had a bow of his  | own , a fine weapon polished and supple with much use . He strung it quickly . " They hunt me . " Iakoju 's eyes , the dark green of oak leaves , were sad . " They count us in morning , before work . My brother supposed to say I am sick . " " I guess they didna believe him , lass , " Tait said , patting the ogre 's arm . " Not yer fault . Get under cover . We 'll sing out when all 's clear . " lakoju tramped off toward the stream with Cloud and Tait 's dogs behind her . Daine pointed to a spot where a fallen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dirt underneath had worn away , leaving a hollow . From that spot they would be able to see the clump of laurel and the stream . Tait nodded and followed her to it . Flicker was already there , sunning himself on the log . Sitting next to the huntsman , Daine put an arrow in the crossbow 's notch and secured it , then placed it at her side , ready to fire  --  just in case . At the limits of her awareness came the first tingling sense that hurroks were near . Tait had tucked the eagle feather behind his ear . Now he ran it through his fingers thoughtfully . " Can ye change entire ? " " No , " the girl replied , fingering the badger 's claw around her neck . " I ca n't even control what changes . I just learned how to turn myself all human again the night before last . " " Aye . Maura said at first ye thought ye were mad . " Tait 's brown eyes met hers . " She told me why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say I 'd no idea treason was afoot ? I knew things was strange  --  that 's why I left . But treason . . . That 's worse than I thought . " Daine studied him . His was a square , stubborn face . He looked as if he would be as bad a liar as she was herself . " Yes , " she replied , and smiled . He smiled back . " Truthfully , I 'm as glad she 's here and not home . I do n't think Tristan has the grip on what 's goin ' on that he thinks he does . " " What do you mean ? " The man teased Flicker with his feather as the squirrel tried playfully to grab it . " Two days ago I was in the courtyard when the female mage , Gissa , came out screamin ' . She was holdin '  | her wrist like her hand turned into a serpent , yellin ' fer someone t " take it off . ' I saw a wee drop of red on th ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and red streaks was growin ' on the back toward the wrist , like they do when a wound 's gone bad . Tristan and Master Gardiner was on the steps , and they just stared at her . " Sweat appeared on Tait 's forehead . " So she run t ' th ' woodpile , grabbed th ' ax , and chopped her hand off . " Daine stared at him . " She cut off her own hand ? " " Weiryn leave me hungry if I lie . " He wiped his face on his sleeve . " Praise the Goddess the lass was n't there . She'd 've had nightmares for months , what with the blood and Tristan not carin ' about Gissa , but yellin ' if she let ' it ' boil over they were all dead . He run inside  --  did n't even try t ' help Gardiner make the wrist stop bleedin ' . He ? " Daine put a finger to her lips , then pointed up . A large , winged shape passed overhead , its shadow falling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt the other hurroks , their presence tainted , as always , with rage . They remained directly above for some time before moving higher on the mountainsides . " I think if we 're quiet , they wo n't hear us , " she whispered . " They 've gone off a ways , but they might come back . " " Ye can tell where they are ? " " When they 're in range . " " More witchcraft , then ? " " Yes , " she replied , and he shook his head . She knew this attitude too well . Some people were uncomfortable with magic ; the more things they heard she could do , the more uncomfortable they became . Rather than argue , she changed the subject . " Who 's this ' Weiryn ' ? " she whispered . " You mention him all the time , and I do n't think I ever heard of him . " " A mountain god of the hunt . He 's rooted in the forest and rock , kin to all that walks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him pass in the woods , with his hounds . Got antlers like a deer , he does . All us huntsmen swear by ' im . " Something about that description was familiar , but she could n't place it . " I never had much to do with huntsmen at home . Well , they did n't have much to do with me . Have you heard of my village , in Galla ? Snowsdale ? "  | The look he gave her was thoughtful , and very sharp . " So ye ' re that one . " Daine felt herself turning red . " I do n't know what you 've heard , but it 's prob'ly blown way out of proportion . " " Not after what I 've seen today , " the man said , and grinned . They waited for a long time . As they waited , Daine filled ' fait in on all she knew , from the wolves ' summons to the orders she 'd seen from Carthak . Just as she thought the hurroks were going , she sensed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the others and warned them the danger was not over . As she rejoined Tait , screams and snarls exploded overhead . It seemed hurroks and Stormwings did not get along . " We could get old here , " she whispered to Tait . " What are they looking for ? " " The dragon , perhaps ? " She winced . " Kitten . It figures . " She made herself relax , and took a nap . When she woke , the Stormwings and hurroks were gone , and Tkaa had returned . They all left their hiding places , hungry and stiff . While Maura introduced Tkaa to the huntsman , Daine did some thinking . She did not like the story of ' Gissa 's hand , not after seeing that oddly colored smoke over the castle . What were the mages brewing there  --  more trouble , like the barrier ? A touch on her arm was the basilisk . ? I am to tell you sot Nov are at the southern gate to the valley . Also , the King 's Champion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . Master Numair days that should cheer you up . ? Hope surged in her mind , and she asked silently , Can he break the barrier with Lady Alanna 's help ? She 's a fair powerful rnage . ? He said you would ask . He and the Lioness can not break this working . It continues to absorb what power they strike it with , not reflect it . No triages can be spared from the City of the Gods . Some are riding here from the south , and will be here in four days . ? The girl shook her head . With Tristan up to something , she was n't sure they had four days . She had to know more , and that meant entering the castle . It took time to convince the others to push on without her .  | At last they agreed to move on toward the western pass until dark , then camp , while she and Cloud rode to a spot near the village . No one liked that decision , but Daine 's growing fear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tkaa , Iakoju , and Tait could not keep Maura and Kitten safe , no one could , and only she could wander the castle with no one the wiser . Cloud worked hard to reach a place near the village before sunset . Twilight had fallen when they halted inside the trees on the town 's fringe . Murmuring compliments , Daine rubbed her friend down . Stop that , Cloud said when she was dry and clean . Go do what you must . Daine opened her bedroll and lay down under the trees . I do n't know how long this will take , she warned her friend . Cloud was nibbling the grass that grew close by and did not answer . Daine 's magic flowed out readily , reaching the castle before she had taken more than two deep breaths . Inside its walls she found horses , goats , chickens , geese , and pigs , all nice animals in their way ( although she detested chickens ) , but ill-suited to a search in a human dwelling . She was nearly resigned to asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be seen . Then , in the kitchen garden , she found two cats . She approached the elder , a fat , dignified torn who busily washed the inky black fur of a cat not far out of kittenhood . Since the younger cat objected to the tom 's vigorous methods , he kept her in place with a powerful forepaw as he cleaned her white bib . When Daine interrupted , he stopped washing , but kept his grip on the younger cat as Daine politely explained her errand . The tom  --  named by men Blueness  --  listened with interest . When she finished , he inspected his claws . I am not sure that I am the cat you need , he told her . There are nooks and crannies where a creature of my noble bulk may not go . He looked at the other cat . You take the Scrap , here . Even for a kitten she is most inquisitive , and she can get into anything . Say yes , pleaded Scrap . Please ! Daine had to smile . Thank you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or I will wash you again . I can wash myself , the young cat retorted . Not as well as I can , the tom replied . Now sit quietly while l ) nine does whatever she must to ride with you . Daine turned her attention to Scrap , hearing the cat 's eyes blink , and the soft pound of her heart . Are you here yet ? asked Scrap , breaking Daine 's concen-tration . No , Daine said . Almost . Hold still , and hush . She listened . That was the sigh of Scrap 's lungs , and her heartbeat . Her stomach growled softly , digesting milk a cook had left unattended . Scrap yawned . Well ? she demanded . Are you ready ? Now you know what I put up with , muttered Blueness . Daine focused hard , and Scrap gave a squeak . Now the two of them scratched an itch , and looked at Blueness with Scrap 's eyes . He was the most handsome tom she knew , his glossy fur a mix of pure white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow him anywhere , particularly if she could attack his tail . She pounced . Blueness , with the ease of practice , whipped the tail clear and gave her a solid cuff with his forepaw . Come on , Daine said , and showed Scrap images of Tristan , Yolane , Belden , and the other mages . I 'm looking for them . I can find them , but the female will screech and throw things if she sees me , Scrap replied . Then do n't let her see you , Blueness ordered . Daine , keep her safe . I will , and thank you , Daine called as they galloped through the kitchen . Why is he named Blueness ? she asked as they trotted up a long flight of stairs . My mama said when he was my age , he fell into a bowl of color the cook uses on food , and he came out all blue . I ca n't believe he would be that undignified , but that 's what my mama said , and she knows everything . Here we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others visit him here . " I ca n't fit the hand if you wo n't hold still , " a man-was say-  | ing as Scrap entered . She went under a table and peered out . The room was big , with shelves of books along the walls and silk carpets to cushion feet from the stone floor . Scrap , heedless of the expense or quality of the carpet that extended under the table , kneaded it luxuriously , sharpening her claws . Daine examined the humans . The mage Redfern sat with Gissa of Rachne on a sofa . He worked on a metal skeleton hand fixed to the stump of the mage 's wrist , making tiny adjustments to it with instruments from the table before them . Gardiner leaned against the sofa 's back , watching with interest . " If Gardiner and Master Staghorn had kept their wits about them , this would n't be necessary ! " snapped the woman . Pain had aged her face ten years . " Recriminations are due on your side of the ledger , Gissa . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daine thought , and she was right . He sat in a chair beside the table where she had taken refuge . " You are no greenling , fresh from the country . Letting bloodrain splash as you stirred it was ? " " Tristan ! " cried a feminine voice . The door opened and humans entered . Scrap looked out cautiously , and Daine saw Yolane , Belden , and Alamid . " Tristan , Alamid showed us the warriors at the southern pass in his crystal . That 's the King 's Chainpion out there , and the Knight Commander of the King 's Own ! " " Alamid should n't worry you with minutiae . " There was more than a hint of poison , and meaning , in Tristan 's voice . " Minutiae ? " cried Yolane . " The Lioness and Raoul of Goldenlake are minutiae ? " Tristan sighed . " My dear Yolane , calm down . " He went to a wine table and filled the goblets there , bringing one to her and keeping one . " If I faced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mastered , I might feel some concern . I am not such a fool . Believe me , we were prepared for this . In three days they will cease to be even a mild irritation . " Belden went to the wine table , drank the contents of one of the goblets Tristan had filled , and poured himself a second drink . " Why ? "  | " My colleagues and I have prepared a little something to welcome the king 's representatives . It 's called ' bloodrain . ' You might say Gissa already tested the brew for us , and that was before it reached its full potential . " She cut off her own hand , " Belden said . " It was my hand or my life , " snapped the female mage . " If the poison had gotten into my blood , I would have rotted from the inside out . " But how will you poison them ? " Yolane asked . She finally sat down in the room 's biggest chair . " Surely they 'll have magical protections on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm , sipping his wine . " I do n't plan to go near them . At sunset the day after tomorrow , I will take the bloodrain to the southern pass , where the river runs through the barrier , and dump it in . " Gardiner shivered . " By sunrise of the next day , there wo n't be a living soul in that camp . " " Or anywhere else for ten miles , " Gardiner said . Yolane looked at him . " What is that supposed to mean ? " " Bloodrain will kill anything that uses moisture from the river . " The cold , metallic voice was Alamid 's . " Animals , plants  --  it does n't matter . The zone of destruction will extend nearly five miles on each side of the river , and ten miles down-stream . " All the hair on the cat 's ? Daine 's ? back stood up . " For how long ? " Belden finished his second cup of wine and poured a third . " The effects begin to fade after seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's necessary , " Tristan said firmly . " Our departure for the capital is scheduled for a week from today . Nothing can be permitted to interfere . " " What if they 're warned ? " demanded Yolane . " They might withdraw . " " If they do , they should meet the two companies of mercenaries we have been keeping across the Gallan border , " replied Tristan . " I took the liberty of calling them up in your name , and they will be at the southern gate in three days . Gardiner , tell Rikash to warn Captain Blackthorn to bring his own food and water supplies . "  | " And Numair Salmalin ? " Belden 's drinking had n't affected his hands or voice as he poured another refill . " He 's still in the western pass , is n't he ? " " I have a net I will use to bottle him up . The emperor wants him alive . It is alwayi a good idea to give His Imperial Highness what he wants . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white under her makeup . " I swore an oath to keep Dunlath safe , when my father gave me his signet . This bloodrain ? " " My dear , you are overscrupulous . " Belden 's tone was scornful . " It is n't going to kill anything in Dunlath proper , is it ? And what will you care , once you sit on Jonathan 's throne ? Dunlath is a long way from Corus . Besides , you heard Master Staghorn . It will all grow back in less than a decade . " Tristan picked up one of Yolane 's hands and kissed it . " Yolane , leave command decisions to your generals . As queen , you must get used to sacrificing the lives of a few for the good of all . Think of this as a masterly stroke , which it is . In one move you deprive the king of his champion and the commander of his most personal guard . Those are tactics you need . You have to convince not only your enemies , but your allies , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Gissa added , accented voice quite dry , " once they see what is left of those who interfered with you here , they will hurt themselves for the chance to be the first to swear to you . " Yolane looked at all the mages , frowning . " Why does it have to wait two whole days ? Why ca n't you kill them now ? " " Bloodrain takes time , " Redfern told her . " Once combined , the ingredients must brew for three full days and three full nights . " Tristan smiled at Yolane in a way Daine thought Belden should object to . " You see , Majesty ? Everything is under control . You chose your generals well . " Yolane looked as if she were about to object again , but Tristan put his finger to her lips . She sighed and looked around the room . Her eyes rested on Daine , and her mouth went tight . Picking up her goblet , she hurled it at Scrap , who ducked out  | the door , soaked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll kill it ! " Daine heard her snarl as Scrap raced down the stair . Now Blueness will wash me again , the youngster told I ) aine with a sigh . Did you hear what you wanted to ? I heard too much , replied Daine . I think I have to go . Thank you . A lot of people will owe their lives to you for this . She fled to her body , scrambling to rethink herself human . She succeeded only partly  --  there were claws on her hands and she appeared to have a tail  --  but at least she was almost normal size as she entered her skin . Rolling up her bed , she jammed it under some bushes , thinking fast . Could she build wings for herself and fly up to Numair ? You will tire and fall , Cloud informed her . Use common sense . If you are in a hurry to get to Numair , take the way you know best . But do n't ride me  --  I 'm not up to a mad dash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the big horses from the village . I will follow you as quickly as I can . Daine nibbled a fingernail and winced as the claw dug into her lip . I hate to steal , she admitted . But I think I must . She sent out an urgent call . A large , bony horse grazing nearby came racing over . You want the fastest horse in this valley , he told her . I am the one . Daine heard the other village horses agree : Rebel was the best at running . You do n't look like much to me , Cloud said , looking the stallion over . Rebel snorted . That is what everyone thinks . That is why my man wins money when he races me against strangers , and that is why I am fed oats every day . I am not impressed by your oat ration , Cloud retorted . Seeing that Daine was about to mount , she said , Do n't forget your pack , or the crossbow . Daine slung the pack over one shoulder and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crossbow 's notch and clipping it in place . Satisfied ? she asked the pony . And do n't take any sauce from this jackanapes . I will follow soon . Daine had ridden fast horses in the king 's service and with  | the Riders , but none matched Rebel . The ride through the village , past the crossroads , and onto the road to the western pass left her breathless . Once the last farmhouse was behind them , Daine began to call for Tkaa , Tait 's dogs , and the pack as she hung on for her life . When she felt their reply , she told them what she had learned . They agreed to meet her at the barrier . No fighting , she ordered dogs and pack . We do n't have time , and the stakes are too high . She felt some wolves ignore her , and some dogs . I mean it ! she cried . I 'll make you obey if I have to ! We will not fight , she heard Brokefang say , iron strength in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reluctantly . Any dog who wishes to fight may fight me , right now . Daine relaxed . Let the dogs and the wolves concentrate on the real enemy : those who planned to dump bloodrain in the Dunlath River in two days ' time . In the pass , Daine halted Rebel under some trees and dismounted . Briskly she rubbed him down . " You need to rest . You 'll find grazing over there . And do n't mind all the weird folk who are coming here . Nobody will hurt you . " He lipped her shirt and wandered off to graze , as Daine walked to the barrier . Shapes that looked like rocks on the slope under the threequarter moon rose to their feet and came down to her : the Long Lake Pick . Daine knelt so her eyes would be on a level with theirs . Adults and pups alike , they surrounded her in the greeting ceremony , licking her face and wagging their tails . Brokefang let the girl hug him fiercely about the neck and nuzzled her in reply . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop it , she told him . By ourselves if we must , but I do n't think it will come to that . We have friends now . Two-leggers ? That was Longwind , the conservative . They never cared before . They were not friends before , Daine replied firmly . They are friends now  --  strong friends . They can go places and do things we ca n't , hunt brother . The dogs are almost wolves , offered Fleetfoot . If we sing , they listen . They have their own songs .  | Two-leggers ? Wolf killers ? Longwind sneezed . I am too old for such changes . Brokefang turned on his uncle , teeth bared . You are not too old for changes until I say you are , he snarled , advancing . You will change for now because the pack needs you to change . When it is done , we will return to the old ways . 1 f we can . The comment , unusually quiet and thoughtful , came from Frostfur . I like changes ! The thin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , added Silly . We see new things and do new things . " I hear them , " whispered Daine . " I can hear the pups . It 's because of Scrap , maybe . She was a young cat at the castle , " she explained . " I was with her when I heard of the bloodrain . " Would we like her ? asked Berry . What is a cat ? Thinking of the castle reminded Daine that she had a letter to write . She left the explanation of cats to Fleetfoot and Russet , who had met them in their journey to fetch her . Taking her pack , she entered the stone lean-to where she had hidden to write once before . With the help of her glowstone and cat eyes that had not changed during her ride , she put down all she had heard . Once the facts were laid out , she added : We must do something . I wo n't let them put bloodrain in the river . I hope you know a smart way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of a stupid way to do it . I was wrong to call Stormwings monsters . The creature that could brew and use this bloodrain is the real monster . Gently she blew on the wet writing to dry it , then put her tools away .  | In the distance she felt the approach of Tkaa , Flicker , Kitten , and lakoju , which meant that Tait , Maura , and the dogs had come as well . Tkaa immediately took the letter through the barrier , and lakoju went with him . Flicker muttered a greeting and crawled into Daine 's pack to finish his night 's sleep . " It 's true , what the basilisk said ? " Tait asked , sitting next to Daine . " They 've cooked up some infernal broth ? " " Gissa had a drop of it on her hand when she cut it off , " Daine replied grimly , tickling Kitten 's belly . The dragon , sensing her agitation , voiced a soft run of clicks and chirrups that had always comforted Daine in the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll be all right , Kit , " she whispered . Tait watched Maura as the girl , yawning , bedded down in the shelter of the rocks . " How can ye speak with Tkaa and not lakoju ? She told us she couldna hear ye , and that 's fair strange . " Daine shook her head . " No , it 's not . I ca n't mind-speak with immortals that have some two-legger in them . Only the ones who 're made entirely like animals . "  | The dogs came to lie down with Tait even as the pups , Russet , and Fleetfoot arranged themselves around Maura . For a moment both groups , separated by only a few feet of ground , stared at one another . Then Prettyfoot yawned , and Silly yawned in reply . Daine felt something relax in both clusters of shaggy bodies , and gave an inner sigh of relief . " I 'd like t ' ask a favor , " Tait said , his voice soft . " If aught 's to happen in the castle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the servants out . He 'll make sure none of the nobles or their guests are the wiser . " " You do n't think someone might warn Tristan or Yolane ? " she asked , examining the silver claw at her throat . The hunter shook his head . " Nay . We accepted milady ? she 's Dunlath blood , and Mithros knows ye ca n't pick your lords  --  but none will back her in treason . And the outlanders she foisted on us treat us like slaves . " Daine heard a soft whistle from the barrier : it was Tkaa , half in and half out . Getting up , she ran to him , with Tait close behind . " You may breathe easier , " Tkaa informed them quietly . " The Stormwings and hurroks are at the soldiers ' camp , harrying those who would sleep . The Lioness says they spend as much time battling one another as they do the mortals . " " How can ye know what goes on more'n a day 's ride from here ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . Tkaa nodded . To the man she explained , " It helps mages to speak to other mages , no matter how far off they are . They know about the bloodrain and the mercenaries coming ? " " Yes , " the basilisk replied . " Once all may speak without interruption , Master Numair wishes you to cross the barrier . Perhaps the marmot who helped you there before will serve ? " Daine checked the eastern horizon . " She wo n't be up until dawn . " " It may take that long for the harriers to break off their attack . I will return when all is secure . " Tkaa went back to Numair . They trudged up to the stone cluster , Daine yawning until her jaw ached . " Sleep , " Tait ordered . " I 'll wake ye when Tkaa says they 're ready t ' talk . "  | " We need a plan , " Daine mumbled . " And we do n't have much time . " " Sleep , " Tait repeated . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had arrived when Tkaa summoned Daine at sunrise . The girl watched her pony join Rebel , then sat back to listen for Quickmunch . The marmot was glad to hear from her , and eager to serve Daine again in communicating with her friends . As they made their way from Quickmunch 's burrow to Numair 's camp , Daine felt a crackling tension in the pass . Numair was the source . She never had seen a look on his face like the one that was there now . He radiated fury . Iakoju watched his every movement , dark green eyes wary . Tkaa , as impossible to read as ever , munched quietly on a small pile of rocks . When he saw Daine , Numair spoke a word . The air near him developed a sparkling blotch the size of a floor-length mirror , then opened to frame two figures Daine knew well . The smaller was a redheaded warrior in chain mail , breeches , and boots  --  Alanna the Lioness , the King 's Champion . She was cleaning a sword . The other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much wider . Raoul of Goldenlake , Knight Commander of the King 's Own , wore plate armor over a sweat-soaked , quilted tunic . Sipping from a mug , he saw the image of Numair and his cohorts before his companion . " Alanna , " he said , and pointed . The woman looked up , her famous violet eyes grim . " I hope you have a plan ? I do n't . We could retreat , but that leaves Dunlath secure and you in a bad position . Numair , you told the king Daine 's news ? " " Yes , but you know the problem as well as I. It will be days before more help can reach us . " " And maybe Tristan still put bloodrain in river , " Iakoju pointed out . Sir Raoul made a face . " It goes with what we know of the man . " Alanna 's eyes narrowed . " Daine , is that really you inside this animal ? " Quickmunch nodded , but she said to Daine , I 'm a marmot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mental shrug . She made a note to tell her friend Alanna that marmots were touchy , prideful creatures . Numair sighed . " I 'm afraid we must implement the plan we discussed earlier . " The other two humans nodded . " I do not like it , " remarked Tkaa . " Is there no other way ? " Alanna shook her head . Daine chattered with annoyance . Was somebody going to tell her anything ? An unhappy look in Numair 's eyes silenced her . " Daine , there is one other way to break the barrier . " " It means a lot of risk . " Manna put her sword down . " And it wo n't work unless your friends can draw the mages out of the castle . " Daine looked at Numair , thinking , So what do I do ? He was in a brown study , pressing his nose and staring into the distance . She was about to ask Quickmunch to get his attention when she thought , Can Tkaa hear me ? He hears mortal animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her magic , she called , Tkaa ! The basilisk peered at her . " You can speak to me through this creature ? " The " creature " barked . Daine said , She 's a marmot . Her name is Quickmunch . Tkaa bowed . " Forgive me , Quickmunch . I spoke from ignorance , not contempt . " Numair , Alanna , and Raoul were looking from the marmot to Tkaa . " Daine can speak to you even when she is n't doing it from her own body ? " asked Numair . Tkaa listened to Daine and said , " She has learned she has that ability only now . She asks me to say if you do not tell her what she can do once the mages have left the castle , she will ask Quickmunch to bite you . " Raoul snorted ; the Lioness covered a smile . Numair sighed . " Patience is a virtue you should cultivate . Daine , not you ? Quickmunch , is it ? " The marmot squeaked her reply . " Of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told you of image magic ? "  | Yes , Daine told the basilisk , who translated for her . If you do something magical to an image of a person , it 's the same as doing it to the person . " That is true not only of people , " Numair said . " As it is impossible for Tristan and the others to walk around the valley to create the barrier , they must have enclosed a model of the valley itself . You must find that image in the castle . Once you have broken the circle of magic around it , the barrier will evaporate , and we can enter the valley . " " Opals , " the champion put in . Numair cracked his knuckles . " Alanna and I have assaulted the barrier . It continues to absorb , not reflect , our Gifts . This shows power stones are being used to take magic and feed it into the working . Those stones will be embedded in the model of Dunlath Valley . You 'll have to break them to break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand . Now what about the diversion ? Tkaa repeated the question . The Knight Commander leaned forward . " We think Tristan will send the other mages to deal with a disturbance at the forts , especially if the trouble is odd in any way . If it 's serious , he 'll probably go himself . Numair says Tristan never thinks underlings can handle real trouble without him . If both forts are attacked , there 's a good chance the castle will be left unguarded . " " That ties up the Stormwings , maybe even the hurroks , " Alanna said . " They 're the quickest transport for the mages . Iakoju thinks she can raise her people ? " Iakoju nodded . " If I say so , my kin will fight human masters . We make plenty of ruckus in north . " " I can cause trouble in the south , " added Tkaa . " But I will need help . " He cocked his head to one side . " I am too big a target even for humans to miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Tkaa , will you and Iakoju cross back to talk to everyone with me ? Let 's see what we can come up with . And tell them that Tait thinks he can get all the local people out of the castle . " One thing , " Numair said after Tkaa was done translating . " Time is vital . To be at the southern barrier by sunset tomorrow , Tristan must leave the castle no later than noon , and there  | is a chance he will leave earlier . Whatever you do , it must be ready to go by tomorrow morning . " Wait a moment ! Daine cried , alarmed . What about the mercenaries who are supposed to come  --  that Captain Blackthorn and his men ? When Tkaa passed this on , Sir Raoul grinned . " We have two Rider groups here  --  sixteen irregulars and their ponies ? plus a company of the Own , a hundred warriors . Yes , Blackthorn has a hundred more men than I do , but if we 're in I ) unlath when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blackthorn also hates to fight mages even more than he hates to work with them . If he even heard that Alanna and Numair are waiting , I think he 'll run like a rabbit . " " If that 's all the questions , would you get moving ? " Numair hinted with awful patience . " It 's going to be a long day . " Tristan 's crew are n't the only ones who need to fly , Daine thought , resuming her human shape . I will , too . The animals in the forts should be warned , so they can escape somehow . And I can ask local animals to do some damage , like the pack 's raids on the lumber camp . I hate to endanger them , but this is too important not to involve them . When Daine , Tkaa , and Iakoju explained the attack plan , their friends in the valley had plenty of ideas . The wolves chose to visit the northern fort , to support the ogres and to attack the hated mines . Maura offered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and promised to leave the gate alone so the horses could run . Tait wanted to go with her , and the dogs followed him . Rebel , who itched to help , agreed to carry the man and girl south . Kitten whistled a query . Daine smiled . " You 're with me , Kit . I need you for locked doors . " The dragon chuckled and sharpened her claws on a rock . Flicker said that he would go with Maura and Tait to the southern fort . He also advised Daine to recruit the valley 's squirrels . They could free the fort horses . They also could chew ropes , bowstrings , and the like , once the sun was up . " You think squirrels will want to get involved that much ? " the girl asked . Yes , replied Flicker . The walls in the forts are made of logs ,  | are n't they ? Plenty of my kindred lost homes and lives when those places were built . And the southerners have family by the river where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them . What about the castle servants ? " Daine asked Tait . " I 'll give ye a note t ' my brother Parlan , " the huntsman replied . " He 's the innkeeper . He 'll see it 's done , and done quiet . " " If we fight at dawn , I must go , " Iakoju commented . " I have to talk to ogres , give them hope for freedom . Talk might run all night . " " Let 's take a bit more time , " advised Tait . " Gie the squirrels a while with the sun to work in . If the mage hits the barricade hard , we 'll all hear it . The ninth hour , say ? Then Maura can start burnin ' , and the ogres can rise . " lakoju frowned . " Big noise ? Like being inside a bell ? " " It is very hard to ignore , " Tkaa remarked dryly . " Ogres hear . Ogres hear good , four-five days ago . That 's good signal . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While he was gone , Tait wrote his brother . When he was through , Daine summoned a crow and asked if she would carry the note to the inn . The crow , intrigued , accepted it and took flight . Tkaa returned . " The ninth hour , three hours past dawn , " he told them . " Does everybody know what to do ? " asked Maura , hands on hips . The dogs and wolves yapped ; Flicker squeaked . The humans , Kitten , the ogre , and the basilisk nodded . Rebel and Cloud stamped . " I 'm off to the northern squirrels , then , " Daine said . " And everybody ? " They all looked at her . " Be careful , " she cautioned , eyes stinging a little . " Goddess bless us all . " " Goddess bless , " whispered Maura and Tait . Silently the animals called on their gods , and perhaps the immortals did the same . When the others had gone , Daine turned to Cloud . " If I tie myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pack , can  | you carry us to the place we were last night ? I do n't want to linger here while I talk with the creatures in the north and south if I can help it . " She studied her friend : Cloud looked fresh . " If you ca n't , say so . I 'll call another horse from the village , if ' I must . " And risk thief catchers coming after you ? retorted the pony . I think not . I can do this . You forget , I took my time walking here , and I 've had plenty of rest and water and grazing . How will you be traveling ? " I thought to try that eagle again . " So much the better . You wo n't weigh as much as you do now . I noticed the first thing that seems to change is your bones . If you have bird bones , you 'll hardly weigh anything , just like her . Cloud nodded to Kitten , who was tucking herself into Daine 's pack . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 'll be too much , me and Kit and a crossbow ? " Do n't be a fool , retorted the mare . You need a weapon . The girl sighed and got the rope . " This is going to be fun . " With the help of some birds and a marmot colony from inside the barrier , Daine tied herself , her crossbow , and Kitten to Cloud 's back , with the knots in easy reach . When everything was secure , the pony set off at a walk . As Kitten chirped soothingly , Daine relaxed and listened for I Iuntsong , the golden eagle who had taken her so far the day before . She found him nearly a mile away , about to leave his treetop nest . When she explained what she needed , he agreed to help . Quickly she slid into his mind , and they were off . Word of Flicker 's adventures had gone from tree to tree in the days since the making of the Coldfang statue . The eagle too had been gossiping with other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information . Daine was startled to find that the woods and rocky slopes all along the western side of the Long Lake buzzed , not only with her name , but with the names of her companions  --  humans , immortals , and animals . When she called from Huntsong 's mind to the squirrels near the north fort , they asked what they could do to help end the destruction . Wood rats , overhearing what she told the squirrels , wanted jobs of their own . Three flocks of starlings reminded her that  | they had come at her call before , to drive off Stormwings . Did she have more fun for them ? With the wild beasts clamoring for Daine 's attention , the domestic animals who lived in the fort were eager to listen to her . The dogs and cats left right away , not waiting for the next sunrise . The horses agreed to flee to the docks , once Daine promised that the wolves and other hunters would leave them alone . As Huntsong wheeled south , Daine saw the pack running single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the miles between them and the fort . lakoju , heavy legs pumping in an equally constant tempo , brought up the rear . When the eagle dropped down to eye level , the ogre realized who it must be and waved , grinning cheerfully . On their way to the southern fort , they found a trio of Stormwings going from there to the castle . With a shiver , Daine saw Rikash was one of ' them . Have they ever bothered you ? she asked Huntsong . The great bird glared at the approaching immortals . Not in a general way , he replied , talons clenching . We had a few misunderstandings when they first came here , until they learned the error of their ways . His wrath faded , and he added , All the same , I shall give them a wide berth . They cut my mate to ribbons when she defended our nest . He drifted to one side . Two Stormwings flapped past , making rude noises . Only Rikash changed course , to fly around Huntsong in a wide circle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ K'miri male , came back and joined him . " They soar , do n't they ? " Rikash asked them . " Wheeling , wheeling , always in the same place ? " " Like toy kites , and twice as wood-skulled , " joked the K'mir . " But now here is this one , flying in a straight line , going somewhere . You do n't see prey when you go too fast , am I right ? " Get ready to drop , Daine warned Huntsong . Rikash spat , not looking to see if anyone was below . " This valley has a disease , one where cute little animals do n't act like animals . Did I tell you about the squirrel ? "  | " Only a million times , " said the K'miri Stormwing with a groan . Daine saw muscles bunch in Rikash 's neck . Drop ! she cried . Huntsong threw up his wings and dropped , hurtling earthward at terrifying speed . " Go , go , go ! " screamed Rikash . The female whooped , and steel-winged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , urging him into the trees that covered the road south . The eagle shot into the clear space between road and branches , scudding down the corridor they made . There was a scream and a crash : a Stormwing had come to grief . Huntsong risked a glance back . The female , scratched and bleeding , was trying to free herself from a chestnut . Seconds later the K'mir came in view , fighting to pull out of his stoop before he slammed into the dirt . He failed . Relieved , Huntsong looked forward . Rikash awaited them ahead , where the trees fell briefly away from the road . Land , Daine urged . I look stupid when I walk , complained the eagle as he obeyed . Hopping like a sparrow is not eagle 's work . If you think you look stupid , imagine how he will look , I ) aine consoled him . Rikash cursed and darted forward , flying low , trying to keep his great metal wings From clipping the earth or trees . Called from their nests , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rikash screeched , tried to cover his eyes with his wings , and slammed into an elm . Now run , Daine told the squirrels ; they obeyed . Huntsong liked that advice , too . He took off , flapping lazily past the spot where Rikash fought the elm 's entangling branches . The air filled with the Stormwing 's curses as Huntsong broke free of the trees . With battle already joined , Daine had no trouble persuading the southern animals to do what they could to help Tkaa , Maura , Tait , and Flicker . The fort 's animals , told what was going on , were as eager to stop the use of the bloodrain as Daine was . I think we 're done , the girl told Huntsong , feeling more tired than ever . Let 's go home . I 'd return by myself , but I 'm  | prob'ly outside the range of my magic , and I do n't know if I would make it . Would you mind terribly if I left you inside your range , and went back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help there . It would be a pleasure . Daine smiled and replied , Of course . Flying low over the treetops , keeping away from the road , they passed Tait , Maura , Tkaa , and the others . Daine pointed out the basilisk . Talk to him , she told Huntsong as they continued to head north . He can translate for the two-leggers , and they should know of something you can do . The moment she felt the tug of attraction that was her true body , she wished the eagle good luck and separated from him . Instantly he turned south again as she slid into her human self . With regret she changed his farsighted eyes to her own , limited orbs , and his hollow , light bones into a human 's heavier ones . Talons became feet ; wings became arms . When she opened her eyes , all that remained was a layer of down between her clothes and skin . " I 'm back , " she muttered . " Huzzah . " Cloud halted . That crow came by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she dropped the note into the man 's lap . He read it , and the last she saw of him , he was on his way to the castle . Daine took a deep breath . " I hope he 's as trustworthy as Tait says . " The girl extracted herself and Kitten from the ropes that kept them on the pony 's back . Then , with Daine afoot and Kitten walking or riding , they took the remainder of the day to approach the village , staying clear of outlying farms . They stopped as the shadows lengthened , so Daine could catch and cook some fish and Cloud would have a chance to graze ; it was near dark when they moved on . Everywhere the People were talking . Dunlath 's nonhuman residents had much to say about recent events . They spoke to kinfolk , distant relatives , even enemies ( at a safe distance ) . Their opinions and questions were so loud that Daine wondered if the two-leggers did n't guess something was up . If they did , she saw no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees at the spot where she had left her bedroll and saddle , she watched the local people go about their end-of-day chores ,  | then vanish into their homes . Lamps flared briefly in most houses , then went out : farmers rose and went to bed with the sun . Only the inn and the castle windows stayed lit for any time after dark . Over the night the Song Hollow bats checked in , waking her with news of her friends . Iakoju had made it safely to the ogre dwellings around nightfall , starting a great deal of movement between buildings and a constant hum of ogre voices . The Long Lake Pack busied itself among the mine wagons , working pins that held wheels to axles out of their settings with their teeth , and chewing the reins until only scraps held them together . In the south , wood rats laid dry twigs and grasses at the base of the wall and around all structures but the gate and the stables . Dogs howled incessantly outside , as little fires erupted in the commander 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men up all night . At last , with only a few hours left until dawn , the activity ended . The People , and Daine , used the time in unbroken sleep . She awoke at dawn , aching from tense muscles . In contrast to the racket of the day before , the animals were quiet . Even the birds who greeted the sun were silent , awaiting events . From the trees Daine watched as castle servants crossed the bridge in pairs , small groups , or alone , to enter the village . Parlan waited on the other side of the causeway , steering them to the inn . There were no soldiers to worry about ; Yolane relied on Tristan and the forts for protection . Daine called to the castle mice as the sky brightened . Soon they reported back to her : only the nobles and Tristan remained there . The sun rose . In the north and in the south , squirrels were working hard to free the fort horses and do as much damage as possible . The soldiers were finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheese were inedible . The ogres were collecting weapons and moving their children to safety . Daine combed her hair and tied it back , then removed her clothes and shook them out before putting them back on . She ate cheese and stolen apples , groomed Cloud , and fed Kitten what remained of their previous night 's fish . Last of all , she saddled the mare and tucked Kitten into her carry-sack . Give them time , Tait had said , but she had n't known the  | hours needed by her allies would strain her nerves so cruelly . Her tension was made worse by the fact that she heard little movement in the village . The cows had been milked before sunrise , livestock had been fed , but apart from that , the local twoleggers kept out of sight . It made her feel as if she had a ghost town at her back . At last , she heard a sound like a huge bell hit from the inside , as loud here as it had been in the caves . It was followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Billows of smoke appeared on the lake 's southern shore . She would have to ask Maura what on earth her friend had managed to blow up . Silver caught her eye from that direction : Stormwings , flying hard and homing in on the castle . She noticed they were as soot-blackened as chimney sweeps as they vanished inside the curtain wall . She felt the hurrok trio come from the north . One bore a scroll in its left forepaw , and the gems in all their collars burned a bright yellow . They were in pain , clawing at the bands around their necks . Screaming in rage , the hurroks darted into the circle of the castle 's wall . Checking the northern sky , she saw faint columns of smoke . Something was afire , but she could n't tell what it was . She waited briefly , and the fliers reappeared . This time the hurroks had riders who controlled them with reins and bit . They fought these as they had the collars , with no success . Two flew north . Daine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to an eagle 's vision . The mages on the hurrok pair were Redfern and Gissa . One hurrok tried to turn back , but Gissa was having none of it . Her mouth moved . A cloud of orange fire appeared on the immortal 's rump . From the way he leaped forward , the fire must have hurt . She turned to check the others . The Stormwings bore two humans in rope slings . Tristan rode the hurrok : he too used fire to sting his mount forward . Daine made her eyes human again , then mounted Cloud . " Now , " she told her companions . The pony raced for the causeway . All down its length , past the dock where the nobles kept a few boats and through the gate , Daine cringed , feeling exposed . Only when they were in the courtyard did she dare to sit up .  | There were no watchers on the castle walls , and the courtyard was empty . Do n't bother unsaddling me , Cloud told her when she dismounted . Find what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stables . " And rob every feed bag you see , right ? " Daine whispered as she freed Kitten from her pack and put her down on the flagstones . Hanging the crossbow on her belt and the quiver over her shoulder , she trotted into the castle , the young dragon close behind . Blueness and Scrap met her in the great hall . They looked smaller this way , though Daine could see that Blueness wad a creature of noble bulk , for a cat . Scrap was a dainty thing , and fascinated by Kitten . Have you seen anything like this ? Daine asked the cats , picturing what she thought the model would look like . No , said Blueness . Scrap ! he said imperiously when the youngster , sniffing Kitten 's muzzle , did n't reply . Answer the question ! The young cat sneezed . No , she replied . But I have not seen all there is to see . We are not allowed in the mages ' workrooms . Show me where those workrooms are , Daine said . Quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad flight of stairs to a gallery on the second floor , and down a hallway . Kitten made as little noise as they did : her talons , which Daine thought might click like a dog 's , only made tiny scratching sounds . The new humans sleep here , Blueness said , stopping at the end of a long corridor . In those two sets of rooms , and those two . Daine tried one door : it was locked . " Kit , remember how you popped the lock at the inn ? " The dragon nodded . " Give t his a whirl , will you ? " The dragon sat up on her hindquarters and eyed the lock with interest . She gave a soft trill , as she had at the inn . The lock shone gold for a moment , then went dull . Kitten made a clucking sound and trilled again , breaking the sound into a high note and a low one . The door swung open . Can she teach me to do that ? asked Scrap as they entered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Rubin , " I said . " What a miracle . This guy looks almost apelike . A little more pancake across the brow and you could bring him right into the Neanderthal Era . " The face above the towel grinned . " I wondered when you 'd get around to me , Abby . " He studied my face in return , wriggling a little under Rubin 's ministrations . " I see you 're already in makeup . " " The director does n't wear makeup , you horse ball . " " Oh . I 'm sorry . That 's your regular skin ? " He stuck his hand under Rubin 's arm and we shook . " Good to see you , Abby . " He rolled his eyes in the direction of the Green Room door . " That repellent medicine man seems very taken with Ike . I got the feeling he thinks she might be as much fun to drive as a stock car . " His eyebrows wagged . " Probably thinks the world of his stick shift . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Sorry . I did n't mean to gossip in front of you . " She flashed him a smile , a smile so perfect that , had she used it , she would have won that tax case in the Supreme Court . " Please , " she said , " do n't mind me . Gossip 's my middle name . " " I thought your middle name was Razzmatazz , " I said . " I use several middle-aliases . For now , just call me Hilda-theMouth Murray . In fact , I was just waiting for the doctors to leave so I could get in a little slander . But I was thinking more of the female barracuda in the rose silk underwear . " She made a face at Tony . " Did you catch it earlier when I asked that woman if she had any advice about glassblower 's hands " ? here Hilda held out her red mitts ? " and she told me to call her office to make an appointment ? I suppose she thought my middle name was discount medi-cine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " you have to expect doctors to get all twisted about stuff like that . It 's in the Hippocratic Manual that they do n't give away advice for free . But where does it say they have to ogle gorgeous broadcast producers ? " " He 's a guy , not just a doctor , " Hilda said . " The Guy Manual was printed ages before Hippocrates wrote an admiring treatise on his first hiccup . But that female knew I was only gabbing . She still behaved as if I were trying to rip off her medical training . If she 'd asked me about glass , I 'd have been happy to give her all the hot info , and I do mean hot . Free . " Hilda smiled that Supreme Court smile again . " I love talking about glass , which is why I jumped at  | the chance to do this show . My department chair was going to do it himself , but I actually blow more balls than he does , so I got the job . " " Balls ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sound better ? " " Lots better , " I said . " We do n't use the word balls ' on network TV . Your pretty bubbles will probably be the best part of today 's Morning Watch . The only competition you have is this bore from NASA , the government agency we all love to hate . " " Wrong , Abagnarro , " Tony said . " America hates to love us . In their secret hearts , everybody adores space exploration ; but nobody likes to pay for the real thing . Most Americans figure they can get to space by paying seven-fifty at the box office and taking their popcorn to their seats . Painless , you know ? " " Not always , " Hilda said . " Did you see Star Trek : The Final Frontier ? " " Ouch , " Tony said , probably from memories of the film rather than from anything Rubin was doing to his face . Rubin stepped back and ran his eye over Tony 's round face and red hair , then lifted the towel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hamper under the table . " You 're all done , Tony . Nobody 'll know you from Adam . I got ta say Abby 's right : I am a miracle worker . You came in ugly and you 'll go out present-able . " " I love doing this show . It keeps me humble , " Tony said , standing and stretching , showing off a beige suit that had probably cost about a fourth of what either of the Doctors Stefanopolis had spent on his TV attire . " Abagnarro , on the other hand , does n't need any humility lessons . He 's got doctors slobbering over Ike right under his nose and he ca n't do a thing about it . " I held up a hand . " Do n't be so sure , Space Boy . I can make Aristotle look like a toad on national TV  --  which there wo n't be any of if I do n't split soon . " I spotted a copy of Running Out of Time that had been left on the makeup table beside Tony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the photo on the back of the jacket . There was the smiling trio of two Stefanopolises and one Quintinale . " What 's the deal on the orgy of bad humor I interrupted in here ? Did somebody say the wrong thing ? I got the impression you all rolled out of bed on the wrong side  --  I assume not the same bed , however . "  | Tony propped his hip against the makeup table and frowned . " For one thing , " he said , " Ike should never have scheduled a NASA Jetson like me on the same program with Aristotle Stefanopolis . He 's the turncoat who testified to Congress during our budget hearings a couple of years and a few billion dollars ago . The House Committee on Science , Space , and Technology lapped it up . " " Tony , everybody testified against NASA 's budget two years ago . I think even E.T . stood up to be counted . " " Yeah . But . Aristotle was the only one on the NASA payroll who spooked on us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Consultant . " I whistled . " Still , you 're both civilized . Or , at least you are . Was there something else I missed ? " Tony shrugged , but Rubin 's the hottest lip at the network , and he said , " It ai n't in the press kit from the publisher , but Olivia Quintinale used to be married to the dumpy brother with the glasses . " " So ? " I said . " They must get along pretty well to produce a book together . Divorce does n't mean you ca n't work as a team . You just do n't screw anymore . Look at Ike and me . " Rubin 's fat face wrinkled into a cherubic smirk . " You would n't sound so philosophical , Abby , if Ike Tygart had taken up with your brother . " " Aristotle and Olivia ? His own brother 's wife ? Aristotle was doing Hektor 's wife ? Before or after the divorce ? " " I 'm not sure , " Rubin said . " My information 's from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Rubin took a clean towel from the stack on the table and wiped his hands . " From the way Aristotle was looking at Ike , I 'd say he gets ideas pretty quickly . Probably did n't wait for the divorce . " The last thing I wanted to discuss with Rubin Gorman was any idea concerning Ike . Like I said , he 's got the broadcast lip . I touched the sleeve of Hilda 's jacket . " Let 's get out of here . Even a gossip like you must 've had your fill , and I promised you a tour of the control room . You can watch me work , which is better than a cold tour . "  | Tony immediately objected . " What about me ? How come you get all the pretty women ? " I produced my best leer . " What can I tell you , Tony ? Some people got it and make it pay ; some people ca n't even give it away . " " Last I heard , Abby , you could n't even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Life-Form . We 've had enough NASA cracks out of you . Besides , you 've been listening to radio signals from the wrong planet . You just sit back down and think about outer space until somebody remembers you 're in here . If you 're not called by Thursday , try Good Morning , America . " Hilda and I made a quick exit . It was n't the gossip about the doctors ' past that had lit a fire under me . It was speculation about the future . I was bent on keeping track of the promising new flirtation apparently under way between Ike Tygart and Aristotle Stefanopolis , Race Car Doctor and Domestic Raider . We hung a right down the corridor where most of the editing rooms are located . The flickering screens inside the darkened rooms cast some nice special-effects lighting onto the green linoleum floor where we were walking . At the end of the hall , I opened the door into Control Room #1 and saw that most of the wall of monitors was dark . Only the line monitor , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the network , was on , and I could see that Early Watch was doing the East Coast weather story . A quick glance at the picture showed me that it had n't started snowing since I left the street . Ike was at her station , which is perched back and about three feet up from the well of electronic boards , consoles , switchers , computers , phones , headsets , and monitor screens where we turn videotape and live human activity into television . Control Room #1 is the network 's most costly single workspace . It 's twenty-three feet long , ten feet deep , and looks like the cockpit of the new-model intergalactic starship that Captain Picard would like to have when he gets promoted off that scow the U.S.S. Enterprise and gets a real command . Everyone who works in the control room faces the long wall banked with monitors  --  until you get used to it , it can be difficult to concentrate with sixty-six screens , sometimes with that many different pictures , in front of you .  | Ike 's probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ premier position in the center of the video fireworks , right in front of the line monitor . That 's our stethoscope on the heart of the network , the monitor that will tell us we 're all fired if we ever go off the air by accident , leaving the affiliates with black screens . Of course , we would also all be fired if we put something out over the air worse than blackness , something that is n't the perfectly acceptable little war or disaster footage full of bloodied and shredded dead bodies that we thought was in the video output  --  but rather something really nasty like live naked human bodies having a good time . Ike was wearing her headset , and her fingers were blurring over the keyboard of her computer . She makes a lot more noise than most keyboardists because she types too hard . She did n't even glance up as we stepped past her and down into the well of the control room . I swiveled an empty chair for Hilda and took the direc-tor 's chair . I said good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sits to my right . I checked the line clock against my watch , and asked for a camera check . Ginger started flipping keys on her console , and three monitors on the lowest tier lit up one by one . Crystal clear in their designer clothing and looking as pricey as the hookers I 'd seen across from Lincoln Center , the doctors sprang into being on the three monitors , in three different camera angles . They were ensconced on the peach brocade couches of our living room set , getting miked by the floor crew . J.D. Waters was being civil to them and arranging his notes on his lap . That set is only one of the four independent venues we use on Morning Watch . The different sets are spread out at intervals across the vast spaces of Studio 57 and divided from each other by cycs ( shortspeak for cycloramas ) and various sound breaks : sometimes a curtain , sometimes a Plexiglas wall , sometimes just an air pocket , depending on what we 're doing on a given set . Studio 57 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big enough to host a papal mass , but the Mormon Tabernacle Choir could hold its annual family picnic there with room left over for the New York Islanders to run potato sack races . I picked up the script from my console and fanned through its pages quickly , with an eye to reminding myself about what was being done where in the studio for this show . I looked up and ran  | my eyes over the studio monitors . I knew the glassblowing equipment was set up in the kitchen on our fake breakfast counter , but I had that from the script and from memory , not from the monitors . We only have four studio cameras and no robot technology in Studio 57 . A two-hour news-talk show is far too complicated for robocams , because we move among our four sets frequently . So , if I wanted to check out the studio without actually going there , I 'd have to deal with real people who earn salaries . The camera operators had already set themselves and the big l Iitachi cameras . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ J.D. was schmoozing the doctors . Sitting in the control room is even trickier to the mind than sitting in front of your tube at home and sorting out the question of reality . Studio 57 is halfway across the building from Control Room #1 , but when we see the people and the sets on the monitors , it 's always tempting to think they 're on the other side of the wall , like we could reach through the screens and touch the anchor . I punched the key for the head cameraman 's earphones  --  those big ungainly things that we call " cans " ? hoping he had them on his head and not on some prop table . " Wally , if you 're on cans , can you turn on camera four and give me a studio sweep ? " A monitor just at my eye level sprang to life , showing Hannah sitting in her anchor chair on the news set , with a copy of TV Guide in one hand and her telex in the other . She hooked the coil of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the piece into her left ear , the whole operation one-handed . Years of practice paying off . Then she took the whole apparatus off and put it back on the desk . Must be a new jacket , I thought , and she was making sure the telex was a good fit . Since she could n't smoke in there , I knew it could n't be TV Guide that had interrupted her drug pipeline to her lungs . The camera view swung around , and I saw that the den set was empty of people but ready for Tony Jones and his million-dollar golf ball space doodad , and , as the view swept through another sixty degrees or so , I saw the glassblowing setup in the kitchen . At my left , Hilda smiled when she saw her gear .  | At the end of the camera 's swing , I saw the doctors sitting in the living room with J.D. " J.D. , " I said to the intercom mike on my console , " are you ready ? Wan na do your Princess Margaret impression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grinned . " I forgot to bring my mane and tail , Abby . Terribly sorry , but some other time , per-haps ? " " You got it , J.D. Ready ? " " Quite ready . " " Then let 's roll tape . " I counted into the intercom . " Four , three , two , one  --  cue J.D. " On my signal , we were making television . Right away I could see that Hektor Stefanopolis was up to his trick of turning around to look at things . Time to talk like the intercom god . " Cut , " I said . J.D. looked up and waited . The doctors glanced around , trying to locate my voice . I opened the private line to Wally 's cans . " The doctor wearing glasses . I want camera two to roll with his face when he 's talking so we keep him full in the eye . Okay ? And keep a tight grip on the focus handle  --  we 've got a live one . " I leaned over the intercom microphone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , three , two , one  --  cue J.D. " Behind me , Ike 's keyboard noise abruptly stopped , her headset was plunked down on her console , and she left the control room . The interview went so smoothly after that first glitch that I knew these doctors had done television before . I listened to the interview , which is how I get away with reading as few books as I do . Five minutes of directing , and I had the gist of Running Out of Time . The authors had taken on the Food and Drug Administration in their book , arguing that experimental drugs should get much quicker approval from the government , especially for patients like those suffering from AIDS and therefore running out of time . Aristotle was a natural on camera , and , with his memorable face , he would probably sell more than a few copies of the book to women . Olivia Quintinale spoke only briefly , but her command of statistics was pretty impressive . Without notes , she reeled off numbers about studies showing that participation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , took the edge off feelings of powerlessness , and dramatically decreased the inci-  | dence of despair . I thought J.D. should have asked Quintinale what the statistics showed about the physical condition of people using risky new drugs , but the network does n't pay me to sit in front of a camera and act like I know anything . But , I thought , Hannah would have asked . The real surprise of the interview , however , was Hektor . The man was a poet . His eloquence on the plight of AIDS patients , his masterful handling of the touchy subject of thalidomide , and his simple denunciation of the FDA 's refusal to approve a painkiller called Coratrol for the long-term treatment of pain  --  all these changed Hektor before my eyes from an awkward and difficult human , much less television , personality , into a fascinating rhetorician with a good story to tell . And Hektor 's soft-spoken tirade against the U.S. Department of Agriculture for what he called " their slow , slow , torturous paperwork rain dance in search of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medicated bait in the wild to halt the recent spread of raccoon-transmitted rabies in the Northeast  --  that showed me that Hektor Stefanopolis had cast his net of accusations among federal departments , without having a favorite target . Hektor was versatile in his wrath . Angry people who can control their vocabularies usually make good TV . Once we had the camera position figured out , he was a pleasure to watch . The subject of stock car racing came up at the end , and Ginger was ready beside me , with the tape of Aristotle 's latest experiment in getting as close to death as he could without actually crossing that line you ca n't ever get back across . I had a feeling that this side of Aristotle would sell books to men . " Dr. Stefanopolis , " J.D. said , in his BBC syllables , " how do you reconcile a dangerous sport like auto racing with your career as a doctor , a doctor who is trying to save lives ? " " I do n't reconcile it , " Aristotle said , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would convince many women in our audience that he wished he was in their homes with them , helping make the coffee or the beds . " I 'm a very good physician . I 'm a very good auto racer . I ca n't reconcile the two , so I just make sure I do n't do them at the same time . " Now the smile was self-mocking . J.D. laughed . " It certainly seems wise to keep the two practices separate . We have footage of your spectacular crash at Long Pond ,  | Pennsylvania , last month . If you do n't mind a replay ? " " I 've replayed it a thousand times in my mind , " Aristotle said . " It has a happy ending , you know . " I cued Ginger , and the videotape played on the studio living room 's huge monitor , as well as on four of our preview monitors in the control room . Aristotle sat forward on the couch to watch , but I could tell he was just working for the cameras @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hektor slewed around to gaze at the screen . Dr. Quintinale looked slightly miffed , like watching car crashes was not what she had come on national television to do with her ex-husband and **29;0;TOOLONG . " Your car flipped over completely an incredible seven times , " J.D. said , as the black and red Chevy Lumina on the tape crashed into a wall of the Pocono Raceway and flipped so fast it was impossible to count how many times . Anyway , not with the tape playing at normal speed . " Can you tell us , Dr. Stefanopolis , what you were thinking when you stepped out of what was left of that car ? " Aristotle sat back against the cushions of the couch . " I remember thinking I 'd never felt so alive . " In my peripheral vision , I could see Hilda 's jaw drop when she heard that . And Ginger snorted . Maybe Aristotle was n't as big a hit with women as I thought . On one of the monitors I could see Ike standing at the edge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind it up . She was evidently satisfied with what they 'd gotten . " We 'll keep the tape rolling in the living room in case Ike wants to retake any of that , " I told Ginger . " But now I want the YellowMan and the Sarajevo pieces in the preview unit , if they 're ready . " " Ready when you are . " Above the studio monitors that still showed the doctors , the bank of preview monitors came up with color bars . Then Ginger started the tapes rolling . The dish had made it into Sarajevo all right , and the crew , under heavy sniper fire , had spooned the pictures out without a wasted frame . You do n't overshoot or get fancy angles in a situation like that . Even so , those pictures off the satellite were so clear and disturbing that I knew Ike would tell Hannah to warn the viewers about the graphic nature of the images . They were gory , but I had no complaints about the quality of the tape .  | On another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ninth victim looked just like the eight men who had come before : a scruffy citizen sprawled on the ground , his face painted yellow . I moved over to get my eyes closer to one of the screens . It was more like the paint was smeared on the man 's face than painted on . Hard to imagine what the killer was trying to accomplish or say . I sat back in my chair and watched the tape thoughtfully . The camera had panned down the length of the body , away from the yellow face , down along the center of the chest where there was a small bloody hole , and had paused at the by-now-familiar crumpled note that was the other signal that this killer was trying to tell us something . On the dirty scrap of paper were the letters " U.S.S.R. " Good camera work , absolutely clear as a new mirror , and , as with each victim before , we 'd all be wondering what this homeless person had to do with Russia . Or whatever part of the former Soviet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Russian killer . Maybe he did n't know the Cold War was over . I glanced over at Hilda and could tell the Yellow-Man picture had upset her , or maybe it had been Sarajevo . Her lips were clamped together , and her hands were tight around the arms of the chair . It was n't like the pictures themselves were something millions of people would n't see in their homes in a short while , but here in the control room , up close and on four screens and preedited and right in your face and lacking a trained narrator 's voice to give them distance and perspective , the pictures were so much more potent than they 'll ever be on your screen at home . Control room reality had struck again . The picture zoomed back slowly . The shot widened . We got the victim at full length , from the angle of his feet , which were covered with crumbling tennis shoes . It was great actuality , but I had to admit this angle was gritty and maybe too much for morning TV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but , after I thought about it , I decided I 'd advise keeping the shot , mainly because of my conversation with Fred Loring . If nobody gave a rat 's ass about the serial killings of homeless men , this shot could maybe provide a little jolt to the public conscience , maybe up the price to a dog 's ass . The ambulance was not in the picture , but its rotating arc of light swept at intervals over the faces of the cops and paramedics and bystanders gathered around the body . There , in the center of the  | group , was Midtown North Homicide Captain Dennis Fillingeri , dressed in a crisp white dress shirt , not a strand of his thick brown hair out of place . Then , in a gesture I 'd seen from him many times before , he ran his fingers through that mop and there still was n't a hair out of place . He sure as hell did n't use anything as un-macho as mousse , so I wondered what his secret was . I was never going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give him a chance to say , " Oh , it just grows that way . Great hair runs in my family . " And then I saw it . Just past all that great hair was a head of greasy gray hair , towering behind Fillingeri , who is himself not a dwarf . I knew that head of greasy hair . And I knew that flash of gold teeth when their owner opened his mouth in a sneer . And I knew the name of the owner of the hair and the teeth : Tex , the Manhattan Mugger . The man who had about four dollars of my money . The man who had said he had a story for me . Since it now seemed likely that his story had something to do with the report that would be leading our first news block , I was wishing I had listened to him . Especially if he was the killer . I sat back and frowned at the screens . Tex did n't look Russian to me . What time did the crew shoot this Yellow-Man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Morning Watch sits a lot closer than I do to the one monitor that shows the time code on unedited videotape . She paused the tape and squinted . " We 're looking at 2:34:04 . " She glanced down at the keys on her console , her hand hovering over color and brightness adjusters . " Why ? Something wrong with it ? " " No . It 's not that . The tape looks fine . " Superb , in fact , if I was in the market for a moving mug shot of the man who had vacuumed my pockets . It was interesting , I  | thought , that Tex had been in Central Park , hanging out at a murder scene , before he had picked me up outside of Lincoln Center . Nice command of the neighborhood , this mugger . I sighed at the screen . It was surely too much to hope that he had also cleaned the pockets of Captain Dennis Fillingeri . I pointed a finger at Fillingeri 's face on the monitor . " Correct me if I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where we 've seen the great captain himself at the scene of the crime ? It 's always been underlings before . " " Yeah . I guess nine is Fillingeri 's magic number . It 's nine bodies now , right ? " I nodded . " Nine . " I pushed my chair back from the console and stretched my legs . Leg room 's always at a premium in the control room . " Nine homeless men . Nine yellow faces . Nine notes from the killer . What the hell do you think that U.S.S.R. stuff is all about ? " " I do n't know . The New Russian Mafia ? " " Who knows ? " " Not me . Maybe it stands for something else , not Russia . " I raised an eyebrow . " Like what ? Urgent Serial Slayer Rampage ? " Now it was her turn to raise an eyebrow . " How long 'd it take you to think of that ? " " I just tossed it off . Directors have to think on their feet . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so I am . Just imagine what I could have come up with if I 'd been standing . " Ginger looked back at the screen . " Well , Fillingeri 's standing . He looks like he could use some help thinking . I do n't think he 's got a due about this Yellow-Man stuff . " " I do , " I said , not happily . " See that big guy behind Fillingeri ? " " Yeah ? " " lie mugged me tonight . " " I heard you got it on the street , " Ginger said , hiding a smile . " What 's so funny ? " I demanded . " I do n't know , " she said , her smile now out in the open . " It 's just funny . The way you think you own the city , skating in and out of traffic , skating backwards , doing flips . It 's like you think you 're invincible . So , you finally found out you 're mortal . That 's funny . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't  | funny . The guy 's a nut . He quoted the Bible to me and said he had a story about killing . " Ginger lost her smile and cast a look full of meaning at the monitor showing the pictures of the Central Park Yellow-Man . " I guess he had a story , all right . All about a guy lying dead with his face painted a horrible yellow . Too bad it 's the same story we 've already seen eight times before . " Some movement from one of the studio monitors caught my eye . I could see Hektor leaning back against the cushions of the couch . His glasses were in his lap , and he had his hands cupped over his right eye . " Check out the doctor , " I said . " What 's he doing ? " Ginger leaned to her left to look , and Hilda leaned toward me , but just as they both leaned , Hektor lowered his hand and we could see him wincing and blinking hard , like he 'd rubbed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out his eyeball , it looks like , " Ginger said . " Jesus , that 's gross . " " I wonder what 's wrong with his eyes . You ever see anyone with that habit he 's got of moving around like he 's sitting on a spindle ? " " No . " Ginger sat back in her chair and put her hands behind her head , cracking her knuckles . " He looks kind of like he 's made out of wood from the neck up , does n't he ? Like one of those oldfashioned dolls . Whatever ails him , he 's got it bad . " I looked at the line clock : 5:24 . I looked at the monitors into Studio 57 : the other two doctors were still jawing with J.D. and Ike . I looked at Hilda : she looked like she could use a walk , and I decided that the best therapy for her , after the nasty Yellow-Man footage , would be some glassblowing . And I needed to talk to Ike about Tex . " Let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I suggested . " Ginger , get those cameras rolled for the kitchen set . " Hilda did n't say anything , but she rose from the chair , gave Ginger a wobbly smile , and headed up the stairs toward the door . Future item to include in my stereotype of glassblowers , I thought : weak stomach . We retraced our steps along the editing corridor , turned right at the Tube , followed it a quarter of the way around its circumference , and stopped under the flashing red light over the door to Studio 57.  | " You okay ? " I asked . " I am now . God , I feel so guilty . I never cared about those awful serial killings until I saw what you had in there , those gruesome shots of that dead man . Even the New York Post has n't had pictures that bad , and you know what they 're like . " " Print pictures have a more subtle kind of impact , you know , where the reader has to do a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's different when the image moves . The picture is the story . That 's why we call it tell-a-vision . ' " I spelled it for her . I patted her shoulder and pushed open the studio door . The Morning Watch kitchen is the first set you encounter in that vast cavern , with the living room and the den off to either side and the news set farthest from the door . Hilda went straight to her gear and pulled a heavy apron off the counter . She was tying it around her neck as the doctors , escorted by Ike , reached the kitchen . " Is that asbestos , that apron ? " Hektor asked , ogling her attire in his odd way . " You should n't be wearing asbestos , you know . It 's carcinogenic . " Hilda shook her head and reached for the waist ties of the apron . " ' Phis is leather , just to keep the gobs and blobs off my clothes . It 's not fire protection . If I could n't control my fire better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for another career . " " Where does a glassblower work , I wonder ? " Aristotle drawled , giving us a lazy version of his wide , off-center smile . " I picture a rustic studio in Sleepy Hollow or Croton-on-Hudson , some place with ivy and a blacksmith , with rolling hills in the background . " " That sounds nice , " Hilda said , reaching for one of the four glass vials she 'd be using . They looked like tiny transparent onions , with perfectly rounded bulbs at the bottom , say an inch and a half in diameter , and long , narrow , hollow stems open at the top and rising about six inches out of the little bulbs . " But I have to make do with a stuffy lab at Columbia University . I work in the Physics Department there . " She got busy arranging the four identical vials in a rack on the counter . " What 's your title ? " Olivia Quintinale asked , suddenly alert , as though the university part had rung a chime in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been calling you Dr. Murray ? "  | " My title 's Glassblower , Dr. Quintinale . Plain and simple . If you ever need any advice about glass , just call the switchboard and ask for a glassblower . They 'll connect you . " " I 'm sorry if I offended you earlier , " Quintinale said . " I 'd be happy to take a look at your hands now . I really just answered you out of nerves , you know . Stage fright . " " Do n't worry about it , " Hilda said , a preoccupied frown on her face as she reached for a beaker filled with clear liquid . " There 's nothing wrong with my hands . " She started pouring the liquid into the first vial , and a sudden pungent aroma filled the air . Hektor leaned over the counter and waved his nose over Hilda 's operations . " Vinegar , " he said . " Yep , " she said . " I 've got four different liquids that we 're going to seal up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea is that , once the vials are sealed , they 're sealed . And I mean sealed . Forever . Or at least a few thousand years . " She lifted one of the stemmed onions and held it up to the glare of the studio lights . " Unless you toss these little glass suckers on the floor or something , they 're as good as sealed for all time  --  that is , if you measure time by any way that makes sense for people . " She lowered the vial slightly and , through it , looked Hektor in the eye . " Not a bad little trick , huh ? Considering that the container " ? here she flicked a red finger against the glass bulb , producing a ping ? " is itself a liquid . " " Glass is a liquid ? " I shook my head in disbelief . " No way . It 's a solid . Just look at it . And listen to it . " We 'd all heard the noise she 'd made when she thumped it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twinkled . " That 's what everybody thinks . However , chemically , glass is a liquid . It shows net movement over time . Did you ever look closely at a stained-glass window that was really old ? " " I guess not . " " Well , next time you get a chance , take a good look . You 'll notice that the bottom of the window is thicker than the top . That 's because the glass is flowing downward . " " I 'll be damned . " " Probably , " Ike murmured at my side . Nobody caught it but me . As long as I had her attention , I decided to take her aside rather  | than hold a whispering contest . I touched her elbow and we stepped back from the counter . " I have to talk to you about the Yellow-Man tape , " I said . " Not now . " " You 'll be sorry . My mugger 's on that tape . " " What ? " " You heard me . " " Jesus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean he 's standing there in the park  --  bystanding , I should say . Right there with the cops and the EMTs . " She thought a minute . " Let me unload these guests and we 'll go talk . " But it was n't going to be that easy to ditch the doctors because I lilda had them in the palm of her hand , talking about the miracle of glass . She was just finishing some philosophic speech about a flowing liquid that is , for all practical purposes , rigid . Hilda glanced around at the countertop , looked up at our faces , glanced over at the vacant news desk , and then fastened on the living room . She replaced the little glass onion carefully in the rack and hurried over to the living room , stooping beside the coffee table to peer at the bud vase with its graceful neck and its single red rose . She hesitated a moment , drawing the rose from the vase , laying it on the table uncertainly . She picked up the flower again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She bent again and put the rose back in the vase . We all watched as she returned with the vase and flower , and set the arrangement gently on the counter . " Can you spare this ? " she asked Ike , like a little girl asking to borrow her mother 's pearls for the prom . " I hate to waste the flower . " " No problem , " Ike said . She reached over hastily and extracted the single red rose from the vase . Some things are not as expendable as others . I I ilda donned a pair of protective goggles , fired up her torch , and took aim at the narrow neck of the vase . " Now watch , " she said . " I 'll make what appears to be a rigid object flow for you . " She trained the blue flame on the neck of the vase and held it steady . Soon the neck sagged . Then it leaned . Then it did a U-turn  | and started running down the side of the little vase . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hektor said . " It was flowing before I touched it with the flame . It 's merely flowing faster now . " Just as it occurred to me that we were violating company policy with an open flame , Ginger Peloshian 's voice came over the intercom . " Ike , the City of New York is happy to announce that it has a bona fide fire marshal at your disposal . Right now . Shall I tell security to escort him to the studio ? " " Now ? " Ike squeaked . " Quick . Turn off that torch , Hilda . " She looked at her watch . " He 's half an hour early . He said six o'clock . " " No , my dear , " I said , " he 's half an hour late . He was supposed to be here at five . It 's all in how you measure time . " " Do n't start on me , Abby . " She gave me a harassed look . " Are you ready to do this segment ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her with what I hoped was intimacy and tender wickedness . " You used to like that about me . In fact , remember that time on Martha 's Vineyard , in the Harbor View Hotel when room service ? " She blushed a fiery red . " I 'll get you for this , " she whispered . " In public and all , you fiend . " " Keep your hair on , Ike . I was just making a deposit in the memory bank . " I was aware that everyone in the studio was focusing on us , but it seemed that Aristotle 's focusing apparatus was most highly attuned to Ike , and he looked like a race car driver who had just roared into the pit with his gas gauge on empty , only to discover that his pit crew was out on a coffee break . Nasty little surprise . Ike flashed her eyes at me . " I 'll be right back . " She hustled out . The doctors lingered a while around Hilda Murray , examining the now fused bud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition to the vinegar , the beakers held , as I knew from Friday 's rehearsal , ordinary household bleach , ordinary egg whites , and ordinary water . Olivia Quintinale picked up the egg whites and swirled the mess around in the beaker . " Egg whites , " she said . " Why egg whites ? " " Columbia 's Physics Department and Nuclear Medicine Depart-  | ment are doing some cooperative studies on DNA aging , and they suggested the eggs , " Hilda said . " It does n't really matter what substances I use for this demonstration , but I thought the egg whites would be interesting because they 're from living animals and because they 're so sticky and gooey , and the consistency is fun . But it 's not just for show . I think it makes the point about glass being so impervious to breakdown if you use something from an animal . " " What about germs ? " Aristotle asked . " That 's what I mean . When I seal these vials , the heat from the torch will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the liquid . Germs wo n't stand a chance . You open that vial a thousand years from now and it 'll still smell as fresh as it does today . " I thought about that . The egg whites might smell okay a thousand years from now , but what about Aristotle ? Ike returned with the fire marshal in tow . Since he would not appear on camera , it made no difference that he had not been cleaned up by makeup and looked like an honest-to-God fireman , with a nice , sooty smudge on his face and a red hard-hat in his hand . He was in shirtsleeves and , unlike the well-dressed doctors , did not appear to have stepped out of the dressing room at Paul Stuart , Madison Avenue clothier to the self-consciously rich . Ike , still carrying the red rose , led the fire marshal over to the kitchen counter , introduced him to Hilda , and indicated to the doctors that if they wanted to watch the taping , they 'd have to step out of the kitchen set . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the living room . He grabbed his briefcase from beside the couch and hurried back to the kitchen . But Aristotle 's opinion of staying to watch the demonstration from the sidelines got put into words . " Thanks , but we 've taken enough of your time , " he said , and gave Ike a really sickening smile . No limelight , no thanks . As Ike walked the doctors to the door of Studio 57 , I saw Aristotle sneak her a small piece of paper , slipping it into the hand where she carried the red rose . If it was n't his phone number , I 'd join his pit crew and take a vow against coffee breaks . And I saw Dr. Olivia Quintinale watching the exchange and dining an acid look at Aristotle . The muscles in her cheeks got  | tight , like maybe she was thinking what I was thinking and not liking it any better . And like she knew a little something from experience about gifts brought by this Greek . As they were all passing out through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently extinguished Virginia Slim ? complete with the full and deep fragrance of an ashtray dip on her fingers  --  waded regally in through the little crowd , leering at Aristotle Stefanopolis on her way . She stopped and turned back to face him . " Do n't I know you ? " Hannah said . " I do n't think so . But I certainly recognize you , Miss Van Stone . " She did n't even acknowledge the flattery . In her book , Aristotle had probably passed the minimum test for a civilized human being : he was supposed to recognize her . " No , " she said . " I do know you from somewhere . " She put a hand on her substantial hip and pushed up the sleeve of her gray jacket with the other hand . Ike intervened . She did n't have time for one of Hannah 's sudden whims regarding boy toys . Besides , Aristotle was too old for a boy toy , and it looked like Ike had her own plans for Aristotle , Stock Car Doctor . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be thinking of his prominence as a race car driver . " " The Winston Cup Tour ? " Hannah asked , displaying some of her depth as a storehouse for factoids . " No , " Aristotle replied . " I drive in the second tier . To do the Winston Cup , you really have to dedicate yourself to the sport full time . " " Well , why do n't you ? " " I have a demanding medical practice here in Manhattan . " Hannah lowered her professional eyelashes at him . " The doctor who races cars . " She emitted a throaty laugh , one of those that I 'm sure she rehearses while she 's sucking nicotine sticks in her office . " Well , you certainly deserve credit for something , maybe raw irony . If you 'd like to stick around and watch the show , I 'll take you to lunch . " Those of us who work on the show did not even blink , because we 're used to Hannah , but Hektor looked like something out of  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , met the challenge as smoothly as it had been issued . " I 'm afraid I 'm scheduled to assist in surgery this morning , Miss Van Stone , " he said , managing to look like he was always being asked to lunch by famous old TV queens . " But I 'm honored that you asked . " Hannah waved a hand imperiously at Ike . " Just leave your phone number with her and we 'll do it some other time . " With that , she swept over to the kitchen set . Ike stood there at the door , shaking her head gently . I watched Ike turn after a moment and shake hands with the doctors , but it was hard to concentrate on anyone else when Hannah had her mind made up to be the center of attention . She picked u p the beaker of egg whites and gave it a swirl . " My , my . Interesting consistency . How did you convince Pinkwater to donate ? " That was Hannah in a nutshell . She had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even so , Hannah knew exactly what Hilda 's beakers contained . For every segment of the show , Hannah receives a full " segment packet " that runs down the details of the projected shoot , and I know she reads the packets because she never makes a mistake on the air . Leaving the floor manager to hold Hannah 's reins , I beat a retreat back to the control room , and I did not waste time , because it was the fire marshal 's time , not mine . I passed the doctors as they headed for the Green Room to retrieve their belongings from Rubin , who was standing in the doorway waiting for them . As I passed , Hektor 's head swung around at me . His briefcase came around , too , and I had to dodge . " Mr. Abagnarro , thanks , " he said . " You 're welcome , of course , but for what ? " " Oh , you know . " He fumbled self-consciously with his glasses . " 1'or making sure I looked okay in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need a little help . That 's my Job . " " Well , thanks just the same . " By the time I took my seat in the control room , I had finished revising my first impression of Hektor . Whatever was wrong with  | his eyes , there was nothing wrong with his manners . I cued Hannah and sat back to enjoy directing this portion of the pretaping of Morning Watch . It went like a well-rehearsed spot should . Hilda , wearing the protective goggles and leather apron , applied the blue flame of her torch , which was rigged to an oxygen cylinder and a propane tank , to the slender stem of the first vial , the one she had poured the vinegar in . As the stem began to droop  --  at a temperature of 821 degrees Celsius , Hilda explained in a pleasant , matter-of-fact tone  --  I directed close camera shots . When the stem sagged and flopped over  --  at 1,552 Celsius , or 2,826 Fahrenheit ( a number I had told Hilda to add for our nonscientific audience ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because this was the best part . We had n't used fire during Friday 's rehearsal , but I knew what Hilda was about to do . " Watch this , " I told Ginger . Hilda reached her hand out and , with a deft twist of her red fingers on the hot glass , sealed the vial . Bare-handed . That 's right , bare-handed . Hannah gasped like a pro . From our monitors I could not see the fire marshal 's reaction , but he must have had one . It 's not every day you get to see someone as pretty as Hilda Murray stick her hand into the inferno and withdraw that same hand with a satisfied smile on her attractive face . Pretty woman , pretty smile , but the payload for the audience was the next close shot : the sealed vial sparkled in the intense light and glowed with the serene , cold beauty that Hilda had given it with a simple manipulation . There was no doubt that she 'd ruined her fingers in the cause of art . The little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked like it should go on a Christmas tree . In a paneled library high over Park Avenue . And only the butler would be allowed to dust it . When Hilda was finished , she had a row of four splendidly original pieces of glass , each containing a liquid  --  maybe forever . From start to finish , the whole thing took nine minutes , which we shot in real time and would probably run , without editing , in real time , even though it was a longish segment for us . The process was so neat and so absorbing that I was n't aware that Ike was breathing over my shoulder until she brushed my sleeve with hers .  | I looked up and her face was close to mine . I was inhaling the soft , hidden delicacy of her perfume . " Beautiful , " I said . " Yeah . A lot more dramatic than the rehearsal . This is so cool . I got ta say , Abby , with you , Hilda , and Hannah  --  well , we almost could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to her console , lay the red rose against the old gooseneck microphone in front of her , and put on her headset . She booted her computer , and yellow characters flashed across the screen as she pounded the keyboard . I reached up and touched her silky sleeve . She pushed her headset off her right ear . " Ike , I want you to look at this Yellow-Man tape . And I want to tell you what the guy said to me before he pulled my pockets out of my pants . " " He talked to you ? You mean , like , talking talking , or robbing talking ? " " I mean like weird talking . " Ginger played the Yellow-Man tape , and Ike watched as the camera showed the onlookers at the scene . I pointed at Tex . " That 's Tex . " " Tex ? He introduced himself ? " " That 's nothing . He also introduced me , because he knew my name before I told him . " She shivered . " That 's really yucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York anymore without someone invading your privacy . " " Yeah . Makes you think , huh ? What next ? " " As soon as we go over the lineup together , you can give me chapter and verse . I do n't know what we can do with this Tex business , but maybe we should give it to Sally . Although God knows she 's got enough on her hands producing Arden 's piece , without adding to her burdens . He 's trying to bigfoot her plan to tape him in the park and he 's insisting on doing his standup on the roof again . She said she 's ready to pull his tongue out of his head . " " I wonder why his tongue ? " " Because that 's all he 's got in his head . " We discussed the lineup for the seven o'clock news block , and  | talked about the length of the Running Out of Time interview . " It 's pretty long , " I said . " I 'm not sure how germane the raceway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yeah , I like the idea of using the racing footage , " Ike said , " because it puts some sting into the talkiness . But we have to be careful not to detract from the purpose of the piece , which is to focus on Time . Maybe we can cut some of Quintinale 's statistics and let Hektor carry the interview ? I was a little disappointed that the female doctor was the one with the least charisma . Even though it was n't our fault , I bet we get viewer calls about sexism . " " I think Quintinale 's statistics take some sting out of the medical speculation . It 's up to you , but I 'd say keep it . " At that moment , the " bulletin alert " signal sounded simultaneously on every computer in the control room . I swung my chair around and punched the function key that calls advisories onto my screen , and , at the same time , a news clerk yanked open the door and skidded into the control room with a police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he gasped , apparently having run all the way around the Tube from the newsroom . Ike was typing furiously , switching screens , and talking to her-self . I read the AP wire story . It was short . After the dateline , it read : The dead body of another apparent " Yellow-Man " victim has been found in an alley off Columbus Circle in midtown Manhattan . Early police reports indicate that the dead man 's body bears the characteristic marks of the nine previous " YellowMan " serial killer 's victims : yellow paint smeared over the face , and , thrust into the man 's shirtfront , a tattered , dirty piece of paper bearing the letters " U.S.S.R. " If the early reports are confirmed , the dead man will be the tenth victim in the series of bizarre killings that have stymied New York police for the past month . About five hours earlier on this torrid New York night , a ninth Yellow-Man victim was found in Central Park . Ike yanked off her headset and grabbed the phone . She punched numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an answer .  | " This is Ike . Get a microwave truck , a goddam camera crew , and sound technicians downstairs on the double and I want them on cell phones . And find Arden Boyer . " The AP alert had come at 6:13 . By 6:17 , our microwave truck had backed out of the garage , driven into the alley , and was sending pictures to the control room . That was probably the closest we 'd ever had a remote crew on assignment . On the monitors feeding from the truck , we could see a collection of three cops standing at the entrance to the alley that runs the length of the Emerald City , but there 's only so much cops can do about journalists . Short of pulling their 9mm. semiautomatics and smacking serious head , which is a violation of the Constitution of the United States of America , they were pretty much stuck with having us make their jobs harder . From our camera shot just at the entrance to the alley , all we could tell in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground . Or , at least , a pile of clothes attached to a pair of nice , shiny shoes . Nice clothes . Even from the camera 's point of view at the end of the alley , they were nice clothes . Clothes that could have come from Paul Stuart  --  now , perhaps , Madison Avenue clothier to the dead . And there was a black briefcase beside the clothes . Ike and I looked at each other . She was on her cell phone . " What are they saying about identifi-cation ? " she asked . Apparently , from the look on Ike 's face , they were n't saying . I shoved my headset on over one ear , grabbed my cell phone , and patched it into Ike 's connection . Sally Goldberg-Petit , the woman who was producing Arden Foyer 's piece on the night 's earlier Yellow-Man , was on the line from the street . " They 're not saying yet . These are just beat cops . "  | As she spoke , I could hear the sirens from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ betcha . " The monitors showed the captain emerging from an unmarked black Ford Crown Vic , looking disgusted . He had not yet taken the time to arrange his handsome face for the TV cameras . Ike picked up the receiver of her desk phone and shoved it against her other ear . She punched four buttons on the phone 's keypad with her thumb . We were certainly cranking up more than our usual share of the 20.5 million business phone calls made in Manhattan on an average weekday . " This is Ike . We 're going to have to cut the earlier Yellow-Man tape around this new stuff coming in . Stand by in that edit room and do n't move . Sally will talk you through it from the ground on her cell . We 'll have to do the piece live at seven , but be ready with the stuff shot in Central Park . Sally will help Arden with the narration from down there on the street , so we wo n't need the track he already recorded on tape  --  just the natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will be live . He 'll have the truck 's monitor so he can see the pictures . When you 're ready , run the tape down there to Sally , and she can feed the whole thing to us in one piece . When we hang up , call her cell . Ready ? " Ike hung up the desk phone . Into the cell phone , she said , " Did you get that , Sally ? Great . Let 's clear the line , but keep the pictures coming up here as long as you can . " It was now up to Sally to command the troops on the ground , and I could see Ike was clenching her teeth . She wanted to dash from the control room and beat it to the alley . Having a desk job is tough on Ike . She 's a hands-on journalist , never happier than when she 's crawling under barbed wire , dodging bullets , or ambushing a reluctant politician . " Abby , Ginger , let 's look at that earlier Yellow-Man again . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editing about the glassblowing segment and J.D. 's interview with the doctors , mostly telling them to have the openings cued up tight . Ginger rewound the Yellow-Man tape and up it came on the preview monitor . " Ready , Ike ? " " Just a second . " Ike made another call , this time to the Green Room . " Tony ? I hate to hang you up like this , but we need you and  | your quartz ball to stand by . We may not get to you until the second hour of the show , or we may need you on the run sooner . Okay ? " A brief smile lit Ike 's face . " Thanks . You 're a prince , Tony , no matter what Abby says . " Ginger swiveled her chair and spread her palms apart , looking a question at Ike . " Go , " Ike said . Ginger spun back and ran the tape from Central Park . When she got to Tex 's cameo role , I had her pause the tape . " Ike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glory . " " What 'd he say to you ? " Rapidly , I told her what little there was to tell . " He wanted to talk to you about a killing ? " " That 's what he said . " " Do you think he was talking about tonight 's killing in the Park ? " She pointed at the yellow face on the monitor . " This guy ? " " I have no idea . At the time , I thought he might have meant my killing . " She blinked rapidly and leaned forward over her console . " Holy shit , Abby . Look at monitor eight . " That was the remote monitor from the microwave truck , feeding us the live camera pictures . Our crew was deep inside the alley . The hazy gray of dawn had finally reached inside between the buildings , brushing out the dark shadows and dissolving the shaft of blackness around the body . " Aw , Jesus , Ike . " I swallowed . " Look at his face . It 's Hektor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paint , including his glasses . His mouth was open , a couple of silver fillings in his upper teeth reflecting back our crew 's lights in dull metallic points of grim finality . Ike rose from her chair and stepped down into the well , next to my chair , staring at the monitor screen . " This makes no sense . No sense at all . Hektor 's not homeless . Hektor 's not nameless . Hek-tor 's not like the others . He does n't fit . " " Sorry , Ike , but now he 's got the most important thing in common with the other victims . " " It 's got ta be a copycat , " she said , touching the doctor 's painted face on the monitor with the antenna of her cell phone . " I refuse to believe this is the real thing , a part of the Yellow-Man series . "  | Her cell phone rang . " Ike here . " She listened , still standing , still staring at the screen . " Tell the cops we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hektor Stefanopolis . I 'll send a clerk down with the doctor 's office address and telephone number . " She pulled several business cards out of her pocket and sorted through them quickly . She jerked the one she was looking for out of the little stack and shoved it at a news clerk and told him to get going . Before he was out the door of the control room , Ike was back at the phone giving orders . " Tell the cops we wo n't I.D . him on the air until they give us the go-ahead . But you better sure as hell tell them we get the go-ahead before anybody else gets it . The minute they 've notified next-of-kin , they notify us . If any other reporter gets it first , I 'll go down there and kill Dennis Fillingeri myself . Oh ? Put him on . " I spoke softly to Ginger and she flipped keys . The displays for the other major networks and CNN came on above us , across the top tier of monitors . We 'd know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I kept an ear on Ike 's conversation while Ginger and I started moving the live feed into the auxiliary editing unit . Down in the microwave truck , they were certainly already cutting the tape on their editing machine , but it never hurts to have backup . During pressure situations in the control room , you learn to separate your senses , letting them operate independently of each other , and while my eyes and hands were working with Ginger on the incoming tape , my ears were working on Ike , not just to eavesdrop , but because she was the center of this web of remote communications and any shifts or insights would come from her , especially now that she had collected the homicide boss himself in her web , for the moment . Since our divorce , Ike has made an off-again , on-again project of the Midtown North homicide captain . She 's flaunted him at a couple of Broadway openings and media parties , and sometimes he calls her at work . I 'm pretty sure they never got to the crucial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has rigid sexual scruples , based on her midwestern upbringing ( as opposed to the new practical scruples ) , but it 's the " pretty sure " aspect of my knowledge that gnaws at me . " Dennis ? " She said , all business . " That dead man ? That 's Dr.  | Hektor Stefanopolis . He is  --  was -- a Manhattan internist . I 've sent his address and all downstairs via a clerk . The doctor just finished taping an interview up here with us . He left the studio about twenty minutes to six . Wait a minute . Abby 's shaking his head . " " It was twenty-five to six when he left the studio , " I said . " Dennis ? Abby says twenty-five to six . You know he 's always right about stuff like that . " I waved a hand at her . " Hold on a minute , Dennis , " she said , directing her gaze at me . " What ? " " Tell him that Carl Honeyman will know what time the doctors left the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abby says . . . oh , you heard him . No , I 'm sure he knows you can do your job without his help . " She covered the mouthpiece with her hand , looked at me , and mouthed , What an ingrate . She removed her hand from the piece . " Okay , but remember , we get it first when you release the name . And , listen , when you 're done down there , can you come up here for a live interview ? " I heard some squawking over her line . " No , I do n't think that 's a nervy request . " She banged the phone down on its cradle and sorted rapidly through her little stack of business cards again . " What are you doing ? " I asked . She summoned a news clerk and handed him two cards . " Call these numbers every two minutes until you get one of these doctors . If you get Dr. Aristotle Stefanopolis or Dr. Olivia Quintinale on the phone , give it to me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Sit there and do n't take any shit from their answering services . , " Ike , Aristotle may not be next-of-kin , " I said . " I know . But if I can get any comment , we 'll have more of i ' story than anyone else . And with any luck he can speak for the family . Dennis Fillingeri may not think it 's as much of a priority as we do to release the I.D . " She grabbed the desk phone and punched numbers . " This is Ike . Are you guys awake over there on the National Desk ? I want that expert from Boston University on serial killers ? oh , hell , what 's his name ? " " Henry Amos Jankowski , " I supplied .  | " Henry Amos Jankowski , " Ike told the phone . " You know which one I mean ; all the shows have used him . I do n't care if he 's in his pajamas . Let me know when you have him . " She hung up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Is he coming up ? " She screwed her pretty face up like she 'd gagged on a lemon and went into what she thought was her Fillingeri impression . " Ike , I 've got work to do down here . You do n't think a television show is more important than solving a murder , do you ? That 's a nervy re-quest . ' " She waved her arms around over her head and wiggled her fingers . " Oh , God , I 'm such a conscientious cop . I love my job . ' " " I thought you liked Fillingeri . " " That snake . " She was back to her own voice . " What 'd he , try something on you ? " " None of your business . None of your merry little business , ex-husband . " She reached over and tweaked my nose . " What you do n't know will probably drive you crazy . Ha . Ha . Put that in your cereal bowl and see if it crackles . " " Ha , ha , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go crazy . " " Ai n't it the truth ? Ai n't it just the sad truth ? Oh , well , I 've got two million viewers biting their nails , waiting to see what I 'll do next . Stop distracting me . " The next half hour was a blur of phone calls and traffic through the control room . At 6:55 , Arden Boyer stepped into the picture I had on the live monitor . He was wearing a dark jacket and tie with a perfect Windsor knot . " Goddam it , " I said under my breath , smacking my console . I waited for him to twist his telex into his ear and then let him have it through the mouthpiece of my headset , as gently as I could , considering he had other things cluttering up his mind . " Arden , I hate to break this to you , but New York 's in the middle of a heat wave , and we 're planning to mention it at the top of the show . Kindly ditch your jacket and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reporting from two different planets  --  Earth and the one you 're on . And roll up your sleeves . " He started dragging his arms out of the jacket 's sleeves and on the monitor I could see some helping hands yanking at his tie ? Sally Goldberg-Petit , no doubt wishing she could give it a nice twist rather than yank it off .  | Just then , across the central tier of monitors , Hannah slid into the anchor chair at the news desk and , with a smooth motion , had her telex in place . " Arden , can you hear me ? " she said . Arden 's face stayed blank . " Arden , say something , " Hannah said , stacking her script into a neat pile . His face was still blank . Ike spoke into her mouthpiece . " Arden . It 's Ike . Can you hear me ? " " As loud as a fart from Capitol Hill . Who 's going to throw it to me , J.D. or Hannah ? " " Have n't you heard Hannah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ike . But I ca n't hear Hannah . " I punched the intercom . " Hannah . Arden can hear Ike , but not you . Unruffled as ever , she pursed her lips at the hand mirror Rubin Gorman was holding by her side . " Well , just tell Arden I 'll say something like You 've been at two murder scenes tonight , one apparently the ninth in the Yellow-Man serial killings , the other sufficiently different to suggest that someone is copying the YellowMan slayer 's trademarks . ' I 'll ask Arden to describe the differences he can discern so far . Tell him we wo n't be able to do a second question . " Ike put her hand on my shoulder . " I 've got that , Abby . " She spoke into her mouthpiece and told Arden what Hannah would say at the top of the news block . But , Arden being Arden , he had to ask . " What 's the matter with this thing ? Why ca n't I hear Hannah ? " I looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know , Arden . My preliminary guess is it 's broken . " " What bad timing . " " Just act like you can hear the question from Hannah and we 'll cue you when to begin . " " It 's probably the patch up there , Abby , " he said , nodding this head wisely , like he had a clue . " Everything seems okay down here . " I looked at the line clock . 6:58 . Behind me , Ike said , " Hannah , after the news block , we 'll go straight to commercials and come back to you in the kitchen to in-  | troduce the glassblowing piece . You 'll have to hop over there , because it 's only a two-minute commercial break . You and Hilda do a little patter and then we 'll go to the tape of the demonstration . The tape opens with a close-up on the torch , with the blue flame , so refer to that  --  it 's a real pretty shot . I 'll be making up the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to hold the doctor interview until we can figure out how or if to use it . We may send Tony Jones and his NASA toy to fill where we need . " Ike looked at the line clock . " Ready , Hannah ? " " On Abby 's signal , Ike . " I looked at the line clock . 6:59 . The news clerk started waving his phone 's receiver over his head . " I 've got Dr. Aristotle Stefan-stefano-you-know , " he shouted . Ike glanced at the clerk 's phone , saw which light was on , and touched the corresponding number on her phone 's pad . " Aristotle . It 's Ike Tygart . I 'm sorry about Hektor . Are you okay with us using Hektor 's name on the air ? The family knows ? Yes , I know , I 'm sorry . Please stay on this line a minute ; I 'd like a number where I can call you after eight . Okay ? " She pushed the hold button and spoke into her mouthpiece . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She pronounced it for them . I looked at the line clock . 6:59:54 . " Five seconds , " I said . " Four , three , two , one . Cue Hannah . " Ginger thumbed up the first key on her board , and Hannah said , " This is Hannah Van Stone in New York , reporting for Morning Watch , where overnight the blistering heat wave has killed three more people and where two more men have been found murdered , bearing the signature marks of the Yellow-Man serial killer . We go live now to NTB 's Arden Boyer , who is standing by at the scene of the latest murder , which was discovered within the last hour . Arden , you 've been present at two murder scenes tonight , one apparently the ninth in the Yellow-Man serial killings , the other sufficiently different to suggest that someone is copying the YellowMan slayer 's trademarks . What can you tell us about these latest episodes in the bizarre story of Yellow-Man ? " " Hannah , " Arden said , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ News has learned exclusively that the latest victim  --  apparently the tenth man to die in the Yellow-Man series  --  is a prominent Manhattan physician named Dr. Hektor Stefanopolis , a man  | who has almost nothing in common with the previous nine victims , all of whom have been homeless men . " " Whoa , dissolve , " I said to Ginger , as I heard Sally 's voice in my headset , telling me to go to tape . And there was our seamless transition : pictures of Hektor on the monitor , his yellow face , his yellow glasses , the dirty smudges on his expensive shirt , the crumpled scrap of paper stuffed into the part of the shirt where Napoleon would have put his hand if he 'd been sitting for this portrait . The only letters showing on the scrap of paper were " U.S.S. , " but I was one of at least two million viewers that morning who knew to a certainty that there was one more letter , hidden just inside the shirt . As it turned out , the Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brains over serial killers , had already changed out of his pajamas when our Beantown affiliate 's crew reached his home at 7:20 with a K-U truck . In no time , the crew had popped open their rooftop dish and we had the satellite uplink . After the break for the affiliate stations to run their local news and weather , J.D. conducted a live two-way with Dr. Henry Amos Jankowski at 7:35. 1 . D. was sitting deep in the embrace of a red leather armchair in the Morning Watch den , conversing with the expert 's face on the big-screen monitor across from the chair . And the expert was in his Brookline home next to a potted plant , conversing with a red dot on one of our remote cameras . If you wrote for a transcript of that d.iy 's program , which an unusually large number of viewers did , What you 'd get of the Jankowski interview , after the polite acknowledgments , is this : J.D. : Can you tell us if you think the so-called YellowMan killer has simply broken his pattern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is widening the field of his endeavors , or do you think this latest killing is the work of what they call a copycat ? JANKowsKI : My understanding is that the cause of Dr. Stefanopolis 's death has not been determined yet , so anything I say is a very preliminary guess . That said , however , I would at least be inclined toward a copier because of the doctor 's obvious social and economic separateness from the other victims , differences so apparent from the way he was dressed that the killer could not have mistaken him for a member of that sad brethren , the homeless of New York . It 's quite usual for serial killers to choose friendless people as their victims , because that choice itself tends to allow the string of killings to lengthen  --  the more a serial killer kills , the more he wants to kill . It 's like an addiction . And that 's the strongest reason for thinking that the death of Dr. Stefanopolis is not the work of the serial murderer . Dr. Stefanopolis , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make him a dangerous choice for this killer . J . n . : Are you saying that police investigators do not work as hard to apprehend those who prey on society 's more powerless members  --  those you call " friend-less " ? JANKowsKI : I think that 's fair to say , but only because they ca n't work as hard . You have to remember that it 's tough on the police when victims leave no friends behind . It 's difficult to learn anything about such victims , and the police have less to work with in terms of data that provides perceptions of motive and opportunity and the kinds of things that traditionally lead to the solution of murders . J . n . : Until the death of Dr. Stefanopolis early this morning , it seems that the best data the police have had to work with are the yellow paint and the cryptic " U.S.S.R. " notes . JAN K O W S K I : It 's not unusual for a serial killer to have a signature .  | The killer wants the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his work . You will perhaps remember William Hierens , who came to be called " The Lipstick Killer " because he would use his victims ' lipstick to write " Please catch me . I can not control my-self . " Always he left that same message at the scene of his murders , scrawled on a wall or a mirror . And there was Emil DeLancey , the self-styled " Snowbird of Miami . " He stuffed cocaine up the noses of his victims before he killed them . Delancey later said that he heard voices telling him to leave a sign about the power of what he called " God 's Medicine . " But the Yellow-Man killer is intriguing , to say the least , in that he makes a point of two trademarks , two overt additions to his victims  --  what I call " artifactual evidence . " And that 's very unusual  --  many serial signatures have , unfortunately , involved taking something away from the victim  --  I hope I put that delicately enough . J.D. : Well , murder is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean Jack-the-Ripper style mutilation . JAN K o w s K I : Well , yes . You 'll remember that Jeffrey Dahmer claimed to have eaten the heart of one of his victims . That 's tantamount to a cannibalistic trophy , nothing like these Yellow-Man trademarks . J. D . : Do these two very striking signatures suggest to you a particular psychological disturbance , or pattern , that the police should be looking for ? J A N K O W S K I : He 's got us all guessing , which is probably precisely what he intended . He wants us to think about him ; that 's part of the power he has given himself by embarking on murder . Those " U.S.S.R. " notes are as impenetrable as the yellow paint . The only surmise so far that has made any sense to me is that there is a political motif in the signature . Those who have suggested that the yellow paint indicates a racial motif are puzzling over their own hypotheses , because some of the Yellow-Man victims have been white , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | might call the realm of venturesome conjecture , I can offer you one thought : if the Yellow-Man victims were not already , because of their homelessness , an almost invisible society , I 'd say the yellow paint was meant to obscure identity . Of course , that applies much more nicely to Dr. Hektor Stefanopolis , who had a visible standing in society . In fact , everything about his death seems to suggest that he is not part of the pattern . J .0 . : A final question : if Dr. Stefanopolis 's death is not the work of a copycat , but is actually part of the series that has taken nine other lives , can you suggest any approach that might lead to the discovery of the killer ? In other words , does this victim 's prominence give the police , perhaps , some help in gaining entrance to the mind of the killer ? J A N x o w s x I : I expect Dr. Stefanopolis 's death will give the New York police more problems than help . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I sent Fred Loring an electronic request for graphics on both Central Park and the alley where Hektor had been found . Fred obliged quickly with topographical maps so good they looked 3-D , and the news block that opened our second hour was more lavishly produced than our first one and better illustrated , but no fatter in terms of information . Nobody was saying yet what had killed Hektor , and certainly nobody was saying who . Just after the eight o'clock news block , we scored our second coup of the morning , after scooping everyone on the identity of the body in the alley . Ike called Aristotle back , and Hannah conducted a short , intimate , breathily sympathetic on-air condolence visit with him over the phone link . Aristotle said that he had no objections to our running the interview we had taped before Hektor had died in the alley . " I do n't think there 's any harm in it , " he said , " and if it helps in any way to shed light on this morning 's tragedy , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's difficult to see what can be learned from that interview . " I did n't think there was anything in the interview that would lead  | to Hektor 's killer  --  unless the FDA had offed Hektor for badmouthing their drug approval policies  --  but it was good TV for us to have practically the last words from the victim , especially when nobody but Morning Watch had those words . And , if Aristotle 's mind worked that way , running the interview would certainly sell more books for the surviving authors than not running it  --  which is not to say that I suspected Aristotle of murder . Getting major free publicity by killing and then painting your brother/fellow author seemed outlandish as a motive even to me . We played the interview in its unedited entirety , including the spate of statistics from Olivia Quintinale , and that cold data took on an eerie significance because , while she had been spouting the numbers during the pre-show taping , she was sitting right next to the man who would soon be entering an alley to become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances , the footage of Aristotle 's miraculous escape from death in the Pocono Raceway crash was packed with hideous irony . The long Running Out of Time interview ended with Aristotle 's answer to J.D. 's question , " Can you tell us , Dr. Stefanopolis , what you were thinking when you stepped out of what was left of that car ? " It was extremely quiet in the control room in the pause before Aristotle replied , like we were all holding our breath as we watched the tape , even though we knew the answer . " I remember thinking I 'd never felt so alive . " With practiced , silent signals , Ginger and I dissolved from those words into a bumper slide and from there into a commercial block . The unnatural quiet in the control room evaporated , and we went through the motions of show production . We got through our film critic whinnying about the fact that Disney was changing certain lyrics for the home video release of Aladdin because of protests about anti-Arab bias . We weathered our meteorologists 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Eastern Seaboard and we 'd soon see the end of the heat wave , maybe by midafternoon . We did an update from the alley  --  now barred with futile police barriers that would n't keep out a single single-minded tourist  --  in which Arden Boyer , drenched in sweat , reported that " sources " had told him that police detectives were convinced that Hektor 's death was not connected to the serial killings except in the copycat  | aspects of the paint and the " U.S.S.R. " note . We called the Green Room to alert makeup to freshen up Tony Jones 's face for his trip to the den as our closing segment , to tell America about NASA 's Spinning Quartz Ball . But Tony did not make it on the show , after all , that day , because Midtown North Homicide Captain Dennis Fillingeri suddenly , and with suspicious philanthropy , decided to grant us the eleventhhour courtesy of a visit , which was sort of a coup for Morning Watch except that we all knew Fillingeri had his own reasons for doing things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the alley , push his way through the revolving door of the Emerald City , and maybe gun down our security guard , I did not stand up and applaud out of gratitude when he phoned the control room to say he 'd " take time out of my rough schedule to give NTB a rundown . " Hannah drew the short straw and faced Fillingeri across the news desk for the interview . He was about to drop a bomb , but I do n't think any of us smelled the fuse burning . Hannah started by covering the definitely lurid but now-familiar Yellow-Man code , without getting anything new . Despite her skilled questioning , Fillingeri did not let slip any little fact about Hektor 's yellow face that would send chills down the spine of America . He would n't even speculate about the " U.S.S.R. " notes . " We do n't know anything about those , " he said , raking back his thick brown hair with his fingers . " Whoever is responsible for these killings is not trying to be clear , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he trying to do ? " Hannah asked , leaning toward him across the desk . " We simply do n't know . " " Perhaps the killer is trying to distract you , throw you off the scent ? " " What scent ? We do n't have a scent . " " You still have no suspects , no course to set for the investiga-tion ? " " No . Except we 're going to treat the death of Dr. Hektor Stefanopolis like any homicide  --  meaning , we 'll look into it , period . The crime scene itself does n't look like it 's going to be any help . " He shook his head . " That paint , that note  --  maybe . But there 's nothing for us in the alley but a bad smell , like any alley in New York . " He looked down at his hands on the desk . " The au-  | topsy may tell us something , though , especially since we have a medical history on Dr. Stefanopolis , and we 'll release those results to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see Hannah 's blue eyes narrow a little as she heard that . " A medical history . You have no such histories for the other vic-tims ? " " No . " " That fact is another big difference between Dr. Stefanopolis and the earlier victims . Are you prepared to say that this latest murder was the work of a copycat ? " " It 's way too early to leap to such a conclusion . " " Is it too early for the medical examiner to have any conclusions about Dr. Stefanopolis 's death ? " " Way too early . We do n't know what killed Stefanopolis . " " But I thought all the Yellow-Man victims were knifed . " " Oh , they were knifed , all right , we know that . But , as to that , we 're not sure about cause of death . " " Certainly your office has led us to believe that the Yellow-Man killer stabbed the victims to death . They all had knife wounds in t heir chests , right ? " " We did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were stabbed , and they were . But that was n't what killed them . These people were all dead when they were stabbed . And I might add that the New York Police Department does not generally release the sum total of its information when it comes to a serial killer . " Hannah showed genuine surprise and opened her mouth , but Fillingeri went on , holding up a hand to keep her from interrupting . " The reason we have n't made this matter public is that we 've had nothing to say until now . This serial killer is working more rapidly than most , and it takes time for us to coordinate with the medical examiner 's office . All we can say for sure now is that in each case the heart stopped before the knife entered the victim . I 'm talking about the first eight , now . Tonight 's two victims may show something else . " " The police have certainly done nothing to dispel the common belief that at least eight people have died in this city from knife wounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are you telling us now , Captain Fillingeri , that someone is stabbing dead people ? "  | " I 'm telling you what the autopsies showed . " " Your autopsies turned up nothing but a negative fact ? That the Yellow-Man victims did not die from knife wounds ? How long have you known this ? " " Since the first victim . " " And you 're now telling us that you do n't have any idea what killed these people ? " " That 's exactly what I 'm telling you . The medical examiner is only as good as the information we give him , and we have n't had much to give him . We 're required by law to run an autopsy if any death occurs under suspicious , unusual , or unexpected circumstances . Well , the Yellow-Man crimes met all those criteria . The medical examiner ran standard drug scans  --  cocaine , opiates , and so on  --  and he conducted standard studies of the organs . The result is nothing . Except that four of the victims had alcohol damage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pancreas . But not enough to cause death . " " Then you do n't even know that the men were murdered ? " Fillingeri hesitated , studying his hands again . " We think it 's a fair inference that they were murdered . The circumstances . Common sense . The repeated pattern . The knifing . I do n't think that even in New York we 've got somebody going around painting corpses and knifing them as a prank . But right now , meaning as of today , the files are not classified as murder . We 're calling them ' unclassified ' deaths . " " What does that mean ? " " It means we ca n't label as natural deaths these , er , events . It means we ca n't call them murder . Not yet , anyway . " " But you 're handling the investigation , " Hannah said . " And your department is homicide . " " I 'm handling it now . " Hannah sat back in her chair and swiveled an inch or two , side to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk and gazed at it thoughtfully . " When did you take over the investigation of the Yel-low-Man , er , events ? " " Tonight . " " Why tonight ? " Fillingeri kept his face arranged in a carefully bland mask of officialdom , but he stopped looking at his hands and faced the camera .  | " Because the ninth victim , the man who died in Central Park tonight sometime around midnight or maybe a little later  --  he was in a Midtown North holding cell most of last week and got the regulation physical . He was in robust health . A man like that does n't just keel over . This was the first victim we actually have a modest medical history on  --  the little scrap of history he picked up in jail . " " Can you tell us anything about him ? His name ? Why he was being detained in jail ? " " I can tell you he was arraigned on petty theft charges and released on a P.R . bond  --  that 's personal recognizance  --  on Friday . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find family first . It 's only been a few hours . But at least we know this guy 's name and record . " " I see , " Hannah said , putting her pen quietly down on the desk . " May I ask what exactly is the status of the earlier victims from the medical examiner 's point of view ? They have no histories . Do they at least have names ? And what 's the bureaucracy surrounding nameless dead people with yellow faces ? Where are they ? " Fillingeri did n't do anything obvious to show that he was uncomfortable , but his brown eyes suddenly were n't quite so wide open and his handsome face did n't look quite so much like he was the poster boy for the Policeman 's Benevolent Association . He was usually close to perfect when presenting the police point of view on information he wanted to manage before the media got hold of it and put their own spin on it . From where I was sitting in the control room , it looked like his perfection had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A commercial . " When a homeless person dies on the street , " he said , shifting uncomfortably , " we , er , keep the body in the morgue , for two to four weeks , depending on how full the refrigerator is . " I cued Hannah to cut out , and she led gracefully into the commercial . Fillingeri breathed . " Hannah , you 're getting into an area not fit for TV , " he said , frowning . " The city buries these unclaimed people in Potter 's Field . We sometimes ca n't wait any longer than two weeks to get them under ground . We 're sending bodies out there at the rate of fifty per week . Jesus , Hannah , this is all at taxpayer expense . It costs money to store these men . Here 's the kind of grisly detail you do n't want on your show : if we do n't maintain the refrigerator at a precise temperature , between thirty-eight and forty-two degrees Fahr-  | enheit , the limbs can freeze and snap off , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And it costs money to bury these men . I can give you nasty statistics on pine boxes and rotting flesh . You want to put that on the air ? A thousand homeless drop on the street every year . " Do n't play gross-out with me , Dennis , " she said . " Snapping limbs wo n't make me faint . My eyelids wo n't even flutter . " I cued her that we were coming out of commercial . " Captain , " she said smoothly , picking up where she had left off before the break , " with a serial painter at work , would n't your department work outside the ordinary parameters concerning the homeless ? Do n't these victims have a special status because of the unique spectacle surrounding their deaths ? You yourself have said that it 's a fair inference that they were murdered . " " They 're homeless . We follow policy . " " Surely that policy , as hard-hearted as it seems , was designed for the homeless who die because they are homeless  --  from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact of their homelessness . " " Miss Van Stone , you make it sound like the police are responsible for social planning . What my men have with the homeless is more like social improvising . At least it 's not chaos yet . " " But surely the hasty burial policy was not designed for homeless people who die at the hands of a human madman ? " Fillingeri abruptly held up a hand . " Wait a minute . If you look at the history of this particular brand of homicide , juries have not generally bought into that madman defense when it comes to serial killers . Look at Ted Bundy . Arthur Shawcross . And Albert DeSalvo . He claimed he was the Boston Strangler . When he was sentenced to life in prison on charges unrelated to the stranglings , his cell-mates  --  his peers  --  took care of him . He was stabbed to death in a prison . They certainly did n't cut him any slack because he might be out of his mind . And look at the violent death of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unpopular even among other murderers . Serial killers are evil , not crazy . Most juries , even self-constituted , ad hoc prison gangs who do n't agree on anything else , still believe in old-fashioned things like the existence of evil . I 'm working on these Yellow-Man deaths , and I believe in evil , too . "  | Hannah 's posture was suddenly very correct . She was done with retracting her claws like a well-bred housecat . " Are you saying that a killer poses a moral question for the police ? " Behind me , Ike said , " Get him , Hannah . " I do n't know if she said it into Hannah 's telex , or if she said it to herself . Whichever it was , Hannah went for Fillingeri 's throat . " You ca n't have it both ways , Captain Fillingeri . You say you 're working on these mysterious deaths . But you 're transferring the corpses into the grave before you know what killed them . How would you answer criticism about such quick disposition of bodies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community standards might say that these unclaimed corpses hold crucial information regarding that very evil ' you mentioned . " " I think I 've already tried to answer that question . " Fillingeri 's voice was soft . " It 's a tough solution , but the reality of homelessness in New York City is a tough problem . " " Captain Fillingeri , questions of evil are necessarily abstract . " Hannah leaned her elbow on the arm of her chair . Changing direction . " What concrete information can you give us about the first eight victims you 've already buried ? You said that tonight 's vic-tim  --  the ninth  --  was known to you . Do you have names for any of the other victims ? " Fillingeri nodded . " Some of them . Of the first eight , we 've got positive I.D . on five . " " How did you make those identifications ? " " Fingerprints were the fastest way . They were on national file , either because of criminal records or military service . " Here Fillingeri treated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both . " " Were any of the bodies claimed , by family or friends ? " " A couple were identified by a relative or an acquaintance . Not a single one was claimed , ' meaning for burial . You see , these victims are what we call strays , ' people who do n't get reported missing in the first place and whose deaths rarely touch people who might have known them before they became strays . " " Do n't these people have any family ? " " Some are people who strayed from their families on purpose : crackheads , can collectors , street people , winos , baggers , hitch-hiker-types , crazies , drifters , prostitutes , junkies . When a serial killer gets started , these are the kinds of targets he chooses , and  | most times he sticks with that choice . They have no advocates , nobody to watch over them . It 's like they 're invisible to everyone but him . " " I ca n't help noticing that you say he , ' when you speak of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're almost always men . As a matter of fact , they 're usually white men between the ages of twenty-five and forty-five . " " Usually ? " " About ninety-nine percent of the time . " Hannah frowned . " You seem to have better statistics on this elusive killer than you have on the men he murdered . " At this point , as disgusted and fascinated as I was by what Fillingeri was saying , I had my own company 's tough policy to deal with , like the ironclad rule of getting off the air on time . I nudged Ginger and glanced at the line clock . At the same moment , Ike spoke into her mouthpiece , to Hannah . " Twenty seconds , Hannah . Wind it up and do the formula . " Two million viewers could not have had a clue that Hannah had a voice inside her ear telling her to get the hell off the air . She looked , as always , as though TV was just a thing that happened to her naturally  --  the way some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the cameras . Without any outward sign of pressure whatsoever , she ended the interview , and incidentally got the last word , by telling Fillingeri that NTB News would look forward in the coming days to any information the police cared to release , especially if they were to release it in a timely fashion , and dismissed him with a nod . A natural conclusion to a slice of life . As we closed the camera up tight on her at the desk at 8:58:10 , she said , " This is Hannah Van Stone , for Morning Watch , and until next time , I 'll be watching for you . " And Morning Watch went to black . Headsets in the control room came off , pictures up on the monitor screens flickered into oblivion , and chairs got pushed away from consoles . The news clerks cleared out to get breakfast . Ginger collected an armload of videotapes and left to call her baby-sitter . The rest of the crew picked up copies of the script and coffee cups  | stud two hard hours worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offices . Ike sat at her console , fixed in a stare at the blank screens , her arms crossed under her breasts , not moving . " Rough morning , " I said . " But it was a good show . Hannah had Fillingeri holding on to the cliff with his fingernails . There will be some public howling about this unclassified ' nonsense . For once we got caught with our pants up . " " What ? " " Never mind . " " Abby , let 's look at that tape again . " " Which one ? The live doctors or the dead one ? " " The live doctors . " " I think Ginger took it with her . " I searched Ginger 's console , but she had cleaned it as thoroughly as always . " Sorry . All gone . I 'll rack it down from Ginger or Sally or the National Desk . " She was still , sitting there like she was in a trance . " It 's just that ' s so strange , Abby , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life and death . " She gave herself a little shake and stretched a hand out for the red rose still draped against the old ooseneck microphone . She held the flower briefly under her nose and then looked up at me . " Life and death . In Hektor 's case , we have the two extremes on videotape . We 've made him immortal both ways . Is n't that a thought ? " illingeri did n't even knock before he barged into the control loom . He acknowledged Ike with a grim nod , but he gave me a leer , the spontaneous kind , not the kind he learned at the Police AL ademy on East Twentieth Street . I bring out the real thing in Filingeri.  | " Abagnarro . What a treat . " He eyed my face , which was as innocent as I could make it . " Where 's your rubber nose and seltzer bottle ? " " I 'm glad you asked , Captain . I messengered ' em to your office as soon as I heard how you 're calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be looking to add to your prop room over there at Midtown North . " " Do n't start on me about that unclassified stuff . Your show got a break when I told Hannah as much as I did . I chose to open the bag on the air , with the full backing of the commissioner . But I do n't have to defend policy or budget to you personally , Abagnarro , and God knows nobody could ever explain a medical technicality to somebody with his brains in his skates . " To my surprise , Ike piped up on my behalf . " You started it , Dennis . Is that what unclassified ' amounts to ? A medical technicality ? " " That 's what I said on your goddam show . " " Not exactly in those words , you did n't . And , Dennis , the fact of the matter is , you do have to defend department policy . You help set that policy , and we 're not just journalists  --  we 're taxpayers . It 's not like you hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all yours to play with as you like . You hold your dukedom at our sufferance . " " That 's a nice speech , Ike , " the Duke said , " but you and I both know this city is not run on ideals . It 's run on personal clout , from the highest levels down to the scum on the street . " " I happen to have plenty of clout , as well as ideals , " she said , a dangerous gleam in her luminous , mismatched eyes . " And I 'm going to pursue this autopsy hoo-hah on national television until we get an answer concerning your department 's clear failure to take responsible steps against a serial killer . If the medical examiner ca n't figure out what killed these people people , not scum , Den-nis  --  then maybe you 're not giving them your full effort . You said it yourself  --  the medical examiner is only as good as the information you give him . " " We gave him what we had . We ca n't give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but . " Ike moved restlessly in her chair . " But , what does it mean ? That the victims ' hearts stopped before they were knifed ? Stopped how ? You mean like a heart attack ? "  | " As far as I know , that 's just an expression of the timing of the events . The M.E. does n't know what made the hearts stop . " Fillingeri paused , like he was unsure about whether to give Ike more . She saw the hesitation . " Well ? What 'd you leave out ? " " It 's nothing . Certainly nothing for quotation . Just something the M.E. said . He was only kidding . " " What ? " " Ile said it looked like the victims had just stopped living . That 's hat the hearts looked like  --  just shut down . " He ran a hand rough his thick hair . " Like they were scared to death . " " People do n't die of fright , Dennis . If they did , this city would be ghost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ike , not me . New Yorkers do n't scare that sy . I put my hands together in the praying position , nodded wisely , and tried to look like the Buddha . " Be careful how you dismiss the power of fear , " I said . " You could have killed Sigmund Freud with greenery . He was terrified of ferns . " Both Ike and Fillingeri stared at me , almost like they were Freud and I was a particularly lush fern . Ike broke the silence by saying , " Jesus , Abby , where 'd you learn " Airport TV , baby . " She shook her head , tossing her curls , really serious about it like e was trying to clear her sinuses . She turned away from me and seemed to be sharing a moment of unexpected connection with the Duke of Fifty-fourth Street , united briefly by their Freud complex . Finally she said to him , " What you were saying . Some New Yorkers scare plenty . But their hearts do n't just stop for nothing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the heart with you , 11w . " He tried an ironic smile on her and turned to me . " Or to throw pies with this clown . " I nodded understandingly . " You probably want to get in some practice on the range first . I 'll be ready when you are . " I le made a noise . " The day you do anything as heroic as throw a pie . " He tucked his chin down toward his perfect blue silk tie and closed his eyes to slits , probably making up his mind to tell us why he had invaded the control room in the first place . He opened his  | eyes wide and looked up . " It 'd be really something if I had to flash my shield at you two . I 'm investigating a murder and you both have information I need . " Ike slapped her palm down on her console . " Oh , now it 's a murder . Now it 's not unclassified . " " I 'm talking about Dr. Stefanopolis . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have to wait for the autopsy ? " " You 're twisting it all around , Ike . I 'm not letting any technicality interfere with how I look into these cases . I just ca n't officially call them murders without the M.E. 's say-so . There 's mandated and sufficient communication between our departments , I 'll have you know . I 'm not a solo act . " Ike rocked back in her chair and looked at the ceiling , waving the red rose gently at her side . " Tell me something , Dennis . How many tons of paper do you use at the precinct to get to the point where you do n't know what you 're doing ? " I laughed . But Fillingeri did n't . " That 's not fair and you know it , " he said . " And if you 're so goddam keen on the police doing their job , stop grilling me . It 's supposed to be the other way around . " " You want to grill me ? " " I want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to journalist . I 'm simply going to ask a few questions , and you 're just a couple of witnesses with no special status , and we do n't need to waste your time or mine on any cracks about my department or on any high-flown bleeding liberal speeches about the homeless or about First Amendment crapola . " " The only information we have , " Ike said , " has already been made available to millions of viewers . In fact , we had more First Amendment crapola than any other network this morning . We 're doing our job . " Fillingeri grabbed the back of a chair , pulled it out from under the sound technician 's board , and spun it halfway around , parking himself on the edge of the gray cushion . " Doing your job . " He drummed his fingers on the edge of the board and narrowed his brown eyes at me . " Abagnarro , I 'd like to know how much you get paid for living off the First Amendment . " " A lot more than you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | Amendment is a part , " I said . " I 'd show you my pay stub , only I do n't know CPR . " Keeping his level gaze on me , Fillingeri opened and closed his right fist a few times , tapping it on the sound board , squeezing some substance visible only to him , maybe an imaginary pay stub  --  his or mine , I did n't know . " Freud , " he said , the squeezing operation apparently concluded to his satisfaction . " Listen , all I want is what happened before the show with those doctors , and I want the tape of the interview you carried . I 'm not even going to ask why you identified the dead man as Hektor Stefanopolis on the air without my permission . " Ike smiled at him . " We had the next-of-kin 's permission . Really , Dennis , all we did was ask nicely and the family was very gracious about it . You could learn something from that . " " You on terms with the family ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know the rules . " " Yeah . " He tapped his fist again on the sound board . " Use some of those manners and tell me about the doctors before , during , and after the taping of that interview . You know , like when they arrived , what they ate and drank , did they have an argument  --  you know the kind of thing I 'm after . " " They arrived before Abby did , so I 'd say it was about threethirty . Did you check with security downstairs ? " He nodded . " Go on . " " Then I took them to the Green Room and talked them through the questions we 'd be asking them during the interview  --  they wrote a book about medical research . And Rubin Gorman did their faces . You know Rubin ? " " Yeah . The fat guy . " " Rubin has other qualities , Dennis . Anyway , they talked a little bit with our other guests  --  Hilda Murray , a glassblower from Columbia University , and Anthony Jones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual stuff in the Green Room . " She touched the red rose to her lips and seemed to be contemplating the fragrance . " But , Grandmother , what odd questions you have . What 's this about what the doctors ate and drank ? " " Off the record ? " " Until I get it from a different source . " Fillingeri seemed to go into conference with himself . Then he  | nodded , apparently to his inner conferee , and said , " Dr. Stefanopolis did not have a mark on his body . No knife wound like the others . No nothing . No bruises , no gunshot wound , no scratches , no nothing . Nada . Zilch . A great big blank . Bupkiss . " " So , " Ike said , still breathing the rose , " you 're looking for poison . " " We 're looking for anything , " he said gruffly . " The doctor did n't get killed by the stink down there in the alley . " Since I had not been in the Green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to contribute but a growing conviction that Fillingeri was not only at a complete loss regarding Hektor 's death but was also personally embarrassed about it , like maybe he was wishing he had n't waited to step into the picture until the ninth victim got it . " Captain , " I said , " you have n't even got a place to start , have you ? " " With the other Yellow-Men , no . With Hektor Stefanopolis , yes . Rule number one about murder , Abagnarro , is that to kill somebody , you have to get close enough to do it . Make sense so far ? " I nodded , a good pupil in the Dennis Fillingeri School for Cre-tins . " With Hektor Stefanopolis , unlike the other men with painted faces , we can start with people who were close to him , " he explained , making sure I was sound on the fundamentals before we went on to advanced material . " You mean like family , co-workers , maybe even co-authors ? " I said . " Very good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips , too . But also people who could get physically close enough to him to kill him . Like the people who saw him last . Like the people you had on your show today . Like the people who worked on your show today . Maybe even like you , Abagnarro . " I made a noise . " I 'm not going to ask you to translate that into human , " Fillingeri said . " What I can ask you is did you know Hektor Stefanopolis before he came on Morning Watch ? How 'd he get on the show ? " " I did n't know him from Adam , " I said . " And I still do n't . How he got on the show is he wrote a book . I hardly ever kill people who write books . "  | " Somebody killed him  --  between your studio and that alley . That 's not much distance , and that 's not very many people . At least we 've narrowed it down to a small group . With the previous Yel-low-Men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and maybe commuters . Now we want to narrow it further . " " And you 're looking for poison on the twenty-seventh floor of this building ? " " I 'm looking for motive on the twenty-seventh floor of this building . " " I do n't know of any motive to kill Hektor . In fact , if someone had to get it , I 'd have picked the other brother . You know what he does ? He races ? " " Dennis , " Ike said , interrupting me with a fierce frown , " your best bet on food and drink will be Rubin . He was in the Green Room most of the time with them . " " I 've got an officer taking his statement now . And I know about the race cars . " Ike was waving her rose around in the air . " It 's no crime to race cars . I wish you 'd stop it , Abby . " One of the petals dropped off the rose and fell on the carpet . She bent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have a question , Dennis . How did the cops find Hektor 's body so fast ? " " Nine-one-one from a dog walker . " Fillingeri rolled his eyes . " I could n't believe it when I saw the dog  --  a white poodle with golden bows on his ears and a rhinestone necklace . I thought those little French fright wigs just dumped on the carpet and never needed walking . " 1 swiveled my chair so I could stretch my legs into the aisle . " I have a friend who owns a blue iguana . That thing crawled up the leg of the table one night at dinner and pissed all over my salad . " Fillingeri sighed . " Abagnarro , although I 'd like to meet the animal that pissed in your food , I hope you 're not leading up to one of your stories . " " I 'm not . Unless you want to hear the one about the science convention and the ugly man ? " He brushed his hand across the console like he was clearing off a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funny . " " You probably just did n't understand it . " " You know , I hope you 're right . It almost makes me glad to  | think I did n't understand that story . That would mean that you and I do n't think alike . I like that . " " I could explain the joke to you . " " No , thanks . What I want you to explain , either of you , is everything that happened next , outside the Green Room , including a copy of that interview . I do n't mean a transcript ; I mean a video-tape . " Now Ike heaved a sigh , dropped the rose on the console , and gave Fillingeri a verbal guided tour of her morning with the doctors , up to and including the point where Aristotle had given her his phone number . That made Fillingeri 's face get a little darker under his tan , but he let the fact pass without comment . My only contribution was that I thought there was something wrong with Hektor 's eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Guests seldom thank the director , or even understand what the director is doing for them , " I said . " Hektor understood . " " Congratulations , Abagnarro , you should have been a doctor yourself , " Fillingeri said . " There sure as hell was something wrong with Hektor Stefanopolis 's eyes . They call it glaucoma . " He shifted in the chair . " By the way , about Hektor understanding what a director does  --  I 've never seen you do anything . Do n't you just sit there and look at the pretty monitors and tell people to do things they already know they should do ? " " That about describes it , Captain . " I pulled my legs back out of the aisle and put them up on the gray cushion of the chair across from me . I smiled contentedly . " What a life , huh ? The only difficult part is making sure I do n't crease my trousers . " Ike stood up and started for the door . " Are we finished , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arm . " I am . You and Abby ca n't resist playing cowboys and Indians . I do n't know what your problem is with each other , but it 's counterproductive and . . . " She gave us each a salvo from her mistily beautiful eyes . " If it has anything to do with me , you should keep it to yourselves . It 's not fair to make me watch the games you play . " She looked down at Fillingeri 's arm , which he moved , and she left , closing the door behind her . Fillingeri and I sat in silence for a moment . " I was n't playing games , " he said .  | " I was . She 's right . " Ile stood up . I stood up . " Abagnarro , you 're fond of old Sicilian sayings , right ? " " So ? " " Nun perdere tempo cu li Siciliani ; ce tutto di perdiri e nente di uadagrani . " " I did n't know you were Sicilian , Captain . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the boot that looks like ' s about to kick Sicily out of the Mediterranean . " " Ah . Well , here 's a little geography update for you , Captain . Sicily 's still there . " I smiled , one of those tight papal smiles that could mean anything . " You think I 'm trying to get in your way . Maybe I am . " I lost the smile . " But consider this : you have a lousy way of asking for what you want ; it 's that nasty habit of sticking your hand out to grab . " I went to the door of the control room . It occurred to me that ving him what he was grabbing for would give me what I wanted : ss of his company . " You chose the wrong Italian proverb , " I said . " There is something to be gained from Sicilians . If you 'll please follow me , Duke , I 'll be happy to get you that little videotape you requested . " It was nice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by ratty kindness . It was like having a highly intelligent doberman on ply leash : he could bite my head off , sure , but then who 'd bring him the nice pot roast he had his eye on down the hall behind the locked door that I had the key to ? We walked along the Tube , Fillingeri making a point of not walking behind me , and stopped at Sally Goldberg-Petit 's office door , which was open . She was n't there , but Fillingeri gave the brass nameplate on her door a good look . " I low do you pronounce that ? " Fillingeri asked , looking at the name like it was Chinese . " Like in the story of the world 's laziest man . " A pained look descended over Fillingeri 's handsome features . " I hate your stories , Abagnarro . " " Just listen . There was this really lazy guy who brought home a ferociously nasty pit bull  --  worse than most of them , a real bastard . So his wife starts crying and says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dog like that ? ' " I looked at Fillingeri and leaned against the door , pretending I was Ernie . " Do with it ? What do you mean do with it ? That 's the beauty of this dog , Alice . We do n't have to do anything . Jeez , the guy who sold it to me said we should n't even pet it . ' ? " That supposed to be funny , Abagnarro ? " " It 's supposed to be educational . Sally Goldberg-pet it . " " Thanks . Now I know . " " And I bet you 'll never forget . " I entered Sally 's office and glanced around at the newsjunk and piles of videotapes . " Sally should have all the stuff from last night 's killing in the park , as well as what we shot in the alley this morning . She should also have a copy of the long interview with the doctors , because she 's working on a piece for tomorrow . " Sally arrived at her door , with a can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across her forehead . Her short dark hair was frizzy from being outside in the steam bath of the alley , and her hands and chin were dirty . " Abby , if you 're looking for my can of yellow paint , I threw it out . What do you think , I 'm stupid ? " " No , we 're looking for clues about your sex life , Sally . Captain Fillingeri 's interested in getting close to people on this floor . " Fillingeri forced his face not to react , but his broad shoulders tensed under the starched white brilliance of his shirt . Despite the starch , his shirt could n't disguise the fact that Fillingeri pumps as much iron in the police gym on Twentieth Street as any other member of the force in Manhattan . " Forget the clues , " Sally said , openly eyeing the effect of the iron . " I do n't have a sex life , Abby . How could I ? With my hours , the only guys I ever see are Arden Boyer , who almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Loring , who 's certainly getting it on with his computer , and you . " " Me ? What 's the matter with me ? " " You 're still in the Honeymoon Suite with Ike , if only in your heart . You are a U.A.S. " " What 's that ? " I asked suspiciously , hyper-aware that Fillingeri was listening to this catalog of NTB male losers . " Un Available Stud . " I smiled sweetly first at Sally , then turned it on Fillingeri . " Let 's get this over with , Abagnarro , " the captain said , or maybe  | snarled . " I 've got better things to do than listen to kindergarten sex . I asked Sally for the interview tape and turned her over to Fillin-geri . " I 'll take you down to editing , " she told him , " and we 'll dub the tape you want . I ca n't let you have the original . " She gave Fillingeri a good , hard , assessing look . " I wonder if you 're an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " You left off one S ' . " I walked a few paces down the Tube and stopped at Ike 's door . She was seated at her desk , watching the video playback machine beside her computer . There they all were again , Hektor and Aristotle and Olivia and J.D. I stepped inside and planted myself on her couch , shoving aside some of her newstoys , including a piece of charred wood from the Waco Apocalypse of David Koresh . " You found the tape , " I said . " Bo Peep could 've found this tape . There must be eighty copies by now , all over the building . With the cops and the other NTB broadcasts breathing down our necks , we 'll be dubbing videotape until the end of time . " " Why are you so interested in this interview ? " I asked . " Or am I just being obtuse about Aristotle the Great ? Is he Fillingeri 's re-placement ? " She gave me a look like I was a blue iguana crawling toward her salad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain Fillingeri because Captain Fillingeri never got a place , not that it 's any of your business . And , for your information , I 'm looking at this tape because it 's all I 've got to look at until my meager staff of producers brings me something else to look at . " " Like Fillingeri 's head on a platter , for that autopsy baloney ? Unclassified deaths ? " " That would do for a start . Or some hard information on burying a person who 's homeless and lacking the formality of a death certificate . I 've asked Sally to put together a piece on New York City 's Potter 's Field for this Friday . It 's out on some scrubby island in the East River , or Long Island Sound . We 'll send off the week on Time with a visit to the eternal resting place of the address -- impaired. "  | " Kind of a bummer farewell to Morning Watch 's week on Time . " " Yeah , well , death 's a bummer , " she said , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially if you happen to be homeless . You die homeless , you get buried homeless . You get to be homeless for eternity . St. Peter wo n't even have to ask any questions when you arrive at the Pearly Gates . He 'll take one look and say , Ah , a homeless person . Go to Hell . ' " She ran both hands through her blond curls , pulling a little as she went . " This whole Yellow-Man thing stinks of corroded bureaucracy . " " A policy is a policy is a policy in the Naked City  --  the Bare Apple . How many homeless people do you think there are here ? " She stopped pulling at her hair and grabbed a sheet of paper off her desk , tugging it out from under her keyboard , and read from it . " The homeless population of New York City is greater than the population of Greenland . That 's a whole country , Abby . " " Well , yeah , but it 's not much of a country . I mean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then . The homeless population of New York is bigger than the population of Bermuda  --  another whole country . You ca n't say that one 's too cold to count . The same with the Virgin Islands , the same with French Guiana , the same with goddam Monaco . Now there 's a nifty comparison : New York 's homeless population amounts numerically to the princes , nabobs , and playboys of Monaco . Ha ! The March of Progress . " " Ike , give me a number . " " I 'll give you an American number . You ever heard of a little community called Galveston ? " " As in Galveston , Texas ? " " Bingo . That 's the size of our homeless population . On our streets  --  the population , the entire population , man , woman , and child , of Galveston Fucking Texas . Sixty thousand humans . My hat 's off to the Big Apple . We 've absorbed a decent-sized city into our midst without most of us feeling anything but a slight inconvenience . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nobody 'd stand up and cheer about how the view had changed . We might not even notice . Betcha people would notice if the population of Galveston disappeared . " The videotape reached the end of the interview , ran past the junk studio footage , and then the high-pitched screech came out of the  | machine as it automatically rewound the tape . Like punctuation for Ike 's lecture . I ere , I thought , is a woman who needs cheering up . " I do n't suppose you 'd like to hear the story about the science convention and the ugly man now , would you ? " " Do n't be repulsive . " " Then let 's look at that tape together . Maybe the car crash will give me a laugh . " " You 've started to get a thing about Aristotle . What 's your problem with him ? " " The part where he plays around with death machines . The part where he puts himself inside the death machines and drives them round in a circle trying to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped thinking of him as a doctor as soon as I saw that tape . " " Abby , you of all people should understand the lure of speed . You skate like , well , like lightning . " I was stunned . " How can you compare that to auto racing ? " " The way I just did  --  the thrill of speed . " " They 're not the same . I , for example , am extremely unlikely to plow into a wall , flip over several times , and burst into flames . " I put my feet up on her coffee table . " In fact , it 's extremely unlikely that anything bad will happen to me on skates . I 'm too good to take a fall . " Her hand shot out and she pointed a finger at me . " That 's it . That 's what you have in common . It 's that arrogance . You think you 're so hot you ca n't lose . It 's the same with Aristotle . " " Play that tape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed skating can compare to that idiot 's pastime . We 're not even the same animal . " " Oh , yes you are . It 's that animal thing that 's left over from when you were swinging through trees and the ape who swung the fastest and farthest got to plant his seed in the choicest female . " " And just where were you choice females while all this tree swinging was going on ? " " Inventing a way to walk upright so we could get out of the Jungle . " " Are you saying that females were the first to walk upright ? " " Archaeology says it  --  the skeleton is called Lucy , ' not ' Luciano . ' " She pushed the play button , fast-forwarded through  | the book talk , and resumed normal speed at the point where J.D. introduced the crash tape . We watched Aristotle 's car flip again into the infield at the Pocono Raceway and we watched him step out unhurt . " What a crock , " I said . " He was thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bet . What a two-ton crock . " " If you 're such an expert on Dr. Aristotle Stefanopolis  --  or apes  --  why do n't you tell me what he was really thinking ? " I stood and took the remote from her hand . I rewound a bit and then paused the tape . " Okay . Remember he 's a doctor , Ms. Tygart . I 'll tell you what Doctor Death and Demise was thinking . " I played the monumental series of flips in slow motion and ad-libbed some narration , calling upon the deepest reserves of my medical vocabulary as the car somersaulted in slow , bumpy circles : " There he goes , and he 's thinking : Oh , my God , my shoulder . ' And again : Holy cow , that was my pancreatic artery . ' Again : Oh , no , my right femur . ' Watch this : Christ , my gluteus maximus . ' And now , as the fender goes flying : Shit , my lymph nodes hurt . ' This one 's great , Ike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Finally , look at all that smoke : Jesus , somebody bring me a bed pan . ' " As Aristotle stepped , still in slow motion , out of the Plexiglas-and-metal trash heap that had once been a car , I tossed the remote onto Ike 's lap and said , " It 's a little hard to believe he was thinking , Wow , I feel so alive . ' " Ike put her head down on her desk . " God . Why 'd we leave the jungle ? " Fillingeri was around the Emerald City most of the morning , talking to the staff and poking and prying in Studio 57 , the Green Room , the control room , and the editing rooms . The ripest fruit hanging from the grapevine was that he had double-teamed Tony  | Jones in the Green Room with a couple of homicide lieutenants , and that both Aristotle Stefanopolis and Olivia Quintinale had been issued invitations to join a little get-together at Midtown North . And Hilda Murray was receiving guests in blue uniforms in her lab at Columbia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be having any special difficulty shaking off official attention was Rubin Gorman , our already overworked makeup artist , but according to the rumors , that was only because he was the closest thing we had to a guardian for the Green Room . But he 'd been in and out of our guest suite tending to the anchors , and , rumor said , the doctors and the man from NASA and the glassblower had been relatively free to play tag in the hall , if that 's how they 'd spent their time before the show . But Fillingeri and his crew were n't as much of a pest as NTB 's own Evening Watch . Since that program has about six times our audience , they all think that those of us who work on the morning show are untalented , unwanted , untrained , probably unwashed , and certainly unprincipled . That morning I showed them our uncooperative side , but not until they asked for it , in the person of Tom Hitt , their Broadcast Producer and Executive Shark . A few associate producers from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our videotapes and our memories and so on . They were asking who we liked for the murder : The brother , the one who drove race cars and obviously enjoyed dangerous pursuits ? The ex-wife , was n't it always the wife ? That glassblower with the red fingers , and was n't that suspicious , those red fingers , could she have been overdoing it with turpentine to get the yellow paint off ? Would n't that make her fingers red ? Or did we think Tony hones had gone after Hektor because ... and that 's where the speculation stopped , because nobody had even a smell of a motive for Hektor 's murder . Some of the Evening Watch sleuths , the ones who prided themselves on not belonging to the Geraldo Rivera Lurid School of Broadcasting , wanted to know if there was anything from the direc-tor 's point of view that would give them a lead on the story of Hektor Stefanopolis 's having joined the Yellow-Man Club , and when I told them no , they went off and read the Times or called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other people from our  | show , but the head shark came straight for me . And he had an entirely different approach to the doctor 's death . At first I thought the shark was merely engaging in our usual heckling contest , but I should have known that he smelled blood . I was on the phone , ordering a maintenance check on the remote link that had failed before the show and forced us to dummy the Q and A between Hannah and Arden , when the shark entered my office . Tom Hitt  --  Ike 's opposite number on the evening program and a media giant at age twenty-eight  --  had a reputation for a mean spirit and a notched belt that included manipulating the Evening Watch White House reporter into sleeping with him so he would n't send her to the Asia Bureau to do stories on the Chinese bicycle industry . He began my torture session by saying , " If your I.Q. were any lower , Abagnarro , we could use your brain to clean black-boards . " Since he started it , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair about that is that Tom 's ten inches shorter than I am . " If you were an inch shorter , Tom , you could n't even reach the blackboard . " " I ca n't reach it now . " Tom 's too important to be bothered by the fact that he 's five-three and has to buy his pants in the boys ' department . " But since the only menial task I ever do is wash my hands in the men 's room , and I can reach my own hands just fine , who cares ? " " That 's manual , ' not menial . " " Oh , yeah . I still do that myself , too . " " What do you want , Tom ? You think I 'm having a sale in here on ladders ? " He snorted . " That 's not a bad idea , even for you . You could probably use the cash . I hear you got mugged . " I looked down my nose at the top of his head . " Your ears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " People will often get down on their knees for a chance to hobnob with me . " " Then it was n't Ike who told you about the mugging . She would n't get on her knees for you if she thought you had the answer to the riddle of the universe . " A kind of far-away gleam entered his gray eyes , usually steely and  | dead like an old crocodile 's . " The Untouchable Ike Tygart . There may come a day for even that , Abby . " " Does the phrase Get out of my office ' have any meaning for you , Tom ? " " Oh , I would n't dream of staying here . " He glanced around at my stuff , sighing ever so minutely at the meagerness of my one and only Emmy , which , when I followed his gaze , I noticed really needed dusting . Tom has four Emmys in his statuary collection , all nice and shiny , lined up in a tidy row on a ruthlessly dusted cherry credenza with a mirrored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peabody , a knickknack I 'll never get a chance to hold my breath over when they bend close to the microphone and say , " And the winner is ... " " I only came down this way , Abby , to see what you could tell me about the mugging . I do n't want you to think I 'm interested in the thugs you choose to carouse with on your way to work . I 'm interested because Evening Watch got the grapevine flash that your personal thief was at the scene of last night 's first Yellow-Man , the one in the park . " " Then it must have been Ginger who told you . " " That 's what I mean about your I.Q. , Abby . You jump to fatuous conclusions . The spy in your camp happens to be one of your ambitious news clerks , thinking that he could buddy up to me and get a real job on my show . Ginger Peloshian would n't give me the time of day . " I looked at my wrist . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " But what about the mugging ? Evening Watch is going after that guy . " The mugger ? " " Yes . The word is that you actually had a conversation with the guy before he bounced you on the sidewalk and walked away with your family jewels . " A shadow fell across the doorway . Ike stood there , flashing me an urgent message from her green and blue eyes . " The jewels are just where the family left them , " I said , although I would have added something choice I once heard in a New York Giants locker room if Ike had n't been standing there . " And there 's nothing else to tell . He took my money and ran , that 's all . There 's eight million stories like mine in the Naked City . "  | " Ca n't you describe him or anything , I mean , beyond what your crew got on tape in the park ? What did he say to you ? " " Gee , you know , my mind 's a blank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something . Or maybe it 's like you said about my I.Q. Suddenly I just ca n't think . " Tom turned and walked out the door , brushing against the blue silk thing Ike was wearing . I could hear the touch from where I stood , five or six feet away . In the Tube , he turned back and looked at me . " Abby , I may talk to the owner about your unwillingness to cooperate with his network 's flagship news broadcast . Othello Armitage likes team players . " " You 're scaring me , Tom . I do n't think that 's going to help my amnesia any . He squeezed his eyes almost closed , like he could buzz my hair with the bolt of heat he was sending out through the narrowed slits . " We 're committing our resources to this story . I give Hannah and Ike great credit for getting that interview with Captain Fillingeri . But Evening Watch is going to own the Yellow-Man story . " " Well , good , " I said . " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer to the riddle of the universe . " I sat back down in my chair . " Happy hunting . Stay busy . What are you gon na do ? Start at the Battery and work your way north , block by block , looking at hands for traces of yellow paint ? " " No , that would be a waste of my I.Q. " He switched to a cryptic smile , the kind intended to show that the interior designer who had worked on the furnishing of Tom 's skull was the kind specializing in trick mirrors , hidden staircases , false-bottomed chairs , and slick hardware . " I 've got several ideas . " " I would n't know anything about ideas , what with my I.Q. and my memory loss . " I glanced significantly at Ike 's figure , backlit for me from the fluorescent lighting in the Tube , and tapped my forehead . " But up here , Tom , is a videotape you 'll never get to see ? some guys do n't have to know the answer to the riddle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing the smug look on his face disappear for a fraction of a moment . Then he walked out of sight down the Tube . Ike stepped into my office and flopped onto my couch .  | " What 's this stuff about the universe ? " " Tom 's thinking of submitting his coverage of Yellow-Man for a Nobel Prize in astronomy . " She made a noise , not a dainty one . " He 's trying to steal my idea . " " About astronomy ? " " About your mugger . " " Tex ? " " How many muggers do you have , Abby ? Of course I mean I'ex . " I got up and closed my door . " Not so loud , Ike . I do n't think Tom has the name yet . His gossip , not unlike himself , is a little short . " She smiled . " I used to think Tom could n't help being the size of one of the smaller Vienna Choirboys . But lately I 've decided that he stunted his growth when he took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . It was a rare moment for us , when the timing on smiles worked this well . " So all the producers at NTB News are now volunteer detectives ? How come ? " " With Evening Watch , I think it 's that they finally have a victim they approve of . Worthy , you know ? A doctor  --  moreover , a white doctor , a rich white doctor , a rich and prominent white specialist who wrote a book . Lots of cultural goodies . " " Some of the other victims were white . " " Yeah , but no homeless white man gets as high a news score as a white man with a pricey address . Not from Evening Watch . " " Maybe so , Ike . But I suspect the real reason for Tom 's interest is that Yellow-Man has turned into one of those what-the-fuck stories . You know , are these serial killings or something else ? Are the police hiding something ? Is the medical examiner practicing voodoo ? It reminds me of the flap over Nancy Reagan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Watch milked that story ? They loved it because they got to flex their eyebrows and skirt the edges of editorializing , show America how much smarter television is than government . " " But Nancy Reagan was before Tom 's time , before what I think of as the Napoleonic Complex Era . " " I know . But Tom 's on board the train of tradition and YellowMan is now an Evening Watch kind of story , the kind they 've always  | secretly loved while outwardly clicking their tongues . They hide the National Enquirer inside their copies of The Washington Post . You , on the other hand , do n't usually go ga-ga just because some aspect of American public life looks like Halloween . What gives ? " " With me , it 's two things . Number one , I feel a little responsible , because I got Hektor on the show and therefore in a position to be killed in that alley . " " That 's Fillingeri 's you got ta get close to a person ' theory warping your brain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spot when somebody decided to kill him . " " I do n't , exactly . But somewhere I feel a responsibility . That 's not the same as guilt . You know what I 'm talking about  --  you 're the one who explained to me the difference between guilt and responsibility , after the divorce . " I looked down at the surface of my desk , not seeing the clutter . I was seeing the sad look on her face when she had found out about my " responsibility " with another woman . " Let 's not go over that again , Abby . I only brought it up to explain how I feel about Hektor . The other thing is the bomb Fillingeri dropped about the autopsies and the burials  --  cut ' em up and pop ' em in the ground as fast as the city can . Unclassified ' is what we Missourians call warm road apples . ' I do n't mean to go ballistic or anything , but I think we should make a decent effort to find Tex . He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was right after he 'd been in the park with Yellow-Man number nine . If it turns out that Tex is a red herring , well , I 've got a couple of other things to try . " " Like what ? " " Come with me . " She stood , and I could hear the swish of her silk again , but this time it sounded pretty . " Let 's go see Fred Loring . " " Is he conducting free seances ? " I smiled at her again , but this time a little guardedly . " Why are you being so nice to me ? " " Because you 're the man who was mugged by the man who may know what we want to know . In fact , he may be the man we want to know . " She winked at me , with the blue eye open . " But be careful what you say around Fred . He gossips with Tom . " " Fred does n't gossip with anyone , unless it 's the spirit world . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mouth gossip . He 'll  | probably just end up telling Tom that the killer is a Gemini , with his moon in Virgo , and that the Kama Sutra is out to get him . " She laughed . We strolled companionably along the Tube together until we reached the Green Room , where we stopped . Fillingeri was seated on one of the makeup chairs , facing Anthony Jones , Ph.D. , NASA 's one-man travelling quartz ball show . " Tony , " I said , surprised to see he was still there . " Are you renting space here ? " The look on his face was not happy . " Abby , tell this policeman that I 'm not the Boston Strangler . " I laughed . I took a seat on the coffee table , next to the steel NASA box . " Captain Fillingeri 's not looking for the Boston Strangler . He 's looking for the New York Unclassified . " I looked at Fillingeri . " What are you , the NYPD 's Bad Will Ambassador ? " Fillingeri 's face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said you were a killer , Dr. Jones . But the guard down there in the lobby says you left the building just before the Stefanopolis brothers and Olivia Quintinale , around five-thirty . And you came back inside around five forty-five , before Ike sent her commando camera crew to the alley . That does n't make you a killer , but it could make you a valuable witness . " " I went out to smoke a cigarette , " Tony said . " There 's a nosmoking policy in this building . All I did was stand outside the big green doors and light up . I was in sight of the guard the whole time . Ask him . I did n't go anywhere near the alley . " " How 'd you get back upstairs to the twenty-seventh floor ? " I said . " Carl Honeyman would n't allow even me up without I.D . " Tony shrugged , like it was no big deal . " Since I was already signed in on the logbook before I left the building , Carl issued me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done it before when I 've been on the show . " I swore . I shook my head . " God , a congressional subcommittee must be writing the security manual for this building . " Fillingeri gave me a look . " The security in this building stacks up fine , Abagnarro . But what about your own ? The word is you got mugged . Which is what I hear but which is what I do n't believe . " " You do n't believe I was mugged ? " " Nope . Not you . "  | " Why not ? " " I do n't know what you know about making television , but I know what you know about New York : you navigate the streets of this town as well as anyone . If you got mugged , it was on purpose . Which I do n't believe . So you were n't mugged . " " Well , that 's good to know . What a relief . Now all I have to worry about is the magician who made my money and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime to the proper authorities ? " I gave him a look . " I do n't know any proper authorities . " " I 'm sure that 's supposed to mean something , Mr. Television Director , but right now I 'm too busy to work out the frantic convolutions of your mind . Get out of here and let me work . " " People are so interested in my mind today . I wonder why that is ? " I crossed my legs at the ankles , getting comfortable . " If Tony had a ringside seat to this murder , I see no reason why we should n't hear what he has to say . He 's our guest , not yours . NASA has nothing to gain by sucking up to the NYPD . " Tony flipped a hand impatiently . " I did n't see anything , no matter who 's asking . Aristotle and the woman caught a cab going uptown , and , if you want me to tattle , it looked like they were having an argument . I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back inside . I went up in the elevator . I went to the Green Room . That 's it . " Fillingeri ran his hand through his hair . " You did n't happen to follow Hektor into the alley did you , Jones ? " " No . I already said that . " " You did n't see anyone else around ? " " No . " " Did n't hear anything ? " " No . I mean , nothing but what you 'd expect to hear . You know , traffic . " " The security guard says he was n't watching the green doors while you were outside . " Tony slumped in the chair . " That 's just great . " " Today was the first time you met Hektor Stefanopolis ? " Fillingeri said . Tony sat up straighter in his chair . " No. "  | Fillingeri pounced on it immediately . " You knew Stefanopolis ? " " Only slightly . Hardly at all . His brother Aristotle worked on the medical debriefing team for astronauts up until about two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weightlessness on the neurological system and so on . Aristotle was one of the chief advisers on the ground , and I saw him around KSC . We played golf with Hektor once when he was down in Florida for a vacation . Once . We played golf once . " " KSC ? " " Kennedy Space Center . " " Did you and Aristotle reminisce about old times this morning , talk about the project , anything like that ? " " I 'd really rather not bring all this up during a murder investigation , Captain , because it 's all ancient history and completely irrelevant , but Aristotle Stefanopolis and I do n't talk to each other . He testified at congressional hearings on the NASA budget , with disastrous results for some of our programs . He is no longer on the NASA payroll . " Tony shifted in the dainty makeup chair . " I guess he did what his conscience told him to , about the greater need for medical research here on earth , but he 's not exactly my favorite doctor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testimony will never be measured . Congress is even now getting ready to cancel the High Resolution Microwave Survey . " " What 's that ? " Fillingeri said . " A project to scan space for radio waves emitted by alien civiliza-tions . " " No , I mean what 's that in dollars ? " Tony moved in his chair , suddenly uncomfortable . " A million a month . " " And Aristotle Stefanopolis thought that was a little steep , just to phone some Klingons ? Imagine that . " Tony shrugged . " We 're talking to industrialists , looking into getting private funding for the project . " " It 's about time you guys at NASA realized that taxes are private funding . " Fillingeri shoved a hand through his hair before he shook his head at Tony . " Phoning Klingons on my money . " " It looks like you share Aristotle 's view of the hunt for extrater-restrials. "  | Fillingeri gave Tony a hard look . " Aristotle . That 's the brother who 's alive . His brother Hektor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nasty to NASA ? " " Not that I ever heard . " " Did you talk to Hektor today ? " " I do n't think he even recognized me , Captain . " " You could have reminded him . " " I did n't feel like it . " " There something wrong between the two of you ? " " Not at all . It was early , I was thinking about doing the spot on the show , we were all busy . My previous acquaintance with Hektor Stefanopolis was so slight as to be meaningless . One round of golf . " Fillingeri rose from his chair and went to stand at the table of cold food . He could n't even help himself to some ham and bread because all the food was under wraps supplied by evidence technicians from his own department . He looked hungry . He turned the hungry look on Tony . " So if it was Aristotle that was found dead in the alley , you would n't be heartbroken , is that right , Dr. Jones ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if anyone were murdered . I did n't hate the guy . " " How much money did he cost NASA at those hearings ? " " Nobody can say for sure about the direct effect of his testimony , but we lost more than three billion in the last two years . " Fillingeri took his time chewing on that sum . " Three billion . That 's a lot of money not to hate a guy for . " " It 's not my personal money . " Tony glanced at the steel box on the table beside me , almost like he wanted to be sure nobody was going to take it away from him . Like it was his personal steel box . " But Aristotle Stefanopolis is still alive , Captain . What difference does it make if I hate him or not ? " " I do n't know . Maybe none . I 'd like you to come down to the precinct and dictate what you saw this morning outside the building . You 're the closest thing we 've got to an eyewitness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as on paper . There 's nothing about what I 'm saying other than a request for help in our investigation of the death of Hektor Stefanopolis . You do n't need to be thinking about a lawyer or anything . "  | Tony looked at Ike . " Would you be thinking of a lawyer , Ike , if you were me ? " I wondered if this was one more comment on my I.Q. , the fact that Tony turned to Ike , not to me . " NASA 's got a legal arm , Tony , " Ike said . " Why do n't you put the question to them ? I 'd hate to give you bad advice . " " Oh , great , " Fillingeri said . " Government lawyers , First Amendment protections , friends in the media . Maybe even the Justice Department , with NASA involved . And you have the nerve to talk to me about policy . Policy ! You guys make the NYPD look as simple as Old MacDonald 's Farm . " Before I could open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for , Fillingeri snapped his fingers in my face . " Do n't say it , Abagnarro . " I did n't flinch . " You have fast reflexes , Captain . " I stood up so I could look Fillingeri in the eye . " You know what the odd thing is ? You and I are on the same side . Cops and journalists . I want you to catch Hektor 's killer . You want you to catch Hektor 's killer . " I looked around the room . " I ca n't speak for Ike and Tony , but I 'll bet most of America wants you to catch Hektor 's killer . We like law and order . Even when it comes to us personally . Especially when it comes to us personally . Why you go ape-shit whenever anybody but you knows some law , that 's beyond me . What do you expect from us ? The working press understood Miranda and had it memorized before the cops got the word that the Supreme Court still liked the Constitution . As a matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first heard about Miranda on a television set at the precinct house . " Ike 's cheeks were glowing . " Bravo , Abby . " Fillingeri 's cheeks were touched with pink , too , but his were n't pretty . " I never heard you say so many sentences in a row , Abag-narro . " " Forget it . " I was n't about to touch my cheeks to take my temperature . " It 's the amnesia talking . " Fillingeri did n't try to fathom that one . He just stood there stiffly for a minute . He made an But  | you 're not being charged with anything . So , technically speaking , I was n't going anywhere near your rights . " We left them in the Green Room , not precisely in a staring contest , but close to it . " Hey , Abby , " I heard , when Ike and I 'd gone a few paces down the Tube . I turned back to see Tony leaning out the door of the Green Room . " Can I leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his hand . I retraced my steps and took the box from him . " I 'll lock it up in Ike 's office . " " Take care of it , Abby . " " I will . " Ike and I headed again for Fred Loring 's Magic Improved-Reality Factory over in Graphic Arts . The Tube was crowded , with the usual traffic indicating that Evening Watch had set its preliminary lineup in motion and that show production was on its legs . The uncharacteristic amity between my ex-wife and me drew a few raised eyebrows , and probably spurred some gambling among the currently-out-of-favor producers who had time on their hands to gossip because Tom Hitt was n't letting them work on pieces for the show , but we sailed serenely through the crowd , speaking of neutral topics like hot weather and glassblowing . But , when we reached the hushed regions surrounding Graphic Arts , a neighborhood largely avoided by normal people because of the nerds who work there , Ike stopped me by touching my wrist . " I wish I knew the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said , searching my eyes with her eerie gaze . " Yeah . Me , too . " Caught in the glow of her eyes and nearly overwhelmed by the cathedral silence of the Graphic Arts Zone , it was hard for me to think about Tony Jones , or Dennis Fillingeri , or anything but how close Ike was standing to me . Floating at the back of my mind , like the remnants of a dream from which I was awakening to the greater reality of Ike 's nearness , Tony 's account of his stroll outside the building was receding , so much seaweed on the shore of my consciousness . " You know what Tony 's like , " she whispered . " Are you thinking what I 'm thinking ? " " Probably not , " I said softly , thinking how I 'd like to slide my fingers through the soft blond curls at her temples , to rest my  | thumb along her cheekbone , to feel the weight of her head as she leaned back against my hand , to .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , " regularly use marijuana . " The reason Tony had given Fillingeri , and maybe the security guard , for leaving the building had not washed with Ike or me , not even for a second . Tony Jones did n't smoke ordinary cigarettes . Pot , yes . Tobacco , no . Not that he would have done dope before the show . But there 's always later . Perhaps Tony had wandered down to Columbus Circle to score some herb off of Hektor . The silence in Graphic Arts is underscored by the constant white noise of their clean air machines , placed inconveniently on the floor in the halls and doorways like giant metal hassocks in The - House - Where - the - Interior - Decorator - Has - His - Own - Ideas - About-Reality . Everyone stubs their toes on the air cleaners , except the GA geeks . Maybe the idea is to filter our shoe dirt as well as our germs and filthy auras and whatever else those hungry , low-lying monsters are sucking off all those who dare to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it looks , and they 're meant to trip in-vaders  --  the outer defensive rim against the infidel computer out-siders . The animation freaks are very touchy about their computers in GA , and I often think that , if they could come up with a machine that would screen out unnecessary humans as efficiently as their Honeywell Enviracaires screen out dust particles and pollen , they 'd probably break out into a tea party . I ca n't imagine a celebration among these seasoned loners running to more excitement than a few breathless remarks appreciating the delicate teacups someone brought from his grandmother 's house . You wo n't encounter any-  | thing as festive as champagne corks popping in this region . I can hear the whining now : " Geez , guys , do n't hurt the computers with those missiles . " Fred Loring was sitting dreamily in front of his terminal when Ike and I sneaked up and leaned over the half-wall of his cubby . On his display screen was a glowing electric-green skeleton topped with the head of Diane Sawyer , but Fred had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouse a couple of times and the skeleton executed a little jig from the knee bones down . " What 's that supposed to be ? " Ike said . Fred jumped like a scorpion had nipped his duff . His fingers raced over the fancy keyboard , and the image disappeared into blue storage : some quiet zone , deep in the computer 's gut , where Fred hides his life . " Do n't you get it , Ike ? " I said . " It 's Fred 's version of Prime Time Live . " Fred spun around in his chair . " Abby , " he breathed , gazing at me with a mixture of awe and suspicion , obviously half expecting I had the secret decoder book in my back pocket . " You got it . " " Shucks , Fred . Did n't I tell you that TV directors know the oddest things ? " " Yes , but I never thought you 'd understand symbolic art . " " Anything that does n't require an I.Q. over sixteen is perfect for me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fred 's narrow shoulders slumped . He sighed . He bowed his head , apparently studying his lap . He may even have counted to ten , or run through the signs of the zodiac . When he finally looked up , he gave me the kind of look Dan Quayle probably gives his television set whenever he sees a Sprint commercial . " Abby , I do n't know why I keep having this nagging feeling that there is some substance beneath your shallow facade . Coining all these insults about me has to be chipping away at your moral cen-ter . " " I 'll start taking vitamins . " Ike reached over the wall of the cubby and patted Fred on the shoulder . " You should just ignore what Abby says . I mean , ignore the parts that do n't involve show production . That 's what I try to do . "  | Now that Fred and Ike were linked by a common bond , the shared experience of writing me off , Fred seemed to cheer up . The red-letter fact that Ike had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constructions on the video screen where he worked out the details of his fantasy existence . And , more to the point , he was now inclined to grant the favor we had come to ask . Ike patted him again for good measure . " Fred , " she said , " I need another map , like the ones you did this morning of Central Park and the alley where the doctor died . " Fred looked at his watch , a piece of equipment almost big enough to microwave a hotdog . " We 've got sixteen , seventeen hours before the next show . Ask me later . " Okay , maybe he was n't inclined to do us a favor . " Fred , " Ike said , her Missouri twanginess sharpened , probably on purpose , " I 'm not asking you and I do n't want it later . If I do n't see a map up on that screen within five minutes , I 'm going to kick your computer through the closest air cleaner . We 'll see how all your little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all right , " he whined , turning back to his terminal . " They 're all backed up on disk anyway , so you 're not half as annoying as you think . You do n't know the first thing about computers . What kind of map do you want ? " " I want you to build a map defined by the locations where each of the ten Yellow-Man victims was found . " " Do you have all the locations ? " " Right here , " she said . I heard a crackling noise as she stuck her hand in a silk pocket . She unfolded a piece of NTB letterhead and passed it over the wall . The paper was covered with the geometry of her handwriting  --  the letters made out of triangles and circles and squares . When she was a little girl in school , she must have used math class to write notes to her boyfriends . Fred scanned the list . I looked over his shoulder . I could see that Ike had constructed the list in her typical well-organized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geography class , with the northernmost site coming first on the list . Maybe Ike had paid attention when the teacher got the maps out . " This will only take a minute , " Fred said . He 's even faster on the keyboard than Ike , although much gent-  | ler , and he called up and then dumped several stock maps of Manhattan before choosing the one he liked . I do n't know how he made that decision , because he did it too fast for my eye to keep up with the maps . The one he settled on was rich in detail , so maybe that was it . Bobbing his head between Ike 's list and his monitor , and squeezing the mouse with rapid flourishes of his thin wrist while windows opened and closed on the screen , Fred started putting up little hollow red stars on the map . He gets a lot of exercise when he uses his mouse ; he claims that 's why he has resisted the introduction of trackballs into his department . Above his computer , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that says REAL MEN HAVE MOUSECONTROL . When the sign first went up , I swear I thought Fred had gotten it off an exterminator . When Fred had ten stars , he moved the cursor to the north edge of the map and pumped the mouse again , and again , and again , squeezing off the unused territory and dumping it out of the picture . The map kept getting smaller . The blue background was soon much larger than the bit of map he had left in the middle of the screen , digitally whittled down to a scrap of the island . With a final flip of his wrist , he gave some command that caused the remnant of map to explode , to fill the screen . The whole process had taken him less than three minutes . " You want to give this thing a slug ? " he asked . Ike was blinking at the screen . " Call it Plan B. ' And print it . " She seemed to be chewing the inside of her cheek as she gazed at Fred 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you label the red stars with numbers , like a superscript or something , if I tell you the num-bers ? " " Sure . " He handed her the list . " Do you have a pen ? " Fred looked helplessly around his cubby . Now , there 's a television irony , I thought . Graphic Arts is the last department where you 'd be likely to find a pen . I gave Ike a ballpoint I had filched from the control room , and she started marking up her list of addresses . When she was finished , she read numbers off to Fred and he put them up beside the red stars .  | Nine of the stars , including the one with the superscript number ten ( for Hektor Stefanopolis ) , were clustered on the West Side , north from Times Square to Lincoln Center , east from the Hudson into Central Park . The lonesome straggling star , representing victim number three , was down on Twenty-eighth Street . The map was top-heavy with red stars . " Hmm . I wonder if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaning over into the cubby to point . " If you overlook that one , Fred , is there a what-do-you-call-it ? You know what I mean ? An epicenter ? A geographic center ? The exact middle . " Fred 's fingers did a fast waltz over the keyboard . He called up a grid and superimposed it over the map . He hit a rapid series of keys and , plunk , there was a blue circle on Fifty-seventh Street , between Tenth and Eleventh Avenues . " The south side of Fifty-seventh , " Fred said , just being nerdily precise . I laughed out loud . " That whole block is the CBS Broadcast Center , you dope , " I said . " You did that on purpose . " " No , I did n't . What I did is pure baby mathematics , nothing creative at all . That circle is the middle . All I did was give the program the pattern , which it digitized and then spun out onto the grid as a graphic . " " Well , well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got Dan Rather by the scruff of his neck . Golly , gee . I 'll just take this evidence over to CBS World Headquarters and make him confess . Dan 'll be singing about Yellow-Man like he was covering the latest hurricane . This map was sure a brilliant idea . " She rested her elbow on the half-wall and looked disgusted . " Just for giggles , where would the center be if you included the victim on Twenty-eighth ? Maybe that 's not an ab-erration . " Fred performed some tricks with his machine and another blue circle went up on the screen , on Fiftieth between Eighth and Ninth Avenues . That block is full of French restaurants across from Worldwide Plaza , that giant office/apartment complex designed to lure the affluent to the west side of the island . With its three-story glass pyramid lit at night , that building gets high marks from me . I 've been its biggest fan since it erupted onto Manhattan 's skyline .  | It 's a scene stealer among the veterans . But I could n't imagine what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the French restau-rants . " Can you print that out for me ? " Ike said . " I 'll print it , but I 'll also E-mail it to your queue , if you want . You wo n't be able to manipulate it without my programming , and your keyboard is pathetically Cro-Magnon , but at least you can look at the map on your screen . The color will be better than the hard copy . " Fred gave Ike a wise , compassionate look . " A pixel is worth a thousand pages . " " Thanks . I 'll write that down when I get to my office . " While Fred got his printer set , I moved closer to Ike and said , " Do n't you imagine Fillingeri has done something like this , too ? " " Probably . " She smiled . " But I bet we 've got better color . " " That 's a comfort . " Fred pulled the map off his printer 's chute and gave it a critical glance . He handed it to Ike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we started to walk away . Fred 's thin voice reached out to us across the steady hum of the air purifiers . " Of course , " he said , " both of those blue dots for the geographic center are very unstable . If you want me to update them after the next killing , just send me a note in the E-mail and I 'll whiz a correction back to you . That way you wo n't have to come over here . " The next killing . The words seemed to hang in the clean , clean air of Graphic Arts . Ten had seemed such a complete number , an ordered set , and the death of Hektor Stefanopolis had rounded off the drama of the series of murders with a flourish , so I had n't given a thought to what was next on the killer 's agenda , if anything . Assuming there was anything as coherent as an agenda . Assuming Fillingeri was correct that the Yellow-Man perpetrator was a killer and not some weirdo prankster who expressed himself artistically on accidentally encountered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all seemed to turn up in roughly the same neighborhood of Manhattan . We came around the Tube far enough that Fred 's department had disappeared around the curve of the wall . I turned , stepped back a few paces , and took a peek ; Fred had the green skeleton up  | on the map and was making those bones boogie to some rhythm a different drummer was banging out in his head . I caught up with Ike . " Does it ever strike you , " I said , " that Fred 's a little strange ? " " Lost in space , blasted out of stable orbit before he reached adolescence . But when I need good art in a hurry , I 'd rather have a brilliant fruitcake like Fred than twelve sane people who can construct nice pictures . Fred 's a genius . Of course , it takes the show 's other genius to tell him what to do . Without you , Abby , he 'd be sitting in there , breathing clean air and drawing computer riddles all night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a genius . I wish Captain Fillingeri was here . I wish Tom Hitt was here . I wish the Peabody Committee was here . " " Do n't get the idea that I 'm trying to flatter you . I just know what 's going on . You and Fred are the only ones on the show who know anything about TV . The rest of us are just reporters , of one sort or another . Without you and Fred , Morning Watch would be a newspaper . ? " Well , little girl , since you 're the only one today who has not taken potshots at my I.Q. , I 'm going to share a little secret with you . " Is this going to be one of your stories ? Please , Abby , do n't do this to me . " " Nope . Not a story . What our Boston criminologist would call artifactual evidence . ' " I patted my shirt pocket . " Right here next to my heart is a little thing Tom Hitt would get down on his tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I stopped . A couple of people passed us , two aimless , idle Evening Watch producers wandering in outer darkness until somebody different pissed Tom off and they got to go back to work . " What are you talking about ? " she said . " You wan na find Tex ? " " You know I do . " " You wan na beat Evening Watch to him ? " " You know I do . " " Are you cynical enough to wish our show a rating point or two for more First Amendment crapola ? Wan na show up the so-called competition ? "  | " Of course . What 's in your pocket , Abby ? Did Tex give you his address ? " " I doubt he has an address . " She reached for my pocket and I batted her hand gently away . " Do n't touch , " I said . " I have something here that 's more fragile than an address . " " What is it ? " " Unless I imagined the whole thing  --  in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of fingerprints . " " What ? " " I 've got four of my business cards in my pocket , including the one I tried to give to Tex . " I leaned my shoulders against the wall , spread my hands out , palms up , completely innocent , nothing up my sleeve , ladies and gentlemen . " He gave it back , Ike . Tucked it into my pocket with his own hands . " " Oh , my God , " she squeaked . " This is awesome . " Her excitement did not last . I watched her thinking it over as she stood there , tapping her foot lightly on the linoleum . I could see the eagerness fade from her face . " Well , I guess it 's awesome , " she said . " I mean , it 's great . But how the hell can we do anything with a fingerprint ? We do n't have access to all that crime scene junk and Dragnet BS that Fillingeri uses to track down the bad guys . What are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you looking so smug about ? " " I finally know why God made me taller than Tom Hitt . My brain maybe smaller than Tom 's , but mine 's higher off the ground . My brain 's working off purer ozone . " " What are you talking about ? " " I know where there 's a jukebox . " " Come again ? " " A jukebox . A machine that spins platters . The platters are disks , as in computer disks . And on those disks are millions of fingerprints . Digitized , as Fred would say . " " Did n't The New York Times have something about this a few months ago ? " " Yes . So did our own documentary unit . We only made a reference in passing to the jukebox , because the show concentrated on overseas efforts to locate American MIAs . But I learned something about the technology we have here in the States . The techno-glitz is  | not yet generally available to law enforcement nationwide , because it 's mega-expensive , but some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cards . I wish we had it down in our lobby . " " We do n't . " " Ah . But I know where there is one , and it 's loaded with pictures of fingerprints , just like you 'd see on the shiny paper if you were arrested and they 'd dipped your fingers in ink . Only the jukebox 's pictures of fingerprints have been digitized , turned into binary form , a series of zeroes and ones . And the jukebox will play the tune you request when you insert your quarter . " I admit I paused for effect and patted my chest again . Too bad I did n't have a wand to wave . " Abracadabra . Your quarter , Ike , is in my pocket on my business card . " " How many songs can this jukebox play ? " " About sixty-two million . And I 'm betting Tex is one of those songs , because a lot of these tunes come equipped with criminal records , if you 'll pardon the pun . " " Where is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave me a funny look . " That 's the FBI . " " You 've been studying your law enforcement geography . " " You think they 'd let us play their jukebox ? " A smile was starting to flirt with the corners of her mouth . " Like , a mutual exchange of deep background ? Like off-the-record shinola in return for some trust down the road ? Like , do you happen to have a source , Abby ? Come on , I 'm running out of speculation . " " Morris Cainstraight . I met him when I was directing that documentary on America 's MIAs . That was before the Vietnam Legacy documentary . A man of many talents , your ex-husband , or at least of many documentaries . Othello Armitage just ca n't resist spreading me around the network . So , if you think of it , my enormous salary is not all that ludicrous . " I paused and gave that some genuine thought . " No , it 's still ludicrous . Directors have it made in the shade . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't get me started . Who 's Morris Cainstraight ? " " He 's one of the pioneers of the jukebox technology . He helped develop the software , and he was instrumental in the planning of the print-lifter scanner . That 's the handheld device , a version of a  | supermarket scanner , really , that picks up fingerprints . Cops wo n't even have to get anyone 's fingers dirty once the technology is widespread , meaning when it gets cheaper . They 'll have this Big Brother shit in their patrol cars . " " You mean , if I was driving around and got stopped , the cops could just grab my hand , read my prints , and  --  whammo  --  know who I am ? " " If your prints are in the jukebox . " " Wow . I wonder what Thomas Jefferson would think of that . " " My guess is he would not be happy when all computers are created equal and digitizing our inalienable rights . " Ike was rubbing her chin thoughtfully . " Cops driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Ah , but what if the highway is used to catch the guy who was driving around in the car he stole from you ? " " I bet the ACLU has an eagle eye on this . There will simply be no time for the presumption of innocence . " " No doubt . But that does n't change the fact that you 'd give a lot to have a name and address to attach to the dirty smudges on my business cards . Yes ? " " Well , yeah . Tex is numero uno on our wish list . I would n't dream of letting my constitutional scruples get in the way of a scoop . I figure every scoop is another brick in the wall anyway when it comes to defending that document . " " I 'll call Morris right now , see if he can do lunch with us . " She used her fingers to make a little cup for her chin , and she got that look in her eyes that told me something unpleasant was coming . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she does n't cloak the inventory of her emotions . It 's all there on her face . In your face . Now it 's one of the things I dislike about not being married to her . " I 've already made plans for lunch , Abby . " " So ? Change them . " " I ca n't . This is business . As a matter of fact , it could be another brick in the wall . " " Should I guess ? That fascinating healer who 's trying to turn himself into the towering inferno ? Where 're you going , the Texaco station ? "  | " Aristotle has very kindly consented to let me offer my condolences , that 's all . You should have a little more humanity , Abby . He 's not only very sad , he 's a news source , and I 'm just going to do what I can to help , on behalf of the network . Othello has already signed off on this . " " Because he thinks you 're pumping Aristotle , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes . " " That means Othello 's paying ? Condolence on the company ? " " What difference does it make to you ? " " It makes a big difference . I do n't see why you should eat anything Aristotle buys . If Othello Armitage is paying , that 's not so bad . Where are you going ? " " Gabriel 's . " " Gabriel 's ! The hottest cafe on the West Side , for a condolence visit ? " " What do you expect ? You think Aristotle should be on his knees in the family crypt , absolutely dripping with black armbands ? " " Yes . " " Well , I do n't . " She started walking along the Tube toward her office . " That 's Dark Ages stuff . " I pushed myself off the wall and followed her . " So , " I said , " life goes on for Doctor Death , huh ? " " Just as it should . I wish you would n't call him that . " " Excuse me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " What 's that supposed to mean ? " " Rubin says Aristotle was doing unto Dr. Olivia Quintinale , fellow author and former sister-in-law . Hektor 's ex-wife , if I 'm being too technical for you . Let me spell this out : Aristotle and his brother 's wife were doing it . " She stopped dead in her tracks . " That 's very odd , " she said , cocking her head to one side and looking thoughtfully into the middle distance , the last reaction I would have expected . I was expecting something more heated . " Abby , Rubin mentioned something about that to me , but I do n't like to hear unnecessarily about marital hanky-panky , as you of all people should know . "  | I winced . " Bull's-eye , Ike . " " I wonder . Hektor may have had a motive for killing Aristotle , yes ? " " Maybe . If my brother was screwing you , I 'd be ticked off . " " And Tony may have had a motive for killing Aristotle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Tony 's mind does n't work that way . " " Say it does for the sake of argument . " " All right . " " So that 's two people with motives for killing Aristotle . Plus , Tony said Aristotle was arguing with Quintinale when they got in the cab . And she certainly did n't like it when Aristotle gave me his phone number and was obviously working up to something with me . So maybe she also felt like killing Aristotle . " " This is all if you believe gossip . And we do n't know how mad she was at Aristotle . " " For the sake of argument , say she was mad as hell . " " Okay . So ? " " So . Do you believe that Hektor fits the Yellow-Man pattern ? Or do you believe a copycat capitalized on that pattern to get Hektor ? " " I guess I think it was a copycat . " " According to our own producer and reporter , that 's also what the cops think . It 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember his name ? " " Henry Amos Jankowski . " " Yeah . Him . And if they 're all correct about a copycat , that means there has to be a motive , like a motive we could understand , not something stratospherically insane like a serial killer . And we know of at least three people with decent motives to kill Aristotle , all of whom were handy this morning . " " What 's your point ? " " Why was Hektor the one who got killed ? "  | Unless somebody 's bombing the World Trade Center or dropping a 747 unexpectedly , Monday 's usually the busiest time on the twenty-seventh floor of the Emerald City . The normal flow of news-making events tends to follow the course of the American bureaucratic river  --  that nine-to-five , Monday-to-Friday schedule that empties into the major networks ' evening news programs . Funny how that works . It 's one of those chicken-or-the-egg deals . This particular Monday was a little above par even for a Monday , because the Yellow-Man Whatever was adding his unpredictable workday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system , the medical community , the military/industrial complex , Our Nation 's Schools , and drug cartels ( the drug dignitaries , that is , work nine-to-five ; the entry-level positions are a different matter ) . When Ike and I left the silent Graphic Arts region behind , the twenty-seventh floor Tube was bustling in response to the floodgates opening after the weekend , and I did notice an extra kick-step or two among Tom Hitt 's workhorses . I can usually tell when he 's slapping the reins by the way his cattle giddy-up in the Tube . Tom likes to keep his office door open so he can monitor the pacesetters in the Tube . But his door was closed when we passed by , an unusual circumstance and a definite clue that he was either in deep conference or upstairs tattling on me to the boss . Tom had never really tried to pry my mouth open before , so I did n't blame him if he was rooting around for the right tool . What I did think was that Othello would tell Tom to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't come any more upper than Othello Ar-mitage  --  does not like to have its directors hassled by the editorial side . The reasoning is very simple : Othello , if he got the steam up and chose to do so , could come downstairs from his marble pent-  | house office and do Tom 's job for the day , but he could n't step in and do mine . As we walked along the crowded Tube , weaving through the stampede , I thought about why Dr. Hektor Stefanopolis , who struck me as a nice guy , had gotten it in that alley , instead of some other New Yorker  --  instead of , say , his brother Aristotle . Aristotle seemed much more killable , from my point of view , a man with some habits that could lead to the acquisition of personal enemies . I 'd only known him something like seven hours , and already I did n't like him . When we got to Ike 's office , she said , " If you can set something up for later with Morris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or voice mail or machine at home . Oh , I 'll also take my cell phone along , so , if you need me for something urgent , you can reach me that way . " " What if I just want to ask what you 're having for dessert ? " " Write me a letter . " " I ca n't afford a stamp . I 'm a mugging victim , you know . " " Well , that may turn out to be far more useful than a stamp . If Morris Cainstraight can really help us , the needle in our haystack might take on some sparkle . " " Ike , about Hektor . Are you suggesting his death was a mistake ? That the wrong brother got it ? " " Oh , I was just thinking out loud . But I 'm also acting out loud : I 've got a producer and a crew standing by at Midtown North for the autopsy report on Hektor . Nothing 's going to get by me while I condole with Aristotle . Let me know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Have a nice lunch , Abby . Have a nice lunch . Swell . She was treating me just the way she treated Fred . Pat me when it suits her ; snap at me when I 'm in her way . In fact , now that I thought of it , Ike herself had linked me with Fred  --  the show 's two geniuses , the difference being that he had a green skeleton on a computer screen and I had the ghost of a relationship in my heart . Just me , the genius director , and Fred , the genius cybernaut , in the Emerald City : the Lonely Boys grateful for a pat on the head instead of a kick in the teeth . Or , at least , I was grateful . Fred seemed to  | have gone well past the point where he could feel anything as human as gratitude . I was actually wondering if I could still feel anything when it hit me that I was hurt . Hurt by the businesslike way Ike had walked away from my prized fingerprint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michelin Medico . I did n't by any means care to dazzle Tom Hitt , but he probably would have dropped everything for a crack at the business cards I had in my shirt pocket . I could have roped him in instantly , but I had n't even made a dent in Ike 's social calendar , which had been pretty full since the divorce , if you asked me . I opened the door to my office ( now just a piece of unsecured wood until I could get resupplied with a key ) and stood for a moment holding the steel NASA box . There was no way I would go crawling back to Ike 's office to lock the thing up as I 'd promised Tony , absolutely no way I was going to give her a chance to tell me more things about lunch . Although I was temporarily indisposed through the loss of my office door key , I was n't helpless . I could even have a private audience with the NASA doodad , a privilege not available to every citizen of the republic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing the honorable thing , curbing my curiosity , and locking the box in my desk without first checking out NASA 's bauble-du-jour . On the other hand , I thought , curiosity-control among broadcasters is like a space heater at the North Pole  --  sure , it 'd be nice to have one , but where are you going to plug it in ? You got ta be wired right to produce the desired effect . My wiring told me to open the thing and see if Tony had unloaded his treasure on me because that was better than letting Fillingeri get his hands on the kind of contraband that makes cops look at you funny . I put the box on the corner of my desk . I lifted the lid . And there was another box inside , a clear plastic cube with a little , fat , pink velvet cushion inside . And resting deep in the softness of the cushion was the prettiest golf ball I 'd ever seen . That 's all there was in the steel box . Positively no sign of anything you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to smoke your way to outer space . If Tony had left the building before Morn-  | ing Watch to arrange a transfer of herbal medicine from Hektor to himself , he had either struck out or had been dumb enough to take the shit with him to Midtown North in the company of Captain Dennis Fillingeri , which would be pretty clueless for a rocket scien-tist . I lifted the plastic box out of the steel box and held it up to the dirty gray light struggling in through my slit of a window . The little ball was the smoothest thing I 'd ever seen , shockingly smooth even to someone like me who 'd read the glowing scientific particulars in the show packet . The little sphere 's outer skin was a pearly gray from the superconducting niobium , the inner sphere pure quartz , the whole gadget the most perfectly round object ever made by man . Or maybe by any being . The ball was so perfectly round and smooth that if it was blown up to the size of the Earth , the highest pimple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high . NASA 's Spinning Quartz Ball , as I knew from the show packet , was a gyroscope , or part of one . Four of these little pearly balls were slated to ride the big fire into orbit . And their trip into space had been delayed several times , along with other NASA forays , by congressional budget cutbacks . Even the projected launch date of 1999 was what NASA calls " under review " ? a euphemism for " maybe never , but cross your fingers . " What passions these delays stirred in NASA 's blood , I did n't know . But I did know that if I 'd spent a decade or so of my life trying to send a ball up into space and a colleague had gone and blabbed that my project was " badly prioritized " in the face of Earthside problems , I 'd be inclined to hurt that colleague  --  even if Aristotle Stefanopolis did not need my help getting hurt , what with his high-speed habit of sending himself into orbit around raceway infields . I was afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If this little gizmo was so perfectly round , its structure machined and engineered and precision-polished and dreamed about and pondered over and babied by the best scientific minds in the country , at a total cost of around a million dollars , it might be a serious faux pas to mess it up with my grubby mitts . But I wanted to touch it , to touch something guaranteed to be the smoothest surface ever known to man .  | I 'm happy to be able to report in all honesty that I put the plastic box back inside the steel box without violating the sanctity of the Spinning Quartz Ball . When they finally sent it rocketing up for its two-year date with a polar orbit , I thought , it would go without having been sullied by a television director in the Big Dirty City . And the ball would levitate cleanly in its electrical field , spinning at 170 cycles per second , without once having known the warmth of my hand . And while it spun there in outer space , scientists back on this planet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain tiny angle of sight : forty-four times the angle of view a person would have of a single human hair placed ten miles away , which is the tiniest angle I can think of , and even multiplied forty-four times , still so tiny as to be almost unmeasurable . Forty-four times almost nothing is still almost nothing . And if that little ball  --  which would spin in the utter cold of outer space , never once having known what it was like to lie in the palm of my hand , to roll across my lifeline or heartline  --  did drift by that certain tiny angle , then part of Einstein 's theory of general relativity would be proved . An answer worth billions of dollars ? Aristotle , apparently , had thought not . But , as I closed the steel box over the plastic box , a vision of the Spinning Quartz Ball stayed with me for a moment , a vision trailing across the retina , a vision of a plain certainty for once in this fucked-up universe , and I knew how I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my big desk drawer on the shelf under my dusty Emmy , so I did n't have to call security to help me stash the little golf ball that was waiting for the ride of a lifetime into space and scientific history if NASA could manage to hang on to its dwindling funds . As I got the key down , I wondered how badly mugged Tony and the project team on Gravity Probe B had felt by Aristotle 's congressional testimony . I locked the steel box away and gazed at the clutter on my desk , so unlike the virginal territory of Fred Loring 's cyberspace playpen , so similar in loneliness to the space he had carved for himself out of NTB News . Unless I wanted to turn into Fred , if it was n't already too late , I had to break out of the self-pity that had been creeping over me , maybe inspired by envy of the little ball that was going places while I seemed to be going nowhere .  | At least I could go downtown with my fingerprint collection . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grieving brother of the murdered doctor , but I did n't see any reason to hang around until she was ready to go make astounding discoveries in the jukebox . I flipped through my Rolodex and came up with the number for Morris Cainstraight . I had to go through several government flunkies , all of whom were on the alert for criminal tones in my voice , before I was permitted to speak with the man himself . He had just started his shift and said he 'd be happy to entertain a couple of network snoops when his shift ended that night , anytime after 8:30 . So maybe I was n't going anywhere , at least not right away . I called Ike 's voice mail and told her about our appointment . I gave my Rolodex a vicious spin , watching the high-speed version of my social world twirl around on the desk . Here I was , with a torrid clue in my shirt pocket and nobody to share it with . I thought of Tom Hitt 's closed door , and it was some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of learning my mugger 's identity , Tom was even worse off , having no clue about my clue . I got out the show packet for the glassblowing segment and looked at the last page for the press contact number , which was listed as the Physics Department at Columbia University . Maybe Hilda Murray would let me give her the third degree about the interpersonal warfare I 'd seen brewing in the Green Room before the show . Maybe she had some insights I could add to the single big one I was hiding from Tom Hitt . Maybe she 'd go to lunch with the Lonely Boy . When I reached the Physics Department , I asked for a glass-blower . " We have seven glassblowers , " said a tired male voice . " Which one do you want ? " " Hilda Murray . " " Hold on while I connect you . " Seven glassblowers , I thought . At one university . Who 'd have thought there 'd be such demand for the ancient craft ? " Hello , this is Hilda . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear a little chuckle at her end of the line . " Hungry . Are you about to ask me to lunch ? "  | " How 'd you know ? " " You had that lunch look in your eye this morning . " There was a pause . " That was before the murder , of course . " " Yeah . " " Yeah . A couple of police officers have been up here at the lab asking what I know . The urge to gossip suddenly dried up on me . I found myself having trouble sorting out what I 'd heard this morning from what I 'd seen for myself . So I basically told them nothing . But there was nothing . I ca n't get over it . " " Eating 's always a good thing to do when you 've got something to get over . Food does n't help you get over it , but at least you 've got something to do with your hands . You want to come down to my neighborhood , or would you rather do something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'll meet you down there , " she said . " Do you know Gypsy 's ? " " Are you kidding ? My middle name is penne alla vodka . " She made a few noises about the weather turning ugly , which I could tell by the way my window slit had turned to a black hole . We agreed to meet inside Gypsy 's at one o'clock . I toyed briefly with the idea of borrowing the Spinning Quartz Ball to hynotize Hilda with over lunch , but I did n't know anything about NASA 's insurance coverage . Since I was just baby-sitting , would the network 's insurance cover the thing ? I certainly did n't want the ball to end up in the pocket of some grabber like Tex . The thought of Tex made me unlock the desk drawer again . I took the four business cards from my shirt pocket and put them inside the NASA box , on top of the plastic cube . Two sets of man-made objects , two different things to prove , two separate scales of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name of one guy . I rode down in the elevator with Diego Gordillo , the only Evening Watch producer that Tom Hitt allows to touch his fly-fishing tackle when he vacations out West . I do n't think Diego ever produced anything other than a smoother life for Tom , being sort of an all-purpose gofer and handler . " So , Abby , " he said , pushing the button for the lobby , " I hear you had some problems overnight . " " If you mean Ike , I have problems with her every night . Have n't you guys got anything better to talk about ? Is n't there some press  | conference or riot you could discuss among yourselves quietly ? " " Chill , Abby . I would n't gossip about your personal life . " " Then what the hell do you and Tom talk about ? " " Nothing personal , man . Tom 's just concerned about you getting mugged . Must 've been awful . Were you scared ? I would have embarrassed myself , that ever happened to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , through the giant green glass doors , I could see the epic beginning of the storm our meteorologist had promised . Raindrops were slashing across the glass sideways , the wind was blowing so hard . " Holy Mother of God , " I said . " Look at that . " " S'awesome , man . Mother Nature comes to town . But , just tell me , were you scared last night ? " " Me ? Scared ? Of what ? " " You know , getting mugged . " " Was I mugged ? " Diego lowered his heavy brows and looked at me like he 'd forgotten my name . " What 's the matter with you ? " he said . " Everybody knows you got rolled . " I shook my head sadly . " Last night 's one big blur , Diego . I think I must be suffering from heat exhaustion or something . Do you have a subway token on you ? " He fished around in his change and handed over a token . " Thanks , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only thing I remember about last night is something about a couple of goodlooking hookers . You know the type , the ones that look like royalty ? And something about a gray limo . " I shrugged my shoulders . " Oh , well , I hope I had a good time . Got ta run now . Heavy date with Meryl Streep . Do n't forget to tell Tom the part about Meryl when you report this conversation . " I headed out through the revolving door and took the plunge into The Storm That Ate Manhattan .  | I 'd like to know at what point rain over New York starts getting so dirty it paints the town instead of washing it . Is it that dirty when it leaves the clouds , or does it gather filth power on its way down ? Exactly where ? At the level of the Empire State Building 's observation deck ? Higher ? Lower ? Gradually ? Maybe on its way past the Rainbow Room  --  would n't that be something ? Wherever the dirt threshold is , by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to turn my white shirt not only wet but speckled with soot . What the heat wave had trapped and stacked up over the city was now flowing down the storm drains with the rain , but it filtered through my clothing first . And the water was n't flowing fast enough down the drains . There 'd be classic and picturesque urban flooding for at least some voiced-over videotape on Evening Watch , so Tom could demonstrate that NTB 's New York bias was not limited to heat waves . Columbus Circle was a pool of dirty water , with traffic swirling around and churning up the surface like one of those water rides at Asbury Park . I made myself a quick bet that the New York Post would run a full front-page photo along the lines of what I was seeing in the Circle , only with frolicking kids in its picture , and the fat banner headline would be something like H2000H ! I dashed for the subway , skidding down the stairs into the station . I was only two stops away from the theater district @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diego 's help I would have had to scoot under the turnstile , and it was getting sloppy down there . All in all , I felt that Diego 's subway token was a pretty good return on the investment of lies I had fed him . The downtown local train was packed tight . I had to squeeze between a damp bosom and a pair of soaked shoulder blades , while the sharp point of some umbrella caught me under the rib cage .  | And I could feel a warm and soggy kneecap poking into my calf . When the doors closed , my left arm was stuck against them so tight that the woman with the bosom ( assuming it was a woman ) could have taken a blood sample from me without a tourniquet , if that was the sort of thing she liked to do on subways . At the Forty-second Street , Times Square , Station , the doors opened on the other side of the platform , so I had to wait for a few passengers to peel themselves off each other before I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the car . I stayed underground , walking north toward the Forty-fourth Street exit , to get as close to Gypsy 's as possible before I had to make the dash again through the storm . Lunchtime in Midtown Manhattan during the work week is probably the worst time and place on Earth , even without rain , full of crowds going nowhere but around each other . Nobody 's leaving . In addition to the real New Yorkers , we 've got all these people from the warehouse states like New Jersey and Connecticut where we store some of our working population at night . At lunchtime the commuting element empties out of the buildings and infests the eateries with the rest of us . Rain makes it worse , because soaked New Yorkers are much surlier than nice , dry ones . There was fresh violence in the air . This storm was making the citizens fight back , with arms and elbows and newspapers , and umbrellas turned inside out . It was a fast and passionate storm , and it pummeled the city like an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on points . By the time I made it to the restaurant , I was soaked and sore , but pleasantly hungry . The one thing rain never washes away from the city is the smell of food  --  the unquenchable mixed blessing of enough garlic , onions , uttapam , and sesame sauce to keep eight million people from starving . The 300 block of Forty-sixth is especially fragrant . It 's known in the theater district as " Restaurant Row " and is home to Gypsy 's , the restaurant my family has owned since 1952 and where all the theater crowd hangs out sooner or later . My parents had befriended just about every struggling actor and actress and producer and playwright and lighting director and choreographer who ever went on to make it in the bigtime , and a lot more who did n't . When my dad died eight years ago , my mother took over the  | business by herself . It 's still Broadway 's home kitchen , but Carole Abagnarro has her own ideas about kitchens , and she 's feeding the crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure levels . She changed more than the menu after dad died , adding a lot of chrome and subdued lighting and chucking the linen tablecloths in favor of drawing paper , but the clientele is roughly the same . People who used to run tabs there when they could n't find work now happily pay her exorbitant prices . Gypsy 's is the kind of place where tourists come to gawk at stars , but they get one look at my mother 's disapproving expression and sit down to eat , minding their manners . Hilda Murray was sitting primly in the booth under the cat clock , a machine with roving yellow eyes and a black-and-white tail that ticks back and forth . The cast of Cats gave the timepiece to my mother . Since it 's black and white , it 's a Jellicle Cat , the kind T. S. Eliot wrote about and won a Tony for , just as though he 'd actually written the libretto for the smash musical . It 's quite a trick , writing anything when you 've been dead for about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before I could even greet the only glassblower I knew , my mother was there with a pile of warm dish towels and a scowl . I knew she was n't scowling because I was wet . She was not pleased with the company I was about to keep . Carole Abagnarro has the idea that this divorce thing is a temporary lull in my marriage to Ike , a condition that will go away as soon as I do the right thing  --  which , of course , is never specified . " You 're lucky I had a table , Abby , " she said , handing me a towel and draping another over my head . " Such a crowd and you did n't even call . This person said she thought you had a reservation . " " This person " made a face like What did I do ? " Yeah , I 'm lucky , Ma . I 'd like you to meet Hilda Murray . She 's a glassblower from Columbia University and ? " " What , do you think my TV 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw her this morning . And I saw that Ike was doing a wonderful job , as usual , by the way Morning Watch beat even CNN on that murder story . Ike is a very fine producer . " " Yes , Ma . " " Ike should win an Emmy for that show . " " She 's already got three , Ma. "  | " Three 's an unlucky number . " My mother cast a speculative look at Hilda . " You think about that , Abby , while I get you menus . " I toweled my hair and grinned at Hilda . She must have found a taxi right outside her door at Columbia or she owned one powerful umbrella . She did n't need a towel . " My mother likes you , " I said . " I can tell . " Hilda leaned across the table and said , " Am I three of something ? When I came in here , there was only one of me . " " That 's just the way my mother counts . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two people , and there you are now in the booth across from me , which is three . " " We could have gone to a different restaurant . " " No way . I have exactly zero money , and I eat free here . So do you . " " We 'll see . I 'll lay you excellent odds that your mother brings me a check . " " A little something written in scarlet ink ? " " Yeah . That 's the spirit . Make fun of me . " I wrapped a dry towel around my neck and reached across the table for her hand . " I 'm sorry . " I turned her hand over to look at the palm and the tips of her fingers . " I ca n't get over what you did to that glass on the show , Must hurt like hell . Does n't it bother you , what you do to your fingers ? " " Sure . But it would bother me more not to do it . I love shaping the glass . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were asking me about a little idea , an idea that your fingers got red because you 've been using too much turpentine to get the yellow paint off . " She gasped and tried to jerk her hand away . " That 's pretty stupid . " " It 's par for the course . Journalists have ugly minds . " " Get your hand awayfrom me ; she 's coming back . " My mother dumped a couple of small menus on the table and continued past , on her way to the bar . " The coast is clear , " I said . " Let 's not bother with the menus . Let 's just order your middle name . " She glared at me . " I hope you told those people what they could do with their idea . "  | " I ignored them . Ignorance is my new policy . " She sat for a moment . I could see her working it out . She smiled , a little reluctantly . " Serves me right , I suppose , to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did some myself this morning . In fact , I think I started it . " " No , you did n't . That was Tony . " Her eyes twinkled . " You 're right . Let 's gossip about him . " The waitress bustled up when she saw we were ignoring the menus . " We 'll both have the penne cilia vodka , " I told her . " And Snapple . " " Weird combination , " Hilda said as the waitress headed for the kitchen . " I 'd have picked you for a Chianti man . " " Usually you 'd be right . But today I 'm working on my I.Q. , and I do n't want to burn off any brain cells with excess alcohol . " " Why are you working on your I.Q. ? Is it broken ? " " That 's what I 'm working on . " " May I ask you a question , a question about those people with ideas and about your work ? Not the I.Q. work . " " Make it an easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain . " " Okay . What 's your obligation now , now that the show 's off the air and the New York police seem to be shaking a leg on Dr. Stefanopolis 's murder ? " " My obligation ? " " Yeah . I mean , do you have to initiate your own investigation , or do you just report what the official investigators say ? " " I do n't do either . That 's Ike 's department . Actually , I 'm sort of lying . Let me put it this way : I 'm not a producer or a reporter . They 're the ones who 'll be doing any investigation NTB News gets involved in . But I 'm part of the show , and I was there this morning , and I think the guy who killed Hektor should be found . When you 're in the control room , as you saw this morning , a story has a way of four-dimensionalizing itself off the screen and into your space . " I thought you did n't know big words . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Why four dimensions ? " " The regular three and time . Working in the control room gives me a thing about time . About being precise , about being first ,  | about being able to work time to my advantage , about using time like a lot of people use , say , depth or distance . Or like the way you use heat . Time 's my medium , much more than videotape . So , even though I 'm not directly involved with anything the show does to investigate a story , I supply some of the urgency . I hope that answers your question . " " I forgot my question . " " Then let me ask you one . This morning in the Green Room . What was that gloom all about ? I thought I 'd walked into a wake . " Two huge steaming platters of Penne Alla Vodka Carole appeared in front of us . I looked up , expecting to see the waitress , and caught instead the glare from my mother 's brown eyes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Abby , " she said . " Do n't dawdle . " " Does she look hungry ? " " She looks the way she always looks . " " Hungry , " I said . " We 'll eat like a couple of pigs . " She nodded at Hilda , like what else would you expect ? She headed toward the bar , probably to order up some free drinks for the standees in the foyer . And maybe some towels . " Back to the Green Room wake , " I said . " Who started it ? " Hilda took a bite of the pasta and rolled her eyes . " This is so good . " She swallowed . Even swallowing she had a nice neck . " I 'm feeling gun shy now about gossip , now that I know how minds work at the network level . " " Remember ? I 'll just ignore everything you say . I 'm safe . " She gave me a considering look . " Okay . I guess I 'd have to blame Aristotle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time , but I understand it now . I heard on CNN that Hektor had glau-coma . " " What 'd Aristotle say ? " " The doctors were talking about the photograph on the back of their book , sort of criticizing each other but nothing too heartfelt , when Aristotle said something like Hektor had no right to an opinion because he could n't see what was right under his nose . " " Yow . Not a nice thing to say to a brother with glaucoma . " " Well , now I think there was more to it than that . I think Aristotle was also referring to what the makeup man said , about Aristotle doing the wild thing with Hektor 's wife . All three are in  | the photograph , you know , looking ever so together and filled with a common purpose . Ironic , I think . As I said , I did n't get it at the time , but in retrospect I 'm fairly appalled . It 's one thing to insult your brother about a disease  --  glaucoma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then Aristotle piled on an additional insult by a sly reference to what an accomplished swordsman he is . " " Swordsman ? " She blushed . " That 's better than expert fuck , ' is n't it ? " I laughed . " They 're both dynamite . You 're pretty good with words . And you 're cute when you blush . " She looked down at her plate . " Now I 'll really blush . Betrayed by my vulgar vocabulary . " She raised her eyes , which were full of fun and speculation . " I 'll have to memorize more graffiti . It seems to work for me . " I laughed again and reached over to pat her hand . I think what I did could have been interpreted as a brotherly gesture , but Carole Abagnarro has her own ideas about gestures and she bore down on us like she was the health inspector and I 'd just pulled a rat out of my shoe . " I hope you enjoyed your meal , " she said with a grim smile . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at acquaintances along the way , carried our half-finished lunches into the kitchen . " That certainly takes the awkwardness out of the question of whether to linger over coffee and cannelloni , does n't it ? " Hilda said brightly . " I 'm not leaving a tip . " " Good . And I 'll steal a towel . " " That 'll teach her . " We left and waded out under the awning of Gypsy 's . There were acres of taxis in sight , but they were all full . " I 'm headed downtown to NYU , " Hilda said , raising her voice to be heard over the honking and the thunder . " How about you ? " " Uptown . To bed . I 'm a night creature , remember , and I have to turn around and do the show again tonight . " She offered me a hand . " Let 's just separate , then . It would be impossible to be graceful in this mess . " I held her hand for a moment . She knew I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , giving me the **26;31;TOOLONG , indicating a kiss would be welcome . I do n't know what came over me . Somewhere between the idea  | and the execution of it , my lips ended up on her forehead . Very chaste . She opened her eyes and looked at me . " Your I.Q. seems pretty healthy , " she said , " but there may be something wrong with your aim . " First my I.Q. and now my aim . I hated to think what would be next . But there was nothing wrong with my eyesight yet , and , as I started out from under the awning , I caught a glimpse of Diego Gordillo in a doorway across Forty-sixth Street . He turned away to look at himself in the window , but not before I recognized Tom Hitt 's favorite slave . Diego was soggy , his clothes stuck to his lean frame , water streaming off his brown hair , and , even turned away from me , he looked like he had cornered the market on misery . By golly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't know how to feel about it . It should have been creepy , but the odd thing was , I got a lift out it . Being followed . Me . A virgin in the for-est  --  I 'd never been followed before . I did n't count my dance with Tex , because , technically , he had n't been following me . He 'd been setting me up . Diego , on the other hand , was a pure tail . I rubbed my wet hands together . I played with the idea of taking him on a guided tour of someplace he did n't want to go  --  like Yonkers  --  but I decided there was no harm in letting him follow me home . Diego would n't learn anything but my address , and Tom already had that much in his direc-tory . Besides , I needed another subway token . I dodged around taxis and leaped puddles , crossing the street to Diego 's side . " Can you lend me another token ? " I asked . He looked puzzled for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | pretend he was n't there , but we were both getting soaked , so he dug a token out of his pants pocket and handed it over . " I 'm taking the IRT to Seventy-second , " I said , " and I 'll walk two blocks north and one west . Now we 're even . " I went home to Seventy-fourth Street and , since I was still keyless , had to rouse the super to let me into my apartment . I tossed my wet clothes into the hamper , brushed my teeth , lifted the shade to look out the window at Diego nine stories down on the street , and went to bed , pleased with the idea that the rain would probably keep up all afternoon and his clothes were n't getting any drier . I pulled the fresh , crisp sheet up to my chin and hoped he was hungry . Being followed was fun , I thought , yawning and snuggling into the pillows . The phone woke me up at 6:45 . More than four hours of sleep . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Ike 's voice said , " I heard you pick up . Say something . " " Something . " " I got your message . You want to meet at FBI headquarters , or do you want to go together ? " " Is it still raining ? " " Let me look . " I could hear some noise from her end of the line , like she was rooting around in her bed ; then I heard what I knew was the blue silk shade behind our former conjugal bed go whapping up , sounding , as it always had , like a newspaper caught in the wind . " Nope , " she said . " I can see clear sky . " " I 'm getting homesick listening to the noises you 're making . What are you wearing ? " " That green teddy you gave ... Abby , mind your own business . Are you taking extra hormone shots or something ? " I.Q. Aim . Hormones . The list was getting long . " I 'm still using up the hormones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " At the rate I 'm going , I 'll have plenty left when I 'm ninety . " " That 's your own fault , Romeo . You should have thought of that when you took your hormones to the Kremlin and betrayed our marriage . " I sat up in bed . " Let 's skate . " " Excuse me ? " " Let 's skate . As in Rollerblade . To Federal Plaza . "  | " Oh . Skate . I thought you said mate . ' You want to skate all that way ? " " Now you 're talking . I 'd love to go all the way with you . " She snorted into the phone . " I 'll be at your place in half an hour . " " No , wait . We 'll have to meet somewhere else . " " Why ? " " Because  --  oh , boy , I ca n't wait to tell you this one ; get ready to laugh  --  Tom Hitt is having me followed . " " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it 's kind of funny . Diego Gordillo . " " I 'm going to tell on him to Othello . Can you lose Diego ? We do n't want company on this errand to the FBI . " " Can I lose Diego ? Jesus , Ike , I 'll be on wheels . " " Ha ! I 'd like to be there to see Diego 's face when you light out . " " Be at the Emerald City instead and I 'll show you my face when I get there . That 's the last place Tom 'll think of looking for me at this hour , just as they get off the air . That 's also where I left the business cards . " " Half an hour ? " " Half an hour . Wear the teddy . " She hung up , not gently . I shaved , showered , and applied a layer of Band-aids to my blistered ankle , the mass of red and bubbled skin that had kept me out of my skates the night before . The Band-aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would do the job . I pulled on a pair of cutoff jeans , stuck a white T-shirt in my waistband , yanked on a pair of socks , snatched my extra set of keys from the desk , scooped some change and a couple of tens off the bureau , and grabbed my skates at the door . On the way down in the elevator , I pulled on the T-shirt and crammed the keys and buying power into my pockets . I went to the lobby door and scanned the street . Diego was leaning against the building , wearing dry clothes . And he was on blades . Tom Hitt must 've sent Diego the reinforcements while I slept . Tom 's no fool , so I figured he 'd picked Diego for a reason , and that reason might be that Diego actually knew how to skate . I wondered if he was any good .  | I parked myself on a bench in the lobby and got equipped for speed . When I pushed open the door , Diego was admiring the clear sky . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door shut behind me . " Very nice . Beats the heat , does n't it ? " " You ready to go ? " " Ready , man . " " You had anything to eat today ? " " Yeah . A nice slice of pizza across the street . " " They do a fine pepperoni over there . " He nodded . " They do . " " You need to go to the bathroom or anything ? " " I 'm fine . " " Then let 's get this over with . It 's going to be a lonely night for you , Diego . " " Maybe . Maybe not . " " I play rough . " " Tom says you 're not as good as you think you are . " " Tom does n't know how good I think I am . " " Whatever . He says it 's all hype . " " You 've been had , amigo . You 're toast . " I rolled out across the sidewalk and over the curb , studying the traffic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once , then took off for Amsterdam Avenue . More pedestrians ( that includes skaters ) are killed on Amsterdam by automobiles than on any other street in Manhattan . As the only Manhattan street listed on the Department of Transportation 's 1992 roster of the city 's ten most dangerous streets , Amsterdam seemed like a logical and appropriate place to take Diego to the races . The rush was behind schedule that evening , very thick for seven o'clock , probably because of the earlier flooding , and the traffic going up Amsterdam was all I could have wished for  --  cars and taxis and bicyclists and Rollerbladers and buses and trucks and one lunatic on a skateboard and a panhandler in a wheelchair , shaking his Styrofoam cup with one hand and pushing his chair against the traffic with his other hand . I threaded my way out into the middle lane and put my legs into it , gathering speed and timing the lights , which is another terrific advantage to playing tag on Amsterdam  | the lights are staggered . I wove in and out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corner of Seventy-ninth , a cruising ambulance suddenly flashed its lights and the siren let out a pulsating wail . I put on a burst of sprint speed and broke into the lane , swerving across the front of the ambulance as it took off , the siren blasting in my ears . The driver gave me the finger , and I tore down the short block of Seventy-ninth that dumps out at the Museum of Natural History and made a right onto Columbus . I circled through the dusky shadows lining the pavement and stopped . No Diego . I took a leisurely tour on the sidewalk around the museum , just to make sure Diego had learned that Tom Hitt was not a good judge of what I think , and headed for the park , going east . It was pleasantly cool in the park , and I was just hitting my stride when I came out on Central Park South and turned right toward Columbus Circle . I could see Ike turning a speed stop in front of the Emerald City . She waited for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed her I.D. , and we signed in . We skated to the elevator together . She pushed the button for twenty-seven . " Where 's Diego ? " she said . " I think he 's on the front bumper of an ambulance . " " Serves him right . " " You look very pretty tonight , my dear , even if I would have preferred the green teddy . " She was wearing cutoffs , too , and one of those workout tops that looks like a bra with wide straps . Her skates were pink , and the tops of her thick white socks were just visible where the pink ended . " Thank you , " she said . " You 're welcome . " I let her go first when the elevator doors opened , and I saw that she had her cell phone stuffed into her tight back pocket . " Very fetching phone you have there , " I said to her backside . " Thank you . " " You 're welcome . " We went straight to my office , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I reached up for the Emmy and the key to my desk , Ike sat down at my keyboard , booted the computer , typed in her password , and read the index of her mail .  | " The autopsy results on Hektor , " she said , pounding the keyboard and switching displays . She read a long memo . " The coroner released the results at three this afternoon . " I waited . She turned around . " Heart failure . Pure and simple . No wounds . No punctures , no bruises . No evidence of poison . The only notable thing about liektor 's blood chemistry is the presence of ' ? she turned back to the monitor to consult the electronic note ? " beta adrenergic blockers . " " That does n't sound good . " " Unless you happen to suffer from glaucoma . They expected to find it in Hektor , and they did . Nothing funny about it . " " Jeez , Ike . I 'd hate to be the medical examiner right now . Fillin-geri 's probably left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did you happen to see a newscast today ? " " Nope . " She fiddled with the keyboard and called up the lineup for Evening Watch . She sat and pouted at the screen , her elbows propped on the corners of the keyboard , her chin in her hands , and I squatted beside the chair to read along with her . " They led with it , of course , " she mumbled , rubbing her chin with her knuckles . " Tom got an exclusive interview with the medical examiner . " She pointed at the first item on the display . " Look at that . They slugged it Unclassified Paint Job . ' Very funny . " She punched keys , switched screens , and produced the full script for the lead story . She read a few lines . " The medical examiner said plenty more nothing . " She started laughing and scanned the last paragraphs of the story . " See that ? They got a sound bite from Fillingeri : ' Hit were n't for the yellow paint and the U.S.S.R. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As it is , for now , the death of Dr. Hektor Stefanopolis is unclassified . ' " " Why are you laughing ? " " Look at Tom 's note at the bottom of the script . " I read it . His note , obviously a lighthearted , private exchange with the correspondent and not meant for broadcast , said , " Captain F. ? New York 's Funkiest unclassifies his own dick : Hey , just because somebody painted it , hung a sign on it , and it does n't work anymore , does n't mean a crime 's been committed . ' ? Hitt. "  | Ike shut off the machine and swiveled toward me in my chair . " Tom is going to try to make sure you do n't shake loose again , Abby . Next thing you know he 'll borrow the traffic helicopter from Channel 5 to keep an eye on you . " Still squatting by the chair , I put my hands on her knees , not amorously , just keeping my balance . " I could always go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subways is a helicopter . Ike , those guys were all murdered . You know it , Tom knows it , Fillingeri knows it , the M.E. knows it . It 's probably driving Fillingeri nuts that he ca n't call it murder . And he ca n't , not until the medical examiner says it 's murder . Fillingeri 's being hung on a technicality , a noose his own department made . I hate to defend him , God knows , but he 's got to be as strung out as he can be without snapping in two . " " I guess . " " It 's more important than ever to find Tex , " I said , pressing her knees with the palms of my hands . " The killer  --  whether it 's Tex or not  --  looks like he 's getting away with it . And I have a feeling Tex has enough of a criminal record to go platinum in Cainstraight 's jukebox . " " Let 's put some serious concrete under our wheels . " I leaned across her knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the NASA box and raised an eyebrow . " You still have this ? " " I have n't heard from Tony . The business cards are in there , and while you 're at it , you might as well feast your eyes on Einstein 's true-or-false test . " She opened the box , and I took the business cards by the corners , slipping them into my T-shirt pocket . She stared down at the plastic cube holding the Spinning Quartz Ball . " It 's rather ordinary , is n't it ? " she said . " How can you say that ? It 's blasphemy . That ball thing is pure music . It makes me want to soar to the planets and know the secrets of the ages . " She gave me a look . " Well , well , are n't you a combination of Buck Rogers and Indiana Jones ? What 's come over you ? " I closed the box , put it back in my drawer , and turned the key in the lock . I rose and replaced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand to her .  | " You are cordially invited to accompany me on a journey into the unknown . Let 's go see the jukebox . " She stood , slipping an inch or so on her skates before she got her balance . " You make it sound like a joyride to Jupiter instead of Rollerblading down Broadway . " " Ditch your disbelief at the door , little girl , and follow me . " She grinned . " Now you sound like the Big Bad Wolf . " I leered at her bosom . " Grandmother will love your space suit . " Traffic was thinning out when we left the Emerald City and began a gentle glide down the Great White Way . I looked around for signs of Tom Hitt 's Junior Spy League , but trying to find one suspicious-looking person among the hundreds of hustlers in that area is like sorting lentils on a fast conveyor belt . I did n't see anyone who worked for Evening Watch , not unless he was dressed as a pimp or a Japanese tourist with theater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed the Ed Sullivan Theater , with its blue-and-yellow marquee featuring David Letterman 's name , Ike pulled out her cell phone and dialed a number with her thumb . " Who are you calling ? " " The Parker Meridien . That 's where we put Tony . " She talked to the phone for a minute or so , returned the phone to her back pocket , and glanced up at the Jumbotron in Times Square . There was a flashy commercial on the giant screen for Columbia Home Videos . " Tony 's not in his room , " she said . " We 'd have heard if he 'd checked out of the Parker Meridien and moved to a suite at Midtown North . He 's probably out playing . " " I 'm not worried about where he is now . I 'm worried about where he 'll be at six o'clock tomorrow morning . Tony and his ball  | thing will probably be our first segment after the news at the top of the show . " " Tony 's a pro . He 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tony wo n't miss the show even if he has to do it in an orange jumpsuit and leg shackles . After all , NASA needs good PR with the American public about as much as I need good PR with you . " She gave me a long , considering look as we glided along . " You do n't have as many accidents as NASA does . " I did n't know how to take that , but my attention was grabbed by a bicyclist trying to cut me off , and I let Ike 's remark go . I gave myself a mental pat on the back for restraining myself with the biker and gave technology a silent salute when I checked all the temperature clocks visible from Times Square and saw that they all agreed : it was eighty-one degrees everywhere within a three-block radius . New York 's a difficult city to get lost in , with signs everywhere , but I call it downright accommodating  --  user friendly , even  --  that we have such a commitment to announcing publicly the weather inside our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how warm it was when all your money got sucked away into the great neon maw of the universe . Once past Times Square and its random obstacles of street vendors and trash and the pre-theater dinner crowds , we were able to pick up our pace . We skated all the way to Fourteenth Street without exchanging a word . We stopped there for a red light , both of us a little winded . The patches of clouds in the sky were pink and orange , and I was nearly blinded when the light changed and the cab beside me peeled out , its side mirror grabbing a piece of the fireball sun riding over the Jersey hills and throwing it back into my face . I stood there blinking rapidly , and Ike was across Fourteenth before I could see again . I groped my way across the street , and there on the corner sidewalk was a wriggling mass of things crawling around . At first I thought it was rats , and then I thought I was seeing things , but eventually I got it worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camel , a tiny yellow chicken clucking and laying tiny white eggs on the sidewalk , a tiny cow mooing and squirting white strings out of her udder , and a plastic rat baring its teeth and lashing its tail and dropping rat raisins . These were just the demos ; the guy selling them was sitting on a couple of cartons , probably piping  | hot off the truck . $9.95 American , and you can take a crapping plastic rat home to your wife and kids in Tokyo , if you 've decided against a replica of the Empire State Building or sunglasses that light up and turn your head into the Statue of Liberty . What the hell  --  why not buy one of each and get the full experience ? I caught up with Ike and gave her hand a quick squeeze . She let me hang on ( which for me was the trip to Jupiter ) , and we sailed together down the island , enjoying a fast workout for twenty blocks or so until we fetched up at the Jacob K. Javits Federal Building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the FBI lives there . I used to think that there ought to be a law that every building in New York should be labeled with a brief and accurate list of contents , but now , since terrorists and semiautomatics have begun to outnumber cabs , I 've changed my mind . Maybe we should paint all the buildings and street signs black and make the scare-artists guess . We 'd keep the temperature clocks and let them know how hot they were , but not where they were . We entered the federal building and skated across to the security **40;59;TOOLONG manning the desk . If he gave me any sass about rules and so on , I planned to keep my mouth shut and obey . He was light-years above Carl Honeyman and the Emerald City 's idea of security . He was carrying two guns that showed , and I did n't even want to speculate on what was n't showing . I gave him our names and our work titles , and Ike showed her NTB News I.D . card , all of which seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say any words with his mouth , and he did n't say anything with his face , and he did n't say anything with his posture . The only way I knew for sure that he was n't a robot was his dandruff . I asked for Morris Cainstraight . The **28;101;TOOLONG type punched what I took to be a security clearance code into the telephone on the desk and picked up the receiver . There was no way I could have made the call myself . Carl Honeyman would die of envy if he saw the setup in this building . " Special Agent Cainstraight will be right down , " the security/ gun/code/scary guy said , " and he 'll escort you upstairs . In the meantime , I 'll have to ask you to hold out your hands for the scanner .  | " Huh ? " I said . He lifted a slim gray device attached by a curly white cord to a computer on the desk . " Fingerprints . " I held out my right hand , palm up . The device grunted five times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Other hand , " he said . I gave him my left , and he repeated the procedure . It was Ike 's turn . " Hold out your hand , miss . " " I 'm not doing that , " she said . " Who do you think you are ? " " I think I 'm FBI , miss , and if you do n't want to be fingerprinted , that 's fine with me . " She flashed me a startled look of triumph . " Well , " she said , " I guess it pays to stick up for your rights . " " The only thing is , " he said , " if you choose not to be scanned , which is your right , you 'll have to wait for your friend here in the lobby while he goes up with Mr. Cainstraight . I 'll be happy to have some coffee supplied for you , and perhaps some magazines to help pass the time . " Ike stuck her hands out toward him . " Thank you , miss . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grunts and red lights passed over Ike 's fingertips . " I promised you a trip to Jupiter , " I told her , smiling . " Welcome aboard . " " Yeah . " She looked at her fingertips . " I 'll never be the same . My fingers have just lost their virginity . " They 're efficient at the Jacob K. Javits Federal Building . Ike had barely gotten started on the inspection of her deflowered fingers when an elevator door opened and Morris Cainstraight stepped out . He was wearing the standard FBI uniform : a dark suit , white shirt , dark tie , square jaw , American Conservative Haircut . No visible distinguishing marks . He shook hands with me , a standard no-nonsense manly shake , and gave Ike the same when I introduced her . He did n't even glance at the parts of her that were on display due to the brevity of her outfit . Aristotle Stefanopolis could benefit , I thought , by a course in FBI manners . We accompanied Morris Cainstraight up to the second floor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offices . The  | quiet was profound , pristine ; it would have turned Fred Loring so green with envy that he would have been a good match for his computer date , the electronic skeleton . Our course led us to an open area unblemished by any natural light . A few people dressed like our escort in FBI uniforms were working at computers or on telephones , but they did n't look at us . I supposed they did n't need to : if Ike and I tried anything funny , t heir lobby scanner already had us . It was a little unnerving to be so casually dressed and on skates in that serious environment without having anyone even bother to glance at us , but maybe the scanner had already told them we were n't worth looking at . Morris Cainstraight took us into a glass-enclosed , computerlined room , and I heard the familiar hum of clean-air machines . I did n't see any metal monsters lying around on the floor , but there were several unusual vents in the walls at eye level . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . Unlike the Graphic Arts Department at NTB News , the FBI 's Atmospheric Purity Budget was coming out of the taxpayer 's pocket , so the feds had a state-of-the-art environment . Of course , in all fairness , they also had a jukebox and could catch criminals , whereas our GA could only draw them . Cainstraight closed the door and turned into a human . " How 've you been , Abby ? " " Ca n't you tell from the scanner guy downstairs ? I mean , was n't that a complete physical ? " " Nuts . When the bureau gives a complete physical , we leave bruises . You just had your prints scanned . Do n't be such a baby . " " Ah , prints . I 'm glad you brought up the subject . I happen to be in the market for the only thing you can buy with prints . " He nodded . " You want a name . " " And anything else you have . I 'm not such a baby that I do n't know the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " What 've you got ? " " Four business cards . I do n't know which one has the prints I 'm interested in . " I pulled the cards out of my pocket and held the stack out by one corner . " Can you find Waldo in this picture ? " " Do I owe you a favor , Abby ? " Cainstraight said , looking like I 'd asked to borrow his toothbrush . " FBI files are n't exactly community newspapers . "  | I tried a persuasive smile . " Maybe you 'd like to put the NTB Television Network in a headlock  --  we 'd owe you a favor . We 're not exactly a community newspaper , either . " He picked up a clear plastic sheet from the worktable in the center of the room and said , " Drop them here . " I dropped them on the plastic , and he stirred them around with a thin wooden tube , separating them so none of the edges touched . " Let 's see if we can make it easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In fact , it would be perfect if it were easy , because I came by the fingerprints easily . " " How 'd you get them ? " " Do I have to tell ? " " No , but when I track down their owner on the jukebox , I 'll either have a shrewd guess or the right to ask the question again . " " That 's why I brought Ike . She 's up on rights . " " Attorney ? " " Babe . " Ike shook her head . " I hate being treated like I 'm not even here . I 'm the senior broadcast producer of Morning Watch , with a graduate degree in journalism from the University of Missouri , Columbia . I 'm not an attorney , but I know constitutional law . And whether I 'm a babe is not a matter for discussion , unless you men want to play absolutely fair and open the talk up for consideration of your physical attributes , too . I 'll start with Abby . I 'm only looking for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you she was up on rights , " I said . " She 's also right , " Cainstraight said . " Let 's get to work . " He bent over the small spread of business cards bearing my name , title , telephone number , and the NTB logo/address . " Let 's go for the obvious , " he said , pointing to one of the cards . " This one 's dirtier than the others . " " Can you just use the scanner and get the print ? " Ike said . " Probably not . I 'll probably have to dust it . We 'll see . " There were several scanners on the table , all connected by long white wires to a central jack on the far wall . He picked up and pointed one of the scanners , and a series of the little grunts and red flashes popped over the card he had selected , but he said , " I 'm not reading it . " From a drawer under the worktable , he took a small jar of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sprayed a fine mist of the stuff over the card . He brought the scanner back over the card , made it grunt and flash , and smiled . There was a new noise . " Did you hear that ? " he said . " Yeah , " I said . " Yeah , " Ike said . The scanner had emitted a high-pitched beep . He aimed the thing again , and I counted four beeps . He turned the card over with the wooden tube and a pair of thin tongs , and aimed again . This time I counted seven beeps . Twelve in all . " I hope they 're not all yours , Abby , " he said . " Well , one of those cards has somebody 's prints on it besides mine . " Let 's see what the jukebox will play for us . " I looked around the room , and so did Ike . " I do n't see anything remotely like a jukebox , " she said . " It 's in the basement , " Cainstraight said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You break one of our live-scanners up here , we 're only out a few thousand dollars . You break a disk down there , we 're out a few million prints . " " I 'm glad you 're not treating us like we 're special or anything , " I said . " But I am , " he said . " Most civilians do n't get as far as this room . " . He took the scanner , sat down at a terminal , and gestured for us to take seats on either side of his . He booted the computer , typed for a while , and plugged the scanner into a slot in the wall above the display screen . I could hear the computer working . " Eight of the twelve prints are yours , Abagnarro , " he said . " And one is just a smudge . " " That leaves three strangers . " " They could belong to the guy who prints your cards . " " Shit . I never thought of that . " " Hang on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ text and , down the right side , windows that held pictures of fingerprints . They were so clear they looked like photographs .  | We all leaned toward the screen . " This guy 's got a distinguished service record , " Cainstraight said . " Vietnam . Two Purple Hearts and the Bronze Star . 181st infantry . Field commission . Jesus , he certainly did n't spend his time washing jeeps in the motor pool at Camp Saigon . He did two tours of Nam . No criminal record . Date of birth , January 17 , 1945 . Place of birth , New York , New York . Last address Fort Ord , where he was discharged in 1971 . Those are the highlights , and some highlights they are . " " What 's his name ? " Ike said , gripping the seat of her chair like she was having trouble sitting still . Cainstraight pushed his chair back from the computer and crossed him arms over his chest . " This is where we make the trade , " he said . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the name ? " " I want to know how you got the print . " " Abby ? " Ike said . I chewed on it for a minute . " A hypothetical question . What if I got the fingerprint while a guy was mugging me ? Would you go after him ? " " Is that all ? That 's what the NYPD is for , or supposedly for . " l k laughed at his own little joke . " I thought with all the urgency that your man was a terrorist , or maybe that serial killer . It turns out you only want your wallet back . " He scooted back to the computer and hit two keys . I looked at Ike behind Cainstraight 's back . She had her hand over her mouth , obviously hiding a nonpoker face as she read the words coming across the screen . A window at the top of the screen had opened up . Cainstraight read the text and pushed his chair back , his face expressionless . I read the text in the display @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , lacing his fingers together over his middle . " United States Army Second Lieutenant Ulysses Samuel Sylvester Raintree . " He paused , gazing at the screen . " Interesting initials your mugger has  --  U.S.S.R. " Cainstraight swiveled his chair a quarter turn toward me without taking his eyes off the name on the screen . " How the hell did you really get this fingerprint , Abagnarro ? "  | How 'd I get the fingerprint ? " I said . My voice sounded hollow to nee . " I told you . " " Yes . I remember . This guy Raintree mugged you , Abby , and that 's all you know about him . " Cainstraight nodded at the vital statistics on his screen beside the pictures of Tex 's fingerprints , and his voice took on an edge I 'd never heard in it before . " You 're too smart to yank my chain for the hell of it . Did you think this would j List fly past my nose like a bad smell on a windy day ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying not to look like the jukebox had just unloaded the answer to a huge mystery . Here I was telling a simple truth , and I felt like a liar . I 'm sure I looked like a liar . In the stillness of the room , with only the background hum of the clean-air vents making a sound , I was suddenly aware that I had skater 's B.O. I even smelled like a liar . " You did n't think anything , " he said , nodding . " You plan to start thinking anytime soon ? " " What I 'm thinking now is that the guy really mugged me , " I said . " That 's the truth . I 'm also thinking I 'm surprised the guy was an officer . I 'm really surprised he has no criminal record . The way he mugged me was highly skillful . He really mugged me , Morris . " " How 'd he get close to you ? " " I was on foot . " " What 'd he use , the Blast ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My ears still hurt . " " That 's it ? End of story ? " The white , glowing characters of Tex 's real name on the monitor screen seemed to pulse with a restless energy that separated them from the other elements of the electronic composition . For a moment , my will suspended , I stared at the name . I imagined that name lifting off the glass and actually floating in front of Cain-  | straight 's nose . I broke out of the stare , shifting my gaze to Ike . She was staring at the screen . But Cainstraight was looking at me . " Come on , Abby . What 's the real story ? " " Maybe you should give me a little hint , Morris , just so I do n't get confused about what you 're asking . " He shifted in his chair , nothing threatening , but it suddenly occurred to me to wonder if he was armed . I 'd never considered Cainstraight before as a regular FBI sort of agent , the sort that carries weapons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had always struck me as a techno-nerd dressed up in a G-man costume . But then , this was the first time he was asking me questions about criminal activity . Cainstraight kept his fingers laced over his middle , lifting only one finger out of the weave to point at the computer screen . " A hint . Sure . You want a hint . How 's this for a hint ? A man who was a guest on your program this morning died in an alley outside your building , and somebody stuck a label on his shirt that said U.S.S.R. ' That 's interesting . And here you come , bringing me a fingerprint that belongs to a man named Ulysses Samuel Sylvester Raintree . You ca n't think of anything to add to that ? " " Do I have to ? " Ike stood on her skates and made the time-out sign with her hands . " Can Abby and I talk alone , for a minute or two ? " " Of course . " He stood promptly , like Ike was his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have a phone call to make anyway . " He left the room . I watched his exit suspiciously . " I 'll bet he 's got a call to make , " I said . " Do you think this room 's bugged ? " " Did J. Edgar Hoover wear evening gowns ? " I glanced around , probably looking shifty as hell . " We 're in the FBI 's New York headquarters . What do you think ? " " Let 's go out in the hall . " We skated out the door and huddled together in the hall , whir pering . " Let 's get our priorities straight here , " Ike said , " and not get car ried away by force of habit . The main thing is to catch the killer , agreed ? I mean , that 's more important than a scoop ? "  | " Yes . " " Then you have to tell him everything about Tex . " " We could have said all this inside that room . We sound like perfect Americans . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creepy to think someone 's listening to us while we dust off our consciences . " " Let 's go back inside and be the model citizens we are . Just act natural . " " And no stupid jokes from you , Abby . I do n't want to be here all night . " I raised my hand to make the pledge . " No stupid jokes . " We returned to the room and took our seats . We were silent . Cainstraight came back about five minutes later and laughed out loud after he got a look at our angelic faces . " Much better , " he said . " You both look like you 're about ready to crack under the strain . This room 's not bugged . " " It 's not ? " I said . " Why would the bureau bug its own jukebox ? " " Because you can ? " Ike gave me a warning look . No jokes , she mouthed . " If mere ability were the standard for bugging , " Cainstraight said , his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this city so tight nobody could move . " He sat down between us and said , " I just got off the phone with Dennis Fillingeri . He says he knows you both pretty well ; apparently you think you 're the funnyman , Abby . " I smiled . " That 's only what I think I am . Did Fillingeri also tell you what I think he is ? " Ike cocked her head to one side , curiosity rampant in her blue and green eyes . " What did he say about me ? " Cainstraight hesitated . " Oh . Not much . " " What ? I deserve to know . You told Abby . " " He , uh , said you tend to be uptight and self-righteous . But I 'm sure he meant that in a good way . " Ike made a few gobbling noises , but Cainstraight was smart enough to ignore them and went on . " The point is , what I was going to say , Captain Fillingeri says you 're both essentially good citizens . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now able to form words . " I 'm just delighted for the pat on the back . " " And the bureau , " Cainstraight said , plowing over her words , " with Captain Fillingeri 's full blessing , would very much like for you to tell us all the particulars on the fingerprint collection . Consider this an official request . " " Can I get a word in here ? " Ike said , her face red . " You 're working with Fillingeri on the Yellow-Man killings ? " " Certainly . Serial killers are a little specialty of ours , like kidnapping and terrorism . " " Was this Fillingeri 's idea or yours ? " " He called us . That 's the chain . The local authority invites us onto his turf . " " How long have you been working on this ? " " Three weeks . " " Almost from the beginning ? " " That 's right . Fillingeri 's a good cop . He uses his resources well . " Ike snorted . Cainstraight looked like he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't understand , but the bureau 's been keeping a very low profile on this because our experts have been telling us that the U.S.S.R. ' note business is a political matter . And Fillingeri has been lying low , keeping his face off of newspaper covers . When it comes to serial killers , law enforcement has to play it close be cause of all the confessors out there . " " Confessors ? " Ike said . " The people who like to get attention by coming forward and saying they did it . If we released everything we had , we 'd have no way of checking their stories . " " You 've actually had people coming in to say they did these Yel-low-Man crimes ? " " We have n't . Fillingeri 's had six so far  --  that 's off the record . But none of the six could explain the U.S.S.R. ' thing or tell us how the victims died . " I raised a hand . " The part about the medical examiner not knowing the cause of death . Is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Unfortunately , no . All six confessors said they stabbed the vic-  | tims to death , which is n't true . But we do n't know what is true . The M.E. 's baffled . We 're all baffled . We thought we were on the right track about the political nature of the notes left on the corpses . Until now . Now we do n't know what to think . Now you bring us a fingerprint belonging to Second Lieutenant Ulysses Samuel Sylvester Raintree . We want to know the story . " " I 'll tell you what happened , " I began , " although first I 'd like to say that Fillingeri had a chance to ask me . He heard I was mugged and said he did n't believe it . " Cainstraight raised an eyebrow . " I wonder why not . " " We have sort of a difficult relationship . " " So I gathered . And that surprises me , given what I know of Captain Fillingeri and Midtown North . That precinct has an admirable record in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men killed in the line of duty  --  not the kind of record you pile up by cultivating difficult relationships . " " It 's partly my fault . " " Let 's see how you do with me . " I sighed and told him the Tex epic , starting with how the mugger picked me up at Lincoln Center and knew my name . I told Cainstraight everything Tex said , including his opinion of the Mets and the fact that he wanted to talk to me about killing . I told Cainstraight about trying to brush Tex off by giving him a business card , and I finished with a cold rendition of the mugging , leaving out my strictly personal reactions . " But you did n't report the crime officially ? " I shook my head . " Why not ? " " Oh , you know . I had to get to work , I 've looked at mug shots before , I 've sampled the coffee at Midtown North , I have a weird relationship with Fillingeri , and so on , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I did n't think of that at the time . It was only after we saw the mugger turn up on the videotape of the crime scene in Central Park that I started thinking about what I had in my pocket . Look , the guy only got about four bucks off me , plus my keys and I.D . I thought he was just a better-than-average pocket artist . " " Fillingeri has a copy of that videotape ? "  | " Yeah . " " I see . And you 've had no further communication with this man who calls himself Tex ? " " Not a peep . " " Have you changed the locks on the places those keys open ? " I was struck dumb . It never occurred to me . Rather abruptly , Cainstraight stood . " I 'd advise you to take care of that , Abby . In the meantime , I 'm going to share what you 've told me with Captain Fillingeri . " Ike piped up . " Speaking of sharing . You 're not going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are you ? " " I hope not . A lot depends on you . I ca n't order you not to use it ; I can request that you cooperate with us by keeping it to yourselves . Serial killers do n't stop killing until they 're caught ; a fresh kill sometimes just whets the appetite . What you 've brought us tonight may mean a great deal to what we can do in the next few days to stop this guy . You can see that having the name of that man ? whether he 's the killer or not  --  will give some new energy to this investigation . But if you put it out on the air , we 'll probably never get a smell of him . He 'll either be gone or change his methods . " " You 've probably already thought of this , " Ike said , rolling her skates back against the legs of her chair , the impact so loud in that clean , quiet room that she jumped . " Sorry . " She looked to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it be good to have some facts a little more current than 1971 ? " " You got that right . " " Does n't the jukebox have other indexes ? You only used the military and criminal files , did n't you ? " He clicked his tongue against his teeth . " That 's all we can do , I 'm afraid , as far as the jukebox goes . From here we have to go the traditional routes . " " But why ? Ca n't the jukebox check Social Services , the Welfare stuff ? They fingerprint their clients , do n't they ? " " Some counties , some states . Depends on local law . " Ike looked a little smug . " Well , well . You could run the business card prints against their rolls . " " I ca n't do that . " " Why not ? " " Because we 're in New York . "  | " So ? " " The state of New York has a law prohibiting the cross-referencing of Welfare files with our jukebox . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes , such a mingling of information amounts to the criminalization of poverty . " Ike sat back in her chair , thinking it over . " I 'm sure that 's the way the ACLU sees it , " she said . " I guess that 's the way I see it . " She looked down at her skates , seemed to be thinking it over , and looked up . " I do n't suppose you 'd ever consider breaking a law , would you ? Just one teeny little exception ? " He smiled , a real smile , warm and understanding and even a little wistful , if you can picture that on the face of an FBI special agent considering a criminal life for himself . " Not in this building . " " I did n't think you would . " " I 'd have been surprised if you did n't ask . Believe me , Captain Fillingeri had a fit just now on the phone when he asked and got turned down , just like I 'm turning you down . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I practice , " Cainstraight said , grinning . But , despite the smile , I could tell he really was n't going to bend the rules , not for us , not for Fillingeri . Although that did n't mean he would n't bend them for himself . " It 's getting late , and now that you 've brought me the name of Second Lieutenant U.S.S.R. , I 've got work to do . Your story sounds like gold to me , but we 'll be back in touch with you to get it in writing . There 's no need for that formality now . But I will have to insist that you leave the business cards with me . " I looked around at the glass walls , at the center worktable , at the computers . " You did bug this room . You 've got it all on a recording . " " You watch too much TV , Abby . I give you my word . " " Then how come I do n't have to do all that written statement hogwash ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He offered a hand , dismissing me . We shook , and he gave Ike the same treatment . " We 'll be talking again . " He escorted us back down to the lobby and to the street door . I looked longingly at the security guard , half wishing he had a procedure that would unscan our fingerprints . Ike and I were now in the  | jukebox , with all the millions of men and women who have criminal or military records , and we did n't belong in either club . When we were alone on the sidewalk , Ike put her hands on her hips and looked at the sky . " Uptight and self-righteous . That 's the stupidest thing I ever heard . " I looked at the sky . She looked at me . I kept looking at the sky . " Abby , I 'm not uptight and self-righteous . " " I did n't say you were . " " Well , I 'm not . " She stood there and breathed . " Dennis is uptight and self-righteous . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the loud breathing . " Whatever . " She waved her hand impatiently and glided a few feet toward the street . " There 's something fishy about Mr. Ness letting us go like this . " The sky was dark , darker than it had been for a week . The sick orange haze was gone , and , while I could see no stars , I found the nice clean blankness a relief after several nights of staring at the oily belly of a hot air mass squatting over Manhattan . " Fishy or not , there 's nothing we can do about it , Ike . If we 're going to use this song the jukebox just played , we 'd better get mov-ing . " The street was practically deserted around the government buildings , and we were traveling at a leisurely pace , a thoughtful pace . We turned at Worth Street and made for the even quieter emptiness of Lafayette . " The map Fred made for us , " Ike said . " The CBS Broadcast Center . " " I know it sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " As good as anything I can suggest . " " What do we actually know about Tex ? " I considered as I skated , sorting out the little encounter with my personal mugger . " He smelled like perfume . " " Perfume ? Do n't you mean cologne ? " " No . Perfume . Very flowery . " " What else ? " " He knew my name . " " That does n't help . " I thought some more . " He served in Vietnam . "  | " So did a lot of people . " " He wore a red sweater . " " Probably stole it . " " More likely got it out of a dumpster . " " What else , Abby ? " " Gold teeth . Those cost money . " Ik ! glanced over her shoulder . " That could be the Army 's dental plan . " " Gold ? " " Sure . " She skated in a circle around me and kept talking , but she was looking down Lafayette . " Twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of making caps out of porcelain , unless you were a movie star . " " So Tex was n't a movie star , " I said . " I ca n't think of anything else . He was just a big , big guy that smelled like perfume . " Ike skated closer to me and said , " Do n't look now , but we 're being followed . And I do n't think it 's Tom Hitt 's rookie Evening Watch goons . " So , of course I looked . There were two dark sedans trailing behind us a couple of blocks back , crawling up Lafayette without lights . And two men in suits , walking in the street between the cars . And a woman on a bicycle , pedaling along slowly beside one of the cars . " This is just fascinating , " I said . " I thought we were pals with the FBI . All that off-the-record camaraderie . All that hand shaking . All that we 'll be in touch ' stuff . You know what ? " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm a funnyman who tells lies and not to believe that I got the print during a mug-ging . " " Well , you did n't help by not even having your locks changed . " " I did n't think of it . " " I 've told you a million times not to be so careless with your stuff . Now look where we are . We 've got FBI agents wiggling up our spines , and all because you do n't have any common sense . You 're the same way with your credit cards . You 'll never understand that ? " I grabbed her wrist . " Stop yapping at me . " " Let go . I was n't yapping. "  | I released her wrist . " Talking , then . Stop talking . I want to talk . Do we want those guys following us ?

" I looked over my shoulder at the fuckers . " They do seem a little pushy . " " Pushy ? Pushy ? " She punched the air a couple of times with her fist . " We told them everything we know . We were awesome . We cooperated splendidly . This is some reward for good citizenship . " " I guess they want Lieutenant U.S.S.R. bad . " " Then they should find him . We 're not stopping them . And we have every right to pursue a story without interference or wit-nesses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fool around ? " She ignored that . " They 've sure got a snotty way of showing their appreciation for the huge piece of information we just dumped in their laps for free . " " So we get rid of them . " She skated around me again while we made a slow progress up Lafayette . " I 'm thinking . " " I can tell . I 'll talk while you think . I 've never tried to lose two cars , two FBI foot soldiers , and fuzz on a bike before . My only experience is with Diego Gordillo . This will take some doing . " " Hmm , " Ike said , doubt creeping into her voice . " I do n't wish to invoke a double standard here , but , while it was very stupid of Tom , he had every right to sic Diego on you . You know ? I would have done the same for the sake of a story . I wish I knew the code better here . Does the FBI have the right to just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? "  | " I do n't know about that . But they certainly do n't have to insult us by doing it so openly and with an entire armored division . Maybe we should tell on them . " " Who will we tell ? The CIA ? " She slipped her cell phone from her back pocket and started to dial . " What are you doing ? " She suspended her thumb over the phone 's key pad . " I told you I was thinking . I 've got a plan . I 'm calling Townline Cab . I 'll arrange for a limo to pick me up . One of the FBI cars will have to follow me . Then I 'll have Townline drop me at work and I 'll go out the back door .

" I raised my eyebrows . " He 's daring to follow us . " I put my arm around her waist . " I could give you a quick feel , just to make sure . " " Do n't be sickening . " She skated away from me and resumed dialing Townline . " You 're worse than the FBI . " " Sickening ? You did n't used to think it was sickening . " " That was used to . This is now . " I shrugged . I turned so I could study our pursuers . I skated backward , my hands in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Townline would take care of one of the FBI sedans . " What does your plan call for me to do ? " I asked her . " You 'll have to lose the other car , the guys on foot , and the biker . "  | Townline is the limo service Morning Watch uses to shuttle guests to and from the airport and to their hotels and to the studio for the show . Townline is also very good at pampering our anchors when they travel on remote shoots or take a notion to go shopping on Fifth Avenue during the rush hour . The drivers are also experienced at ferrying hotheaded producers into riot zones or through streets cordoned off to other motorists because the pope or the president has business in New York . Townline jockeys just whip out their New York Press license plates from under the front seat and muscle through with some intimidator from their big Mercedes fleet . A flexible company , accustomed to hearing from us at odd times of the day or night , and prompt in servicing our needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white stretch limo at the northwest corner of Fourteenth . We skated across the intersection , and the driver held a white cardboard sign up against his closed window , showing the number 501 . " That 's my number , " Ike said . I opened the door for her , and she clambered into the backseat and nestled into the blue velour cushions . " This looks like a hooker 's car , " I said . " I 'm much too uptight and self-righteous for that . " I gave her fair complexion a quick but thorough study , as much as I could with the car 's tinted windows intercepting the surrounding street light . " I think you 're right . You 'd make a better pimp . " I reached in to pat her knee . " I 'll see you in a little while . Save me some tortellini filetto . " " You can get your own , buddy . I do n't pander when I 'm a fugitive from justice . " Ike leaned forward and told the driver , " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Take the scenic route . And can you find a French Canadian talk show on the radio ? Turn it up real loud . " She experi-  | mented with the buttons on the open door until all the limo 's windows started sliding down . The nasal whine of a French Canadian meteorologist came rocketing out of the car 's many speakers ; I could feel the vibrations in the door . " What 's he saying ? " she shouted at me . I shouted , translating the words howling out of the speakers : " There 's an arctic air mass moving in on Quebec . Temperatures tomorrow in Quebec City will be in the low fifties . " Ike sat back against the cushions , stretched out her legs , and put her hands behind her head . " Oh , the weather , " she yelled . " I need to work on numbers , so this will be good . I 'm way behind on my conversational tapes . If only I had some crackers . " She leaned forward again toward the Townline driver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de food ? " I closed the door , smiling at Ike 's idea of occasionally learning French , and the limo eased away from the curb , its speakers blasting . I guess she was going to teach the FBI a little French while she was at it . I stood there on the corner and watched as one of the unmarked sedans slowly and ever so casually fell in line behind the Townline stretch , staying a couple of car lengths back of the long white Mercedes . Technique . I stood and watched , skating in random circles , until the little parade made the turn to go north on Sixth Avenue . My own more complicated entourage was parked , down a block on Fourteenth , waiting for me to make a move . I retraced my path across Fourteenth , pulling a couple of bills out of my back pocket and selecting a ten as I coasted into the gutter . The swarm of battery-operated plastic toys still covered the sidewalk , still laying eggs and squirting strings of milk on the pavement . Still going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hoped . I bent and palmed one of the plastic rats as I skated by , tossed the street vendor the ten , and circled back into the street , holding the wiggling toy in my hand , against my shirt . It felt like the annoying jazz you get from those motel beds that take quarters . Heading west , I took stock . The entourage was moving now . The car would be easy . The FBI infantry would be a laugh . The bicyclist would be the big problem .  | What I needed first , I thought , was a narrow place . I held on to the buzzing rat and leaned on my edges , gathering speed on my way to Chelsea . I knew just the place to drop the FBI sedan . Chelsea is high on my list of places , anyway , where the feds should spend some time . I led everyone over to Eighth Avenue and made a wide , leisurely turn , going north . The poor slobs on foot had to run to keep up . I started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathering speed , and made a quick , tight right on Sixteenth . I zipped right again at the middle of the block , through the crevice/alley where the residents of 224 West Sixteenth Street ( including an NTB editor named Ariel Colinsky ) keep their garbage cans in an orderly row of gray plastic . There was plenty of room for me to navigate , and the only trouble for the foot patrol would depend on their physical fitness , and the cyclist would have to use her hands against the brick walls to keep her tires in a line , but the sedan had about as much chance of entering that alley as Charles Manson has of getting into the DAR . I could hear the men running behind me , and I caught the sound of a garbage can rolling , but bikes do n't make a lot of noise ( at least , not the expensive kind they issue to FBI riders ) , so I had to look over my shoulder to make certain I had n't lost that element of my fan club . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the walls with a smile on her face , enjoying things now that things were going . She knew she was the one I was really playing tag with . The alley takes a jog before it empties out on Fifteenth , which , if you 're not up on the local geography , can give you a nasty shock . I simply shifted my weight for the turn , but there must have been a slight mix-up among my pursuers because I heard a little federal four-letter word . Oh , well , I thought , free speech at work for America . Once out on Fifteenth , I turned right and again took off for Eighth Avenue , completing the circle I had started . I sailed past Sixteenth , got a view of the rear end of the stranded FBI sedan , and continued north , but now I poured on the speed . I would n't have chosen that particular avenue , which is maybe the sleaziest in New York , if I were a novice on skates . And even an expert skater should stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up when you 're Rollerblading is to pass one of your wheels over a used condom ,  | those little rubber signposts to both what you can purchase and what fate hands out for free on Eighth Avenue . If you hit a dead condom just right , it wraps itself around the lead wheel , and the least that can happen is that you 'll probably flip a couple of times . But Eighth Avenue  --  that wide strip of garish , flashing neon and cheap food and dangerous games of chance like sex for sale  --  is one hell of a roller coaster for cyclists , because they ca n't jump potholes , and because of all the drunks and all the folks raddled on bad drugs and all the fourteen-year-old hookers , male and female , who like to reach out and touch someone , especially bikers . The crazies usually leave bladers alone because we 've got more swerve power than people riding on only two wheels welded to a solid body . Bladers can bend at the knees , the waist , wherever is required , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By the time I was crossing Twenty-third , there was no longer a question of the men on foot . But my grinning friend on the bike was n't even working up a sweat . When I glanced back at her , from time to time , I saw the same happy smile . I could tell she liked her work . She had a twelve-speed and as much confidence as Muhammad Ali when he was still God . That 's how I knew she 'd never in her life been on Eighth Avenue after dark . Probably just up from I ) . C. I wanted to get rid of her while we were still on amateur turf , before we entered territory where she could really get hurt . Eighth Avenue , by the time you get to the forties , is the War Zone . When you give your regards to Broadway on this avenue , the lyrics are " joints or nickel bags , wanta boy , do coke , wanta girl , blow crack , gim me a dollar , come inside . " And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and from the porno and slasher movie palaces , and from the peep shows on the side of the Deuce , and from the hooker hotels , and from homemade tapes in boom boxes , and from neon marquees that spell out the lullaby in flashing monotony . I would soon run out of clean turf to work with , and I decided I 'd have to lose the FBI 's bicyclist way before we reached the Port Authority , where the massive bus traffic could rip her elbows off and where the pros on foot would either have her wheels or she 'd have to pull a gun , assuming she was equipped . And then they 'd pull a gun . And then somebody else would see the guns and pull  | their guns , and then someone would see a better gun than he had and try to trade up and then .. . At Thirtieth , I tore into a sudden right turn , the kind of turn my biker friend could n't possibly execute as fast as I did it  --  it 's kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a frozen lake compared to what a sled pulled by a team of very healthy dogs can do . The sled may be faster over the long haul , but the skater 's got the moves . Guessing the wide angle she 'd have to follow to make the turn , I lay in wait in the dark on Thirtieth , ducked between two parked cars , for maybe five seconds , and put my jazzing rat down on the street . He went for her front tire like it was made out of plastic cheese . That little battery was a marvel . The impact was n't enough to throw her over the handlebars , but her wheels skidded out from under her sideways . And I heard the nails-on-blackboard sound of the bike 's chain etching itself into the street . She was good . She somehow stayed on her feet , leaping aside and hopping on one foot as the bike bumped and rotated , screeching on the cement . I did n't wait to see if she handled her face and her vocabulary as well as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street . I was on my way back to the brightness of Eighth Avenue , concentrating now on my own safety as I sped around the islands of human emptiness , or maybe it was fullness , or whatever interior physics it is that makes these people rob or beg or sell parts of themselves or rent out space in their bodies so they can afford the drugs that rearrange their internal chemistry in a desperate attempt to fix what it was that the physics had done . I was lucky . Even though I skated through a puddle of lumpy vomit , spraying a guy in black tights and a yellow wig who pulled a knife ; and a freckled girl in a tight green dress tossed a Styrofoam container full of beer under my wheels and yelled " Hey , taxi ! " ; and a tall , skinny pimp in purple sequins grabbed one of my belt loops hard enough to pull it off  --  I managed to stay upright , an outcome I attribute to the fact that I registered all of those ceremonial dances just enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me for signs of sloppy condoms . All the other stuff is just circus trappings for the expert skater passing through the Big Top ;  | the condoms are an invitation to the Rollerblader afterlife . I slowed up once I reached the relative civilization of Forty-sixth Street and Restaurant Row . That was good , because it gave me time to realize what a dumb move it would be to attempt to enter my mother 's restaurant through the front door . I may be Carole Abag-narro 's baby boy , but I smelled like some of the human detritus frolicking in the grim wonderland of Eighth Avenue 's nightly flesh-and-drugs bazaar , and I would not be a welcome sight coming through the historic portal of Gypsy 's , that theater district shrine my mother runs . Once again , I chose to pilot a raunchy alley , and it was there , as I politely steered for the back door to Gypsy 's like a considerate relative , that I got what Eighth Avenue had n't been able to arrange . A large and loud white cat leaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my right leg , grabbing at my laces . He scared the daylights out of me and I went down , mostly on my left elbow , but it felt like my ribs had shaken loose . I cussed in the two languages I know best , but not as loud as the cat . As soon as he was finished with his fit , he made off into the shadows , and I was left to cuss alone . When I was out of words , I returned to the ones I had already used and cussed some more , lying there on my side in the alley , not really hurt , but angry at the irony of successfully shaking the FBI only to be completely screwed by the CAT . I picked myself up , bent my arm and held my elbow under the globe of light that was suspended over the kitchen door , and inspected the gravel , blood , and yellow slime that might have been cheese . I opened the kitchen door and skated into my mother 's sparkling slice of heaven , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her shiny copper pots and the fresh vegetables on the cutting island and the beautiful blonde with the strangely misharmonized eyes , gorging herself at the end of the counter on a plate of pasta almost certainly made fresh that after-noon . Ike looked up from her meal . The chefs , in their white hats and full-length aprons , looked up from their cauldrons . My mother pushed open the double doors and stepped into the room . " Something smells in here , " she whispered , as the doors closed behind her . Then she saw me . " Abby , you 're hurt ! "  | " Yeah , and I 'm also what smells . " Ike looked a little sick , and I knew it was n't the pasta . " Is that blood , Abby ? " I glanced down at my T-shirt and saw bright red smears . My side must be an expanded version of my elbow , I thought . " It ai n't a rare and precious Bordeaux , " I said . My mother was beside me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get infected if we do n't clean you up fast . " " You got a glass of wine for me , Ma ? " " Not until we go in the mudroom and wash that elbow off wit h hydrogen peroxide , and see what you 've done to your chest . People in this kind of trauma should not drink . " She winked at me . " A head wound , maybe I 'd give you wine . " She told one of the chefs to take a mop to the tracks I had left on her immaculate linoleum , and took my hand and dragged me into the mudroom , the double-wide closet where my dad had installed a sink big enough to wash the kind of pots Italian cooks use . Big enough for an Irish wolfhound  --  or a ten-year-old boy , as I knew from experience . I felt like a ten-year-old all over again . She even dunked my head under the faucet over the huge sink , and she used the little black spray hose on my skates . The stuff that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost made me lose my appetite . She made me leave the skates in the mudroom , and when I joined Ike at the steel counter , I was no longer full of my triumph over the forces of law and order . I was just hungry and humiliated and my elbow hurt like hell . The skin covering the left side of my rib cage stung , the same kind of feeling as when you have a paper cut on your index finger and you splash aftershave into your hand  --  but multiplied over a large area . Ike was toying with a glass of wine and looking a little pale . " So , " she said , too casually , " they had the nerve to touch you ? " " Who ? " " Who ? You sit there and say who ' ? The FBI , that 's who . " " No , they did n't even get near me . It only took me about fifteen blocks to ditch them . How about you ? " " No problem . In one door and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? "  | " Abby , what the hell happened to you ? You came in here looking like they mauled you . " " It was a cat . " " It was not . " " I swear to God . " " You make me so mad . You 're always blaming things on cats . " One of the sore spots of our marriage , as it turns out , was a big orange hairy creature she calls " The Donald . " I had never actively harrassed the animal , nothing more violent than an occasional well-placed suggestion on his rump to get off the expensive couch where he piled his fur , but Ike likes to insist that I abused him . I maintain that it was the other way around , in terms of abuse between me and The Donald . My reasoning was that when he went out and got a job so he could charge a couch on his Mastercard , he could poke me in the rump . Ike took my cold , logical , reasonable stand as additional evidence that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one ) , and has never let me off the hook about cats . My mother brought me a plate of tortellini and took a seat across from us . " It 's good to hear you spatting again , " she said , gazing at us fondly . " You would n't bother to squabble with each other if your feelings were dead . " " My feelings are very much alive , " I said , grabbing the fork my mother was holding out to me , " as I have consistently maintained . Everyone knows the divorce was not my brainstorm . " Ike made a point of checking her watch . " It 's after ten o'clock . We 've only got a couple of hours to find Tex before I have to change and get to work . " " No problem , " I said , " let me just finish this tortellini , and I 'll go outside and start yelling his name . Which name should I yell ? Tex , or U.S.S.R. ? " Ike took a gulp of her wine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ulysses Samuel Sylvester Raintree calls himself Tex ? Why not New York ? He was born in New York . " " Nobody , " I said , " would call himself New York . ' Can you imagine ? Howdy , partner , call me New York . ' At least Tex is recognizably a name . "  | " What I mean is , why not use one of his own names ? He has a large collection to choose from . " " Aha , Miss , which is short for Missouri  --  ever notice how many women are named Miss ? I happen to have an answer to that ques-tion . " " I 'll bet . " " Listen . He 's a war hero , with two  --  no , three  --  citations for heroism . He did two  --  not one  --  tours of Vietnam . He got his offi-cer 's commission on the field . " " So ? " " So he 's a patriot . That 's something we know about Tex . " " Are you suggesting we look for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm suggesting a reason why he 'd call himself something other than that long name which can only remind him of the Evil Empire  --  U.S.S.R. " " That 's a big help . " " Look , Ike , you started this conversation about his name . As for where to look , I 've got no idea . " My mother held up both hands for silence , the boss in her own kitchen . " Why do n't you tell me about Tex , Abby ? Ike has told me what she knows , and all about that computer map and the fingerprint , but you 're the one who got mugged , and I 'd like to hear it in your own words . " " That sounds like fun , " I said . " I like telling this story over and over again . Especially because it makes me look so big and strong . I love telling stories where I come off as a major jerk . " " Getting mugged does n't make you a jerk , " my mother said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victim . " She gave Ike a long-suffering look . " Men are such children . It was the same with Abby 's father : always he had to be strong , always had to be the winner , always had to be the toughest guy on the block . " She looked past Ike 's shoulder , into some middle distance , some other time , some different reality than the pristine kitchen on Forty-sixth Street . " That 's what made his final days so hard for him . He thought he could beat cancer if he were only strong enough , or smart enough , or man enough . So , in a way , for him , the cancer was his own fault , you know what I mean ? Joe hated himself at the end . " Ike reached across the counter and held my mother 's hand .  | I put down my fork . I 'd never heard my mother talk about my dad 's death like that before . " Ma , I 'm sorry . That must have made it worse for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Abby . " There was a long silence . I stared at my plate of tortellini . This was the argument I never start with my mother , the one where I would tell her that I am not Joe Abagnarro . I am not like my dad , I thought , not all caught up in that Old World , Saint Paul macho-guilt about personal shame , and being all things to all men , and the humiliation of losing the race , and the sinfulness of being weak . " Tell your mother about Tex and the mugging , " Ike said , in the tone of voice a shrink might use to coax a patient at the breakthrough point . " Maybe it would help to hear it without the wisecracks you always cover up with . I admit I never really thought of you as Tex 's victim ; I was only thinking of his connection to Yellow-Man . " I looked at Ike , my eyebrows up . " Since when are you a convert to the idea that the Brotherhood of Man includes me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some kind of basket case . I 'm not covering up anything with wisecracks . I was mugged . I never made any secret of the fact . " " You did n't report it to the police . " " Big deal . I only lost four bucks . Lots of people get mugged in New York . It 's been in all the newspapers . And you can stop trying to analyze me . I do n't personally happen to have a thing about being mugged . Everyone else has a thing about it : you thought it was trivial ; Tom Hitt thinks the world rotates around it ; Fillingeri does n't believe it and he 's got the FBI not believing it . The only reason I 'm still thinking about it at all is that Tex opened his big mouth instead of just opening my pockets . " " Then just tell me , Abby , " my mother said , " if it 's not a thing for you . " I did , and I did n't skimp on the details . I took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dante across from Lincoln Center to Tex 's sweet aroma , to Tex watching the Vietnam documentary I had directed , to the fact that Tex knew my name , to the copy of  | D.Q. lying open on the sidewalk , to Tex 's exit down into the Columbus Circle subway station . My mother got up and poured me a glass of wine . She brought it to the counter and put it in my hand . " I have one suggestion , " she said . " What ? " Ike said . " That map you had the computer expert draw ? " " Yeah ? " " Look where he told you to , on West Fifty-seventh . " " At CBS ? " Ike was using her fork to draw circles in the sauce on her plate . " If I remember right , " my mother said , " there 's a perfume company across the street from CBS . " " Holy mackerel , " Ike said . " You might not know , because their sign only has letters , not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or W.I.R. , something like that . I think it 's a research and development facility . The company has been there since the CBS building was a dairy , a long time ago . " My mother started to smile , a slight movement of her lips , almost to herself , pleased with her suggestion . She started for the swinging doors and the dining room . " I 've got a large crowd for a Monday night . You think about what I said . " " Wait a minute , " Ike said . " Wait just a minute . Monday night . " " What 's the matter , dear ? " my mother said , her hand on the door . " What difference does Monday make ? " Ike turned to me . " Abby , you said you thought Tex had played football , that he liked to swing linebackers or something . " " Yeah ? " My mother stepped back to the counter . " You never liked football , Abby . Always you were outside on the street running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit down long enough to watch a football game with your father on Sunday . " Ike was waving her hand to stop the trip down memory/guilt lane . " Football , " she said . " Football . Monday Night Football . It 's only preseason games , but it 's games . " I gave her a look . " If you ask me , Ike , your addiction to football is worse than your addiction to The Donald . "  | " Do n't start on the cat . I know where to look for Tex  --  at least I think I do . " " Where ? " " Tex told you himself where to start , Abby . " She was bouncing on her stool . " At that Radio Shack . That 's where Tex watches TV . And that 's where he found out about you , Abby . Anyway , that 's where he started  --  watching television . " We left by the back door . It was n't too hard to figure that once they 'd lost us , the FBI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it would n't take them long to look up Abagnarro in the Manhattan White Pages . We 're on the first page of the listings . And there 's only two of us : me and Carole , who gives her number at Gypsy 's both under her name and under the name of the restaurant . She does n't list her home phone . Of course , if the FBI was looking in the other borough directories , they 'd be very busy in Queens , the adopted home of the Abagnarros of Sicily . Our listings start on the first page there , too , but we go on over to the next page . Large family . I vetoed taking Ike up Eighth Avenue , where we could skate with the traffic to Fifty-seventh , on the most direct route to the Radio Shack where Tex might be spending his hours as a , well , sidewalk potato . While Ike 's not as fast on blades as I am , she 's plenty fast . And she knows as many tricks as I do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they mouth off or make a grab . Since Ike usually lets me lead when we skate or when we dance , we went over to Ninth and skated uptown against the traffic , which is the kind of stupid stunt we do n't usually do and that makes a lot of New Yorkers hate bikers , who do it all the time . Rollerbladers , in general , have much better manners . And they 're better looking .  | If you want to see good city skaters , and lots of them , you should go to Minneapolis . They 've got more bladers than any other town in the world , and that 's not per capita . It 's just more . And Sacramento ranks second in number , but those California bladers are into flashy moves rather than efficient transportation . New York , which is way down at number fifteen on the list , hardly rates as a blading capital in terms of sheer numbers of wheels , but you ca n't beat the Big Burg for a proving ground . Like the song says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it anywhere . Lots of would-be bladers wash out here because they ca n't figure out the rules of the road , and that makes learning the moves difficult . When I first started blading in Manhattan , I could n't decide if I was a pedestrian or a car , and was n't sure which set of rules to fol - low . Then I discovered that the decision was n't up to me . For beginning skaters , whether you 're a pedestrian or a car depends on the buses , and how they muscle around their stops . Bus drivers iii New York actively target bladers . They hate our guts . Often , in the early days of learning the sport , I was forced up onto the sidewalk to save my life , which made me a pedestrian . After I 'd done some improving , learning how to anticipate the buses before they came after me , I was definitely a car , using any lane I chose and staying off the sidewalks most of the time . Still , I never had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pecks trian . I have now passed beyond the petty distinctions that separate pe destrians from cars . When I am on blades , and this goes for Ike , too , I am not a car and not a pedestrian . I am an alien presence , a thing from the great beyond , the advance guard of a superior spe cies , and that 's why buses hate me . I do n't have to abide by any rules now that I can fly  --  now that I can warp time and space , can leap giant puddles and down whole flights of stairs , can ignore gridlock as though it were a mere gnat on the bow of the Q E 11. and , as I had recently discovered , can even thumb my nose at t he Federal Bureau of Investigation . But . I am not immune to bullets . Guns scare me . And the one burning question I had not resolved in my mind about Tex , even more burning than the question of whether he was a serial killer , was the sizzling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many  | people are carrying these days that it pays to keep your Kevlar vest out of the cleaners . Tex had n't used any heat on me during our one and only encounter , but he had n't needed to . However , he had certainly needed firearms in Vietnam , and evidently he was good with them , given his dazzling service record , so my decision to take Ninth Avenue was also a delaying tactic to give me time to think over two things : 1 . Should I pass on the Tex project and go home to bed ? 2 . If I did n't pass , how the hell could I dump Ike ? Dumping a blader who is almost as good as you are takes one thing and one thing only : intervention from an outside agency , like a lightning strike . Gimmicks like plastic rats would work with Ike about as well as Tylenol against sniper fire . You see , Ike likes danger . She likes being scared . Terror turns her on . The thought of Tex with a gun , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give Ike what she would regard as a legitimate journalistic charge , the kind of energy that had made her crawl under barbed wire in the Negev to get the exclusive story on the Sayeret Matkal , Is-rael 's elite and most heavily armed Spy Gala , during the Gulf War . " Ike , " I said . " Forget it , Abby . " So we skated up Ninth , switching lanes against the traffic as opportunity knocked , getting fingers and remarks from cabbies who did n't like having us in their faces . At the corner of Fifty-seventh , we stopped and peered down the block and across the street at the dark shop windows . There was a lot of foot traffic on Fifty-seventh , because it 's always well lit , but there was no mistaking the big guy in the red sweater . I had n't for one minute believed that Ike and I would find him , so it was a shock to see him , and he looked much bigger than I 'd remembered , even half a block away . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the block , his back to the sidewalk strollers , his huge bulk outlined by the flickering bluish gray lights coming from inside the store from more than one television . " Damn , " I said . " That 's him . "  | " I thought you wanted to find him . " " Wrong . I started by wanting to find out who owned the fingerprint on my business card . It was learning the answer that turned a tiny , harmless errand into the Holy Grail . Now that we know that Tex is U.S.S.R. , I 'd much rather lapse into my earlier amnesia and go to your apartment . I 'll teach you some French you 'll never forget . " " Abby , you do n't mean it . We 're this close to him , and you ca n't possibly mean it . I know you . You 've been to more global hot spots than I have , and you 've never complained about danger , not even in Saudi Arabia when that Scud missile barely missed you . Not even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . " " If I 'd had the sense to wear a Yankees cap , nobody would have shot at me . " She ran both hands through her hair like she was thinking of pulling it out in clumps . " I 'll go see Tex myself . I do n't need you , as though you were my arm , or my leg , or my mind . There 's no way I 'd pass up an opportunity like this . " " Opportunity . " " That 's right , Abby . Opportunity . " " You mean threat . " " Bull . " " All right , all right . I never knew anybody so pigheaded . But you follow me . " " Why ? Because you 're the man ? " " Just do it . " " Why ? " " Because otherwise I wo n't play . Take it or leave it . " She could n't stamp her foot at me , not on blades , but I could tell she wanted to . " Oh , all right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . I learned it from a master less than twenty-four hours ago . " " What ? " " Stay behind me , at least twenty feet , and watch . " She nodded her head , and I took off . I crossed Fifty-seventh with the light , coasted up the curb , and got behind a couple sauntering along on the sidewalk , their arms around each other . They looked very cozy , walking along and  | squeezing each other and laughing quietly . I skated slowly in their wake , keeping just far enough back so they would n't think I was trying to listen in . As they drew even with Tex , his face up against t he window , I slid behind him and screamed as loud as I could right into his ear . His hands went up like lightning to cover his head , and my hands were all over him , rapidly patting every square inch I could reach to answer my burning question about the gun . He did n't have one . Before he could turn around to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteen feet . The cozy couple was way ahead of me , scampering down the block toward the lights and safety of Coliseum Books at Fifty-seventh and Broadway , always open late for folks on the lam . Tex turned , flexed at the knees , his hands in fists . Some instinct or training had kicked in , despite his obvious disorientation . He looked at me and shook his head . He stood up a little straighter . " Lieutenant Raintree , " I said . When I said his name , he whirled away from me and started to run . But Ike was there , and anything Tonya Harding can do on ice , Ike can do with blades on pavement . She turned her speeding wheels into a tight spin and flung her leg out straight in his path , right across his lower abdomen , in a smooth flying camel . The impact threw her off balance , but it threw Tex to the sidewalk , clutching his gut . Ike concentrated on her edges , stumbled out of the spin that had given her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swept into a wide curve that took her bumping across the curb and into the street before she completely recovered control . As she skated back to the sidewalk , Tex was getting to his knees . I slid up next to him and offered a hand , which he looked at but did not touch . " What you want with old Tex ? " he said . " What that she-devil want to hurt old Tex for ? I ai n't done nothing to you . " " You did plenty to me , " I said . " Remember me ? The name 's Abagnarro , and you owe me four bucks . " " I do n't know you or owe you , man . " " Well , I know you . You 're Ulysses Samuel Sylvester Raintree . You used to be an officer in the United States Army . You were dec-  | orated three times for bravery in Vietnam . And you were in Central Park last night when that Yellow-Man victim was found . We 've got you on videotape . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " The FBI told me . " " Aw , shit . " He sat down on the sidewalk and inched back against the building , pushing his large shoulders into the bricks like he wanted to knock the building over . " The F-fucking-BI . A videotape . Poor old Tex . " He put the heels of his filthy , beautiful hands against his forehead , like that would help push the building over . When he finished the pushing and looked up , either he had rearranged his face or there was a different man looking out of those big eyes . " You should have a better videotape , Mr. Abagnarro . You are way behind the times . You have no videotape of the latest Yellow-Man victim , Mr. Abagnarro , because he has n't been found yet . I painted him about forty-five minutes ago . What do you think of that , TV director ? Life 's full of surprises , is n't it ? " What I thought of that was that I wished we had n't lost the FBI . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big Reeboks . " Two different names , and two different ways of speaking English , " she said . He shook his head and leaned it carefully against the bricks , no longer pushing . " Who 's this , Abagnarro ? Why 'd you bring Cinderella to old Tex 's ball ? " " Cinderella makes her own decisions , Tex , " Ike said . " There 's been another killing ? Tonight ? Did you kill another man ? " " I did n't kill him . " " Did you kill all those other men and paint their faces ? " " I did n't kill ' em . " " But you painted them ? " Tex pushed his open hand up at her face , showing her the wide yellow streaks across his fingers . " If I did , it must have been bright yellow . If there 's a note , it must have my name on it . " " Why ? " ? " Why ? " He gave her a look so cold with hatred , or anger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wanted to grab Ike and get her away from him . But Cinderella was making her own  | decisions , and I did n't think any manhandling from me would work on her . She probably could n't get a skate across my belly , not with me also equipped , but she would be difficult . Tex kept his eyes on Ike , maybe sensing she had turned herself into an immovable object . " Cinderella , I 'm not your fairy godmother . Why should I tell you why anything ? " " Because . . . because if you tell us , nobody can compel us to repeat what you said . If you have something you want to say , we 're the safest people you could tell . " " Is this some Constitution bullshit ? " " Well , the First Amendment is important , of course , but I 'm talking about a New York statute called the Shield Law . " " What 's that ? " " It 's a law that protects the privacy of certain kinds of information . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her sexual history introduced into a court of law . And like right now . The Shield Law says courts ca n't make journalists talk about information they get from protected sources . " " Old Tex is a protected source ? " " All I have to do to make you a protected source is to promise not to reveal anything you tell me . My promise covers Mr. Abagnarro , too . We both promise to protect you from discovery as the source of anything you tell us . " The flash of his gold teeth as his lips split into a cruel grin made me think of movie vampires . " You plan on believing what old Tex says ? " Ike cocked her head to one side and considered him from the elevation her skates gave her . " Maybe . I can see the paint on your lingers . " " But you ca n't see the bile in my veins , Cinderella , or the pollution in my soul , or the fire burning in my thoughts . You ca n't see a why . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look like something instead of looking like nothing . You believe that ? " " I do n't understand , " Ike said , slowly and carefully squatting over her skates and looking straight into his scary eyes . " Homeless man dies on the street , it 's nothing . So I made it something . A bright yellow something , bright enough so nobody could miss it . "  | " And you stabbed them , too ? " " With my little knife . " He licked his lips . " Wanta see it , Cinderella ? Old Tex 'll give you a real nice feel . " " Oh , my God , " she said , rising quickly . She looked at me , but I shook my head . " I 'm not sure , " I said . " I was looking for a gun . " " Scare you ? Supposed to scare you . " Tex tapped his big forehead with a dirty fingernail . " Supposed to scare everyone . " " Okay , I 'm scared , " Ike said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But Tex , " she said , " you know about being scared , right ? You were in Vietnam . " " Scared all the time . " " And it did n't stop you from doing your job , did it ? " " No way . Made me good at my job . " " I 'm good at my job , which is finding out the truth . So it 's good that you 're scaring me , you see ? " He nodded . She kept going . " If you did n't kill those men , how did you know where the bodies were ? How did you know where to go with the paint and your knife ? " " I did n't know all of them . There 's a couple or so went without paint . Wandered out of the area and died . Homeless man dies and it 's nothing . Just wander around and die . But mostly my men stay close around here . Got nowhere else to go , do they ? I try to watch over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too drunk or too stoned or too crazy or too sick . I painted my men so they would n't disappear into that boat to Potter 's Field without no one taking no-tice . " " But how did you know  --  I mean , why did you . . . what made you start . . . Jesus , I do n't know what I 'm trying to say . " Tex looked up at me . It was shocking , like he was transferring his intelligence and his will as he transferred the direction of his gaze . For an instant I was transported back to the ragged jungle that for me was only a history lesson , to the landscape of the Vietnam documentary . And , I imagined , farther back , to the ragged jungle when it was too new and bloody for a documentary , when it was seeding the legacy I would direct for television . I would have followed Tex  | where he chose to lead . His enemy would have been my enemy . What he said , I 'd do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he was just a big , dirty man sitting on the street . " That 's what I was trying to tell you last night , Mr. Busy Television Man . Old Tex got ta bear witness . But old Tex ca n't do it all . I did n't have to tell you squat . There was n't no FBI looking over my shoulder last night . I selected you , but you 're just like everybody else in New York . Step around the bum and keep on moving . " " We 're not stepping around now , " I said . " How come ? " " Because Cinderella here wants to know the truth about these killings . " Tex turned his attention back to Ike , studying her face , studying her hands , his gaze moving down to study her skates . " What 's your real name , honey ? " " Ike . " " That so ? " " Well , that 's what everybody calls me . " " Ike , the truth is , those men knew they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to die and it was for Tex to be there when they died to turn their dying into something so it would n't be nothing . " " How 'd they know they were going to die ? " " The doctor said . " " What doctor ? " " Do n't know . The doctor that was paying them . " " Paying them for what ? " " Experimental drug testing . Good money  --  twenty dollars each time they took the drug . I told ' em not to do it . It 's like Russian roulette with a full metal jacket in every chamber , I 'd say . Sipping napalm through a straw , I 'd tell ' em . Might as well lie down on a grate and fall asleep so some punk can set them on fire . They do it all the time , the punks . Gives ' em a kick . " He shook his greasy head back and forth , back and forth , slowly . " Wo n't find Tex sleeping on the street . Got ta watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me on fire . " " Your men . What drug were they testing ? "  | " You think I know ? " " Tex , you know that one of the dead men was a doctor , do n't you ? " He nodded . " Saw it on the headline sign in Times Square . Big flashing words , zipping around to tell the world . " " Did you paint him , too ? " For the first time , Tex looked cagey , like he had n't made up his mind whether he 'd painted Hektor Stefanopolis . " What if I did ? " " If you painted him , maybe you know who killed him . " " Maybe I do . Maybe I do n't . Do n't suppose I do . " " Tex , the doctor was n't like your friends . He was n't being paid as a subject in an experimental drug program . " " Maybe I do n't know anything about that . " " Tex , did you kill the doctor ? " " The last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I got paid to kill him by the United States of America . " Ike pushed back on her wheels , away from Tex , and bent over her skates , stretching her legs . She squatted back down , but from the new distance , and faced Tex again . " Does the name Stefanopolis mean anything to you ? " " No . " " He was the doctor who died this morning in an alley near the Emerald City . The doctor whose name you saw on the news zipper in Times Square . " Tex shook his head . Back and forth against the wall , he shook his head . I could imagine the greasy stain that would show up in the morning light on the building 's facade . Ike watched him until the head-shaking stopped . " Does the name Quintinale mean anything to you ? Have you heard that name before ? She 's a doctor . " " Ai n't my doctor . " " Do you know the name of the doctor who was giving your men the medicine that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't ever introduced , like . " " Do you know what the doctor looks like ? " " Only saw him at the shanties the once . Did n't catch his face good , it being so dark and him too far away . I see him from a long way off . " " It was a man ? "  | " Was n't no woman . " Ike flipped a hand impatiently . " You stopped Mr. Abagnarro last night because you wanted him to help you , right ? " " Something like that . " " I can help you . But you have to tell me what you were going to tell him . " " How can you help ? You on TV ? I never saw eyes like yours . I 'd remember if I 'd seen you on TV . And I ai n't seen Cinderella ' in the credits . " " I 'm a producer . I work for the same network Mr. Abagnarro works for . " I thought it was time for me to join the huddle on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I squatted , the one thing Ike does better on blades than I do . It was awkward , and I did n't feel so much like an alien being , the advance force of a superior life-form . " Ike 's much more important than I am , Tex . She makes the decisions about what gets on the air . " He eyed her steadily . That look was back . She met his intensity and matched it . Her eyes are not easy to meet , especially when she 's excited . But his were n't , either . The cell phone in her back pocket rang . She ignored it , but Tex looked at her rear suspiciously , the moment broken . " That a beeper ? " he said . " Just a cell phone . I 'm not going to answer it . " " I 'm gon na stand up , " he said . " Get some air . Keep your skates away from me . " Ike and I got to our feet and gave him room . Her phone kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , even with me on skates . " Outside of that doctor , " he said , " which I painted when I saw that a rich man would not pass through the eye of the needle as easy as a bum , but over which I got no jurisdiction , so maybe it was n't right , the Yellow-Men all lived in the shanties over by the Hudson . At the end of Fifty-sixth Street . They were recruited to take drugs and got paid for it . They were warned that the drugs could be dan-gerous . " When did this start ? " Ike said . " About two , three months ago . I got no calendar . " " And these men started getting sick ? "  | " Yeah . Real bad side effect . " He gave her a twisted , mean grin . " Death . " Ike bowed her head and looked at her hands . I kept my eyes on his hands . That remark about the little knife had been unsettling , even though I was pretty sure I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his body . Ike kept looking at her hands . " And the only reason you painted them was to call attention to their deaths ? " Tex cast another look at Ike 's backside , apparently fascinated by her phone . He was jumpy , agitated , his hands twitching at his sides . " Ai n't no other reason a sane man would paint his men . I had a Vietnam buddy made the boat ride to Potter 's Field . Wind and weeds and cats and convicts ate his dignity before the worms could get it . A man 's place in the ground supposed to be sacred  --  his resting place , not a human dump . A man gets no rest on this earth . Ought a get it below . " Tex edged away from the wall . He was ready to take off . He had n't liked the sound of Ike 's cell phone . Nervous energy danced along his body almost as if it were electrified . " Wait , " Ike said . " I have to know if you saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor giving your men drugs . " " The doctor was n't my man , Miss Cinderella Ike . I got no responsibility on that except the stain on my hands . " He sidestepped the entrance to Radio Shack and backed away from us , his limbs trembling , his hands fluttering . " You can follow me on those skates and harass old Tex , but I got nothing more to say . The subject is closed . You got all I got for you . You can tell the FBI about the shanties , but I wo n't be there . Shield Law gon na protect you , maybe protect a girl gets raped . There ai n't no Shield Law for old Tex . " Ike clutched her hair , but she stayed put . Tex kept back-stepping . He stuck his trembling hand into a deep pocket in his dirty chinos , a cunning look on his big face . Ike reached for my hand and we rolled backward together , afraid to turn away from him , mesmerized by what he was doing with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knife , after all . " You want your shit , man ? " he said . " What ? " His hand came snaking out of his pocket , and a spray of silver  | and gold and copper came arcing through the air , landing in a clash of metal at my feet . Keys . He kept back-stepping . All the way to the corner . He turned around there , and , without bothering to check the traffic , bolted across the street . " Hey , Tex ! " I shouted . When he reached the curb , he looked back over his shoulder . " What ? " " Where 's my I.D . badge ? " He grinned at me , his big gold teeth looking like rocks in his mouth . " In hell , man . " " I want it back . " " Go get it , then . " He turned away , ready to sprint . " Hey , Tex ! " " What ? " " Where 'd you play football ? " He laughed , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down Ninth between our positions . " U.T. , Austin , Mister Abagnarro . " And he ran , due west . Fast . Faster than fast . Like he was back in Texas at Memorial Stadium , running for daylight . I stooped and picked up my key ring . " That explains the nickname , " I said . " The universe is sliding into place , all right . Very swell . " Ike was skating in impatient circles in front of Radio Shack , flipping her hands against her sides like she was trying to shake raindrops off , only the sky was clear . Maybe the sparks from Tex 's nerves had leaped across space and danced now in her veins . She stopped circling and gazed at me , her mismatched eyes radi-  | ant in the glow of flickering images from the Radio Shack window , a display of television screens all tuned to Monday Night Football . In a wild fantasy , I imagined I could see the green-uniformed Jets stacking up the aqua-jerseyed Dan Marino , all the action taking place in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy from Tex . " Abby , he created Yellow-Man . Because he could n't bear the thought that his men ' would die unnoticed . " " But Tex did n't create what killed them . " The little skating circles started again , around me , but I found myself pivoting on my wheels so I could watch her eyes as she talked and orbited my space . " For a very scary man , Tex is very scared , " she said . " He 's scared that painting the faces of his men and leaving those cryptic notes on their dead bodies  --  scared that his creation has n't been enough , scared that he 's failed them . " She looked me straight in the eyes . " Abby , he stabbed those men in his frenzy to make someone pay attention . " She made stabbing motions , driving an invisible knife into the palm of her hand , over and over again . " And he 's sick with the knowledge that he 's let them down . They are in Potter 's Field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motions , and she coasted around me as I held her , turning her in a smooth circle . " What Tex created was only a sideshow , " I said , " and now he knows it . The real circus is the New York City bureaucracy , and he has n't got the price of admission . " " And he thinks we do . " She pulled her hand away from mine , stopped skating , and stood looking at the television display filled with images of Monday Night Football . " Abby , do you think he hates us ? " " Yes . " " You and me , personally ? " " No . Yes . I do n't know . " I thought it over and made up my mind and faced Ike in the television sets in Radio Shack 's window . " No . " I turned her gently to face me , tired of looking at reflections . " Remember ? Tex selected me . He thinks I can beat the system . He thought I could beat the system . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system . " " Ike , we are the system . About the best we can do is produce a two-minute spot on that boat ride out to Potter 's Field . Put a nice  | travel feature for paupers on the air . Shit , I do n't even know where Potter 's Field is . How bad can it be , anyway , given the way those men live ? " " I 'm not so sure we 're the system . " She pulled her cell phone from her back pocket . " That 's not what we 're supposed to be . " " We are what we are . " I put my hand over hers before she could open the phone . " Tex is what he is . I ca n't imagine what it takes to paint a corpse and stick a knife into a buddy 's dead body , but I know it does n't take logic or reason . You ca n't appoint yourself undertaker to the homeless and expect the system to stand up and cheer . " Her hand jerked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took , Tex was certainly right about making something out of nothing for those dead men . If he had n't painted them , none of us would ever have questioned their deaths or even have known anything about them . So he 's not a failure . " " Maybe you should have told Tex that . " I released her hand . " Maybe you should have told him to feel good about the media coverage of Yellow-Man so he would n't feel so bad that his men took that boat ride . " She opened the cell phone and dialed a number . I did n't have to watch her fingers to know she was calling the NTB National Desk . " Rich , it 's Ike . Did you try me just now ? " She listened , cocking the phone against her shoulder and stuffing her hands in her back pockets as she started skating toward Broadway . " I 'll look at that when I get in later . Rich , has there been another Yellow-Man killing tonight ? " She listened . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Call me first if you hear anything . I 'm on my cell . " She closed the instrument . " Nothing ? " I asked . " Nothing . " She stuck the phone in her pocket and grabbed my hand again . " Hold my hand . " I looked down at her . " You scared ? " " Bad scared , man . Makes me good at my job . " We skated together and at Broadway made the left for Columbus Circle . The fountain that rings the statue of Christopher Columbus was so full of lights that my eyes smarted . It was like coming out of a bad dream and waking up in Oz . The fountain looked like a moving , flowing Christmas tree , the spray picking up the gold and red  | lights from the traffic through the circle , as well as the green hazy glow cast by the huge doors of the Emerald City . The central statue of Columbus rose on its tall pedestal through the splashing , constantly re-forming limbs of water like the trunk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little secrets . A couple of old and hairy aluminum collectors pushed their rickety mail carts along the sidewalk , stopping to poke around in trash cans , sometimes almost disappearing into the cans as they groped along the bottoms for recyclables . A pair of beat cops passed the collectors and exchanged what seemed to be small talk before they moved on to Central Park South . Nobody was bothering anybody . We were just skating into the circle , a balmy breeze playing with droplets from the fountain , when Ike 's back pocket rang . I thought I knew what that meant . She tugged the instrument out with her right hand and flipped it open , but she raised our linked hands to point at the Emerald City . Standing outside the giant sea-green doors was a lanky and recently bereaved doctor with an interesting face , a doctor who raced cars so he could detect the force of life pulsing through his veins . Ike squeezed my hand , and we skated behind the fountain , putting the frolicking water between us and Aristotle Stefanopolis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone . She did n't have to listen long , probably because she also knew what that call was about as soon as she had heard the faint ringing in her pocket . Her part of the brief dialogue was fairly uncomplicated because , with about nine hours to work with before our show aired , she did n't have to worry about live reporting from the latest Yellow-Man scene . The National Desk would send out crews to get whatever pictures were available . When she closed the instrument , she did n't bother to put it back in her pocket . She was going to have to start making television , and she 'd be on the horn all the way as she skated home to change her clothes . " Guess what ? " she said . I could n't read the look on her face , the mistiness in her eyes . The weird passage of lights through the spray was playing tricks across her face . " Victim number eleven ? " " You 're good at this game , TV Director . Wanta try another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the body found ? " I thought a moment . At first I was just going to say that the latest victim was found somewhere within the area mapped for us by Fred Loring . In fact , I had my mouth open and the first word formed when the real answer hit me : " The ... wait . Tex took off like a homing pigeon , straight for the river , due west . In front of Radio Shack , it was your cell phone ringing that stirred him up . He thought that meant his man had been found . He knew where victim number eleven was because he painted the corpse , just like he knew where the Central Park victim was last night . He knew precisely which of the eighty-six thousand trees to look under . He seems to like to be there when his men 's bodies are discovered . Therefore , this new victim is in the shanties at the end of Fifty-sixth Street , almost due west from Radio Shack . " Ike , shocking the bejesus out of me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and gave me a soft kiss , full on the lips . The light pressure pushed us toward the fountain on our wheels , and the spray was all over us , a fine mist covering our arms and legs and faces like perspiration . " Very good , Sherlock . One more category ? " I locked my arms around her waist . " Yes . " " Who killed number eleven ? " I was blank . As much as I wanted a repeat of the game prize , I was blank . I could n't begin to think . I cleared my throat . " It 's not a fair question if you do n't know the answer yourself , Ike . This is one game we never cheated at . " She pulled away from me . " Tough , " she whispered , but she touched my lips lightly with a finger . She immediately transferred the finger to the buttons on her phone , and I could see that her hand was shaking . She put the phone against her ear and started giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send up a flare for Sally Goldberg-Petit . When she hung up , I pointed through the fountain 's cascading water , around the pedestal of the statue in the center of the water jets , at our place of employment . " Did you play guessing games like that at lunch with Doctor Feel-Alive ? " She gave me that unreadable misty look . " Not like that . " " Does he eat lunch ? Or does he just drink Valvoline ? " " Champagne . "  | " Champagne ? With his brother painted yellow and lying in a city morgue ? " " Gabriel 's was passing it out free because all the customers were wet and miserable . What 'd you want him to drink ? Hemlock ? " " That was Socrates , not Aristotle . I want Aristotle to drink cya-nide . " " Cyanide . " She scratched her chin with the antenna of the phone . " I wish I knew what drug Tex 's men were testing . " " The coroner did n't find anything . " " The coroner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially new , experimental ones . He can only look for standard stuff , and whatever else Fillingeri tells him . " I shrugged my shoulders and nodded toward the doors of the Emerald City . " What 's Aristotle doing here ? " " How should I know ? " " Well , I 'm putting you in a cab and sending you home . I 'll go see why he 's knocking on our door . " " Pooh . Why do n't you get in a cab and go home and take a nap ? You really get surly when you 're short on sleep . " " I get really surly when I 'm short on sex and my former wife almost knocks me into a fountain while she 's kissing me across the street from the man she dated at lunch . " " I did n't almost knock you into the fountain . It was just part of that game , a tiny peck . " " You knocked something . I 'm still tingling . " " Then take a cold shower . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am taking a cold shower . " She took off around the fountain and headed for the doors to the Emerald City . I had a choice : follow her , like a Spanish duenna ; or skate the hell out of there and go home to get some sleep . Through the splashing water I saw the smile on the doctor 's face . Which is what decided me . Why should the NASCAR neurologist have a pleasant evening in Columbus Circle ? That crooked smile on his interesting face had appeared exactly when he spotted Ike skating toward him . I watched his face and his grin through the falling and rising of the water , and I did n't like the image suggested to me by the surging power of the screen of fluid separating me  | from the reunion of the doctor and my wife . I pushed away from the fountain and got the wheels rolling . Aristotle was n't actually touching Ike when I skated up to the giant green doors , but the way he was standing and the way he was looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of metaphysical mode of pawing her . It was n't like he was undressing her in his mind 's eye ; I 've seen plenty of guys do that before . It was more like he did n't need to undress her , that his magic hands and magic eyes had gone beyond the obstacle of clothing ( not that she was overabundantly supplied with any ) to reach the flesh without effort , without permission , in some warm and exciting private region that existed only because he was there beside her . X-ray Man , feeling the life in someone else 's veins. " ... your machine , " he was saying , " and left a couple of messages , but I finally thought I 'd try to catch you here . The guard inside told me , very politely , that I could wait in the lobby , but it 's such a pleasant night . And here you are . " " And here she is , " I said . " And so am I. " Ike gave me a look that told me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said , offering her hand . " Not good , " he said , grasping her hand in that fervent doctorly way that always looks like they can diagnose your kidneys with a quick feel of your palm . " And I 'm afraid that 's what you 're think-ing  --  that I 'm not good . I wanted a chance to salvage my character with you if it is n't too late . The media . The police . Even my patients . They 're all asking . The rumors about me and Hektor 's wife are growing like . . . like ... " " Like cancer ? " I suggested . His eyes flickered over me in the merest casual glance . Not wasting any precious medical energy on diagnosing my kidneys . No bedside manner for the pest . He turned the rheostat of his wide smile up fully for Ike  --  and tenderly , I thought . " I 'll go away if this is bad timing , " he said . And she smiled back . Boy , I thought , he liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hint .  | " That 's nice of you , " I said brightly . " Your offer to go away , I mean . " Aristotle , who was about my height when I am not on blades , had to look up at me to take proper notice of the pest . " You 're in early tonight , Abagnarro . " " Oh . I was n't aware that you followed my schedule . " " I meant that last night you got here much later . " " I 'm like the wind . " I fluttered my left arm by way of illustration , forgetting my scrape from the alley . The resulting sizzle of pain lent an extremely realistic element of spastic randomness to the gesture . " The wind . I come and I go , and nobody can do anything about it . Bus drivers and the FBI hate me , but pollinating trees and sailors worship at my shrine . " Ike 's phone rang and she flipped it open . She put it to her ear and listened . She handed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants to speak with the wind . " I took the phone . " Abagnarro . How are you , Morris ? Getting plenty of rest down there at the Federal Building ? " " Where the hell have you been , Abagnarro ? " " Here and there . I 'm like the wind . I come and I go , impossible to grab hold of . I 'm thinking of starting a religion to myself . " " Yeah ? Well , I 've got some blasphemy all set to go when you 're geared up . " " Can you do that ? I mean , do n't I have to apply for tax-exempt status first or something ? " " Let 's get to cases . Answer my question . Where have you been ? " " All my life ? " " Since you left my office . " " Oh , I never tattle on myself . Ask me about somebody else . " " I can subpoena you , Abagnarro . " " Bless my soul . Just how big is your subpoena ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What man ? " " Lieutenant Raintree . " " Why do n't you ask the losers you had following me ? " " I 'm not going to play any more games with you , Abagnarro . I 'm sending a car for you right now . " " I think the battery must be going on this phone , Morris . It  | sounded like you just said you were going to send a car for me . But t hat ca n't be right . You already tried that and it did n't work . " The line was silent for a moment . I could n't even hear Cainstraight breathing , or grinding his teeth . Ike and Aristotle were gazing politely away at the fountain , obviously eavesdropping . When Cainstraight finally spoke again , I held the phone away from my ear so Ike could listen . His tone sounded like he 'd decided I needed some counseling . " Abagnarro , are you under the impression that you 've got some sort of First Amendment thing going with regard to Lieutenant Raintree ? Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I 'd like to inform you that Lieutenant Raintree is not a source , and , as far as I can find out , you are not a journalist . I checked . " " I 'm not ? " " No . You 're a TV director . " " I just want to be sure I understand what you think here , Cainstraight . Do you think they blindfold the director and plug his ears when they 're putting news on the air ? Do you think that when we interview people on camera and scramble their identities with blue dots and computer voices , do you think the director is sent downstairs to the cafeteria so he ca n't tell what 's going on ? " " I do n't know what a director does . " " You and everybody else . Well , I 'll tell you . On a news program , Cainstraight , the director does journalism . " " This is bullshit . " " My very thought . I 'll say good night now . Why do n't you go read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ca n't find it in the J. Edgar Hoover Library , call me back and I 'll fax you a copy . " I hung up and closed the phone , but it rang immediately . I handed it to Ike without opening it . " It 's for you . " She made a face . " Ike Tygart here . " She made a series of faces and handed me the phone . " It 's Fillingeri . For you . " " Why are they all calling me ? " I demanded . " What 's the National Desk doing up there , patching law enforcement to your cell ? Are they all moonlighting for Ma Bell ? " I took the phone . " Why are you calling me , Captain Fillingeri ? Is this your daily check-in call to see if I 've lied about any muggings in your precinct ? " " Calm down , Abagnarro . I would n't call to check on you about  | anything . I 'm not your shrink or your mother , for which I thank Almighty God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river at Fifty-sixth . Right now . " " Why ? " " Because your network I.D . badge was found on a corpse . We want to know if you know the corpse . " Before I scooted over to the river , I escorted Ike and Aristotle inside the Emerald City to the security desk . I figured that with the word out for me from Fillingeri , and with that word coming from the scene of another spectacular crime , it would n't be long before the Fourth Estate showed up at our door , fanged and looking for hide . As far as I was concerned , they were welcome to Aristotle 's hide , but they certainly would n't be interested in him when they sniffed raw media meat . Newspeople find each other endlessly fascinating , and the merest hint that NTB was making itself newsworthy with regard to Yellow-Man would make assignment desks around New York stink with adrenaline . And , with their smaller fangs , the FBI might not be far behind . I did n't know anything much about subpoena power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how to do things right . He had a fresh killing and a fresh fingerprint , and he knew we had n't ditched his troops solely out of a deep love for our own privacy . Ike and I would be on the hot seat if he could get us there . " The shantytown will be a media carnival , " Ike whispered to me . " How are you going to explain your I.D. ? " I shrugged . " No problem . " I tapped my temple . " Bad I.Q. " She dragged me aside , out of Aristotle 's hearing . " We made a solemn promise to shield Tex . " " Do n't insult me , Ike . I have a bad I.Q. , not a bad memory . " I grinned . " Maybe I 'll also develop laryngitis . " She ran her hands through her hair , tugging her curls hard  | enough to hurt . Aristotle gave her a doctorly glance . But he did n't say anything . When Ike 's upset , she takes it out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some shoving , but the only obvious underling available was Carl Honeyman and he was no challenge . And nobody could take one look at Aristotle and call him an underling . So , in a gruff and businesslike way , she started on me . She thought she had a list of things for me to do and to avoid doing or saying at the shantytown . She started to reel them off before we joined Aristotle and crossed the green marble floor of the lobby , but I stopped her with two words : " Nine feet . " That shut her up . And I wanted her shut up , because I had no wish to discuss the particulars of a Shield Law . It was going to be bad enough to go and hide behind one . " Nine feet , " I repeated unnecessarily , maybe just to hear the sound of my own voice as I practiced saying something unconnected with Yellow-Man or muggers or boat rides . " Nine feet " is shorthand between Ike and me for " I know what I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This particular bit of shorthand got started because I happen to own the distinction of being the NTB News staffer who came the closest ( nine feet ) to embracing one of Saddam Hussein 's not-sosmart Scud missiles during the Gulf War , when I was stationed in Dhahran , Saudi Arabia , so we could anchor Morning Watch from the desert . Nine feet closer , and I would have had a different part in my hair . But we stayed on the air , by God . I lost my Kevlar helmet when I hit the dirt , but my headset stayed on . The only difference the Scud made to me personally , since we were thirty seconds to the end of the show anyway , was that I directed our orderly sign-off with my belly on the sand and my elbows in a huge crack in the ground that had n't been there when we selected the site for the remote . Oh , yeah . I also had to do the count in my head , because my stopwatch was in the huge crack . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller battlefield at the end of West Fifty-sixth , it would only be because I suddenly got real amnesia . When Ike let it sink in that she was trying to preach to the minister , we did n't exchange any more words beyond some strictly workmanlike phrases about the upcoming show . And I held
