Social work practitioners in health and social services are expected to develop and implement programs and client care plans that require cooperation and coordination with numerous other individuals and programs . Such cooperation and coordination often are accomplished through informal networking . As programs develop , these relationships may be formalized in written policy agreements . In this article , the authors examine four policies designed to improve cooperation and coordination at different levels in hospital-based case management systems . Implications for social work practice are discussed . <p> Case management is used in a variety of settings to coordinate the delivery of services for people with functional limitations . This coordinative role is important because so many of the services currently available to elderly and disabled people are fragmented , duplicative , and difficult to access . The case management process includes case finding , assessment , care planning coordinating , follow-up , and reassessment ( Simmons &; White , 1988 ) to ensure the most effective mix of services and to reduce the client 's sense of wandering through a bewildering maze of programs and policies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the profession . In recent years , case management specializations have developed " as social workers have attempted to find ways of coordinating complex services , multiple client problems and long-term care " ( Schilling Schinke , Weatherly , 1988 , p. 5 ) . Geriatric case management program models have developed through area agencies on aging . More recently , hospital-based case management models have been developed to facilitate continuity of care between programs ( Sizemore , Bennett , &; Anderson , 1989 ) . <p> Case managers often must generate and coordinate informal supportive services for clients in the face of limited resources . Because service delivery systems keep changing , such informal networking requires a great deal of time as well as skill and diplomacy . Networking is considered such a critical dimension of social services that not performing this function can be viewed as a " dereliction of duty " ( Fisher , 1983 , p. 50 ) . <p> To reduce the uncertainty of these informal relationships , some case management programs have established formal policies that explicitly define the roles and responsibilities of the major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiences with six hospital-based case management programs in Arizona and New Mexico , the authors discuss cooperative and coordinative policy development and its implications for social work practice . BACKGROUND <p> A growing literature has focused on various aspects of coordination between organizations ( Weiss , 1987 ; Whetten , 1981 ) ; within multi-institutional organizations ( Alexander , 1987 ) ; among networks of service providers ( Ritvo , 1987 ) ; and between professionals on interdisciplinary teams ( Schmitt , Farrell , &; Heinemann , 1988 ) . It is recognized , for example , that hospitals that provide case management services need to clarify their relationships with community-based aging network providers ( Netting &; Williams , 1989 ; Torres , 1988 ) . It is equally important that case managers clarify and define their relationships with discharge planners , behavioral health practitioners , social service staff , and others . <p> For the purpose of this article , cooperation occurs when two or more groups or individuals work toward similar , nonconflicting goals , sharing information but acting independently . Coordination is a higher-order interaction in which two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts mesh smoothly and avoid duplication ( Ellor , 1983 ) . Together , these interactions are important at both the micro and macro levels for any program seeking to provide a diverse set of services ; for a program such as case management , they are critical . Hospital-Based Case Management <p> Hospital diversification into long-term care has been a significant trend in health care . As hospitals diversify , they develop health and social services programs that parallel and overlap those in the community : home health care , visiting-nurse programs , hospices , day care , and case management . These programs may be perceived as spoilers , bringing with them the weight of the large , diversified hospital systems and usurping the role of smaller , established agencies . Hospital-based case management programs with this capability may find themselves moving away from the traditional role of referring clients to community-based organizations for needed services ( Torres , 1988 ) and depending more on the services available within the hospital system . <p> Indeed , Weiss ( 1987 ) noted that there is usually considerable resistance to cooperation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to a number of obstacles to developing mutually beneficial relationships , including the tendency of programs or agencies to seek independence and autonomy , the difficulty inherent in synchronizing organizational routines , overlapping but nonidentical goals , and different constituency pressures and expectations . Weiss cited six theoretical perspectives to explain why agencies elect to develop cooperative relationships despite these obstacles : <p> ( 1 ) a calculation that additional net resources will flow from cooperation , ( 2 ) the professional norms and values of agency staff about cooperation with outside agencies , ( 3 ) search for political advantage over other agencies , ( 4 ) the need to ameliorate internal problems of organizational effectiveness , ( 5 ) the desire to reduce critical uncertainties , and ( 6 ) a legal requirement to cooperate ( p. 95 ) <p> Traditionally , cooperative relationships developed through an informal networking process that evolved as case managers pieced together service packages that would benefit their clients . Although informal relationships are important , they have limitations . For example , many programs with which case managers work have high levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continually building relationships and educating staff who are new to the process . Case Management and Discharge Planning <p> A critical linkage in the hospital is between case managers and discharge planners . Simmons and White ( 1988 ) explained that case management is often misperceived as one form of discharge planning and that " hospital-based case management is in no way intended to be viewed as merely an extension of discharge planning " ( p. 217 ) . Case management is along-term , intensive process with " separate and distinct staff , procedures , and accountability " ( p. 217 ) . <p> The American Hospital Association ( 1984 ) defined discharge planning as an " interdisciplinary hospital-wide process that should be available to aid patients and families in developing a feasible post-hospital plan of care " ( p.3 ) . Discharge planners often feel pressured by prospective payment systems that encourage the acute care hospital to release patients as quickly as possible ( Blumenfield &; Rosenberg , 1988 ; Holden , 1989 ) . <p> Social workers are in a unique position to be aware of these system-wide consequences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and facilitating patients ' transitions from one component of the health care system to another . ( Coulton , 1988 , p. 19 ) <p> The coordination of case management and discharge planning efforts increases the potential for high-quality , cost-effective care ( Collard , Backman , &; Beatrice , 1985 ) . Within the hospital , the discharge planning , social services , and case management staffs need to coordinate their roles . Social workers may perform all these roles , in conjunction with their nursing colleagues . The following is a typical scenario : A social services department identifies an older client who may need long-term in-home care after discharge . It refers the case to hospital-based case managers , who work closely with discharge planners until the older patient is released . On discharge , the case manager assumes responsibility for reassessment , care planning , ongoing monitoring , and evaluation of services . If the older client reenters the hospital , it is noted that she or he is a case management client ; coordination with in-hospital departments is thus resumed until discharge , when the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the relationships and communication between acute care departments must be carefully coordinated . This coordination may be formalized through policies and procedures . <p> Hospital-based case management programs have targeted frail elderly people , clients for whom discharge planners have the most difficulty designing posthospital care . Given the pressures discharge planners face , referring clients to case managers for long-term oversight and care planning resolves the ethical problem posed by releasing a person into an uncertain environment with short-term services . PRACTICE-BASED COOPERATIVE POLICIES <p> An organization 's policies reflect its values and mission . As an organization that depends on cooperation and coordination ages , it moves from informal networking relationships to increasingly formalized policy agreements ; legal contracts represent the extreme formal end of the continuum ( Downs , 1967 ; Wardell , 1988 ) . Flynn ( 1985 ) discussed the importance of policy for the social work practitioner : <p> Policy enacts practice . Policy shapes and delineates what the practitioner does , how he or she relates to the client group , and the manner in which discretion is allowed or exercised . Policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and other resources and , consequently , provides a structure for how one 's professional role is to be carried out . ( pp. 15-16 ) <p> Essentially , the case manager engages in an interactive dance using policies that have been developed to smooth the transitions between units within the service delivery system . If the dance is performed well , the client will not be disrupted as he or she moves between the skilled hands of various departmental dancers . <p> In the six hospital-based case management programs with which the writers are affiliated , formal policies of cooperation and coordination have been established as interface agreements in four areas : ( 1 ) between case management professionals in one program , ( 2 ) between different departments in the same hospital system , ( 3 ) between hospital systems , and ( 4 ) between the hospital and other agencies . Policy A : Cooperation between Professionals within a Program <p> In one program , staff became aware of the potential for duplication or for clients to " fall between the cracks " in their program . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interactive roles for the social work case managers and the nurse consultant . I. Client Referred to Program <p> 1 . After initial screening , referrals are allocated among the case managers . II . Initial Assessment The case manager is responsible for initiating and implementing assessment . Depending on the circumstances , the case manager can assess cases either singly or jointly with the nurse-consultant . As soon-as possible after assessment , the case manager should review all pertinent health areas with the nurse-consultant . The case manager is to authorize office staff to order medical records . The office staff will coordinate such ordering with the nurse-consultant who will be responsible for reviewing the records . After the review , the nurse-consultant will consult with the case manager concerning all pertinent findings , to include but not be limited to DRG , hospital stay , diagnosis , and so on . If no medical record exists , the nurse consultant will seek information from the client 's primary physician or other health professionals . Any health-related goals of care plans will be jointly developed with the nurse-consultant . III @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychological or physical ) should be referred to the nurse-consultant as soon as possible . The nurse-consultant will follow up as appropriate . Upon closure of health concerns , the nurse- consultant will return all pertinent information to the main client file . Even though health concerns will be tracked by the nurse-consultant , the case manager will continue servicing any ongoing social needs . The case manager will notify the nurse-consultant of client admission to a hospital or other health facility . The nurse-consultant will then follow up as appropriate . IV . Case Closure <p> 1 . The nurse-consultant and the case manager will consult on health-related closures . V. Miscellaneous Letters to physicians and referral sources will be signed by both the case manager and the nurse-consultant . The case manager is the primary facilitator for cases within his or her caseload . The nurse-consultant is the primary facilitator for referred health-related cases . It is important to note that staff shares responsibility for all cases to comprehensively serve clients . <p> In designing this policy , the staff informally tracked the case management process from beginning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas in the program where cooperation and coordination were needed , the staff could implement a procedural agreement that ensured smoother working relationships . Policy B : Cooperation between Hospital Departments <p> To resolve a problem of slow retrieval of medical records for clients , one case management program developed an interface agreement with the medical records department . The two departments agreed to the following policy : <p> The case management program agrees to  --  Supply the medical records department with a photocopy of an authorization to release information at the time of service . Provide the medical records manager with a written list of records 48 working hours in advance of the review . Set a time when they will be available to review records in the incompletes . Review records Mondays , Thursdays , and Fridays . Begin reviews no sooner than 4 days after discharge . <p> Medical records agrees to  --  Pull the complete records and have them available within 48 working hours . Let case managers know the records are incomplete . Arrange to have the records available at the agreed time and hold the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> This policy enhances cooperation between the different departments by clarifying expectations and establishing reasonable time frames for departmental activities . Most important , it facilitates the transition of clients through the service delivery system . Policy C : Cooperation across Hospital Systems <p> Two urban hospitals in the same part of a large city recognized the potential for competition between their case management programs . They were also concerned that older clients of a hospital 's case management program might become confused if , after admission to the other hospital in an acute episode , they were referred inappropriately to the second hospital 's program . The policy goal , therefore , was to support clients ' independence through communication and cooperation between the two programs . <p> The sanction of two large multi-institutional systems is a major issue in determining feasibility of this cooperative relationship . Therefore , the agreement must be approved by the legal and management authorities of each hospital system before program directors complete the policy statement . <p> With these steps in mind , the case management programs designed the following policy agreement : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospitalization at Hospital B will not be referred to Hospital B 's case management program . Hospital A case managers will be allowed access to their patients hospitalized in a Hospital B facility after clearance by the appropriate department : <p> Hospital B  --  Patient/Family Services <p> Hospital B Rehab Center  --  Social Services <p> Hospital B West  --  Patient/Family Services <p> Patients receiving case management services from Hospital B who require hospitalization at Hospital A will not be referred to Hospital A 's case management services . Hospital B case managers will be allowed access to their patients hospitalized in a Hospital A facility after clearance by Utilization Management . <p> To prevent duplication of services , both hospitals ' case management systems will provide one another , on a regular basis , with a list of current active patients . The systems will notify one another when patients from one system are hospitalized in the other system 's facilities . <p> This policy ensures that patients will be allowed access to the case management program that is familiar with their case . In addition , it reduces the potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fragmentation that often occur when patients move between two different systems . Policy D : Cooperation with Programs in the Community <p> Social work case managers have traditionally shined in developing informal relationships with other agencies and programs in the community . As hospital programs have grown , the importance of ensuring consistent relationships has moved them toward more formal agreements . <p> One case management program decided to formalize relationships with other agencies in the community . Because the program 's ultimate goal was effective and efficient service delivery to frail elderly persons at risk of institutionalization , mutually beneficial agreements were important to eliminate much of the risk associated with informal networking . <p> The case management program initiated the following policy with a local Meals on Wheels program : <p> The purpose of this agreement is to establish a working relationship between Hospital A and Meals on Wheels . To prevent duplication of services and to develop administrative and programmatic linkages , we mutually agree as follows : To make our staff , volunteers , and clientele aware of the services and resources we each provide . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other 's services as needed . To provide services to clients referred and to share relevant follow-up information about services delivered to clients , within the constraints of our policies of client/patient confidentiality . <p> Although this policy is fairly general , it provides a formal vehicle for coordination to which the staffs of both the hospital-based program and the meals program can refer . IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE <p> Social workers in health care settings often work on interdisciplinary teams . In designing policies that cut across programs within the hospital , social workers need to assess the feasibility of implementation . Feasibility requires that both units agree to cooperate . Legal impediments and cost must be considered . It is also important to consider the actors involved to spot unresolved power issues . Power struggles in small-scale policy implementation are often subtle . Passive resistance , for example , can effectively block the implementation of the most carefully designed policy . However , establishing congruence with the desired values of all parties will facilitate policy implementation . <p> The relationship between social work and nursing staff in case management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To develop workable agreements between departments , the social worker must be aware of the formal chains of command . <p> Although case managers in different hospital systems may be willing to develop a cooperative relationship , implementing such a policy requires assistance from other departments within both hospital systems . These departments may not be accustomed to granting privileges to professionals from other hospitals as readily as to their own . Social workers involved in negotiating agreements between hospital programs should not underestimate the time it will take to educate hospital staff so that everyone is clear about the procedures between facilities and their benefits . Clients usually benefit from a cooperative policy , and staffs benefit from knowing where to refer incoming patients and from knowing where to refer incoming patients and from improved networking between the hospitals . <p> An essential element of case management is monitoring services to make sure they meet client needs . When older clients are referred to other programs in the community , case managers can easily lose track of them without policies and procedures to facilitate staying in touch . Notification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially important . With a frail population , such feedback mechanisms are critical . <p> In addition , hospital-based case management programs that seek funding from foundations or contract with public agencies must demonstrate that they are not duplicating services already existing in the community . Formal relationships provide written documentation for grants or proposal applications and demonstrate that a program has cooperative relationships that enable it to provide an ongoing , comprehensive program . <p> Although the authors have described four seemingly distinct policies , case managers are aware of the mixing and matching of policies and procedures in daily practice . For example , a hospital may have a policy clarifying the interdepartmental relationship between social services and case management ; however , the two departments may have different and potentially conflicting agreements with the same community-based service provider . The social worker at the community-based agency may be hampered by having to relate one way to the hospital social services department and another way to the case management department . <p> Case management deals with long-term care . This is often difficult for acute care professionals to understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Because case management normally does not require immediate action , procedures that affect this program may have lower priority to the acute care professional . Interdepartmental agreements or protocols , therefore , remind other units within the facility that case management performs an important function . <p> In complex systems such as hospitals , where departments and staffs are interdependent , lack of cooperation can cause serious problems . Carefully thought-out and mutually agreed-on policies and procedures can ensure that personality conflicts and competitiveness do not obstruct patient care . In addition , because all hospital-based programs face evaluations on quality assurance that focus on outcome as well as process , policies that facilitate efficiency and effectiveness are in everyone 's interest . <p> Flowcharts can enhance case management by illustrating the critical actors and decision-making junctures in the process and assist in identifying bottlenecks within the hospital and across systems that require policy agreements to facilitate cooperation or coordination . As actors change , case managers must renew the policies . Policy agreements , therefore , are working tools  --  rarely are they finished products . <p>   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
