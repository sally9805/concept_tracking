The subtitle on CNN was suddenly saying Princess Diana dead . And for just an hour or so , it felt like November 1963 . " This will be a fixing moment in your lives , " I intoned to my two sons ( I was thinking , naturally , about her two sons ) . " You will always remember where you were and who you were with when you heard this news . " Princess Diana dead : it seemed brutally inordinate . Because Diana had never been hard news , until then . Diana , in every sense , had always been soft . For once I found myself longing for a euphemism : passed away , perhaps , or succumbed . <P> A sense of proportion would soon return . Or at least it would in my house . The true comparison , of course , is not with Kennedy but with Kennedy 's wife . ( And consider the passive figure of Mr. Zapruder , his shutter innocently open on the grassy knoll , as opposed to the figure of Mr. Rat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one experienced the pity and terror associated with a major loss . You felt stunned from nowhere , as if something had veered in out of your blind spot . <P> That fatal ride has the quality of nightmare . What was it like , being driven by a vainglorious drunk at an insane velocity in an urban tunnel ? With rising claustrophobia , the passenger will sense that a driver 's mind is disorganized  --  that " control " is in the process of being relinquished . And so it was . It makes your shins shudder to imagine the atrocious physics of the impact , as the Mercedes transformed itself into a weapon of blunt force . Next , the swat team of photographers and the final photo shoot . Whether or not the paparazzi helped cause Diana 's death , they undoubtedly defiled its setting . They took pictures of the dying woman . How could they ? But they did . And now the two sons , the princes , face not only the loss of a loving and lovable mother but also a bereavement uniquely contaminated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a moment examine the nature of Diana 's fame . One might call it a collateral celebrity , because it relied on no discernible contribution ( except to the gaiety , and now the grief , of nations ) . Lady Diana Spencer attracted the love of the introverted heir to the English throne . And that was all . Brightness of eye , whiteness of tooth , a colluding smile , a certain transparency , a vividness , an exposed vulnerability : it was enough for him , and it was enough for us . Madonna sings . Grace Kelly acted . Diana simply breathed . She was a social-page figure who became a cover girl . One can soberly assert that the Diana saga , in itself , was a nonstory , remorselessly and fanatically annotated by our own projections and desires . Rather , we are the story . Equipped with no talent , Diana evolved into the most celebrated woman on earth . What does that tell us about the third rock from the sun ?           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
