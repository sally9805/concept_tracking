Handicapped by History // The Process of Hero-making // What passes for identity in America is a series of myths about one 's heroic ancestors . // James Baldwin // One is astonished in the study of history at the recurrence of the idea that evil must be forgotten , distorted , skimmed over . We must not remember that Daniel Webster got drunk but only remember that he was a splendid constitutional lawyer . We must forget that George Washington was a slave owner .. , and simply remember the things we regard as creditable and inspiring . The difficulty , of course , with this philosophy is that history loses its value as an incentive and example ; it paints perfect men and noble nations , but it does not tell the truth . // W. E. B. Du Bois // By idolizing those whom we honor , we do a disservice both to them and to ourselves .... We fail to recognize that we could go and do likewise . // Charles V. Willies // This Chapter is About Heroification , a degenerative process ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Through this process , our educational media turn flesh-and-blood individuals into pious , perfect creatures without conflicts , pain , credibility , or human interest . // Many American history textbooks are studded with biographical vignettes of the very famous ( Land of Promise devotes a box to each president ) and the famous ( The Challenge of Freedom provides " Did You Know ? " boxes about Elizabeth Blackwell , the first woman to graduate from medical school in the United States , and Lorraine Hansberry , author of A Raisin in the Sun , among many others ) . In themselves , vignettes are not a bad idea . They instruct by human example . They show diverse ways that people can make a difference . They allow textbooks to give space to characters such as Blackwell and Hansberry , who relieve what would otherwise be a monolithic parade of white male political leaders . Biographical vignettes also provoke reflection as to our purpose in teaching history : Is Chester A. Arthur more deserving of space than , say , Frank Lloyd Wright ? Who influences us more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domestic architectural spaces , or Arthur , who , urn , signed the first Civil Service Act ? Whose rise to prominence provides more drama - Blackwell 's or George Bush 's ( the latter born with a silver Senate seat in his mouth ) ? The choices are debatable , but surely textbooks should include some people based not only on what they achieved but also on the distance they traversed to achieve it . // We could go on to third- and fourth-guess the list of heroes in textbook pantheons . My concern here , however , is not who gets chosen , but rather what happens to the heroes when they are introduced into our history textbooks and our classrooms . Two twentieth-century Americans provide case studies of heroification : Woodrow Wilson and Helen Keller . Wilson was unarguably an important president , and he receives extensive textbook coverage . Keller , on the other hand , was a " little person " who pushed through no legislation , changed the course of no scientific discipline , declared no war . Only one of the twelve history textbooks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about Keller and often show audiovisual materials or recommend biographies that present her life as exemplary . All this attention ensures that students retain something about both of these historical figures , but they may be no better off for it . Heroification so distorts the lives of Keller and Wilson ( and many others ) that we can not think straight about them . // Teachers have held up Helen Keller , the blind and deaf girl who overcame her physical handicaps , as an inspiration to generations of schoolchildren . Every fifth-grader knows the scene in which Anne Sullivan spells water into young Helen 's hand at the pump . At least a dozen movies and filmstrips have been made on Keller 's life . Each yields its version of the same clichE . A McGraw-Hill educational film concludes : " The gift of Helen Keller and Anne Sullivan to the world is to constantly remind us of the wonder of the world around us and how much we owe those who taught us what it means , for there is no person that is unworthy or incapable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can make us is to help another reach true potential . " // To draw such a bland maxim from the life of Helen Keller , historians and filmmakers have disregarded her actual biography and left out the lessons she specifically asked us to learn from it . Keller , who struggled so valiantly to learn to speak , has been made mute by history . The result is that we really do n't know much about her . // Over the past ten years , I have asked dozens of college students who Helen Keller was and what she did . They all know that she was a blind and deaf girl . Most of them know that she was befriended by a teacher , Anne Sullivan , and learned to read and write and even to speak . Some students can recall rather minute details of Keller 's early life : that she lived in Alabama , that she was unruly and without manners before Sullivan came along , and so forth . A few know that Keller graduated from college . But about what happened next , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A few students venture that Keller became a " public figure " or a " humanitarian , " perhaps on behalf of the blind or deaf . " She wrote , did n't she ? " or " she spoke " - conjectures without content . Keller , who was born in 1880 , graduated from Radcliffe in 1904 and died in 1968 . To ignore the sixty-four years of her adult life or to encapsulate them with the single word humanitarian is to lie by omission . // The truth is that Helen Keller was a radical socialist . She joined the Socialist party of Massachusetts in 1909 . She had become a social radical even before she graduated from Radcliffe , and not , she emphasized , because of any teachings available there . After the Russian Revolution , she sang the praises of the new communist nation : " In the East a new star is risen ! With pain and anguish the old order has given birth to the new , and behold in the East a man-child is born ! Onward , comrades , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the coming dawn ! " Keller hung a red flag over the desk in her study . Gradually she moved to the left of the Socialist party and became a Wobbly , a member of the Industrial Workers of the World ( IWW ) , the syndicalist union persecuted by Woodrow Wilson . // Keller 's commitment to socialism stemmed from her experience as a disabled person and from her sympathy for others with handicaps . She began by working to simplify the alphabet for the blind , but soon came to realize that to deal solely with blindness was to treat symptom , not cause . Through research she learned that blindness was not distributed randomly throughout the population but was concentrated in the lower class . Men who were poor might be blinded in industrial accidents or by inadequate medical care ; poor women who became prostitutes faced the additional danger of syphilitic blindness . Thus Keller learned how the social class system controls people 's opportunities in life , sometimes determining even whether they can see . Keller 's research was not just book-learning : " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could not see it , I could smell it . " // At the time Keller became a socialist , she was one of the most famous women on the planet . She soon became the most notorious . Her conversion to socialism caused a new storm of publicity - this time outraged . Newspapers that had extolled her courage and intelligence now emphasized her handicap . Columnists charged that she had no independent sensory input and was in thrall to those who fed her information . Typical was the editor of the Brooklyn Eagle , who wrote that Keller 's " mistakes spring out of the manifest limitations of her development . " // Keller recalled having met this editor : " At that time the compliments he paid me were so generous that I blush to remember them . But now that I have come out for socialism he reminds me and the public that I am blind and deaf and especially liable to error . I must have shrunk in intelligence during the years since I met him . " She went on , " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defends an intolerable system , a system that is the cause of much of the physical blindness and deafness which we are trying to prevent . " // Keller , who devoted much of her later life to raising funds for the American Foundation for the Blind , never wavered in her belief that our society needed radical change . Having herself fought so hard to speak , she helped found the American Civil Liberties Union to fight for the free speech of others . She sent $100 to the NAACP with a letter of support that appeared in its magazine The Crisis - a radical act for a white person from Alabama in the 1920s . She supported Eugene V. Debs , the Socialist candidate , in each of his campaigns for the presidency . She composed essays on the women 's movement , on politics , on economics . Near the end of her life , she wrote to Elizabeth Gurley Flynn , leader of the American Communist party , who was then languishing in jail , a victim of the McCarthy era : " Loving birthday greetings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring strength and peace into your brave heart ! " // One may not agree with Helen Keller 's positions . Her praise of the USSR now seems na ? ve , embarrassing , to some even treasonous . But she was a radical - a fact few Americans know , because our schooling and our mass media left it out . // What we did not learn about Woodrow Wilson is even more remarkable . When I ask my college students to tell me what they recall about President Wilson , they respond with enthusiasm . They say that Wilson led our country reluctantly into World War I and after the war led the struggle nationally and internationally to establish the League of Nations . They associate Wilson with progressive causes like women 's suffrage . A handful of students recall the Wilson administration 's Palmer Raids against left-wing unions . But my students seldom know or speak about two antidemocratic policies that Wilson carried out : his racial segregation of the federal government and his military interventions in foreign countries . // Under Wilson , the United States intervened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our history . We landed troops in Mexico in 1914 , Haiti in 1915 , the Dominican Republic in 1916 , Mexico again in 1916 ( and nine more times before the end of Wilson 's presidency ) , Cuba in 1917 , and Panama in 1918 . Throughout his administration Wilson maintained forces in Nicaragua , using them to determine Nicaragua 's president and to force passage of a treaty preferential to the United States . // In 1917 Woodrow Wilson took on a major power when he started sending secret monetary aid to the " White " side of the Russian civil war . In the summer of 1918 he authorized a naval blockade of the Soviet Union and sent expeditionary forces to Murmansk , Archangel , and Vladivostok to help overthrow the Russian Revolution . With the blessing of Britain and France , and in a joint command with Japanese soldiers , American forces penetrated westward from Vladivostok to Lake Baikal , supporting Czech and White Russian forces that had declared an anticommunist government headquartered at Omsk . After briefly maintaining front lines as far west as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of 1919 , and our troops finally left Vladivostok on April 1 , 1920. // Few Americans who were not alive at the time know anything about our " unknown war with Russia , " to quote the title of Robert Maddox 's book on this fiasco . Not one of the twelve American history textbooks in my sample even mentions it . Russian history textbooks , on the other hand , give the episode considerable coverage . According to Maddox : " The immediate effect of the intervention was to prolong a bloody civil war , thereby costing thousands of additional lives and wreaking enormous destruction on an already battered society . And there were longer-range implications . Bolshevik leaders had clear proof .. , that the Western powers meant to destroy the Soviet government if given the chance . " // This aggression fueled the suspicions that motivated the Soviets during the Cold War , and until its breakup the Soviet Union continued to claim damages for the invasion . // Wilson 's invasions of Latin America are better known than his Russian adventure . Textbooks do cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ textbook authors attempt to justify these episodes . Any accurate portrayal of the invasions could not possibly show Wilson or the United States in a favorable light . With hindsight we know that Wilson 's interventions in Cuba , the Dominican Republic , Haiti , and Nicaragua set the stage for the dictators Batista , Trujillo , the Duvaliers , and the Somozas , whose legacies still reverberate . Even in the 1910s , most of the invasions were unpopular in this country and provoked a torrent of criticism abroad . By the mid-1920s , Wilson 's successors reversed his policies in Latin America . The authors of history textbooks know this , for a chapter or two after Wilson they laud our " Good Neighbor Policy , " the renunciation of force in Latin America by Presidents Coolidge and Hoover , which was extended by Franklin D. Roosevelt . // Textbooks might ( but do n't ) call Wilson 's Latin American actions a " Bad Neighbor Policy " by comparison . Instead , faced with unpleasantries , textbooks wriggle to get the hero off the hook , as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilson wanted the United States to build friendships with the countries of Latin America . However , he found this difficult .... " Some textbooks blame the invasions on the countries invaded : " Necessity was the mother of armed Caribbean intervention , " states The American Pageant . Land of Promise is vague as to who caused the invasions but seems certain they were not Wilson 's doing : " He soon discovered that because of forces he could not control , his ideas of morality and idealism had to give way to practical action . " Promise goes on to assert Wilson 's innocence : " Thus , though he believed it morally undesirable to send Marines into the Caribbean , he saw no way to avoid it . " This passage is sheer invention . Unlike his secretary of the navy , who later complained that what Wilson " forced me to do in Haiti was a bitter pill for me , " no documentary evidence suggests that Wilson suffered any such qualms about dispatching troops to the Caribbean . // All twelve of the textbooks I surveyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posit that the interventions were not Wilson 's fault . " President Wilson was urged to send military forces into Mexico to protect American investments and to restore law and order , " according to Triumph of the American Nation , whose authors emphasize that the president at first chose not to intervene . //
