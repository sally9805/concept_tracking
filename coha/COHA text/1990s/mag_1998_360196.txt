When most people think of Pete Rozelle , if they think at all of Pete Rozelle , they probably recall a genial fellow with a balding pate and the ready smile of a car salesman who popped up at the end of the Super Bowl . Rozelle was the commissioner of the National Football League , of course , but what did that really mean ? The players played , the coaches coached , the owners owned , the fans stomped and hollered , but what the hell does a commissioner do ? Commission ? <P> Until his death in 1996 , Rozelle was dwarfed in every way by owners , coaches and players , and it was impossible for the viewer innocent of the inner workings of pro sports to view him as much more than a functionary . The hired help . The guy whose job it was to order the stuffed mushrooms for the party after the game . <P> Those a bit closer to the game had another opinion of Rozelle : as a shrewd promoter of his sport . He invented the Super @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first game to two networks ( NBC and CBS ) , which forced them to compete for viewers . He invented ( with ABC Sports chief Roone Arledge ) Monday Night Football , which is the second longest running prime-time show on American television , after 60 Minutes . He exhibited a taste for kitsch and spectacle unrivaled in professional sports . He loved floats and glitter and marching bands . His idea of beauty was a balloon drop . ( He did not , however , like the name Super Bowl . It was coined by the son of Kansas City Chiefs owner Lamar Hunt , whose imagination had been captured by the newly invented Super Ball . ) It is now commonplace for a regular-season football game to attract ratings that surpass the playoff games in other sports . And the reason for that is Pete Rozelle . <P> But there is a third view of Rozelle espoused by those who watched him work : he was an iron-willed tycoon who created the business model for all of professional sports . In addition , he figured out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sports , including the national pastime , baseball . Rozelle recognized that a sporting event was more than a game  --  it was a valuable piece of programming . Such media moguls as Ted Turner and Rupert Murdoch have used that strategy to build entire networks . Rozelle , however , did them one better . In the long-winded discussions about the money sloshing around professional sports , the structure of the businesses receives little attention . But the structure , as designed by Rozelle , has been largely responsible for the money . That structure , in a word , was a cartel . <P> The football league Rozelle inherited in 1960 was a fragmented collection of 12 franchises , each run more or less as a stand-alone business . The squabbling owners faced serious competition from the newly formed American Football League , bankrolled by one of the richest men in America , Lamar Hunt . Rozelle 's first trick , one that Rockefeller would have admired , was to put an end to the unprofitable competition . In 1962 he traveled to Washington and persuaded Congress to grant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anti-Trust Act . The exemption enabled Rozelle to fold the two leagues into a single , albeit fragmented , business .
