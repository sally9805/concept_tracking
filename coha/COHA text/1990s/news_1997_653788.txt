<p> A FEW months ago , James D. Wolfensohn , the wealthy former investment banker who heads the World Bank , stood in a teeming hillside ghetto in Rio de Janeiro , watching people who had never had running water experience the simple pleasure of opening a tap . <p> The World Bank had teamed up with poverty-fighting organizations , the city government , the water company and local residents to install simple sewage and water lines . The project , Mr. Wolfensohn was told , had created a profitable new market for the water company , improved health and freed thousands of women in the community from the crippling daily ritual of dragging buckets of water up from the bottom of the hill . <p> On a global scale , it was a tiny victory for the World Bank , which has had only intermittent success in decades of struggle to bring hope and improved living standards to the world 's poorest nations . But for Mr. Wolfensohn , who has led the much-criticized international agency for two years , it was a moment that brought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unlike many huge development projects that have given the agency a black eye , this one was of a manageable scale , and it made economic sense . It combined private investment with World Bank expertise . It could be replicated elsewhere . And it had the support and involvement not just of governments and other official bodies but also of the people it was trying to help . <p> " I would watch the women turn on the water , and sometimes they would cry , but always it would be with happiness , " Mr. Wolfensohn recounted in one of two long interviews this summer . " I cried , because how can you not ? You see hope in the eyes of people . You see women who had been wracked with arthritis now able to stand up . You feel that as a member of the bank you helped make this happen . " <p> But if his trip to Brazil was heartening , it was no more than a brief interlude in his battle to arrest the bank 's loss of influence , improve its record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flagship of international development agencies . <p> There is more at stake than the World Bank 's reputation . The entire development field , in which the bank is the biggest and most influential player , is under scrutiny as never before , in both rich nations and poor . Critics say the many hundreds of billions of dollars in development aid have failed abysmally in efforts to build foundations for sustainable economic growth in many regions . Even supporters acknowledge that results have been disappointing in too many countries . <p> " Development , particularly in Africa , is the pre-eminent moral challenge facing mankind , and the World Bank 's role has never been more important , " said Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers , a former chief economist at the bank . <p> It is too early for Mr. Wolfensohn 's efforts to have had any significant effect on the bank 's record ; by its own accounting , a third of the projects it backs fail to create any enduring benefits . But through charm , exhortation and occasional bullying , he has clearly focused the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play at a time when official development efforts have been discredited by their own spotty record and are being made increasingly irrelevant by huge pools of private capital flowing into developing nations . <p> What Western democracies once considered third-world countries , battlegrounds against Communism as much as against poverty , are now defined as emerging markets . And the World Bank , long viewed by critics on the left as embodying the worst of colonialist tendencies , is being hammered by critics on the right as a crutch for corrupt and weak-willed governments and as a barrier to the spread of free markets and democratic capitalism . <p> Balancing such countervailing pressures even as he seeks to remake the institution requires something of a high-wire act from Mr. Wolfensohn , and opinions inside and outside the bank vary about whether he can pull it off . <p> " It 's an irrelevant institution trying to find a role in today 's world , " said Ian Vasquez , an economist at the Cato Institute who says the World Bank 's policies too often impede the development of market economies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> But even some of the harshest critics give Mr. Wolfensohn credit for a passionate commitment to the cause of fighting poverty and for forcing some wrenching and needed changes on the bank . <p> " He genuinely wants to make a difference and to make his mark by turning the bank around and making it an institution that effectively tackles poverty , " said Justin Forsyth , the director of Oxfam International , one of the biggest nongovernmental organizations working on development programs around the world . <p> " He 's a breath of fresh air , " Mr. Forsyth said . " The big question mark is whether he can deliver in practice , whether the reality will match the rhetoric . " AFTER just 26 months on the job , Mr. Wolfensohn , 63 , has become the most activist and publicly visible president the institution has had since Robert S. McNamara stepped down in 1981 . A stocky native of Australia with an unruly shock of white hair , Mr. Wolfensohn comes from a background that defies easy categorization . <p> He made a fortune on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private jet and a lavish vacation home in Jackson Hole , Wyo . Yet he talks of a deep sense of compassion for the poor that is rooted in his family 's financial woes during his childhood . He spent a career advising many of the world 's most unapologetic capitalists , but built a long record of involvement in social , environmental and philanthropic causes . Erudite and tireless , he can also be impatient and thin-skinned when things do n't go his way , colleagues say . <p> Without question , he has managed to give the bank 's culture a jolt . He has encouraged top officials to move from Washington to the countries they are responsible for helping . He is requiring hundreds of senior managers to go through several weeks of business-school-style courses on how companies that fail to adapt to change tend to land on the ash heap of history . The courses are followed by a week 's stay in a poor village or slum to reinforce what the bank 's efforts are all about . <p> As many as 700 people , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose their jobs in a continuing reorganization intended to make the agency more nimble and efficient . And Mr. Wolfensohn has made clear that advancement at the bank will no longer be based on success in getting loans approved by the board , but by the long-term success of loan programs in improving living standards . <p> Mr. Wolfensohn has also begun laying out a vision for the bank that calls for it to shed its somewhat arrogant self-image as the center of the development world . He wants the bank to see itself as a facilitator and partner  --  with governments , with other development agencies , with grass-roots groups and other nongovernmental organizations and , perhaps most important , with the companies , investors and other sources of private capital that have transformed Asia and Latin America and are doing so to varying degrees elsewhere in the world . <p> As an international financier , Mr. Wolfensohn starts with the assumption that the bank should encourage foreign investment . <p> In 1990 , official development assistance from all sources totaled $56.3 billion , compared with $44.4 billion in private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private capital flows had swollen to $243.8 billion  --  nearly a sixfold increase  --  while official development aid had dropped to $40.8 billion , almost half of it from the World Bank . <p> " It stands to reason that if our money is limited and there is great potential for the private sector , we must think in terms not just of what we do but how we can leverage what we do with the private sector , " Mr. Wolfensohn said . <p> BUT his faith in markets has its limits . He is quick to note that three-quarters of the private capital flowing to developing nations goes to a dozen countries , with nearly a quarter going to China alone , leaving vast regions of the world untouched . <p> Moreover , private capital does little to address issues like health and education . And private investment tends to flow mostly to countries that have used development aid and expertise to build not just basic public works like roads and electrical systems but also sound economic policies and stable institutions like courts and banking systems . <p> So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in continuing to finance the infrastructure projects that have been its trademark , he is eager to speed its shift toward weaving an economic fabric for a country through smaller-scale but integrated programs that are economically sustainable , environmentally benign and embraced by those people they purport to help . <p> In the past , the prototypical project required much of the bank 's money and technical expertise  --  say , a hydroelectric dam or other concrete artifact of modernization . In some cases , those projects brought measurable improvements in standards of living , but often they wreaked environmental havoc and proved to be economic boondoggles . <p> These days , the bank has a big program under way to forgive some debts that poor countries ran up with the encouragement or approval of international aid agencies , including the bank itself . And a typical bank project might be the $12.8 million loan it made last year to Kenya to clean up Lake Victoria and help the fishing and farming communities on its shores . Or the $16.8 million loan to the former Soviet republic of Moldova to train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help Ecuador change its judicial system . Or the $4.7 million irrigation program for small farmers in Mali . <p> " The issue in the old days was getting projects done , " Mr. Wolfensohn said . " Getting individual projects done today , unless you scale them up , is not going to solve the problems of poverty and inequality and social justice . <p> " You can help people make crops grow . But if you do n't have roads to get them out , microcredits to finance them , facilities to store them and advice on marketing , then improving crop yields is not going to affect the national scene . " <p> WORLD BANK presidents since Mr. McNamara , the former Secretary of Defense who took over in 1968 , have tried to respond to criticism about the institution 's approach . <p> But none came into office with the sense of urgency that greeted Mr. Wolfensohn two years ago . A new Republican majority in Congress was attacking foreign aid in general . And to mark the anniversary of the founding of the bank and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the world had mounted a long campaign proclaiming that " 50 years is enough " for the two institutions , or at least for the policies they represented . <p> The bank 's shift in emphasis from lending for big infrastructure projects toward social and environmental programs had begun some years earlier . But Mr. Wolfensohn has sought to accelerate and expand the bank 's metamorphosis . One of his main efforts has been to reach out to the hundreds of environmental , human rights and poverty-fighting organizations that have long worked alongside the bank and been among its fiercest critics . <p> Mr. Wolfensohn has urged his managers to include the organizations in any projects where they may be helpful . The World Wildlife Fund , for example , is helping the bank develop an approach to forest management . And a coalition of more than 500 organizations has agreed to join an 18-month program to assess the effectiveness of the bank 's policies in seven nations . <p> MR . WOLFENSOHN has also tried to respond to criticism from poor nations that the bank too often imposes solutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by its policies . Confronted with complaints last year from African officials about the bank 's approach , Mr. Wolfensohn told them to come up with their own ideas . They brought him a plan that is now serving as the blueprint for many of the bank 's activities . <p> " They said that all we did was bring in foreign advisers , pay them enormous amounts of money , drive around in Land Rovers , give technical assistance and then leave , " Mr. Wolfensohn said . <p> With the Africans ' own report now guiding policy , " it 's very clear whose program this is now , " he continued . " They will never be able to say we came up with the wrong program  --  and there 's every chance they came up with the right program . " <p> Many outsiders , though , believe that Mr. Wolfensohn is only modifying the bank 's policies around the edges . Doug Hellinger , who heads the Development Group for Alternative Policies , a consortium of nongovernmental organizations , said Mr. Wolfensohn , perhaps constrained by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained too wedded to the idea that globalization will bring prosperity to poor workers and farmers around the world . Current bank policies , he said , will exploit the most vulnerable around the world , leading to a downward spiral in living standards and working conditions . <p> " He has a personality that can help force change , but the strategy he 's pursuing is not going to work , " Mr. Hellinger said . " It 's going to be an opportunity wasted . It 's a shame . " <p> IN many ways , Mr. Wolfensohn has been training for this job his entire life . Born in Sydney to parents who had emigrated from Britain , he grew up in a home without much money but in an atmosphere that encouraged a love for music and the arts and that instilled in him a drive for accomplishment and security . <p> Encouraged by some friends while in college to take up fencing , he pushed hard enough to make the Australian Olympic team within a few years . After receiving a law degree and being chided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he went off to Harvard Business School and received an M.B.A . in 1959 . <p> After rising through a number of Australian and British investment banks , he landed at Salomon Brothers in New York in 1977 . Within a few years he had come to national prominence by helping to engineer the bailout of the Chrysler Corporation . He had also indulged his passion for classical music , taking up the cello and becoming chairman of Carnegie Hall . In addition , he became a trustee of the Population Council and the Rockefeller Foundation and traveled to one of the first worldwide environmental conferences . <p> In 1980 , hearing that Mr. McNamara had included him on a list of possible successors for the World Bank presidency  --  a job that traditionally goes to an American on the recommendation of the President  --  Mr. Wolfensohn quickly became an American citizen . <p> He did not get the job that time around . Instead , he left Salomon to found his own firm so that he would have more freedom to pursue outside interests . The firm , James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profits into charitable causes , became one of the hottest mergers-and-acquisitions advisers of the 1980 's and early 90 's . ( It is now part of Bankers Trust . ) <p> When President Clinton offered him the World Bank job , he never hesitated , and for all the frustrations and intense criticism he has faced , he says the job is all he hoped for . <p> " I have had terrible times and I still have them , and I wander out of here some days wondering why I 'm not in Jackson Hole , fishing , " Mr. Wolfensohn said . " But it does n't last very long . I have a passionate belief in this organization . We can make a difference between peace and war . We can make a difference between poverty and a fair life for people . <p> " I 'm not saying we can solve all the problems , but we can make a difference , " he said . " You may think that 's stupid , but it 's why I 'm here . " Billions to Lend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tellers , cash machines or checking accounts , and it does not offer mortgages or car loans . <p> Instead , through several subsidiaries , it channels about $20 billion a year in loans and a limited amount of investment capital into projects around the world . <p> One unit , the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development , which is self-financing , raises money by issuing bonds backed by 180 member nations . It then lends the money to the governments of nations that , while poor , are capable of repaying the loans at near-market interest rates that yield a profit for the bank . <p> The poorest of nations are offered long-term , interest-free loans through another subsidiary , the International Development Association . Since these loans are unprofitable , they require financing from rich nations . This year , the United States contributed $700 million to the subsidiary , although conservative Republicans disputed the value of such assistance . <p> Another unit , the International Finance Corporation , makes relatively small equity investments in business ventures to foster entrepreneurship and job creation . <p> And through yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World Bank helps encourage private investment in developing countries by issuing loan guarantees , protecting investors against political risks like war and expropriation .
