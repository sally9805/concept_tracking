Section : SOCIETY EDUCATION After a difficult year , BU is still trying to save the schools of Chelsea <p> Ted Sharp , assistant dean of Boston University 's School of Education , was a long way from the ivory tower when he arrived last year at the Burke Elementary School in Chelsea , Mass . The school sits on the edge of an urban wasteland , in the shadow of the hulking green expressway that connects tiny Chelsea to Boston . And on this day , the opening of school , windblown trash lined the schoolyard 's metal fence . " I can tell you one thing , " Sharp said , kicking at the garbage . " We 're going to get this mess cleaned up . " <p> Good to his word , the trash is gone . But as Chelsea opened its schools last week for the second year in what is arguably the most dramatic experiment in American education-the private takeover of one city 's public schools by a major university  --  that 's the only mess that proved easy to clean up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greer , dean of BU 's education school , " that we did n't realize how tough it was going to be . " <p> In theory , it all seemed so clear . The poorest and perhaps worst school district in Massachusetts admits its failure and turns over its district  --  broken locks , paltry stock and empty barrels  --  to the can-do men ofacademia . With a clear purpose and a 10-year.contract , BU moves swiftly and boldly , establishes a womb-to-tomb educational system and becomes nothing less than a light to the nation . <p> It has n't happened yet . BU made its deal with the local school committee and then found itself battling lawsuits from the teachers ' union and local Hispanic parents . BU knew Chelsea could n't afford many educational luxuries but then watched in horror as the locals cut the already inadequate school budget . After a heavily publicized send-off , BU 's controversial president , John Silber , went looking for foundation funding and found that in those deep pockets there was n't even chump change for his vision . <p> For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , attending meetings and regularly interviewing key participants . This report is the start of a closely observed study of how education reform is accomplished-if it can be accomplished-and , for the first year at least , has been a view of the boardroom and courtroom , not the classroom . The process has proven slow and incremental ; the white knights have found that their spades are as useful as their lances . <p> In the first year BU managed to appoint an outstanding new school superintendent only after withstanding a political backlash in a community where patronage was more important than any one of the three R 's . BU bought computers , wrote curricula , set up alternative high-school programs , started an adult-literacy campaign and built bridges to immigrant groups more used to neglect and failure . " Do n't ask us to show you anything for five years , " the always combative Silber says . " It took them about 30 years to mess up the system . Who says we can correct it in three or four ? " <p> Chelsea ( population : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generations of successful Italian , Irish and Jewish immigrant communities . Horatio Alger graduated from Chelsea High some 140 years ago . But there are few modern-day Horatio Alger stories read or lived there today . Over the last 60 years , the population has shrunk by half , fleeing along with the city 's once strong industrial base . What 's left is a litany of underclass woes . Chelsea is the state 's poorest community . More than 60 percent of its population is minority , principally Hispanic and Asian ; a majority of the children speak English as a second language . Only about a dozen seniors even take college entrance exams . The dropout rate exceeds 50 percent , and its teenage pregnancy rate is one of the highest in Massachusetts . The newest school was built 67 years ago . " Quite frankly I find our problems insurmountable , " said former Chelsea School Committee chairman Bruce Robinson . " We believe BU is the only hope . " <p> That notion did n't originate in Chelsea but with Silber , who had proposed his university @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several years ago . When Boston balked , Chelsea , which borders Boston just to the north , invited the university in . " The wonderful thing about Chelsea , " Silber said , " is that it is small enough to reach our arms around . " Critics called it a stranglehold . The school board gave the university a 10-year contract to run the schools and . relinquished virtually all powers  --  except the power to fire BU . <p> " I do n't want to be an ass or grandiose , " Silber told NEwsWEEK just before school opened last year , " but I do n't think it 's utterly fanciful to say we 're testing the future viability of American primary and secondary education . " Also , the viability and utility of America 's schools of education . He did n't think much of them to begin with and , he 'd wonder aloud , if they could n't run a local school district the way a medical school managed a teaching hospital , who needs them ? Silber turned the project over to Greer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William Bennett 's U.S. Department of Education . They were not naifs . " I 'm not sure anything could have prepared us for the level of cynicism and despair , " says Greer . By sheer willpower they set out to overcome the resistance : Chelsea 's problems  --  despite countless community meetings  --  would be solved from the top down . Sharp explains the strategy bluntly : " We 've been suffocated by wonderful people in education . Give me a few bastards who know what they 're doing . " <p> The cornerstone of BU 's Chelsea program was to be three years of preschool for every child and day care for any infant that required it . Silber himself had set one standard of judgment ; he insisted that BU would raise $3 million for Chelsea and get started on the preschool program the first year . BU fell about a million short . This year kindergarten will be extended to a full school day and a pilot Early Learning Center will handle 154 youngsters from 7:30 a.m. to 6 p.m . But the full preschool program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preschool program , the deans concede , Chelsea is unlikely to become a national model ; in fact , though no one at BU ever suggested this publicly , it might not warrant 10 years of the university 's full-time attention . " If we 're not going to be able to get those kids from birth through five years old , " said Sharp , " we 're just treading water . That 's where you break the cycle . " Still , BU balked at bank-rolling  --  at an estimated cost of a whopping $7 million  --  that critical program . " We 've shown our commitment , " says Greet . " Now 's the time for others to show theirs . " Silber was supposed to raise the big bucks . The BU president had developed a national reputation and , despite roots as a Texas Democrat , had chose ties with the Reagan-Bush Republicans . ( Bush spoke at BU 's 1989 commencement . ) Talk , however , was no substitute for money . A few corporations like Raytheon made grants , but the big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent millions on a blueprint for education reform , turn down a real-life effort , Silber fumed ? How could the Rockefeller Foundation , which once tried to feed India , reject " Chelsea " as " too big " ? <p> Peter Goldmark , president of the Rockefeller Foundation , said it turned down BU because the huge costs of the project made it very difficult to replicate . " One of the central questions for us , " he said , " is if it works , will it go elsewhere ? " Silber , who had been flirting with a run for governor , had said he would n't be a candidate in order to devote his energies to Chelsea . In January , he announced his candidacy ; Silber had , in effect , become an absentee father , busy raising funds for himself ' . <p> Silber had conceived his takeover at the height of the " Massachusetts miracle . " By the time it occurred , the miracle was how fast the economy had plummeted . The city 's first school-budget proposal was even lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BU 's request ; it would have lopped as many as 100 teachers off the payroll and jeopardized $1.8 million in state funds . Suddenly the money BU could raise was needed just to maintain the status quo . The university was frustrated by Chelsea 's refusal to make a financial commitment to its schools . Chelsea spent about 20 percent of its tax revenues on education ; statewide , the average city expenditure is 31 percent . A letter to the local paper seemed to embody the Chelsea attitude : " I was under the impression that you were going to bring in the money , not have us raise it , " wrote an angry taxpayer . <p> Beside the money woes was the other major plague , politics : small-town politics , racial politics , union politics and university politics . Every significant step , in fact almost every insignificant step , was taken across a political minefield . Before the school year even opened , the Chelsea project was saddled with two lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of the takeover , one filed by the teachers ' union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( The suits are still pending . ) " We 're going to war , " proclaimed then union leader Donald Menzies . " You do n't need to sell out to the first bidder . " <p> The irony was not lost on the university that these two BU adversaries were hardly flourishing in the old Chelsea system . The teachers , among the lowest paid in the state , were working without a contract andfaced major layoffs . BU prevented the layoffs and delivered a 5 percent bonus to teachers at the start of the school year . Despite Silber 's reputation as a union buster , BU and union negotiators , backed by the American Federation of Teachers , agreed on a new three-year deal . <p> But the membership , wary of new review procedures for teachers who had previously performed without formal evaluations , rejected the deal . The teachers , Greer learned , were suspicious of everything BU did ; they saw everything , he says , as " a scam . " With time , however , a gust of perestroika reached the faculty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been established and a 45-member teachers ' board was meeting regularly with the superintendent . In one new venture , all but one of the kindergarten and first-grade teachers had volunteered to visit model programs around the Boston area . On the next-to-last day of school , the teachers approved a new three-year contract . " Division is n't helping us , " says Mike Heichman , the union vice president . " The common ground we stand upon to improve public education ... is greater than any differences that separate us . " <p> Slowly , the community at large absorbed that message , too . In August 1989 , after BU bought out the contract of Chelsea 's veteran school superintendent , Greer invited community representatives to participate in the search for a replacement . The choice came down to three candidates , two of whom , BU believed , would be exceptional . The locals voted overwhelmingly for the third . When BU ignored its counsel , the Chelsea contingent was irate . Soon even BU 's critics would agree that the choice of Diana Lam , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But only a few weeks into the BU era , Greer could be heard lamenting , " I 'm spending my whole life doing damage control . " <p> He had particular problems with Chelsea 's Hispanic community . Local leaders were slow to embrace BU . Their distrust of BU was likely exacerbated by Silber 's longstanding and vocal distaste for bilingual education . Greer was exhausted by ceaseless demands for him to appear at community functions . " I could go to 10 events and if I missed the 11th , it was a cause celebre , " he said . <p> Angel Meza , of the Chelsea Commission on Hispanic Affairs , says the university " lacks respect " for the Hispanic community and makes no serious outreach effort . " We do n't want BU to go away , but we want this to be a partnership , not a dictatorship , " he says . Greer , however , is convinced that what Hispanic parents feel about BU might not be the same as " what two or three leaders ' and their lawyers feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the system . And she began phasing out a tracking system that grouped most of the Hispanic children together , in classes that tended to be less stimulating even by Chelsea 's dim standards . Now , all students will follow an academic curriculum and will be grouped heterogeneously . ( There had been heavy gender tracking as well ; a business course for girls entitled " Charm and Personality " has been eliminated . ) <p> Greer 's efforts at appeasing the community were n't helped by Silber 's nascent political campaign . If he was n't remarking on how it was generous welfare benefits that attracted so many Cambodians to the state , he was urging an end to welfare benefits for unwed mothers who have more children . Still , his offenses paled next to the clumsy actions of Jon Westling , Silber 's choice as BU 's acting president . Westling 's letter to superintendent Lam chastising her for praising Nelson Mandela to Chelsea eighth graders made front-page news in Boston . " Nelson Mandela is not someone who should be held up as an heroic example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrown in his lot with killers , " he wrote of the man who soon after would be given a hero 's welcome by the entire city of Boston . <p> Westling was just one more frustration for Lam . Despite pursuing a regimen of coffees with any and every group , and corresponding with parents in English , Spanish , Vietnamese and Khmer , Lam was hearing a constant refrain demanding consultation on every issue and change . " Everyone simply ca n't be involved in everything , " Lam said . She was already working 12-to 16-hour days , which left her communicating with her two young children at home by note , yet making very little headway where it counted  --  in the classrooms . Lam even began teaching a third-grade class once a week , hoping to inspire by example . " I 've got to be more patient , " she kept telling herself . " What I see as going too slow , the people in Chelsea view as moving too fast . " <p> Greer and Sharp , though , were n't convinced it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do , they believed , was to break through the local resistance to any change . Sharp called his critics the " ain't-it-awful crowd , " and they seemed to howl at everypolicy or personnel shift , major or minor . A dramatic example came at midyear when Chelsea implemented alternative after-school and weekend courses . The courses  --  some 17 such as " Johnny Tre-main and Exploring Boston , " which included a Freedom Trail field trip  --  offered credit for attending . The teachers ' union blasted this " charade " that rewarded students " just for warming seats . " Greer defended the new program as an option to a system that was n't working . " When you have 490 out of 1,050 students flunking two or more courses , " he said , " you just do n't blame the students . " <p> Many of the critics , though , prefer to blame the university . Anthony Tiro , chairman of the Chelsea School Committee , says BU always seems to know better than the locals . " There 's a big difference sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the community , " he says . Elizabeth McBride , another school committee member , echoes that concern  --  and says that while the university may know education , it knows nothing about public relations . " Unless they change and stop looking down at the people of the community , " she said , " they 're going to have big problems . " Moreover , McBride says , the city never really understood how comprehensive BU 's approach would be  --  in areas like prenatal care , drug abuse and day care . " A lot of folks here think they 're not just trying to run the schools , " she said , " they 're trying to run the city . " <p> Greer was more than willing to blame himself for at least some of the disenchantment . He did n't always have the time to follow up his own initiatives . The BU-Chelsea experiment was among thehottest topics in education circles . Greer was inundated with calls , correspondence and invitations to speak . As he headed off . to Puerto Rico for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innovations in education so often went awry . " They 're wonderful in the beginning , ? he mused . " Then everyone in charge heads off on their speaking tours . " or all the confusion , contention and contretemps that marked the year , there was significant change and achievement in Chelsea . BU brought $800,000 worth of computer hardware and software into the system for use in both office and class-room , reintroduced the concept of professsional development for teachers , involved a few hundred BU tutors with Chelsea students , divided the high school into three separate " schools within schools " and developed a plan for a health clinic there . Its Intergenera-tional Literacy Project taught 66 adults how to read and , in turn , how to teach their own children . Other successes were smaller , from the Chelsea football players suiting up for a BU home game to the college fraternity that adopted an elementary school . The good will engendered by these lesser efforts was not lost on Greer . " When we came up with three quarters of a million in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing , " he says . " But when we raised $1,500 to send seven students to tour Congress , people were coming up to me saying , ' Heard what you did . Great , really great ! ' " <p> The first year is over and BU finally has Chelsea 's most familiar weapon on its side : inertia . The transition has been made , and there is tremendous reluctance to abort the experiment and put the city through another huge upheaval . Expectations have been lowered a bit . Everyone realizes that no quick fixes are in the offing . While Silber is still an underdog , should he find himself in the statehouse next November , as governor he could pump funds into Chelsea 's experiment . If he loses and returns to BU , he will undoubtedly go back to raising money  --  he 's never been known as a quitter . So stay tuned . How far can BU take the system ? Will the community go along or resist more bitterly ? How many students will be saved ? " This is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Silber . And the real world , as he knows all too well , is full of surprises . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Black pride : Chelsea 's first African-American History Month <p> PHOTOS ( COLOR ) : Bold visions : Silber ( below ) with Chelsea pupils , two kindergarten children examine a snail ( right ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : First home for immigrants : Developmental screenin of 5-year-old Malessa Peuo <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Bringing reforms from the top down : Sharp ( left ) and Greer <p> BY MARK STARR <p> LONG ODDS <p> Chelsea is small , very diverse and full of problems . <p> Population : 26,000 . <p> Average family income : $10,000 . <p> Student body : 3,560. 55% Hispanic , 28% white , 12% Asian and 5% black .
