IT WAS A SWEET LITTLE GANG we had formed : Lilac , Jaws , Bow Scalapendra , and I , Rogulya ( " Cuckold , " that is ) or Rygulya ( that is , " Belcher " ) , depending on the circumstances . <p> Every year we drag ourselves to the Reeds , where we meet up at the end of summer and stick together until the beginning of protracted autumn rains . We then disperse all over the Great Expanse until the next summer season . We do n't discuss our previous whereabouts . It just is n't done among us . It might actually be unsafe . It 's a rule in our midst to yield only to those reminiscences that take us back five years or more . " When the guano has mineralized , " Jaws explained on one occasion . The rest of us agreed with him . <p> Why are we drawn to the Reeds of all places , and why every year ? Why not an Alpine cave ? Why not a salt mine ? Or catacombs ? Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , only the Reeds . The Baltic shores . Under a northern August sky . We stick around here until the tall blue globe of the sky grows dim and deflates , scratched by a stray cat of inevitability . We enjoy the metamorphosis of summer 's beauty into the ugliness of the fall . And we do n't suffer as much from our troubles as during the rest of the year . Premature rainfall , early mud , and the sweet longing of rotting roots of reeds make us feel content . We 're not alone . It happens to others , too . All expires . <p> A little way off from the Reeds , sunbathers lie on yellow sand browning their bodies . They lick ice-cream cones . And wallop each other with plastic balls . The wash off their sweat and sloth in the Gulf of Chukhonia . We never join them on the Beach . And we also never let anybody come near us . Scalapendra took care of that three years ago . I can still remember clearly one of the sunbathers , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wild pig . And then the wail of the ambulance siren . Ever since that incident , a clear line of demarcation has separated the Reeds from the rest of the shore . <p> When we arrive in the morning-crawling , walking or running to the Reeds from our night shelters-the sunbathers shiver and wrap themselves in their striped Beach towels or brightcolored bathrobes . They do n't want to be seen by us . <p> And only the Castle , glowing white atop the Hill , makes us uneasy . We sit in the Reeds and chit-chat . Frequently , we talk about legends of remote past . Sometimes we slink to the shore down a wet trail . And we never look towards the Beach . The Castle hovers over the shore like a huge white cliff , ready to break off . We have a feud going on with the Castle . We detest the Castle ; the sunbathers fear it . In the Castle they despise both us and the sunbathers . Though even their contempt has different shades . The Masters of the Castle see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as worthless and tolerable . <p> Our little gang was formed between nine and twelve years ago . It 's hard to find a society consisting of more dissimilar members . For instance , take Scalapendra . I knew I would start with her . But I ca n't help it , she 's my old affection . My femme fatale , poisoned by love potion . And yet I 'm going to step on my throat . I 'll overpower myself and leave the description of Scalapendra until a better occasion . Let me start with Lilac . First , his portrait . A verbal portrait . A pitiful semblance of the truth . Lilac is always first to show up in the Reeds . He is first to reach the town of Chukhonsk . He rents the cheapest basement , which he playfully calls bel etage . The bel part comes out with particular tenderness in his pronunciation . He sings it out with his dirty lips . Three erotic letters : B - E - L. Actually , he relishes the " zh " in etage nearly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spits out : " You flamboyant queen ! " <p> I seem to have digressed a bit . Lilac is famous for the extraordinary ramifications of his veins . He seems to breathe with his skin . Like a frog . A lilac , humanoid frog . But he not only breathes with his skin . Lilac eats with his skin . His lilac capillaries absorb odors . Plenty of culinary and restroom facilities have remained in Chukhonsk since the times of . . . I think you know which times . " Money likes more money , " was Jaws 's favorite word of wisdom . <p> Prior to the formation of our society , our little gang , our brotherhood of the Reeds , Lilac ( who was back then perfectly colorless ) once drank a whole bottle of varnish . They revived him at intensive care . But his skin acquired a permanent coloring . During a census of the Great Expanse they did n't know how to classify him . Like a stray , Lilac joined us some five years ago , having roamed to Europe from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environs of Chita , making a living around pool tables in the evenings . There is a famous pool saloon in Chita . A ball would jump the cushion , and Lilac would pick it up . Chalk would crumble , he would get a fresh piece from his pocket . An empty bottle would rumble down the floor , Lilac would hide it in his bosom . People felt sorry for Lilac . He never knew his mother . Around 1937 , he was found lying on a porch of a camp ward wrapped in rags . Why did he choose Chukhonsk ? Why did he seek our company ? And we-what about the rest of us ? Why did we take Lilac in ? Actually Lilac followed Bow . Bow came after Jaws . Jaws was trying to catch up with Scalapendra . And I saved Scalapendra from the Castle . Yes , I , Rogulya the Cuckold or Rygulya the Belcher , depending on the circumstances . So in the end , it 's no one 's fault . One follows the other , men or woman alike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find a historical precedent . But it 's neither fate nor precedent . Attraction . Hemotaxis . Something like a magnetic field . A purple needle pointing to the North . Bow drifted here from the North . <p> But first let me tell you about Jaws . Although I really should talk about Scalapendra . She is the one , of whom they say : cherchez la femme . She 's the cause of it all . She is Pen . And also Scala . And La , in cheerful moments . Jaws made up all these abbreviations for the woman I saved . My ex-wife . I 've let go of many memories , but not this one . Swamps . Putrefaction . Food take-outs . Public restrooms . Basements . Perspiration . I just could n't get over her . Nor could I drive her away . The others would n't let me . After all , she 's La . And femme . <p> The biography of Jaws is very confusing . Itineraries of a traveling circus . Intricate patterns of lichens . A beehive 's trajectory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chews you up ) , Golden Jaws ( i.e. a champion ) , Mighty Jaws ( i.e. he lifts you up ) , Terrifying Jaws ( i.e. he gnashes ) , Kino Jaws ( i.e. he 's worked in animated cartoons ) , and Musical Jaws ( i.e. he can tap out different beats ) . Having performed his tricks with the circus for eleven months each year , Jaws heads for Chukhonsk and surfaces in our Reeds . He stays in Fisherman 's House , and on business days he shows his tricks to groups of sunbathers . After the falling-out between Pen and Rogulya ( that is , me ) over the scandal at the Castle , Jaws became even more smitten with passion for Scalapendra , but also more cautious . He kept repeating : " Better beware than get a sudden scare . " As for me , I no longer care . I 've lost attraction to her . I would 've quit the Reeds altogether had it not been for the main secret . Which is not to say that I do n't feel sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passion for architecture is costing me dear . The devilish Castle ! No , not a mere block of white stone . A ship waiting pensively at bay . Built high up over the Reeds , this ship would have to cut across the Reeds to go out into the sea . That 's a clever design . With extra options just in case . Think about it : now it stands atop the hill like a Castle , and now it leaps off across the Reeds into the Baltic Sea . Grand architecture ! Mysterious design . And now take a look at Scalapendra . Redhaired , even her eye lashes the color of dark gold . Like little reeds . And even her armpits are filled with gold . And all the rest . A lioness with innocently blue eyes under black eyebrows . I do n't know where Pen hides her sting . But I can testify that she is poisonous . She once stung Jaws . She also stung someone from the Castle . And she stung me . In that case Rogulya- " Cuckold " - that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different dosages : luring , terrifying , and lethal . Jaws got the luring dosage . The terrifying dosage was applied to the blacktailed woman from the Beach . As for lethal . . . One hears various rumors . It 's dangerous to take heed . " When the guano has mineralized , " Jaws used to say . <p> Bow . . . You 'd think we called him " Bow " because of his violin ? Of course he plays the violin . A boy from a good family . The Music School of Solomon Katz . No , I beg your pardon , a different school . The one where both Busya Goldshtein and Dodya Oystrakh studied . Our Bow was educated like other wunderkinds from Deribasovskaya Street in Odessa . But he wanted an easy life for himself . He found a different application for his fiddle . He worked as a lookout during burglaries . Upon seeing danger he would change his music . A bravura piece instead of a nocturnal serenade . A dance of fire . Or something even more spirited . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With older boys . How did Lilac ever spot him ? These lilac fellows have a flair for it . But what does Bow care ? He 's got ideas . While cooling off in the northern swamps he got himself ideas . He 'd better play his fiddle . He still drags it with him to the Reeds every day . Does it for Jaws 's sake . He plays all kinds of variations for Jaws . And blades of reeds rustle and sway in the wind . And seagulls scream . And sandpipers beep , keeping time . Tears stream down Lilac 's venous face . He dribbles sand on Bow 's knees . And he listens . And I must sit through this sorry drivel . Because Scalapendra fancies herself a nudist . Her back is turned to the sun . And I must be there at arm 's reach . " Rogulya ! " Scala calls me . And I must manage to cover her body with a beach towel . Quickly . So that Jaws 's false teeth would n't fall out of his mouth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would go on masturbating with sand . " Rogulya ! " Scalapendra calls me and I jump up-as if stung by an adder-to swathe her bodily charms . Only her feet remain uncovered pointing toward the Ocean . Her belly button gazes at the sun . And her lips are stretched out , ever ready to stick her tongue into the victim and sting it down . All this takes but a moment . Once every half hour or so , our entire gang gets aroused . Everybody has a chance at something . I throw the towel . Jaws eyes the scene . Bow is transported with empathy . Lilac gets an erection . And La Pen just lies on her back . Pensive , she descends into memories . The small pyramids of her breasts . The triangle of her armpits and pubis . Her pursed lips . I 'm tired of my daily chores . Jaws ponders life and reconstructs its events . Bow launches himself into ratiocinations . He 's got ideas . Bow discusses Martian canals with Jaws . <p> " My child , " Lilac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is only one kind of canals that excites imagination . " And he draws phalluses in the sand . Phalluses are Lilac 's hobby . Because of his hobby he 's gotten beat up many times . <p> " Most entertaining , really . " Jaws approves of a new variant of canals Bow plans to dig in the Reeds . <p> " Plentiful fish , that 's the only thing that Martians get their nourishment from , " Bow gets started . <p> " Do you want to repeat here , in Chukhonsk , the Odessa of the mid-1920s ? " Jaws bares his teeth . <p> " I hear they 're talking about changes over at the Castle , " Bow continues . <p> " Bow , you are a damn fool , " I ca n't restrain myself any longer . " They in the Castle want to shove off . What changes are you talking about ? " <p> Scalapendra ca n't stand our scholarly debates . They infuriate her , turning her guts inside out . She also fears for me . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time ) , is to lose everything . " Jaws recapitulates , leading me out of the turf . The turf is our daily gathering point in the Reeds . " You had no business mixing whiskey with champagne . Go on . Erupt ! " <p> I can understand this myself . I even understood it back when I was still a member of the Castle . Her cursed passion for the Architect . Who the hell was he anyhow ? A mere executor of my fantellic ideas . Yes , fantellic , when inspiration generates mc2 . No atoms . No jet fuel . No solar energy . What if my wondrous talent is akin to stellar music , what then ? The Masters ? What about them ? Oh , but it was their wish . They chose to agree with me . Did they wish to sail off ? Probably . I do know for sure that neither the Masters nor the Architect possessed the gift of fantellism . Did Scalapendra have any ? Look at her . There she is , lying on her back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ominous one . Capable of liminality . <p> Who is to blame ? The Architect ? But he 's dead . Scalapendra was the prime suspect . She was detained and interrogated . In the end , we were exiled from the Castle . I was stripped of my privileges . That despite my years of service . And an immaculate reputation . She was my wife , and I vouched for her . But who actually knows what took place between Pen and the Architect ? She 's a strange girl , my La Scala . I understood one main thing : her powers were only confined to the boundaries of the Reeds . Much as I was only capable of fantellism within the boundaries of the Great Expanse . Beyond those boundaries we were just like ordinary sunbathers . And no changes from one state into another . It 's as if all the fantellism gets washed off or something . Scalapendra's-outside Reeds . And mine-outside the Great Expanse . She knows it . I experienced it once in Honolulu . I gorged , I drank , I ogled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my third eye lies buried . <p> " Lovies , you 're vibrating for all the wrong reasons , " Lilac tries to sneak into our learned debate . " There 's a rumor in my bel etage that the Reeds will soon be done with ! " <p> " Rogulya ! " Pen calls me again . I 'm here , ever ready to please her . Everybody gets aroused from Lilac 's words . But mainly from Scalapendra 's shriek . And her delicious shoulder blades on the slender stem of her backbone . Like magnolia leaves . Or blades of a small turbine in a stream . And the chiaroscuro running across her buttocks . <p> " This ca n't be . We ca n't live without the Reeds . Shut the fuck up , Lilac ! " <p> " I 'm only picking up the balls , dear Scala . " Lilac turned amicably purple . <p> " Oh , my God ! My canals ! " Bow gasped . <p> " Information must be reliable , otherwise it becomes misinformation . " Jaws snapped his plastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At night , in my garret , Pen snuggled up to me . <p> " Let 's have it like we used to . All the way . Hold me tight . Do n't be afraid . " <p> No , I was n't afraid . I knew that La 's fantellism , her capacity to sting was limited to the space of the Reeds . Our garret in an old Chukhonian house . A medieval town . An over , grown apple orchard . I was holding an apple in one hand . Before Pen 's lips . With the other I was caressing her breasts . And touching them with my lips . And tasting them with my teeth . <p> " You my apple . Ripe juices . Me eat you . You afraid ? " <p> " Not of you , my gadabout . Rogulya , Gulya , my Gulliver . Darling . You 're my only one . " <p> " But . . . " I wanted to ask about something else . " But what about the Reeds ? " <p> She understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she also understood the inherent truth of my question . <p> " You and the Reeds . " <p> " And whom do you love more ? " <p> She pushed her knees into my stomach and pulled me inside her . <p> " You the Reeds you the Reeds , " she babbled while she was still able to speak , until she began to laugh and cry both together . <p> By morning I knew everything . Actually , to be exact , I had known of her affair with the Architect all along . One need n't be a fantellist to sense alienation or passion in a woman 's eyes . I knew it for a whole year while the Castle was in the final stages of construction . They were working on those parts of the design that could instantly change the Castle into a ship , capable of handling even dry terrain . The Masters were pressing to finish the construction . My fantellistic talents were at a point of breaking . This was also one of the reasons why I grew indifferent toward La . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capable of anything during such periods , except working myself up towards a metamorphosis . Fantellism and earthly love are incompatible . But she , too , must have known that this thing with the Architect would not last very long . That it would soon pass . But the Architect had his own plans . He was taking aim . I , simple soul that I am , revealed to him the design of converting a Castle into a ship . She knew that she could not be without the Reeds . Or I without the Great Expanse . Whereas the Masters could . They had bank deposits in Switzerland . Anyway , they did n't feel at home in their own Great Expanse . As for the sunbathers , I could n't really tell . I knew it would be over for Scala and me if the Reeds were to be destroyed . We would n't expire completely , but merely vegetate . Like when I was in Honolulu . Terrible memories .... <p> The Architect insisted . He would hover over her knees and belly , then collapse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of design from Gulliver . Then we 'll get the hell out of here . All in different directions . You and I. Rogulya to Honolulu . The Masters to Switzerland . " <p> Thank God , I was fantellizing and did n't give in . Like glass to acid . But I was about to come out of it . And Scalapendra knew it . I was drawn to her again . And she struck her blow . The Architect was buried in the old town cemetery . He won posthumous laurels . A street was named in his honor . The Masters raised a howl . They were first outraged , then confused and scared . Scalapendra was expelled from the Castle . I followed her into exile . . . . And now I hear about the threat that hangs over the Reeds , over our little gang . We 're the last little island of dissent . Scalapendra herself is in danger . What will she do without the Reeds ? I realize that our recent intimacy stemmed from this fear . So what ? Love . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . Apples and her breasts . And the moon . And that devilish power of fantellism in me , a power I have n't been able to experience since I followed La Pen into exile . I could feel it rising in me . I was fantellizing . Saved . Saved . Saved . <p> Our gang was gathered at the usual spot , our turf , between a drainage ditch and a small cove , where leeches and infusoria multiply . Everyone looked grave . <p> " Lilac 's right . The town is humming with rumors about the destruction of the Reeds , " said Bow . For the first time in a succession of many summers , he did n't open his violin case . <p> " A little coffin with a baby inside , the baby is sleeping , " Lilac tried to cuddle up to him . <p> " Friends , we have been betrayed . We are in deep shit , " Jaws gnashed briefly , but truthfully . <p> A lilac cloud was spitting onto our turf . Scalapendra was stretched out motionless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had n't said this : " Why are you so silent , Gulliver ? " If she had only remained silent . But those midnight apples , the apples we had tasted together , what were they for ? The first time in many years . Nothing happens without a reason . At least in their opinion . going , sweetums ? They are n't trading Cuckolds yet , " Lilac yelled behind my back . The others remained silent . La Pen just lay there , motionless . <p> I returned to the Castle . The Masters were expecting me . Why else would a renewed pass be waiting for me ? They lacked the gift of fantellism . They knew what they were doing , what and at what price . The Architect had left one little detail unfinished . Thank God ! If he had n't , that would have meant the end of the Reeds . The Castle-turned-Ship would have destroyed the Reeds , moving towards the Baltic Sea . Scalapendra knew it . And she stung the Architect . But now nothing stands in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Ship flies over the Reeds . With the Masters . And I ? Honolulu again ? So be it . What matters is that the Reeds would be spared . They would continue to rustle and listen to Bow 's violin . And Lilac sifting sand . And Jaws waiting for Pen to change her position . The sunbathers wo n't even notice a thing . Like a young bird , the Ship would leap out of the Castle . The sunbathers would be happy with an eggshell . That would maintain order . That and the legend about a fat lady with a pony tail , who had once been stung by my beloved . <p> Trans. from the Russian <p> by Maxim D. Shrayer and Victor Terras <p>
