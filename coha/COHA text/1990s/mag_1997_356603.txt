To a certain kind of discerning television viewer it remains a pop-culture mystery why millions more Americans this season tuned to CBS 's lead-armed Walker , Texas Ranger on Saturday nights than to ABC 's nuanced romantic drama Relativity . To many TV producers this is not a vexing question , however . Nothing is more dramatic than the conflict between life and death , they will tell you ( even if the conflict involves Chuck Norris ) . Slice-of-life series almost never win the ratings that crime shows pull in , which is why eight of the nine new network dramas premiering this spring feature people yelling out lines like " Get me on the phone with forensics ! " <P> The latest  --  and most impressively pedigreed  --  of these new series is ABC 's Gun , which starts on April 12 and runs in Relativity 's old time slot ( Saturdays , 10 p.m . EDT ) . Conceived by director Robert Altman , Gun aims to follow the life of a single pistol  --  an intriguing premise until you realize that no single episode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then arbitrariness is the show 's only distinguishing element . In the first episode , dwarfs appear as waiters at a swank hotel for no explicable reason . In some ways , Gun resembles a camp version of Altman 's Short Cuts . Like that film , it offers vignettes of the striving and the desperate . With Gun , though , viewers are left with characters like Lilly ( Rosanna Arquette ) , a lonely housewife prone to doing suggestive aerobics alone in her living room and whining as though she 's ingested too much Slim-Fast . Chuck Norris would at least know enough to ease the pain with a chili dog . <P>  --  By Ginia Bellafante
