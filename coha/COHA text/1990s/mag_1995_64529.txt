Now that Don Delliquanti has returned to SPORTS ILLUSTRATED after a disaster-laden 14-year hiatus , it 's hard to decide who 's luckier  --  Delliquanti for having survived his trials or the magazine for getting him back . Between his departure from SI in 1981 and his return to our New York City offices as an assistant picture editor last June , Delliquanti lived through two major earthquakes and a plane crash . " All these bad things kept happening while I was away , " he says . " That was all the more reason to come back to SI . " // Delliquanti first came to SI in 1970 as a reporter , eventually moving to the photo department , where by 1978 he had risen to the position of assistant picture editor . While working on a cover story that year about horse-race fixing , he met his future wife , Mary , a Time Inc. lawyer who vetted the article before publication . They married in 1980. // Don left the following year and was working as a photo editor for The New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had boarded while on vacation in Malaga , Spain , encountered trouble . The takeoff was aborted , and the plane skidded off the runway , bursting into flames . Fifty-six people died in the accident . The Delliquantis barely escaped . Mary broke a bone in her foot jumping from the plane 's wing , and Don got a few scratches . " The cabin was filling with smoke , " Don says . " Another 60 seconds and we would have been gone . " They sailed home , and neither has been on a plane since . // Not long afterward Don became manager of photo operations for the Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee , and the Delliquantis settled in California , where their son , Devin , was born in March 1984 . Around the time Devin turned two , Mary 's job as a criminal defense lawyer started to require her to spend more time in court , so Don stayed home with their son for the next nine years , taking law courses at night and occasionally freelancing for SI .

" No more earthquakes , " he says . // The Delliquantis have been rattled by two monumental quakes . Don was in the upper deck at Candlestick Park when San Francisco was jolted during the 1989 World Series , but he escaped without injury . And the January 1994 Northridge quake rocked the family 's Studio City home . The only lasting damage came from a bottle of Worcestershire sauce that shattered on the kitchen floor . " It took three months to get rid of the odor , " Don says . " I still think of earthquakes whenever I smell Worcestershire sauce . " // At SI , Don is back in familiar territory . Having freelanced for the magazine at the 1987 , ' 88 and ' 93 Super Bowls , he 's editing pro football photos for our NFL Plus sections and has already made a reservation on Amtrak for next January 's Super Bowl in Tempe , Ariz .
