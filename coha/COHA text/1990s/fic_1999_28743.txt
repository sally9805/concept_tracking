I parked the ambulance in front of Hell 's Kitchen walk-up number 414 and Larry and I pulled the equipment from the back . It was midnight in April , and the full moon lit the street like a saint 's festival , and as I walked toward the blue-covered brownstone , the faces watching from its windows , I thought again of how much I 'd needed this night to be quiet , of how I 'd walked the seven blocks to work with my shaking hands actually clasped together in the act of praying for a quiet night , and of how , for all that , I 'd been dispatched immediately , and without coffee , to this cardiac arrest . The stoop stairs were littered with revelers drinking and shouting to a radio on the first floor , and when we reached the front gate the singers stopped shouting and then the music was only static . They cleared a lane up the steps , kicking empty cans out of our way , crowding at our sides for the bad news . What apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one wanted to win . Oh Jesus it 's Mr. Burke , the oldest woman said , and the group gathered behind us to collect the stories of the man from 5A , of his drunken son , his spiteful daughter , his wife the saint , and his bad heart . The front door opened , a young boy holding it . He was crying , and when we got inside the screams met us on the ground floor and I knew them well , like the patched rotting steps , the gray-yellow paint , and the red steel doors with three locks in every building I 've climbed through to get to those screams at the top -- they 're always at the top . I knew Mr. Burke was dead and what an awful thing to know , and to have learned through time , and to have to climb . Four flights . We were ushered into a small front room crowded with red velvet chairs and porcelain . Mrs. Burke stood in the center , surrounded by neighbors , and when we entered , their cries became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run dry , and she squeezed them tight . Over here , said a man standing in the hallway like a robbed and beaten sentry . He led us past the kitchen and a small bedroom , into a large back room with a king-size bed upon which lay the figure of Mr. Burke . A woman was kneeling over the old man . She looked up briefly as we came in and then turned and pressed her lips against the already colder , flaccid mouth of her father . " We were just watching television , " said the man who led us in , " and Dad yelled out and started punching his chest and before we could do nothing he locked himself in the bathroom . I said we ought a call you guys but he swore us not to . He was crying and I never once heard the old man cry and after a while we could n't hear anything , so I broke the door in and he was barely breathing . I put him on the bed there and he just stopped . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How long ago did he stop breathing ? " " Maybe ten minutes . The woman on the phone was telling us how to do CPR . Please , you got ta do something . This is gon na kill my mother . " " We 'll do all we can , " I said , wanting to sound confident , but ten minutes was too long , and CPR on a bed is useless . Even as I pulled out the Ambu-bag I wanted to put it back , to sit with the family and pour a few drinks , toast the life they remembered , for there was nothing to celebrate in the body whose heart I was supposed to start . Patrick Burke 's time had come . He probably knew that when he locked the bathroom door . I opened his mouth and felt a box of cool air pass through my fingers , like the morning breath of heavy snow , the last of his life leaving . I 'm sure it was just gas built up in the stomach from CPR , but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things as spirits leaving the body and not wanting to be put back , spirits angry at the awkward places death had left them , and though I understood how crazy I was to think this way , I was also convinced that if I looked up at that moment I would see the old man standing at the window , staring out over the tar-paper plots and gray ditches of his birthplace . I did n't have to look ; I could feel him there , pressed against the glass , waiting for us to finish . " Frank , what are you doing ? " Larry was hooking up the wires to the electrode patches he 'd just placed on Burke 's chest . He plugged them into the EKG monitor and turned it on . I opened my eyes . " Come on , Frank , let 's move along here . " I put the mask over Burke 's face and squeezed the bag , though my heart was n't in it , had n't been in a long time , and neither was Mr. Burke 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green line . The spirit was gone . Standing by the window . If we did manage to jump-start his heart , there 'd be only blood to fill it . But my hands took over ; they always do : trained on hundreds of cardiac arrests , they 're automatic . I pulled out the long steel laryngoscope blade and inserted it into his mouth . Using it like a lever , I lifted the tongue up until I found the white vocal cords , like Roman columns , and I grabbed the thick plastic tube and carefully passed it through those gates , through the dark cartilage of the trachea , into the branched entrance of the lungs . I secured it , hooked the bag up to the tube , and pumped it hard . I called for a backup . Dispatch said first available , which meant we would be on our own for at least twenty minutes . I did n't want to involve the man 's daughter any further , but I needed her hands . She knelt by her father 's head and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She tried very hard but was lost looking into his eyes , her head falling back . " Squeeze , " I had to keep saying . Larry was crunching down violently on the man 's chest and as I fit into the slim space between the bed and the man 's right arm I heard one of the ribs crack , like deep ice in a winter lake . I turned the arm over , found a trace of blue vein , and plunged the needle in . I hooked up the IV and watched the bubbles ride the salt water into his arm . Epinephrine first , one milligram pure adrenaline , a liquid scream in the vein to make the heart feel it 's trapped in a burning shirt factory . Followed by one half milligram of atropine , a more subtle agent that rings an alarm and tells the heart it 's not dead , only sleeping . This heart was n't fooled . I waited a minute and gave him another epi , but the flat line only shivered a moment before flattening again . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get it over with . I shot in an amp of calcium ; gives the heart a Joe Louis punch . I drew up a vial of Isuprel and stuck it into the IV bag and let it run . Isuprel scorches everything in its path . It sets the heart on fire , and the heart can either come back to life to beat the flames out or lie there and burn like dead pine . I added in another epi and atropine and sat back to see what would happen . The flat line on the monitor ran untouched , seemingly infinite and perfect like the axis of the universe , then suddenly it flexed , then bowed , a minute later exploding into one thousand shaking points . I could see the vibration in the chest under Larry 's hands as every muscle in Burke 's heart fired wildly in different directions . I charged up the paddles and placed them on his chest , twelve inches apart . " Clear , " I yelled . " Clear . " The daughter let go and then screamed when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The green line continued to dance , so I shocked him again . The man 's face reared up to mine like a challenge . His daughter groaned and rubbed the head that had thumped heavily upon her knee . The shock of defibrillation is like a slap in the face to the hysterical heart . Sometimes the slap alone gets the heart to pull itself together and start beating normally , but often the soft voice and soothing hand of lidocaine is needed . Just relax , the lidocaine says ; everything will be all right . I gave him eighty milligrams and prepared to shock again , but the daughter would not let go . " No more , " she said , and she was crying . " Please do n't . " Larry pulled her arms away from her father 's face , and I hit him at full power . This time the body hardly moved . There was nothing left . The line on the monitor stopped dancing . It ran straight and smooth and showed no intention of rising . Larry returned to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard another rib snap . Larry was exhausted . Sweat dripped from his nose onto the man 's blue shoulders , and he wheezed with every compression . Larry had trouble mowing his suburban quarter acre without a substantial nap , and a four-flight climb followed by ten minutes of CPR was more than his well-rested body could bear . There were a number of reasons why Larry should have become a plumber or a lawyer -- anything except a medic -- but chief among them was the way his body moved during CPR . He had a heavy gut , stretched by years of dozing off in his stain-guarded Naugahyde recliner , his head tilted forward just enough for him to swallow his beer without choking . When Larry knelt over the dead , his belly would swing like a bowling ball in a shopping bag . The force of this gyration met the force of gravity somewhere in his lower lumbar and inspired a number of unfortunate reflexes . With each compression , Larry 's heels kicked up , his pelvis shot forward , and his head jerked back , giving all present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than most would consider the limits of professional behavior . " Why do n't you let me take over , " I said to him , " while you call Dr. Hazmat and ask for an eighty-three . " After starting CPR and delivering a regulated set of treatments , medics have to call the on-call physician to receive orders for further treatment , or , as in the case of Mr. Burke , to call a dead man an eighty-three . He had been down over twenty minutes , and by the time Larry woke the doctor and explained the situation it would be thirty . All first-line drugs had been used , with little success . The man was dead . We were tired . It was time to pull out the tubes and catheters , unplug the monitor , put the man back on the bed , cover him , and leave this poor family to their grief . Time to get a cup of coffee and park the ambulance by the river for a few minutes of rest . I knelt in Larry 's place and pressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cracked ribs the heart felt like a flat tire . I apologized to him for both of us and gently built up to a soft , steady rhythm . For the first time I looked around the room , at the dust-covered artifacts of the man 's life : unmatched socks under the bed , one gray suit in the closet , pictures scattered on the walls . I thought of all the hours I 'd spent in rooms like this , kneeling on the floor , crunching the chests of dead strangers while putting stories together from the pieces they left behind . Burke 's wedding picture sat on the nightstand . He wore a black tuxedo and posed happily with his young bride on the church steps . From the top of the tall dresser in the corner Private Burke stared down , trying to look tough and ready to fight the Communists but succeeding only in looking young . On one side of him was a Purple Heart in a brown velvet case and on the other was a smaller photo , three GIs arm in arm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to different cities : NEW YORK , 7,862 MILES ; SEOUL , 40 MILES . On the wall above that was a plaque from the New York Times to Patrick Burke , forty years of service , 1952-1992 . Next to it , a photo of the man in work clothes , hands and feet dark with newsprint , looking small before the blue metal girth of the printer . Across the bed , above Mrs. Burke 's low , wide bureau , was a mirror as big as a bay window . In its glass a dark portrait of Christ stared at me from somewhere behind and above . He was pointing to his chest , to where the red robe opened , the heart wrapped in thorns , crowned by flames . At the foot of the bed , next to the window that opened on a wall of windows , the Burke family was born and raised . In its center were three collections of bald , smiling babies . Around them the two older sons became boys in baseball uniforms , then high school graduates . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was married near the window and had two smiling boys of his own . The other never made it that far , his life trailing off to the left , a photo of him bundled up and laughing in the snow , two dried-out palm leaves crossed behind the frame . Both sons ' lives appeared foreshortened in some way , shunted aside , as if the boys had been rushed toward adulthood to make room for their sister , the blond-haired freckled-faced favorite , whose life filled more of the wall than the window . I watched her climb out of diapers , start walking , and go to school . She prayed for all of us at her First Communion , loved to paint and play the violin . She won swimming medals and cheerleading awards , and she always smiled , a smile that grew brighter as her life grew higher , to the top of the wall , queen of the prom , the most beautiful daughter in the world , her place as sacred as the Christ looming behind me . The girl 's life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or babies , nothing superseded that smile , and when I looked at the woman kneeling next to me I understood why . Her face was sharply lined , almost anorexic , still beautiful but harsh and pale as raw quartz . Her blond hair was dyed black and chopped into short , straight bangs . Black makeup ran down her cheeks , and the loose-fitting black tank dress she wore showed the bleached points of her shoulders . It seemed as if she had n't smiled since that night at the prom , as if she had spent the last ten years fighting her way off that wall , and there , on the floor , as she held her dead father 's head between her knees , it seemed she had succeeded miserably . " Squeeze , " I said . I wanted to give some lasting consolation . There was none . " Maybe you should take a break . Your brother could come in for a few minutes and then my partner will be back . " " No . " She shook her head . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for bringing her into this , but she was right : it was a job best done by the already fallen and , in my case , the still falling . I tried to imagine our sitting like that on the Great Lawn in Central Park , a picnic lunch between us on a bright blue and green spring afternoon . I opened the wine and she smiled and stretched her back on a cool breeze . Two young people . " Do you have any music ? " I said . " What ? " " Music . I think it helps if you play something he liked . " I was already using the past tense . " John , " she yelled , " put on the Sinatra . " John came in . He was crying . " Play the Sinatra , " she whispered . The opening strings of " September of My Years " drifted through the room . Not salsa , I thought , not a good rhythm for CPR , but what music to leave with . Unconsciously I picked up my pace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I believed music could make a dead heart beat again , and I once believed my hands were electric and bringing someone back to life was the greatest thing one could do . I have done CPR in grand ballrooms on Park Avenue and in third-floor dance halls uptown . On Park they stand tall black panels around you to shield the dancers from an unpleasant view , while the band keeps up their spirits with songs like " Put on a Happy Face . " Uptown the music never breaks and the dancers ' legs whirl around you like a carnival ride . I 've worked on the floors of some of the finest East Side restaurants , serenaded by violins while the man at the table next to me cut into his prime rib , and I have worked under the gory fluorescence of basement diners where taxi drivers can order , eat , and be back on the road in ten minutes . I 've watched Broadway shows from the front row , kung fu pornography from Times Square balconies . I once brought a bartender back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dance music played . The patrons moved over for us , but no one stopped drinking . One of my first cardiac arrests was in the Graceland Ballroom . I 'd been there the Friday night before , to pick up a young man shot in the head , but this was Sunday afternoon , when families come from all over the city to talk and dance . A salsa band was playing , and the crowd of dancers made a path for us without losing a beat . The man lay dead in the middle of the floor , dead but not lifeless , because nothing could be lifeless in a room so full of laughter and dancing and music that sounded off your heart . We had a backup unit behind us and my partner and I moved perfectly -- intubated with an epinephrine on board in twenty seconds . I took over CPR , my hands rising and falling into the rhythm of the music and the dancers ' feet stepping nimbly around us to the salsa beat , a pulse of life . On the monitor I watched my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands away the beats continued . " He has a pulse , " I shouted , and stuck my thumb up in the air . The man started breathing on his own , and as we pulled the stretcher out the crowd cheered and slapped us on the back and the dancers filled in behind . Walking from that room I was blessed by life . I had purpose for the first time and it carried me through those early wild years . Only much later did that beat begin to fade , and only recently did it disappear , leaving a cold stone in its place . Larry had been on the phone ten minutes , and my knees felt as if I 'd just spent an hour in a confessional . I had to admit that Burke looked better . The blue was gone from his cheeks , and the broken vessels in his nose had turned a familiar red . He was n't that old really , barely sixty . I noticed beats on the monitor , too wide to carry a pulse , but they were gathering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the brown leaves falling down . When I looked up again the beats had tightened . I stopped and found a weak pulse in his neck , which soon became a strong pulse at the wrist . I sat on the bed . His brain was dead ; I was pretty sure of that . I checked his pupils ; they were fixed in place , but his heart was beating like a young man 's . Larry came in . " It 's okay , Frank . We can call it . Eighty-three " No we ca n't , " I said . " He 's got a pulse . " " No shit . " The daughter looked up . " Is he going to be all right ? " " His heart 's beating . " I did n't say that he would never wake up and that his heart would beat on as long as machines pumped in food and oxygen -- that I was just acting on orders . The news of Mr. Burke 's recovery spread quickly , and soon the living room was full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a longboard and the two EMTs helped us strap the old man in . Larry and I packed up the equipment . The stairway was tight and it took some time to get down ; at each turn we had to tilt the board and pass it hand to hand over the railings , all the time fighting to keep the airway tube in place . The daughter led our procession , glaring at the faces that peered out from every door . When we reached the bottom she waved her arms at the people still sitting on the stoop --  " Get out , get out "  - -  pushing the ones on the top until the crowd moved and split , gathering on each side of the front gate to watch us bear Mr. Burke down the last six steps . At the back doors to the ambulance I felt the rain start . I looked up to where the clouds had moved under the moon , and in the fifth-floor window I saw Mr. Burke standing , watching the proceedings . The light seemed to go through him , his body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real to me than the man strapped to the board , the eyes unblinking in the rain . I held my breath and bent over , waiting for the feeling to pass . When I looked up again , Mrs. Burke had taken his place . She was holding a suit and a pair of shoes ; she reached up her arm and the light went off . " Let 's go , Frank , " Larry said , and together we loaded Burke 's body into the back .
