<p> In golf , the saying goes : Drive for show , putt for dough . <p> The baseball equivalent of that phrase could be the motto for this year 's Philadelphia Phillies : Swing for show , pitch for dough . <p> For years , the Phillies scored runs at a dizzying pace . Then , they would turn around and give them up even faster  --  and finish in the second division . <p> This year the Phillies are scoring . The big difference is that their pitchers no longer are the human punching bags of the National League . Their staff ERA is 3.34 , second-best in the league . <p> " " The reason they are where they are is their pitching , " said Astros second baseman Craig Biggio . " " You can take for granted every year that they 're going to lead the league in runs scored , home runs , batting average . They always could hit . But the way their pitching staff came together this year is the turning point . <p> " " They 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know you 're going to have to score at least five runs to win because of the way they hit . Now it 's a lot tougher to get those five runs . " <p> With a 43-17 record , the Phillies could play .500 ball the rest of the way for manager Jim Fregosi , now in his second full season , and still win 93 games . In order for the second-place St. Louis Cardinals to win 93 games , they would have to go 61-42 . <p> Unless the Phillies collapse , another worst-to-first story is unfolding . Philadelphia finished last in the NL East in 1992 , going 70-92 and losing more games than any team aside from Los Angeles . <p> This year they have been in first place for all but one day ( April 9 ) . <p> " " I 'd sure trade places with them right now , " said Astros manager Art Howe . " " To have that kind of lead this early means all you have to do is avoid the long losing streaks . With the pitching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that happening . <p> " " They 've always been a good offensive club . Now they 've got some starting pitching to go with it . That 's been the difference . " <p> With bulging muscles and scowling , surly looks on their unshaven faces , Phillies hitters have attracted the attention of casual baseball fans who want to believe that offense is everything . <p> And the Phillies lead the league in runs , doubles , homers , slugging percentage and on-base average . <p> But if not for the Phillies ' five-man starting rotation , this season probably would be spiraling down as another good-hit , no-pitch season in Philadelphia . <p> The Phillies have two eight-game winners in Tommy Greene and Curt Schilling , a seven-game winner in Terry Mulholland and a combined 10-5 mark from Danny Jackson and Ben Rivera , their fourth and fifth starters . <p> The rotation 's record is 33-11 with a remarkable 17 complete games , more than double any other staff in the league . <p> What makes this rotation even more interesting is that Phillies general manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , traded for all five starting pitchers . In an age when it is routinely accepted that you ca n't trade for pitching , Thomas has done it five times . <p> Schilling , who came from the Astros for the since-departed Jason Grimsley last spring , calls the rotation " " The Drifters . " He says all five of them drifted to the Phillies at precisely the right time in their careers . <p> Here is how Thomas built a rotation that might be the equal of the Atlanta Braves ' staff that some people wanted to ship straight to Cooperstown : <p> Schilling , from the Astros for Grimsley in April 1992 . This was a deal the Astros made because they did n't see Schilling sticking as a reliever and he was out of minor-league options . What the Astros overlooked was putting Schilling into the rotation . In 39 starts over the last two seasons with the Phillies , he is 21-9 with 15 complete games . <p> Mulholland , with Charlie Hayes and Dennis Cook , from San Francisco for Steve Bedrosian and Rick Parker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win the NL West that season , and Bedrosian was the man they wanted . Hayes and Cook are gone from the Phillies , but Mulholland has turned into an All-Star lefthander . He led the league with 12 complete games last year and has six this season . <p> Greene , with Dale Murphy , from Atlanta for Jeff Parrett , Jim Vatcher and Victor Rosario in May 1991 . Greene was more or less a throw-in with Murphy-for-Parrett the key to the deal . After a shoulder injury last season , Greene is 8-0 with a 2.27 ERA and had a string of five straight complete games snapped Thursday against New York . <p> Jackson from Florida for Matt Whisenant and Joel Adamson in November 1992 . The Marlins selected Jackson from Pittsburgh in the expansion draft and traded him to the Phillies for two pitching prospects . Jackson , who was a bust as a free agent with the Cubs , is showing some of the same form he did in 1988 , when he was the Cy Young runner-up with Cincinnati . With a 6-2 record and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starter . <p> Rivera from Atlanta for Donnie Elliott in July 1992 . This was a little-noted deal , but the 6-7 Rivera might have the best raw stuff of any Phillies pitcher . At 24 , Rivera ( 4-3 , 4.25 ) needs consistency , but he is capable of shutting down a team . <p> Thomas ' moves have not been confined to pitching . Some of his other more notable deals : <p> John Kruk , with Randy Ready , from San Diego for Chris James ; Lenny Dykstra , with Roger McDowell , from New York for Juan Samuel ; David West from Minnesota for Mike Hartley , Mitch Williams from Chicago for Chuck McElroy and Bob Scanlan . <p> Thomas took Dave Hollins in the Rule 5 draft from San Diego , claimed Wes Chamberlain on waivers from Pittsburgh on what became a forced trade with the Pirates , and signed Mariano Duncan , Pete Incaviglia , Milt Thompson , Larry Andersen and Jim Eisenreich as free agents . <p> The result is a team of players from organizations throughout baseball that have banded as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chins , tattoos on their arms and legs and look a little bit like a slow-pitch softball team . <p> But more than anything , the Phillies have fun . Andersen , who adds more to a clubhouse than perhaps any player in baseball , believes atmosphere is one of the main reasons for this year 's success . <p> " " This is a team that likes to have fun , likes to laugh and be loud , and we take that attitude on the field , " Andersen said . <p> " " After games , there 's 10 or 11 of us sitting around , drinking a beer and talking baseball . We 're not telling war stories , we 're talking about what happened that night and who we 've got next . <p> We 're like an old-time team in that regard . " <p> " " We 're enjoying it , " said second baseman Mickey Morandini . <p> " " But I think the big thing is that we 're winning . We had basically the same guys here last year , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and crazy we were then . " <p> There is no lack of leadership on the Phillies . Players from other organizations quickly realize that Kruk and catcher Darren Daulton lead the way on and off the field . <p> " " We did n't have a real leader in Kansas City , " Eisenreich said . " " George Brett was a guy who led by example or play , but he was not a spokesperson , and I think that 's what we were lacking . <p> " " There are a lot of veteran guys here . Daulton especially , but there are others . My first day here , I did n't say anything to anyone . As I was leaving , David Hollins said , " " Nice talking to you . " <p> After several mediocre seasons in which he was the whipping boy of the boo-birds in Philadelphia , Daulton had 109 RBIs last year . He drove in 50 runs in his first 54 games this year and is , without question , the best catcher in the game . <p> But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kruk , Incaviglia and others are just as important to the offense . For the next four to six weeks , the Phillies will be without Hollins , who suffered a broken bone in his right hand Thursday night after a bad-hop ground ball hit his wrist . <p> " " We 've gotten much better support than last year , " said Daulton . " " We 've got a lot of guys who can kill you . It 's usually a different hero each game . The load is n't on just one guy . " Daulton is one of only six Phillies who have spent their entire careers in the organization . ( Morandini , first baseman Ricky Jordan , reliever Tim Mauser and infielders Joe Millette and Kim Batiste are the others . ) Because he has endured the bad times and has been booed , this year 's success means that much more to him . <p> " " I was n't going to let a few loud mouths drive me out of town , " Daulton said , " " and the rest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A lot of frustration has built up . They 've been waiting for a winner for a long time . I 'd like to help give them one . " Now that the Phillies have a pitching staff that can complement the offense , they are on track for their first division title since 1983 . The days of looking good at the plate and losing 10-9 are gone . The days of cashing playoff checks are around the corner . <p> How they were built <p> Key Phillies transactions put together by general manager Lee Thomas : <p> Wes Chamberlain , RF Acquired in August 1990 from the Pirates with Julio Peguero and Tony Longmire for Carmelo Martinez . <p> Mariano Duncan , 2B-SS Signed as a free agent after the 1991 season . <p> Len Dykstra , CF Acquired in June 1989 from the Mets with Roger McDowell and Tom Edens for Juan Samuel . <p> Tommy Greene , SP Acquired in August 1990 from the Braves with Dale Murphy for Jim Vatcher , Jeff Parrett and Victor Rosario . <p> Dave Hollins , 3B Drafted from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Signed as a free agent after the 1992 season . <p> Danny Jackson , SP Acquired in November from the Marlins for Joel Adamson and Matt Whisenant after the Marlins claimed him in the expansion draft . <p> John Kruk , 1B ( above ) Acquired in June 1989 from the Padres with Randy Ready for Chris James . <p> Terry Mulholland , SP Acquired in June 1989 from the Giants with Charlie Hayes and Dennis Cook for Steve Bedrosian . <p> Ben Rivera , SP Acquired in June 1992 from the Braves for Donnie Elliott . <p> Curt Schilling , SP Acquired in April 1992 from the Astros for Jason Grimsley . <p> Mitch Williams , RP Acquired 1991 from the Cubs for Chuck McElroy and Bob Scanlan . <p> The Phillies ' numbers <p> June 13 , 1992 June 13 , 1993 W L Pct GB W.
