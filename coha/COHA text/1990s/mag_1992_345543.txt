Kiichi Miyazawa was playing to the hometown crowd when he told the Japanese parliament last week that American workers are lazy , greedy and lack a work ethic . Insulting as the Prime Minister 's comments were , they were not the worst thing that Japanese politicians have said about Americans in the past few weeks . No wonder Americans are wounded . It is n't just that the Japanese view of U.S. workers is degrading , it 's that it is wrong  --  and woefully out of date . <P> There are two kinds of U.S. workers : the ones the Japanese imagine and the ones Americans see around them , putting in long hours and worrying about the future . Miyazawa 's description of poorly motivated workers , unwilling to put in long hours , sounds like the classic management view of featherbedding autoworkers in the 1960s . While he imagines workers who are doing less and less , the truth is that Americans are working longer and longer hours . Perhaps Miyazawa has the right to strike back at the quality of American effort after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But are the problems of U.S. companies the result of a lack of effort by the average worker ? <P> Not according to Juliet Schor 's impressive new book , The Overworked American ( Basic Books ; $21 ) . A Harvard economist , Schor charts the relentless expansion of American work and the steady erosion of leisure time over the past 20 years . It turns out that the average U.S. employee puts in 163 more hours a year now than in 1970 . And while it is true that Japanese manufacturing workers put in six weeks ' worth of hours more every year than their U.S. counterparts , they do it by working six-day weeks and skipping most of their vacation time . Meanwhile , Americans are laboring eight weeks ' worth of hours more than the Germans . <P> Moonlighting has proliferated as businesses have shifted to greater use of part-time workers . More than 7 million Americans hold two or three jobs to make ends meet . Overall , women are paying the highest price : for every additional hour they have added to their jobs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor at home . Certainly American business must find ways to operate more efficiently . But simply keeping employees in the office longer is not the answer .
