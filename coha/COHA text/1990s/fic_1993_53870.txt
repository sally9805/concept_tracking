TWO THINGS HAPPENED at the school during the weeks before I visited Jefferson in jail . The superintendent of schools made his annual visit , and we got out our first load of wood for winter . <p> We heard on Monday by Farrell Jarreau who had gotten the news from Henri Pichot that the superintendent was going to visit us sometime during the week , but we did n't know what day or time . I told my students to take baths each morning and wear their best clothes to school each day . After pledging allegiance to the flag in the yard , and after reciting their Bible verses inside the church , I would send a student back outside to look out for the superintendent . If the student saw a car , any car , turn off the highway down into the quarter , he or she was supposed to run back inside and tell me . The superintendent did n't show up until Thursday . By then we had had many false alarms . The minister of the church , who did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visits to church members . A doctor had come once , a midwife had visited a young woman twice , an insurance man had come once , a bill collector from a furniture store had made a visit , Henri Pichot had driven through the quarter at least once each day , and family and friends of people in the quarter had also visited . On Thursday , just before two o'clock , the boy I had watching for cars ran into the church . <p> " Another one , Mr. Wiggins , another one . " <p> " All right , " I said to the class . " Keep those books opened and look sharp . " <p> I passed my fingers over my shirt collar and checked the knot in my necktie . I felt for the flaps of my coat pockets to be sure both were outside the pockets . I had three suits  --  blue , gray , and brown . I had on the navy blue today . In the yard I passed the tips of my shoes over the back of my pant legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The superintendent stopped his car before the door of the church . A thick cloud of gray dust flew over the top of the car farther down into the quarter . The superintendent was a short fat man with a large red face and a double chin , and he needed all of his enegry to get out of the car . <p> " Dr. Paul , " I said . <p> " Hummmm , stifling , " he said . <p> I thought it was a little cool , myself , but I figured that anyone as heavy as he was must have felt stifled all the time . He wheezed his way across the shallow ditch that separated the road from the churchyard . He looked up at me , but I could tell he did n't remember my name , though he had visited the school once each year ever since I had been teaching there . <p> " Grant Wiggins , " I said . <p> " How are you , Higgins ? " <p> " Wiggins , sir , " I said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , " he said . " All this running around . More schools to attend . " <p> Dr. Paul visited the colored schools once a year , the white schools probably twice  --  once each semester . There were probably a dozen schools in the parish to visit , if that many . <p> " We 're honored that you took out this time for us , sir . " <p> He grunted and looked around the yard . There was a good breeze coming in from the direction of the cane fields , and it wavered the flag on the pole in the yard . <p> " Place looks about the same , " Dr. Paul said . <p> " Things change very slowly around here , Dr. Paul , " I said . <p> " Hummmm , " he said . <p> I motioned for him to precede me into the church . He needed all his strength to go up the three wooden steps , and as he entered the door , I heard Irene Cole , the sixth-grade student in charge , call out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I followed Dr. Paul down the aisle , and on either side of us the students from primer through the sixth grade stood as still and as straight as soldiers for inspection . <p> I nodded toward my desk for Dr. Paul to take my chair . He grunted , which meant thanks , and pulled the chair farther from the desk before he sat down . He needed the extra distance for comfort . <p> Irene was watching me all the time , and when I nodded to her , she called out to the classes , " Seats . " And the whole school sat as one . We had been rehearsing this , morning and afternoon , for the past three days . <p> " Students , I 'm sure you all know Dr. Paul Morgan , " I told them . " Dr. Paul is our superintendent of schools here in St. Rahapel Parish . <p> He has taken time out of a very busy schedule to visit us for a few minutes . Please respond loudly , ' Thank you , Dr. Paul . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their greeting by , " Hummmm . " <p> " Dr. Paul , we 're at your service , " I said , and sat down on one of the benches against the wall . <p> Dr. Paul sat back in the chair , and still his large stomach nearly touched the edge of the table . He looked over the classes from one side of the aisle to the other as though he was trying to catch someone doing something improper . <p> " Primer , on your feet , " he said . <p> They stood up , about seven or eight of them . Dr. Paul looked them over a moment , then told the little girl at the end to come forward . The girl took a deep breath and looked at the girl standing beside her before coming up to the desk . She was afraid , but she came up quickly and stood before the table with her little arms tight to her side . She would not look up . <p> " Nothing to be afraid of , child , " Dr. Paul said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Gloria Hebert , " she said , with her head down . <p> " I ca n't hear you if you keep your head down , " Dr. Paul told her . <p> She looked up , timidly . " Gloria Hebert . " <p> " That 's a pretty name , " Dr. Paul said . " Hold out your hands . " <p> She must have thought she had said something wrong or done something wrong , because as she held her hands out across the table , palms up , I could see them trembling . <p> " Turn them over , " Dr. Paul told her . She did . <p> " Uh-huh , " he said . " Relax . " <p> She did not know what he wanted her to do . <p> " Lower your arms , child , " Dr. Paul said . She brought her arms back to her side and lowered her eyes as well . <p> " Did you say your Bible verse this morning , Gloria ? " <p> " Yes sir , Dr. Paul . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he asked her . <p> " I said , ' Lord is my Shepherd , I shall not want , ' Dr. Paul . " <p> " Hummmm , " Dr. Paul said . " Seems I 've heard that one before . But you 're a bright little girl . You tell your folks Dr. Paul said they ought to be proud of you . Go back to your seat . " <p> " Thank you , Dr. Paul , " she said , bowing and turning away quickly . She smiled as she faced forward again . But no one else was smiling . <p> " Primers , take your seats , " Dr. Paul said . " First graders , on your feet . " <p> And he called on the one boy in class I wished had stayed home today . He was without doubt the worst child in the school . He came from a large family  --  thirteen , fourteen , fifteen , I do n't know how many  --  and he had to fight for every crumb of food he got . At school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marbles , he fought if he played ball , he fought if he played hide-go-seek , he fought if he played hide-the-switch . In class he fought with those who sat in front of him , beside him , or behind him . I had punished him as much during the last month as I had done all the other children together . <p> Dr. Paul asked his name , and he ran three words together even I could n't understand . His name was Louis Washington , Junior , but what he had said did n't sound anything like that . <p> " Your hands , " Dr. Paul told him . <p> The hands had been cleaned an hour before , I 'm sure , because I had checked each pair when the students came in from dinner . But now the palms of those same hands were as black and grimy as if he had been pitching coal all day . <p> " Did you pledge allegiance to the flag this morning ? " Dr. Paul asked him . <p> " Yazir , " he said . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a hundred times to say . " Yazir . " <p> " Well ? " Dr. Paul said . <p> " Want me go stand outside and s'lute flag ? " the boy asked . <p> " You do n't have to go outside , " Dr. Paul said . " You can show me in here . " <p> The boy raised his hand to his chest . <p> " Plege legen toda flag . Ninety state . ' Merica . Er , er  --  yeah , which it stand . Visibly . Amen . " <p> Dr. Paul grunted . Several students giggled . Dr. Paul seemed quite satisfied . That meant that I had to do a lot more work . <p> For the next half hour it went on like that . Dr. Paul would call on someone who looked half-bright , then he would call on someone he felt was just the opposite . In the upper grades  --  fourth , fifth , and sixth  --  he asked grammatical , mathematical , and geographical questions . And besides looking at hands , now he began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  --  and Dr. Paul would have the poor boy or girl spreading out his or her lips as far as he or she could while he peered into the student 's mouth . At the university I had read about slave masters who had done the same when buying new slaves , and I had read how cattlemen did the same when buying horses and cattle . But at least Dr. Paul had graduated to the level where he let the boy or girl spread out his or her own lips , rather than he using some kind of crude metal instrument to do so . I appreciated his humanitarianism . <p> Finally , when he felt that he had inspected enough mouths and hands , he gave the school a ten-minute lecture on nutrition . Beans were good , he said . Not only just good , but very very good . Beans , beans , beans , he must have said beans at least a hundred times . Then he said fish and greens were good . And exercise was good . In other words , good hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gathering potatoes , pulling onions , working in the garden , all of that was good exercise for a growing boy or girl . <p> " Higgins , I must compliment you , you have an excellent crop of students , an excellent crop , Higgins . You ought to be proud . " <p> He had said the same thing the year before , and he had called me Higgins then , too . And the year before that he had said the same thing , but he had called me Washington that time . So at least he was getting closer to my real name . <p> " Rise , " Irene called to the class . <p> They came to their feet , their heads up , their arms clasped to their sides . But instead of feeling pride , I felt hatred of myself for drilling them as I had done . <p> Dr. Paul and I went down the aisle . When he came outside he looked up at the flag waving on its bamboo pole . I thought for a moment the superintendent was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too tired or too lazy to raise his hand . <p> " Doing a good job , Higgins , " he said . <p> " I do the best I can with what I have to work with , Dr. Paul , " I said . <p> " I do n't have all the books I need . In some classes I have two children studying out of one book . And even with that , some of the pages in the book are missing . I need more paper to write on , I need more crayons for the blackboards , I need more pencils , I even need a better heater . " <p> " We 're all in the same shape , Higgins , " he said . <p> I did n't answer him . <p> " I said we 're all in the same shape , Higgins , the white schools just as the colored schools . We take what the state gives us , and we make the best of it . " <p> " Many of the books I have to use are hand-me-downs from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And they have missing pages . How can I  --  " <p> " Are you questioning my trust , Higgins ? " <p> " No sir , Dr. Paul . I was just  --  " <p> " Thank you , Higgins , " he said . <p> He started to get back into the car . It was harder getting back into the car than it was getting out , because he was upset with me now . <p> " More drill on the flag , Higgins , " he said , through the rolled-down window . " More emphasis on hygiene . " <p> " Some of these children had never seen a toothbrush before coming to school , Dr. Paul . " <p> " Well , is n't that your job , Higgins ? " <p> " Yes sir , I suppose so . But then I would have to buy them . " <p> " Ca n't they work ? " he asked me . " Look at all the pecan trees . " He waved his hand toward the trees in the yards . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quarter . Back in the field , back in the pasture you can count another hundred , two hundred trees . Get them off their lazy butts , they can make enough for a dozen toothbrushes in one evening . " <p> " That money usually goes to helping the family , Dr. Paul . " <p> " Then you tell the family about health , " he said , looking out of the rolled-down window to let me know that his visit was over . " I have another school to visit . All this running around is ' nough to give a man a heart attack . " <p> He drove away . I stood there until he had turned his car around and started back up the quarter . I waved at him , but he did not wave back . <p> And that was our visit of the year by the superintendent of schools . <p> One week after the superintendent of schools paid us his annual visit , we got our first load of wood for winter . Two old men brought the wagonload of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a gate wide enough for the wagon to come through , so the old men came into the yard next door to the church . One got down off the wagon to open the gate while the other drove the wagon into the yard . I could not see them , but I could hear them . They were joking about the mules , the wood , and the weather . One of them said : " Do n't let Bird hang us up in that ditch now . I do n't feel like unloading all this wood way out here , and got to put it on that wagon again . " <p> " She go'n pull , " the other one said . " Hi , there , Bird , get them shoulders in there . " <p> I heard the wagon cross the ditch and come into the yard . <p> " All right , " I said to the class . " The first one who looks outside will spend an hour in the corner . They can do pretty well without you . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windows , on the other side of the fence . I could see the two mules , one big and red , the other small and dark brown with long droopy ears , pulling hard into the chains . Then I saw the long poles of wood stacked high upon the wagon , with one of the old men riding atop the wood while the other one , the one who had opened the gate , walked alongside the wagon . They were still joking and laughing . <p> " Louis Washington , Junior , get back into that corner and face the wall . " <p> " But , Mr. Wiggins , now you was looking out that window , too , now . I seen you . " <p> " Just out the corner of my eye , " I said . <p> " Now , I was just looking out the corner of my eye , too , Mr. Wiggins , now . " <p> " In that case I wo n't punish you for looking out of the window , " I said . " But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You were supposed to say , ' You were looking out of the window , Mr. Wiggins ' ; not ' You was looking out of the window , Mr. Wiggins . ' Get back in that corner and face the wall and stay there . One more word out of you and you 'll spend the rest of the day standing on one leg . " <p> Sitting at my desk , I could hear the old men unloading the wood . They had driven all the way into the back , and now they were throwing the long poles of wood across the fence into the churchyard . They were still kidding each other . <p> " Show me them grits , show me them grits you had this morning , now . " <p> " I got my end up , " the other one said . <p> " Well , I got the heavy end , " the first one said . <p> " You sure got that right , " the second one said . They both laughed . And I heard the wood come across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour , then one of the old men knocked on the back door . I went to the door to see what he wanted . <p> " Professor , " he said , and smiled . <p> His name was Henry Lewis , a short black man with hardly any teeth . His hands were the color and texture of the legs of a snapping turtle . He wore an old straw hat , a green-and-brown plaid shirt , khaki pants , and rubber boots . He had grandchildren in the school . <p> " Some wood there , " he said . " I 'm leaving the saw and couple them axe . Your boys can chop it up . " <p> " Appreciate it , Mr. Lewis , " I said . <p> " Glad to be of service . " <p> I spoke to Amos Thomas , a thin brown-skinned man , who sat on the wagon . He nodded back to me . <p> " That ought to hold you a while , " Mr. Lewis said to me . " Just call ' fore it run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Thanks , " I said . <p> " Bye , Professor . " <p> " Good-bye , Mr. Lewis . Mr. Thomas . " <p> I went back to my desk . <p> " All right , " I said to the class . " It 's a quarter to twelve now . I 'm letting you out early because you 'll have to chop wood this afternoon . I want you all back up here by twelve-thirty . " <p> That afternoon I stood by the fence while the fifth- and sixth-grade boys sawed and chopped the wood . The smaller boys and all the girls were still inside . They wanted to know why they had to study while the older boys were outside having fun . I told them that they could have fun the next day picking up chips and stacking wood while the older boys were inside studying . They did not see this as quite the same , but when I did n't give them any other choice they grudgingly relented . I gave them assignments and left Irene Cole in charge . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw and chop the wood . Two would saw while another sat on the pole of wood to keep it steady . The other two boys split logs and chopped up small branches with the axes . They laughed and kidded each other while they worked . They were having much more fun out here than they would have had inside studying their books . <p> And I thought to myself , What am I doing ? Am I doing any good at all ? Am I reaching them at all ? They are acting exactly as the old men did earlier . They are fifty years younger , maybe more , but still doing the same thing that those old men did who never attended school a day in their lives . Is it all just one vicious circle ? Am I doing anything ? <p> And I thought about the other one , the one who had to sit in a chair , strapped down , while electricity shot through his body until he was dead . He had chopped wood in this same yard , probably with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick-lipped boy ; never asking for the axe , but once he had taken it he would not give it back until the last piece of wood had been cut . <p> " Jefferson ? Jefferson ? Let somebody else work , Jefferson . " <p> " I ai n't tired , Mr. Wiggins . I 'm far from getting tired . " <p> I used to stand back and look at him and wonder how I could get him to study his books with half the determination with which he swung that axe . But nothing , nothing that I could think of . To tell him to stand in the corner would have been a joke on me , not him . If he had refused , what could I have done ? I sure could not whip him . There was nothing else but to talk , and no amount of talking could penetrate that skull . But now  --  now within the next few weeks , maybe a couple months , they wanted me to do something that none of us could do over the years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The two who had been sawing were now splitting the logs , and the two who had been using the axes were now sawing . The same boy still straddled the log to keep it steady . They were having fun  --  as I had had fun doing the same thing when I was that age . <p> And there were others . They had chopped wood here , too , then they were gone . Gone to the fields , to the small towns , to the cities , where they died . There was always news about one who had been stabbed to death or shot to death who was still in his teens or his twenties . <p> But the big mulatto from Poulaya had predicted it , had n't he ? It was he as teacher then who stood by the fence while we chopped wood . He had told us that most of us would die violently , and those who did not would be brought down to the level of the beast . That there was no other choice but to run and run . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have run . That in him  --  no , he did not say all of this , but we felt it  --  there was nothing but hatred for himself as well as contempt for us . That he hated himself for the mixture of his blood and the cowardice of his being , and that he hated us for daily reminding him of it . No , he did not tell us this , but daily he showed us this . As clearly as anything he showed his hatred for himself and for us . He could teach us only one thing , and that one thing was flight . Because there was no freedom here . He said it , and he did n't say it . But we felt it . When we told our people how we felt , they told us to go back and learn all we could . There were those who did go back to learn , others who only went back . And having no place to run , they went into the fields ; others went into the small towns and cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that , no , I would not be one of the others , that I would learn as much as he could teach me , then I would go away to learn from someone else . But that I would learn as much as he could teach me . And when he saw that I wanted to learn he hated me even more than he did the others , because I challenged him when the others did not . The others believed what he said . They went out into the fields , others went into the small towns and into the cities and died . So you think you can ? he said . So you think you can ? No , he did not say it with words , only with his eyes . You will be the loser , my friend . Maybe he did not say friend , either ; he probably did n't say friend ; fool , more likely . Anyway , you will be the loser . Yes , I will teach you . You want to learn , I will help you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , knowing that someone else has taken the burden . Good , good , you want to learn ? Good , good , here is the burden . <p> Even after I had gone away for further education , on returning to the plantation to visit my aunt I could still see the hatred in him . And after he had retired from teaching because of ill health , when I would visit him at his home in Poulaya , I would still feel his hatred for himself , for me , for the world . Once , sitting at the fireplace with me , he said , " Nothing pleases me more than when I hear of something wrong . Hitler had his reason , and even the Ku Klux Klans of the South have reasons for what they do . You do n't believe me , do you ? " he asked me . <p> " No sir , I do n't , " I said . <p> " You will one day , " he said . " I told you what you should have done , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will one day . When you see that those five-and-a-half months you spend in that church each year is just a waste of your time , you will . You will . You 'll hate . You 'll see that it 'll take more than five-and-a-half months to wipe away  --  peel  --  scrape away that blanket of ignorance that 's been plastered and replastered over that brain the past three hundred years . You 'll see . " Then he would become quiet a long time while we both stared into the fire . <p> " I 'm cold , " he said one day while we sat there looking into the fire . I got up to put another piece of wood into the fireplace . " That 's no good , " he said . " I 'll still be cold . I 'll always be cold . " He looked at me . " You 'll see , you 'll see . " <p> " I must , " I said . <p> " No , you do n't must , " he said . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " You did , " I said . <p> " Yes , I did , " he said . " But I told you not to . I told you to go . God has looked after them these past three hundred years without your help , Fie wo n't  --  " <p> " God ? " I said . Because I had never heard him say God before . Because when we had said our Bible verses for him he seemed to have hated the very words we spoke . " Sir , did I hear you say  --  ? " <p> " I 'm cold , " he cut me off . " I stay cold . You better go . Come back some other time if you like . I made a mistake . " <p> Now , about that mulatto teacher and me . There was no love there for each other . There was not even respect . We were enemies if anything at all . He hated me , and I knew it , and he knew I knew it . I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell me something that none of the others could or would . I came back a month later . I remember that it was cold that day , too . I brought some wine . He sent me into the kitchen to get two glasses . <p> " This will warm you up , " I said . <p> " Nothing can warm me up , " he said . He sat in the rocker gazing down at the fire with the blanket tight around him . He was a big-boned man , but very skinny now . " To flight , " he said , raising his glass . <p> " But you did n't go , " I said . <p> " I 'm Creole , " he said . " Ca n't you tell ? " <p> " Was that it ? " I asked him . <p> " That was it , " he said . " I 'm Creole . Do you know what a Creole is ? <p> A lying cowardly bastard . Do you know that ? " <p> " No , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I was afraid , " he said , looking into the fire . " I was afraid to run away . What am I ? Look at me . Where else could I have felt superior to so many but here ? " <p> " Is that important ? " I asked him . <p> " It is , " he said . " For everyone . Especially for the whites and the near-whites . It is important . " <p> " Do you feel superior to me ? " I asked him . <p> " Of course , " he said . " Do n't be a damned fool . I am superior to you . I am superior to any man , blacker than me . " <p> " Is that why you hate me ? " I asked him . <p> " Exactly , " he said . " Because that superior son of a bitch out there said I am you . " <p> " Do you think he is superior to you ? " I asked him . <p> " Of course , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , " I said . <p> " Just stay here long enough , " he said . " He 'll make you the nigger you were born to be . " <p> " My only choice is to run then ? " I asked him . <p> " That was your choice . But you wo n't . You want to prove I 'm wrong . <p> Well , you 'll visit my grave one day and tell me how right I was . " <p> " Tell me more , " I said . <p> " What 's wrong with that university ? " he asked . " Do n't they tell you ? " <p> " They tell me how to succeed in the South as a colored man . They tell me about reading , writing , and arithmetic . I need to know about life . " <p> " I ca n't tell you anything about life , " he said . " What do I know about life ? I stayed here . You have to go away to know about life . There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You want to know about life ? Well , it 's too late . Forget it . Just go on and be the nigger you were born to be , but forget about life . You make me tired , and I 'm cold . The wine does n't help . " <p> I visited him again only a month or two before he died in the winter of ' 42 . He was forty-three years old . That was my first year as a teacher . I had been teaching two or three weeks when I visited him . We had just gotten our first load of wood for winter . Maybe that 's why I had gone to see him then . I could always remember that first load of wood for winter , how we older boys had chopped the wood while he stood back against the fence overseeing us . He looked awful frail that day . I had n't seen him in several months . He was being looked after by a relative who did not care too much for anyone visiting him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and left us . He sat at the fireplace . Summer or winter he always sat at the fireplace whenever he was inside . We shook hands . His hand was large , cold , and bony . He was coughing a lot . <p> " We got our first load of wood last week , " I told him . <p> " Nothing changes , " he said . <p> " I guess I 'm a genuine teacher now , " I said . He nodded , and coughed . He did n't seem to want to talk . Still , I sat there , both of us gazing into the fire . " Any advice ? " I asked him . <p> " It does n't matter any more , " he said . " Just do the best you can . But it wo n't matter in the end . " <p> " Each generation must try , " I said . " That is the only way we can  --  " <p> " Sure , " he said , and coughed . I looked at him out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very sick man . <p> " I want to know , " I said . " I need to know . " <p> " I 've already told you all I know , " he said . <p> " Flight ? " I asked him . <p> " Where I will be soon , " he said . " Free . " <p> " There must be something else , " I said . " There has to be something else . " He was quiet . Then he coughed up phlegm and swallowed . " Do you remember Ty Robillard ? " I asked him . He stared into the fire . He did n't answer . Maybe he could not remember him . " He was a student of yours , " I told him . " A grade ahead of me . He died in the electric chair in New Orleans last Friday . " He stared into the fire and nodded his head . " Well , I better be going , " I said , and stood up . <p> He raised his head and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing but skin and bone . " You want me to say something profound ? " he asked me . " I do n't know anything profound to say to you . I wish I was a better human being . I wish the world was a better place to live in . I wish I believed in God , so that I could believe in man . But I believe in nothing . That 's all I can say to you . " <p> " And my students  --  what do I say beside reading , writing and ' rithmetic ? " <p> " Lie , " he said . " Lie as you have been taught to lie . And just pray that you will never learn the truth and pray you would not have to tell them the truth . That could be the worst day of your life . Good-bye . I 'm tired . Take care of yourself . " <p> I heard him coughing as I went out the door . <p> <p> By Ernest J. Gaines <p>        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
