<p> SETTLING SOME ISSUES IN NEWT 'S AMERICA <p> Editor  --  The Gramm Crackers ( Phil and Newt ) had better enjoy it while they can . After two years of trying to rerun the revolution of the rich ( capital gains and top marginal income tax cuts ) without the sheltering grace of Ronald Reagan , these guys will cross the Styx in ' 96 . <p> But , in the best bipartisan spirit , I would like to suggest some compromises which might let them actually do some good for the country while pursuing their social agenda . <p> We give them prayer in the schools  --  they outlaw the private school system ( no further need for religious schools ) which lets our most involved parents avoid any responsibility for the success of the public schools . <p> We give them unlimited access to automatic weapons  --  they give us the gun solution implied by the NRA ( people , not guns , kill people ) in the form of automatic death penalties for anyone convicted of using a gun during a crime . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree to break up the urban ghettos and provide every ghetto family a job and a good home in an integrated suburban neighborhood . <p> We let them outlaw abortion  --  they agree to place every resultant unwanted child in a nice upper-class Republican family . Give it a try guys ! In the meantime , I hope you do n't choke on all that smugness and self-righteousness . <p> BILL ALLEN <p> Arcata ( Humboldt County ) <p> . <p> WHITE GUYS ' REVENGE <p> Editor  --  Hooray for the election ! A pox on affirmative action ( quotas ) , diversity ( quotas ) , multiculturalism , radical feminists , illegal immigrants , the politically correct , etc. , etc . Finally , the white guys have spoken . <p> WILLIAM McSHANE <p> Novato <p> . <p> MAJORITY STAYED HOME <p> Editor  --  John Bremner states in his letter ( November 17 ) " . . . that the majority of the American public voted for . . . " He is wrong . The majority of the American public did not vote . <p> The Republicans were put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( only one-third of the people voted ) . This does not constitute a mandate or reflect the will of the people . It does reflect the will of the powerful  --  white and rich , or white and doing OK , thank you . <p> Voting should be mandatory and easy , but it could never happen in this country as people would scream " unconstitutional . " Polling places open during a 24-hour period  --  busing to the sites , if necessary . I can see the nightmarish vision for the rich  --  the lower classes having a voice in the political structure of their country ! I am tired of people saying that these people have a choice . The poor and lower-middle classes are more concerned about survival and feel that they have no power anyway . They are probably right . Money will buy you the politician and party of your choice . <p> It 's about time government was given back to the people . Outlaw lobbyists and PACs . A cap on spending and equal spending for all candidates . No more Huffingtons with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australia has mandatory voting and the average person is very informed regarding political parties and candidates . It could work here , but will never be considered by the powers that be . The wrong class of people would vote  --  and have power ! <p> WENDY MILLER <p> Novato <p> . <p> ' LEAVES OF GRASS ' <p> Editor  --  As we approach Thanksgiving , this cautionary tale is worth remembering . In Carl Sandburg 's autobiography , " Always the Young Stranger , " he tells a story that the opposition to President Grover Cleveland were spreading to demonstrate just how mean-spirited this president could be . <p> Sandburg wrote : " . . . a lean , ragged man came to the White House lawn and got down on his hands and knees and was chewing at the grass . President Cleveland from a front window saw the man and asked , ' What are you doing ? ' When the man said , ' I 'm hungry and have to eat grass , ' Cleveland told him , ' Why do n't you go around to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Is this the back yard where Newt Gingrich 's orphanage is going to be built ? <p> MURRAY KAUFMAN <p> Richmond <p> . <p> MOUNT DAVIDSON 'S CROSS <p> Editor  --  The city and county of San Francisco argued November 15 before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit that the cross atop Mount Davidson should remain in perpetuity as a historical piece of art work enjoyed by people of all faiths . Rubbish ! <p> In 1933 , the city constructed the cross  --  the largest in the country at 103 feet  --  using public funds . The site had been , and continues to be , used for Easter Sunrise and other religious services , and in fact bears a plaque proclaiming such use . It is a massive monument to the Christian religion , and it does n't belong on government property . That it was built 60 years ago makes its continued presence more egregious , not less . <p> It baffles me that San Francisco commits the resources of the city attorney 's office , a half-day 's work of Deputy City Attorney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ment , plus countless hours of preparation for the hearing , in order to defend something which is so clearly unconstitutional . As yet no cross on public property in any state has survived legal scrutiny . Let 's use our resources wisely and concede such issues without a fight . Divest of the land or tear the thing down , then get on with more pressing legal matters that face the city . <p> MARK BERGER <p> Mountain View <p> . <p> TV 'S HASH <p> EDITor  --  The two-week newspaper strike demonstrated that print as a medium is indispensable to self-government . Print is an analytic medium which appeals to reason and intellect . With print , you can dissect complicated problems and connect their component parts . No wonder dictators and demagogues fear and despise print  --  they ca n't control newspapers the way they manipulate television . <p> In contrast , the electronic hash that we get from television is designed to appeal to our gut and emotion . When TV tries to explain complicated ballot propositions within 60 seconds of sound bytes , it oversimplifies to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not deliver depth in reporting the news . If TV were around in the first century , it would have covered the Crucifixion , but it would have totally missed the rise of Christianity . <p> DENNIS G. KUBY <p> Berkeley <p> . <p> THE JOYS OF PRINT <p> Editor  --  I wholeheartedly agree with John Carman 's November 16 column on the failure of TV " news . " ( Apparently this TV columnist was so bummed out that on Thursday he eschewed comments about TV in favor of Doritos . ) <p> If there was anything the newspaper strike proved to me , it was how dismally inadequate broadcast journalism is . And let 's not forget to include radio . At 3 a.m. , the morning after the election , I awoke in a panic about Dianne Feinstein , fearing that she might have lost . I turned on KCBS , the " all-news " station . There was some spotty election stuff , but I listened for a long time in vain for something about Feinstein . The " news " caster insisted on presenting " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle of the night ! ) and even apologized once because the traffic report was four minutes late due to election coverage . <p> News coverage on both TV and radio not only did not increase or improve during the strike , it became weaker , confirming my suspicion that broadcast journalists get most of their leads from print journalists . But even at its best , TV and radio news is no match for print . You ca n't look up the information you need , you ca n't clip the articles , you ca n't refer back to them , you ca n't get any in-depth analysis , etc. , etc . I 'm so glad to have the newspapers back ! <p> KRISTIN ANUNDSEN <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> THE MISSING CORNER <p> Editor  --  I know this sounds crazy  --  but I really missed the lower right crazy corner . <p> JOHN-MICHAEL OLEXY <p> San Francisco
