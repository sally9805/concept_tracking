It 's one of those days for Daniel Hillard ( Robin Williams ) . First he gets fired from his job , then he gets fired from his marriage , pretty much for the same reason : the man has a passion , verging on the unreasonable , for protecting and nurturing children , and it makes more sensible people crazy . <P> His job is to supply the voices for a Sylvester-and-Tweety type of animated cartoon ; he loses it when the villainous cat forces the victimized bird to inhale a cigarette and Daniel insists on improvising antismoking dialogue for the sequence , so that kids in the audience clearly understand the full horror of the noxious weed . Daniel goes on to lose his marriage when he arranges to bring an entire petting zoo into his house as a birthday-party treat for one of his three children . The resulting mess is the last straw for his wife Miranda ( Sally Field , expertly walking the line between long-suffering exasperation and ineluctable affection ) . <P> A divorce court , naturally , does not look kindly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joint custody and places limits on his visitation rights that are unbearable to the best daddy in Christendom . The world does not look kindly on working moms , and Miranda can not find a suitable nanny to tend the kids while she pursues her high-powered career in interior design . Thus , out of mutual need , but without Miranda 's conscious participation , Mrs. Doubtfire  --  that is to say , Daniel in old-lady drag and affecting a Scots accent  --  is born . In this role , Daniel not only brings order to a fractured household ; he also brings a new orderliness to his own life . <P> Improbable ? Of course . All cross-dressing comedies , from Charley 's Aunt onward , are improbable . Most of the fun comes from seeing people fooled by what seems to us , who are in on the joke , a completely penetrable ruse . Curiously enough , what 's really unpersuasive about Mrs. Doubtfire  --  not to say draggy  --  is its nondrag sequences . The children are goody-goodies , without mischief or quirks , and their father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let alone major outrage . The script , by Randi Mayem Singer and Leslie Dixon , presents ideal fatherhood as a form of saintliness . <P> More immediately , they and director Chris Columbus had to contend with their star 's newfound desire ( see last year 's Toys ) to play the holy fool . Williams ' head contains a multitude of characters  --  some of them real , some of them American archetypes  --  and as a vocal quick-change artist , Williams has a unique gift not only for dead-on impersonations of these characters , but also for setting them all free on a babbling stream of consciousness . These manic monologues are impolite and utterly incorrect politically . They articulate our secret , subversive thoughts . His impersonation of Mrs. Doubtfire shows that he can sustain one of these inventions quite wonderfully . But she 's chucklesome , heartwarming , and without a subversive bone under her foam-padded bodysuit . And Daniel Hillard , of whom we see entirely too much , is winsome , childlike , too good for this world , the kind of wimped-out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
