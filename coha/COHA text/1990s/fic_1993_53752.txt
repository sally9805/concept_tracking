Do n't doubt there 's a future . Rushing toward you . <p> It was flat pavement , a busy pedestrian mall between downtown streets where she was walking in the tattered sunshine of a moist April morning when without warning the sidewalk tilted to her left , and a sharp pain like a wasp 's stinging attacked the calf of her left leg . Wide-eyed and astonished , too surprised at this time to be frightened , she did not scream . She was not the kind of person to scream , especially in a public place . <p> She fell heavily on her side . Her glasses went flying , her handsome leather handbag dropped from her fingers , the side of her face struck concrete . Her immediate thought was I 've been shot . The pain was so sudden and so absolute . <p> Strangers hurried to help . They seemed , to the stricken woman , to be materializing out of the air , with remarkable swiftness and kindness . Afterward she would count herself lucky that she was a well-dressed , well-groomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bonwit 's , its Waldenbooks , its gourmet food store and pricey boutiques , and not elsewhere on the fringes of downtown . She was lucky that her handbag was n't taken from her in the confusion of her fall and that strangers perceived her as one of their kind and not someone diseased , homeless , threatening . <p> She would remember little of her collapse afterward except its suddenness . And the terrible helplessness of her body fallen to the pavement . An ambulance arrived , its deafening siren translating to her confused brain as a lurid neon-red color . White-clad youngish medics examined her , lifted her onto a stretcher . As in a dream she was being borne aloft . A crowd of curious , snatching eyes parted for her . Alive ? Dead ? Dying ? No one , least of all the stricken woman , seemed to know . <p> And in the speeding ambulance delirious with pain and mounting terror , an incandescent bulb of pain in her left leg just below the knee but still she did not scream biting her lips to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am behaving well , look how calm and civilized . Then she was being carried into a room glaring with laser-lights , again the quick purposeful hands of strangers probed her , her blood pressure was taken and blood extracted from her limp arm and her voice faltered trying to explain to someone she could not see what had happened to her , the pain in her leg more terrible than any pain she 'd known , and a tightness in her chest and shortness of breath but she did not break down sobbing nor did she ask Am I dying ? Will I die ? nor did she beg Save me ! Her name was Grace Burkhardt and she was forty-four years old and she was a woman accustomed , as the chief administrator of a state arts council , to exercising authority but she seemed to remember none of these external facts as if they applied not to her but to another person and that person a stranger to her . She wanted to explain I am in good health , I ca n't believe this has happened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and could not speak . They would check her identification , they would contact her nearest-of-kin , they would rush her into surgery and all this would be done apart from her volition and so there was a perverse comfort in that  --  in knowing that , if she died , now , it would not be her fault . <p> Of course they saved her . Emergency surgery for a " massive " blood clot in her leg which , had it broken free and been carried to her heart , would have resulted in a pulmonary embolism . Grace Burkhardt , dead at the age of forty-four never regaining consciousness even to realize the future had been condensed into the present tense and all was over . <p> By degrees she woke moaning in the post-op room not knowing where she was but knowing that this was a place strange and frightening to her . And so cold !  --  she was shivering , her teeth chattering . She experienced a sensation of utter sick helplessness as if she were paralyzed . She could not recall the surgery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been saved from death or was even now being prepared for death . Her vision was blurred as if she were underwater . A face floated near , a stranger 's face that was at the same time familiar as a lost sister 's . <p> Help me ! she begged the face . I 'm so cold , I 'm so frightened ! <p> The face was a woman 's . The features were indistinct but the skin was strangely flushed and shiny , like something not quite fully hatched . There was a smile , thin-lipped and tentative . No-color eyes . Do n't leave me , help ! I 'm so frightened ! Grace Burkhardt begged as like a large bubble playful and elusive the face rose , lifted lighter than air to disappear through the invisible ceiling . <p> Her nearest-of-kin was a married , older sister who drove forty miles from Rochester to be with her , staying through much of the day . As news of her " emergency surgery " spread among friends , acquaintances , colleagues at the arts council , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The public self , the self that was Grace Burkhardt , and not this woman in a hospital bed hooked to an IV gurney , her left leg raised and immobile swathed in bandages , struggled to emerge . You could not have guessed that Grace Burkhardt had survived a life-threatening collapse for , on the phone , she was wry , ironic , slightly embarrassed , determined to minimalize her condition . Her eyes were ringed with fatigue , her skin waxy-white , yet her voice maintained its usual timbre , or almost . Nothing meant more to her than to take back the control she 'd lost back there in the pedestrian mall , to tell her story as if it were her own . For it was her own . You would n't believe it ! So suddenly . Yes , this morning . Yes , downtown . By ambulance . No , no warning . Yes , vascular surgery . A Dr. Rodman , do you know him ? Yes , I 'm lucky . I know . If it had to happen at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was protesting but too weak to prevail . Her head rang like the interior of a giant seashell . The pain in her leg was a balloon floating at a little distance from her  --  recognizable as her own , yet not her . My name is Grace Burkhardt , my name is Grace Burkhardt believing that this fact would save her . If anything would save her . <p> A powerful anti-coagulant drug was dripping into her veins to forestall more blood clots  --  that would save her . <p> The telephone messages . Daffodils , hyacinth , narcissus from the arts council staff , a potted pink azalea from a woman friend , another potted azalea so vividly crimson she could not look directly at it  --  these would save her . And the vascular surgeon who 'd operated on her and saved her life , who came by the room to speak with her and with her sister . And her own doctor , an internist associated with the hospital who also dropped by on his rounds . And medical insurance forms , with which her sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , she signed . You see ? I 'm fine , my mind has n't been affected at all . <p> And abruptly then , the day ended . This day that stretched dreamlike behind Grace Burkhardt as if to the very horizon to a region she could not see , nor even recall . It was evening , and she was alone . A nurse came to examine her and to give her a barbituate , a nurse 's aide , a young cocoa-skinned woman , came to take away her bedpan discreetly covered with an aluminum lid , the light in her room was switched off . She called her sister 's name not seeming to recall her sister 's actual departure . Now alone , with no witness to admire her bravery , she tasted panic . Her left leg was swollen and stiff encased in bandages and elevated above the bed to reduce the condition the surgeon called " thrombophlebitis " which was the way , she understood , that death would enter her . The crepey-soft interior of her right elbow stung with a mysterious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a lethal blood clot or death would come as a sudden massive hemorrhage that was the result of anti-coagulant medication . Though the stricken woman had not prayed in more than thirty years her parched lips moved silently Help me through the night . Help me through the night . <p> She felt a moment 's rage at the injustice  --  that she , a good person , a woman known for her intelligence and her graciousness and her dependability in all things , a woman so widely liked , yes and respected , should be in this position , a life-threatening position . And trapped . <p> Help me through the night dear God , oh please ! <p> As mercifully the contours of the room melted , the floor sank into darkness as into a pit , the powerful sleeping pill took her . <p> But then she woke , agitated and open-eyed as if she had n't slept at all . <p> As if someone had called her name  --  " Grace Burkhardt . " <p> There was a pinching sensation in her bladder , an urgent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room so cold ?  --  she woke shivering beneath a freezing sheet , a single-ply flannel blanket . The hospital by night was perceptibly cooler than by day . A ventilator rumbled , drafts of cold air passed over her . She 'd been dreaming strangely and had n't there been birds ' wings flapping overhead stirring the air against her face . . . <p> " Grace Burkhardt . " <p> The door had opened , now the door was closed . Someone had been in the room ?  --  Grace tried to sit up , frightened , but was nearly immobilized . A sudden movement awakened pain , her heart 's panicked throbbing that was pain , a sharp stinging in her right arm . Her eyes , mildly myopic , dulled with medication , moved blinking in the dark , this was an unfamiliar dark , she understood it was not her bedroom in her home nor any bedroom in her memory . The smell of disinfectant , the ventilator smell . The compression of space that was the size of a cell . She stared at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light beneath it . For some moments she tried to remember where she was , and why such discomfort and pain , her leg elevated and held fast , her heartbeat so accelerated . As if pulling out of the dark a tangled dream of such complexity , the very effort was exhausting . She heard herself moan but the sound seemed to come from another part of the room . It was self-pity , it was terror and animal pain , it was not her . I almost died , I 'm in the hospital . I 'm alone . Struggling to sit up , to raise her head which swayed dangerously heavy on her shoulders , in a sudden mad terror of choking on her own tears and saliva and the mucus rapidly forming in her sinuses . <p> She fumbled to switch on her bedside light . Her sister had bought a traveler 's digital clock in the gift shop downstairs  --  it was 2:55 a.m . She would never get through the night . <p> Yet she tried to calm herself . She was a patient in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in danger of dying . Help me ! Help me I 'm alone but she rang the bedside buzzer because she desperately needed a bedpan . The barbituate had apparently knocked her out so completely , at 8:30 p.m. , she had n't wakened until the need to urinate was painful . And she needed an extra blanket . She rang the buzzer as she 'd been instructed earlier to ring it and waited and there was no reply over the intercom so she rang it again and still there was no reply and so she counted twenty before ringing it again Where are you ? Is n't anyone there ? Please help me and this time a voice , a female voice , sounded over the intercom asking curtly what did she want and she explained her needs as clearly and politely as possible and the voice mumbled what sounded like Yes ma'am and was gone . <p> And now she waited . Waited and waited . It was three a.m. , it was 3:10 a.m. , it was 3:16 a.m . She could not get a comfortable position in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at such an angle . Each second was agony . She tried to contract her lower body , her loins , as , as a small child , she 'd tried to hold in the warm pee by pressing her thighs as tightly together as possible and not moving , hardly breathing . If she had an accident , urinating in the bed !  --  if that happened ! All her life 's history , all the striving of her very soul  --  to come to that . She felt a helpless child-anxiety she had n't recalled for nearly forty years . The child-anxiety deep in the body of the adult . Remembering the agony of being trapped in some place ( in the car , her father driving and unwilling to stop ; in school assembly where she would have had to push her way out over the legs of her classmates enduring their jeering attention and the annoyance of her teacher ) unable to get to a bathroom . The shame of it . The helplessness . <p> She rang the buzzer another , protracted time . Just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a nurse entered carrying a bedpan . <p> The night nurse , so short as to seem almost dwarfish . Hardly five feet tall . But round-bodied , with a moon face , peculiar flushed skin that was smooth and shiny as scar tissue ; small close-set damp eyes ; a thin pursed mouth . At a first glance the nurse might appear young but closer up she was obviously middle-aged , her eyes bracketed by fine white creases . " Here , lift up , like this , come on  --  " she issued instructions to the patient not so much coldly as mechanically , shoving the enamel bedpan beneath her buttocks , pulling down but not replacing the covers . Her manner was brisk and on the edge of impatience as if she and the patient had gone through this routine many times already and there was no need for coyness . <p> Grace 's teeth were chattering with cold . She whispered , flinching under the nurse 's unsmiling stare , " Thank you  --  very much . " She could not help herself but began urinating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while the nurse was still in the room , though on her way out , turning away from Grace as if in disgust . No further words , no questioning of the patient if she needed anything else , no backwards glance . But Grace Burkhardt trapped in the bed was so grateful for this awkward receptacle , this adult-size potty , in which to empty her bursting bladder , she scarcely noticed the nurse 's rudeness . If it was rudeness . <p> Her eyes smarted with the tears of gratitude and humility . Even the pain in her leg seemed to subside . The panicky numbness in her brain . But how long she urinated , in a gush of scalding liquid , then a thinning stream , ceasing and beginning again , she did not know . Minutes ? Actual minutes ? Looking at the clock finally , when the last of the urine dripped from her , she saw it was 3:38 a.m . <p> Outside the room 's single window it was night . Yet not true night for the room , being lighted now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mirror but dimly , shapes without substance or color . <p> I could die here in this room . Others have died here . <p> She 'd had a lover once who had been terrified of hospitals . An intelligent man , a reasonable man , yet , on the subject of hospitals , adamantly irrational . Hospitals are seething with germs , hospitals are where you die . Hospitals are where you have to entrust strangers with your life and you pay for the privilege . <p> A lover , and not a husband . So many years later , Grace could not be clearly remember which of them had loved more deeply , which had been more hurt . <p> Now they lived a thousand miles apart , and kept in touch by telephone , a few times a year . Thank God they no longer had any mutual friends who might tell him of her collapse , her emergency surgery . Massive blood clot . Risk of embolism . He knew her as a healthy , independent woman . Not the kind of woman you feel sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the sharp smell of urine pinched her nostrils , she waited for the night nurse , or an attendant , to come take it away . Surely they knew , at the nurses ' station ?  --  she hesitated to ring the buzzer again . <p> So she waited . It was 3:40 a.m. , it was 3:50 a.m . Finally , shyly , she rang the buzzer . There was no reply over the intercom . <p> Maybe the night nurse was making rounds . Giving medication , checking patients . Maybe , routinely , she would be back in a few minutes . Maybe she would bring an extra blanket . <p> At four a.m . Grace rang the buzzer again . There was a sound of static or shrill voices , then silence . " Hello ? Hello  --  " her voice was plaintive , faltering . <p> Could die here in this room . Others have died here . <p> The enamel bedpan was pressing into the soft flesh of her buttocks . The elevation of her leg , and its stiffness , made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was  --  freezing . A continual draft from the window and another , smelling of something dank , metallic , unclean , from the air vent overhead . <p> In desperation she wondered if she could remove the damned bedpan herself . But set it where ? On the bedside table , only a few inches away ? And what if she spilled it , as certainly she would ? it was impossible to lift herself and to remove the bedpan at the same time . And now her leg , the entire left side of her body , was throbbing with pain . <p> She rang the buzzer again , trying not to panic . Though the intercom was dead she begged for help  --  " Please , can you come ? I need medication , I 'm in pain . I need a blanket  --  " <p> If the night nurse withheld the painkiller from her , what would she do ? <p> Do n't be absurd . Why , would a complete stranger want to hurt you resolved not to give in to panic though she was trapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mercy of the nursing staff . Whom she knew it would be a mistake to antagonize , especially so early in her hospitalization  --  Dr. Rodman had told her she might have to be here a week or more , thrombophlebitis is a serious condition . And her sister , meaning well , had told her alarming tales of negligent and even hostile nurses and attendants at big-city hospitals as a way of assuring Grace that here , by contrast , in this suburban hospital , she would receive better treatment . <p> At night , the hospital seemed very different than it did by day . It was closed to visitors until 8:30 a.m . In a panicked fantasy , Grace imagined a fire , at once she could smell smoke , and she , here , trapped , crippled with pain , paralyzed . If she wrenched her leg free , would its wound be torn open ?  --  would she begin to bleed ? She shuddered , whimpering to herself . Trapped ! Trapped on a bedpan ! It was ludicrous , it was laughable ! Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soak the bed . <p> She thought she heard the door being opened , the doorknob turning  --  but no . If there were footsteps out in the corridor they were gone now . <p> Strange how the hospital was not much quieter at night . A different and more mysterious kind of sound prevailed  --  a ceaseless churning like a motor turning over , never quite starting ; a deeper throbbing like a jazz downbeat , but arrhythmic , irregular . Beyond the vibrating of the ventilator there were distant voices . Pleading , crying . Help me . Help . Me . Help me . The voices overlapped , drowning one another out . <p> When she stopped breathing to listen more closely , the voices faded . <p> Grace did not want to think whose voices these were . <p> It seemed to her that she could feel tiny blood clots forming in her afflicted leg , like rain at the point at which it turns to sleet . If a single one of these clots broke free into her bloodstream it would be carried to her heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> What it is , what finality  --  to fall to the ground , on dirty pavement , at the feet of strangers . Grace Burkhardt now knew . <p> She pressed the buzzer another time . The intercom remained dead . <p> " Help me ! Where are you ! " <p> She was agitated , on the brink of hysteria and yet , somehow , she was falling asleep . The room began to shift and lose its contours ; the light rapidly fading as if sucked down a drain . The bed-pan filled with cooling piss , her piss , began to melt , too , its hard enamel warmed by her body . She 'd drawn the inadequate covers up to her chin and her eyes were starkly open waiting for the night nurse to return and suddenly she saw  --  was it possible ?  --  the night nurse was back , had been back for some time , evidently ?  --  standing motionless , watching her , just inside the door . <p> " Grace Burkhardt . " <p> The nurse enunciated these syllables in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burkhardt . " <p> Grace whispered , frightened , " Yes ? Do you know me ? " <p> It was as if she 'd never heard her own name before . Never heard its strangeness before . <p> The nurse 's thin lips stretched in a smile . Her " <p> Grace stared . Quick as a thread pulled through the eye of a needle and out again she knew  --  knew the woman , or knew the girl the woman had been ; but she remembered no name ; and did not remember that face . She heard herself saying , quickly , " No . I 've never been in this hospital before . I 've never  --  " Her voice trailed off weakly . <p> There was an awkward pause . The nurse continued to stand motionless , arms folded tight across her breasts . Her peculiar shiny-smooth skin that looked like scar tissue , or like something incompletely hatched , was the color of spoiled cantaloupe . Her lips were bemused , childish in derision . " You would n't remember , Grace Burkhardt . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trapped in bed . Her stiff throbbing leg , her arm hooked to an IV apparatus . She 's mad , she 's come to injure me though smiling at the nurse , trying to smile . As if this was an ordinary exchange . Or might become so , if she smiled the right way , if she spoke the right words . " I  --  ca n't see very well . My glasses  --  my eyes  --  Do I know you ? " <p> The nurse made a derisive laughing sound though her eyes showed no mirth . She jerked her chin at the bed " You 're finished there , eh ? Grace Burkhardt ? So you want me to take it away ? " <p> Quickly , apologetically , Grace said , " If you would , please  --  " <p> " Registered nurses are n't required to touch bedpans . " <p> " Then  --  an attendant ? Could you call one ? " <p> The nurse shook her head slowly . Bemused , disgusted . Still she stood without moving , arms folded across her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grace saw  --  who ? It had been years . Half her lifetime . No ! No I do n't know you ! She whispered , pleading , " Please , I 'm helpless . I need medication , I 'm in pain . And this bedpan  --  " <p> " You 're helpless . You need help . So what ? ' Grace Burkhardt . ' " <p> " Why do you keep saying my name ? Do you know me ? " <p> " Why do n't you say my name ? Do n't you know me ? " <p> Grace stared , and swallowed hard . I am a good person , I am well-liked , respected . Recalling how through the years of her career , in her several administrative positions at Wells College , and at the State University at Buffalo , and more recently on the New York State Council of the Arts , she 'd been praised for her industry , her fair-mindedness , her diplomacy ; her intelligence , her warmth , her inconspicuous competency . Had n't she overheard , to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff members at the arts council speaking of Grace Burkhardt warmly , comparing her favorably to her male predecessor . I am an adult now , I am a professional woman , I am no one you know . Grace heard herself saying in a voice of forced surprise , with a forced smile , " Harriet  --  ? Is it  --  Zimmer ? " <p> The nurse said curtly , " Zink . Harriet Zink . " <p> " Of course . Harriet Zink . " <p> Grace should have exclaimed what a coincidence , after so many years , twenty-five ? twenty-six ? so you became a nurse after all , you did n't give up , how wonderful , Harriet , I 'm happy for you  --  remembering vaguely that Harriet Zink , one of her roommates for part of her freshman year at the State University at Albany had been enrolled in nursing school . But when she drew breath to speak a wave of nausea swept over her . She whispered , "  --  Please , I need help . My leg  --  the pain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word pain , the night nurse became more animated . She came closer to Grace , peering at her curiously , almost hungrily . Grace had not given Harriet Zink a thought , or hardly a thought , in twenty-six years , and now  --  what an irony ! The mere face of Harriet Zink , with that childish moon face , now middle-aged  --  how repulsive ! Grace recalled her ex-roommate 's prominent front teeth , the peculiar blush of her skin , her unnerving manner that was both groveling and insolent  --  oh , unmistakable . <p> They 'd lived on the fourth , top floor of Ailey Hall , one of the older residences south of campus near the university hospital . Entering freshman , class of 1967 . They were of the same generation glancing at the other 's third finger , left hand , to see if there was a wedding band . Neither wore one . <p> Harriet Zink was asking in a bright , mock-earnest voice , " How is Jilly Herman ? " and Grace Burkhardt had to stop to think , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impatiently , " Grace Burkhardt 's roomie Jilly Herman  --  how is she ? " Grace stared at her , perplexed . I am dreaming this , am I dreaming this trying not to show the fear she felt as Harriet Zink went on derisively , " The one with the cute blond cuds , Jilly Herman , " gesturing at her own steely-gray hair with exaggerated wriggly fingers , "  --  the one with the cute ass . " <p> Grace said , in a faltering voice , "  --  I have n't seen or heard from Jill Herman in twenty years . " Though this was true it sounded weak , like a lie . <p> Harriet Zink said suspiciously , " You have n't ? You expect me to believe that ? " When Grace began to protest she cut her off with childish vehemence , " Oh no ! I do n't believe that ! Gracie Burkhardt and lilly Herman were best friends . I bet you still are . " <p> These words were mocking , singsong . Grace tried to maintain her smile which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , after freshman year , she and Jill went their separate ways , speaking earnestly as if this exchange in the middle of the night in such circumstances was not at all extraordinary but normal , and no occasion for alarm . But Harriet Zink interrupted , " And what about Linda Mecky , and Sandy McGuire , and Dolly Slosson , " spitting out these names Grace scarcely recalled , and had hardly given a thought to since graduation , "  --  Barbara West , Sue Ferguson  --  " the names of freshman girls who 'd roomed on the fourth floor of the old sandstone residence hall in the fall of 1963 . <p> There had been six rooms on the floor , all doubles except for the largest which was a triple to which Grace Burkhardt and Jill Herman and Harriet Zink were assigned . But Harriet Zink did n't arrive on campus until October , twelve days late ; there 'd been an " emergency crisis " in her family . ( The residence advisor hinted that Harriet 's mother had died , and there 'd been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring up the subject unless Harriet initiated it herself  --  which she was never to do . ) By the time the mysterious Harriet Zink arrived at Ailey Hall , friendships and alliances had been formed among the fourth-floor girls in that quick , desperate way in which such relationships are formed in new , disorienting surroundings . There had not seemed space enough for another girl . There had not seemed any need for another girl . And there was the problem , too , of Harriet Zink . <p> I tried to be nice to you . I did what I could . How am I to blame . <p> Harriet Zink was demanding to know what of these other girls , and Grace Burkhardt was trying to explain she really knew nothing of them , she was n't in contact with any of them , but Harriet Zink seemed not to believe her , and angry that she should be lying . Grace tried to explain that most of them had only been friends during freshman year and that had been a kind of accident , stuck away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the center of campus life , she tried to evoke the shabby comedy of Ailey Hall with its falling plaster and its leaky windows and its cockroaches , but Harriet Zink kept interrupting , pursuing her own line of inquiry . " Do you remember what you did to me ? You , and your friends ? " Her face was heated and her small eyes brightly moist . There were half-moons of perspiration beneath the arms of her snug-fitting white nylon uniform and Grace remembered across the abyss of twenty-six years a snug-fitting clumsily homemade red plaid jumper of Harriet Zink 's whose underarms were permanently stained . " Do n't say you do n't remember , Grace Burkhardt ! " <p> Grace frowned , innocently perplexed . She was miserable in her bed , her leg pounding in pain , her head pounding , and , dear God , the sharp smell of urine penetrating the covers , had she spilled some of the urine into the bed , she bit her lip to keep from sobbing I must not let her see I 'm afraid of her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , please , Harriet , I do n't  --  " which brought the angry little woman closer to the bed , how like a dwarf she was , so short , and stouter now that she 'd been at the age of eighteen , her face rounder , puffier , and that mouth made you think of a slug , always moving , working . Harriet Zink said in a tone of near-dignity , " I remember . I still dream about it sometimes . " <p> Grace said softly , " Harriet , I 'm sorry . " <p> " Huh ! How can you be sorry , if you do n't remember ? " <p> " Please , I 'm in pain . If you could help me  --  " <p> " I was in pain . You did n't help me . " <p> "  --  I need medication . Painkiller . Please . And this bedpan  --  please could you take it away  --  " <p> " I told you : registered nurses are n't required to take away-bedpans . That 's not our job . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore your clothes until they were filthy . You smelled . You stank . You cried yourself to sleep every night . How am I to blame ! Grace knew , yet did n't know : could n't quite remember . It was so long ago , it was like a bad dream , not her own dream but another 's . What exactly had happened between the time Harriet Zink , who like Grace Burkhardt was from a farming family in the central part of the state , and the weekend before Thanksgiving when she moved out of Ailey Hall , dropped out of nursing school . Disappeared . I tried to be nice to you . I did what I could . How am I to blame ! <p> In a lowered , quavering voice Harriet Zink was saying , " You and Jill Herman , you would n't talk to me . I 'd be there in the room and you 'd send each other signals . Look right through me . Like I was dirt . If I came into the lounge you 'd all stop talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I came into the cafeteria where you were all sitting you 'd look away and freeze me out . You knew about my mother and how I cried at night and that was funny to you was n't it . Everything about me was funny to you was n't it . I was late starting classes and behind on all my work and you could see how scared I was , I could n't sleep and I could n't keep food down and all of you knew it , all twelve of you , but it was just a joke to you was n't it  --  that I wanted to die . " <p> Grace Burkhardt could not believe what she was hearing . She said , weakly , " Not me , Harriet . Not me . I tried  --  " <p> " Oh sure ! You 'd say to them sometimes , ' Let her alone .

You tried to stop them from the worst of what they did but you did n't try hard enough . " <p> " Harriet , I 'm sorry . We were so young , then  --  so ignorant . " <p> " You were n't ignorant . You were a scholarship student . " <p> " We did n't mean to be cruel " <p> " Yes you did ! You meant to be cruel , " Harriet Zink said , with angry satisfaction . " It made you happy , all of you , to be cruel . " <p> " Harriet , no  --  " <p> Harriet Zink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face now brightly flushed , recounting incidents Grace Burkhardt had long since forgotten , if indeed she 'd ever known . She tried to remember how long pathetic Harriet Zink had actually roomed with her and Jill Herman before moving downstairs to a single room near the resident advisor 's suite  --  that room kept in readiness for just such an emergency . Yes , it 's so . It made us happy . Our cruelty . Our loathing for the true freak among us . After Harriet Zink dropped out of school , having failed more of her midterms , the girls of the fourth floor , including several nursing students to whom she 'd been a particular embarrassment , had not missed her . Or , if they missed her , they did not dwell upon her absence . They did not consider its significance . It had nothing to do with them , did it ?  --  they were normal , they were adjusting to college life . After Harriet Zink moved out of their room Grace and Jill cleaned it as they 'd never cleaned it before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit record Jill played repeatedly on her turntable , airing out the room , windows open to a bright dry autumn day , a breeze lifting papers on their desks . Gaily they vacuumed , they scrubbed . Their door was wide open to welcome their friends . Sad to say , I 'm on my way , wo n't be back for many a day but their lifted voices , their shining eyes , were anything but sad . The third desk , in the corner , was bare . The third bed , beneath the tilt of the eave , was bare . Later , Grace would cover the bed with a beautiful afghan quilt knitted by her grandmother . The third desk was used by both girls . They were particularly grateful for the extra closet space . <p> Now Harriet Zink , middle-aged , squat body in her nurse 's uniform solid as a little barrel , was leaning over Grace Burkhardt in her bed , saying , in disgust , " ' Grace Burkhardt '  --  you were the evil one among them because you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your face . And right now ! You knew , but you would n't help me , you would n't be my friend . " <p> Grace said stammering , " Harriet , I 'm  --  I did n't  --  " her eyes brimming with tears of shame , "  --  forgive me ! " She was so frightened she 'd leaned away from the angry woman and caused the IV needle to pop out of her vein . <p> There was a pause . Harriet Zink stared at Grace , leaning so close over her that Grace could see specks of hazel in the iris of her eyes ; a glimmer of gold fillings in her mouth . Harriet was breathing harshly , like an overweight woman who has climbed a stairs too quickly . Yet her expression shifted suddenly , turned unexpectedly thoughtful . She said , with the air of one making a discovery , " Yes , I can forgive you , Grace Burkhardt . I 'm a Christian woman . In my heart I 'm empowered to forgive . " She nodded gravely , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what she would do , she was taking pleasure in it . " When I saw you here , Grace Burkhardt , and I thought , ' Am I strong enough to forgive that woman ? Even with Jesus ' help , am I strong enough ? ' I did n't know . But now I know . I am strong enough , I can forgive . " She spoke with such sudden pride , it was as if sunshine flooded the room . <p> In this way , as a terrified Grace Burkhardt would not have anticipated , the siege ended . <p> For a long time after the night nurse left the room Grace lay unmoving too shocked to think even How am I to blame ! I tried , I did try incredulous thinking Evil  --  me ? Of all people  --  me ? The woman is a religious maniac . She was too agitated to sleep yet somehow must have slept if only briefly and then waking opening her eyes wide and amazed that it was still night ? still night ? when in her dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penance and her eyes were seared and aching . <p> She struggled to sit up . She could breathe better , sitting up . Her leg throbbed with pain , pain was like a wave that washed over her and through her leaving her exhausted but wakeful . The bedside lamp was still on . She 'd thought the night nurse had turned it off . In the room 's single window fiat , ghostly reflections floated . She could not identify her own among them . <p> The night nurse , after her mad outburst , had treated Grace Burkhardt kindly . Or , if not kindly , with a brisk businesslike efficiency . She 'd replaced the needle in Grace 's bruised right arm , and saw that the IV fluid was dripping into her vein . She called an aide , a young black girl , to bring an extra blanket and to carry away , at last , the bedpan . But , as she explained , she could not give Grace any of the painkiller Oxycodone prescribed for her by Dr. Rodman because the next dosage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day staff would be on duty and another nurse would take care of her . Thank you , Grace murmured , thank you so much , Harriet , humbled and grateful as a chastened child but the night nurse merely shrugged as if embarrassed and then she was gone . <p> It was only 4:54 a.m . The extra blanket seemed not to make much difference  --  Grace was still shivering , the room was still very cold . There was a smell of something close , damp , unclean like mold . There was a faint smell or urine . Help me , help but Grace had already rung the buzzer and she understood that she 'd already been helped and that there was no more help . She decided to sit up sleepless through the remainder of this terrible night though believing , with the resigned half-humor of the damned , that it would never end . Never would it be dawn and never the miraculous hour of seven a.m. and a respite from pain . Thinking , I am not that strong . I am not evil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I could not forgive . When she looked at the little digital clock her sister had bought her she saw it was 4:56 a.m . <p> <p> <p> By JOYCE CAROL OATES <p>
