I. INTRODUCTION <p> Ground level ozone pollution is a major constituent of smog. 1 It is a highly reactive and extremely corrosive gas that adversely affects both animal and plant life. 2 Scientists have long recognized that exposure to elevated levels of ozone is dangerous for people with impaired respiratory systems and for children , and unhealthy for the population as a whole. 3 Although it is difficult to quantify the cumulative societal damage to human health caused by exposure to ozone , the effects , ranging from temporarily impaired lung performance to permanent lung damage , impose a heavy toll. 4 Scientific studies have also established that ground level ozone causes serious damage to the economy through reduced agricultural crop productivity. 5 In addition , experts have documented the detrimental effects of ozone on trees , and extrapolate that the effects of elevated ozone levels on the environment as a whole are significant. 6 The cross-media potential for pollution transport has recently received scrutiny as scientists establish the causal connection between water pollution and air pollution. 7 In light of these dangers and costs to society , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to regulate ozone as a criteria pollutant under the Clean Air Act ( CAA ) , 9 to establish a National Ambient Air Quality Standard ( NAAQS ) for ground level ozone , 10 and to restrict emissions of ozone 's precursor chemicals . <p> Unlike other pollutants , ozone does not emanate directly from automobiles or other sources . Ozone results instead from the combination of oxygen , nitrogen oxides ( NOx ) and various hydrocarbon pollutants called volatile organic compounds ( VOCs ) in the atmosphere. 11 Combination of these chemicals in conjunction with the energy provided by sunlight12 produces ozone through a series of photochemical reactions. 13 An ozone molecule therefore typically forms in the atmosphere at some distance removed from the automobiles , smokestacks , or other sources that emitted its constituent parts. 14 The precise distance from those sources at which the molecule forms and the subsequent course the molecule follows are subject to a complex set of chemical , topographical , and meteorological variables. 15 Through computer modeling , scientists are able to estimate the suspected rate of ozone 's creation and analyze its subsequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phenomenon , known as " ozone transport , " poses major pollution concerns in the United States and raises significant challenges in statutory implementation for EPA. 17 <p> Ground level ozone is the most pervasive air pollution problem in the nation. 18 Despite technological advances in pollution control , primarily through measures that reduce emissions from automobiles , increases in population and in per capita consumption of energy have kept ambient ozone levels high. 19 Large portions of the United States , both urban and rural , have ozone levels that exceed the ozone NAAQS. 20 Particularly in the northeast corridor of the United States from Virginia to Maine , the incidence of days with ozone levels that exceed the standard is growing. 21 In 1993 , all states in the Northeast Ozone Transport Region ( Northeast OTR ) , 22 except Vermont , had more violations than in 1992 , and many states had twice the number of violations that occurred in those same areas in the previous year. 23 These violations occurred in substantial part because of ozone transport from other states in the Northeast OTR or beyond. 24 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a combination of meterological conditions and emissions reductions. 25 <p> The summer of 1995 , however , brought numerous incidents of ozone nonattainment. 26 Many states with nonattainment areas around the country had petitioned EPA for redesignation to attainment status27 because ozone levels had been relatively low for two of the requisite three years needed to establish compliance. 28 The 1995 heat wave rendered the petitions moot as many of these areas suffered repeated ozone violations. 29 Rather than redesignation to attainment , some moderate nonattainment areas may instead face elevation to serious nonattainment status for failure to meet the NAAQS in the three years prior to their 1996 attainment deadline. 30 Critics of the 1990 CAA have argued that Congress unduly skewed the statute because of the heat wave and pollution crisis of the summer of 1988. 31 The summer of 1995 demonstrated that 1988 was not merely a rare aberration like the proverbial " hundred year flood " and that the country continues to have a serious ozone transport problem. 32 <p> As both the number and extent of violations of the ozone NAAQS increase , an ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to unhealthy levels of ozone on a regular basis. 33 Moreover , recent studies suggest that the current ozone NAAQS may be too permissive to protect human health , particularly for individuals already suffering from an impaired ability to breathe or individuals who exercise or work outdoors. 34 The true percentage of the population endangered by ozone may well be higher than currently recognized. 35 <p> EPA is currently considering changing the ozone NAAQS. 36 An independent scientific review committee has examined the available data and recommended that EPA modify the standard to provide a more adequate margin of safety , especially given the effects of long-term exposure to ozone not currently addressed by the standard. 37 The exact nature and degree of modification to the ozone NAAQS EPA decides upon will have far reaching impacts. 38 If EPA lowers the ozone NAAQS to reflect a more conservative standard for the pollutant to provide greater protection , one could assume that the number of violations would increase in many areas in the Northeast OTR. 39 This increase in violations probably would create a concomitant increase in the number of nonattainment areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in many areas. 40 <p> Despite the emerging ozone crisis recognized by lawmakers , scientists , environmentalists , and others , the CAA has thus far proven an unwieldy tool to address a complex problem. 41 Among the shortcomings of the CAA is its failure to address adequately the ozone transported across state boundaries by the forces of nature. 42 It is obvious that air travels everywhere unimpeded by the man-made constructs of jurisdictional borders. 43 Paradoxically , the CAA generally treats each state as a separate unit and requires determinations regarding a state 's compliance with the NAAQS as though the state were in a vacuum. 44 This approach is a result of the principle of cooperative federalism upon which Congress constructed the CAA. 45 Following this principle , the federal government sets standards and state governments develop and implement plans to meet the standards. 46 <p> This fragmented approach to ozone abatement invites inconsistencies in the methods and degrees of ozone precursor control exercised by different states. 47 Moreover , conflicting economic or political objectives of different jurisdictions potentially exacerbate the level of ozone transport . For example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NOx control measures on the grounds that NOx reductions will result in more ozone , not less , in downwind areas. 48 Some downwind states contend that their citizens will suffer from additional ozone transport as a result of such an exemption. 49 <p> Over the last three decades , Congress has gradually strengthened the CAA to address interstate transport of criteria pollutants in general and ozone in particular. 50 In the last three revisions of the CAA , Congress has given EPA an increasingly central role in regulating interstate transport by modifying the statutory standards for EPA 's review of state implementation plans ( SIPs ) . 51 Congress still has not , however , addressed the underlying fundamental questions of how to apportion the nation 's air resources among states in the context of air pollutant transport prevention. 52 The statute thus does not clearly indicate how EPA should resolve transport disputes . Because EPA oversees the development of SIPs for all states , EPA must implement the provisions of the CAA to prevent ozone transport in accordance with an incomplete statutory mandate . <p> EPA 's implementation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many quarters . Industry often complains that the statute imposes unreasonable burdens and interferes with competitiveness. 53 Environmental groups contend that EPA has not interpreted and enforced the transport provisions aggressively enough. 54 Some states assert that the statute unconstitutionally usurps state powers. 55 Citizens are vehemently opposed to some control measures mandated by the CAA to reduce ozone precursors and ozone transport. 56 Amid this criticism , EPA must act in accordance with the provisions of the statute or , in the case of statutory ambiguity , divine congressional intent from sources other than the statute. 57 EPA has striven to implement the CAA " flexibly " to accommodate the more conservative and less conservationist political atmosphere of Washington resulting from the November , 1994 , congressional elections. 58 Given the recent calls in Congress to amend the CAA or to shackle EPA , a reexamination of the ozone transport provisions is now appropriate. 59 <p> This paper will first discuss the efforts by Congress and EPA to address interstate air pollutant transport under the CAA up to and including the 1990 Amendments. 60 Second , it will illustrate how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ozone transport . Third , this paper will explore some recent EPA efforts to moderate harsh effects of the ozone transport provisions upon states . Fourth , it will describe some bills currently before Congress that address directly the problem of ozone transport and its ramifications for states . Finally , this paper will argue that Congress could amend the 1990 CAA to rectify statutory and implementation problems for downwind states , yet continue to encourage expeditious attainment of the NAAQS . Specifically , this paper will suggest that downwind states need three forms of statutory relief : ( i ) alleviation of the draconian punishment for being merely the recipient of ozone from upwind states ; ( ii ) creation of a meaningful mechanism to initiate prompt EPA action against upwind states that do not cooperate to control ozone transport across state or regional borders ; and ( iii ) clarification that Section 110(a) ( 2 ) ( D ) authorizes EPA to force states to reduce ozone precursor emissions below the level of the NAAQS if necessary to prevent transport . <p> On the latter point , this paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guidance to EPA concerning how the agency should allocate air resources or should state unequivocally that EPA has explicit authority to devise and implement the proper resource allocation formula . Without clearer guidance in the CAA , the ozone transport problem will follow the paradigm of the tragedy of the commons , in which self-interested users ruin shared resources like the ambient air because they do not suffer the full consequences of their actions. 61 Overall , this paper will suggest the futility of continued treatment of state borders as legal fences against transport , and the need for states of the Northeast OTR and elsewhere to cooperate to resolve transport issues . II . OZONE TRANSPORT UNDER THE CAA <p> The vexing problem of interstate pollution provided one of the most compelling arguments in favor of federal regulation of pollution rather than continued state and local control of the issue. 62 The pernicious effects of cross-boundary pollution and the failure of common law remedies to resolve disputes among neighboring states prompted Congress to intervene under the commerce clause power of the U.S. Constitution. 63 Three decades later , the issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largely unresolved. 64 Congress has grappled with pollution transport through three revisions of the CAA in 1970 , 1977 , and 1990 . The successive amendments and EPA 's implementation of the provisions illustrate some of the intransigent problems inherent in attempts to remedy ozone transport and suggest areas for further improvement . A. The 1970 Clean Air Act <p> Prior to the 1970 CAA , Congress addressed the issue of cross-boundary pollution or pollution transport through the mechanism of interstate conferences. 65 Congress contemplated that states sharing a common border with significant transboundary pollution would voluntarily engage in conferences in which they ostensibly would sort out such problems among themselves. 66 The federal government 's involvement consisted primarily of mediation and facilitation . If the parties could not reach agreement , the federal government could itself seek to abate the interstate pollution in federal court. 67 The conference system proved cumbersome and ineffective to resolve the thorny technological , economic , and political issues of pollution abatement between states. 68 <p> In the 1970 CAA , 69 Congress directed EPA to take a more active role in the regulation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generate a SIP in which the state had to specify the enforceable pollution control measures it would undertake to reduce emissions and comply with the NAAQS. 71 The statute instructed EPA to approve a state 's SIP if it contained certain minimum required plan elements designed to help the state attain the NAAQS . Section 110(a) ( 2 ) ( E ) of the 1970 CAA directed EPA to approve a SIP if , among other things , it included provisions for " intergovernmental cooperation " to counter transported pollutants that might " interfere " with attainment or maintenance of the NAAQS in other jurisdictions. 72 <p> The statute expressly instructed states to take the necessary measures to " insure " against the effects of transported pollutants on neighboring states , albeit indirectly through EPA 's SIP approval process. 73 EPA interpreted the statute 's exhortation less aggressively . The agency concluded that Congress merely intended to foster interstate cooperation through the exchange of information and did not intend to require a state to halt emissions at the insistence of a neighboring state. 74 EPA therefore promulgated a regulation that only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information on " factors " that might affect the air quality of other states. 75 Like earlier attempts to control air pollution through interstate cooperation , this approach relied upon a degree of altruism among states. 76 <p> Environmental groups disputed EPA 's interpretation of the statute and attempted to compel EPA to enforce Section 110 to abate interstate pollution . The Natural Resources Defense Council ( NRDC ) formally challenged EPA 's position in connection with the approval of a SIP for Iowa. 77 NRDC argued that the requirement of an interstate information exchange was inadequate to prevent interstate pollution that interfered with attainment or maintenance in other jurisdictions in contravention of the statute. 78 NRDC further contended that the mere exchange of information would not substitute for binding interstate agreements or compacts to abate transboundary emissions. 79 <p> A federal appellate court rejected NRDC 's position , holding that the information exchange was a legitimate means to attain " intergoverumental cooperation " as contemplated by Congress in the statute. 80 Possession of the information , the court reasoned , would enable states to develop their respective SIPs to address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective , the court relied on the fundamental tenet of administrative law that the agency acting within the scope of its statutory authority had discretion to determine " what degree of governmental cooperation and other measures are necessary to insure noninterference with the attainment and maintenance of national standards . " 81 <p> The NRDC case illuminates three continuing debates in transport policy : ( i ) the degree to which EPA should control the resolution of disputes between states ; ( ii ) the degree to which upwind and downwind states should bear responsibility for theft neighbor 's air quality ; and ( iii ) the degree to which the CAA should require states to work together to resolve common problems . The first issue concerns the appropriate extent of EPA 's role in transport disputes . Congress based the CAA on the principle of cooperative federalism , i.e. , the federal government sets minimum standards and the state governments enact local laws to implement those standards. 82 The inevitable tension between federal and state power generates disputes as to the proper sphere of influence of each sovereign in transport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to each state through the SIP process . At the other end of the spectrum , EPA could merely act as a disinterested mediator between states . The CAA contains a fundamental dichotomy because the states ostensibly set their own policies to meet national objectives , yet EPA is the final arbiter of appropriate policies. 84 Because of this structure , some critics believe that Congress intends EPA to take a more proactive role. 85 Others believe that EPA should let states resolve transport issues. 86 This issue was at the heart of the NRDC suit challenging the agency interpretation of the 1970 CAA , and the issue remains a central theme in ozone transport disputes. 87 <p> Another recurring motif of transport policy is the tension between the rights of upwind and downwind states . The 1970 CAA placed EPA in an untenable position . Section 110(a) ( 2 ) ( E ) provided that EPA was to approve SIPs with necessary measures to avoid interference with attainment or maintenance of the NAAQS in another area. 88 The 1970 CAA did not , however , explain what would constitute such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any given situation . It was unclear , for example , whether EPA was to allow an upwind jurisdiction to emit any amount of ozone precursors if it would prevent the downwind state from using the full " quota " of emissions represented by the NAAQS. 89 Congress sidestepped the divisive political decisions regarding allocation of limited air resources between states , and put EPA in the difficult position of arbiter of the relative fights of upwind and downwind jurisdictions . How upwind and downwind states should share finite air resources remains a difficult and largely unaddressed question ? EPA continues to bear primary responsibility for resolving disputes concerning the allocation of air resources . <p> The third perennial issue concerns the proper format for state cooperation to solve shared transport problems . At the time of the 1970 CAA , the statute created a mechanism for states to meet voluntarily to hammer out solutions between one another . EPA 's role through the SIP process was only to insure that states provided for intergovernmental cooperation . Critics suggested that stronger measures such as binding agreements or compacts were necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require greater interstate cohesiveness among adjacent states. 92 The degree to which the CAA should obligate states to work together is an issue of continuing concern. 93 <p> EPA 's interpretation of Section 110(a) ( 2 ) ( E ) under the 1970 CAA effectively transferred to the states the duty to resolve interstate transport disputes . After judicial approval of its interpretation of the statute , EPA continued to implement its authority under the Section as though it was merely to encourage states to resolve transport problems along lines comparable to the discredited conference method . B. The 1977 Clean Air Act <p> In the 1977 CAA , 94 Congress attempted to correct the agency and judicial interpretation of Section 110(a) ( 2 ) ( E ) 95 by amending the statute to provide that SIPs must include provisions prohibiting state sources from interfering with attainment or maintenance of NAAQS in any other jurisdictions. 96 In addition , Congress added a new Section 126 that empowered states to petition EPA for a finding that a major source in another state emitted or would have emitted a transported air pollutant in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 97 Upon such a finding , Section 126 authorized EPA to restrict or stop the emissions from certain existing sources or to forbid construction of new or modified sources. 98 Both provisions gave EPA additional tools to force states to remedy cross-boundary transport of pollutants , but the limitations of the provisions overwhelmed the benefits. 99 <p> The 1977 amendments to Section 110(a) ( 2 ) ( E ) expressly expanded EPA 's authority to disapprove a SIP for failure to limit emissions that interfered with attainment or maintenance in another state . Whereas the 1970 CAA version of the Section merely instructed EPA vaguely to insure that there were provisions to avoid interference with downwind attainment or maintenance , the 1977 CAA directed EPA to approve a SIP only if there were specific prohibitions to prevent such emissions . The distinction is subtle , but it reflected a greater concern that one state not adversely affect another . <p> The limitations of Section 110(a) ( 2 ) ( E ) , however , rendered it ineffective as a mechanism to address ozone transport . First , Section 110(a) ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to EPA regarding the amount of emissions that would constitute a violation of the provision. 100 The statute required EPA to insure that the SIP had adequate measures to " prevent " nonattainment , but it provided no guidance as to the meaning of this term. 101 It was unclear whether a violation would occur only if the upwind state sent the downwind state air that already violated the NAAQS or if the upwind state sent the downwind state any amount of ozone that contributed to nonattainment. 102 Commentators noted that a literal reading would inevitably lead to inequities , for example , a developed downwind state with polluted air could forever block an upwind state from developing. 103 As in the 1970 CAA , Congress left the question of what degree of transport mattered and what states must do to alleviate transport to the discretion of EPA. 104 EPA filled this void by developing its policy on an ad hoc basis through the Section 126 proceedings discussed below . <p> Second , the provision continued to refer only to the emissions from stationary sources rather than the wider universe of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combined groups of sources that together might emit large amounts of transported pollutants. 105 Omission of mobile sources in particular precluded EPA from finding a violation of the provision in the event of transport of ozone precursor chemicals from automobiles , the predominant source of transported ozone in many nonattainment areas. 106 The restriction of the prohibition to individual stationary sources thus drastically curtailed the number of situations in which EPA could use Section 110(a) ( 2 ) ( E ) to remedy transport . <p> Finally , Section 110(a) ( 2 ) ( E ) provided no mechanism for initiation of EPA review of SIP provisions by affected states. 107 Unlike Section 126 , states could not directly petition EPA under Section 110(a) ( 2 ) ( E ) to assess whether another state 's emissions violated the SIP requirements to prevent transport . States could submit comments in connection with an agency rulemaking to approve a SIP already underway , but could not initiate that review by EPA . This left only the citizen suit provision in CAA Section 304 , 108 and the right to challenge an agency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 109 as possible means to direct EPA 's attention to a transport problem . <p> As a result of these limitations , Section 110(a) ( 2 ) ( E ) of the 1977 CAA proved of limited utility to states . After the 1977 revisions , Connecticut attempted to stop EPA from allowing a Long Island , New York , power plant to burn high sulfur fuel. 110 Connecticut alleged that the plant 's high stacks emitted sulfur dioxide and particulates that adversely affected the air quality across Long Island Sound. 111 EPA assessed Connecticut 's claim through the notice and comment rulemaking process for the plant 's special exemption and denied the state 's requested relief. 112 Accordingly , the state challenged EPA 's final rule alleging that it violated Section 110(a) ( 2 ) ( E ) . 113 <p> The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit explored Connecticut 's varied complaints regarding EPA 's approval of the New York plant 's special exemption to use high sulfur fuel. 114 Although the Second Circuit was sympathetic to Connecticut and acknowledged that a key assumption of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " foisting off " its pollution problems on other states , the court upheld EPA 's decision. 115 The court readily admitted that the statutory language of Section 110(a) ( 2 ) ( E ) posed a dilemma . If the Agency forced an upwind state to reduce its emissions to protect a downwind state , it would potentially " hold one state hostage to another 's failure to enact the pollution control strategies necessary to conform to the requirements of the CAA . " 116 On the other hand , failure to restrict emissions from an upwind state would adversely affect the downwind state and " foreclose " its options for controlling pollution. 117 Despite recognizing the glaring statutory uncertainty in the provision , however , the court concluded that the extent of its review was only to determine whether the EPA action was arbitrary and capricious , an abuse of discretion , or otherwise inconsistent with law. 118 This standard of review coupled with judicial deference to agency determinations doomed further inquiry into the merits of EPA 's interpretation of the statute . Based upon the language of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concurred with EPA 's determination that a small contribution of a pollutant to another state 's nonattainment was probably below the level at which Congress intended EPA to intervene. 119 <p> The effect of the Second Circuit 's decision was to dissuade states from seeking relief under Section 110(a) ( 2 ) ( E ) . 120 So long as the EPA interpretation of the statute was not " plainly unreasonable , " states could not successfully challenge EPA 's rulemaking determinations regarding the contribution necessary to constitute a violation of Section 110(a) ( 2 ) ( E ) . 121 In this case , EPA interpreted the phrase to mean that it should approve the state 's SIP variance for high sulfur fuel unless the change would actually cause a NAAQS violation in another jurisdiction. 122 EPA refined this view in other cases discussed below , but the Agency continued to refuse downwind states redress for the effects of transport on their nonattainment status . <p> Section 126 of the 1977 CAA likewise had significant limitations as drafted by Congress and as applied by EPA. 123 The Section ostensibly provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jurisdictions. 124 The Section did arm states with two important rights : ( i ) mandatory disclosures regarding emissions from certain types of new and existing sources in neighboring states ; and ( ii ) a means to petition EPA to investigate and rectify a particular transport problem . The mandatory disclosure of information was a significant boon , given the burdens involved in discovery of this information by other means . More importantly , however , Section 126 disclosures allowed advance notice of emissions from new or modified sources , and thus a meaningful opportunity to oppose such sources prior to their construction and before political and economic momentum might preclude successful opposition . The enforcement mechanism of Section 126 allowed states to petition EPA to prohibit new or modified sources or to prohibit continued operation of existing sources after three months unless the sources agreed to reduce their emissions to eliminate the interstate effect. 125 The Section also granted states the ability to challenge emissions from upwind states promptly rather than at the next scheduled SIP revision of the upwind state. 126 <p> The utility of Section 126 of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any criteria pollutant , and especially ozone , was extremely circumscribed . The Section applied only to " major stationary sources of emissions . " 127 By definition , this excluded most individual pollutant sources except power or manufacturing plants . Section 126 theoretically permitted actions based upon ozone transport , 128 but because most ozone does not derive from major source emissions , such an action could arise only in unusual circumstances. 129 The majority of ozone derives from a variety of sources that Section 126 does not encompass. 130 <p> Compounding the legal hurdles raised by Section 126 , any attempts to regulate individual emitters of ozone are scientifically problematic as well. 131 The limitations on computer modeling make the identification of a single source of ozone , or even a group of comparable sources , difficult to prove with certainty. 132 As a result , the practical modeling and scientific limitations make Section 126 useful only in a small subset of transport scenarios such as where a large stationary source is immediately adjacent to a border . <p> Perhaps the most crucial limitation of Section 126 was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significantly contribute " to nonattainment in a given area . The 1977 CAA included no explicit guidance regarding what level of contribution to nonattainment would be significant. 133 The precise meaning of the term " significantly contribute " has therefore proven controversial and has stalled attempts by states to use Section 126 against transboundary pollution. 134 The language of the provision is susceptible to a spectrum of interpretations. 135 <p> EPA has interpreted the term so restrictively that , to date , no state has been able to utilize Section 126 successfully to obtain redress. 136 EPA administratively thwarted attempts by states to use Section 126 to reduce transported pollutants in the 1980s , and states sought redress in the courts . In Air Pollution Control District of Jefferson County , Kentucky v. EPA , the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reviewed EPA 's denial of a petition by an area in Kentucky based upon sulfur dioxide transport from Indiana. 137 EPA 's modeling indicated that the Indiana source only contributed up to three percent of the sulfur dioxide in the Kentucky nonattainment area. 138 In its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comments upon whether this amount of contribution constituted a " substantial contribution " to nonattainment. 139 The Agency rejected strict interpretation of the standard as a " but for " test that required the petitioner to show that the upwind state was the sole reason for nonattainment in the downwind area. 140 EPA declined , however , to answer the ultimate question concerning what precise quantity would suffice . Because the percentage of contribution was relatively small , the Agency merely decided that a three percent contribution was not " sufficiently significant ... under any reasonable interpretation of the statutory language . " 141 The lesson of the case was that contribution of only up to three percent of the pollutant in a nonattainment area is not significant for purposes of Section 126. 142 <p> In New York v. EPA , three states challenged EPA 's denial of their Section 126(b) petitions. 143 The states alleged that their sulfur dioxide nonattainment was a direct result of transport from a number of upwind states . In its consideration of the petitions , EPA assessed whether out-of-state sources made a significant contribution to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merits only on the petition by Pennsylvania and concluded that " more than 80% of the sulfur dioxide contributing " to nonattainment came " from Pennsylvania sources , and that therefore the out-of-state sources did not ' significantly contribute ' to the violation. " 145 By implication , approximately twenty percent of the pollutant did emanate from other states . Again , EPA reached its determination and denied the petition based upon the relative proportions of the pollutant sources produced in-state and out-of-state . This was equitable as the downwind states sought to impose emissions controls on upwind states before they had addressed theft own emissions adequately ? The lesson of the case , however , was that even twenty percent of pollutants from transport may not constitute significant contribution for purposes of Section 126 . <p> These cases demonstrate that EPA assesses the level of contribution that is significant on a case-by-case basis and , therefore , what is significant in one situation might not be significant in another . Nevertheless , EPA 's determinations suggest that as little as three percent or as much as twenty percent contribution to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant contribution . By setting the standard high , EPA effectively has eliminated the use of Section 126 to halt interstate transport unless a state had a very high level of a pollutant from another jurisdiction . <p> As a further limitation , EPA interpreted Section 126 narrowly to require only an investigation of the interstate emissions from one or more major sources targeted in the petition rather than a general review of the upwind state 's SIP for violation of Section 110(a) ( 2 ) ( E ) . 147 In the New York decision , the state argued that a Section 126 petition obligated EPA to conduct a broader review of the SIPs of various upwind states to insure that they complied with Section 110(a) ( 2 ) ( E ) . 148 EPA resisted this reading of the statute , and the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit agreed that neither the statutory language nor the structure and legislative history of the 1977 CAA supported the state 's position. 149 The result of this interpretation is that states can not use Section 126 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Viewed in toto , the 1977 CAA did not provide effective solutions to prevent pollutant transport. 150 Presumably EPA was able to use Section 110(a) ( 2 ) ( E ) to convince states to limit transport in the administrative diplomacy that occurs in the SIP approval process . The relatively small number of reported judicial challenges to EPA SIP reviews for failure to prevent transport perhaps supports this hypothesis . Nevertheless , in the way that mattered most , i.e. , the reduction of transported pollutants , the 1977 CAA was not effective. 151 C. The 1990 Clean Air Act <p> The 1990 CAA included many major amendments to address air pollution problems ranging from a new market-based approach to acid rain control in Title IV to a new permit program in Title V.152 The 1990 CAA also contained numerous new provisions intended by Congress specifically to rectify widespread ozone nonattainment. 153 Congress expressed concern that most urban areas throughout the country violated the ozone NAAQS154 and recognized the pivotal role ozone transport played in many nonattainment areas. 155 To reduce ozone nonattainment , new 1990 CAA provisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonattainment by degree of pollution and imposition of graduated control programs ; 156 ( ii ) introduction of emissions reduction milestones ; 157 ( iii ) creation of NOx emissions controls ; 158 ( iv ) introduction of new federal control measures ; 159 and ( v ) creation of an interstate ozone transport region. 160 <p> Among the most marked changes of the 1990 CAA were those that directly addressed ozone transport . For the first time , the 1990 CAA established a regional approach to ozone transport to counteract the chronic nonattainment that stretches from Virginia to Maine. 161 In Section 184(a) , the statute created the Northeast OTR , encompassing the states of the Northeast and a Northeast Ozone Transport Commission ( Northeast OTC ) with representatives of the Northeast OTR jurisdictions , to make regional determinations regarding ozone transport. 162 Creation of the transport region finally acknowledged that transport of ozone precursors across a geographic region makes states and their emission control programs interdependent. 163 <p> Next , Section 184(b) of the 1990 CAA stipulated control measures necessary to reduce rampant ozone precursor emissions and directed states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mandatory measures required reduction of VOCs and NOx emissions to alleviate ozone within the entire ozone transport region. 165 Section 184(b) requires states to impose certain control measures universally throughout their borders including areas without local ozone NAAQS violations. 166 Section 184(b) thus departs from the standard requirements of the CAA by imposing control measures on attainment areas for the benefit of nonattainment areas regardless of whether the former actually contribute pollutants to the latter . <p> To further reduce ozone precursor emissions , the 1990 CAA invested the Northeast OTC with the power to petition EPA to impose additional region-wide control measures requested by the Northeast OTC after a majority vote of its members. 167 Under Section 184(c) , EPA must assess the recommendation to determine if the requested control measure is " necessary " 168 to reach attainment of the ozone NAAQS in any area of the Northeast OTR. 169 To encourage EPA to act upon these recommendations , Section 184(c) obligates EPA to make its determination within a set period of time and places the burden upon EPA to establish that a recommended control measure is not necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OTC recommendation. 170 Congress 's presumed intent in creating the Northeast OTC to make regional determinations on air pollution policy was to encourage states to devise their own solutions , yet to avoid the pitfalls of the " conference " approach to interstate dispute resolution. 171 The 1990 CAA diverged markedly from those historical antecedents by giving EPA the affirmative duty to assess the communal decisions of the Northeast OTC and to impose new control measures if appropriate. 172 Congress also sought to encourage regional solutions to ozone transport by providing for the creation of additional pollutant transport regions . Section 176A permits EPA , either at its own instigation or at the request of any state , to create a transport region. 173 The basis for creation of a new region is an EPA finding that interstate transport of any pollutant " contributes significantly " to a NAAQS violation in another state. 174 Similarly , EPA may add a state or area to an existing transport region upon a finding of significant contribution to transport , or may remove a state or area from an existing transport region upon a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significantly contribute to regional attainment. 175 Enactment of Section 176A reflected widespread belief that regional solutions are the best method to alleviate nonattainment caused by transport. 176 <p> The 1990 CAA also amended former Section 110(a) ( 2 ) ( E ) in significant ways. 177 Most importantly , the amendment drastically expanded the coverage of the provision by supplementing the reference to emissions from " sources " with emissions from " other types of emissions activity . " 178 This modification allows EPA to consider emissions from any source or group of sources within the state when assessing the extraterritorial impacts of transport. 179 This single change means , for example , that EPA can disapprove a SIP on the basis of transport from a large number of mobile sources in a given state or area , thereby empowering EPA to address the predominant source of ozone transport in most jurisdictions. 180 <p> Second , Section 110(a) ( 2 ) ( D ) ( i ) ( I ) now expressly permits EPA to consider emissions that " contribute significantly " to nonattainment in another area or state. 181 The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guidance regarding the precise amount of cross-boundary emission necessary to violate the standard. 182 Based upon the change of language , however , it appears that the Section is more restrictive than the former prohibition against transport of a " pollutant in amounts which will prevent attainment or maintenance " as provided in the 1977 CAA. 183 Formerly , EPA arguably could not halt emissions of a pollutant in one state unless it was the sole cause of nonattainment in another. 184 Alternatively , literal application of the 1977 CAA provision suggested that EPA should restrict any emission from an upwind state if it interfered with attainment. 185 Section 110(a) ( 2 ) ( D ) ( i ) ( I ) now expressly indicates that EPA may halt emissions that are simply a contributing factor in another state 's nonattainment. 186 In this respect , the changes in Section 110(a) ( 2 ) ( D ) follow the evolution of the standard EPA developed administratively in the Section 126 cases. 187 Congress apparently chose to codify the approach taken by the Agency . <p> Finally , Section 110(a) ( 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 1990 CAA provides a separate standard of scrutiny of SIPS for transport impacts upon maintenance areas and thus bifurcated the analysis for compliance. 188 Maintenance areas are those areas that EPA formerly classified as nonattainment but that have subsequently complied with the NAAQS. 189 In the 1977 CAA , the Section instructed the EPA to insure that states included SIP prohibitions against emissions that would " prevent " maintenance of the NAAQS. 190 This standard suggested a higher level of proof in which an aggrieved state had to show that the emissions from the upwind state were the only impediment to continued attainment . The 1990 CAA provides instead that EPA must prohibit emissions that would merely " interfere " with maintenance of the NAAQS. 191 This clarification suggests that Congress intended EPA to restrict upwind state emissions more stringently than before . Such a policy is logical because it rewards states that have enacted the control measures necessary to attain the NAAQS and discourages transport into areas perhaps already predisposed to nonattainment . <p> The 1990 CAA did not greatly amend Section 126 concerning a state 's right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states. 192 The most notable alteration changed the Section to provide expressly that a state may maintain an action because of emissions from a group of major sources rather than having to develop proof that a single major source emitted the offending transported pollutant . This change ratified the interpretation already followed by EPA that recognized the impracticality of proving that a single source emitted the pollutant and also the reality that a large number of major sources can together produce a significant contribution to the nonattainment of another state , even if they would not individually. 193 The lack of other changes suggests congressional satisfaction with the status quo in spite of the inability of any state to maintain a successful action under Section 126 to date. 194 <p> The changes Congress enacted in the 1990 CAA indicate that it was aware of the significant problem posed by ozone transport. 195 Viewed in terms of the three fundamental problems of transport policy apparent after the 1970 CAA , Congress has continued to move toward stronger measures to counter transboundary pollution . Congress strengthened EPA 's position by broadening the SIP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sources. 196 Ostensibly , this will increase the Agency 's power to resolve the allocation of air resources between states . Congress also attempted to clarify the relationship between upwind and downwind jurisdictions under the CAA by providing a more explicit standard for prevention of cross-boundary pollution. 197 The standard is still imprecise , but Congress has signaled that the level of transport the EPA must prohibit is somewhere between the extremes for which the parties have argued , i.e. , EPA must prevent transport that is a " significant contribution " to nonattainment . In addition , Congress sought to encourage states to cooperate on a regional basis rather than as fifty competing free agents . In the case of the Northeast OTR , Congress imposed a regional approach on the affected states. 198 For other states , Congress has created a new mechanism for interstate cooperation to combat pollutant transport that is less complicated and perhaps more effective than its predecessors. 199 Six years after its enactment , however , the 1990 CAA has not provided all the necessary solutions to ozone transport and has engendered new controversies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history of the CAA reflects that Congress has taken an interstitial approach to combat ozone transport. 200 Given this approach , Congress could not anticipate all of the complications that might arise in the implementation of the statute. 201 Since the enactment of the 1990 CAA , EPA and states have encountered daunting problems in the application of the statute 's provisions to the realities of ozone transport . Many problems arise from the ramifications of the statute for downwind jurisdictions . <p> The disadvantages for downwind states begin at the definitional level and extend throughout the statutory provisions of the 1990 CAA . First , the definition of " nonattainment " may apply to an area regardless of the source of the ozone or other pollutant that violates the applicable NAAQS. 202 The degree of an area 's nonattainment depends solely upon the measured quality of the ambient air at a limited number of monitors. 203 Although the statutory definition of nonattainment explicitly acknowledges that one area can cause the nonattainment of another , the provision makes no exceptions for an area so affected . EPA must thus classify an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no sources of ozone or ozone precursors within its geographical boundaries or under its legal control through the SIP process . In short , the CAA definition can designate an area nonattainment simply because it is the recipient of another area 's polluted air. 204 <p> Once designated nonattainment , the area must comply with the full panoply of requirements and restrictions that attend this status . For example , the CAA obligates a moderate nonattainment area to implement the control measures enumerated in Section 182(b) even if the area does not encompass the actual sources of the pollutant in its ambient air. 205 Section 182 imposes a regime of control measures that escalates by steps depending upon the severity of the area 's nonattainment from marginal to extreme. 206 With each escalation in the severity of nonattainment , the CAA imposes additional mandatory control measures that involve increasing cost and complexity . In theory , adoption of the extra control measures will cause the area to reach attainment by the specified attainment date. 207 <p> If the actual sources of the pollutant lie outside the boundaries of the area , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area 's nonattainment. 208 Assuming that the area has some emissions of ozone precursors , certain controls may initially have limited positive effects . As the control measures limit or eliminate the indigenous sources of ozone precursors , additional control measures will be increasingly ineffective to improve ambient air quality. 209 Notwithstanding this result , Section 181(b) ( 2 ) mandates an increase in the severity level of the area 's designated nonattainment classification if the area misses an attainment deadline. 210 There could , therefore , be scenarios in which a state no longer has any ozone precursor emissions yet the level of transported ozone obligates that state to enact an ever more restrictive set of controls to meet unreachable ambient air goals. 211 Eventually , a state will be unable to implement controls that will achieve the necessary reductions to reach the attainment target. 212 <p> When a state can no longer submit a SIP that will demonstrate compliance with the ozone NAAQS , it will run afoul of the requirements for timely and complete SIP submissions in Section 110 . Moreover , Section 110(k) ( 5 ) directs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time it finds a state 's SIP inadequate to reach attainment and to give the state a reasonable period , not to exceed eighteen months , to rectify the shortcoming. 213 Failure to demonstrate timely attainment or other infractions regarding SIP submissions are grounds for EPA to sanction a state. 214 Under Section 179 , 215 EPA may sanction a noncomplying state within its discretion at any time following a finding of noncompliance and must sanction a noncomplying state eighteen months following such a finding. 216 Even if EPA exercises its discretion not to impose early penalties because of inequitable transport-related circumstances , Section 179 explicitly directs EPA to sanction a state eighteen months after a finding that its SIP is insufficient to bring an area into attainment unless the state has corrected the deficiency. 217 In either scenario , the sanctions mete out harsh punishment for a jurisdiction unable to attain because of pollutants transported from outside that area. 218 <p> Ultimately , if the state is unable to implement emissions controls sufficient to reach attainment , Section 110(c) contemplates that EPA shall take over this responsibility and develop a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process strips a state 's authority to make its own technical , economic , and political decisions regarding pollution control within its own bailiwick . In the worst case scenario , where there are no ozone precursor sources within the state , EPA can presumably do little through a FIP either to remedy the problem or to affect the state adversely. 220 In a more realistic scenario , however , in which a state has some sources of ozone such as its citizens ' automobiles , the CAA will require EPA to devise controls to reduce ozone that the drivers or industry of the state might consider draconian. 221 Inhabitants of the state must then endure not only the control measures necessary to reach attainment for their own emissions , but also extra measures to make up for ozone that wafts in from upwind states. 222 <p> Further complications arise because of the conformity rule set forth in Section 176(c). 223 That Section prohibits the federal government from having any involvement in projects that fall to conform with a state 's SIP . The statute defines " conformity " broadly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consistent with the SIP 's purpose of reducing the number and severity of NAAQS violations and achievement of " expeditious attainment ; " and ( ii ) can not cause new violations , exacerbate existing violations , or delay compliance with any required reductions or the ultimate attainment deadline. 224 One primary purpose of the conformity rule is to " protect the integrity of the implementation plan by ensuring that its growth projections are not exceeded without additional measures to counterbalance the excess growth . " 225 <p> Application of the conformity rule to a nonattainment area requires the federal government to scrutinize all projects closely to prevent further adverse environmental effects. 226 In an ozone nonattainment area , this may reduce the number and scope of federal projects . Transportation projects in particular will suffer drastic curtailment unless they meet stringent standards for conformity . The policy goals behind the conformity rule are laudable , but the effects upon areas subject to ozone transport may be inequitable and counterproductive . <p> For example , a prohibition against a given federal project in a downwind area with serious ozone nonattainment but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area 's development and economic climate . Ironically , if the upwind area meets the NAAQS within its own borders and EPA has not made a finding that it significantly contributes to the woes of the downwind area , the upwind area may more easily comply with the conformity rule and thereby benefit by continued federal projects that may increase transport to the downwind state. 227 <p> The anomalies of the nonattainment and ozone transport provisions also impact upwind jurisdictions under the express terms of the CAA . The definition of attainment contemplates that if an area contributes to nonattainment elsewhere it may thereby be in nonattainment. 228 This definition does not track the language of Section 110(a) ( 2 ) ( D ) ( i ) ( I ) which refers more restrictively to " significant " contribution to another jurisdiction . Section 110(k) ( 5 ) also obligates EPA to issue a SIP call whenever a state 's SIP is " substantially inadequate " to mitigate the effects of transport. 229 Section 110(a) ( 2 ) ( D ) ( i ) ( I ) provides that EPA must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or other type of emissions activity ... which will contribute significantly to nonattainment in , or interference with maintenance by , any other State .... " 230 <p> A literal application of these provisions might require EPA to halt much of the otherwise lawful emissions activity in an upwind state . For example , air crossing the border from state A to state B will have some level of ozone even if state A is unquestionably in attainment for ozone . It is unclear whether EPA must restrict emissions in state A so that the air at the border contains not more than 0.12 ppm of ozone , no ozone whatsoever , or any amount in between those extremes. 231 This conundrum has " plagued " EPA for decades. 232 <p> If EPA forces a state to reduce its emissions solely to prevent transport , rather than because of any in-state nonattainment , EPA will effectively have deprived that state of the increment of emissions ostensibly permitted by the NAAQS . Similarly , if EPA forces a state to accelerate control measures purely for the benefit of downwind states , EPA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ select and time implementation of control measures . A stringent enforcement of Section 110(a) ( 2 ) ( D ) ( i ) ( I ) might therefore hold the citizens or industry of an upwind state " hostage " to a downwind state. 233 A failure to comply with an EPA-mandated reduction would subject the upwind state to the same gauntlet of escalating statutory controls , FIPs , and potential sanctions . <p> As a practical matter , many states will be simultaneously both upwind and downwind relative to other states . The CAA attempts to limit EPA 's scrutiny of transport to emissions activity within the state itself rather than that from farther upwind. 234 Given the complex variables at work in the creation of ozone , however , it may be difficult for many states to establish that the particular ozone causing downwind nonattainment came from farther upwind rather than from their own in-state emissions . Thus , if Massachusetts wants to receive relief from upwind sources of ozone in New York , it must also be willing to extend the same courtesy to downwind receivers of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Northeast OTR endure additional problems with the regime of transport provisions in the CAA . One reason for discontent is the blanket application of control measures throughout a state without regard to the geographical scope of the nonattainment areas within that state. 235 The result is that large areas of a state may face additional controls and standards that are arguably unnecessary . Critics complain that this renders an entire state unattractive to economic development because of the stringency of the control measures ? Inclusion in the Northeast OTR thereby compounds the perceived unfairness of the CAA . If any Northeast OTR state or portion thereof is in nonattainment because of transport , the entire transport region may potentially have to enact additional control measures and suffer the economic and other consequences. 237 If the sources of the transported ozone are located outside the borders of the Northeast OTR in Ohio or Virginia , the entire Northeast OTR may suffer because of the failure of these upwind jurisdictions to curtail emissions. 238 This has emboldened states to oppose membership in the Northeast OTR. 239 <p> Congress knew the potential unfairness raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with no ability to control the sources of the pollutant. 240 In response , Congress created several limited exemptions in the 1990 CAA that provide relief to certain nonattainment areas under extenuating circumstances . These explicit exemptions exist for : ( i ) areas suffering from international transport ; ( ii ) rural areas without large amounts of emissions ; and ( lii ) areas obligated to impose fines on sources . Congress created an analogous limited exemption for an area within an ozone transport region to opt out of the region under specified circumstances. 241 <p> The exemption for areas with ozone transport from foreign sources appears in Section 179(B). 242 Although the definition of nonattainment makes no exception for a state suffering from ozone transport from an adjoining state , the statute does grant an area special dispensation if the source of the pollution is in another country . Congress carved out this exception specifically to aid El Paso , Texas , because it suffers from serious ozone transport across the Rio Grande from Mexico. 243 Congress recognized that Texas had little or no ability to control pollution wafting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Connecticut River provides a frontier as open to ozone as the Rio Grande and thus Vermont and New Hampshire arguably stand in the same relation as Mexico and Texas . The rationale for the distinction is that , unlike the individual states of the United States , Mexico is not governed by the CAA and thus Texas can not influence or obtain redress for the pollution. 244 There is no comparable blanket exemption for downwind states for domestic transport , presumably because the emissions of an upwind state are under the control of EPA via Section 110(a) ( 2 ) ( D ) . Congress evidently recognized the unfairness to downwind areas subject to transport , but chose to provide leniency only to those that received transport from another nation rather than another state . <p> Congress created another exemption from arguably inequitable effects of the CAA for " rural transport areas . " 245 Section 182(h) provides that if EPA determines that a nonattainment area is not within or adjacent to a metropolitan statistical area ( and is hence " rural " ) and does not " significantly contribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designate the area a " marginal " nonattainment area regardless of the true level of nonattainment. 246 The creation of this exemption suggests an intent to avoid infliction of harsh legal ramifications for areas with few sources of ozone precursors and little transport impact upon other areas . The provision does not completely exempt the area from the regime of control measures because the area must still comply with the requirements for a marginal nonattainment area . This indicates an attempt to balance the desire to avoid potential unfairness of the transport provisions with a desire to protect the air quality of the inhabitants . <p> Congress created a comparable exemption from economic hardships in situations where the CAA obligates states to impose financial penalties upon sources in nonattainment areas . Section 185 provides that states with severe and extreme nonattainment areas must impose fines on all major sources in areas that fail to attain by the required date. 247 The state must continue the fines until the area attains the ozone NAAQS. 248 Given the potential cost of lingering nonattainment , it would be unfair to impose the fines if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a limited exemption for areas that would attain but for transport . By definition , the exemption is available only to areas that have a population of under 200,000 and are thus relatively rural. 249 The exemption is also applicable only if : ( i ) the area can demonstrate that it is unable to reach attainment " because of ozone or ozone precursors from other areas ; " and ( ii ) the area has " met all requirements and implemented all measures " applicable under the CAA. 250 Again , the exemption suggests a desire to mitigate perceived unfairness , but also to protect the health of the inhabitants . If the population exceeds 200,000 , Congress evidently concluded that sources should pay fines regardless of the effects of transport on the area . <p> Further evidence of congressional cognizance of potential unfairness in the statutory regime appears in Section 176A. 251 The Section governs the creation of regional commissions to abate interstate transport of pollution from one or more states when it " contributes significantly to a violation of a national ambient air quality standard " in another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for states or portions of states if they can not make a significant contribution to the solution of a transport problem. 253 States or portions thereof can secede from a regional transport commission under certain circumstances. 254 Thus , an area within a transport region can receive a de facto exemption from an otherwise required control measure . No such mechanism exists for states or areas to opt out of the statutory nonattainment designation under comparable circumstances . By implication , Congress was willing to allow an area to avoid control measures imposed by an interstate transport commission if the measures would not hasten attainment for the region as a whole . Congress was evidently unwilling to allow the same leniency for an area classified as nonattainment simply as a result of ozone transport. 255 <p> The existence and extent of the exemptions suggest that Congress sought to soften the effects of nonattainment on areas subject to ozone transport . Of course , the exemptions and their scope result from the legislative process and presumably reflect political compromises . The mere existence of the exemptions is , however , problematic in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress directed EPA not to treat certain areas according to the provisions otherwise applicable to nonattainment areas. 256 By negative implication , Congress did intend EPA to apply the statute strictly to all other downwind areas without regard to the source of the ozone causing nonattainment . Subtract the international transport areas and qualifying rural transport areas from the list of nonattainment areas , and the remaining areas are those that are predominantly urban or adjacent to urban areas like those of the Northeast OTR . The absence of exemptions for these types of areas suggests that Congress intended EPA to apply the statute literally to many transport areas regardless of perceived inequities . <p> Implementation problems of the 1990 CAA pose a threat to the effectiveness of the statute as a whole . The CAA imposes numerous obligations upon states to rectify ozone nonattainment . Many of these obligations are politically unpopular and have prompted state governments to oppose control measures Congress explicitly mandated in the CAA. 257 The severity of ozone nonattainment throughout the Northeast OTR and the imminent attainment deadlines have stimulated those states to consider ever more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that requires automobile manufacturers to sell vehicles with California emission standards throughout the northeastern states. 258 Dislike of the OTC LEV program has engendered growing dissatisfaction with the regional approach to reducing ozone transport and has emboldened some states to sue EPA259 or to threaten to secede from the Northeast OTR. 260 The glaring illogic of forcing downwind areas to take drastic steps to counteract pollutants from upwind jurisdictions invites states to adopt a mode of resignation or defiance that may result in further delays in improving the nation 's air quality. 261 IV . EPA EFFORTS TO MODERATE HARSH EFFECTS OF THE 1990 CAA OZONE TRANSPORT PROVISIONS <p> The perceived systemic unfairness of the CAA to downwind states has tested the stoicism of northeasterners and brought forth resentment reminiscent of the type that spurred their forebears to unload tea into Boston 's harbor. 262 For example , most states in the Northeast OTR have either refused to enact or have repealed state laws to implement CAA-mandated centralized automobile inspection and maintenance facilities. 263 Unhappiness with various mandatory programs of the 1990 CAA has arisen across the country. 264 Northeast OTR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from upwind states or face new litigation based on Sections 110 and 126. 265 EPA has attempted to work within the constraints of the 1990 CAA to develop flexible policies266 to avoid the harsh effects of the statute on areas suffering from transport , but simultaneously to encourage continued progress toward alleviation of the underlying ozone transport problem. 267 Examination of EPA 's efforts illustrates continuing difficulties with the provisions of the CAA concerning ozone transport . A. Clarification of " Significant Contribution " <p> One means of providing relief to areas subject to transport lies in EPA 's own interpretation of the term " significant contribution . " Section 110(a) ( 2 ) ( D ) ( i ) ( I ) explicitly instructs EPA to reject SIPs unless they contain provisions to prohibit in-state emissions that " contribute significantly " to air quality violations in other jurisdictions. 268 Like its predecessors , the 1990 CAA included no express definition of the term , and thus the meaning of the provision is unclear. 269 EPA has attempted to define the contours of Section 110(a) ( 2 ) ( D ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to interpret the term " significant contribution " more stringently and to apply it to restrict ozone transport . Two recent EPA pronouncements illustrate the Agency 's interpretation of " significant contribution " and demonstrate how the Agency may apply the statute in future SIP reviews : ( i ) the final approval of the OTC LEV program for the Northeast OTR ; 270 and ( ii ) the guidance memorandum detailing the conditions for a state or area to opt out of an ozone transport region. 271 Both Agency actions entailed an implicit analysis of whether one area significantly contributes to another and reflect the current Agency understanding of that term in Section 110(a) ( 2 ) ( D ) ( i ) ( I ) . Together , the actions suggest that EPA intends to read the statute broadly to protect downwind states from ozone transport . <p> One articulation of EPA 's interpretation appeared in the Agency 's approval of the OTC LEV program recommendation by the Northeast OTC . Under Section 184(c) , 272 EPA had to assess whether OTC LEV was a " necessary " control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintain the ozone NAAQS. 273 Section 184(c) ( 5 ) 274 incorporates by reference both Section 110(a) ( 2 ) ( D ) 275 and Section 110(k) ( 5 ) 276 to indicate that EPA must issue a SIP call for failure to contain a new required regional control measure. 277 Based upon these internal references , EPA reasoned that the necessity analysis of Section 184(c) and the " significant contribution " analysis of Section 110(a) ( 2 ) ( D ) are linked. 278 One test of a control measure 's necessity is whether it is essential to eliminate a significant contribution of emissions to other states. 279 If the measure is " necessary , " absence of the measure equates to a failure to prohibit " significant contribution " to nonattainment or interference with maintenance. 280 At first blush , the logic appears circular , but the provisions of the 1990 CAA compel this conclusion in the transport context . If EPA determines that a control measure is " necessary " to reduce pollutants in downwind states , the lack of that control measure by definition contributes significantly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EPA 's proposed final rule imposing OTC LEV because of EPA 's failure to specify more fully the level of transported emissions that would be " significant . " 282 The commenters contended that EPA could not impose a control measure unless it could prove that failure to have the measure would contribute a particular percentage of the pollutant in another state and that this percentage exceeded a specific numerical threshold EPA had previously determined to be significant. 283 The commenters cited Section 126 cases as proof of EPA 's past reliance on numerical thresholds for " significant contribution " and went so far as to claim that EPA 's prior Section 126 determinations created a presumption regarding what level is " significant . " 284 <p> EPA rejected the challenge on a number of grounds . First , the express language of Section 184 , Section 110(a) ( 2 ) ( D ) , and Section 110(k) ( 5 ) do not explicitly obligate EPA to set a specific quantitative standard. 285 To the contrary , the provisions only contemplate that EPA will determine the level in relative terms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EPA reasoned that the determination of whether a control measure is " necessary " and would prevent " significant contribution " or " interference " thus requires a case-by-case analysis . With respect to OTC LEV , EPA concluded that Northeast OTR states could not obtain the requisite fifty to seventy-five percent reductions of VOCs and NOx needed to reach attainment without the proposed control measure , regardless of the precise percentage reduction it would provide. 286 <p> EPA also dismissed the notion that prior findings in Section 126 cases created a presumption regarding what percentage of contribution constitutes " significant contribution " to transport. 287 EPA distinguished the Section 126 cases on the obvious grounds that they dealt with other pollutants , other types of sources , and other types of modeling problems . Given that the determination of contribution requires case-by-case analysis , such prior findings were not dispositive of the issue . EPA also went farther , however , and stated that the assessment of Section 126 differs fundamentally from that of Section 184. 288 Section 126 allows EPA to determine whether a given percentage of contribution to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By this approach , for example , if three percent of a state 's ozone results from transport , it is arguably not significant relative to the ninety-seven percent from in-state sources. 289 Under Section 184 , EPA argued that it must determine whether a proposed control measure is " necessary " to achieve the total reductions needed to reach attainment . Viewed in this light , even a one percent reduction in emissions might be necessary and , thus , significant in the absence of other available control measures. 290 <p> EPA 's explanation stopped short of providing an express definition of " significant contribution " of general applicability in the transport context . The Agency noted , however , that the necessity test at least delineates one type of " significant contribution " under Section 110(a) ( 2 ) ( D ) . 291 EPA 's final rule on OTC LEV indicates that one means of determining what is " significant contribution " is to assess whether a given reduction of contribution will aid attainment or maintenance . This approach is diametrically opposed to the former EPA analysis under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pollution from in-state sources and out-of-state sources to weigh the significance of the transported pollutant. 292 <p> If EPA follows the precedent of OTC LEV in SIP reviews under Section 110(a) ( 2 ) ( D ) , EPA could examine the availability of practicable emission reductions and assess whether elimination of transport would make attainment or maintenance more likely instead of requiring that the transport be the predominant cause of pollution. 293 This could lower the percentage of a pollutant necessary to establish significant contribution and remove the emphasis from the relative percentage of ozone produced by in-state versus out-of-state sources . By altering its administrative interpretation of the term " significant contribution , " EPA could use Section 110(a) ( 2 ) ( D ) and even Section 126 more effectively to stop ozone transport . <p> EPA has also signaled the possibility of a more protective administrative interpretation of " significant contribution " in another context involving ozone and the Northeast OTR . EPA issued a guidance memorandum that detailed the conditions under which a state may opt out of the Northeast OTR and thereby avoid its required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behest of Maine , but indicated that other members of the Northeast OTR have expressed similar interest. 295 The statutory authority for opting out of a transport region appears in Section 176A. 296 That provision permits EPA to excuse areas or states that do " not significantly contribute to the attainment of the standard in any area in the transport region . " 297 <p> EPA 's policy requires states to submit evidence to support a two-step analysis . The first step entails state submission of modeling to establish whether control of ozone precursors in the proposed opt-out area " contributes to attainment in another State in the OTR. " 298 The memorandum details the precise multi-level , multi-event modeling EPA expects from the state to establish a right to exemption. 299 The required modeling is rigorous and EPA 's scrutiny of the results will evidently be more so. 300 The analysis does not weigh what percentage of pollutant the area contributes to a nonattainment area. 301 Instead , the analysis is whether the area contributes any pollutant to such an area during a violation of the ozone NAAQS . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control measures will prevent any contribution to a NAAQS violation in another area , then exemption from the Northeast OTR is inappropriate. 302 <p> Similarly , in the second step of the analysis the petitioning state must submit evidence to EPA concerning vehicle migration across state or area lines. 303 The state must establish that failure to have otherwise required control measures will not make these commuters exporters of pollution to other jurisdictions. 304 Although the guidance memorandum does not mandate any particular methodology for meeting this second prong of the test , the implication is that if there are commuters crossing state lines , the petitioning state has a higher burden of proof to justify the exemption from the Northeast OTR. 305 <p> EPA 's own succinct summary of the opt-out policy is that states must demonstrate through both steps of the analysis that retention of control measures in the proposed opt-out area " would not contribute to attainment elsewhere in the OTR. " 306 The opt-out policy thus arguably imposes a higher burden of proof than the CAA because it does not track the language of Section 176A which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contribute " to attainment elsewhere. 307 Presumably , EPA will apply the policy consistently with the statutory language and thus EPA intends the policy merely as a starting point for states to establish a prima facie case for exclusion from the Northeast OTR . Read literally , however , the memorandum suggests that the Agency plans to restrict the ability of states or areas to opt out of the Northeast OTR by raising the burden of proof . It will evidently do so , in part , by interpreting a state 's " significant contribution " to attainment as a relatively small contribution to attainment . In effect , the agency has at least created a presumption that any exacerbation of downwind nonattainment will disqualify an area from opting out of the Northeast OTR . In short , any contribution may be " significant contribution " under the proper circumstances . <p> Taken together , EPA 's recent actions may clarify the agency 's current interpretation of " significant contribution " in Section 110(a) ( 2 ) ( D ) ( i ) ( I ) . 308 In each action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach of the Section 126 cases and has thereby created a standard potentially more protective of downwind jurisdictions. 309 Neither action fully illuminates how the Agency will decide every instance of transport contribution , but both reflect an intent to impose a higher standard . This position is consistent with the changes in the 1990 CAA that imposed more stringent standards in the review of SIPs for ozone transport impacts. 310 It is also consistent with the evolution of EPA 's more active intervention to prohibit transport . Unfortunately , the EPA administrative interpretations of Section 110(a) ( 2 ) ( D ) shed little light on how the Agency should resolve the underlying questions of interstate equity to allocate emissions reductions between upwind and downwind jurisdictions . <p> It is relatively easy to find that a small percentage of contribution from an upwind state is significant . It is relatively difficult to force the upwind state to restrict its emissions when that may cripple its economy and enrage its citizens and politicians . While it is preferable to allow EPA to make such determinations on a case-by-case basis rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoidance of the underlying issue will do little to calm either upwind or downwind state concerns . It is likely , however , that the courts will examine this question if EPA applies its recent interpretation of " significant contribution " in SIP reviews and states or environmental groups oppose the agency 's conclusions. 311 <p> Judicial review of EPA 's interpretation of the " significant contribution " language of Section 110(a) ( 2 ) ( D ) will likely result in confirmation of the agency reading . It is not logic that compels this conclusion , but rather the standard of review and deference courts accord agency interpretations generally . Courts review the agency reading of a statute according to the framework the United States Supreme Court enunciated in Chevron USA v. EPA and its progeny. 312 Application of this standard to EPA 's current interpretation of " significant contribution " should uphold the agency 's reading of the statute . The CAA does not define the term explicitly . The statutory scheme and legislative history shed little direct light on the meaning of the phrase . If anything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congressional intent to incorporate the agency interpretation of the term in the earlier Section 126 cases . EPA 's interpretation of the term has historically received judicial deference and will likely continue to do so. 313 <p> EPA 's interpretation of the term " significant contribution " in Section 110(a) ( 2 ) ( D ) ( i ) ( I ) could provide relief to downwind jurisdictions . If the agency adopts a more restrictive definition in SIP reviews than in the past , it will reduce the amount of ozone transport to downwind states . This reduction of the actual level of transport will go far toward permitting the downwind states either to attain or fail to attain based upon their own efforts to reduce emissions . Adoption of control measures commensurate with in-state emissions will make enactment of the control measures less politically charged and more defensible as a necessary sacrifice applicable to all states equitably . As a collateral benefit , a stricter standard will eliminate transport as a disingenuous excuse for states to avoid control measures necessary to reduce in-state emissions . B. Extension of Attainment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempted to aid states subject to substantial ozone transport by adjusting attainment dates administratively under certain limited circumstances . A particularly knotty problem has arisen because of the staggered attainment dates Congress inserted into the 1990 CAA. 314 Section 181 provides for differing attainment dates depending upon the severity of an area 's ozone nonattainment. 315 The statute permits areas with more ozone pollution longer periods to reach attainment. 316 The statute also directs areas within each classification of nonattainment to enact enumerated control measures. 317 In general , states in each category of nonattainment must enact the control measures required for the less polluted tiers of nonattainment areas , plus additional stipulated control measures. 318 This hierarchical regime would appear to treat all areas objectively based upon the relative amount of pollutants within each state and to allow states to enact appropriate control measures within a statutorily allotted time . The staggered attainment dates , however , will wreak havoc upon states subject to ozone transport from other jurisdictions. 319 <p> A hypothetical example illustrates the dilemma . Assume that Area A has a " severe " ozone nonattainment problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2007 to reach attainment . Assume that Area B has a " serious " ozone nonattainment problem . The statute allows Area B until 1999 to comply with the ozone NAAQS . Area A is directly upwind from Area B and contributes to Area B 's nonattainment via ozone transport . Based solely upon the ambient level of ozone , EPA must treat Area B as nonattainment even if Area B has taken all steps required by the CAA. 320 By 1999 , if not before for failure to demonstrate attainment , the CAA will require EPA to sanction Area B.321 <p> In theory , EPA can use Section 110(a) ( 2 ) ( D ) to force Area A to alleviate the transport problem by requiring its SIP to contain provisions to prohibit sources from contributing significantly to nonattainment in Area B.322 Unfortunately , if EPA forces Area A to enact additional control measures and reduce its ozone precursor emissions early for the sake of Area B , EPA will have denied Area A the additional time and other protections Congress explicitly afforded Area A in Section 181. 323 Area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A 's voluntary cooperation . In a region with significant transport over numerous jurisdictions with varying attainment dates as in the Northeast OTR , the enforcement problems multiply geometrically . <p> In response to this anomalous result , EPA has considered selective postponement of attainment deadlines to afford relief to downwind areas that suffer from ozone transport. 324 EPA devised a special policy applicable to areas affected by " overwhelming transport " from upwind areas with more serious nonattainment and hence later attainment dates. 325 The guidance allows a downwind nonattainment area to assume the later attainment date of an upwind area under certain conditions. 326 EPA openly acknowledged that it intended to allow states to " bump up " to a later nonattainment category 's attainment date without having to adopt the mandatory control measures of the higher category. 327 <p> To establish its status as an area with overwhelming transport , the state must demonstrate through EPA-approved modeling that it would attain the NAAQS by its own original attainment date " but for " the overwhelming amount of ozone from an identified upwind area with a later attainment date. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have to adopt more emissions control measures than otherwise required under the statute in order to satisfy this " but for " test. 329 Thereafter , the state must submit a SIP revision that includes : ( i ) adoption of all mandatory control measures for its original nonattainment classification ; ( ii ) rate of progress requirements consistent with its original attainment date ; ( iii ) a demonstration that the area can attain by the new attainment date ; and ( iv ) modeling analysis establishing that the area could not adopt any " practicable " additional control measures to reach attainment sooner. 330 With regard to the latter point , the memorandum indicates that EPA might require a state to enact additional control measures as part of any agreement to extend the attainment date if such measures are practicable. 331 <p> The EPA policy also requires the active participation of the upwind jurisdiction in this process . The upwind area must submit to EPA documentation to establish : ( i ) its adoption of all mandatory control measures for a nonattainment area of its classification ; ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own attainment date ; and ( iii ) modeling analysis of whether the downwind jurisdiction can attain prior to the upwind area 's attainment date. 332 The policy is less clear , however , about whether the upwind area must take steps above and beyond those mandated by Section 181 in order to aid the attainment of a downwind jurisdiction. 333 The memorandum states that an upwind area " is not obliged to accelerate reductions " if the acceleration would be " clearly impracticable . " 334 By negative implication , this suggests that EPA might force upwind jurisdictions to accelerate some control measures for the benefit of downwind areas regardless of the ostensibly immutable attainment deadlines and control measure stipulations of Section 181. 335 <p> EPA 's Overwhelming Transport Memorandum leaves to the SIP process the precise determination of whether either adoption of an additional control measure by a downwind area or acceleration of a control measure by an upwind area is " practicable . " 336 The definition of practicability is , thus , of great import . In the case of downwind jurisdictions seeking an extension , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " analyze the impact of the adoption of the mandatory control measures under the CAA for the next higher level of nonattainment. 337 For upwind states seeking to avoid acceleration of control measures , the memorandum suggests a number of things that are clearly impracticable : ( i ) imposition of federal control measures when it would be impracticable for the state to enact state rules to implement the policy earlier ; ( ii ) imposition of control measures that require long preparation that states could not have begun earlier ; and ( iii ) imposition of any other measure that the state establishes as impracticable because of " excessive economic burdens " or for " technological " reasons. 338 <p> The elasticity of these definitions probably allows EPA maximum maneuvering room to reach negotiated settlements between states . Despite the ambiguity as to what EPA will deem impracticable in each SIP review process , EPA has signaled that it may require more of both downwind and upwind jurisdictions as part of any attainment deadline extension . The converse is also true , however , in that EPA 's policy at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jurisdiction . <p> Anticipating challenges to its policy , EPA preemptively included its legal rationale . First , EPA grounded the policy on its privilege to interpret ambiguous statutory provisions. 339 The staggered attainment dates in Section 181 stipulate the timeframe for attainment and the control measures for each classification of ozone nonattainment area. 340 Section 110(a) ( 2 ) ( D ) ( i ) ( I ) , however , instructs EPA to approve only SIPs that prohibit emissions that contribute significantly to nonattainment in other jurisdictions . This latter Section further obligates EPA to enforce its application " consistent with the provisions of title I , " thereby emphasizing that EPA must observe other statutory limitations on that power such as those in Section 181. 341 EPA considers these provisions to be contradictory because Section 181 appears to guaranty upwind nonattainment areas the statutory time limit to reach attainment and to stipulate the required control measures , whereas Section 110 purports to give EPA power to supersede that gnaranty. 342 In light of this apparent conflict in the statutory language , EPA chose to exercise its authority to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chevron test . EPA concluded that Congress could not have intended EPA to negate the graduated attainment date schedule. 343 <p> Assuming that the attainment date of an upwind area must be inviolate , EPA then reasoned that it would be unjust to punish a downwind jurisdiction for failure to attain if that failure unquestionably resulted from transport from the upwind area. 344 EPA inferred that Congress could not have intended that result from the interplay of Section 181 and Section 110(a) ( 2 ) ( D ) ( i ) ( I ) . EPA 's guidance memorandum does not elaborate upon its analysis and merely states that it would be an " absurd " result. 345 This oblique reference presumably relates to the legal principle of absurd results that prevents an agency from enforcing a statute in an illogical way. 346 The principle has common sense appeal , but courts have been hesitant to use it except when the result of an interpretation is patently absurd in order to avoid the risk of the court finding absurdity where the legislature saw rationality. 347 <p> Faced with a dilemma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dates for the downwind jurisdiction to avoid punishing either upwind or downwind states in situations involving overwhelming ozone transport . Regardless of the Agency 's effort to harmonize arguably conflicting provisions , environmental groups have sued the Agency alleging that the policy flagrantly violates the CAA. 348 The environmental groups contend that the language of the CAA does not provide EPA with authority to extend attainment dates in this fashion based upon the excuse of overwhelming transport. 349 <p> The challenge to EPA 's Overwhelming Transport Memorandum is well founded . Nothing in the CAA explicitly permits EPA to allow downwind jurisdictions to assume the attainment deadline of an upwind jurisdiction . To the contrary , the CAA already contains two explicit provisions allowing extensions that are inconsistent with EPA 's policy . Section 181(a) ( 5 ) permits EPA to issue up to two one-year extensions of an area 's attainment date if the area has fully complied with its approved SIP and there has not been more than one violation of the ozone NAAQS in the preceding year. 350 EPA 's overwhelming transport policy potentially extends the attainment date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to areas that have only limited NAAQS violations . <p> Similarly , EPA 's overwhelming transport policy conflicts with the express provisions of Section 181(b) concerning the reclassification of an area that fails to attain by its statutory deadline . For such an area , the statute requires a reclassification by operation of law to the higher of : ( i ) the next tier of nonattainment ; or ( ii ) the tier reflecting the true degree of nonattainment. 351 The statute also provides for voluntary reclassification at the request of the state to a higher classification. 352 In neither instance , however , does the provision allow the area to receive special dispensation to avoid adherence to the schedule of mandatory control measures for each classification of ozone nonattainment. 353 In this important regard , EPA 's Overwhelming Transport Memorandum diverges from the statutory scheme set forth in the 1990 CAA by potentially extending an attainment date without requiring the stipulated control measures for that level of nonattainment . Whatever the fairness arguments in favor of EPA 's overwhelming transport policy , it violates a cardinal rule of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a statute so as to give effect to all of its provisions. 354 <p> EPA 's Overwhelming Transport Memorandum could provide relief to downwind jurisdictions if it survives judicial challenge . By allowing states to benefit by the later attainment dates of more seriously polluted upwind states , the downwind states will have a more realistic chance to attain and can avoid more drastic control measures only necessary because of ozone transport into their jurisdictions. 355 The policy would thus allow EPA flexibility to ameliorate perceived inequities under the CAA administratively in the appropriate circumstances rather than allowing a wholesale extension to all states , including those that may have failed to attain in bad faith . C. Adoption of an Eighty Percent Rule for SIP Submittal Acceptance <p> EPA has also striven to aid states subject to transport by administratively softening some of the requirements and deadlines of the 1990 CAA . One key requirement of the CAA is for the submission of SIP revisions with attainment demonstrations , i.e. , proof that the control measures in place will reduce emissions and allow the state to attain the ozone NAAQS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include : ( i ) an attainment demonstration with modeling to show attainment by the applicable deadline ; ( ii ) a rate of progress plan to reflect a three percent reduction in ozone precursors for each three-year period until the attainment date ; and ( iii ) evidence that the state has already enacted statutes to implement the control measures necessary to implement ( i ) and ( ii ) . The deadline for the submission of attainment SIPs was November , 1994 , for serious , severe , and extreme ozone nonattainment areas. 356 Many jurisdictions had difficulty in meeting the deadline. 357 <p> Theoretically , all states should have been able to submit a SIP to demonstrate appropriate ozone precursor reductions by the statutory deadline . Unfortunately , because of difficulties in data collection for the preliminary emissions inventory and calculation of the emissions baseline , most states were unable to comply in a timely fashion. 358 Ozone transport exacerbated the modeling and data collection problems for states attempting to devise attainment demonstrations . The time and resources necessary to obtain pollutant modeling on a larger geographic scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moreover , states were uncertain how EPA would treat upwind and downwind jurisdictions and whether EPA would require additional control measures of either jurisdiction in accordance with Section 110(a) ( 2 ) ( D ) , or merely enforce the schedule of control measures in Section 181. 360 <p> The statutory deadlines of the 1990 CAA are specific and intentionally aggressive to encourage technological development. 361 The deadlines are firm unless the statute explicitly provides authority for EPA to modify them. 362 Not only must states actually meet the NAAQS for ozone by the ultimate attainment dates in Section 181 , but they must also comply with a regime of interim SIP submissions and " milestone " reductions of ozone precursors at specific intervals prior to the final attainment date. 363 The inability of states to comply with the deadline for attainment SIPs tested the resolve of EPA to enforce the deadlines of the CAA rigorously . <p> Faced with the prospect of mass noncompliance , EPA issued a guidance memorandum providing an interim policy for conditional acceptance of SIPs notwithstanding the problem of incomplete data or uncertain EPA policy regarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " completeness " criteria EPA normally uses to assess whether a state has fully complied with the minimum content requirements for a SIP. 365 EPA 's guidance memorandum provided that the agency would consider a state 's SIP submittal at least conditionally " complete " if it included : ( i ) fully adopted control measures to obtain at least eighty percent of the emissions reduction necessary for attainment ; ( ii ) similar measures to obtain at least eighty percent of the reasonable further progress reduction ; and ( iii ) a binding commitment to adopt further control measures to obtain the remaining twenty percent of reductions for both attainment and reasonable further progress. 366 <p> In addition , the Submittal Completeness Memorandum required a state to submit a detailed explanation of its need for further time beyond the deadline to submit additional plan elements necessary for the remaining reductions . As an illustration , the memorandum stated that EPA expected to receive a " timeline showing the State 's past and future progress toward completion of modeling and rule adoption in order to justify delays " and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested that the need for development of regional strategies " necessary or appropriate " to abate pollution " may also be suitable explanations for certain delays . " 368 <p> Ironically , EPA 's legal rationale for this policy was based both upon a provision of the CAA and upon a recent court decision rejecting the agency 's prior interpretation of that same provision . Under Section 110(k) ( 4 ) , EPA may " conditionally " approve SIPs , i.e. , give states credit for timely compliance and thereby avoid imposition of sanctions. 369 Until recently , EPA applied this conditional approval authority generously by allowing states to make a submittal that merely contained a promise to submit rules imposing a control measure up to one year after the initial submission . The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit disapproved of EPA 's broad interpretation of the statute and held that Section 110(k) ( 4 ) permitted EPA to approve a submittal conditionally only when the submittal was " substantive , but not entirely satisfactory . " 370 The court concluded that the CAA only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is predominantly complete rather than predominantly incomplete . <p> The court 's holding created a bright-line test prohibiting agency expansion of the conditional approval mechanism to afford states extra time to comply . Confusing matters , however , the District of Columbia Circuit also held that EPA may grant a state an extension when the state was unable to make a complete SIP submittal for reasons clearly beyond its control. 371 The court therefore upheld the one-year extension contrary to the express provisions of the CAA in order to provide states relief . EPA designed its Submittal Completion Memorandum guidance with the District of Columbia Circuit 's admonitions in mind , explicitly stating its conviction that a SIP with eighty percent of required reductions would constitute a substantive , if not entirely satisfactory SIP , especially when accompanied by a detailed explanation of why the other twenty percent of reductions must come later. 372 In essence , EPA implicitly acknowledged that modeling difficulties were a condition beyond a state 's control sufficient to justify an extension . <p> Given the ongoing debate in resolving ozone transport problems , EPA 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means of treating the states with a more flexible or pragmatic approach . The Submittal Completeness Memorandum encouraged states to continue work on SIP attainment plans by allowing an additional year for completion of modeling and development of plans to address ozone transport . The agency policy also encouraged states to work with neighboring states on a regional basis to devise additional control measures . As a reward for this behavior , the policy explicitly stated that EPA would consider the need for time to devise regional approaches to control ozone a prima facie explanation for a request for conditional SIP approval . <p> The EPA 's Submittal Completeness Memorandum was not without critics , however , and environmental groups , industry groups , and a state challenged the agency position. 373 Opponents of the policy believe that EPA has no authority under the CAA or its own completeness regulations to accept , even conditionally , SIPs that contain measures to generate less than one hundred percent of the reductions needed for attainment and reasonable further progress . From a purely legal perspective , environmental groups led by NRDC alleged that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an intentional subversion of the explicit deadlines of the CAA. 374 From a policy perspective , NRDC contended that the acceptance of SIPs with only eighty percent of required reductions will cut short the lead time necessary to develop new control strategies and meet other interim deadlines. 375 Rather than encouraging compliance with the deadline , NRDC predicted that EPA 's policy would invite dilatory behavior by states . NRDC was concerned that states would abuse any conditional approval policy to drag out the date by which it must submit an approvable SIP attainment demonstration for years. 376 <p> The challenges by Massachusetts and Massachusetts industry more directly attacked the Submittal Completeness Memorandum for its failure to stop ozone transport . Whatever its merits to grant states flexibility , Massachusetts alleged that the EPA policy merely allowed upwind states to " shirk responsibility " for the effects of transport on downwind jurisdictions. 377 A Massachusetts industry group alleged that the policy would unfairly impact the economy of the state rather than forcing emission reductions on the upwind sources of the ozone. 378 Massachusetts in particular wants its compliance burden eased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area. 379 <p> In response to these challenges , EPA revoked the Submittal Completeness Memorandum. 380 This result is unfortunate because EPA designed the policy to permit states to submit SIPs that begin to reduce ozone , and at the same time to focus upon development of regional control measures necessary for attainment rather than fight lawsuits to stave off mandatory sanctions . The policy thus allowed EPA to obviate some of the more severe effects of the CAA such as the start of the mandatory sanctions clock for states that were working in good faith to comply with the SIP attainment demonstration requirement . Admittedly , the policy could have been subject to abuse if states used it merely to evade mandatory control measures , but the policy allowed EPA to single out dilatory states that could not adequately establish their need for additional time to obtain the remainder of the reductions . D. Extension of Deadlines for SIP Attainment Demonstrations <p> In response to modeling delays and other complications caused in part by ozone transport , EPA has continued to attempt to modify the attainment demonstration deadlines of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guidance to states " significantly affected by ozone " regarding compliance with SIP attainment demonstration deadlines. 382 The SIP Demonstrations Memorandum provides an alternative means for areas with ozone nonattainment classified as serious and above to demonstrate attainment. 383 Notably , EPA 's policy does not extend the ultimate attainment date for any area . Instead , the policy merely provides additional time for submission of complete attainment demonstrations. 384 The SIP Demonstrations Memorandum outlines a two-phase program in which EPA will cooperate with states to overcome nonattainment resulting from ozone transport. 385 <p> In the first phase , EPA requires states to submit a SIP containing specific control measures to reduce the level of ozone precursors , including reductions to meet reasonable further progress. 386 The memorandum contemplates that states in this phase will make certain interim undertakings to reduce emissions pending development of SIPs that fully demonstrate attainment. 387 EPA will assess the efficacy of these interim plans in most areas on a case-by-case basis. 388 For states in the Northeast OTR , however , the SIP Demonstrations Memorandum stipulates that the SIPs must contain all control measures mandatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NOx memorandum of understanding entered into by the Northeast OTR states , and the OTC LEV or other equivalent alternative measure adopted by the Northeast OTR and approved by EPA. 389 Most importantly , however , the states must submit SIP revisions that contain enforceable commitments to : ( i ) participate in a " consultative process " on regional transport ; ( ii ) adopt more control measures if necessary to reach attainment ; and ( iii ) identify reductions from other jurisdictions that will be necessary for the state to attain the ozone NAAQS. 390 Each state 's new promise to work to develop regional control measures comprises the consideration for EPA 's leniency on currently due SIP demonstrations. 391 This trade is fitting given that a stated reason for attainment demonstration delays has been the difficulty in coping with transported pollutants. 392 <p> The SIP Demonstrations Memorandum includes a second phase , in effect concurrently with the first , in which states must collaborate to evaluate additional " regional control strategies . " 393 EPA is to assist states to " reach consensus " on additional control measures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explicitly provides that if the states are unable to agree upon such measures by the end of 1997 , EPA will use its authority under Sections 126 and 110 to motivate states to meet their attainment obligations regarding transport. 395 In essence , EPA has offered to forbear from prompt exercise of those powers in order to allow states the opportunity to devise new regional solutions voluntarily. 396 In response to this phase of the SIP Demonstrations Memorandum , states formed the Ozone Transport Assessment Group ( OTAG ) . 397 <p> OTAG is comprised of EPA officials , representatives of the states involved , and other interested parties including environmental groups and industry groups. 398 OTAG currently encompasses thirty-seven states east of the Rocky Mountains. 399 OTAG 's goals have been to develop more accurate models to assess ozone transport and to devise new regional control measures to reduce ozone transport. 400 The group has explored a variety of measures , including : ( i ) expansion of the Northeast OTR to include all thirty-seven states of OTAG ; 401 ( ii ) major reductions of NOx emissions across all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new , cleaner automobile fuels. 403 The express purpose of OTAG is to allow states flexibility to come up with their own measures to reduce ozone transport before EPA must begin enforcement of Section 110(a) ( 2 ) ( D ) . 404 <p> EPA 's SIP Demonstrations Memorandum provides answers to critical transport questions under the 1990 CAA . First , in accordance with the statutory mandates of the CAA , EPA confirms that it will require states to comply with the ultimate attainment deadlines rather than granting de facto exemptions by inaction. 405 This approach will , at least officially , discourage the expectation of attainment date slippage that might tempt states to avoid politically unpopular control measures . Second , the EPA guidance allows states to adopt workable interim attainment plans subject to agency approval. 406 This stance will provide states continued flexibility to enact control measures best suited to reach attainment in their jurisdictions . EPA 's guidance only requires states to enact those measures already stipulated by statute or , in the case of the Northeast OTR states , those measures that the states have already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first phase requires states to agree prospectively to enact more control measures if necessary to reach attainment. 408 This implies that states must agree to impose more control measures than otherwise stipulated in the CAA for the applicable category of nonattainment . Finally , EPA confirmed its willingness to enter the fray as an active facilitator in regional efforts to address ozone transport . Rather than imposing mandatory solutions , EPA has chosen the role of catalyst to encourage states to cooperate to find communal solutions . If states do not reach agreement voluntarily , EPA has expressly affirmed its intention to impose solutions under Sections 126 and 110. 409 <p> Critics have challenged EPA 's policy , alleging that it does not go far enough to discourage transport from upwind jurisdictions. 410 NRDC sued for review of the policy alleging that it abrogates the deadlines of the 1990 CAA by permitting EPA to accept SIP submissions that do not " provide for " attainment by the attainment date. 411 NRDC evidently was alluding to the Section 182(c) ( 2 ) ( A ) requirement that states submit SIP revisions that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the applicable attainment date . " 412 Massachusetts has sued for review of the policy claiming that it violates Section 110(k) ( 1 ) and ( k ) ( 3 ) , thereby intimating that the policy allows EPA to accept SIPs that fail to meet all the applicable requirements of the CAA. 413 The state 's particular concern is that the SIP Demonstrations Memorandum allows acceptance of SIPs that fail to abate interstate transport and therefore violates Section 110(a) ( 2 ) ( D ) ( i ) ( I ) . Both suits challenge agency interpretations of the 1990 CAA and must therefore overcome the significant hurdles of a Chevron analysis. 414 Both suits are still pending , presumably awaiting the outcome of the OTAG process . <p> Thus far , EPA 's approach in the SIP Demonstrations Memorandum has had mixed results . Under the first phase , states had to submit interim plans by the end of 1995 to meet rate of progress ozone reductions along with demonstrations of attainment and a commitment to enact other control measures as necessary. 415 In July , 1996 , EPA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the required submissions416 nor were proceeding in a sufficiently expeditious manner to be considered in substantial compliance with Phase I deadlines. 417 This finding by the Agency started the mandatory sanctions clock against all of the jurisdictions. 418 The states must make the required submissions or face sanctions. 419 <p> Meanwhile , under the second phase of the policy , the OTAG process has met resistance from certain states and industry groups . A number of states have passed or threatened to pass legislation restricting the powers of their own representatives to OTAG to bind their states. 420 Other states have threatened to drop out of the OTAG process entirely. 421 Industry groups have mounted campaigns to oppose any new regional control measures that impinge upon their profitability. 422 Some observers are dubious that OTAG will be able to reach any consensus. 423 Other observers have been overtly hostile to the process. 424 In spite of these difficulties , officials at EPA have reiterated the Agency 's intention to utilize Section 110(a) ( 2 ) ( D ) and Section 126 against any state that fails to follow through with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Memorandum should aid downwind states " significantly affected by ozone . " 426 It requires states to submit a SIP that includes the mandatory control measures for the area 's designated nonattainment classification. 427 Compliance with the stipulated measures does not excuse the state from enacting control measures to counteract ozone from upwind states . For example , if an area is severe rather than serious because of transport , it must still enact the control measures for a severe ozone nonattainment area . This obligates states to continue to implement programs necessary to protect the health of its citizens . The relief to downwind states arises from EPA 's requirement that all states agree to participate in cooperative efforts on regional transport , and that all states expressly agree to adopt more stringent control measures than otherwise required under the CAA . The SIP Demonstrations Memorandum is also important because EPA has asserted its willingness to assume a more active role in reduction of transport from upwind jurisdictions and an intention to reject SIPs of states that do not participate in the regional process . EPA is only deferring action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i ) ( I ) for states that act in good faith to devise additional control measures in cooperation with their neighbors . E. Changes in NAAQS and Modeling Assumptions <p> Another alternative solution to relieve downwind states is to change the border assumptions in computer modeling of ozone pollution. 428 Currently , states must utilize either the Regional Oxidant Model ( ROM ) , the Urban Airshed Model ( UAM ) , or a combination of the two in order to perform attainment demonstrations in the SIP process. 429 Regardless of which model is appropriate , states in the Northeast OTR except for Vermont will have difficulty establishing that they can reach attainment. 430 For example , if air crossing the border between New York and Connecticut is already at the NAAQS for ozone , then Connecticut can not add another molecule of ozone precursors without risking a violation of the standard. 431 Both the ROM and UAM models currently factor in the actual amount of ozone measured or estimated at the border of each state , and give no credit or offset for ozone crossing the border from another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ramifications of transported ozone on downwind areas would be to change the standard for the border conditions in the computer models . Instead of setting the border assumptions at a level where the downwind state can not emit anything , EPA could set those standards so as to give the state credit for the amount of the pollutant transported from adjacent jurisdictions. 433 The downwind state could thus avoid punishment for violations that result wholly or in part from ozone transport from the neighboring state , and the downwind state could utilize the full increment of precursor emissions permitted by the CAA . <p> EPA theoretically has the ability to reconcile the problem in this fashion because Congress empowered the Agency to establish the NAAQS by regulation rather than explicitly setting forth the NAAQS by statute. 434 Because EPA has the authority to set the level of the NAAQS , EPA arguably has the power to set that number differently in different contexts to account for the effects of ozone transport. 435 Likewise , the Agency has authority to design the models necessary to assess attainment or nonattainment for pollutants . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specifics of these models for EPA to determine through appropriate rulemaking procedures. 436 Given that both the NAAQS and the models are arguably within EPA 's discretion to establish , EPA could change the border assumptions through the rulemaking process to negate the impact of ozone transport. 437 Assuming that the Agency follows the proper procedures and generates a rational basis for the changes , EPA 's action would likely survive a judicial challenge . Courts have consistently held that EPA is best situated to make determinations based upon scientific information in furtherance of its duties under protective statutes like the CAA and courts therefore grant great deference to EPA actions. 438 The interpretation and use of computer modeling information is particularly within the province of EPA 's discretion and expertise. 439 <p> Notwithstanding the apparent ease with which this approach might alleviate some of the impact of the CAA on downwind jurisdictions , EPA should not follow this course because it will conflict with the explicit policy goals of the statute. 440 The declaration of purposes of the CAA contains an unequivocal statement that Congress intended the statute " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources so as to promote the public health and welfare and the productive capacity of its population . " 441 In addition , Section 109(b) ( 1 ) expressly instructs EPA to establish the NAAQS to provide " an adequate margin of safety " to protect human health. 442 Were EPA to change the border assumptions in the computer models , the Agency would potentially allow a drastic increase in the levels of ozone throughout the Northeast. 443 <p> A change in the model assumptions that would give each state a clean slate for ozone might be defensible in a situation in which the downwind state did not have significant emissions of ozone precursors and therefore the citizens of that state did not risk exposure to significantly elevated levels of ozone . The closer the downwind area 's actual ozone level to the NAAQS , the less objectionable the modeling change . The alteration of model assumptions might also be defensible if the effects of ozone transport did not extend beyond the borders of the next adjacent jurisdiction and therefore did not result in a domino effect . In the Northeast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on emissions would have disastrous effects . For example , an air current that traveled a straight line from Virginia to Maine could cross the borders of eleven jurisdictions . If the approved model allowed each state credit for the level of ozone transported across its borders , and permitted it to emit precursors to create the full amount of ozone allowed by the NAAQS within its borders , there could theoretically be eleven times the current legal standard . In reality , the meteorological and chemical processes involved with ozone transport defy so simple a calculation of the end result , but one may assume that the actual level of ozone could easily exceed the current permissible levels . <p> Similarly , EPA should resist efforts by some states to make out-come-determinative changes in data collection. 444 Critics of the CAA are fond of denigrating the accuracy of the data by pointing out the limited number of monitors and the small number of violations at any given monitor necessary to establish nonattainment. 445 A number of jurisdictions desire to move or deactivate certain air quality monitors as a means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Island officials wish to dispense with a specific monitor because it registers ozone transported across the border from Connecticut. 447 Without further information , it is difficult to assess whether this change would improve the accuracy of modeling in Rhode Island or merely subvert the modeling process. 448 Viewed in the best light , one must question why a state would want to deactivate a monitor that helps establish the contribution of another state to its nonattainment. 449 <p> Comparable efforts are afoot to reduce the size of nonattainment areas as much as possible and thereby to minimize the geographic scope of required control measures . For example , some California politicians want to redraw the boundaries of the air quality district that contains the Mojave Desert. 450 They claim that the area has a higher than necessary nonattainment classification because the monitoring for the area includes data from a specific monitor affected by air from the Los Angeles basin. 451 Characterizing the current boundaries as " gerrymandered , " state politicians want to redraw the boundaries to change the nonattainment classification. 452 In this instance the modification of area boundaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the state itself previously drew the boundaries without regard to proper meteorological analysis . <p> Historically , states designated air quality control regions based primarily upon political considerations such as county or city boundaries with little emphasis upon meteorological considerations . Creation of nonattainment areas based upon political expediency already has resulted in areas with arbitrary borders with little hope for attainment because they fail to encompass necessary emissions sources. 453 Wholesale redefinition of modeling boundaries for the mere purpose of changing nonattainment classifications will lead to inevitable abuse . Rather than redrawing air district borders based upon appropriate scientific criteria , the redrawn borders may derive solely from political criteria . EPA should reject unjustified efforts to modify nonattainment status through the manipulation of borders or the placement of monitors . If states desire to redraw area borders , EPA should require new areas based upon appropriate meteorological considerations. 454 <p> EPA is currently considering significant changes in ozone monitoring in connection with the change of the ozone NAAQS. 455 This change would potentially entail averaging of monitoring data across an area and weighing monitoring data to reflect population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas for management of ozone control and more upon larger regional efforts , with the regions more reflective of the location of unhealthy air rather than existing political boundaries. 457 These types of changes may relieve pressure upon areas subject to transport and help to alleviate the perception that the 1990 CAA imposes inequitable emissions restrictions based upon arbitrary criteria such as the placement of monitors or the boundaries of political jurisdictions . V. LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS OF THE 104TH CONGRESS <p> Members of the 104th Congress have introduced a large number of bills to amend the 1990 CAA . Many of the legislative proposals specifically address the concerns of states with nonattainment areas . The majority of these bills focus on limited issues : ( i ) elimination of mandatory employer trip reduction measures ; 458 ( ii ) elimination or modification of vehicle inspection and maintenance measures ; 459 ( iii ) elimination of requirements for reformulated gasoline ; 460 ( iv ) moratoriums on enforcement action or sanctions by EPA against states ; 461 ( v ) extensions of the attainment deadlines ; 462 or ( vi ) rebukes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the CAA464 or its constituent parts. 465 The less extreme bills merely direct EPA to reconsider its regulations for a specific control measure such as centralized vehicle testing and maintenance. 466 Most of the bills respond to popular outcry over certain control measures that inconvenience drivers. 467 Others reflect thinly disguised attempts to gut environmental regulations because of anti-federal government fervor. 468 A number of bills propose to rein in EPA by statutorily requiring cost-benefit analysis in setting the ozone NAAQS or other agency determinations formerly premised primarily on adequate protection of human health. 469 Many bills appear to be attempts to achieve the goals of the 1990 CAA by moving the goalposts. 470 <p> The 104th Congress has passed two measures with the net effect of weakening two stringent control measures required in the 1990 CAA , mandatory employer trip reduction measures471 and centralized automobile emissions testing , 472 thereby potentially exacerbating ozone transport . Piecemeal dismemberment of the 1990 CAA is not without consequences . For example , dilution of EPA 's centralized inspection and maintenance program and the alleged delay tactics by some states have rendered compliance with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is unclear how areas in the Northeast OTR such as Washington , D.C. , can possibly obtain the same emission reductions without the measure. 474 Environmental groups have sued EPA , demanding that it fulfill its statutory obligation to develop a federal implementation plan and impose it upon recalcitrant states. 475 Similarly , elimination of mandatory employer trip reduction measures is seen by some as evidence of lack of political will to take unpopular stances. 476 <p> Of the remaining legislative initiatives under consideration by the 104th Congress , few strike at the heart of the statutory or policy problems of the 1990 CAA or aid EPA in implementing the statute more effectively . There are four pending bills that warrant closer examination because they illustrate issues under consideration by Congress : ( i ) H.R. 1582 ; ( ii ) H.R. 581 ; ( iii ) H.R. 3519 ; and ( iv ) S. 721 . <p> The House of Representatives is considering one bill that directly addresses the problems of downwind states suffering from ozone transport . H.R. 1582 proposes an amendment to Section 181(a) of the 1990 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factor out the effects of ozone transport. 477 The bill provides that EPA will reclassify areas " to reflect an adjusted ozone design value which excludes ozone concentrations attributable to transport from an upwind area . " 478 If the subtraction of the ozone from transport makes the area " attain " the NAAQS , the bill proposes to require EPA to redesignate the area as attainment. 479 In essence , H.R. 1582 instructs EPA to make nonattainment calculations excluding the ozone resulting from transport , regardless of the true air quality of the area. 480 <p> H.R. 1582 makes this relief widely available by defining a " downwind nonattainment area " broadly to include " a nonattainment area where the air entering the area at the upwind boundary already contains ozone or ozone precursors . " 481 This means of avoiding nonattainment status is thus theoretically available to all areas with any amount of transport . Those areas with the largest proportion of ozone from transport will benefit the most by the change of policy , i.e. , a nonattainment area with no emissions sources will receive the most relief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or near the NAAQS will not receive as large a boon . Significantly , the net effect of the bill is that every state will evidently be able to permit emissions up to the full limit of the NAAQS . <p> H.R. 1582 also extends the right to redesignation to areas that suffer from transport from within the same state. 482 The bill will amend Section 110(a) ( 2 ) ( D ) ( i ) ( I ) to provide that EPA must review SIPs for provisions to prevent significant transport not only from another state , but from areas within the state. 483 On its face , this suggests that EPA will have additional power to halt transport . In practice , however , this may shift to EPA the burden formerly borne by states to insure compliance by sources in different parts of the state . The agency already struggles to determine when a SIP fails to prevent significant contribution from one state to another and this expansion may magnify the agency 's SIP review obligations . State governments profess to want to make all decisions at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it comes to telling the voters in one county that they must endure more stringent control measures for the benefit of voters in another county . <p> If passed , H.R. 1582 will undoubtedly provide statutory relief to downwind areas with significant transport . With the stroke of a pen , these areas will be entitled to lower classifications of nonattainment or may even attain the NAAQS . These areas immediately avoid costly and unpopular control measures necessary to achieve greater emissions reductions from in-state sources . Unfortunately , this attainment will be fictional and the inhabitants of the state may still endure unhealthy levels of ozone . <p> The most serious drawbacks of H.R. 1582 are that it will neither decrease the amount of transport from the upwind jurisdiction nor prevent the downwind state from contributing increased ozone to states further downwind . By artificially negating the effects of transport on downwind states , H.R. 1582 will remove the incentive for those states to exert political and other pressure on upwind states to reduce emissions . Instead of focussing energy on obtaining needed reductions from upwind states , the amendment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested parties to whitewashing the true air quality in downwind areas . Perhaps worst of all , H.R. 1582 will permit a transport domino effect as EPA judges each state down the line only on the basis of its own in-state emissions . Potentially , states at the end of the ozone plume will have air that contains many times the current ozone NAAQS . Assuming that each state has met the truncated CAA requirements and that EPA has observed the procedural niceties , citizens exposed to demonstrably unhealthy air will have no recourse . <p> In another significant pending bill , the House of Representatives is also considering an expansion of the existing exemption for rural transport areas to make the exemption available for all areas subject to transport regardless of population. 484 H.R. 581 proposes an amendment to Section 182(h) of the 1990 CAA to permit both rural and non-rural areas to comply with the nonattainment provisions by observance of the requirements for marginal areas , regardless of their actual level of ozone. 485 Designation as a marginal nonattainment area by operation of law allows a state to evade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as reasonable further progress reductions , enhanced vehicle inspection and maintenance , and ( until recently made voluntary ) employer trip reduction measures. 486 <p> H.R. 581 is extremely significant because it contains a specific percentage level of ozone to define when an area is eligible for the exemption . The bill states that the area qualifies if " the sources of VOC ( and where the Administrator determines relevant , NOx ) emissions within the area do not contribute to more than thirty-five percent of the ozone concentrations measured in the area or in other areas . " 487 Section 182(h) of the current CAA provides that the exemption is available conditioned upon an EPA finding that the sources within the area " do not make a significant contribution " to ozone in the area or elsewhere. 488 The author of H.R. 581 has thus provided explicit guidance on what should constitute " significant contribution " to another jurisdiction 's air quality. 489 <p> The definition of " significant contribution " as thirty-five percent of the downwind state 's ozone level poses interesting problems . For the area itself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sixty-five percent or more of ozone from external sources . This will presumably apply to a limited number of areas with small amounts of local emissions . With regard to the states downwind from this " victim " state , however , it provides less protection . The proposed amendment would allow an exempt area to contribute up to thirty-five percent of the ozone in a downwind area without limitation on the absolute quantity of the pollutant , i.e. , thirty-five percent of one hundred tons of VOCs differs markedly from thirty-five percent of one million tons of VOCs . Deletion of the " rural " limitation by removal of the population requirements for exemption thus potentially permits exemption of areas with large amounts of emissions . Reliance on a fixed percentage deprives EPA of the authority to stop contribution that is significant in terms of absolute quantity , if not in percentage . <p> Arguably , the effects of H.R. 581 alone will not result in drastic increases in ozone transport because the number of areas capable of qualifying for the exemption will be small . The greater danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant contribution " to other contexts . For example , if courts extrapolate that this definition reflects congressional intent for the same standard in Section 110(a) ( 2 ) ( D ) , it will severely limit EPA 's power to stop ozone transport . Definition of " significant contribution " as thirty-five percent is also extremely high in the abstract . Such a high trigger for " significant contribution " under the CAA will mean that downwind states must either limit their own emissions to sixty-five percent of the NAAQS to avoid nonattainment or bear the costs of control measures to offset up to thirty-five percent of their ozone level before they may seek relief from transport. 490 In either case , the downwind state suffers as a result of upwind emissions . This definition of " significant contribution " fails to address the inequities of transport for downwind states and does not adequately restrict transport . <p> Another relevant bill pending before the 104th Congress directly addresses the problem of " overwhelming " ozone transport , i.e. , the situation in which an area can not possibly attain because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ styled " The Clean Air Amendments Act of 1996 , " one member has proposed a broad array of amendments to the 1990 CAA. 492 One segment of this bill would amend Section 181 in order to redesignate an area as attainment , or to lower its nonattainment classification upon an Agency determination that the area suffers from overwhelming transport. 493 Potentially , this change could allow EPA to alleviate some of the statutory pressure upon jurisdictions subject to transport and otherwise unable to reduce ambient ozone levels sufficiently to avoid sanctions. 494 <p> The proposed provision makes sense for a number of reasons . First , the amended Section maintains EPA 's authority and discretion to make the underlying determination and explicitly states that the Agency " may " change the nonattainment designation , rather than " shall " change it. 495 Second , the provision notes that it should be inapplicable in situations where ozone sources in the area at issue make a " significant contribution " to nonattainment in other areas , thereby mitigating the potential domino effect upon areas further downwind. 496 Finally , the proposed provision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area should not be generally available to all nonattainment areas , only those in which indigenous sources do not " make a significant contribution " to the area 's own nonattainment. 497 Unlike H.R. 1582 , this would not be an open invitation to all areas with any transport to seek special dispensation. 498 <p> The latter strength of H.R. 3519 is simultaneously its weakness . By stipulating that EPA may redesignate the area if its indigenous sources do not make a " significant contribution " to its own nonattainment ( or that of another area ) , the bill perpetuates the use of an ambiguous standard. 499 The bill is silent as to what level of contribution should be sufficiently insignificant to justify relief , whether one percent , ninety-nine percent , or some point in between . <p> In addition , H.R. 3519 does not empower EPA to use flexibility with regard to control measures for a nonattainment area subject to overwhelming transport . The two options are merely to lower the area 's nonattainment classification or to redesignate it to attainment. 500 EPA has drawn its own policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the later attainment date of an upwind area , not to avoid controls by redesignation or reclassification. 501 EPA 's policy maintains the downwind area 's obligation to reduce its own emissions and even suggests that the Agency might require more of both the upwind and downwind jurisdictions. 502 In short , H.R. 3519 would instruct EPA simply to ignore the elevated level of ozone and require no further steps to alleviate it . <p> Both houses of Congress are also considering moratoriums or other limitations on EPA enforcement and sanctions authority as a means of relieving states subject to transport. 503 S. 721 is illustrative of these proposals. 504 S. 721 proposes to impose a moratorium on all EPA enforcement action against areas or states designated as marginal or moderate nonattainment. 505 The bill defines enforcement action broadly to include all of EPA 's enforcement levers under the 1990 CAA , including : ( i ) withholding of grants ; ( ii ) imposition of a FIP ; ( iii ) imposition of a sanction ; or ( iv ) any other action " intended to obtain compliance ... or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is intended to offset the unfairness to downwind states whose nonattainment results from ozone transport. 507 <p> S. 721 limits its effect to marginal and moderate nonattainment areas . This is attributable , in part , to the attainment deadlines for those areas that make them the most likely candidates for sanctions . It is also arguably justifiable on environmental and health protection grounds because these areas have relatively lower ozone NAAQS violations than serious , severe , and extreme ozone nonattainment areas . S. 721 in its current form would not restrict EPA 's ability to sanction more seriously polluted areas for such things as failure to implement mandatory control measures . S. 721 is also commendable because it does not seek to dilute the substantive requirements of the CAA , but rather to grant states extra time to enact and implement appropriate control measures . To the extent that this allows states acting in good faith to reduce emissions without fear of harsh economic sanctions , it could encourage states to focus resources on compliance rather than mere avoidance of sanctions through litigation or other delay tactics. 508 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does not limit its applicability to areas suffering from ozone transport . As currently drafted , all areas with marginal or moderate nonattainment could avoid enforcement action of any kind for at least two years509 regardless of whether their nonattainment resulted from transport or their own recalcitrance in implementing necessary control measures . S. 721 thus goes too far in removing EPA 's ability to motivate dilatory states to take responsible action to meet the current attainment dates . EPA 's ability to sanction states with mandatory or discretionary sanctions is effective to get the attention of states unwilling to follow the strictures of the 1990 CAA. 510 <p> As a corollary problem , S. 721 does not go far enough to protect all areas injured by transport . Even severe ozone nonattainment areas such as New York City suffer from inordinate amounts of ozone influx from New Jersey and points south . If , as is the stated goal , S. 721 is to relieve inequity to downwind states , its limitation to marginal and moderate ozone nonattainment areas is untenable . Aside from simple equity for the citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas farther south should receive special dispensation to continue contributing to New York 's nonattainment without fear of retribution through enforcement actions . If the Senate continues consideration of S. 721 , one could expect to see other members seek to expand its scope to include the full range of nonattainment classifications . Such an expansion of the enforcement moratorium would remove all teeth from the CAA and render it purely hortatory for years at a time when stronger action is essential. 511 <p> The legislation currently before the 104th Congress thus does not address the fundamental problems of the 1990 CAA . The bills attempt to treat the symptoms of problems , such as unpopular control measures , but fail to reach the underlying policy questions . If the purpose of the statute is to obtain clean air as expeditiously as possible , should some degree of inequity be tolerated ? Permitting Virginia to evade a particular control measure could conceivably fulfill some larger policy objective . Should the CAA continue to require some states to enact more restrictive control measures than neighboring states ? There may be reasons why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use reformulated gasoline even though their own local emissions would not alone require it under the CAA . Should an upwind state with a later attainment date lose some or all of the benefit of that later attainment date by accelerated imposition of control measures ? There may be legitimate need for New York to accelerate control measures solely to benefit Connecticut and other downwind states . Congress has not sought to elucidate its position on such questions . Based upon the bills currently before Congress , one would assume that repudiation of a control measure or unanesthetized extraction of the CAA 's teeth is all that is required to solve the tropospheric ozone problem . VI . PROPOSED SOLUTIONS <p> As illustrated by the examples discussed above , EPA has gone to great lengths , if not contortions , to devise implementation strategies to reduce the impacts of ozone transport that are still consistent with the provisions of the 1990 CAA . Congress now has an opportunity to clarify how it wants EPA to implement the CAA to abate the epidemic problems of ozone transport . The following suggestions address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to alleviate the inequities , yet encourage continued progress toward attainment . A. Modification of Provisions Applicable to Nonattainment Areas to Aid Downwind Jurisdictions <p> The most pressing need is to provide downwind states with statutory relief from the inequitable impacts of ozone transport under the 1990 CAA. 512 EPA has attempted to interpret the CAA administratively to alleviate some of the harsher effects of the statute but , as discussed above , the Agency is constrained by the provisions of the statute and its efforts have generated judicial challenges. 513 If Congress intends EPA to afford states greater flexibility to meet the goals of the CAA , it should amend the statute accordingly . Three potential changes would provide relief : ( i ) modification of the definition of " nonattainment " to exclude areas that would attain but for the transported pollution from another jurisdiction ( as in the case of international transport scenarios ) ; ( ii ) limitation of required control strategies to those that are necessary to reach a reduction of emissions proportionate to the amount actually generated within the downwind jurisdiction ; and ( iii @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow downwind jurisdictions the same degree of leniency accorded to upwind neighbors . <p> The first proposal to modify the definition of nonattainment to exclude areas that violate the NAAQS because of ozone transport from other jurisdictions requires amendment of the definition of nonattainment in Section 107(d) ( 1 ) ( A ) . 514 Congress could decree that EPA calculate the level of a state 's nonattainment by excluding the ozone that results from transport. 515 This amendment appears necessary purely as a matter of fairness so that the CAA does not penalize states for the misfortune of being downwind from states with substantial emissions. 516 Congress should not , however , merely modify the definition without taking further steps to insure that both upwind and downwind states reduce actual emissions . Changing the definition of " attainment , " without more , may be politically expedient , but it will not remedy the underlying pollution problem . <p> So long as protection of the public health and welfare remains a primary purpose of the CAA , Congress should not amend the statute to permit manipulation of ambient air data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Congress should amend the definition of nonattainment only in conjunction with a number of other requirements to reduce emissions such as : ( i ) unequivocally requiring upwind states to limit precursor emissions to prevent transport even if they are otherwise in attainment ; 517 ( ii ) providing that downwind states benefitted by the new definition must enact practicable control measures to reduce in-state emissions even if the measures exceed those otherwise required ; 518 and ( iii ) instructing EPA to police each state 's in-state emissions for NAAQS attainment more aggressively and to hold the state accountable to keep the air at its own borders beneath the NAAQS to avoid a domino effect. 519 Unless Congress amends the CAA to provide for more stringent reduction of emissions in both upwind and downwind states , a new definition of nonattainment will be an excuse for states to continue with the status quo and avoid unpopular control measures . Changing the definition of nonattainment without clearer directives to reduce ozone precursor emissions will result in more ozone transport , not less . <p> The second proposal to require only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of emissions generated within the state entails amendment of the regime of control measures in Section 182. 520 This change would eliminate the unfairness of requiring states to adopt more intrusive control measures to offset ozone from another jurisdiction. 521 Like the first proposal , this change is also fundamentally at odds with the purpose of the CAA to protect the health of the public , whatever the source of the ozone . Citizens of a downwind state should not suffer exposure to unhealthy levels of ozone from upwind emissions simply because the downwind state has performed some legally required bare-minimum effort to restrict in-state emissions . <p> Congress should amend the CAA to require those control measures necessary to reduce the proportionate in-state contribution to nonattainment only if it can protect adequately the health of the public in another way . Congress could more safely make this change if , for example , it also unequivocally empowers EPA to restrict emissions from upwind states to prevent any transport into a downwind jurisdiction. 522 Without this qualification , a citizen of a downwind state will potentially breathe air that contains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the state will have no legal obligation to take any steps not designed for in-state emissions reductions alone . Again , this amendment without counterbalancing increases of EPA 's power to restrict cross-boundary emissions will exacerbate the ozone problem . <p> The third proposal , i.e. , extending attainment dates for downwind areas , requires revision of the attainment deadlines in Section 181. 523 Such an amendment would allow EPA to extend the attainment dates of downwind areas within the plume of ozone from upwind areas with later attainment dates without the imposition of additional control measures as currently contemplated by Section 181(b). 524 This change is equitable because it would allow downwind states to have as much additional time to comply with the NAAQS as their upwind neighbors , and to avoid additional control measures necessary only as a result of upwind emissions . <p> The obvious drawback of this change is that it may result in a domino effect causing areas further downwind to miss their own attainment deadlines . For example , the New York City area 's attainment date currently makes it more difficult for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If Congress amends the CAA to allow areas such as Boston to enjoy the longer attainment period of an upwind jurisdiction , it presumably will interfere with the attainment of areas farther downwind like Portland , Maine . Maine will probably demand a comparable extension to counteract the later date for Boston . If states repeat this process all across the Northeast OTR , the potential result is that all states may end up with later attainment dates. 525 Such an outcome conflicts with the stated congressional desire to provide for attainment at the earliest possible date . <p> If Congress amends the CAA to provide extensions to alleviate the juxtaposition of differing attainment deadlines , it should do so consistently with EPA 's Overwhelming Transport Memorandum. 526 EPA 's policy allows administrative extensions only after examination of the emissions modeling submitted by both the upwind and the downwind state to determine that neither can do anything practicable to maintain the original attainment deadline . EPA indicated that to grant the extension it might require adoption of additional control measures by downwind states and acceleration of control measures by upwind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more of both states than otherwise stipulated in the CAA . Any amendment to the CAA to provide extensions to downwind states under these circumstances should ratify EPA 's policy and confirm explicitly that EPA may impose additional control measures and thereby avoid the potential domino effect for states farther downwind . Such an amendment would make moot the current challenges to EPA 's policy. 527 B. Creation of a Mechanism for States to Initiate EPA Review of Ozone Transport from Upwind States <p> A second necessary form of relief is the creation of an effective means for states subject to transport to petition EPA to assess the validity of an upwind state 's SIP for compliance with Section 110(a) ( 2 ) ( D ) . At present , states may submit comments during the Agency review of another state 's SIP but , absent a pending EPA SIP review , a state has no easy mechanism to direct EPA attention to a particular transport problem. 528 Section 110(a) ( 2 ) ( D ) provides a downwind state with no independent right to seek review of an upwind state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the downwind state 's nonattainment. 529 Section 126 ostensibly provides states with such a mechanism , but the nature of the sources encompassed and the high threshold necessary for redress severely limit its relevance. 530 To date , it has provided little direct assistance for downwind states for any pollutant and its utility for ozone transport is probably even more attenuated. 531 <p> Congress should create a new mechanism for states to focus EPA attention on specific transport problems other than the small universe of contexts in which Section 126 is applicable . This right could be analogous to Section 126 , but specifically allow the petitioner to seek redress for transport from a broader spectrum of sources that generate ozone precursors. 532 It would be unwise , however , to allow states to force EPA to review another state 's entire SIP without adequate grounds . The normal SIP review process is very time and resource intensive and it would tax the Agency 's already limited resources to investigate each and every alleged instance of " significant contribution " to the complaining state 's nonattainment. 533 Allowance of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effects of specific sources is thus preferable . Similarly , the right to petition should be limited to states that can establish more than de minimis transport effects , like EPA 's current policy for states or areas subject to " overwhelming transport . " 534 <p> In the past , Congress has allowed EPA to set the threshold at which redress for transport is available to a downwind state . Hence , the Agency has stringent standards for relief in Section 126 proceedings . More recently , Congress has empowered EPA to take a stronger role in transport abatement by strengthening the standard of SIP review in Section 110(a) ( 2 ) ( D ) . In the process of instructing EPA how to assess new control measures proposed by the Northeast OTC in Section 184(c) , Congress also indicated a desire to allow states to enact more stringent regional control measures that EPA finds are " necessary " to allow the states to attain the ozone NAAQS. 535 This standard is more protective of downwind states because it shifts the focus of the analysis to the effect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and out-of-state emissions. 536 Congress should consider mandating the use of the necessity standard for review of state petitions that allege unacceptable contribution of transported ozone from an upwind state , rather than the more vague " significant contribution " standard currently in both Section 126 and Section 110 . The analysis would thus be whether the elimination of ozone transport is necessary to allow the downwind state to attain . The former analysis of the relative proportions of in-state and out-of-state contributions should be subsumed in the analysis of interstate equity issues as discussed below . C. Stricter Enforcement of Section 110(a) ( 2 ) ( D ) to Address Resource Allocation Issues <p> Congress has gradually strengthened EPA 's authority to review SIPs for their effects upon other states. 537 The standard of SIP scrutiny has risen from checking for mere inclusion of " information exchange " provisions to insuring substantive prohibition of significant contribution. 538 Thus far , Congress has left to EPA the determination of what degree of contribution is significant and what amount of transport is a violation of the standard of Section 110(a) ( 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 539 This reflects EPA 's inherent expertise to resolve complex technological determinations regarding pollution and its effects. 540 Unfortunately , the transfer of responsibility to EPA has also provided a means for Congress to avoid the underlying issues of interstate pollution prevention . Recently , members of the 104th Congress have voiced their concerns that the CAA is inequitable to some states. 541 This may indicate the first willingness to confront the difficulties at the heart of the CAA transport provisions . <p> Air is a resource shared by all in common . Without adequate controls , individuals will use this resource according to the paradigm of the tragedy of the commons. 542 Absent a strong regulating force , individual states will continue to allow use of air resources in ways that are in their own self-interest . An upwind state will not voluntarily close down or restrict its industry and put its citizens out of work to benefit a downwind state. 543 The political , economic , and social costs make restriction of emissions for the benefit of others perhaps hundreds of miles away unattractive . Externalizing the true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Unfortunately , this behavior will result in decreased air quality for all. 544 <p> The hesitancy of EPA to use Section 110(a) ( 2 ) ( D ) ( i ) ( I ) aggressively may result in part from fear of the Gordian Knot of " interstate equity . " 545 Under what circumstances should EPA permit one state to pollute the air of another ? Interstate equity would require EPA to address the problem of ozone transport in a way that fairly allocates the benefits and burdens associated with the resolution among the states . For example , an analysis of the SIPs of two adjoining states with a shared transport problem might require EPA to explore factors such as : ( i ) whether pollutant sources in each state are new or existing and the relative proportions thereof in each state ; ( ii ) whether the states have SIPs with equal standards for emissions and equal control measures ; ( iii ) whether the states enforce their SIPs equally vigorously ; ( iv ) whether the nonattainment status of either state results from sources within its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relative proportions of indigenous and transported pollutants in each state ; ( v ) whether the states have an equivalent number of drivers or vehicles and the degree to which cross-border commuters contribute to the problem of one jurisdiction or the other ; and ( vi ) the relative economic impacts of various solutions upon each state . The sheer complexity of such an analysis is daunting . The variables would cause a quagmire . The amount of political will and patience it would require to resolve the issues to the satisfaction of the affected parties is tremendous . At present , the CAA provides EPA with no guidance to resolve transport disputes between states except in the broadest terms of alleviating " significant contribution . " <p> It is unreasonable to expect states to act altruistically at all times . Thus , some entity must protect air resources and insure that they are shared , if not strictly equitably , at least according to a rational distribution plan agreed upon by the appropriate parties . Either EPA or Congress should resolve the fundamental issues of resource allocation directly by agreed-upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to engage in the complex technical , economic , and political analysis that is necessary to devise an appropriate plan for resource allocation. 546 Based upon the historical development of the CAA and EPA 's efforts to implement its provisions , however , it is possible to observe that the ozone transport problem is far from solved . The last three revisions of the CAA included progressively more stringent requirements for SIP reviews . When the stakes for nonattainment of the ozone NAAQS were lower , there was less political pressure to devise more protective standards . Now that costly and unpopular mandatory control measures directly affect downwind states , these states will clamor for more direct resolution of allocation issues. 547 VII . CONCLUSION <p> Ground level ozone pollution is an increasingly critical concern throughout the United States and in the northeastern states in particular . Because ozone can travel great distances in the atmosphere , it often exacerbates the air quality in geographic areas far downwind from the sources that generated its precursor chemicals . These downwind areas are often within different states , subject to different SIPs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emissions . Despite this lack of control over the upwind precursor emissions , the 1990 CAA penalizes the downwind jurisdiction for nonattainment without regard to the actual sources of the ozone . This problem is particularly acute in the northeast corridor of the United States , where prevailing winds and a chain of densely populated areas create a mass of ozone-laden air that subjects each downwind state to ozone from neighboring states . <p> The issue of ozone transport under the CAA raises essential questions about the nation 's pollution policy . How should the law allocate the benefits and burdens of pollution control ? Is it equitable that one jurisdiction through the vagaries of geography and meteorology should suffer both from the adjacent state 's pollution and from the nation 's laws ? Why must downwind states bear additional burdens of pollution control when the measures will not significantly alleviate the pollution and when upwind states could easily do more to reduce pollution ? The current CAA relies too heavily on the altruism of one state to preserve the air quality of another . It takes tremendous political will to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of automobiles by one 's own citizens ; it is more difficult to do so when it is for the benefit of citizens of distant jurisdictions . <p> EPA has recognized fundamental inconsistencies or inequities in the CAA statutory language concerning nonattainment areas . The Agency has attempted to devise administrative policies to alleviate some of the burden that ozone transport imposes on downwind states and to prevent creation of unfair burdens on upwind states . EPA geared these policies to minimize inequities while still requiring expeditious progress towards attainment of the ozone NAAQS by all areas in all states . EPA is now embroiled in litigation to defend its policies , hounded by both pro-and anti-environmental forces . <p> Congress has indicated its readiness to amend the 1990 CAA to rectify perceived problems . Rather than weakening the statute by revoking control measures , delaying compliance , or diluting EPA 's powers , Congress should look to the fundamental underlying problems of resource allocation . Either Congress should directly address the issue of resource allocation in interstate pollution contexts , or it should unequivocally empower EPA to make such decisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through SIP reviews in Section 110(a) ( 2 ) ( D ) and Section 126 have not been effective enough . Congress should openly debate and decide what constitutes " significant contribution " in the transport context . This may result in an inadequately protective standard like that in legislation already proposed in the 104th Congress , but at least it will reflect a consensus of opinion on the fundamental question . Alternatively , and probably preferably , Congress should explicitly empower EPA to determine what constitutes " significant contribution " on a case-by-case basis and to impose more stringent control measures as necessary for attainment . Federal regulation and federal agencies are popular whipping boys in the present political climate , but interstate pollution prevention is one area in which strong federal authority is essential .

The necessity of intense sunshine and high temperatures to the creation of ozone results in an ozone " season " during which ozone formation peaks .

Ozone transport is not purely an urban problem . EPA monitoring and modeling have demonstrated that transport from northeastern cities has invaded such otherwise pristine wilderness areas as Maine 's Acadia National Park with ozone levels in excess of the NAAQS . Even Alaska 's remote Denali National Park suffers from smog transported from Pacific Rim countries .

See , e.g. , Bob Wyss , Ozone Alert May Mean Bad News for Drivers , PROVIDENCE , July 20 , 1995 , at 1A . Like many other areas , Rhode Island had petitioned EPA to designate the state as in attainment because of fortuitously low ozone readings for 1993 and 1994 . Id . Halfway through the 1995 ozone season , the state 's petition was moot because of multiple ozone violations . Id . The Pittsburgh area was on the verge of attainment , but 17 ozone violations during 1995 means that EPA will likely redesignate it as serious nonattainment instead .

One bill in Congress actually proposes an amendment to the CAA to include a congressional finding that 1988 was a " climatelogical anomaly " and to specify that exclusion of 1988 data changes a number of key calculations . See H.R. 46 , 104th Cong. , 1st Sess. ( 1995 ) . Another bill similarly proposes to designate 1995 a climatelogical anomaly and to instruct EPA to disregard the 1995 data in connection with consideration of areas for redesignation to attainment . See H.R. 3446 , 104th Cong. , 2d Sess. section 109 ( 1996 ) . EPA noted a similar " climatological anomaly " in 1983 and it is likely that they recur on a cyclical basis .

It claims that 1988-90 data rendered 38 areas in the Northeast OTR as nonattainment , whereas 1992-94 data would render only 13 of these areas as nonattainment . Id . Data shopping for outcome-determinative years is unwise and ignores meteorological cycles . Rather than omitting years with data inconsistent with the policy preferences of the analyst , it might be preferable to include a longer span of years in the nonattainment calculation to obtain a more statistically accurate determination . One bill introduced in Congress proposes an amendment that would require EPA to make attainment determinations by looking at data for five consecutive years and dropping out the years with the highest and lowest number of exceedences of the ozone NAAQS .

EPA qualified this figure by noting that it only takes into account the counties that have ozone monitors and reflects only one year 's data . Id . at 97 . The actual number exposed to high level ozone may be higher . See id . at 96 . EPA 's 1994 estimate was that 50 million people lived in areas with air that violated the ozone NAAQS .

The Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee ( CASAC ) unanimously recommended the switch from a one-hour standard to an eight-hour standard and all members recommended a reduction of the concentration of ozone from .12 ppm to somewhere in the range of .07 to .09 ppm . Id . Significantly , CASAC noted that there was no true " safe " level of ozone because it " may elicit a continuum of biological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question thus becomes one of balancing the risks against the difficulties of reducing the ambient concentration level . Representative Waxman has expressed concern that certain changes in the standard would transform nonattainment areas into attainment areas without achieving any emission reductions , thereby meeting the goals of the 1990 CAA only by moving the goalposts . See Cost/Benefit Analysis Not Needed For Setting Health-Based Ozone Standards , EPA Official Says , Env't Rep. ( BNA ) No. 26 , at 1203-04 ( Nov. 17 , 1995 ) . A Harvard School of Public Health researcher concluded that the proper ozone NAAQS should be either 0.10 or even 0.08 ppm rather than the current 0.12 ppm . See David L. Chandler , Ozone Worries Scientists , Who Call for New Standards , BOSTON GLOBE , July 12 , 1995 , at 21 . With regard to Boston , he estimated that this lower standard would have resulted in 50 violations of the NAAQS in the summer of 1994 rather than the six that occurred with the present standard . For example , the Ohio EPA anticipates that nearly every area in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard in the middle of the range under consideration . See Nichols , supra note 35 . If EPA chooses the strictest standard advocated by the American Lung Association of 0.07 ppm with only one allowable exceedence per year , almost every area in the country would fail to attain . See id . If EPA chooses the most lenient standard under consideration , 0.09 ppm with five allowable exceedences per year , many areas currently designated as nonattainment could comply . See id . The American Petroleum Institute commissioned an analysis of the number of nonattainment areas there would be nationwide using various permutations of concentration level and number of allowable exceedences based upon 1993-95 data . See Standard-Setting Process for Ozone , PM to Be Coordinated Under New EPA Process , Env't Rep. ( BNA ) No. 27 , at 372 ( May 31 , 1996 ) . The analysis reportedly reflected a vast divergence in the number of nonattainment areas possible , e.g. , 0.075 ppm with five exceedences would result in 260 nonattainment areas , whereas 0.105 ppm with three exceedenees would only result in 19 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Section 182 specifies required control measures for each category of nonattainment with each higher level requiring the control measures of the preceding level plus more aggressive measures . Id . The more serious the nonattainment , the longer the deadline for reaching attainment . Id . 157 Milestones are specific percentage reductions of VOCs to encourage gradual progress towards attainment . Moderate , serious , severe , and extreme ozone nonattainment areas must reduce VOC emissions by 15% over the six years following enactment of the 1990 CAA . After that 15% , serious , severe , and extreme areas must further reduce VOC emissions by 3% per year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states must also generate reductions to offset all new increases in emissions after the base year .

Id . section 7511a(f). 159 Section 183 requires EPA to develop further control strategies to address ozone precursor emissions and to make those strategies available to states through guidance documents . The purpose of the federal control measures is to devise new methods to control hitherto unregulated emissions sources such as consumer products like paints and solvents . Id . section 7511b. 160 Id . section 7511c. 161 A long-stated goal of the CAA is to encourage interstate cooperation , and the CAA contains a formal advance consent of Congress to compacts or other binding agreements between states .

See OTC LEV Final Rule , supra note 58 , at 4719. 169 42 U.S.C. section 7511c(c). 170 The legislative history indicates that Congress purposely placed this burden upon EPA to preclude agency inaction . For example , Senator Lieberman noted : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommended by the Commission .

See OTC LEV Final Rule , supra note 58 , at 4713. 180 See infra note 335 and accompanying text . EPA has expressed its intention to utilize Section 110(a) ( 2 ) ( D ) against states that fail to institute appropriate control measures on all sources of ozone precursors to combat transport . 181 42 U.S.C. section 7410(a) ( 2 ) ( D ) ( i ) . 182 One commentator has branded the standard " no standard at all " and compared it to Justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he saw it .

See 696 F.2d 147 , 164 ( 2d Cir. 1982 ) . 185 EPA instead opted for a reasonable interpretation of the statute to prevent " significant " or " substantial " contribution of pollutants to nonattainment areas . See Air Pollution Control Dist. of Jefferson County , Ky. v. EPA , 739 F.2d 1071 , 1091 ( 6th Cir. 1982 ) . 186 42 U.S.C. section 7410(a) ( 2 ) ( D ) ( i ) . 187 Courts had already effectively read into section 110(a) ( 2 ) ( E ) of the 1977 CAA the " significant contribution " standard of section 126 .

See Talkington , supra note 107 , at 975. 195 Legislative history confirms the concern of Congress . See , e.g. , H.R. REP .

No. 95-95 , section 108 , 91 Stat. 685 , 693 ( 1977 ) . 197 The standard in section 110 now prohibits emissions that would " contribute significantly to nonattainment in , or interference with maintenance by , any other State . " 42 U.S.C. section 7410(a) ( 2 ) ( D ) . In an earlier incarnation , this provision required prohibition of emissions that would " prevent attainment or maintenance by any other State .

See Ozone Nonattainment Under the Clean Air Act : Hearing Before the Subcomm. on Tech. , Env't , and Aviation of the House Comm. on Science , Space , and Tech. , 103rd Cong. , 2d Sess. 33-34 ( 1994 ) ( statement of Don Theiler , Director , Bureau of Air Management , State of Washington ) hereinafter Ozone Hearing . 209 EPA has acknowledged that additional controls in areas subject to transport may be " futile " and that it is " implicit in the CAA that the purpose of control measures is to achieve attainment .

See Ozone Hearing , supra note 208 , at 25. 212 The rural western counties of Michigan provide the quintessential example . These areas suffer from significant ozone pollution despite a lack of significant sources of the precursor chemicals . The ozone evidently results almost exclusively from transport from the Chicago metropolitan area and thus any controls imposed by the state of Michigan will have little , if any , result . EPA officials have acknowledged that the CAA requires controls that the Agency knows will not improve the area 's air quality . See Areas With Transported Ozone May Get To Extend Attainment Deadline , Nichols Says , Dally Env't Rep. ( BNA ) No. 141 , at D-12 ( July 26 , 1994 ) ( acknowledging futility of control measures for western Michigan ) hereinafter Areas With Transported Ozone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The four triggers are nonsubmittal , incompleteness , substantive unapprovability , and nonimplementation of SIPs . Id . section 7509(a). 215 Section 179(b) includes two mandatory sanctions : ( i ) suspension of certain federal highway funds ; and ( ii ) offset requirements for development that require a two to one ratio of reductions for new sources in the nonattainment areas of the state . EPA must impose one of the sanctions after 18 months and must impose the other after an additional six months ff the state has not corrected the deficiency . Id . section 7509(a)-(b). 216 EPA contends that it may issue sanctions within its discretion under section 110(m) for 18 months following a finding and must issue sanctions thereafter in accordance with section 179(b) . Unlike mandatory sanctions , EPA may impose discretionary sanctions statewide under certain circumstances and it is not limited to nonattainment areas . See Criteria for Exercising Discretionary Sanctions Under Title I of the Clean Air Act , 59 Fed . Reg. 1476 ( 1994 ) ; see also Natural Resources Defense Council v.

Environmental Defense Fund , Inc. v. EPA , 82 F.3d 451 , 458-60 ( D.C. Cir. 1996 ) . In upholding the Agency 's interpretation , the court noted that even if the challenger 's reading of the statute was perfectly reasonable , the court must still defer to a reasonable reading of the statute by EPA .

The court nevertheless upheld the Agency 's interpretation as reasonable even though its reading of contributions to emissions reductions could mean no reductions whatsoever . See id . at 460. 314 Congress was concerned that states had not made adequate progress toward reducing ozone pollution and sought to discourage dilatory tactics by setting explicit deadlines for improvement . See Waxman , Overview , supra note 153 , at 1742-46. 315 The dates for attainment are as follows : ( i ) moderate areas have until 1996 ; ( ii ) serious areas have until 1999 ; ( iii ) severe areas have until 2005 , or in some cases until 2007 ; and ( iv ) extreme areas have until 2010 . See 42 U.S.C. section 7511(a) ( 1 ) - (2). 316 The congressional rationale for this approach was that areas with more serious nonattainment would need longer periods to comply and that such areas should seek more aggressively to reach attainment . See id. ; Waxman , Overview , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7511(b). 318 Thus , for example , a state with a moderate ozone nonattainment area must enact control measures required for marginal nonattainment areas plus additional control measures specified in the statute for moderate areas . See 42 U.S.C. section 7511a(a)-(b) . A state with a serious ozone nonattainment area must impose controls appropriate for marginal and mederate areas plus those measures designated for serious areas and so on .

If the second analysis assuming border conditions after the date of the upwind jurisdiction 's attainment deadline does not show attainment , then there is overwhelming transport from the upwind state .

In a redesignation of an area in Michigan , however , EPA considered evidence that the area itself contributed ozone to a nonattainment area in Indiana beset by overwhelming transport . EPA found the modeling inconclusive to deny the redesignation , but retained the right to issue a later finding that the Michigan area 's SIP violated section 110(a) ( 2 ) ( D ) and to require additional control measures to stop transport if subsequent information established the impact of transport .

The lack of sufficient data for UAM models was at least one reason EPA had to rely exclusively on the ROM model to determine the efficacy of the OTC LEV control measure on the entire Northeast OTR. 430 See OTR TECHNICAL SUPPORT DOCUMENT , supra note 23 , at 2. 431 Just such situations exist in the Northeast OTR . See , e.g. , Sharon Voas , Smog Sneaks In , PITT . POST-GAZETTE , May 19 , 1996 , at A1 ( noting that monitors in rural southwest Pennsylvania registered readings at or above the ozone NAAQS before the air even reached Pittsburgh on the days that Pittsburgh violated the NAAQS in 1995 ) . 432 Some states subject to ozone transport have pressured EPA to change this .

This change would make the ozone NAAQS less stringent because ozone production typically peaks during a certain portion of the day and then dissipates . If the peak is the average over eight hours it will usually be lower than the highest one hour peak . See Tim Bonfield , Some Say Smog Law Too Strict , CIN . ENQUIRER , Aug. 22 , 1995 , at A1. 436 In the case of models for ozone transport , Congress has instructed EPA in section 184(d) to issue criteria for evaluating the level of contribution of sources in one area to the nonattainment in another and has stipulated only that the criteria must require the " best available air quality monitoring and modeling techniques . " 42 U.S.C. section 7511c(d) . Even this direct instruction , however , merely requires EPA to exercise its discretion to determine what is the best available under the circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modifications is reflected in the current debate over changing the ozone NAAQS as a means to transmogrify nonattainment areas into attainment areas instantly without enacting additional unpopular control measures . See supra note 39 . One member of Congress has introduced a bill to stipulate the averaging period , the concentration level , the monitoring , and the number of exceedences permitted per year , thereby depriving EPA of authority to set these standards . See H.R. 3446 , 104th Cong. , 2d Sess. section 108 ( 1995 ) .

See , e.g. , Nichols Testimony , supra note 19 ( noting that the agency could either ignore the quality of the air at the borders and force downwind areas to enact stricter controls or else work for more cost effective means to control transport from upwind areas , i.e. , ignoring the pollution was not an option enumerated ) . 441 42 U.S.C. section 7401(b) ( 1 ) . The definition of effects on welfare in section 302(h) is extremely inclusive : All language referring to effects on welfare includes , but is not limited to , effects on soils , water , crops , vegetation , manmade materials , animals , wildlife , weather , visibility , and climate , damage to and deterioration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects on economic values and on personal comfort and well-being , whether caused by transformation , conversion , or combination with other air pollutants . <p> Id . section 7602(h). 442 Id . section 7409(b) ( 1 ) . 443 For example , a Rhode Island monitor on the border with Connecticut reportedly registers ozone levels at or near the ozone NAAQS regularly . See Wyss , supra note 29 . Exclusion of this ozone could thus expose Rhode Island residents to twice the ozone NAAQS. 444 There are already serious problems with state underestimation of emissions and overestimation of reductions .

For example , in the redesignation of Grand Rapids , Michigan , EPA relied upon data from two counties comprising the nonattainment area . See Grand Rapids Redesignation , supra note 209 . In so doing , EPA declined to include data from monitors in adjacent counties that commenters contended registered enough violations to halt the redesignation . Id . 447 See Wyss , supra note 29 . Critics are unhappy with a West Greenwich , R.I. , monitoring station that they believe penalized the state for air emanating from the New York City area . 448 Data from 1995 indicates that transported ozone registered at the monitor is not the sole cause of the state 's violations .

Another bill would accomplish the same outcome by statutorily defining a violation of the standard as an average concentration of 0.10 ppm over an eight-hour period at two monitors in the area with four violations allowed per year . See H.R. 3446 , 104th Cong. , 2d Sess. section 108 ( 1996 ) . A study commissioned by the American Petroleum Institute reportedly concluded that if EPA sets the standard as an eight hour concentration of .105 ppm with only three allowed exceedences , based upon 1993-95 data there would only be 19 nonattainment areas nationwide . See Standard Process for Ozone , PM to be Coordinated Under New EPA Process , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( May 31 , 1996 ) .

The bill intends that rural transport areas need only comply with the control measures set out in the statute for areas with a marginal designation , regardless of whether the deadline for such areas has passed . In addition , however , EPA may continue to designate other new nonattainment areas in the future to which these control measures would apply .

REC. , S4589 ( daily ed . Mar. 24 , 1995 ) ( statement of Sen.

See supra note 216 and accompanying text . 509 In reality , the delay of attainment could be far longer if at the end of one year EPA must issue a finding of SIP insufficiency and the state has eighteen months before mandatory sanctions apply . Even then , the state may make a facially sufficient SIP submission that EPA must review and ultimately reject giving the state further time to comply . Clearly a state intent on " gaming " the CAA could drag out the process considerably , all to the detriment not only of its own citizens , but those of other states as well who might have to endure more stringent control measures as a result . 510 See , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Delete Requirement For Test-Only I/M Facilities , ENV'T REP . ( BNA ) No. 26 , at 1262 ( Nov. 24 , 1995 ) ( the mere threat of sanctions had five governors pleading their case directly to Sen. Dole and Rep. Gingrich ) . 511 The prospect of blanket extensions shows a shocking lack of historical perspective on the series of ignored attainment dates that made the explicit firm deadlines of the 1990 CAA necessary in the first place . 512 See supra Section III . 513 See supra Section IV . 514 42 U.S.C. section 7407(d) ( 1 ) ( A ) . 515 The 104th Congress has proposed such a measure . See supra Section V ( discussion of H.R. 1582 ) . 516 See supra note 201 and accompanying text . 517 For example , Congress might amend the CAA to provide explicitly that the ozone NAAQS are not a quota for emissions and that EPA may lower the NAAQS for all or part of a state to prevent transport from a given area . 518 What would be " practicable " would entail difficult political decisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more control measures it would alleviate more transport . For example , section 182(h) now permits rural transport areas to comply by enacting the mandatory measures for marginal nonattainment areas . Congress might follow this precedent and require redesignated areas to continue to impose the measures for a specific category of nonattainment or to choose from a menu of reasonable control measures . 519 Increased EPA enforcement would be essential to prevent abuse of the redesignation . Congress must be willing to make EPA 's authority more explicit than the current " significant contribution " standard of section 110(a) ( 2 ) ( D ) and must be willing to provide sufficient appropriations for the increased cost of modeling and enforcement apparatus . 520 42 U.S.C. section 7511a. 521 See supra note 204 and accompanying text . 522 The more transport EPA can prevent , the less harmful exposure the citizens of downwind states must endure because of reduced control measure requirements . EPA should not have to extract commitments from states by cutting deals as it appears to have done in the SIP Demonstrations Memorandum . See supra note 391 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ See supra note 209 and accompanying text . 525 All jurisdictions will probably gravitate toward the last attainment date in the region , at which point officials in the most severely polluted jurisdiction likely will argue that they need additional time because of the contribution from other areas and thus start a new round of extensions . 526 See supra note 324 and accompanying text . 527 See supra note 347 and accompanying text . 528 See supra note 108 and accompanying text . 529 See New York v. EPA , 852 F.2d 574 , 577-79 ( D.C. Cir. 1988 ) . The right to petition is limited expressly to states . In the redesignation of an area in Wisconsin , one commenter contended that EPA had failed to enforce prohibitions against interstate pollution . EPA 's response was , in essence , that because no state had filed a section 126 petition , the Agency had no duty to consider the issue . See Wisconsin Redesignation , supra note 355 , at 43,669. 530 See supra note 123 and accompanying text . 531 States are left floundering for a viable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governor sent a letter to EPA in August of 1995 demanding action to reduce ozone transport and had to provide a vague basis for his claim under section 110 and section 126 , neither of which really provide a vehicle for independent review of another state 's complete SIP on demand . Significantly , Governor King proposed to waive Maine 's right to a resolution of the section 126 petition within sixty days if EPA would make certain concessions . Chief among these is the Agency 's stipulation that transport of ozone into Maine " significantly contributes " to the state 's nonattainment . Governor King wants this stipulation to remove " the unrealistic burden " of proving this fact . Even if EPA could ignore the express language of section 126 that limits its applicability to major stationary sources , failure to develop modeling proof would render it impossible to identify the sources subject to emission restrictions or cessation in accordance with section 126(c) . Moreover , it is unclear how EPA could waive proof of a standard that would prejudice sources in other states . These complications highlight the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transport . Maine doubtless suffers from ozone transport , but proving this fact and obtaining relief are difficult under the current CAA . See Letter from Angus S. King Jr. , Governor of Maine , to Carol Browner , Adm'r , EPA , regarding " Maine 's Ozone Attainment Deadline , Overwhelming Transport Designation , Section 110/126 Petitions " ( Aug. 1 , 1995 ) hereinafter Maine Demand Letter . By letter , EPA deferred action upon Maine 's petition pending the outcome of OTAG 's inquiries and efforts to develop more regional control measures . See Letter from Mary D. Nichols , Assistant Adm'r for Air and Radiation , EPA , to the Honorable Angus S. King , Jr. , Governor of Maine ( Sept. 5 , 1995 ) ( on file with author ) . 532 The inherent limitations in modeling would likely limit the use of such a provision to the most egregious situations . Modeling to show the precise source of ozone is difficult . Only the most clear-cut of cases allow redress . Unless a state could establish that its nonattainment stemmed from transport from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this way , Congress could avoid abuse of the mechanism . 533 The court New York v. EPA noted that it would paralyze the Agency to review a SIP repeatedly without adequate time and resources . New York v.

See supra note 71. 540 See supra note 435. 541 See , e.g. , 141 CONG . REC . S5604 ( daily ed . Apr. 24 , 1995 ) ( statement of Sen. Snowe introducing S. 721 ) ; 141 CONG . REC . S4590 ( daily ed . Mar. 24 , 1995 ) ( statement of Sen. Levin introducing H.R. 622 ) . 542 See supra note 61. 543 Recent events suggest that states will not even risk asking their citizens to endure an inconvenient wait for an automobile inspection . See , e.g. , Milne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emissions testing ) . Attempts at implementing the reformulated gasoline control measure in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin indicated that the public would not even pay 5 to 15 cents more per gallon of gasoline and would rather foist the problem off on industry . See Mobile Sources Not Big Game For Nitrogen Oxide , OCTANE WK. , Feb. 5 , 1996. 544 This is the natural course of events in the tragedy of the commons scenario . See supra note 61. 545 For an insightful exploration of the nuances of this concept in the context of interstate air pollution , see Silverstein , supra note 52. 546 Commentators have proposed workable plans . One would require enactment of specific regional plans to allocate both " decrements , " where the states must allocate reductions in existing emissions to attain the NAAQS , and " increments , " where states may share permissible new emissions comparable to the PSD increment analysis currently in section 163 . See 42 U.S.C. section 7473 . In each formula , the decision maker must balance complex variables with whatever form of fairness is agreed upon . See @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 547 See , e.g. , Maine 's Demand Letter , supra note 531 . Maine demanded that EPA : ( i ) grant redesignations , NOx waivers , and Northeast OTR opt-out petitions ; ( ii ) allow designation as an overwhelming transport region ; ( iii ) accelerate regional control measure initiatives ; and ( iv ) take decisive action against other states under section 110 and section 126 . Similar demands were made by New York and business interests in Pennsylvania . See supra notes 49 , 265 . <p> <p> By Geoffrey L. Wilcox <p> <p> B.A. June , 1983 , Dartmouth College ; J.D.
