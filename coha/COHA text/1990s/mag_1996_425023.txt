As the bland accents of the television anchormen bring us the news of Bob Dole 's latest triumph in the Republican primaries , lifting the candidate so many delegates closer to the office he has sought with an unsettling , Ahab-like intensity for almost two decades , viewers may be excused for feeling . that the 1996 campaign is over before it has properly begun . The campaign this winter looks less like the presidential elections familiar from history books , with their great debates and torchlight rallies and famous skulduggery  --  Kennedy defeating Nixon with votes from the restless and partisan cemeteries of Chicago  --  than like a half-forgotten ritual , enacted for reasons that have little to do with the living practice of democracy . Between March 5 and March 28 , in an unprecedentedly brief span of time at an implausibly early point in the year , Republican primary voters will elect nearly 70 percent of the 1,988 delegates who will choose the party 's nominee at its convention this summer in San Diego . The candidate they select will be Senator Dole , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ticket , will be defeated by President Clinton in the fall . Those searching for reasons why such confident predictions can be made about an election in which the first primary vote will not be cast-as I write-for same two and a half months would do well to ignore the televised chatter about straw polls and endorsements and to look instead to more anonymous settings , such as the Independence Room at the Sheraton Motel in Boston Even thinking about such a place  --  with its fluorescent lights and frosted mint green synthetic carpets , its walls of floral wallpaper , dulled and smeared by the aspirations of so many hundreds of steam tables leaving their silent imprint behind like thousands of ghostly , childish hands  --  it 's enough to give any seasoned traveler a headache . Here , on a slushy December night , 150 Republicans have paid $1,000 each to celebrate the twentieth anniversary of their candidate 's marriage to Elizabeth " Liddy " Hanford , and to present official Washington 's second-most-powerful couple with a porcelain salad bowl  --  made in Massachusetts , of course  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checks made out to the Dole for President ' ' 96 campaign . Without this final and deciding piece of information it would be hard to say what , exactly , those gathered here have in common  --  the women with their brassy dyed-blonde hair , frozen in the high style of the Jayne Mansfield era , their husbands in ill-fitting sport coats and slacks that speak all too clearly of the colonial ranches with bedrooms over the garage that line the exit ramps of Route 9 , loading down their plates with jumbo shrimp and sea-smelling oysters and tangy horseradish sauce and bearing them away to the corners of the room . The broad-shouldered men and their wives do business with the liquor distributor Ray Tighe , or with Simon Fireman of Aqua-Leisure , the swimwear firm . They are here out of respect , and obligation , and opportunity  --  and to eat from the buffet . More puzzling is the commingling of these not-quite-suburban shopping-mall types with the younger men and women of the information age , in pinstriped suits and turtleneck sweaters . They have come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tennant 's New England Strategic Development Corporation , and from Bain Capital , the leveraged-buyout group , headed by Mitt Romney , the Mormon banker who nearly knocked off Ted Kennedy in the Senate race here in 1994 , and from the Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Corporation , which donated a cool $100,000 last year in " soft money " to Bob Dole 's Better America Foundation . They stand casually by the bar , with the well-modulated , rainy-day facial expressions , vague and bored , familiar from a generation of New Yorker cartoons . They , too , are here out of respect  --  for the majordomo of tonight 's event , Herb Collins , a jaunty Republican real estate developer whose Boston Capital , an empire that commands properties in forty-eight states and Puerto Rico , has been valued at over $3 billion and whose penchant for bow ties suggests a likeness to actor John Houseman or to former Watergate prosecutor Archibald Cox . Still , it is better to be here than out in the cold . At the door , every donor is presented with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white , and blue has been stapled , to be patriotically waved when the candidate enters . The buffet tables offer wedges of warm runny Brie that can be spread on toast , and Christmas sleighs sculpted from ice and loaded with shrimp and oysters , as well as serving platters of overripe melon . There is also an open bar , where , in a too-perfect information-age tableau , illustrating the headlong convergence of what might at first glance appear to be disparate fields of endeavor , a young LBO analyst from Bain stands with his pretty date , Jill , who writes jokes for David Letterman . He is explaining her job to one of his colleagues with an analogy to their own . " The head writer on the show is like the vice president in charge of the team , " he explains , " and Dave is like the client . The head writer 's job is to coordinate the work of Jill 's team in order to supply Dave with the product he needs . " The conversation ebbs and flows amid talk of insurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very little talk about politics . Steve Roche , a thirtyish pol who is in the business of raising money , as the Dole finance chair for Massachusetts and for State Treasurer Joe Malone , is the man who assembles he nuts and bolts of fundraising events across the state . A life spent around the fringes of hotel rooms like this one has lent his voice , a North End ethnic honk that would sound familiar coming from the rafters of the Boston Garden , some of the silky , confiding quality of a man who spends his days parting other , wealthier men from their money . In a former age , of course , Steve Roche would have been putting on rallies in Faneuil Hall , delivering winter coal to the precinct captains , or organizing torchlight parades for James Michael Curley . Tonight , however , he is more than happy to explain how the modern business of political fund-raising works . " They want to be able to get a letter from him , to get a tour of the White House , to go down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Roche offers . " I 'm not saying that the thirty million dollars that you raise is all raised through those people , " he adds . " I think a lot of it , too , is , you read down a list of people who are on the committee , and you 're a businessman , and you say , " That 's such a good group of people in that room . ' And they may even say to themselves , if not out loud to me , " Boy , I 've been trying to get a meeting with the third guy on that invitation  --  is he going to be there , Steve ? ' " Yeah , he is . " " That 's interesting . I certainly , A , like Bob Dole ; B , I 'm a Republican ; and C , I 'd love to be able to be in that room with that guy . ' And that is the peer reason . They need to be in that room , they 're a life insurance salesman , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy , and they say , " Hey , we have something else in common . ' That 's good business . " What is good business for insurance salesmen , liquor distributors , and all the others here tonight is also good business for Bob Dole . This week alone , at the Sheraton Hotel in Boston as well as in similarly anonymous rooms at the Bellevue in Philadelphia and the Hilton in Pittsburgh , the Senate majority leader will quietly raise over $1 million , a pace he has maintained throughout the fall . The money will buy television time in crucial primary stares and grease the wheels of the Dole political machine . It will pay the political consultants and pollsters , the Dole campaign staff on the ground in every primary state , the direct-mail experts , the professional telemarketers who solicit Republican voters over the phone , and raise more money to challenge President Clinton in the fall . If money has its uses on the ground , it also serves a more mystical , metaphysical purpose , surrounding the successful fund-raiser , like the Jedi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force field of credibility that renders him all but invulnerable to attack For political reporters , who will set the tone for television coverage of the campaign , the quarterly fund-raising reports of each candidate are proof , before a single vote is cast , or a single question or policy proposal is advanced in debate , of what reporters call the " viability " or " credibility " of the campaign . A window into the importance of fund-raising efforts in the collective unconscious of reporters can be gathered from a recent front-page article in the New York Times announcing that , in the third quarter of 1995 , Bob Dole had raised nearly three times as much money as his closest rivals , Pat Buchanan and Phil Gramm . " The third-quarter reports are significant , " the Times explained , for readers unfamiliar with what reporters like to call " the process , " " because they provide not only a picture of each candidate 's financial strength , but an indication of support among voters ... " On the face of it , the assertion would seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Bob Dole ?  --  yet it accurately mirrors the alarming extent to which money has become the deciding force in American elections . The tighter the primary season is squeezed , the less time candidates have to rise and fall according to their merits , the more money campaigns need up front , the more the early money buys . As the 1992 presidential primary proved , an anointed front-runner with enough early money can survive almost any embarrassment in the press or at the polls and emerge with his all-important media buys  --  and " credibility "  --  untouched . A recent example from our political history will suffice to illustrate some of the more far-reaching consequences of this point : The week before the New Hampshire primary , Bill Clinton  --  a young Arkansas governor dogged by allegations of pot smoking , draft dodging , and cheating on his wife  --  would receive a badly needed gift in a Sheraton Hotel room somewhat larger than this one from a coalition of investors who would pay the bills for the triumphant Clinton campaign that winter , spring , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New York Sheraton , the investor coalition behind Clinton was composed not of labor unions , urban developers , blacks , women , gays , and other " special interests "  --  once the party 's major sources of support and votes  --  but of investment bankers and entertainment-and computer-industry movers and shakers who shared an interest in global free trade , low interest rates , an end to Reagan-era military buildups , and reductions in the federal deficit . While some of these interests coincided with those of traditional liberals , they were , on balance , more allied with those of free-trade Republicans of the Jack Kemp school than with those of the party 's working-class constituents . One explanation for the coincidence of these interests is , of course , ideology : Hollywood is famously hospitable to liberals , and many computer executives and investment bankers were turned off by the rhetoric of Pat Buchanan and the Christian Coalition on issues like abortion . Yet it is also important to note that Hollywood studios  --  like the Manhattan investment banks and Silicon Valley computer companies that paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests in common : they depend on foreign markets for their goods , have enormous appetites for foreign capital , and employ small numbers of highly paid professionals . However much they differed from the Republican right on social issues , the new Democratic financiers also differed from many of the Democratic Party 's more traditional constituents on issues of social spending , taxation , and trade , the approaches to which will shape the country for decades to come . And so , a new Democratic Patty was born . The $750,000 Bill Clinton raised that February night at the Sheraton would keep his campaign running  --  and ensure its continued credibility  --  despite the candidate 's disappointing second-place showing three days later in New Hampshire . In the course of his troubled first year in office , President Clinton would implement NAFTA and GATT against the objections of a clear majority of his own party in Congress , and resist strong pressures to implement promised trade sanctions against China for its massive and continuing violations of human rights . That the economic program of the new Democratic financiers may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of little concern to those who pay the party 's bills today : with the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer at unprecedented speed , the first term of the Clinton presidency bears an alarming resemblance , in its effects if not in its tone , to that of Ronald Reagan . ( The investment banker who chaired the Sheraton dinner that February night , Robert Rubin of Goldman Sachs , now serves his country as secretary of the treasury . ) Some of the investors who will challenge the Clinton coalition this fall can be found tonight upstairs in the Dayton Room , a conference room on the third floor of the hotel , where Republican politicians and major Republican donors have gathered around a long table adorned , in a nod to the Puritan New England past , with a plain white tablecloth and pitchers of ice water . Awaiting the entrance of the candidate , Dole , they stand around the table and chat . There are places set for twenty people . You notice the politicians first : they carry themselves with the awareness that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one imagines , they would maintain even if the room were empty . Stephen Merrill , the auburn-haired governor of New Hampshire , shakes hands with a firm nice-to-see-you grip . Merrill 's endorsement of Bob Dole the day Colin Powell dropped out of the race all but guarantees the senator a first-place showing in New Hampshire . " How ya doing " Merrill says with a smile : his predecessor , John Sununu , rode his 1988 endorsement of George Bush to the White House . All but lost in Merrill 's glad approach and departure is Governor William Weld of Massachusetts , looking younger than his fifty years , thanks in part , he soon reveals , to his brand-new haircut . Weld 's preppie good looks are set off by a bullish neck that recalls the pre-television platform heroics of Teddy Roosevelt . Tonight , however , the governor is friendly but subdued : he is here to do penance for his ill-advised endorsement of Pete Wilson of California , whose campaign folded before a single vote was cast , in part because of his inability to tap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just engaged the governor in conversation : " Good to see you at the Builders Association dinner , " the developer remarks . " Glad to be there , " Weld replies , apologizing for an early departure . " I had six or seven other engagements . Besides , they served me a steak , and I was promised lobster . " " That 's too bad . " " I never miss a lobster , " the governor drawls . " I had to order myself the lobster dinner the next night at Locke-Ober 's . " William Weld , it must be said , is himself a wealthy man . Early in the morning , every fall and spring , at nearby Harvard College , for example , freshmen living in Weld Hall are ripped from their cozy beds by the ringing of alarm clocks , fumble with sweatshirts and sweatpants , and jog over to the Weld Boathouse by the banks of the Charles River , where they row crew Yet the governor 's assets , however significant by ordinary standards , pale in comparison with those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race , Senator John Forbes Kerry . While Kerry claims to be from the poor side of the Forbes family , his recent marriage to heiress Teresa Heinz gives him access to a personal fortune estimated to total over $750 million . Come 1996 , then , the governor will be needing all the help he can get from the developer as well as from Herb Collins , who surveys the room in the company of his wife , elegant and calm in the face of so many eager politicians . Next to Herb Collins stands Simon Fireman , chairman of Aqua-Leisure , impressive by virtue of his lush mane of hair , which resembles that of the Romantic pianist and composer Frederic Chopin . On the contributor lists made available by the Federal Election Commission can be found not only the expected $1,000 check from Simon Fireman but checks in the same amount from Barry Fireman , Harry Fireman , Lisa Fireman , Louise Fireman , and Norma Yost Fireman ; $1,000 checks from Aqua-Leisure employees Steven Berenson , Gayle Block , Walter Hand , James Hegarty , Paul Hoiriis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and checks from the statewide network of insurance companies , banks , suppliers , and contractors that do business with Aqua-Leisure , and whose contributions will be credited by Herb Collins to Fireman 's burgeoning account . Fireman and Dole go back a long way . As a director of the Export-Import Bank of the United States under Ronald Reagan , Simon Fireman discovered that " our export success was hampered by the fact that competitors in other nations were generously subsidized by their governments when seeking to secure export contracts . " The solution Fireman found  --  the creation of a $300 million " war chest " that would give taxpayer subsidies to companies like Aqua-Leisure  --  was sponsored by Senator Bob Dole . If the scene downstairs resembles an uncomfortable cocktail-hour cattle call for nickle-and-dime investors , then , the scene in the Dayton Room is like the meeting of a corporate board of directors , a gathering of well-fed men who move with the confidence born of their well-tailored suits , second and third vacation homes , and millions of dollars in the bank . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to measure vital signs and reflexes , to listen for signs of failing nerve , and then , barring unforeseen results , to offer aid and encouragement and enjoy their proximity to the man himself . Awaiting the arrival of the candidate , the room fills with the handicappers ' chatter , beloved by politicians and investors alike , of the opinion polls and commercials paid for by the men in this room , who smile and nod at the gathered politicians like visitors to the locker room of the athletes they watch on Sundays at Foxboro , where the New England Patriots play . It is nice to sit in some glassed-in owner 's box , listening to the mellow tones of the play-by-play man from the big-screen TV in the corner , safe from the December winds and rowdy , drunken fans , in a plush leather armchair while the hostess circumnavigates the room with her trays of hors d'oeuvres . Yet there is also a thrill that comes from the absence of cameras or an audience , from standing right up close to receive a scrap or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to play on artificial turf , where knees twist and tendons snap , where 300-pound steroid monsters come bearing down  --  yes , there 's a thrill hat comes from feeling like a part of the action . As Dole enters the room , shaking hands , the men introduce themselves one by one . Equipped with the politician 's elephantine memory , Dole recalls many of their names . And if Dole tends to vanish in front of big crowds , if he can look all of his seventy-two years and grumpy on television , it must be said that he is at his best with small groups of contributors , with whom he can summon up the sensation that they are men in shirtsleeves speaking plainly around some mythic kitchen table . With a leaderly nod , a sign of interest containing also a promise of money from the swollen reserves he commands , Dole surveys the politicians about their prospects and absolves Bill Weld of his sins  --  for now , at least  --  with a casual nod of support ( " We need more Republicans in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casually allows that he expects to have the Republican nomination wrapped up by the end of March . It is a prediction that might surprise many voters  --  is n't the Republican convention in August ?  --  but whose accuracy is obvious from even a cursory glance at the Republican primary schedule . The worry among his political advisers now , Dole confides , is House Speaker Newt Gingrich : every time Gingrich appears on television , the senator 's poll numbers go down . The strategy for the rest of the winter will be to keep the House Speaker off television  --  leave the budget talk to John Kasich , head of the House Budget Committee  --  and avoid joint appearances whenever possible . The coalition gathering this winter behind Bob Dole , in hotel rooms like this across the country , is different in small but meaningful ways from the one that would have gathered a decade ago in support of Ronald Reagan . It includes those who will benefit from a promised cut in the capital gains tax  --  real estate men like Herb Collins , Wall Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil and gas interests , led by Lod Cook of ARCO and Philip Anschutz of Denver , Colorado , who look with envy as well to the natural wealth stockpiled on federal lands . It includes unreconstructed corporate raiders like T. Boone Pickens and Henry Kravis , who are looking for breaks from the SEC , and more sober Wall Street types , who believe that Dole  --  unlike Clinton  --  can be trusted to fully implement whatever budget agreement is finally arrived at in Congress . " Dole would be stable , " explains Max Fisher , the legendary Detroit investor , supporter of Israel , and honorary chairman of the Dole campaign 's National Finance Committee . " Clinton has a tendency to flip-flop a great deal . He changes his position on the issues . Dole will be more stable , more moderate , and approach this thing on a more balanced basis , if you understand what I mean . " The Dole coalition also includes low-wage manufacturing and retail interests whose profits depend on the loosening of labor laws and tax burdens at home . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investment banking , high tech , and entertainment  --  Dole looks increasingly like the candidate of low-wage , labor-intensive retail , manufacturing , and small business , inclined to champion the protectionist interests of his investors . It is also possible , of course , to draw more direct connections between Bob Dole and the interests of the major investors in his campaign for the presidency . The Gulf Stream jets that speed the Senate majority leader from his apartment in the Watergate complex in Washington to New Hampshire , or to fund-raising events across the country , are owned by Cincinnati financier Carl Lindner , once a close associate of convicted savings-and-loan felon Charles Keating . In recent months , Dole has repaid his corporate sponsor by standing on the Senate floor and demanding that the United States impose sanctions on Colombia and Costa Rica if those Latin American nations fail to pull out of a recently concluded banana export deal with the European Union . If , according to one Administration official , " this is a case where no one can explain how we are saving a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  controlled by Carl Lindner  --  stands to lose a great deal . Meanwhile , proud citizens of the two Latin American nations , once referred to in the United States as " banana republics , " can be forgiven for wondering if that famously insulting term , with its implications of politicians being bought and sold on the open market , might not be better applied to their neighbor to the north . And if Dole campaign workers in Iowa need trucks , to move office equipment and telephone banks after they are done , they will no doubt call upon the corporate interests of John Ruan , a longtime Dole supporter and national vice-chairman of the Dole for President ' ' 96 campaign . It will not be hard to find him : Ruan runs his network of trucking , leasing , real estate , insurance , and banking companies from the top of the thirty-six-story Ruan Tower in Des Moines , the tallest building in Iowa . Why is John Ruan supporting Bob Dole ? Connoisseurs of the legislative arts are unlikely to forget a memorable piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles Grassley of Iowa , and rejected four times by their colleagues , before it was successfully attached to a bill to privatize ConRail . The Dole amendment is notable both for its brevity and for the rather exclusive nature of its provisions : " The amendments made by section 201 of the IRS code shall not apply to trucks , tractor units , and trailers which a privately held truck leasing company headquartered in Des Moines , Iowa contracted to purchase in September , 1985 . " In other words , the U.S. tax code should not apply to the corporate interests of one man , John Ruan , at an estimated cost to his fellow taxpayers of $8.5 million . For Ruan , however , the Dole-Grassley Amendment was a bargain of Manhattan island proportions . Between 1982 and 1987  --  according to the Federal Election Commission  --  Ruan gave $8,450 to Senator Dole and his various campaign vehicles . Looked upon as an investment , then , Ruan 's contributions to Dole can be seen to have returned a quite remarkable 100,492 percent on capital , or many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as stocks , bonds , and mutual funds. * Whatever your perspective , Bob Dole 's legislative prowess makes one thing clear : win or lose , Dole for President ' ' 96 is a very good investment . Downstairs in the Sheraton 's Independence Room , fueled by the open bar and the aphrodisiac plates of oysters , the assembled donors eagerly await the appearance of Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole , " masterfully running the U.S. Senate , " as Lieutenant Governor Paul Cellucci explains , while campaigning across the country for American families " struggling every month to pay their bills to support their children . " Next is State Treasurer Joe Malone . " The American people understand that what made this country great is the idea that , yes , we deliver services , " says Malone , " but then you let people go out and have the individual freedom , so they can work , and sacrifice , and achieve the American dream they set out for themselves . " So it is sad to relate that the Bob Dole who appears tonight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the same Bob Dole that millions of television viewers have seen a hundred times before , sinking inexorably deeper into his opening repertoire of warmed-over Strom Thurmond jokes ( at ninety-three , Thurmond is one of the few senators older than Dole ) . The opening monologue over , Dole turns to introduce his Senate colleague , Larry Pressler of South Dakota . As the contributors look gladly toward the two men , Dole wastes little time getting right to the point . " I want to thank Senator Pressler for coming in , " he says , a ghost of the familiar Bob Dole smirk , sardonic and knowing , tugging impatiently at the comers of his mouth . " I want to say just one word about Senator Pressler . He 's running for reelection in ' ' 96  --  he takes money , " Dole says , punching home the word as the audience laughs . " He takes checks . " They laugh again . " It 's legal in South Dakota to take money out of Massachusetts . Well , let me tell you something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone in the audience is too dim or too wet behind the ears to understand why the grinning senator from South Dakota has traveled through a blizzard to eat oysters in a Massachusetts hotel room . " There are probably a lot of people here interested in the telecommunications bill  --  it 's the best thing that we 've done all year as far as the future 's concerned in technology and jobs , " says Dole . And whatever the truth of that description  --  analysts argue that the telecom bill will cost consumers billions in higher fees for the monopolistic cable and telephone service it will provide  --  it is a fact that plenty of people in high-tech Boston are interested in telecommunications : to date , the concerned parties nationwide have invested nearly $40 million to influence the final shape of telecom legislation . " And the chairman of that committee , " Dole explains , as around the room ears perk up , " and the one leading the effort right now on a day-to-day basis , has been Senator Larry Pressler from South Dakota . Larry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bang , the auctioneer 's gavel coming down one last time  --  Senator Larry Pressler Sold to the man with the whales on his tie . Of course , if you attend enough events like this one , as many Washington insiders inevitably must , there is something appealingly adult about Dole 's performance . As he smirks and blinks , and tramples on his applause lines , it is not hard to imagine some kind of fundamental honesty that prevents him from pulling out all the stops and putting on the expected show . Dole 's best lines , his best moments in the Senate , have in common a weary and knowing respect for his audience . The very depth of Dole 's cynicism can even translate as charm : " I 'm not going to lie to you " is one of the few lines that the senator delivers with any conviction in public , not because Dole does n't lie but because , unlike so many politicians , he is at least aware that he is lying . The rapid blink of his eyes , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is as if his entire body were apologizing in advance for what will follow . " What do you expect ? "  --  he blinks in telegraphic code  --  " they told me to read this if I want to be president . " And , it must be said , Dole understands how the system works and why , and that alone might be enough to make him a good president . Where Dole falls terribly short , however , is in his attempts to do what presidents have long been expected to do  --  to use words and ideas to lead and inspire . " I want to thank you very much for coming , thank you for all your help , and we 'll be back many , many times , " he promises , reaching out for some fine phrase , some lofty vision that might wrap the entire evening in a warm glow and accompany the donors , great and small , out into the snow and the cold of the Boston winter . " I want us to become the majority party for " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons . " He pauses again to gather his thoughts . " First , we had a vision for America , we had ideas , an agenda , we knew precisely where we wanted to go as a nation . That 's what leadership to me is all about . And that 's the direction we wish to go . " It is like watching a man trying to catch the sun with a buttefly net . " And I 'm not afraid to lead , " he continues , his voice rising in the harsh Midwestern twang that speaks of sunbaked prairies and falling wheat prices and the farmers who came empty-handed to the store owned by his father , Doran Dole , in Russell , Kansas , to rail against the Eastern banks and big corporations . " I 'm not afraid to take the heat . I 'm not afraid to make the right , tough decisions . " There are only a few moments to go now , only a small space left in the night to be filled with the one magical phrase that will send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , and the LBO analysts in their pinstriped suits out into the cold with the feeling that in addition to doing the necessary favor for Ray Tighe , or Simon Firestone , or Herb Collins , they have also done good . " I 'm not going to take you over the edge , " Dole promises . " I 'm not a polarizer . " Instead of uplift , he is answering a host of invisible critics from his previous races  --  1976 , 1980 , 1988  --  who said that Bob Dole lacked vision , that he was a Goldwater nut , a hater . He will answer them all , right here , tonight , " I reach out to people , " Dole concludes , having beaten his ghosts away from the podium . " We need that in the Republican Party . So thank you very much , and we 'll turn it back to Joe . " And as Dole steps from the stage and circles the room , shaking hands and posing for pictures , what lingers behind him is the same glittery-eyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that washes over every good politician the moment the cameras click on , but which , in its most naked forms , is likely to frighten voters away and to scare the daylights out of their children , who think that the man on TV is about to leap off the screen into their living rooms , take their allowance , and twist their arms . The program with the public Bob Dole , of course , is that he is a product of the much larger and more serious process by which a political system driven by corporate money has been severed from the moorings of ideas and public organizations . Instead of addressing the hopes and fears of the majority of voters , Democrats and Republicans now routinely engage in Orwellian double-talk about taxes , the deficit , and trade intended for two different audiences at once : the undifferentiated masses of voters who respond to the weekly polls , and the corporate donors who pay for the system to do their work . In a rational political system , of course , geared to show off the strengths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the land , Bob Dole would be allowed to go on television and explain to the voters who is supporting him ( and why ) , who is supporting Bill Clinton ( and why ) , and encourage the voters to choose between them based on this practical knowledge . And why not ? Why not level with the American people and explain that fund-raisers sponsored by men who do business with the government amount to little more than officially sanctioned bribes , and that $100,000 donations to " leadership PACs " and other political organs are fees to the parties for services rendered ? As Bob Dole completes his final circuit of the room at the Sheraton , posing for pictures with his arms around the bankers , the insurance salesmen , the liquor distributors , and all the others who have ventured out into the wind and slush of the Boston winter , reaching out with his good left arm to shake their hands and avoid the awkward jiving dance that so often accompanies these unplanned moments , as supporters reach instead for his right , the hand that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is impossible to avoid a passing moment of sympathy for this grim and driven figure . However many times Bob Dole has sold his vote in the Senate , so many thousands of times that he can not possibly remember them all , he has never really sold himself . How could he ? He believes in nothing . After almost five terms in the Senate , after two stints as majority leader , Dole alone among the prominent senators of the century will have left no body of legislation of significant benefit to the public at large . Instead , he has performed what may yet be seen as a more valuable service , that of embodying the qualities of the age to which he was heir , of transforming himself , through dint of hard work and determination , into the perfect representative of a generation of politicians who sold themselves like aging hookers on a blowout weekend in Las Vegas . " Nice to meet you , " says the candidate as I politely step up to have my picture taken . I almost feel bad  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward and , with the unfathomable and perfect logic that happens often in dreams but seldom in life , from the vicinity of the melting ice sleigh still pulling its load of jumbo shrimp , six smiling and telegenically gorgeous young Republican volunteers ? escorts ? someone 's daughters ? in prom-queen dresses step forward to join the candidate and his wife in the frame . " This is n't so bad , " says Dole , motioning to me to come join them , and as I do it occurs to me that this is how an American political campaign is supposed to look  --  the proud candidate , his wife , the pretty girls  --  and it feels nice to return , if only for a moment , to the familiar world of illusion The candidate smiles , and winks , and puts his arm around his wife . They are standing together in the one hundredth hotel room of the primary season that tonight is nearing its unheralded close , and from which Bob Dole has emerged as the world-heavyweight champion fund-raiser on the Republican planet .
