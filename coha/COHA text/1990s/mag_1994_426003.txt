GIULIANI AND WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN . <p> When New York City Republican Mayor Rudolph Giuliani crossed party lines to endorse Governor Mario Cuomo on October 24 , he romanced panicky liberal Democrats into denial both about Cuomo 's senescence and about the disaffection of moderate Democrats . But when State Senator George Pataki beat Cuomo 49 percent to 45 percent on Election Day , finishing off not only Cuomo but also Giuliani 's clout with the GOP , the question was obvious : Why had n't Giuliani simply thrown his arm around Pataki , who had more in common with him politically than do either the grandiloquent Cuomo or the fresh crop of wild-eyed congressional Newtoids ? Had Giuliani backed Pataki , he 'd have won by even more . The mayor and the city would be sitting pretty instead of ducking Republican wrath . A centrist " reinvention " of the New York welfare state would have much brighter prospects than it has had since the 1970s . <p> Yet Giuliani had n't merely endorsed Cuomo ; he 'd responded to the Republican outrage over his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behalf . Giuliani depicted Pataki , a mild-mannered Yalie and Columbia Law School graduate , almost as if he were one of the Wall Street or Mafia deal-makers he 'd bagged as U.S. Attorney during the 1980s . <p> One reason for this venom , supporters confided , was that Giuliani wanted to ruin Pataki 's campaign patron and his own political nemesis , Senator Alfonse D'Amato . Yet Giuliani 's battle with D'Amato raised as many questions about his motives as it seemed to answer . As the Daily News 's Michael Goodwin noted , Giuliani had n't always opposed " Senator Shakedown " ; as U.S. Attorney , he 'd boosted D'Amato 's 1986 re-election by joining him at a media-heavy police drug buy in Harlem . In 1992 he 'd endorsed D'Amato again , even though they were by then estranged . ( Giuliani had prosecuted some of the senator 's cronies and D'Amato had put up billionaire Ronald Lauder against him in the 1989 Republican mayoral primary . ) <p> Another good reason  --  the one Giuliani offered the public  --  was that Pataki 's vow to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city was already cutting and force Giuliani to raise local property taxes . Pataki countered that Giuliani and Cuomo had struck a deal for more state aid . Others suggested that Giuliani had simply converted to Cuomoism : " If a conservative is a liberal who 's been mugged , " shrugged one wag , " a liberal is a conservative who 's been elected mayor of New York . " Most likely , Giuliani was investing in his own electoral stock as a dragon-slayer above partisan politics . <p> At first , the endorsement seemed to pay off . Cuomo surged ahead in the polls . The New York Times had a five-page news and editorial orgasm over Giuliani , whom it had dismissed as a " Wonder Bread Son of the ' 50s " and apostle of " civic Reaganism , " but now heralded as a transpartisan hero who " stands very tall " in " the mold of Fiorello LaGuardia . " The afterglow lasted for days , lulling liberals into the abyss that swallowed both Cuomo 's welfare-state politics and Giuliani 's transpartisan promise ( which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nod to Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein days after ) . <p> Still , discerning New Yorkers had reason to worry about Giuliani 's crusade against Pataki . Among upstate and suburban voters  --  who outnumber city voters  --  the end had come for Cuomo . In bipartisan concert with a tax-and-spend legislature , he 'd made New York exhibit a for conservative Republicans : a job-hemorrhaging welfare state whose public sector employs proportionately more people than any other state 's , and whose " business health " ranks forty-eighth in the nation on the seven major indices of a recent U.S. News &; World Report survey . The state 's debt structure is based on junk-bond financing and a soaring deficit that , Cuomo now warns , may be $4 billion . <p> On Election Day , the New York City turnout was swamped by that of economically stressed upstate and suburban voters . Giuliani had misread the statewide mood in part because the Times , complacent about a Cuomo victory , proved more adept at gauging the mood in Port-au-Prince than in Syracuse or Suffolk County . Cuomo misread the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lombardi noted in October , Cuomo really had run for " governor of New York City , " organizing his campaign explicitly and exhaustively to turn out urban black , Hispanic , gay and female supporters  --  a fatal miscalculation . " There 's much less optimism upstate about the future than there is in the city , " says Representative Charles Schumer , a Brooklyn Democrat . " You have to see the empty factories in Buffalo , the laid-off workers on welfare for the first time in their lives . They 're desperate and struggling . " <p> Cuomo had styled himself the all-provident paterfamilias of what he calls " The Family of New York . " But the rallying , leafleting and phone-banking by unions and Democratic county organizations failed to relieve the torpor into which Cuomo 's intended beneficiaries had sunk . As Nicholas Von Hoffman wrote in The Washington Post  --  after watching the election in Brooklyn  --  Democrats have forgotten how to organize those they call " the entitled and the challenged , ' the people who never speak and are ceaselessly spoken about .... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's have no organizational web to stay in touch with this quasi-constituency of theirs . " The Democrats instead rely on surveys and on welfare and human rights lobbyists . <p> None of which kept New York Times reporter Todd Purdum from citing a survey to assure readers that Pataki 's slogan about Cuomo  --  " Too liberal for too long "  --  was only half right , since the poll 's respondents bemoaned Cuomo 's longevity more than his liberalism . He did n't explain why the less liberal Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan , in office far longer than Cuomo , proved impregnable to a challenger no more or less well known than Pataki . <p> Voters have tired of Cuomo Democrats for two reasons . First , liberal Democrats , no less than their conservative Democratic and Republican colleagues , practice a decrepit " crony capitalism " by arranging publicly funded boondoggles for big campaign contributors . Second , they try to cover their sins by catering to " the human rights and welfare industry lobbyists , " as Von Hoffman put it , who think people are liberated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in color , surname or sexual orientation . <p> Few Americans actually believe that , and few multicultural differences contribute anything to a vibrant civic culture or progressive politics . The race-class-gender trinity actually thwarts class politics by distracting people from their common interests . That distraction benefits corporate managers , foundation liberals , lobbyists for the social-welfare industries and the trendies who edit glossy magazines for " market niche " audiences identified by focus groups . But on November 8 , moderate as well as conservative voters revolted against this system . <p> Newspapers such as the Times misunderstood the implications of all this during the campaign because they , like Cuomo , had come to embrace and embody the multicultural agenda in their own realms . Nowhere was that more evident in the campaign than on the editorial and op-ed pages , where , in the final week before the election , columnists Frank Rich and Anna Quindlen were preoccupied with a book on the Clarence Thomas hearings that , Rich predicted , would " make people 's blood boil . " It was more important to them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was boiling upstate . After it boiled over on Election Day , Quindlen wrote Cuomo an elegy . A Times profile of Pataki adapted the old Giuliani " Wonder Bread " metaphor to the governor-elect , dubbing him " Mr. Plain Vanilla . " <p> Had Wonder Bread given Plain Vanilla at least a pro forma endorsement , his beleaguered city would now face the prospect of partisan preferment rather than punishment from Albany and Washington . The city would be able to hope for a $100 million economic boost from the 1996 Republican National Convention and a gravy train from new Senate Banking Committee Chairman D'Amato . Far more important would be the hope that a vigorous , brainy Giuliani-Pataki team could reinvent New York 's city and state governments , now locked together in a fiscal free-fall . The only way to stop that free-fall is to reconfigure both of these interdependent colossi at the same time , changing what they do and deliver . That will take cooperation between the mayor and the governor that transcends both partisanship and ideology . <p> If Democrats still represented a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be fit for the task . Instead , in thrall to Cuomo 's and the Times 's vague notions , they 've defaulted to state Republicans , who may not be up to the task at all . Giuliani and Pataki do have the ability , but the vengeful D'Amato looms large : three days after the election , Pataki had yet to return one of Giuliani 's several congratulatory , conciliatory calls . When they do finally meet on the political terrain , ravaged as much by liberal myopia as by right-wing rage , New York 's Republican mayor and Republican governor will probably look at each other and ask , " Now what ?
