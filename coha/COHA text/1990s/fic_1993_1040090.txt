 | was mainly intended for children , but Sarah took books out there too , in order to learn stories to tell to Yiftach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third grade , his little brother was born . They called him Danny , but he did n't react when they spoke to him . His face was blank , and when they passed their hands before his eyes he did n't blink . He cried without making a sound , and no noise woke him . He grew fat , kept his hands stretched out in front of him , but only his body grew . Yiftach read stories about pirates and witches , and his mother traveled to doctors . The truth was that they had already told her in the hospital that it was hopeless , and recommended leaving the baby in a home for retarded children , but Sarah refused , and she took him home . She would take him , too , for walks in the street , covering the white pram , which had belonged to Yiftach when he was a baby , with a fine net to protect him from the mosquitoes , and from the prying eyes . He never learned to sit , but when he was one year old he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in his playpen , and sometimes , nobody knew how , he would get out of the playpen and crawl along the walls , scratching the paint with his fingernails . At first Sarah would follow in his footsteps , repainting the walls in soft pastel shades , with the same perseverance as she went on looking after her flowers . But as the baby 's body grew , and as his reactions became more and more incomprehensible , she left the scratches made by  | his fingernails on the walls , and she stopped taking care of the garden too . Simcha , who could not bear the sight of the neglected , wilting flowers , would get up early on Saturday mornings and do his best to keep the yard in shape . But the baby 's condition depressed him too . " It 's a pity I sold the Volvo , " he said one morning , and he stopped getting up to water the flowers . He went on working in the shop from morning to night , and during the holidays he would sometimes take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the chrysanthemums grew wild , stopped flowering and spread to the fence , mingling with the thorns and weeds which shot up between the tender seedlings of grass , seedlings which never joined up into a lawn , and without a hand to guide them the wild things overran the yard , the fence , and the walls . Yiftach would sit in the kitchen and do his homework . He would go to the grocer 's and watch the food cooking on the stove . When he walked down the street with his hair combed and his shoulders stooped , a basket full of groceries in his hand , Tzemach 's mother would say : " Just look at that little man . " And after a short pause , she would repeat a remark which from time to time escaped the lips of others too : " When they dished out good luck that woman was at the end of the line . " Sarah and Simcha stopped going to the cinema , but on the rare occasions when they did go out , Yiftach would lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came home . He would read the picture books he took out of  | Zvi Kessler 's library , and if he had n't fallen asleep by the time all the pages were turned , he would begin again from the beginning . Sarah stopped talking again . She restricted herself to essential words , and in Tabak 's grocery store she would point to the things she wanted to buy , and never check the bill . After supper at Hagar Erlich 's Yiftach did not go home . He reached the gate , and when he saw that his house was dark , he went to the lot . There was nobody there yet . He sat on the stone and waited . He saw Tuvia 's jeep sending long beams into the street , and then he saw the light go on in the bathroom . Yiftach watched the lights going on and off in Hagar and Tuvia 's house until they went out altogether , and then he stood up and approached the fence surrounding the dark house . Although Hagar had forgotten to shut the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driven the jeep was unlocked too , he decided to go in through the fence . He lifted the branches of the vine clinging to the barbed wire , and , like a fox , crawled under the bottom strand into the yard . The heat of the day was still heavy among the fruit trees , and when he passed under the boughs of the tan-  | gerine a cloud of mosquitoes moved with him and his skin itched . In the shelter of the trees he paused . Between them and the veranda lay a stretch of open ground , with the clear light of the full moon shining on it . Voices echoed in the street . It seemed to him that Tuvia and Hagar were returning , or maybe someone was coming to visit them . But the moon sailing through the sky moved away , a shadow fell over the stretch of open ground , and Yiftach ran to the veranda and stopped next to the steps . All around him it was quiet . The howling of the jackals had not yet begun in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps and the wall . After a while he took off his sandals , and holding them in his hand he climbed the steps to the veranda . He went up to the tall , narrow cupboard built into the corner of the wall , looked around him , and tried to open the door . The door was locked . His feet were cold . He went down the steps and stretched his hand up to the windowsill . His hand touched the cold marble , but his fingers did not reach the place under the can where he knew the keys were kept . With his hand raised he jumped up . The first time he did n't even touch the can . The second time he knocked it over . The can fell to the ground , hit a pail , and vanished in the darkness . It seemed to him that the keys had fallen too . He bent down , put his sandals on the ground , and began groping in the sand . His fingers encountered a few sharp stones , dry leaves and bits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rustle in the trees . A jackal or cat raced past . He stood still .  | The animal came up against the fence , and in its struggle to break out , it shook the dry branches which made a whistling , whispering sound . He turned the pail over and climbed onto it . Now he reached the window sill easily . After a brief , groping search , his fingers encountered the key ring . There were only two keys on it one , long and thick , the key to the house , and the second , shorter one , the key to the veranda cupboard . Leaving his sandals next to the overturned pail he climbed the cold veranda steps again . Everything was silent , and when he pushed the key into the keyhole it made a faint noise which rooted him to the spot . He pressed against the door and slowly turned the key . The long , narrow door opened . The veranda was dark , and inside the cupboard , which was set deep into the wall , he at first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managed to make out a few shelves at the bottom . He knelt down and began to rummage . He felt smooth cans of shoe polish , rough brushes , newspapers , a few baskets , and a cardboard box full of clothespins . He raised his hands to the second shelf . Two empty metal pots sent a cold current through the tips of his fingers . His hands tangled with slack coils of rope and string . His knees hurt . He stood up and leaned against the wall . Then he bent down again , supporting himself with one hand on the wall , while the other searched . The third shelf was full of newspapers , and among them , in the corner , his fingers encountered the thin chain which attached the cork to the canteen .  | When he pulled it toward him , a few newspapers were dislodged and fell onto the floor . He picked them up , put them back on the shelf , closed the door and locked it . Then he climbed down the steps and returned to the upended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back on the windowsill . While he was putting on his sandals he suddenly remembered that he had forgotten to replace the can which had covered the keys . He found it easily , lying on the sand between two dry , thorny branches . He put it on the windowsill , on top of the keys , turned the pail over , and got ready to leave . He intended going out by the big side gate through which Tuvia always drove the jeep into the yard . But even when he was standing in the shadow of the jeep the aluminum of the uncovered canteen glittered in his hand , and he turned on his heel and retraced his steps . This time he avoided going past the veranda and went straight into the trees . He listened to the noise of his footsteps and his body brushing against the branches , and made for the fence . Without trying to locate the exact spot where he had entered the yard , he thrust the supports propping up the vines aside , threw the canteen through the fence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirt , and when he pulled it free , it tore . His father had not yet come home , and Yiftach went into the shed and filled the canteen with water . He took a few sips , and filled it up again . There was a stifling smell in the shed , and he washed his face , dried it on his shirt and went outside . When he had gone a few paces in the dew-drenched grass , he heard muffled footsteps in the  | road . His father opened the gate and Yiftach retreated , walked around the shed , and hid behind it , among the piles of old crates and planks which he used to feed the fire under the boiling laundry . He listened attentively to his father 's footsteps . He heard him stop outside the door and rummage in his tool bag for the key . A weak beam of light flooded the yard as the door creaked open . From the shadows in which he was hiding the yard looked pale , like the night . In the kitchen and hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see his father 's silhouette . He walked slowly along the clotheslines , circled the house , and stole out the gate into the street . The lights of a tractor driving past dazzled him . He pushed the canteen inside his torn shirt . Under the shirt his skin was bare , and a shiver of cold ran down his belly . But then the warmth of his body overcame the chill of the aluminum and apart from its heavy jolting he hardly felt the canteen . He made for the spreading shadow of the eucalyptus tree . He sat down on the stone in the corner of the lot , put the canteen behind it , and waited for the children . There were six of them , including him . And when they arrived , they all headed for the school . Between the school and the cemetery was a plowed field , with the remains of an old army training ground still standing between its furrows . There were tall poles , bars for balancing , a framed net , and rope ladders . The furrows were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth . The race to the rope ladder was won by Tzemach ,  | who was the oldest . The rest of them stumbled behind him , between the furrows , but Yiftach did n't come last . The canteen was hidden under his shirt again , but nobody had yet noticed his bulging stomach . As he ran his shirttails escaped from his trousers , but he caught the canteen before it fell . When he reached the rope ladder , the canteen was safely tucked into his shirt again . Tzemach held onto the rope ladder with both hands and panted for breath . When the last boy arrived , Tzemach began to climb . The ropes swayed , and since they were not clearly visible , Tzemach seemed to be floating in the air . He climbed down and they went up after him . Yiftach remained standing to one side . He opened the canteen and began to drink from it . " Why do n't you go up ? " asked Tzemach . " I 'm thirsty , " said Yiftach and took a sip of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked Yoram . " A canteen , " said Yiftach , " ca n't you see ? " " His mother must have given it to him . A toy canteen , made of rubber . " " I got it for myself , " said Yiftach . " It 's tin . A soldier 's canteen . " " You 've got a big imagination , " Tzemach sneered . " You can touch it if you do n't believe me . " Tzemach stayed where he was . But Yoram said : " Give us a sip . " " In a minute . " Yiftach took another sip and closed the canteen . Then he hooked his little finger round the chain attached to the cork , and offered the canteen to Yoram . " It 's heavy , " said Yoram.  | " I 've already drunk half of it , " said Yiftach , " so imagine how much it weighs when it 's full . " Yoram lifted the canteen to his lips to drink . But Tzemach took a step toward him and pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water spilled out and soaked into the earth . Yiftach went up to it and picked it up . It was smeared with mud . He cleaned it with his shirt and then he held it by the cork . The canteen hung next to his thigh . " Look at him , " said Yoram . " He 's envious . " " Go home to your mommy , " said Tzemach . " She has to check your homework . " Yiftach did not reply . He went up to the rope ladder , sat on the second rung , and swung to and fro . " What do you want of him ? " asked Yoram . " You shut your mouth . Sucking up to everybody . It 's not a soldiers ' canteen . " " It is a soldiers ' canteen , " said Yiftach . " A certain sol-dier 's . " He got off the ladder . " Tomorrow I 'm going to give it back to him . I 've got a date to meet him . " Tzemach laughed . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . Yiftach too took a step forward . Tzemach bent down and picked up a small clod of earth . " No stones , " someone shouted . But Tzemach did n't have time to hear the shout . Yiftach sprang on him , hit him with his fists , and ran away , far into the plowed field . They ran after him . He could hear their cries and stumbles . He too tripped several times , but he did n't stop  | running . His feet drew him in the direction of the cemewry . But when he reached the gravedigger 's hut he was brought up short by fear , and he began retracing his ' . tops . Their voices were close . He lay down on the field , dug himself in between two ridges of earth , and curled into a ball . They were all around him , scattered over the ground , calling loudly to each other . Yiftach shrank , he lay still and tried not to breathe . " He must have gone into the cemetery , " someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tzemach . They searched , and he lay on the ground , shrinking and dirty . From his hiding place he could see their shadows moving . The moon made them long and tall . He himself had no shadow . It was already late and he had to go home . But the children went on roaming around the field . When they were tired of searching , Tzemach said : " Do n't worry . He 'll have to go back to his mother . We 'll catch him tomorrow . " They returned to the rope ladder , and after a while moved on to the school playground , walking in a close group . Yiftach followed them . When he heard them leaving the playground and saw their figures in the light shining over the gate , he went into the grounds and headed for the taps . He cleaned the canteen , washed his face and drank water . He took a roundabout way home . In most of the  | houses the lights were already off , and the streets were deserted . He walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pile of gravel outside their house . He climbed it and saw his father 's head , bent over a newspaper , through the lighted window . His mother was not yet back . There was a light on in Hagar and Tuvia Erlich 's house . The lot was empty , with only the moon sailing over it . He ran to the shade of the eucalyptus , sat down on the stone , and looked at Hagar 's house . He was waiting for the light to go off . But before it did , he saw his mother passing underneath the streetlights . She was carrying his baby brother in her arms . She opened the gate and went into the house . He waited a few minutes longer and suddenly he felt terribly thirsty . Although the canteen was empty , he raised it to his lips , hoping that a few drops would fall into his mouth . He licked his lips and as he put the canteen back into his shirt , the light went off in Hagar 's house . He stood up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and continued crawling on all fours between the trees . When he drew close to the bedroom window he heard them talking . He took off his sandals and approached the veranda with quiet steps . " I have n't got a key , " he suddenly said to himself . But he climbed the steps nevertheless and went up to the cupboard door . He bumped into Tuvia 's work boots , which were standing on top of the balustrade , and the scraping of the nails on the stone made him cling to the  | wall . Tuvia and Hagar stopped talking . Yiftach stood quite still . When he thought that they had fallen asleep he tiptoed up to the cupboard . The door was locked . A cold sweat bathed his forehead and the fingers of his hands holding his sandals . Next to the cupboard was an empty wicker basket . He lifted the paper lining the bottom of the basket , laid the canteen in the basket , and covered it with the paper . His eyes grew accustomed to the darkness , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veranda . A little bench , a crate of plums , a shovel . And then , with a swift , sharp movement , he bent down and took the canteen out of the basket . He tucked it into his shirt and climbed down the veranda steps . Next to the jeep he stopped to put on his sandals , and then he went home . He hid the canteen behind the shed , under an overturned box . Before going inside he knocked on the door . " Where have you been ? " asked his mother . " At Hagar 's . " " Until now ? " " Yes . I saw you were n't back yet . " " But I was back , " said his father . " And how did you get so dirty ? " asked his mother , staring at his torn shirt . " I played with the kids in the afternoon . " She cut him a slice of cake and made him a cup of tea . When he came back clean from the shower , she asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She 's stopped giving us any . The holidays start next week . " " But you should go over your lessons . Even if I have n't got the time to sit with you . " She turned to his father . " I 'm taking the baby to the hospital again tomorrow morning . Maybe they 'll keep him there . I do n't know . Something has to be done . " Yiftach went to bed . Sarah went into the kitchen , prepared a salad for breakfast , and put it in the refrigerator . The next morning he woke early . Sarah took care of the baby , Simcha sliced the bread , and Yiftach fried the omelets . " What time does school finish ? " asked his father . " Twelve o'clock . " " Come to the shop . We 'll go and have lunch together . " He stroked Yiftach 's head . " And then we 'll go and get our hair cut . " " Okay , " said Yiftach . But when he went out of the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around to the back of the shed , put the canteen into his satchel , and then crossed the street to Hagar Erlich 's house . Moving cautiously , he approached the veranda and climbed the steps . The cupboard door was open . The boot brush and can of polish were standing on the balustrade . The can was open . He pushed the canteen into the cupboard and was covering it with newspapers when the kitchen door opened and Hagar Erlich came out onto the veranda . " Yiftach , " she exclaimed , " what are you doing here ? " " My mother had to go out today too , " he said , " and  | she asked if you could take me for a walk this after-noon . " In the morning , Hagar boiled up a pot of Turkish coffee and put it in the refrigerator . And at midday , after she had finished cooking , she packed the meal she had prepared for her husband into the wicker basket and took the bus to the garage . Tuvia was sitting on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His blue overalls were covered with grease stains . Yoel was wearing khaki , and his overalls were lying next to him . They were talking . " See you later , " said Yoel , picked up his overalls , and turned to go . He went over to the office , threw the overalls onto a rough black tire lying next to the door , and when he turned his head he saw Hagar . " What are you doing here ? " he asked . " Nothing , " she said . " I came to see you and Tuvia . " She was wearing a green skirt scattered with red flowers , and a thin , yellow sleeveless blouse . The wicker basket in her hand brushed her white knees .  | Tuvia overheard their conversation . He got off the fender , put the wrench in his hand on the concrete floor of the garage , and walked over to his wife . He kissed her without touching her with his hands . " My hands are dirty , " he said . He took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their way to the office , he asked : " What made you decide to come ? " " I thought that if we ate here , you would have time to rest , and you would n't have to waste time on the drive . " They went into the office . Tuvia put the basket down on a chair and went over to the sink , and Hagar cleared away the account books scattered over the surface of the table . It was cool inside the office , which was a long room with plastered but unpainted walls . On the outside the gray blocks were naked and exposed . For some reason , the cool air in the room made Hagar feel tired , and she sat down next to the table . " It 's actually chilly in here , " she said , " but suddenly I feel as if I have n't got any strength . " Tuvia 's sleeves were rolled up , his arms and hands full of soap . He washed off the soap and dried himself on the threadbare towel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a month 's time , " he said , " we can go for a holi-day . " And turning to face her , he added : " This year we 'll go first . " She spread a cloth over the table , took the plates and cutlery out of the basket and set them on it . Then she opened the cupboard , got out the electric kettle ' and filled  | it with water . When Tuvia sat down at the table she took a bottle of red wine out of the basket . " I 'm glad you came , " he said . " Lately we seem to have drifted a little apart . " " Yes . I need something to do . I 've got too much spare time . " " Maybe you should write home and ask them to send your books . " " Do you think I can do it ? " " If you work . " They ate spicy meatballs and drank wine . Every now and then they heard the roar of a car speeding past on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room it seemed as if a breeze was blowing outside . But the trees outside the window were motionless . " Yiftach 's going to have lunch at our house , " she said as they drank their coffee . " His mother 's taken the baby to the hospital again . " Tuvia said nothing . He gripped the handle of his cup and stared at the black coffee . " Is anything wrong ? " she asked . " There 's nothing wrong with Yiftach , he 's fine . But Sarah , you know . . . and the baby 's not normal . . . . " " What about Sarah ? " " You 're not from here . I still remember her wrapping oranges in the citrus grove . And living alone in that shack . Why have n't you got any other friends ? " " You do n't need to worry about me and my friends . I can take care of myself . What have you got against Sarah ? "  | His eyes remained fixed on the cup of coffee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he said . Hagar stood up and opened the window , leaned on the cool sill and looked outside . Next to the police station she saw Yoel 's jeep coming back . She returned to the table , packed the dishes in the basket , and walked out of the room , leaving her unfinished coffee on the table . " Do you want me to drive you home ? " Tuvia called after her . " No need , " she said . " I 'll take the bus . " At home she stacked the dishes in the sink , and then she laid the table with a single place . For Yiftach . When he did n't come , she washed the dishes , and after she had finished she heard a knock at the door . Yiftach walked in , his satchel on his back . His hair was cut , and there were bits of hair on his shirt . " You finished school so late ? " She went up to him and took the satchel off his back . " Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my dad , " he said . " Really ? Where ? " " At Kasos 's . " " You do n't get a decent meal at Kasos 's . Why do n't you eat what I made for you too ? It is n't much . I see you had time for a haircut too . " " Yes . My dad took me . Leibowitz was still open and there was n't anybody before us . " Yiftach ate a meatball and after that he and Hagar both had stewed fruit . Throughout the meal he kept looking at Hagar as if there was something he wanted to tell her . Hagar noticed , but she did n't say anything .  | The shutters were closed and the house was in semidarkness , with a light burning in the kitchen . " You can take your sandals off and go barefoot if you like , " said Hagar . He sat huddled on the chair , his teaspoon in the empty dish . She patted his shirt and brushed off the hairs sticking to it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dishes off the table . " Take a shower , and then you can have a rest . " " I want to put my satchel away at home , " he said . " I can wash there . " " You can leave your satchel here , " she said . She put on her apron and turned on the tap over the sink . " Go and take a shower , you 'll feel better . We 'll have a little rest , and later in the afternoon we 'll go for a walk in the Arab village again . " Yiftach did not reply . " If we meet the soldier we 'll return the canteen . " The irritating splashing of the water muffled her words , but he distinctly heard her say : " If he does n't want to take it back , I 'll let you keep it . " His hands gripped the edge of the table , his fingers squeezing hard . He was afraid to look at her . His eyes were fixed on the table . It seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face , and he no longer looked like himself . " I do n't need the canteen , " he said quickly . " Why ? " she asked , turning to look at him . A lock of hair fell over her eyes . She brushed the hair off her face  | with her arm . Her hands were covered with a layer of foam . In the end he took a shower at her house . A strange smell of shaving soap and cosmetics pervaded the shower . There were two colored towels hanging next to the mirror . Among the bottles of perfume and jars of cream on the shelf , he noticed a rusty razor blade . He looked at himself in the mirror . There were wisps of hair plastered to his forehead , but the part was straight as a ruler . He rumpled his hair with his fingers and got into the shower . Hagar spread two sheets and a blanket on the living room floor , and Yiftach took off his shirt and sandals , and lay down with the upper half of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room was dark . Yiftach could n't fall asleep . He tossed and turned for a while and then he got up , turned on the light in the room , and went over to the low bookcase standing next to the window . As he was looking for a book he came across a photograph album . He paged through it and saw Hagar and Tuvia in their youth . He saw their house . On one of the pages he saw his own family , when he was still a baby without any hair . In the picture his mother was wearing an apron , and his father was carrying the bag in which he took his sandwiches to work . His little brother was not yet born . The picture had been taken in the afternoon . His parents ' shadows fell to the east of the dirt road . He himself left no mark on the sand . When he woke up Hagar was already in the kitchen . He washed his face and sat down in his favorite chair .  | Hagar went out to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canteen . She washed it in the sink , and then she opened the refrigerator and filled it with the cold coffee which she had prepared in the morning . The coffee left over in the jar she poured into two cups , adding whipped cream to Yiftach 's cup . " We 'll give him a surprise , " she said . " The soldier ? " " Yes . He 's not used to having coffee in his canteen . Especially iced coffee . " " How do you know that he 'll be there ? " Hagar hesitated for a moment . She sipped her coffee , and then she said : " He 'll be there . He 's been coming every day for several days now . " Yiftach licked the whipped cream and looked at the canteen standing at the end of the table . It was clean , there was n't a trace of mud on it . " The canteen 'll get hot , " he said . " I did n't think of that , " said Hagar . She wrapped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I want you to give it to him , " she said . " I do n't need it , " said Yiftach , and put it down on the table . " But yesterday you asked me for it , did n't you ? " They left by the big iron gate through which Tuvia always drove the jeep into the yard . Yiftach did n't speak . Hagar asked him questions , and he responded by jerking his head or mumbling unintelligibly . She held her knitting bag , and he carried the canteen wrapped in the damp , yellow dishcloth . At the end of the road Yiftach  | picked up a dry branch and trailed it along the wire fence . It made a rhythmic , creaking noise . Hagar did n't say anything . Instead of walking over the field they took a path leading through the citrus grove . The path was shady , but suddenly mosquitoes appeared , flying into their hair , darting against their foreheads . Yiftach held the canteen loosely . He dragged the dry branch behind him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path emerged into a patch of sunlight , they blinked , and Yiftach dropped the canteen . The damp , yellow cloth wrapped around the canteen was muddied by the sand . Hagar put her knitting bag down on the ground , and rubbed the cloth with her hand . Instead of getting the mud off , however , she only succeeded in rubbing it deeper in . " What 's the matter with you ? " she asked . " Nothing , " he said . " Is that why you finally agreed to take the canteen ? " The lines on her forehead came together , her face fell . " Look what you 've done ! " He was silent . Hagar unwrapped the cloth from the canteen . She put the canteen into her knitting bag , and held the cloth in her hand . " Why do n't we go into Noah Bulkin 's and wash the cloth off ? " said Yiftach suddenly . " We go right past his place . " " Where did you get that idea from ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | told me I could come and see him if I felt like it . " Bulkin was not at home . Only the chickens cackled in the henhouse , and the sacks of feed spread a dry warmth . They went into the yard and made for the big tap standing at the entrance to the house . A pair of clean , wet , black rubber boots stood next to it . Yiftach ran up to the tap and drank . When he had finished Hagar washed the cloth , and then she too drank from the tap . She took the canteen out of her bag and wrapped it up again . She looked around the yard for a piece of string . Not finding any , she tore a length of wool from the ball in her knitting bag , and tied the cloth to the canteen with it . The canteen looked like a potbellied water jar , and Yiftach said : " Give it to me , I want to carry it now . " " Careful , " said Hagar . Yiftach was standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with black letters staring from them lay scattered around the can . " What 's this ? " Yiftach picked up the rough brush and stuck it into the glue . " At night he sticks up all kinds of posters on the walls . " " What for ? " " Never mind . " Again they entered the shade between the trees . In the distance a thin spiral of smoke rose into the sky . " Look , " said Hagar . " They 're there . " " Who ? " " The soldiers . " " Is he there too ? " asked Yiftach . A stone-paved alley led them to the village . There were 71  | dry cacti withering at its sides . The walls behind the cactus bushes hid ruined houses , piles of rubble . At the bend in the road stood an undamaged house . They went iii side , and climbed a staircase to the flat roof . The soldiers were divided into two groups . One group was sitting on the ground , in the shade of a ruined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stones , which supported long , thin iron spits upon which stood some blackened tin cans . Three soldiers bustled around the fire , feeding the flames with twigs and watching the cans to see that they did n't fall over . One soldier was eat ing from a can with a spoon . When he had completed his share he passed the can and the spoon to his neighbor . The second group of soldiers was training . They hid behind a cactus hedge and crept toward an isolated building at the edge of the village . When they reached hillock covered with thorns at a short distance from the building , they stopped . Two soldiers armed with machine guns dropped to the ground and lay on the slope of the hillock , aiming their guns at the door and windows of the building . The rest of the soldiers went on creeping along the cactus hedge and advanced in a slight flanking movement toward the house . Then they stopped for a moment , and suddenly charged to the entrance and flattened themselves against the wall . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and after a short pause they all burst into the building and disappeared into the darkness . From the cooking fire next to the wall smoke spiraled into the sky .  | The he three men tending the fire were replaced by three others . After charging the house the soldiers emerged again and returned to the stone fence . They lined up in a row , raised their guns , and inserted the magazines . Then they knelt down . The commander , who was standing , spoke to the kneeling men . " Are they going to shoot ? " Yiftach asked Hagar . They sat on the flat roof . The full sun was far in the west , close to the invisible sea . A cool wind blew over the roof , brushing their faces . Hagar took the scarf off her head . " Yes . But do n't be afraid . They 're not live bullets . " " What are they ? " " Wooden bullets . " " Are you sure ? " The soldiers rose , holding their guns with both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few steps they stopped . All their faces were turned to the roof on which Hagar and Yiftach were sitting . The commander waved his hand , but Hagar and Yiftach did not move from their places . Then one of the soldiers left the row and made his way toward them . He passed between the ruins , disappearing and reappearing alternately . Hagar and Yiftach came down from the roof , emerged from the house , and went to meet the soldier . Next to a blocked well in the middle of a bare , spacious courtyard they met him . " Hi , " said the soldier . " Hi , " said Hagar .  | " I 've already seen you once before , " said the soldier , " but you 're not allowed to be here now . Did n't you see the red flags ? " " It was you we walked to the truck with , right ? " said Yiftach . " Yes . But you have to leave now . This is a firing zone and people are shooting here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Hagar . " What about the canteen ? " asked Yiftach . " We 'll give it back to him another time . " " Did you bring the canteen ? " asked the soldier . Hagar put her hand out to Yiftach . " You do n't have to leave . You can go back inside the house . Stay there until the firing stops . But do n't go up to the roof . " The soldier disappeared between the houses and Hagar and Yiftach went inside . When her eyes got used to the dark , Hagar saw colored tiles in a circle of squares around a white stone in the middle of the room . The floor was dirty . They sat down on a step , Hagar hugging her knees with her arms while Yiftach stretched his legs out in front of him . " Have you got the canteen ? " asked Yiftach . " Yes , " said Hagar . " Why did n't you give it to him ? " " We 'll give it to him afterward . " " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I got a good look at him , " said Hagar . " He 'll be the last . "  | " Listen , " said Yiftach . " I want to tell you something . . . . " He did n't finish the sentence . The firing began . They both fell silent . When the firing stopped , they heard the clatter of running boots . Yiftach stood up and began climbing the steps . " Wait a bit longer , " said Hagar . But Yiftach went on climbing . " Come here , " she called . " You said you wanted to tell me something . " But Yiftach was already at the top of the stairs . She climbed up after him , and after ascending a few steps she heard a single shot . She stopped , hugged the wall , called Yiftach 's name , and started running up the stairs . The soldiers who had conquered the building came out again , jumping through the windows and the doors . They formed a row and headed for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been sitting along the wall and eating from the cans strapped on their packs , picked up the weapons which had been propped tip against the wall , and moved off . They walked over to the end of the cactus hedge . The flames had all died down , but the wood was still burning , giving off heat and smoke and the glow of shining red embers . Nobody went up to feed the fire . Hagar climbed onto the roof . Yiftach was sitting on the edge , swinging his legs to and fro in the air , hitting the wall with his feet . He did n't notice Hagar standing behind him , her skin stretched tight over her face , her arms hanging at the sides of her body . " Did n't you hear the shot ? " Yiftach did n't turn his head .  | " Come on , " she said . " They have n't finished shooting yet . " " But they 're not shooting in this direction , and I want to see them . " " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shirt collar and tugged it . He stood up and followed her , hanging his head . " You gave me a fright , " she said , after they had seated themselves on the step again . The shooting began again . It went on for a few minutes and then stopped . " We can go now , " said Yiftach . " We 'd better wait a bit longer , " said Hagar . She looked at the window . There was a faint buzzing in her ears . " Was there something you wanted to tell me ? " Yiftach 's head was resting on his knees . " No , " he said . " I was just humming . " Rough steps thudded on the stones , and the soldier 's head appeared at the window . " We 've finished , " he said . " You can come out now . " He was wearing a steel helmet , and they could see the straps of his backpack on his shoulders . In the shade cast by the helmet his sweat glis-tened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the window . " Is the truck waiting for you ? " asked Yiftach . The soldiers were heading for the citrus grove again . " Yes , " said the soldier . " Why are n't you going with them ? " asked Hagar .  | " I wanted to tell you that you can come out and walk around again . We 're finished . " The three of them walked over to the dying fire . When they reached it the soldier kicked up the ground and covered it with sand . Gray streaks ran down the leather of his boots , which had been rubbed with black boot-polish that morning . " We 've brought something for you , " said Hagar . The soldier looked at her . " Do n't you remember what we talked about yester-day ? " she asked . " But I told you , it 's not my canteen . " " It is yours , " said Hagar and she reached into her bag and took out the canteen wrapped in the yellow cloth . " Here , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A drink is something else , " he said . He opened the canteen and took a sip . " It 's coffee ! " There were black drops on his lips . He smiled . The steel helmet was lying on the ground . His gun was propped against the wall . His hair was plastered to his scalp , and streaks of dried , brown sweat ran down his face . His lips were broad and cracked , his cheeks were covered with stubble . His cheekbones were high and bronzed . He held the canteen in his hand . " The coffee is cold , " he said . I lagar and Yiftach were silent . The setting sun cast red and gray colors over the  | village . The dry grass , because of the shade falling on it , and because of the weak rays of the sun caressing it , looked brighter , green and alive . A light breeze began to caress the walls of the abandoned houses , and Hagar took the scarf out of her knitting bag and tied it round her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a faint shadowy line around her forehead and her pink cheeks . Her lips were pale , her green eyes fixed on the ground . Without thinking she held out her hand to Yiftach . They held hands as the soldier strapped on his pack and hoisted his gun to his shoulder , holding the canteen in his hand . He began walking away . He left the path which was lit up by the sun . They were still standing in the shade next to the wall , opposite the two stones on which the soldiers had supported their cooking grid . He emerged from the patch of sunlight and entered the shade of a low palm with a rough trunk , where he stopped and turned to face Hagar and Yiftach . " I forgot to thank you , " he said . " That was a great idea . " They walked toward him , holding hands . The tail of Hagar 's scarf waved in the wind as they joined him next to the palm tree . Wordlessly the soldier handed the canteen to Yiftach . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went into the field . At the other end of the field they saw the last soldiers going into the orange grove . At first they walked side by side , but the thorns got in their way , and so they stepped back onto the narrow  | path and walked one behind the other . The soldier , Yiftach , and Hagar . The field was exposed to the sun , now balanced on the points of the roofs , and the soldier 's face glistened with sweat again . The path broadened , and 1 agar walked next to Yiftach . " Will you be here tomorrow ? " asked Yiftach . " Tomorrow ? ! " said the soldier . " Tomorrow 's Friday , and the next day 's Saturday . " " And what will you do ? " Without waiting for an answer , Yiftach held the canteen out to the soldier . " Take it , " he said . " It 's yours . " " Never mind , " said the soldier . " You can keep it . " There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if recalling Yiftach 's question , said : " Tomorrow we clean the weapons and get organized . On Saturday morning we stay in the camp and rest , but in the afternoon we get leave till midnight . " " Will you go home ? " asked Hagar . " No . I live in Haifa . I 'll go to Tel Aviv . " " Are you giving me the canteen for a present ? " asked Yiftach . The soldier patted Yiftach on the back . " Yes , " he said . " What will you do in Tel Aviv ? " asked Hagar . They were now on the edge of the orange grove . " What does anyone do in Tel Aviv ? Hang around Mograbi . On the promenade . " Yiftach held the canteen in both hands . His eyes were fixed on the yellow dishcloth in which it was wrapped . The soldier took his gun off his shoulder and leaned on it . Hagar tightened the knot of her scarf , and looked at  | the soldier 's brown face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without moving . Behind him were the fruitless trees . " Is he your son ? " asked the soldier . " No , " she said quietly . At the end of the field , in the distance , they saw a small , square van . Noah Bulkin and his Arab worker , Hilmi , were moving around next to it . They approached a low pile of sacks . The soldier held out his hand to Hagar . They shook hands , said good-bye , and parted . Yiftach and Hagar watched the green and gray uniform disappearing into the trees . In the hollows , between the dry leaves , little purple flowers bloomed . After that they walked away . The field was empty except for Bulkin and Hilmi loading the sacks onto the back of the van in the distance . Yiftach and Hagar walked toward them , but they had already finished loading the van . Hilmi closed the tailgate , and joined Bulkin in the cab . " What 's this ? " said Yiftach . " Has Bulkin got a van ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it came close they could see the two men behind the dusty window . The wheels crushed the grass , broke the thorns and trampled them into the ground . Bulkin stuck his head out of the window and said " Hello . " He was n't wearing a shirt , and Yiftach saw his broad , hairy shoulders , and the straps of his gray undershirt.  | " Since when have you had a van ? " he asked . " Since I got my hair cut today at Leibowitz 's , " said Bulkin . " You should know all about it . I want to buy a horse . And in order to bring it here I need a van . It 's simple . " " Are you buying a horse ? " asked Yiftach . " Yes , next week . " " Where ? " " In the market . " " The market ? What market ? " " The horse market . In Acre . You should know . And that 's why I bought the van too , in Tuvia 's garage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Congratulations , " she said . " Congratulations to you too , " he said . " You 'll be able to buy a few more dresses . It 's Tuvia 's father 's Morris . At last it 's left the family . " " Do you want a ride ? " he asked . " No , " said Hagar . " Will you take me to the market ? " asked Yiftach . " Of course , " said Bulkin . The Arab sat in the corner of the cab , leaning on the door . He said nothing . The van moved off . They crossed the field and went up to the road . Cars and carts passed them . Then a dirt road intersected with the highway and they turned into it . It was the road that led to the cemetery , the plowed field , and the school . " Are you glad you got the canteen ? " Yiftach did n't answer , but every now and then he  | grasped the canteen in both hands and held it to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hagar . " I 'll sew you a cover for it . From the yellow dishcloth . " To their left was the cemetery , deserted . There was a light on in the gravedigger 's hut . The deep furrows in the plowed field were smooth , and where an accidental sunbeam hit them they shone . Yiftach looked at the furrows and bit his lips . He bowed his head and stopped walking . " Let 's go back , " he said . He walked next to her , kicking stones , running ahead and coming back to her . Only when they reached the street where they lived did he seem to calm down . " Will you give me the canteen , then , so I can sew you a cover for it ? " " You see , " he said , " there 's a light on in my house . " Evening had already invaded the street , and the streetlights were on , even though it was still possible to see without them . " You know , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've been wanting to tell you all day . " He gave her the canteen , and when she put it into her knitting bag , she said : " Tell me then .... " But Yiftach said again : " There 's a light on in my house , " and began running down the street to his house . He went into the yard , and the lamp above the front door went on . The street was deserted . Only the streetlights , without which she still would have been able to see , were burning . Hagar walked slowly in the sand , alone .  | Saturday . The sun blazed over the sea and the beach . They came home at noon , their burning skin salty . They showered , ate bread and butter , drank a glass of milk . They stood next to the table and Tuvia asked : " Have you written home and asked them to send you your books ? If you 've made up your mind , you should do something . " He was standing between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a white T-shirt , his hair wet and smooth , combed back . " I 've made up my mind , " she said . And then , feeling that a few more words were necessary , she added : " But I wo n't write to them . I 'll go down there one day and get them myself . " " Why do n't you do it tomorrow ? " " Maybe I will , " she said . She put the dishes in the sink , and without washing them went to lie down . It was two o'clock . " We 'd better set the alarm , " he said . " Why ? " " We 're going to the theater tonight with Yoel and his wife , have you forgotten ? The play starts at nine , but I have to buy tickets . " " What time should I set it for ? " She picked up the alarm clock , which was standing on the little bedside table . " Quarter to five , " he said .  | wo n't be back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will want to talk to you . Anyway , there are n't any buses to Netanya yet . " " I 'll be back in time . It 's only quarter to three . I wo n't stay long . I 'll take a taxi . " " Why did n't you tell me in the morning ? We could have driven down together . And anyway , why do you have to go now ? All of a sudden , without making any plans . What 's gotten She set the alarm , and he covered his body with a sheet , lay on his back , and closed his eyes . Her head was buried in the pillow . Tuvia 's hand reached for her under the sheet . She put her small hand into his hard , sinewy one , and thus they remained . Gradually Tuvia 's hand relaxed . The fingers enclosing her hand slipped back . It was cool in the room . The shutters and the windows were closed . Outside a breeze blew with a soft , piercing whistle . Tuvia was already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . The sheet now covered only half her body , and she tugged gently at it to cover her leg , suddenly exposed to the chill of the dark room . She could n't fall asleep . Her head buried in the pillow was wide awake . She looked at the clock but she could barely make out the figures and the hands . She switched on the little reading light . It was ten past two . She switched off the light . In a last attempt to fall asleep , she closed her eyes and lay without moving . Her skin was sunburned and the contact with the mattress and sheets hurt her . Again she switched on the lamp , and in the dim light bathing the room she turned her head to look at her husband . The light did not disturb his sleep , and she let her bare feet down to the cold floor . Then she stood up , undid the buttons of her nightgown , and threw it onto the bed . She opened the wardrobe . The door creaked slightly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She took out a short summer dress , a scarf , and a long , narrow , brown leather  | bag . Then she switched off the lamp and padded barefoot to the bathroom . She got dressed quickly , combed her hair which was still damp from the shower , brushed her teeth , and drew a narrow black line around her eyes . At the last moment she took off the high-heeled shoes she had chosen and changed them for flat ones . She sat on the folding chair in the bathroom , and as she pushed her foot into the narrow black shoe she saw , lying in the corner , the canteen and the yellow dishcloth which she had promised Yiftach to make into a cover . After glancing at the mirror again she returned to the bedroom . The flat felt shoes made no noise . She stood next to the bed and hesitated . Tuvia was asleep . Without switching on the light she woke him up . " What 's up ? " he asked . " I 've decided to go now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " To fetch the books . " " Why on earth now ? You can go tomorrow . We 're going out this evening . Youinto you ? Go tomorrow . "  | By now Tuvia was wide awake . He threw off the sheet and sat on the edge of the bed with his feet on the floor . " Why do n't you switch on the light ? " he asked . " I 'm going , " she said . " Good-bye . Do n't worry , I wo n't be late . Buy me a ticket . " She kissed him , said , " Go back to sleep , " and walked out of the room . He lay down and wrapped the sheet tightly around him , as if he felt cold . His open eyes stared at the wall . In the dim light of the room it was hard to see himself and Hagar in the photograph hanging on the wall . But even in the dark he could see the black frame standing out against the white background . He was tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curled up in the sheet and listened to Hagar 's footsteps on the paved path . He could hardly hear her , only the rustling of the rosebush which had grown onto the path told him that she had brushed against it as she passed . He heard the creaking of the gate opening and closing . Silence descended on the room again , and he snuggled deep down into the sheet . After a while he crawled over the big double bed and lit the little reading lamp . On the bottom shelf of the bedside table he found some old magazines and an open book . Bending over , his head almost touching the floor , he turned the pages , and finally he put out the light , rolled over , and closed his eyes . Tuvia Erlich was Yehiel Erlich 's oldest son . Yehiel owned the soda factory which stood not far from the main road , surrounded by tall eucalyptus and cypress trees . Despite  | The lack of sunlight , lemon trees grew in the yard , and ferns climbed onto the veranda of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the factory , in the same yard . The many trees cast a perpetual shade over the yard , and this , together with the black soot covering the unpainted factory walls , made it always seem dark there . Yehiel Erlich was a heavyset man of medium height , and his eyes , hidden under black , beetle brows , seemed to look at the world sideways . He was n't walleyed , but his irises were always in the corners of his eyes , from which he looked out obliquely at the people he was talking to , and at the crates of soda that he sold in the market . His face was lined , and there was a deep cleft in his chin . A broad mustache dipped to the corners of his mouth , and his long hair was slightly curly and usually embed back . The strange look in his eyes , the mustache t hat was never shaven , the flat cap which shaded his eyes and left two unruly curls above his ears , gave his face a look at once frightening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon after he came to the village with his wife , people said his mustache was a sign of good nature . But after he bought the two horses and t he cart from Staysky , the orange grove owner for whom he worked digging basins , the attitude toward him changed . In the cafe he spoke dirty Yiddish , and to the young people born in the village he spoke the pure , fluent Hebrew he had learned in the cheder . In the beginning of his career as a cart-driver he worked in the surrounding Arab villages . At the same time he also learned Arabic . There was always someone sitting next to him when he  | drove the cart . Usually they were Arabs , getting a ride to or from work . It was Tabak who said to Kasos : " The Arab tells him the words and the sentences , and Erlich writes them down in Yiddish in his notebook . He writes Arabic in Yiddish . " After that Kasos could n't take his eyes off the fat cardboard notebook which Erlich kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his heart , and in which he wrote everything down . His work schedule , the money he owed , and the money owed to him . Later he wrote down the soda pop orders , the balance of debts , and the customers ' addresses . The notebook must have been changed a number of times but it always looked like the same notebook : a brown cardboard cover , ragged at the corners , with a yellow pencil sticking out of the pages . Not far from the village the British built an army camp . The sides of Erlich 's cart rose higher , and he began transporting sacks of cement and gravel from the nearby quarries to the camp . The English paid by the load . Erlich 's cart went back and forth , his horses were always sweating , and pale stripes appeared on their flanks from the lashes of his whip . He made many trips a day , but the foreman always gave him credit for five more . Nobody knew if Erlich paid him for this arrangement , or if it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Englishman , who had dinner at Erlich 's house every Friday night . The camp took two years to build , and when it was finished Erlich sold his horses and bought the neglected plot , whose owners had moved to Jaffa on their way to Berlin , immediately after planting the trees  | on it . Where he had learned the secret of making soda nobody knew . From the blocks which he transported to his yard from the army camp he built a small factory , equipped it with the necessary machines and raw materials , planted ferns under the windows , on the veranda balustrade , and began to sell . Once in a while he would go to the cafe to play dominoes . In spite of the lines etched deeply in his face , and the sprinkling of gray which had begun to invade his hair , his opponents watched him like hawks , as if he were a crook out to cheat them . And indeed , he almost always won , even though he put the dominoes on the table with frank , open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His wife , Rivka , was hardly ever seen . She went to buy groceries at Tabak 's once a day , and the rest of the time she stayed at home . Tuvia was their first son , but their third child . Before giving birth to him , Rivka had had two daughters , one after the other . The first daughter got married as soon as she graduated from high school and went to live with her husband in Jerusalem . The second daughter began giving them trouble when she was still in high school , which she left after only two years . She went to work as a clerk in Tel Aviv , which was not at all to Yehiel Erlich 's liking , and once he even bawled her out about it . She was still behaving in the same way when she was twenty-two years old , and from the letters he received in London from his parents , Tuvia understood that something was wrong with their relationship with the only daughter still under their care . After he had graduated from technical college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economics and " broaden his horizons , " as he called it . " You 're not going to be some miserable mechanic , " he said to his son when he discovered that his favorite pastime was fiddling with the machines in the factory , and fixing them when necessary . He did n't profit by it , but everyone said that he exploited even his son . Because whenever the old Morris broke down , instead of putting it in the garage , Yehiel would entrust it to the reliable hands of his son . " Saving money , eh ? " Tabak would say to him , on the rare occasions when he visited the cafe , and sat squinting at the dominoes and tugging at the lock of gray hair poking out of the flat cap which he never removed from his head . The only subject Tuvia could speak about to his father was business . But to his mother he hardly spoke at all . He liked seeing her in her clean white apron on Friday nights , in her white lace dress , lighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It seemed to him that only in the letters which reached him in London , was he becoming acquainted with another side of his father , an unfamiliar , rather sensitive side . " What can I say and what can I tell you , " he wrote in one letter , " the house , the yard with all its trees , are empty without you . " And when he met an Israeli girl called Rochelle in London and thought of marrying her , and wrote home : " What would you do if I got married one day ? " Yehiel Erlich replied : " Regarding what you wrote to us , you should know that all parents want to see their children married , and to have joy of them . If you have made up your mind , please give us more details about Rochelle : What does  | she do ? What do her parents do ? If you have decided to get married , we are very happy . About details such as an apartment , etc. , we can speak later . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't disturb your studies , and therefore I intend sending you , this coming week , a new pair of shoes . " After spending two years in London , Tuvia returned when the war broke out . He was mobilized as soon as he arrived , and the personnel classification officer , with some sixth sense , posted him to the light maintenance company permanently attached to the Givati Brigade . He would see the wounded , sweating soldiers coming back from the front while he lay underneath the battered command cars , trying to keep their engines alive with his hands for one more week , and sometimes even for one more night . Only once , at the end of the war , did he find himself under fire . With another mechanic he was attached to an assault force mounted on jeeps . They rode in the last jeep , and although they heard the men firing and shells exploding around them , they drove slowly in the relative quiet of the rear , until suddenly they received a radio communication ordering them to advance to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had been left behind by the rest of the company . Standing still , it provided an easy target for the enemy , who had not yet abandoned their dugouts on the hill . " Let 's see who they hit first , " Tuvia 's companion laughed . But the bullets did n't even hit their wheels , and Tuvia quickly located the source of the trouble in the engine . In the repaired jeep they pursued the CO , who had changed  | jeeps in the course of the battle . " You got here in the nick of time , " the CO roared at them , jumping into the command jeep with his team . When they were still quite close to the jeep a shell fell directly on it , killing the entire command team on the spot . Tuvia and his friend immediately dropped to the ground . But the friend was already fatally wounded . Only his head was unhurt , and his face was smooth and pure . Tuvia went up to him , and he said : " You were always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had already been over for a year when he met Hagar , she was always cross-examining him about what he had done in it , and sometimes he was glad , in the depths of his heart , that he had at least one interesting story to tell . At the same time , there was no doubt that she enjoyed the attention he paid her . The flowers , the records , the key-rings courting manners which he could only have acquired in England . She remembered one Saturday afternoon , when she stood behind the curtain and watched what was happening in the street . The night before they had quarreled at a party given by friends , because she had danced too much , in his opinion , and he had argued too loudly , in hers . Now she saw him walking down the street with a bunch of flowers in his hands , accosting some little boys playing there . He spoke to them , but they took no notice of him . Only one boy stopped next to him , and she saw him dropping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook his head , and Tuvia added a few more coins , and when the child was still not satisfied , he took back all the coins and replaced them with a bill . He himself turned around 1833  | and took up his position behind a ficus tree , which cast its shade over a dilapidated public bench . The little boy , who was wearing a clean white shirt and short khaki pains , entered the building . Hagar abandoned her post behind the curtain and went over to the door . She heard his sandals clattering on the stairs , and then she heard the bell ring . She opened the door and the boy gave her the flowers . She wanted to give him something , but he ran away . With the bunch of flowers in her hands , she resumed her post behind the curtain . Tuvia was still standing behind the ficus tree , his hands resting on the back of the bench . He was wearing a suit and a tie . The little boy walked past him , and when Tuvia followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bench , and she took the flowers into the kitchen , where she threw the wrapping paper into the bin and looked for a note . But there was no note . Yehiel Erlich did not live to see the marriage of his only son . In spite of his second daughter , Edna 's , many suitors , it was Yehiel who found her a husband . He invited the family of an old countryman of his from Vilna , now living in Hadera , to dine with himself , his wife , Tuvia and Edna . The elderly couple came that same Friday night , but their son , who was about to complete his legal studies in Jerusalem , stayed over to spend the Sabbath with the Erlich family . The next day the young man took Edna to the movies , and amazingly enough , no cars hooted outside their house , and no stranger from Tel Aviv knocked at the door and asked : " Is Edna at home ? " Two months later they were married and went to live in  | Jerusalem , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My family 's moving to Jerusalem , " said Yehiel Erlich , and he would sometimes ask Tuvia , half humorously , half seriously : " When are you moving too ? " After seeing both his daughters settled , he bought an empty lot and began building a house for his son . In the cafe Kasos would say to him : " I hear your children are giving you joy . " " Yes , they 're giving me joy , " Yehiel Erlich would reply , " now we only have to wait for the lad . " But at the same time , he began to get bored . He began paying frequent visits to the cafe , and although all his hair was now white , his mind was not on the game . Or in the words of Tabak : " Erlich , you 're not an interesting partner any more . " One day he invited a lawyer to his house and made his will , " so there wo n't be any problems with the inheri-tance . " When the document had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lawyer asked : " And what about the factory and the plot ? " Erlich gave him a look which brought the black back to his hair , as in the days when he had driven his cart back and forth from the quarry to the British army camp . " The soda factory , the plot , the house , I 'm selling the lot . You have to be close to your family to get some joy out of life . We 're moving to Jerusalem . " Like the lawyer , this was the first his wife had heard of his decision too . And when she dared to open her mouth and ask : " What 's all this about ? " he said again : " We 're getting old , Rivka , and the place to be old is with our children , in Jerusalem . " The lawyer lit a  | cigarette , and put it out again immediately when Erlich gave him his squinting look , accompanied by a grunt of rebuke . " What 's all this about Jerusalem ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're moving to Jerusalem , and we 're leaving Tuvia here . Soon the house will be built , he 'll be settled too . " " Why should we leave Tuvia here ? Why ca n't we take him with us ? " asked Rivka . " Why ? " Erlich asked rhetorically , in a judicious , allknowing tone . " Because it 's not good for them to be all together . The girls will quarrel , as usual , and then it will be good to know that we 've got one son here , who can come from a distance and be wise and make the peace between them . Now do you understand why ? " The lawyer did n't know what to do with his hands upon hearing this outlandish pronouncement , and he buried his eyes in the carpet . " You ca n't leave Tuvia here alone , without a home , without asking him . He 's our son too . Why should n't he be next to us too ? " " And what do you think the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it 's not finished . " " It will be finished soon . And in the meantime Tuvia can find somewhere to stay here . Even a hotel , why not ? He 's not a child . " " You 're always forcing people , " said Rivka with uncharacteristic aggression , and rose to her feet . " What are you getting up for ? " said Erlich . " I 've  | decided . I 'm not going to help him with the house any more . It 's his house , let him finish it himself . And that 's why he 's staying here . " " Did you ask him ? Why are you always jumping into things ? Maybe he does n't want the house , maybe he does n't want to stay here at all . Have you asked him ? All you do is force people , even your own son . And anyway , I ca n't see what 's wrong with him coming with us to Jerusalem . How do you think we 'll be able to live in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his wife to sit down at the table again . He did n't even see the lawyer , who had risen from his place in the meantime , and gone over to stand by the open window . " In the first place , forcing . I 'm not forcing anyone . Tuvia himself would never agree to come with us . He 'll want to stay here . I 'm not forcing anyone . You 'll see . He 'll want to stay here . " " You 'll persuade him , " Rivka interrupted . " Let me finish , " he continued . " I wo n't say a word . He 'll do what he wants . That 's as far as forcing is concerned . And now Jerusalem . That 's to say , in the second place , Jerusalem . First , Jerusalem is n't a strange place . Apart from which , we have two daughters there , and soon maybe we 'll have something else too . So , firstly , I 'm not forcing anyone . With me everybody does just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course . And secondly , Jerusalem . . . . " He left the sentence unfinished , and as if after some strenuous effort , he leaned on the back of his chair , sighed , glanced at the lawyer standing  | at the window , and said to his wife : " We have a guest , why do n't you bring him a cup of tea ? " At the time of this discussion , Tuvia was working in a garage in one of the nearby settlements , and when he came home that day from work , tired and unshaven , even before he had taken a shower , his mother said , " We have something to tell you . " But Erlich cut in : " Let him wash up first . " And after Tuvia had gone into the bathroom , he continued : " First we have to sell the house and the plot , and then we can tell him . And I have n't even found a buyer yet , so what 's the point of talking . When there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prepare him , " said Rivka . " You do n't want him to have time to think , to decide for himself . Because I 'm positive that he 'll want to leave here too , and come with us . " Erlich paced to and fro next to the frying pan and snatched a little chopped meat from the oil and onions in which it was frying . " There 's nothing to tell him . He already knows whatever there is to know . He even knows that we 're going to move . " " How can you be so sure ? " " There are things a person senses , and there 's no need to talk about them . " " You want to surprise him , I know you . " " When I 've sold everything . I 'll tell him . I wo n't tell him what to do . He wo n't be surprised . There are things a person senses , and there 's no need to talk about them . " When they sat down to eat she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went off to Hadera and Tel Aviv . He was away from home for two days , and when he returned on Thursday morning , he said to Rivka : " That 's that . " An hour later two middle-aged men wearing suits and hats knocked at the door . Rivka showed them the house , and Erlich showed them the factory and the yard . He paced and counted aloud , measuring off the area of the plot . They said they needed time to think , but Erlich realized immediately that this was a trick , and said : " We 'll be here until tomorrow morning , and after that we 're leav-ing . " At eight o'clock on Friday morning they knocked on the door again , and at Erlich 's request they paid all the thousands in cash . As soon as they had left , two moving men arrived in the yard with a truck . " What are they doing here ? " asked Rivka . " I told you we were leaving today . " Rivka was silent , and after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only saying that because of the buyers . " He looked at her , as if to say : " You know I never say anything I do n't mean . " The movers began packing up their belongings in the big wooden crates they had brought in the truck , and when Rivka wanted to advise them , he said : " Let them be , it 's their profession . " Erlich went into the factory , took out two crates of soda and left them by the gate . " We might as well take these with us , " he said . When all the cupboards were packed , and ' the open  | shutters revealed empty walls , Tuvia was standing at the gate in his blue overalls , his lunch bag in his hand . Erlich went up to him . " Hurry up and wash , " he said , " we 're moving to Jerusalem . " " What ? " " Ca n't you see that we 're almost finished packing ? Do n't waste time . The more time you waste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there 's our health to consider too , the sleep we 'll lose tonight . " Rivka ran up to him , embraced him , and said : " Do n't ask questions , Tuvia . We 're moving . Come on . " Tuvia was still confused . He advanced to the threshold of the house , and put his lunch bag down on the door-step . " Who says I want to move ? " he said suddenly . " We 've sold the house , " said Rivka . " But I want to stay here . " " Look , " said Erlich , " we 're not forcing you . Just offering to take you with us . " Tuvia sat down on the step . He watched the movers arranging the crates on the back of the truck . One of the men took off his shirt and hung it on the frame . His broad shoulders , bulging out of his undershirt , glistened with sweat . Erlich 's Morris was standing outside the yard , and Tuvia heard the engine running . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking toward him . Tuvia stood up , wiped the beads of sweat off his forehead with his hand , and said : " Do n't be angry , but I 'm staying here . I 've got a job , and I 've got plans . I ca n't come with you . "  | His mother , who overheard him from the empty kitchen , stuck her head out of the window and said : " Tuvia , " and after a short pause , " that 's just what he wants .... " But Tuvia did n't hear the end of the sentence , because his father said to him : " Come . " They walked toward the Morris , and one of the movers shouted at Erlich : " It 's Friday , Erlich , and we still have another trip to make from Jerusalem . " " Do n't worry , " Erlich called back , " I 'll be back soon , and then we 'll go . If the Sabbath begins , you 'll get extra pay . You need n't worry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they reached the main street . They passed the square and Kasos 's cafe , on the way to the Arab village . Yehiel Erlich pointed out the cultivated fields to his son . " Once they were Shuster 's , these fields , " he said , " and I worked them . " Then they turned off the road and drove between the Arab villages on the border , crossed fields , and Tuvia saw the quarries , the huge mechanical shovels digging into the rock , the workers bending over the stones and smashing them with heavy hammers . The road was paved with undressed stones , and the Morris bounced . " You made the right decision , to stay here , " said Yehiel . The road became sandy and soft again , and the wheels plowed through it . They bypassed the orange groves , the new moshav , and drove down avenues of cypresses and eucalyptus trees to the army camp . Tuvia saw , the long buildings with corrugated tin roofs , the brown huts , the  | rolls of barbed wire surrounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main road which passed through the center of the camp . Soldiers swarmed around the tents , raking the stone-bordered plots , sweeping the black road , polishing the windows . There were yellow signs with red letters on the fences and sticking up at the sides of the paths . A cart piled high with corn passed along the fence of the camp . The driver was a young boy who sat on top of the pile and made no attempt to urge on the mule . " My mare never went so slow . The road we 've just traveled in the Morris , I used to cover with my horse and cart . The stones on the road inside the camp , the stones of the walls it was me who brought them , a lot of them , anyway . With my mare . You did right to decide to stay . " They returned through plum orchards and banana plantations , and through the orange groves surrounding Noah Bulkin 's yard . The roads were growing quiet and the highway too was emptying . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beds with hoses , and children sitting with their mothers on the verandas . The Morris stopped outside the unfinished house which Erlich had begun to build for his son . " You 'll finish building here yourself , " he said to Tuvia . " And that Hagar you sometimes take out if you think she 's okay , in other words , a woman , you 'll bring her here . And now we 'll drive by the police station . There 's something I want to show you there . " They drove up the main road , and the engine strained , emitting a gray cloud of smoke which left a twisted tail  | behind it , writhing in the wind . There was nobody in the street , except for the shopkeepers standing on the pavements , letting the corrugated iron doors down over their shop entrances and locking up their businesses . Noah Bulkin , wearing khaki and carrying a knapsack slung over his shoulder , walked down the street . During this period , although he had already begun building up a farm of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand in one of the citrus groves . He walked slowly down the street , his head bared to the setting sun , like a man who knew he had no reason to hurry , that nobody was waiting for him . They passed a bare plot on which a couple of solitary rue had begun to grow , drove down a street crowded with low houses , one touching the other , and reached the police station . In the station yard too the Sabbath eve atmosphere was already making itself felt . The earth underneath the pine trees which shaded the yard was clean and raked . Two white lines shone at the sides of the drive leading to the entrance of the building . There were a couple of bicycles leaning against the gate , and prisoners ' heads peeped out of little barred windows on the ground floor . A last taxi drove down the road . A bare field with a knoll rising in its center stretched along the main road next to the police station . Erlich parked the Morris on the side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engine and stepped outside . Tuvia got out after him and followed him up the side of the hillock . When Erlich reached the top , he took off his flat cap . Tuvia looked at his father 's hair , which was white  | with vigorous strands woven into a kind of coarse tangle that shone with a peculiar brilliance . His father 's face looked a little different now that he had taken off his rap . It was bronzed , with a broad red band on the top of his lined forehead , in the place which was always shaded by the peak of his cap . His look suddenly seemed direct , and he looked without squinting at his son climbing up toward him . The sun was about to sink . The field and the side of the knoll were already in the shade . Only on the summit a few pale sunbeams still glimmered . A dry , uprooted thorn bush attached itself to Tuvia 's pants . He stood next to his father , bent over , pulling the thorns out of his pants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belong to me . From this hillock and all the way to the road . I 'm leaving you this too . The papers are all in order . They 're sure to build around here . But this area is right next to the road . If you want to do something , this is a good place to do it . " In the distance they could see the cypresses and the Persian lilac trees on the border of the neighboring village . Their crowns too were lit up by the sun . But now the light was slowly withdrawing , from treetop to treetop . And by the time they reached the Morris , everything was already a mass of gray shadow . Yehiel Erlich climbed into the cab on the passenger 's side . " I 'm tired , " he said to his son , " you drive . " Tuvia started the engine , and Erlich threw his cap down on the seat . He did n't put it on again . The movers worked quickly . They shoved the crates up against the cab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | the other , and crowded them together . Then they threw ropes over the stacked crates , sliding them through the wooden slats of the frame at the sides of the truck . " It took more than a few minutes , " said one of the men who had taken off his shirt . " Never mind , you 'll have less work to do in Jerusalem , " said Erlich as he got out of the Morris . " Unloading is always easier . " There was a bottle of cold water in the second man 's hand . The load was already shipshape , tied down with stout ropes to the iron hooks sticking out of the sides of the truck . Rivka , a large basket in her hand , was standing at the gate , in the broad shadow cast by the ficus tree . In her other hand she was holding her parents ' family portrait in its brown carved frame , the figures with their dresses touching the ground and their long beards blurred as if with age . Behind her , next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The new owners are only arriving at the end of next week , " said Erlich . " You can stay here until you find something . " " And where is he going to have dinner tonight ? " asked Rivka . Erlich went up to the movers sitting in the cab of the truck . He gave them a sheet of paper . " You can get going , " he said . " The address is written here . We 'll follow you in the Morris . " The truck moved off , and dense smoke mingled with the dust kicked up by the wheels . They could still hear  | the engine straining to get out of the sand onto the main road when Yehiel came up to Tuvia , shook his hand and pressed his shoulders to his chest . Rivka handed the basket and the old picture to her husband , went up to Tuvia , kissed him , and only began to cry when she was on her way to the Morris . The two crates of soda were still standing next to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Morris , started the engine , and drove off . Rivka looked hack and saw her son standing next to the fence in his stained overalls , in the shadow which covered his face . Tuvia stood there next to the gate , gazing after the receding Morris . The tailgate was open . His father had forgotten to shut it . It flapped and banged , and when the van had disappeared from sight he went back into the yard . He picked his lunch bag up from the step , opened the door and entered the empty house . The shutters were open and cool air streamed toward him from all directions . He lay awake , curled up under the starched sheet . The room was dark . His back was red from the sun which had burned it that morning on the beach . The starched sheet hurt him . The alarm clock rang . It was quarter to five . The ringing went on and on in the dark room , but he did n't jump up to stop it . He lay under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the alarm stopped ringing it seemed to him that  | the darkness in the room was blacker . And even the ticking of the clock was stilled . He went on lying in bed a few minutes longer , and then he switched on the light and went to shower and shave . It was quiet in the house , and apart from the splashing of the water in the sink and the scraping of the razor on his skin , there was n't a sound to be heard . He got dressed , and when he went out into the street it was already twilight . There was a light on in Sarah and Simcha Strauss 's house , and the streetlights cast pale patches on the sand . There were n't many people waiting in line outside the theater , and he bought four tickets and went home . Hagar was n't back yet . He switched on the radio , sat in the kitchen , and read the newspaper . He was hungry . Although the light was on in the kitchen , it seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood up , took some cold meatballs out of the refrigerator , and put the kettle on the gas . Then he put on the lights on the front veranda and in the living room . Now the whole house was lit up . He ate the meatballs standing up at the marble counter next to the sink , and made himself a cup of coffee . Then he took a few cookies out of the cupboard , and sat down  | at the table again . The radio was on , but he was reading and did n't hear it . The time was already half past seven . He reset the alarm clock and drank another cup of coffee . Hagar still was n't back . " She left at three , " he said to himself . " An hour to Netanya , and an hour back . Another hour , let 's say two , at her parents ' . Four hours . She should have been back by now . Even if she took the bus . " When he had finished drinking his coffee he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door , waited a moment , and opened it . Carmela and Yoel were walking up the path toward him . He showed them into the living room , opened the sideboard , took out glasses and filled them with wine . " Have you got the tickets ? " asked Yoel . " Yes , " said Tuvia , " I only got back a few minutes ago . " " Where 's Hagar ? " asked Carmela . " She should be back any minute now , " said Tuvia and took a sip of wine . " She went to see her parents in Netanya . " " Is it true that she wants to teach next year ? " asked Carmela . " Yes . That 's why she went . To get her books so she can prepare for the exams . She did all the courses but in the end she did n't sit for the exams . She has n't got a cer-tificate . " Carmela stood up . She had n't touched her wine . She walked over to the bookcase and looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung loose on her shoulders . She was broad , and her face was round and plump , with smooth skin and smiling eyes . She looked young , unlike Yoel , who despite his height walked and sat with a permanent stoop , whose hair was going gray at his temples , and who had a silver tooth which showed when he laughed . Above the bookcase there was a picture , a pen and ink drawing of a fisherman on the bank of a river . On the blue cloth spread over the low table stood an empty vase . " Where did you leave the kids ? " asked Tuvia . " Yoel 's mother 's looking after them . " It was eight o'clock . Hagar still had n't come home . " I hope nothing 's happened to her , " said Tuvia , in an offhand tone , in order to break the silence which had fallen on the room . " Do n't worry , she 'll come . Women are always late . " Carmela sat down next to the table . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Since Esther Schmerling died our son 's had a different teacher every week , it 's really impossible . Well , never mind , the summer holidays are beginning . " " It 'll be better for her too , " said Tuvia . " It 's hard on her being alone in the house all day . " " He understands , " said Carmela to her husband . Yoel was silent . He looked away , staring into the empty hall and the entrance to the bedroom , and then he said : " But you do n't understand , I think . " Tuvia got up and opened the front door . He stood on the threshold . " I do n't know what got into her today , "  | he said . He shut the door slowly , as if he did n't want them to hear it closing , and returned to the table . " You can go ahead , if you like , " said Tuvia . " You do n't have to stay on my account . I 'll wait for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll wait with you , " said Carmela . " There 's no hurry , we 've still got time . " " You 'd better go , " said Tuvia . " I do n't want you to be late because of me . I 'll wait . If worse comes to worst we 'll take the jeep . " " Take the jeep ? On Saturday night ? When you can walk down the street with her like a human being ? " said Carmela . Tuvia poured Yoel another glass of wine , but he could- n't go on sitting next to them . He went to the bathroom , combed his hair and washed his face . When he returned to the living room he looked at his watch . It was half past eight . Hagar still was n't back . There was n't a footstep to be heard on the garden path . " Go on , " he said , " I 'll wait . " " Come with us , " said Carmela . " She probably went straight to the theater because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no point in you waiting here . " Tuvia did n't reply , and when Yoel and Carmela rose to their feet , he rose too , opened the door , and followed them out . They walked along the main road , passed the deserted bus station next to the square , and continued walking down the pavement thronged with people . The shop windows were lit up , and neon lights shone above the new cafe that had opened on the corner of the street  | where the theater was located . Because of the electric lights flooding the street it was impossible to see any stars that might have been in the sky . And the stifling heat that suddenly descended on them made it seem as if the sky was covered with a thick layer of barren summer clouds . When they reached the theater , after stopping to greet various people on the way , it was ten to nine . Everybody began going in while they stood to one side , under the billboard advertising the movies that were showing that week . " Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , " said Yoel . " You 'll see , she 'll come . " " Maybe her parents delayed her , " said Tuvia . " It 's happened before . " They heard the first bell . Tuvia took the tickets out of his wallet and handed two of them to Yoel . They went on waiting next to him until the third bell rang . " Go on , go in , " he said to them . " Never mind , we 'll wait a little longer , " said Carmela . But a moment or two later she added , " Do n't worry , " and they went in . There was nobody left outside the theater , apart from a few latecomers hurrying up to hand their tickets to the usher , who was leaning against the side of the door . Tuvia remained alone under the billboard , with the naked neon light and the silent fleet of cars parked in the street . The usher left the doorway and joined Tuvia on the pavement . " Waiting for the wife , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when the usher returned to his post ,  | he stepped off the neon-lit pavement and began walking down the road toward the bus stop . Suddenly the street seemed deserted , and apart from a group of children running up and down and an elderly couple walking their dog , all he could see were the tree trunks lining the road . He walked along between them , and then he turned back . He looked at his watch . It was only quarter past nine . He saw that it was already dark in the hall . The usher closed the door and went to sit on a bench next to the wall . Tuvia went on pacing up and down the brightly lit pavement , until in the end he stepped off the curb , took a few steps down the street , and stopped in the shadow of the hedge surrounding the facade of the building . It was quiet in the street , and it was hot . He was thirsty . The Morris arrived at the new apartment in Jerusalem half an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and since there was n't even a chair to sit on , they returned to the Morris and waited for the truck . When it arrived the movers quickly unloaded the crates , carried them into the apartment , took out the furniture , received their pay and their bonus for working on the Sabbath , and left . Erlich and his wife went to spend the night with their eldest daughter . That same evening they paid a visit to Edna , who was living in Rehavia , too , and the next day , with the help of both their daughters and their husbands , they fixed up their new apartment , which was situated on the border of Romema , not far from the Mahane Yahuda marketplace .  | Erlich no longer worked , nor did he make much use of the Morris , which stood on the street corner , abandoned , until people thought that it did n't belong to anyone . They lived on the monthly interest they received from the bank , and spent their time walking around the Jerusalem streets . Rivka liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and going down to the ruins of Abu Tur , which reminded her of the ruined Arab village to the east of their old home . Erlich haunted the marketplace . He persuaded Rivka to do her shopping there , and he spent hours roaming around the alleys alone , late at night and in the morning too . They would wake up early in the morning and set out . Erlich liked wandering about among the crates of onions and vegetables , the heavy meathooks , and the paper bags scattered over the narrow streets . The torn bags mingled with the dry husks of the corn and rotting fruit which had fallen from the crates . " There 's money to be made here , " said Erlich one day , putting on his old khaki trousers and pulling the flat cap down on his head again . He checked the engine of the Morris , started it , and drove to the market . When he returned at the end of the day , he said that he had hired the van out to a hauling company . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . The truth was that he did n't have to do anything , but nevertheless , he got up every night and drove with the driver from the hauling company to one of the surrounding villages , helped him to load the vegetable crates , or the chicken cages , onto the van , and returned with him before dawn to the market , to unload the crates and distribute them among the stall owners .  | Once again he began coming home late and demanding food . When he suffered an attack of high blood pressure while unloading the van he took no notice , and after the second attack they brought him home in an ambulance , and he was forced to stay in bed . His blood pressure did not go down , and everyone knew that it could happen at any minute . His daughters came to see him every day . Tuvia came every Saturday morning . One Saturday he came with Hagar . His sisters looked at her coldly , and she put the bar of chocolate she had brought on the table without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes burned he seemed to exist in a twilight zone between life and death . The uncertain situation , the blood pressure which shot over the highest measure on the doctor 's instrument , started getting on their nerves . His daughters began to react with impatience to his few requests and to resent it when Rivka pressed them to visit as often as they could . He hung on like this for nearly six months . And then , one Sunday evening , when the representative of the hauling company came to give Rivka the monthly check , without any of his children at his side , he died . After his parents left for Jerusalem , Tuvia stayed in the only hotel in the town . There were no more than eight rooms in the hotel , only four of which were regularly occupied , and in order to add to his income the proprietor had opened a dress shop on the ground floor , next to the narrow reception hall . In addition to Tuvia there were two Arabs who worked for a local farmer staying in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government , who had come to supervise the construction of a new network of roads . Tuvia came there only to sleep . He worked overtime at the garage where he was employed and invested the money in the building of his house . For lunch he would buy two sandwiches and a cup of coffee at the stand next to the garage , and every evening , after taking a shower at the hotel , he would have dinner at Kasos 's cafe together with Noah Bulkin . Around this time Communist Party posters began to appear every morning on the electricity poles , and at Leibowitz 's barbershop suspicion fell on Noah Bulkin . " I saw you with my own eyes , you and your bicycle , " Leibowitz said to him once , while spraying his face with his favorite rose-scented aftershave lotion . " You and your crooked eyeglasses , " retorted Bulkin . But Leibowitz stood his ground . He sprayed another jet right into Bulkin 's eyes , and then he said with a sneer : " A private plot of your own . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all you 've got to do in the mornings ? Stick posters on electric poles ? Oh , you capitalist communist ! " But Bulkin only sniffed , and breathed in the scent of the roses . Nevertheless , Tuvia became friendly with Bulkin during this period . When they were tired of sitting in the cafe and watching the old men playing dominoes , or listening to Kasos 's gramophone playing the same old squeaking violin tunes which lingered on as a memento of Alexander , they would go to the cinema together . Once a week he would go to Tel Aviv to see Hagar , and from time to time he would go to Jerusalem to visit his parents  | and his sisters . In the meantime Hagar 's parents had moved to Netanya , taking their diamond-polishing plant with them . Tuvia helped them fix up their apartment , hammering nails into the walls and putting up new blinds . This endeared him to her parents , but Hagar suddenly said : " It 's not your job . You should n't have done it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her father gave Tuvia a big loan , and the building of the house was completed ahead of schedule . His sisters ' telegram did not arrive until Monday morning . It said : " Father passed away . Come immediately . " But Tuvia had already gone out , and he only received the telegram in the evening , when he came home from work . The hotel owner said to him in a subdued voice , as if he were trying to hide something , " A telegram came for you . " The telegram was open , and Tuvia asked him , standing in the dress shop which was still open , " Why did n't you call me at work ? " The hotel owner was silent , and his wife said : " We did n't want to alarm you . " After that she accompanied him to his room and told him that there was hot water in the shower . Tuvia threw his overalls onto a chair and went straight to the bathroom . He took a shower , but he did n't shave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and was about to set out , when there was a knock at the door . There were three people standing in the corridor . Tabak , Noah Bulkin , and the hotel owner 's wife . They were dressed in their best , and Tabak grasped Tuvia by the shoulders and drew him toward him . He wanted to say something , but his voice was choked and  | unintelligible . Noah Bulkin said straight out : " Tuvia , we 're coming with you to the funeral tomorrow . Kasos may come too . " Tuvia , unshaven and heavy-eyed , was embarrassed , and he smiled lopsidedly . He held Tabak and tried to embrace him , and then he held out his hand to Noah Bulkin . The hotel owner 's wife stood behind them , looking impatient . When they turned away , she said : " Another telegram came for you . " She held out the folded blue slip of paper to him , and then she took two steps backward , leaned against the wall , and waited to hear what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " According to will , funeral to take place in the village . Arriving immediately . Wait for us . " He was silent for a moment , and then he said : " I 'm going any-way . " But Tabak was more logical : " They may be on their way here already . Wait . " They sat in his room and from time to time the hotel owner 's wife brought them tea . Nobody spoke . When supper time approached , Tabak and Noah Bulkin left him . Tabak went home . Bulkin went to Kasos 's cafe . After a while Bulkin returned with two covered cooking pots . " From Kasos , " he said . There were baked potatoes and meat in the pots and hot coffee in the thermos . " I 'm not hungry , " said Tuvia . " You have to be strong now , " said Bulkin , but by the time Tuvia tasted the potatoes they were already cold . At midnight Kasos and his wife came too , and only after they had gone did he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't fall asleep , and he said to himself : " I should have gone to Jerusalem . " And in fact , the family did not arrive until the next morning .  | The sun was in their eyes , and Friedman the grave digger 's mare was nervous . She blinked her runny eyes , jerked her head up and down , and stamped on the road with her rusty horseshoes . The sisters supported their mother , who was dressed in black , her face crumpled and her eyes weeping . Tabak and Kasos stood by Tuvia , who was wearing a white hat with a black band on his bowed head . He refused to allow anyone else to fill the grave , and shoveled the red earth in all by himself . After that the cantor sang again , and Tuvia began to cry . Quietly , soundlessly , the tears flowed from his eyes . His mother freed herself from her daughters ' arms , went up to him , and embraced him . Hagar walked in the procession at their sides , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next to Noah Bulkin . " I do n't like funerals , " she said to him . Bulkin took off his cap and said : " Nobody likes it . But it has to be done . " A low mound of earth rose on the grave , and one of the gravediggers stuck a white wooden sign with black letters on it into the mound . Hagar went up to Tuvia and his mother and took their hands in hers . They sat shivah in Jerusalem , in their mother 's apartment . There were no new friends and neighbors to pay them condolence calls , but a few delegates came from the village , and Hagar came every day with her parents . They got married two months later , in Netanya , and went to live in the hotel . A few weeks after that they moved into their new house , although the walls were not yet painted and the doors of the built-in cupboards had not yet been fitted . There were shutters on the windows  | but no window frames or windowpanes . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house . " Are n't you cold ? " the workers asked them . But it was summer , and the breeze which came in through the slats of the shutters at night caressed their skin and their souls . " Mother 's miserable all alone in that big apartment , " Tuvia 's sister wrote to him . " Sometimes she babysits for Chaya 's little girl , and sometimes she comes to me and makes Friday night dinner for us . But the apartment 's too big for her and she 's lonely . I think we should do some-thing . " Tuvia and Hagar understood that his sisters were hinting that they should invite their mother to come and stay with them . And Hagar wrote : " We would be very happy to have her with us for a while . Soon the workers will finish fitting all the doors and windows . And then they 'll have to tile the walls in the kitchen and the bathroom . The garden 's already looking lovely , Tuvia works in it every Saturday . We 've planted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As soon as the house is ready we 'll invite Mother to come to us for a long stay . It 's summer now , and the weather here is very pleasant . I think she 'll be glad to come . " The reply to this letter came after the shutters and window frames in their house had already been painted pale green , and the workers were coming every morning to lay the white tiles in the bathroom . " Mother 's feeling better now , " wrote Edna . " She 's met a distant relative of Chaya 's husband , a childless widower , and they go out  | together . They go to listen to lectures and to see plays in Yiddish , when there are any . Whenever Chaya asks her to come and babysit she comes . But she has to be asked . Maybe we 'll all come and visit you over Rosh Hashana . And Mother may stay on for the whole of the holiday season . " Two weeks after a Sabbath visit Tuvia and Hagar paid the family in Jerusalem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a tall , thin , shriveled man who worked as a clerk in the municipality , they received another letter : " Mother 's getting married . Both of us think it will be good for her . It 's hard for a woman of her age to be alone , especially in a big , empty apartment . Now she 'll have someone to look after , and she 'll feel better . " Rivka and her new husband spent the holiday season with Tuvia and Hagar in their new house . Rivka 's new husband proved to be an interesting man to talk to . His voice trembled slightly , but he had an opinion about everything under the sun , and when they went for a walk together in the surrounding countryside it turned out that he had once spent the winter in a neighboring village , working as a carpenter in the citrus-packing plant . On the wall over the kitchen cupboard hung a picture of Tuvia 's parents . Rivka and Yehiel Erlich . One evening his mother 's new husband looked at the picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once . He was a cart-driver , right ? " " Has n't she come yet ? " Yoel came out of the hall , crossed the lighted pave-  | ment , and stopped next to the row of cars parked in the street . He saw Tuvia standing in the shadow of the tall bushes planted round the theater . Tuvia turned round and saw Yoel 's silhouette . " Has n't she come yet ? " Yoel asked again . " You should n't have come out , " said Tuvia . " Come on in . We can leave a ticket with the usher for Hagar when she arrives . Why should you miss the play ? Anyway you 're not accomplishing anything by standing here alone in the dark . " A taxi drove past them and stopped outside the theater . Three people got out of it , a couple and a single man . They made haste to pay the driver and handed their tickets to the usher . The taxi disappeared , leaving the street deserted between its silent guard of parked cars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tuvia . " So she did n't come ? " asked the usher . " She 'll be late , " said Tuvia , giving him Hagar 's ticket . " Keep it , and let her in when she arrives . " " I do n't need the ticket , " said the usher , handing it back to Tuvia without tearing off the stub . " I know her . " As they passed between the rows of people they heard the voices of the actors , dressed up as wretched down-and-outs , moving around the stage . " She 's always doing this , " Tuvia blurted out as they sat down next to Carmela . " Never mind , " whispered Yoel , " these things happen . " They sat in silence and watched the play . From time to time Tuvia turned his head back and  | shifted in his seat . He was tired and he could n't concentrate on what the actors were saying . The sets were drab too , and did not catch his attention . He did n't understand the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first act , when the curtains slowly closed and met in the middle of the stage . " She wo n't come now , " he whispered quickly to Yoel sitting next to him , looking at the empty stage and clapping his hands . Together with the rest of the audience they went outside for the intermission . As they passed the usher , Tuvia said to him : " I do n't think she 'll be coming . " But nevertheless , the three of them left the theater and walked down the street as far as the billboard on the corner . A young motorcyclist drove past them , but the street was deserted . They were late for the second act too , but suddenly Tuvia began to concentrate on what was happening on the stage . A father was visiting his son in a jailyard . Afterward , Tuvia remembered one sentence which the father said to his son : " No one will ever give me back the peace of mind you robbed me of . " The son was silent and the father leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the play he joined in the applause , but when they went out into the street he retreated into silence . " We 'll walk you home , " said Carmela . " There 's no need , " said Tuvia . " She probably came back late and stayed at home . " They walked among the crowds thronging the street . A few cars , their headlights on , nosed their way slowly  | through the people , who were pushed to the sides of the road . Next to the square , between the taxi stand and Kasos 's well-lit cafe , they stopped . " Good night , " said Carmela . " That 's it . So tomorrow morning it 's back to work again . We have to finish with those Tnuva vans , " said Yoel . He shook Tuvia 's hand and then put his arm around Carmela 's shoulder . They walked away . Alone Tuvia entered the street . There was no one else in it . Sarah and Simcha Strauss 's house was dark . So was his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dewdrops glittered on the windows of the jeep . Hagar was n't back yet . He took the key from the windowsill and went inside . On the table in the living room stood the wineglasses . Two empty glasses and one half full Carmela 's . He drank a glass of cold water in the kitchen , and then he went into the bedroom and took the cover off the bed . Before he lay down to sleep , he took the theater ticket with the stub , Hagar 's ticket , out of his pocket and put it on the table . The sun blazed . There was nobody in the square . Only the tall concrete column rose forlornly in its center . The door of Kasos 's cafe too was shut . In the distance , at the  | end of the street , next to the broad avenue of cypresses , she saw two children in white shirts . They were walking on the pavement in the direction of the soccer field . She walked slowly , but sweat was beginning to collect in her armpits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the road , she went to stand in the shade of a eucalyptus tree . There were two soldiers and an elderly couple standing next to the tree . The soldiers took turns leaning against the tree trunk . Occasionally one of them went to stand in the road to try to hitch a ride . A cab stopped . " Haifa , " called the cabdriver . The old couple got in immediately , and Hagar asked : " Can you take me as far as Netanya ? " " Get in , " he said . The soldiers remained standing where they were . The driver looked at them . " There 's one more place , " he said , " anyone interested ? " The soldiers conferred , and the cabbie began pulling away slowly . Suddenly one of them came running after the cab . The cabbie stopped and the soldier got in . " Haifa ? " he asked . " Shut the door well , " said the cabbie to the soldier , who squeezed in next to Hagar on the back seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldier sitting next to her . He took off his green beret and put it on his knees . His face was in shadow , squeezed into the corner of the cab . Hagar noticed the dried sweat on his tanned face , in contrast with his neatly pressed uniform . He closed his eyes and tried to fall asleep . She  | remembered the soldier she had seen next to the Arab village . His stained , patched uniform like a natural continuation of his weary face . She remembered his slightly crooked nose , his ungainly walk . It was hard for her to imagine him in other clothes . Without his equipment , without his steel helmet . He too was supposed to get leave today . He 'd said so yesterday . Would he too be wearing a clean uniform now ? What color was his beret ? Green ? Black ? Red ? Where would he go to spend his short leave today ? The soldier woke up and took a cigarette out of the packet in his shirt pocket . He opened the window , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old woman said to him : " My husband 's ill . Would you mind not smoking ? " The soldier took a long drag , stubbed out the burning tip of the cigarette , and put it back in the pack . She could n't remember if her soldier smoked too . At exactly four o'clock the cab stopped in the center of Netanya , and Hagar got out and went to her parents ' . The town was unfamiliar to her . She was already grownup when they moved there . She walked along the pavement parallel to the beach , and the waves glittered in her eyes . Then she turned into an avenue shaded by cypresses and pines . Something stopped her from going straight to their house . She went into a cafe and sat down at a table overlooking the street . The waiter came up to her . " Coffee , " said Hagar . " Iced ? " " No , plain black coffee . "  | She waited for the coffee to stop steaming before taking her first sip . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly , as if she did n't want to finish the coffee and get up . " Did you come alone ? " they would ask her at home . She would keep quiet , put her bag down on the kitchen table , and say : " Ca n't you see ? " " We can see , " her father would say . He would sit down at the table , put on his glasses , and read the Saturday paper . It would seem to her that the wrinkles around his eyes were deeper , and only his hair never lost its black color . He would be wearing a white shirt and shorts . The shirt collar would be open , but there would be gold cuff links on the cuffs . He would n't wait for a reply , and he would hide his face in the newspaper again . " We wanted to come this morning , " she would lie , " but Tuvia was busy . He had to go around to his part-ner 's . They promised someone to have his car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Afterward they did the accounts . He came home at lunchtime , worn out . And he went to sleep . " " Do you want something to drink ? " her mother would ask , and she would hear the gas hissing under the kettle . " How are you ? " she would ask . But they would n't answer her . Her mother 's hair would be done , she would have it in a black net until the evening . " It was hot today , " she would say , and immediately add : " Do you know what I came for ? We 've decided that I 'm going to start working next year . "  | " Working ? " her mother would say . " At what ? " her father would put in . " I 've come for my books . I 'm going to take my teaching exams in the summer . And maybe next year I 'll start teaching at the school . They need a teacher there , and I need something to do . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " her father would say . " All right . " " Actually , that 's a good idea , " he would add . " But you should think about a family as well . Getting married is n't enough . " The coffee would already be on the table , and next to it a tray with assorted cookies and apples . Her father would put the newspaper down and peel an apple . " Parents always nag , " her father would go on . " It 's nothing to get upset about . They 're never satisfied . First they want their children to be educated . Then they want them to have families . In other words , to bring children into the world . That 's the way things are . " " So I 've come to get my books , " Hagar would repeat . She would take a bite of the apple cake , take a sip of coffee to get rid of the taste of the cake , and say : " You 've worried enough . Why should you suffer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to keep their mouths shut . We 've never been good at that . " " Leave her alone , " her mother would say . " She 's hardly arrived and you 're getting started with her al-ready . " Afterward they would go to look for the books and  | notebooks . When she had left home she put them in the closet in her room . Where were they now ? Had they moved them into the moldy storage loft over the bath-room ? A young couple came into the cafe and sat down next to Hagar . The waiter turned to them , but Hagar beckoned him with her hand . She paid the bill , picked up her hag , smoothed down her hair and left . She walked along the shady avenue , and turned left into one of the side streets . The entrance to the building was decorated with two creepers . She walked up to the second floor and knocked on the door . She knocked twice , but there was no reply . She pressed the bell . The ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no reply . She rummaged in her bag and found the key to the apartment . She glanced around quickly , as if she felt uneasy about something , and opened the door . The shutters were closed . She tiptoed to her parents ' bedroom . The door was closed . She stopped outside it and reached for the doorknob . Slowly she turned it , and opened the door . The hinges were oiled and they did n't creak . The room was empty . The bed was made . The closet was shut . The books on the night table next to the bed were closed too . Her parents were n't at home . She felt faintly disappointed and sat down on the bed . Her legs and back ached with weariness . She lay down , and the darkness made her close her eyes . For a moment she forgot herself and fell asleep . But immediately she started up into a sitting position again . She left the bedroom and went to the kitchen . She put her bag on the table and  | looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it . There were black coffee dregs in the cup nearest the tap . She went into the bathroom and washed her face . On the hooks behind the door she saw her parents ' damp swimsuits . Refreshed by the cold water , she went back into the kitchen . She put the kettle on to boil and in the meantime she washed the few dishes in the sink . Transparent drops of water dripped off her wet hands . She felt like having something cold to drink . She switched off the gas and went over to the refrigerator . She found some stewed plum juice and drank a few spoonfuls . Then she went to her old room . Her bed was in its old place under the window . But her wardrobe was full of bed linen , sheets and pillowcases , old blankets . The books were no longer there . Her old desk was empty too , although the blue globe standing on the corner was clean and free of dust . A white lace curtain covered the window . Next to it hung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main road , against a background of the eucalyptus and the garage . She remembered that there was no picture of her parents hanging on the walls of her own house . Only one of Tuvia 's parents , and suddenly she felt Yehiel Erlich 's eyes fixed on her with their strange , sly squint . She returned to the bathroom and looked up at the loft . It was covered with a coarse curtain . She needed a ladder to climb up and look inside it , to find her books . But the ladder was on the balcony , and she felt faint at the thought of dragging it to the bathroom , setting it up ,  | climbing the rungs and rummaging through the piles of junk in the close , stifling air of the loft . She returned to the kitchen , sat down at the table and went on sipping the plum juice . She washed the glass , dried it and put it back in the cupboard . Then she opened one of the drawers in the dresser , took out paper and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents . It was half past five . When she returned to the avenue she felt faint again , and she only recovered when she reached the street parallel to the beach where a refreshing breeze was blowing from the sea . The waves glittered in the sun and a muffled roar , of the waves and the crowds , rose in her ears . At the central bus station she thought she saw her parents coming out of a small cafe . She turned her face to a display window full of dresses , lingered there for a minute , and went on walking . At the Tel Aviv bus stop she paused but she did n't buy a ticket at the booth , and after standing in line for a few minutes , she suddenly walked away . She walked along the platform , and then she went back to the booth , bought a ticket , returned to the line and took up her place at the end of it . " You were standing behind me , " said a woman at the front of the line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " thank you . " The road wound between the dunes beside the sea . But the buildings lining the road grew imperceptibly taller , and suddenly she was in Tel Aviv . The bus drove slowly into the maze of the central bus station . People rose from  | their places and pushed toward the door . Hagar remained seated . Her head was pressed against the window . " Are n't you getting off ? " asked the driver . He looked into the mirror set above the window in front of him . He smiled . The bus was already empty . She was embarrassed . She smiled , but did n't say anything . She stood up , straightened her skirt , and stepped onto the pavement . The bus drove into the parking lot . All of a sudden she was in the middle of a crowd . People streamed past her . They all seemed to know where they were going . She moved slowly , but the stream into which she had been cast thrust her forward . Where to , she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and stood between two cars parked at the side of the road . Then she went down an alley which led her toward the railway station . From there , by a narrow side street , she reached Allenby Street , and joined the crowds streaming toward Mograbi . People jostled her , and her feet were wet with sweat . She wanted to rest , but the benches lining the sidewalks were full . Finally she found a bench in a boulevard crossing Allenby Street . There was a woman in a black dress and a hat decorated with flowers sitting on the edge of the bench . A gilt-topped cane was leaning against the slats of the bench , and the old woman 's hand was clutching a leather leash attached to the collar of a wellgroomed , curly white puppy . On the other side of the boulevard dance music blared from a cellar . It was getting dark , and boys and girls filed  | into the passage at the entrance to the cellar . Two bouncers stood at the doorway taking money from the youngsters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were playing , and she hummed it silently to herself . " What do you do in Tel Aviv ? Hang around next to Mograbi . On the promenade . " This remark , which the soldier had made beside the stone wall after refusing to take the canteen and giving it to Yiftach , sprang up inside her . She had lost the image of his face she did n't know if she would recognize him if she saw him in the street . She stood up . The old woman next to her remained seated while the little dog scurried around her feet . Again she was part of the crowd . People streamed past her in different directions , brushing against her body . She stepped into the road , and walked parallel to the sidewalk . Next to the traffic lights she saw a group of young men clustered around a stall selling drinks . Two soldiers were drinking soda . They looked at her . She did n't know them , but without her willing it , her eyes rested on them . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she crossed the street . The two soldiers walked past her . At first she saw them whole , but then they were gradually swallowed up by the crowd , and only their colored berets bobbed up and down among the heads of the people , focusing her eyes on them . " What do you do in Tel Aviv ? Hang around next to Mograbi . On the promenade . "  | Again the words rose up inside her . She wanted to go home . She looked at her watch . It was a quarter past eight . Late . Even if she took a cab . She walked down Allenby to the sea . The felafel , shishlik and kebab stands whetted her appetite . A smell of frying onions assailed her nostrils . Pale smoke rose from meat grilling on the charcoal fires . The sea was stormy . The sound of the waves drowned out the commotion of the street . She walked past the benches facing the sea . She saw the lights of Jaffa penetrating the waves , the lamps of a distant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next to the sidewalk . When Hagar stood still for a moment , the car stopped too . There were two men sitting inside it , and one of them stared at her . He made a gesture with his hand . She did not react . The car drove on . Between the little restaurants and stalls were the gaming alleys . Men pushed their way in , crowded round the rifles , the targets , the balls . At the entrance to one of the alleys she saw two sailors gambling with cards and dice . The cards were lying on an upended barrel . A short , skinny , unshaven man shook the dice in a round tin cup . " Place your bets ! " he shouted . The sailors put down bills on the upturned cards , the skinny man threw the dice on the barrel . One of the sailors picked up the money . There were pictures of playing cards on the dice . At the corner of the promenade she saw another upended barrel with cards lying faceup on its surface . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side  | street leading to Mograbi . " Place your bets ! One lira ! Two ! Five ! Place your bets ! Your luck 's laughing today ! " Shortly afterward she heard a cry : " Police ! " She stopped and turned her head . The man standing next to the barrel had turned it quickly over . He put the dice in his pocket and divided the money among the gamblers . Suddenly she began to run . She saw two women walking slowly in the middle of the alley . When they saw her running , they disappeared quickly into the dark stairwells of the buildings lining the alley . She looked behind her again . There was nobody behind her and she slowed down . She was breathing heavily . She was sweating , and opposite a round bulletin board she stopped . She leaned against the pillar with the notices stuck on it , took a handkerchief out of her bag , and wiped her forehead . An army jeep drove down the street . The jeep stopped next to her , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . Her hair was disheveled and it seemed to her that her mascara was smudged too . She had a little mirror in her bag , but she was afraid to stand under a streetlight to look in it . She wanted to go into a cafe , but she was drawn toward Mograbi instead . She looked at the advertisements for the movie that was playing at the cinema . The box office was closed . A young boy with red hair was sitting on the railing outside the box office . She looked at him , and he jumped down and said : " You want tickets ? " She did n't take in what he said .  | " Come on , " he said . " If you want tickets , it 's over here , in the corner . " She stayed where she was . " I 'll show you , " he said and started walking away . She followed him . They crossed an open courtyard and entered a basement lit by a number of oil lamps . Two men with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selling tickets . " It 's here , " said the boy and walked off . The walls of the basement were unpainted and through the thin plaster the outlines of the bricks were visible . She had a five lira note in her hand . Someone pushed a ticket into her hand , took the money with rough fingers , and dropped the change into her open palm . She went on standing next to the door , counted the change , and stared at the oil lamps which were standing on a row of wooden boxes stacked against the wall . She returned to the Mograbi steps , climbed up to the glass doors , and gave her ticket to the doorman . Then she went down to the bathrooms , combed her hair , and put fresh mascara on her eyelashes . She discovered a stain on her dress . She wet the place with water , rubbed it , and waited . The wet spot dried , but the stain was still there . When she entered the hall it seemed to her that everyone could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her bag , and kept her bag over it until she found her place at the end of a row , next to the wall , and sat down . She did- n't pay any attention to the woman sitting next to her . She did n't pay any particular attention to the movie  | either , which seemed to her to go on forever . The colors danced in front of her eyes , her head ached . Little by little she settled down and forgot that she was far from home , in a strange movie theater , by herself . When the movie ended she felt her strength returning , and she turned again in the direction of the promenade . A strong wind was blowing from the sea , and people were leaving the sidewalks , going into cafes , restaurants , gaming alleys . Next to one of the upended barrels she saw a group of soldiers . " Place your bets ! " the voice of the man in charge of the game rose above the wind . She approached . " Hey , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook the dice . " Put your money down ! Put down a lira ! Put down five ! Put your money down ! " She skirted the group of soldiers crowding around the barrel . She saw a man come running out of the cafe behind them , and averted her eyes and looked at the soldiers . From behind they looked exactly alike . It was hard for her to distinguish among them . The man who had emerged from the restaurant pushed his way through the people crowding under the awning . When he came face-to-face with her he stood stock-still . " Hagar , " he cried , " Hagar , what are you doing here ? " She stepped back . She did n't say a word . Opposite her , in a pressed suit and tousled hair , stood Noah Bulkin.  | The main street was dark and deserted . The streetlights had already gone out , and a dull gleam rose from the black asphalt and spread over the sidewalks . The headlights of the cab shone on the road and wiped away the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the motor was barely audible , and the car seemed to be gliding , sliding down the road of its own accord . The cab drove around the square and stopped next to the sidewalk opposite Kasos 's cafe . When the cab stopped its lights went off . The door opened , and a woman stepped out . " Are n't you afraid of walking home by yourself ? " asked the cabdriver . " No . Thank you , " replied the woman . She straightened her dress and began walking along the sidewalk . The headlights of the cab , which had come on again , lit up her figure . Then a dull roar interrupted the silence of the night and the cab backed away . The beams of light retreated too , and the woman walking in them looked as if she were walking to the end of the light and then stepping outside it . When she emerged from the ficus avenue she turned into a narrow path winding between two wooden fences which led to her house . There was a pale light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the houses were already dark and sleeping . Between the slats of her kitchen shutters thin strips of light flickered . The narrow iron gate was closed and wet with dew . She opened the gate  | carefully and for fear of the unoiled hinges creaking she did not shut it . A cold gust of wind hit her as she entered the yard and tiptoed across the stone path . Splinters of light from the electric bulb in the kitchen penetrated the slits in the shutter . She was afraid that the door would be locked from inside . She did n't want to knock and wake him up . In her parents ' home everyone had a key . Here they only had one key between them . Had he left the key on the windowsill for her ? She did that sometimes , when he came back late from Yoel 's place . She would open the window and the shutter , stick her hand out , and put the key under the tin can . She did n't try the door . She went straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand to the tin can , and felt the cold stone . The key was n't there . She wanted to sleep . A dull , unthinking tiredness filled her . Her eyes burned and she strained to keep them open . She wanted to sit down on the step for a moment and rest , but her feet hurried up the steps and her hand pressed down quickly on the door handle . The door opened with a creak . The light in the kitchen struck her in the face . Quietly she closed the door behind her . The wine bottle was open on the marble counter . A glass of water next to it . She put her bag down on the table and sat down . Her head dropped , and she held it up with her hands . She closed her eyes and tried to empty herself , as if passing for a moment into another world . It seemed to her that she fell asleep , but she was very aware of her hands pressing on her forehead . She opened her  | eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the closed shutter . Then she spread her hands on the table . Her arms were bare , and a breath of cold air from the window brushed them . Her fingers touched a dry piece of paper . It was the theater ticket which Tuvia had left on the table before going to bed . The stub was still attached to the ticket . The unused theater ticket woke her up . She snatched it up and examined it for a moment and put it in her bag . Then she stood up , went to the sink , and poured herself a glass of cold water . She took two sips , put the glass down on the counter , and returned to the table . The table was now empty . The ticket was in her bag . She picked up the bag and went to the bathroom . Outside the door she stopped . She returned to the kitchen table , took out the ticket and read everything written on it : the date , hall , price , taxes . She turned it over and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into shreds , and quickly , with big , noisy steps , went back to the bathroom . She shut the door and again she slowed down and walked on tiptoe . Opposite the mirror she felt very tired again . She changed her dress for a robe , washed her face , and as she was drying it she saw the swimsuits hanging on the windowsill . Underneath them , in the corner , lay the yellow cloth in which she had wrapped the canteen . She fingered the swimsuits . Tuvia 's was already dry . Hers was still damp . She took Tuvia 's suit off the window , folded it and put it away in the cupboard . She was now wearing her robe and slippers . She put her shoes on the rack and  | threw her stockings into the laundry basket . All that was left was the canteen wrapped in the yellow dishcloth . She took it with her back to the kitchen . Then she went into the living room , switched on the light , and removed the glasses from the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the light , returned to the kitchen sink and washed the dishes . There were dry breadcrumbs scattered on the floor and she took a broom , swept them up , and threw them into the trash can . The torn theater ticket was now in her robe pocket . She took the scraps out of her pocket and threw them too into the trash . The bedsprings creaked . It seemed to her that Tuvia had woken up , and she froze in place . But the creaking stopped , and no more sounds came from the bedroom , not even the sound of Tuvia 's breathing . A rustle of dry leaves and branches came from outside the window . In the corner of the hall stood the sewing machine , covered with a white , embroidered cloth . In the electric light filtering in from the kitchen she went up to the machine , lifted the cloth a little and quietly opened the drawers . She took out thread , needles , a tape measure and a pair of scissors , and returned to the kitchen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took the canteen and the dishcloth , measured , cut and pinned the cloth . She was absorbed in her work and forgot that it was late at night . The noise made by the snipping of the scissors did n't bother her either . She was thirsty , and before sewing the sides of the cloth together , she filled the kettle and put it on the gas . The kettle was heavy . There  | was a thick layer of kettle-scale at the bottom . " I should clean it soon , " she said to herself . She made tea , squeezed lemon juice into it , and returned to the table . She left an opening in the cover and sewed buttons onto it so that Yiftach would be able to slip the canteen in and out . And so that he would be able to attach it to his belt she took a strip of cloth and made it into a loop . When she was finished sewing she put the canteen into the cover , fastened the buttons , and snipped off the black threads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark hall and looked at the clock . The dark hands stood at nearly three o'clock in the morning . She wound the clock and went slowly into the bedroom . Tuvia turned over , and she stood still , hugging the wall . Her nightgown was lying on top of the white summer coverlet . She bent down , reached out , and pulled it toward her . Standing next to the wall she put it on . She folded her robe and put it on the bedside cupboard . When she approached the bed and lifted the covers , the wind beat against the shutter . It seemed to her that Tuvia was awake , underneath the coverlet , watching her silent movements . She was already under the covers . It was hot . She lay on the edge of the bed , as if she were afraid to get into it , and she almost fell out . She pushed her head into the pillow and tried to fall asleep . Tomorrow she would give the canteen and the cover to Yiftach . It would be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She remembered that he had wanted to tell her something on the day when they had gone for a walk  | In the Arab village and the soldier had given her the canteen . Why had n't he told her ? Her eyes were open and she turned over and lay on her back . Although Tuvia 's breathing was rhythmic , it seemed to her that he was n't sleeping . He turned over again and lay on his back . She tried to squint in his direction . But from the far side of the bed she could n't see anything . If he had asked her anything now , she would n't have known what to say . The alarm clock ticked next to her . Tuvia lay on the other side of the bed . If he was n't sleeping he was thinking . Thinking of the questions he wanted to ask her . She was thinking too . But not of the answers . She was trying to make out the ceiling . Tuvia too , whether he was sleeping or not , had his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke " between themselves . She did n't remember when and how she fell asleep . And in the morning , when the alarm clock went off , she put out her hand to stop the ringing . She was too tired to wake up , and when the ringing was silenced she buried her head in the pillow , under the coverlet , and listened to Tuvia , who threw off the covers , sat up , put on his slippers , and shuffled to the bathroom . Then she heard the doors opening , the shutters rising , and the water splashing . When silence fell in the house and the roar of his motor died away in the street , she peeped at the clock . It was five-forty in the morning . At noon she woke again . She dressed , drank a cup of coffee , switched on the radio , straightened the house , and when the sun was in the middle of the sky she took her bag and went to visit her parents again . There she  | had lunch with her mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her books and returned home . The exercise books were dusty and yellowed . The pages of the textbooks were stiff , crumbling , unpleasant to the touch . They smelled of mold , and she asked herself how they could be revived . She left them open on the table and went to the village center . There she bought new ex ercise books , a pencil , a ruler , and a notebook . On the way home she bought food at Tabak 's , and when she walked past Kasos , he gave her a strange look . At home she wrote a letter applying to take her exams at the end of summer . She stuck a stamp on the envelope and went out to mail it . In the street her eyes were drawn to the ruined Arab village . There were no soldiers there today , but there was a red flag flying on one of the roofs . The mailbox stood on the corner of the street , where the sand met the asphalt . Children were running about the empty lot , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell him she had already sewn the cover for the canteen . She dropped the letter into the box . Yiftach was n't there , and she went on walking down the road toward the Arab village . She walked slowly , her hands empty . When she reached the place where Bulkin 's empty sacks were usually heaped she stopped . Now she had a clear view of the red flag , and she also heard the sharp explosions of the wooden bullets among the ruined houses . She went into the abandoned field . The donkey grazing in the field had freed itself of its tether and it trotted toward her . There was no one to be seen in the Arab village , and she went home . 4  | did n't leave the house again , and about an hour she found herself standing in front of the sink peeling potatoes , chopping vegetables , meat , and fruit . She prepared the evening meal , and while the potatoes were boiling she sat down at the table and tried to study . She had forgotten everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began copying its contents into a new exercise book . She copied in a firm , clear hand , divided the contents into chapters and paragraphs , underlining the headings with her pencil and ruler . After copying three pages and turning off the gas , she picked up a book and went to sit on the veranda . Evening was falling , and although there were no clouds in the sky , and the horizon over the rooftops was purple , it was chilly out . The children scattered and went home . The red flag was lowered . In Simcha Strauss 's house the lights were already on . Tuvia would be home from work any minute now . The cool air outside made her shiver , and she went in to fetch a shawl , which she wrapped around her arms . When she heard the noise of the jeep and saw the jet of yellow light touching the sand , she went inside . She collected her books from the table and put them on the dresser , next to the canteen . The jeep entered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She waited for him to come in . But he delayed , and she too began moving aimlessly about the kitchen . Only when she heard his steps on the veranda did she turn back to the sink and in a kind of panic begin washing a plate under the tap .  | Tuvia opened the door , came inside , went over to the table and said , " Good evening . " " Hello , " she said . She wanted to add , " Why did n't you come home for lunch ? " but instead she asked : " How do you feel , tired ? " " So-so , " he said . " Is there hot water ? " " Yes , " she said , " go into the bathroom , I 'll bring your clothes . " They did n't touch each other , and he walked with a heavy tread to the bathroom . In the meantime she laid the table . " And today of all days you made something special , " he said after they began to eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she lied . " I thought there was something the matter . I did n't know you 'd make lunch . " " I know . " " I 'm tired , " he said suddenly , " as usual on Sundays . It 's hard to get used to work all over again . " " I 'm tired too . " " I still have to be at Yoel 's for about half an hour . Then I 'll come home and we 'll go to bed early . " " All right , " she said . And then she added : " You see the books on the dresser . I 've begun to study . I sent a letter too , to register for the exams . " " Do you still remember anything ? " " At first I thought I 'd forgotten everything . I began to copy the material and it started coming back . I even remember the teacher who lectured to us . He stuttered a  | little , but he made sense , I think . " " Were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I have a key . " " But you went again today , did n't you ? " She said nothing . " Did we get any mail ? " he asked . " No . " " I 'll come home early , " he said before he left . And she was left with her books again . It seemed to her that she had n't been out all day , and the heat in the room made her feel languid . She took an exercise book and a texthook onto the veranda and sat down at the table . It was cool outside . Mosquitoes flew around the bare.lightbulb . A mosquito dove from the ceiling and stabbed her arm . She scratched the bite and went on copying . She wrote mechanically , smoothing her hair with her fingers . She felt untidy . She ran out of patience with the exercise books and textbooks . She took a book from the bookcase , but tired of that immediately too . " Have a little patience , a little fortitude , " she said to herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study . She could n't read . A few solitary lights were dotted over the mountains , on the other side of the border . During the day she saw the mountains as azure blue , as gray . Now they were invisible . The lights seemed to be suspended in the air . Suddenly she wanted Tuvia to be at her side . But before her eyes she saw the stooping soldier limping along the stone wall in the ruined village . She remembered the three soldiers who had looked at her yesterday in Allenby Street . If she had met Yiftach this afternoon , she  | would have gone to the Arab village with him again . In spite of the red flag . Tomorrow morning she would give him the canteen . What was it he had wanted to tell her that day ? She smiled to herself . The mosquitoes buzzed in front of her eyes . The dew sparkled on the bushes in the garden . She wanted to sleep . But when she heard the jeep coming down the street she opened her exercise books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything done ? " asked Tuvia . " Not so much , " she said . " I 'll read the paper first , " he said , " and then we 'll go to bed . You can take advantage of the mornings . " " Tomorrow morning I may go to the school , to see the principal . " He changed his shoes for slippers , brought a folding deck chair out onto the veranda , opened it , and lay down on it . The newspaper covered his face . Now she had to copy , but she was still doing it mechanically , without concentrating on the words . " Do you want something to drink ? " " Yes , " he said . She made cold lemonade , gave it to him , and sat down on the balustrade of the veranda . They drank their lemonade in slow sips . Tuvia let the newspaper slip from his hand and it fell to the floor . They did n't talk . He looked at her . She looked at the table , but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after setting the empty glass down on the balustrade and hearing its faint click that she rose from her place and returned to the table .  | " Should we go to bed ? " he stood up and leaned on the table . " I want to study tonight . " " You 've got the whole day , " he said . " Does it have to he tonight ? " " I have to start sometime . " " It 's a long time since we went to bed , to sleep , together . There 's always something . " She did n't answer him and he went to bed , alone . Later on she returned with her books to the kitchen , opened the shutter , and stood next to the screen looking outside , into the night . The day had already begun to dawn , but the house was still in darkness . A long horn blast rose from the street . The first to wake was his mother , after that his father . In the end he too got out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sarah opened the shutter and looked outside . The blasts were sharper now , and on the path leading to the house she saw Hilmi , Bulkin 's Arab . The honking stopped and was replaced by a soft knocking on the door . Sarah went to open it . The knocking too stopped , and only the muffled sound of the motor filled the cold , crisp morning air . " Good morning all , " said Hilmi.  | Sarah looked at him in surprise , and the Arab continued : " Is he ready ? " " Who ? " " Yiftach . The two of us are driving to Acre now , to buy horses . " In the meantime Yiftach had dressed , and put on his sandals , and washed his face , and he too was now standing at the door . Sarah looked at him . " Out of the question , " she said . " It 's true that his vacation starts today , but he ca n't spend the whole day wandering around in Acre . " The motor in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Oh Sarah , Sarah , " he said , " what 's the matter with you today ? In any case you 're taking the bus to Dr. Volowitz . Why should Yiftach spend the whole day on his own ? " " I 'm leaving him with Hagar . He 's not on his own . Where will he eat ? In a restaurant ? " Simcha , her husband , did not interfere in the conversation . They saw him going from the bedroom to the bathroom , and then emerging in his work clothes . " All right , " she said suddenly . " He can go . And you , do n't dawdle there . Come back early . I want him to eat supper at least at Hagar 's . All you get in those restaurants is fat . " They returned to the Morris , and Sarah remained standing on the steps , looking at them . Noah Bulkin was already sitting in the cab when she came up and said : " So  | at least come inside and have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet . " " We 've already had coffee , " said Bulkin , but Hilmi tugged at his shirt . " Yallah , come on , " he said . When he got down from the cab he saw Tuvia Erlich . He was wiping the dew off the windshield of the jeep where it glittered in the morning light . When he saw Bulkin Tuvia left the rag on the hood , walked up to the fence and called : " How 's the Morris , Bulkin ? " Bulkin said nothing . He turned to look at the Morris and seemed to nod . The Morris was gleaming in a fresh coat of green paint . The paint had been roughly applied , and the presence of previous layers of paint under it was evident . Bulkin looked back at Tuvia , and as if remembering his question said : " Okay , the Morris is okay . " Yiftach wolfed his omelet . Bulkin and Hilmi stood behind him drinking the black coffee Sarah had poured for them . Bulkin was wearing narrow , brown , corduroy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a flat cap . He was shaved and the rose-scented aftershave lotion flooded the kitchen . Hilmi was wearing a khaki shirt and trousers . He was unshaven , but he had a kaffiyeh on his head . Because of the stubble on his cheeks and chin he looked older than Bulkin although he was actually far younger than Noah . Simcha ate his omelet in silence . " I 'll be needing you next week , " Noah said to him . " What for ? " " I want to install electricity in the stable . In the shed . "  | " Okay , " said Simcha , " I can do it for you on Saturday . " " I have to wait until Saturday ? " said Bulkin . " A minute ago you said next week ! " " Yes , but I meant tomorrow . " " We 'll see , " said Simcha . He looked as if he were still half asleep . The old Haifa road was completely in shadow . Only high above , in the canopy of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chilly , and Bulkin had n't taken off his parka yet . Yiftach sat between Bulkin and Hilmi , and watched Bulkin 's hand changing the gears . The engine chugged . Hilmi leaned his head against the window and tried to sleep . Bulkin hummed a tune . " What do you need a horse for ? " asked Yiftach . " A mule , not a horse . " " Okay , a mule . What do you need one for ? Now that you 've got the Morris , why do n't you buy a tractor as well ? " " You 've got a head on your shoulders , you know that ? " said Bulkin . " But I need a mule . For plowing , and for other little things . Besides , I have n't got the money for a tractor . " " Have you ever been to Acre ? " asked Hilmi , suddenly waking up . " No , " said Yiftach . " If Bulkin agrees , we 'll go visit my family too . You 'll eat something good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the fishermen , in the sea . " " When has Bulkin ever not agreed ? " Bulkin stopped  | humming . " Especially when Hilmi 's got such a pretty sister . " " Uskut ! " said Hilmi . " Do n't talk about my sister . She 's not one of your girls . " " I 'm not allowed to say your sister 's a piece ? I 'm not the only one who 'd take her . " " You 'd never marry her , " said Hilmi . " I 'm not what you think I am , " said Bulkin . " That 's enough . Do n't make jokes about my sister . It is n't healthy , " said Hilmi , leaning against the window again and closing his eyes . It was hot inside the cab , and Bulkin told Yiftach to open the window against which Hilmi was leaning . " But I ca n't , " said Yiftach . " So wake him up , " said Bulkin . " This is n't a hotel . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hilmi , and opened the window himself . A cool wind blew in . They reached Haifa and drove along the bay . " Before we get down to business I think we should have another cup of coffee , " said Hilmi . " Okay , " said Bulkin , " but after business we 'll go and visit your sister . " " She 'll hide behind the curtain . " Bulkin laughed . Yiftach felt hot . Crates of vegetables , cages of chickens , baskets of fish . Dirt on the floor , close walls , narrow stone streets , shouts . The market . Stalls selling drinks between the crates and the baskets of fish . Stained rubber aprons on the fishmongers ' bellies . Little tables projecting into the street , and people sitting around them eating . A strange  | smell of the sea , rotten fruit , and papers littering the paving stones of the narrow street . Meat on hooks . Stairs . Children running up and down them , disappearing into dark doorways gaping in the long , blank walls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the crates , and the shouts . " Stick close to us all the time , " said Bulkin . " I do n't want to lose you . " Yiftach was silent . Frightened , he nodded his head to show he understood . Then Hilmi disappeared . " Where 's he gone ? " asked Yiftach . " We 'll meet up later , " said Bulkin . " Do n't worry , just stick with me . " The horses , mules and donkeys were standing in a big paved yard covered with straw . Temporary tin troughs were lined up along the fence and pails of water were dotted about . Bulkin and Yiftach went in and stopped at the entrance . The traders were grooming the animals , brushing their coats , cleaning out their feet , polishing their hooves . There were n't many buyers . Next to the fence they saw Hilmi between two horse dealers . " There he is , " Yiftach pointed to him . Bulkin slapped Yiftach 's hand . " Quiet , " he said . " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man selling nuts and sunflower seeds standing at the gate . Bulkin bought a quarter kilo of pistachio nuts , took a handful out of the bag , and gave the rest to Yiftach : " Eat , " he said . " Thank you , " said Yiftach.  | " And keep your mouth shut . " Bulkin spat the shells on the floor . Not far from the nut vendor , next to a break in the stone wall , lay an old man covered with sacks . Flies and mosquitoes were buzzing around his gray beard , and there was saliva dribbling from the corners of his mouth . Bulkin approached him and threw a few peanuts onto the floor . The peanuts fell next to the old man 's head , but he did n't wake up . " Look at that floor rag , " said Bulkin to Yiftach . They wandered around among the horses . " Have a look at these teeth , " an Arab horse dealer called out to Bulkin . " Gold teeth , " said Bulkin . " Thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Arab . " Come and look first , and talk later . " Bulkin did n't reply . " He 's looking for a mule , not a horse , " said Yiftach . " You , keep quiet . " Bulkin cuffed him on the side of the head . " Eat your pistachios and spit the shells out on these cheats and keep your mouth shut . " " Here 's Hilmi , " said Yiftach . " Why do you talk so much ? " said Bulkin . " You do n't know Hilmi , understand ? " Hilmi 's shirt was hanging outside his trousers , with a thick , brown belt fastened around it . He held a long stick decorated with stripes black as coal . A thick pipe was stuck between his teeth . He walked round among the mules , hitting them with the stick and puffing on his pipe .  | Bulkin and Yiftach approached the mules too . Bulkin went up to one of them , examined its legs , opened its mouth , and felt its white teeth with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said the dealer , a short man wearing a suit and a stained tie . " The day before yesterday , " said Bulkin , and glanced at Hilmi , who pointed with his stick at a young mule standing next to the fence . It was a brown mule , with a black stripe running all the way down its back to its long tail , which swept the floor . A bespectacled dealer ran his hand over the black stripe . Next to the bespectacled horse dealer stood another one with a gray mule dappled with black . Hilmi stood next to the brown mule and spoke to the dealer . Bulkin went up to the gray mule with Yiftach . " Do n't say anything to anyone , " said Bulkin . " Keep your mouth shut . " They went right up to the gray mule , and Bulkin began feeling it . " Good merchandise , " said the dealer . " It only got off the ship from Cyprus yesterday . " " Let 's have a look , " said Bulkin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealer haggling with Hilmi . " Only five hundred , " Bulkin 's dealer echoed . Bulkin felt the gray mule 's back , but his eyes were on the brown mule over which Hilmi was bargaining with the bespectacled dealer . The dealer 's eyes looked tiny behind his thick glasses . He was thin and his two front teeth were missing . His hair was combed back and he  | was wearing gray trousers and a striped shirt . His voice was hoarse and squeaky . " I 'll take it for four hundred , " said Hilmi . He lifted the mule 's tail , and stroked the long hair falling to the ground like a quiet stream , he felt its legs . The mule 's brown eyes were big and watering and mosquitoes clustered at their corners . " Four hundred ? Are you crazy ? " said the dealer . " This is the best merchandise you 'll find in the market today . " " Look , " said Hilmi , " a mule is n't a machine . Today you can buy a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where did you spring from ? " said the dealer . And when he saw that Hilmi was still hanging around the mule he added : " Get away from this mule . " " We have n't finished yet , " Hilmi persisted . " I want this mule . But not for five hundred . It 's not worth it . Look , " and he pointed to the mule next to which Bulkin was standing , " for that black one they want five hundred , and for this nag you want five hundred too ? You can have my hand before I 'll give you five hundred for this carcass . " " Carcass ? " yelled the dealer . " You 're a carcass yourself , you dirty Arab . Bugger off . Yesterday it got off the ship from Cyprus . Go on , bugger off , dirty Arab . Do n't dirty me . Go . I would n't give you this mule even for five hundred . Carcass ? ! Have you ever heard the like ? " " Stop calling me dirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and approached the dealer . " I 'm not an Arab and I 'm no dirtier than you are . That is , I 'm an Arab , but not the way you say it . And you will sell me the mule . This  | carcass is n't worth five hundred , and you 'll sell it to me for what it 's worth . " " Bugger off ! " yelled the dealer , and advanced on Hilmi who did n't even take the pipe out of his mouth . " Go on , bugger off ! " he screamed . " I 'll sell the mule to anyone else for two hundred and fifty . But not to you , not even if you gave me a thousand .... " " For two hundred and fifty ? " asked a quiet voice . Bulkin 's voice . " For a lira ! " yelled the dealer . " Only not to that dirty Arab ! " Bulkin 's wallet was already open , and he pushed three hundred lira into the dealer 's outstretched hand . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Untether the mule , hurry up . " He turned to Yiftach , who hurried to the post and untied the reins . The bespectacled dealer counted the money , and looked at Bulkin . " What 's this ? Three hundred ! Who are you ? Where 's that cheeky Arab ? " Hilmi had already vanished among the horses and people filling the yard , and Yiftach followed him , pulling the brown mule with the black stripe behind him . " You wo n't get more , " said Bulkin . " It 's a nice mule , I grant you , but it 's not worth more . " He shook the dealer 's hand , said " Thanks , " and walked away . " Crooks ! " the trader flung after Bulkin , but he could no longer see him . When he passed the ragged old man lying next to the hole in the wall , Bulkin stopped for a moment . The  | handful of peanuts he had thrown onto the paving stones was gone . " What a sly fox ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of peanuts to the old man . Bulkin reached the Morris and helped Hilmi load the mule into the back of the van . " Now we have to cut the tail , " said Hilmi . " We 'll do it at your sister 's , " said Bulkin . " In any case it 's a good thing you 're an Arab . Otherwise I would have paid five hundred . " Hilmi seated Yiftach on his lap , and they drove slowly down the narrow street , between the people , the crates , and over the little cobblestones on the street . Yiftach looked through the back window of the cab and saw the mule 's brown , watering eyes . " Look ahead , " said Bulkin , " at the road . You 'll have plenty of time to look at the horse later . So , did you see something today ? In life the thing is to keep a man to his word . " Yiftach turned around , and looked at the road in front of them . " It is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a mule . " They had lunch at Hilmi 's family home . His sister prepared a drink from rosewater , and his father took the mule behind the house , and cut its mane and bobbed its tail . " She 's pretty , your sister , " said Bulkin when they were on their way home . Hilmi was silent . And Yiftach , who could still taste the roses on his lips , said : " If I knew we were going to drink  | that rosewater I would have brought my canteen . " " You 've got a canteen ? " " Yes , " he said . " A soldier gave it to me . But Hagar is making me a bag for it now , and she took the canteen home with her . " " She likes roaming around too much , that Hagar , " said Hilmi . " But she 's pretty , " said Bulkin . " Almost as pretty as your sister . " " I 'll be back early today , " Sarah said to her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He went off to Acre today with that Bulkin and his Arab . Maybe it 's for the best . I 've decided to put the baby into an institution . Dr. Volowitz is right . I 'm just being stubborn . " They were standing in Hagar 's yard , on the garden path , next to the empty mailbox . Sarah was ready to leave , and Hagar did n't know what to say . But suddenly she blurted out : " Would you like me to come with you ? Perhaps you 'll need help ? " " There 's no need , " said Sarah . " Thank you very much . I do n't know what I 'd do without you . Perhaps I will come back late . Or even tomorrow . I 'll want to see how they look after him in the home . " She sighed and looked down at the path . " Look after Yiftach for me , " she said  | then in a quiet voice . " I should n't have sent him off with Bulkin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's not happy , " said Sarah . " He does n't play with the other children . " " He 's a wonderful boy , " said Hagar . " Believe me . " Sarah walked off . " If they come back early , " Hagar called after her , " I 'll go for a walk with him in the Arab village . " But Sarah was already on the other side of the road , and Hagar went inside . On the dresser she saw the canteen . She took it and went outside . She ran lightly across the dirt road and went into the Strauss 's yard . Sarah was already standing on the doorstep with the baby in her arms . She had a black scarf tied around her hair and the dark lines on her unmade-up face stood out in the sunlight . " I forgot something , " said Hagar . " I promised Yiftach to make him a cover for the canteen . Here it is , " she held the canteen out to Sarah . " Why do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and give him a surprise . " Sarah stepped down from the door . " Go in and leave it on the table , " she said to Hagar . Afterward Hagar accompanied Sarah on her way . " Is it from the soldiers ? " asked Sarah . " Yes , I found it . But they did n't want it back . One of the soldiers gave it to Yiftach for a present . " " I envy you , " said Sarah , " for having the time to go for walks . When I come back from Dr. Volowitz I hope I 'll have more time to devote to Yiftach . I 'll go for walks with him too . That Arab village is a wonderful place . I remember it from the time when they still lived there .  | We used to buy eggs there , and goat 's milk . " Sarah spoke calmly , as if she were n't carrying the blind baby in her arms . That day again Tuvia did n't come home for lunch , and Hagar once more received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tabak 's grocery store . Tabak 's wife hardly spoke to her either , and when she returned her change she did n't even greet her but asked right away : " Who 's next in line ? " But this time Hagar stared back at Kasos and went up to him . She bought a glass of juice , and asked : " Did he have lunch here again today ? " Kasos was embarrassed . He wiped his hands on his apron , took off his hat , exposing the bald spot in the middle of his head , and said quietly : " Yes , he did . " Hagar finished the juice and before leaving she said : " Then at least cook him a decent meal , not the same as you give everyone else . " Kasos advanced to the entrance , leaned against the doorjamb , and said , " You come with him one day . I 'm a good cook . But everyone gets the same . " He spoke loudly now , but he did n't see Hagar 's narrow lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitterness . She did n't go to the school or open a book the whole day long . She put the groceries she had bought at Tabak 's away in the cupboard and the refrigerator . She did n't cook , and for her lunch she had two apples and a cup of coffee . She tried to take a nap in the afternoon , but when she did n't fall asleep she kept getting up to look through the kitchen window at Yiftach 's house . She wanted to know if he were back . But the shutters were closed . and  | the yard was empty except for one big sheet hanging on the laundry line . The street was deserted too , the sand blazed in the heat . Even the children were hiding inside their houses or in the shade of the Pride of India trees in their yards . Nevertheless Hagar went out , with a textbook in her knitting bag . She went to the Arab village . Through the orange groves , along the path passing Bulkin 's yard . She was wearing sandals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sand that burned her bare feet . A hot buzz of mosquitoes rose from the grove , and the smell of wilted blossoms struck her nostrils . Voices came from Bulkin 's shed . The Morris was parked in the yard . A brown mule , its tail bobbed , was tethered to the electric pole . It was eating hay from a broad wooden box . Next to the box stood a pail of water . It was a young mule and it seemed to her that its eyes , in spite of the tears and the flies that filled them , were gazing at her . She went into the yard and walked toward the voices . In front of the door to Bulkin 's house , next to the can of glue and the red posters , lay a torn sack stained with dry mud . Bulkin 's black boots lay next to the dripping tap . Chips of wood , rusty nails and screws came flying out of the shed window into the yard . The window was caked with dust , and the nails seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Here 's Hagar , " called Hilmi to Bulkin . He came out and took up the rake leaning against the shed wall .  | " Hello , " said Hagar . " You 're back already ? " " Ca n't you see the merchandise we brought back with us ? " said Bulkin , emerging from the shed . His head was covered with dust , and he slapped his hands against his trousers to shake off the bits of straw and dirt sticking to them . " That donkey ? " said Hagar . " That mule , " said Bulkin . " Look at his tail , at the way Hilmi 's father docked it for him . You call that a donkey ? He 's not even a mule . He 's a prince . " He went to the tap and washed his hands , and then he held out his hand to Hagar . Hagar transferred the knitting bag to her left hand and gave him her right hand . " Where 's Yiftach ? " she asked . " What 's your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a cup of coffee . His voice was lower now , and slightly hesitant . It seemed to Hagar that he was blinking . " Thank you , " said Hagar , and smiled . " I 've just had some . " " You do n't drink coffee because you 're thirsty , " said Bulkin . " We brought pistachio nuts from Acre too . " " And where 's Yiftach ? " " He went down to the center , " said Hilmi , who had been leaning on the handle of the rake all this time and rocking to and fro on it , as if he were praying . " I think he went to your place , to get the canteen . But he said he 'd come back here . " " But the canteen 's not there now , and there 's nobody at home . I have to go , " she said quickly . And when she was  | already at the gate she called : " Thanks for the coffee . Another time . " Hilmi ran behind her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her . Hagar hurried home . She thought she might meet Yiftach in time to take him for a walk , as she had promised Sarah . But the road was deserted and their gate was shut . There was no sign that anyone had opened it . She went into Sarah 's yard . The laundry was still on the line , but the gate was open . The door to the house , however , was shut , and nobody answered her knock . She tried to peep inside , to see if Yiftach were there , but all the shutters were closed , and it was impossible to see anything through the slats , except for darkness . She knew where to look for him . There was nobody in the empty lot yet . She walked toward the Arab village , taking the path through the orange groves again , past Bulkin 's land . But this time she did n't cut across Bulkin 's place . She did n't want to bump into Noah and his Arab . She walked along a narrow path leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bulkin 's yard . The Arab was standing next to the electric pole . He untethered the mule and led it to the shed which had been converted into a stable . Bulkin was standing next to the tap and reading one of the posters lying on the ground . Yiftach was n't there . She stepped off the path , and walked through the trees . Dry leaves crumbled under her sandals , a stifling smell rose into the air together with clouds of mosquitoes . The  | branches scratched her arms and she walked faster . When she emerged into the field she breathed a sigh of relief , in spite of the glare of the sun . There was no red flag over the village now . Nor was there any smoke rising from the houses . She could n't see a single soldier . A truck passed on the road . In the distance , between the hills , lay a heavy , yellow haze . Was Yiftach somewhere in the village ? She decided to go and look . The shadow of a man flitted across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a loud clatter . She felt nervous about going on toward the houses and stopped at the olive trees . She sat down on the stones , put down the knitting bag , and looked around . When she heard nothing , she took out her work and began to knit . " Hi , you there , " she heard a cry ring out . She looked behind her , but there was no one there . She stood up and walked slowly toward the first ruined house of the village . A rough , broken shadow crossed the wall . Again she heard stones clattering and footsteps pounding on the sand . " Yiftach , " she called , " Yiftach , stop scaring me . Come here . " " Do n't want to . " The broken shadow vanished from the wall . " That 's enough . Enough of those games . Come here . " " I 'm coming , " said the voice . From a breach in the wall he emerged . In fatigues , but without any equipment . The soldier . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a hesitant step toward her , and then stopped . It looked as if he wanted to say something , for he raised his hand , but then he immediately dropped it again . Hagar shifted her knitting bag from hand to hand . She too said nothing , and looked at the wall next to which the soldier was standing . The sun was behind her , so that she saw her still shadow lying on the stones . A thin haze of mosquitoes emerged from the ruined house and flew between them , and Hagar began to walk along the tumbledown alley between the houses . She did- n't say a word , and the soldier walked behind her . " Where is everybody ? " she suddenly asked . He quickened his pace , caught up with her , and fell into step beside her . " There 's nobody here , " he said . " Are n't you training today ? " " Yes . But not here . We 've finished here . " She did n't ask him , " What are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes were on the stones scattered over the path . She walked slowly , afraid of stumbling , and saw the soldier 's broken shadow advancing over the stones beside hers . There were dead embers lying in the shallow drinking troughs carved out of the paving stones around the well . A bad smell rose from the houses and the dirty sand . They did n't stop there . They walked east . In the field of  |p166.  thorns beyond the village they made out a vague path . The thorns were high , and sometimes the soldier had to clear the way with his feet , with his hands . He would trample a bush with his boots , turn around and say , " Pass . " When the path became clearer and wider , she asked : " Where are we going ? " Next to the rutted road which led to the mountains on the other side of the border , they had to cross a deep ditch . The soldier jumped across and then stretched out his hand to her . She gave him the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slipped back into the ditch . " I 've grown heavy , " she said , as if to herself . " Where are we going ? " said the soldier . " Behind this abandoned moshav , there 's a side road that leads to a quiet place . We can go there . " The houses of the moshav were white and low . Their red roofs had grown rusty . The windows were boarded up . But some of the windows were open to the wind . The yards were overgrown with dry grass . Dry thorns tangled in the sagging fences . The main road of the moshav , too , along which they were walking , was eroded , with deep potholes gaping in the earth . The first house , next to the road , was not unoccupied . The yard was clean . A goat was nibbling the dry grass in front of the shed , and a big dog was running along the laundry line . But the shutters were closed , and the old watchman who lived there was nowhere to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling of loneliness flowed out to them from the empty houses . " So how did you get here ? " she asked .  | " There is n't much for us to do now . Next week we 're going south . For a month , maybe . And over here we 've already finished our training . I asked for permission to leave the camp , and they gave it to me . " " What did you do on Saturday ? " " On Saturday ? We had a half day off , in the after-noon . " " And where did you go ? " " What do you do on Saturday ? Hang out around Mograbi . On the promenade . " " You were there ? " " Yes . We even went to a movie . " " Where ? Mograbi ? " " No . Ben-Yahuda . " The road between the moshav houses ran in a wide arc , and when it veered north , they left it . There were green shoots sprouting in the fields which were plowed in dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knitting bag in his hand . At the end of the field was a low avenue of broad cypresses . Two palm trees and a lemon tree were planted among them . " I have to rest a while , " said Hagar , and smiled in em-barrassment . The soldier stopped . His face was turned to the east . To the avenue of cypresses , to the tall palm trees , and the distant mountains looming beyond the treetops . " Are we going to that avenue ? " she asked . " Not exactly . That 's only on the way . But we 're not far . " " I 've never been here before . "  | " Neither have I , " he said , " except for once . At night . We were coming back from an outdoor training session and we passed here . We stopped to rest in the place where we 're going . " They crossed the railway tracks . The dry furrows were behind them now and the ground was hard and smooth . There were grooves made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look behind her . The sun dazzled her and she blinked her eyes . " We 've already passed the railway line , " she said . " We 've gone too far , we 're far from the village . " " Not so far , " he said . " It 's the sun in your eyes that makes things seem far . It 's hard to see with the sun in your eyes . " " I have n't seen Yiftach all day , " she said . He laughed . " You know , " he said , " I thought he was your son . " " Do I look so old to you ? " " No , but I always saw you with him . Except for yes-terday . " " What , you saw me yesterday ? " " No , " he said . And then in a weak voice he added : " But I waited for you . " " For me ? " " Yes . " " Where ? " " In the Arab village . They let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd be there . " She was silent . " No , I was n't there yesterday , " she said finally .  | " And who is Yiftach ? " " A neighbor 's son . " " Was he pleased with the canteen ? " " I do n't know yet . I made him a cover for it , like you have in the army . But from a yellow cloth . I fixed it so he could attach it to his belt too . He has n't seen it yet . This morning he went to Acre with Bulkin and his Arab . To buy horses . I left it for him at his house . When he comes home he 'll have a surprise . Actually , he 's back already , but I could n't find him . His mother asked me to look after him today too . Poor woman . " " What 's the matter ? " " Her second child was born not normal . It looks as if she 'll have to leave him in an institution . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live alone ? " They walked along the cypress avenue , and their shadows impinged on the net of black stripes cast by the branches on the ground . Hagar did n't answer . The cypress avenue ended in a little orchard surrounded by barren lemon trees and pointed posts . Beyond the orchard was an old tarred road . Next to the road there was a sign which said : " Stop ! Frontier ahead ! " " We 've already passed the railway line , " she said . " Where are you taking me ? " She took a step toward him and laid her hand on the knitting bag in his hand . " Do n't be frightened , " he said , " it 's only a warning . It 's another four hundred meters to the border . " The sign was yellow , and someone had scribbled on it in white chalk . The letters were red .  | The road disappeared into a dense orange grove , and the soldier turned onto a side path leading to a deserted building , two stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the edge of the roof was a little swimming pool . The pool was empty . Rain water had collected in stagnant puddles at the bottom of the pool and the walls were covered with green slime . Purple flowers climbed the walls of the house and crawled onto the roof . Before they went down it seemed to them that they saw a figure walking along the cypress avenue . But a light wind had begun to blow at that hour of the afternoon , and perhaps it was only the wind moving the branches and playing with the shadows on the ground . They went down to the first floor . Colored tiles peeped through the sand , and dry branches covered the floor . There were some torn sacks lying in a corner with burned red bricks stacked on them . They sat down on the bricks . " I 'm tired , " said Hagar . She was leaning against the wall and closed her eyes . The soldier did n't reply . He examined the creases on her forehead . Her skin was pale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her cheeks and cracked lips . He put the knitting bag down on the sacks , straightened up , and Hagar put her arms around his fatigue shirt , dropped her head onto his shoulder , and wept . A bird perched on the frameless , shutterless window . It pecked at the stones with its beak , and then flew outside to the trees .  | " I have n't got any more strength left , " she said suddenly . Her eyes were dry now , and there were only two dark streaks , also dry , running down her cheeks . The room was stifling . They lay naked on her dress , which was spread over the sacks . Hagar lay on her back , with her head turned toward the pile of his clothes . His black boots were lying opposite her eyes . She reached out her hand and stroked the hard , rough leather . " I 'm cold , " he said suddenly . It seemed to her that she heard a stone clattering among the trees . She took his sweaty shirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and spread it over his back . The noise in the orange grove increased . Branches crashed into each other . Birds clustered opposite the window . Muffled thuds hit the ground . The soldier entered her . Hagar stroked the veins bulging on his neck , opened her eyes and listened . Bulkin and Hilmi put Yiftach down in the village square , next to the tall concrete pillar , where the first one to see him was Kasos : " Did they get something worth paying for ? " he asked . Yiftach , his tiredness showing in his eyes , said seriously : " A good mule , but they 're sly , those two . " Kasos , surprised by the expression , joked : " Nu , what do you want ? Bulkin is Bulkin . " He had a few pennies in pocket which his mother had given him in the morning , and he bought a glass of soda . Then he went to his father , but the shop was shut . His father had gone to one of his customer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to buy two bottles of milk at Tabak 's , and before going home he went into the grocery store and bought them on credit . As he approached his house he saw Tzemach climbing the eucalyptus on the lot and he began to run . He opened the gate , took the key out of his pocket , opened the door , and put the milk bottles down on the table . Right next to the canteen in the yellow cover which Hagar had made for it . He left the bottles on the table , picked the canteen up , took it out of its cover and put it back in again . He fingered the yellow cloth and felt the loop . " For the belt , " he said to himself . He went to his parents ' wardrobe , took out his father 's thick leather belt , and tried to put it on . The belt was too big for him . He looked for another belt , but he could n't find one . With the belt in his hand , he put the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the tool shed and rummaged among his father 's tools . He found an old scissors , a chisel and a hammer . He measured the belt around his waist , made a mark with the chisel , and began to cut . The scissors were blunt , and he beat the leather with the chisel and the hammer . Gradually the belt was severed . I72  | with the help of a screwdriver he made new holes in it and put it on . Hick in the house , he attached the canteen-cover to the kit by the loop and went to the sink to fill the canteen . he took a few sips , corked it , and went to the mirror to inspect himself . Then he opened the shutter and looked across at Hagar 's house . All the shutters in her house were closed . " Maybe she 's sleeping , " he said to himself , and wearing the wide belt , with the canteen bumping against his thigh , he crossed the street , entered Hagar 's yard , walked around the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no reply , he climbed down the steps and raised his eyes to the little can on the windowsill . He looked round . The trees hid him , no one could see . He overturned the pail standing next to the wall , climbed onto it , and held onto the windowsill . The key was there . Hagar was n't at home . He did n't know where to find her , and before going to the Arab village he decided to go to Bulkin 's place to show him the canteen . He did n't see the mule in the yard , and Hilmi , who was raking around the trees , asked him : " Are you looking for the mule ? " " I brought something to show you , " said Yiftach . " Come and see , " said Hilmi . Hilmi led Yiftach to the shed and opened the tin door . In the darkness Yiftach made out the shape of the mule . They went in , and Yiftach saw the wide trough they had prepared next to the wall , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had installed dripping into it and making sure that the basin was always full . " All that 's missing is electricity , " said a coarse voice behind them . It was Bulkin , who had entered the new stable behind Hilmi and Yiftach . " I 'll tell my dad to come soon , " said Yiftach . They went out into the yard , and sat down , all three of them , on the doorstep of Bulkin 's house . " Here 's the canteen . " Yiftach undid his belt and handed it to Bulkin . Bulkin opened the canteen , took a sip of water , and handed it to Hilmi . While Hilmi drank , Bulkin inspected the yellow jacket . " Nice work , " he said . " Did Hagar make it for you ? " " Yes , " said Yiftach . " So you met her ? " asked Bulkin . " No . " This was Hilmi speaking . " How do you know he did n't ? " said Bulkin . " And how did he get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Hilmi , " she came back . You 've got no eyes . But I saw her . She was walking on the path in the orange grove , and from there she peeked into the yard , to see if Yiftach was here . She did n't want you to go on nagging her with your coffee . Yiftach was n't here , so she went on to the Arab village , as usual . " Yiftach put the canteen back into its cover and fastened his father 's belt . Hilmi brought up a box from the fence , turned it over , and sat on it . Yiftach undid the buckle of the belt and put  | the canteen on his lap . They sat in the shade , and Hilmi said suddenly : " We 've done enough for today . I think I 'm going home . " " Just like that you 're leaving me alone ? " " Not alone , " Hilmi got up from the box . " With the mule . " Yiftach laughed . " I 'm going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " asked Bulkin . " To find Hagar . " " Go to the Arab village . She 's always hanging around there , looking for something . " Hilmi left . He disappeared up the road , behind the cypresses . " Run along then , " said Bulkin to Yiftach . " I 've still got things to do today . " Yiftach buckled his belt and walked toward the ruins . He did n't see any flag and he made straight for the middle of the village , for the well and the drinking troughs . He bent down and threw a stone into the well . Rings of water spread out to the sides of the well , carrying the slime and dirt with them . He opened the canteen and poured out the water . Then he looked around for the rope and the pail with which the soldiers drew water from the well . He found the rope and pail next to the stone wall , in a patch of thorns , hidden under a rusty piece of tin . He threw the pail into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water and did n't fill up . He tried to float it on its side , and when it failed to fill with water , he pulled it up and put a stone inside it . Now the pail sank into the water and when it was full of water it plunged to the bottom of the well , pulling Yiftach after it .  | He wound the rope around his hand , and with all his strength pulled the pail toward him . The pail was heavy , and the rope rubbed against the skin of his hand and hurt it . But the pail rose from the well , full of water , and Yiftach filled his canteen . The water was cold and he washed his face in it . Then he returned to the stone wall and hid the pail under the metal sheet between the stones and the thorns . " So that 's where they hide it , " said a slow , hoarse , slightly trembling voice behind him . Yiftach started in alarm . He turned round and saw the old watchman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the well . " I got hold of a pail and a rope , " said the old man . " but ever since the soldiers came everything disappears . Every time they hide it somewhere else . And now you found it . Good , good . " He cleared his throat . " Were the soldiers here today too ? " asked Yiftach . " No , " said the old man , " only one . " " Have you seen Hagar ? " asked Yiftach . " Tuvia 's wife ? " " Yes , she made me the cover for this canteen , see ? " And he put his hand on the full canteen , whose yellow jacket was wet . " They passed through the moshay . I heard them . Maybe they went on as far as the palms , I do n't know . But do n't you go there , it 's dangerous close to the border . They 'll be back soon . "  | The old watchman left . He crossed the stone wall , and turned toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old man vanished from sight , and then he crossed over the ruins of the Arab village , entered the thorn field , and reached the road which ran past the abandoned moshay . He wanted to go into the deserted moshav , but as he turned onto the dirt track which ran through its center , his eyes fell on a black spot in the distance . Further along the road , where it curved sharply and the white dome of a sheik 's tomb stood out among the eucalyptus trees , he saw Hilmi . " If he 's going home , " he thought , " he 's taking a long way around . " Then he entered the moshav and walked toward the avenue of cypress trees . Again the branches in the orange grove rustled , and through the open , frameless window , she saw a flock of pigeons flying up to the sky . " Should we get dressed ? " she asked . Hagar was lying with her eyes open , her eyes fixed on the windowsill . She felt cold and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell off . She heard a creak , something rubbing against the wall , and she saw fingers rising above the windowsill , clinging to the stones of the sill . She could n't speak . She looked at the soldier 's hair . His head was cradled in her hands , buried in her soft breasts . The fingers had already invaded the room . They were  | small and bunched , and gripped the inner edge of the windowsill . Then she saw the head coming up . " Yiftach , " she wanted to call . But he suddenly let go of the window and his head disappeared . There was the sound of a dull thud on the ground , a rustle of running footsteps and branches colliding with each other . Her eyes were remote now . The soldier sat up , took his shirt and put it on . " What 's wrong ? " He looked at her . She gave him his shoes and socks and then she too got dressed . " What 's wrong with you ? " he asked again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arm for a moment , said good-bye , and ran away . The soldier stood next to the yellow frontier sign , and watched her vanishing among the white moshav houses .  | " He was looking for you , " said the old moshav watch-man . Hagar met him on the main road , at the entrance to the moshay . His dog sidled up to her legs and sniffed her dress . It was only after he had repeated himself that she asked , " Who ? " " The boy . Did you meet him ? " " No , " she said . She smoothed her hair down with her fingers and arrived home by a side street . The key was in its place under the can , on the windowsill . She went into the bathroom , washed her face , combed her hair , put her hand on her cheek and felt the warmth of her skin . She took off  | her clothes . Her dress was creased , and there was a stain from the damp ground on it . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hot water tap in the bath . While the water ran into the tub , she soaked her bra and panties in the sink and washed them with laundry powder . She wrung them out and hung them on the line beside the window . She wanted to put on a robe , to go to the bedroom and fetch herself clean clothes , but the bath was already full and she got in . The water was hot and her teeth chattered , as if with cold . She turned on the cold water tap and picked up the soap . The window was closed and the room was full of steam . After shampooing her hair she stepped out of the bath and dried herself . She wiped the floor dry with a floor rag , put on her robe , and went into the bedroom and opened the shutters . The roofs of the houses were touched by a violet light . A wind blew into the room and she felt chilled . She got into bed , covered her head with the blanket , relaxed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room when she heard someone knocking at the door . " Who 's there ? " she asked , went to the kitchen , and opened the door . " Good evening . " " Oh , Sarah , Sarah , it 's good you came , " said Hagar . Sarah remained standing outside , on the dark veranda . Hagar stretched out her hand to her : " Come in , come in . I was sleeping . I do n't know what came over me . Come in , we 'll have coffee . " " Have you seen Yiftach ? " asked Sarah . Hagar appeared not to hear the question , and she said :  | " You 'll have coffee , wo n't you ? " " Yes , " said Sarah . Sarah sat next to the wall , her elbows leaning on the table . Her eyes were red , and her short hair was threaded with gray . She was wearing a black dress strewn with white flowers , and there were streaks of dried sweat on her neck . Hagar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into her coffee , and while she stirred it she asked again : " Where 's Yiftach ? Have you seen him today ? " There were veins standing out on the hack of her hand and her nails were carelessly cut . " Yes , I saw him , " said Hagar . Her eyes were fixed on the black coffee . " Would you like a little milk ? " " No , thank you , " said Sarah . " I prefer black coffee . " " When did you get back ? " " Just now , " she sighed . " That 's it . I arranged it with the doctor . He 's putting the baby in a home . There 's nothing more to be done for him . I wanted to go there today . But the doctor said I should wait . I 'll go next week . " The steam rising from the coffee covered her face . " I 'll have a little more time for Yiftach now , " she said . " I 've neglected him a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's only ten years old he 's not a child at all . He sits in the kitchen , makes himself an omelet , and eats it slowly , staring at the wall or at Simcha 's newspaper . " Hagar went over to the window and looked out through the screen . " Is n't your husband back from work yet ? " she asked Sarah .  | " No , he always comes late . But I 'm worried about Yiftach not being back yet . " " Perhaps he 's at Bulkin 's ? " " No , he is n't there . When I got back I met Bulkin . He was sitting in Kasos 's cafe . He 'd already changed into clean clothes . " The coffee cup was empty , but her hand was still gripping it . " He 's a lonely man , Bulkin , " she murmured to herself . " He 's a bit crude , in my opinion , " said Hagar , and she went to the window again and looked outside . Sarah rose from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm worried , " she said . Hagar 's lashes were streaked with sleep and her eyes darted round the room . Sarah closed the door behind her , and Hagar went to the bedroom to fetch her knitting bag . It was n't there . " How can I go back there ? " she asked herself , returning to the bedroom and throwing herself onto the bed . There was a sound of footsteps on the path . " They wo n't leave me in peace today , " she said to herself and waited for the knock at the door . There were tears in her eyes . But nobody knocked at the door . The footsteps were heavy and Hagar recognized them . The door opened and Tuvia came into the house . She wiped her face on the sheet and went into the kitchen . " Where 's the jeep ? " she asked . " Broken down . I left it at the garage . " " And how did you come home ? "  | " With Yoel . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cups were still standing . " Was someone here ? " He took a cookie from the dish . " Yes . Sarah . Yiftach has n't come home yet . " " I saw him this morning . Bulkin took him to Acre in the Morris . " She took the cups to the sink and washed them . Mosquitoes droned against the screen , trying to get into the kitchen . She left the sink and went up to the window . She hit the screen with her hand , but the mosquitoes stayed stuck to the fine wire netting . There was no one in the street . " Hagar , is anything the matter ? " His hand was on her shoulder . Hagar froze in place . She did n't answer him . Their heads were close to the wire screen and the mosquitoes . Suddenly she broke away from him and ran out of the kitchen . She went back to the bedroom . Tuvia followed her . " What 's the matter with you ? " he said . The room was dark , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the corner of the bed . It seemed to him that she was crying , but he grabbed her by the shoulders . " Answer me when I talk to you . Do you hear , answer me , what 's the matter with you lately ? It 's impossible to talk to you . Answer me . " She withdrew into herself , she tried to escape from his hands which held onto her tightly and would n't let go . " Tell me , " he said , " tell me . Things ca n't go on like this . "  | " Do n't yell at me , " she cried and pushed him away . In his work clothes he sat down on the bed , on the white coverlet . He let her go and rested his hands on his knees . From the kitchen came the sound of water boiling and food cooking . He stood up and went to the kitchen and switched off the gas . Dense steam covered the window , hiding the mosquitoes . He stood next to the sink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt heavy and his socks were sticky with sweat . He sneezed , went back to the bedroom , and put his hand on Hagar 's shoulder . Her head was on the pillow . Her shoulders shook . " Do you want something to drink ? " he asked . Hagar stretched out her hand to his knee . The material of his trousers was coarse . His leg trembled . He could n't control the trembling of his leg , and he took her hand between his . She sat up and embraced him . " I feel so bad , " she said . " Rest , " he said . " I 'll see to the food . You can have supper in bed . " She freed her hand and stretched out on the bed . Tuvia left the room . There was hot water in the kettle , and he made a cup of tea . Then he returned to the bedroom , carrying the cup in one hand and dragging a chair in the other . He switched on the light , pulled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it . Hagar was lying on her back . Her eyes were closed , and he put his hand on her forehead . " Drink , " he said . She did n't say anything , or open her eyes , and he went to take a shower . When she heard the water running in the shower , she sipped the tea , got up , and went back to the kitchen . She  | raised the lid of the saucepan . A smell of burned potatoes overwhelmed her . Her head ached . She drank a glass of cold water , got a fork , and examined the potatoes . The burned ones she threw into the trash , but when she tasted the good ones , she discovered that they had a burned taste too . While she was laying the table she suddenly felt weak at the knees . She sat down and waited . Her arms rested on the smooth table from which she had removed the cloth , and a delicate coolness caressed her skin . After the meal Tuvia cleared the table and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was nine o'clock . Tuvia was tired , but although he closed his eyes he did n't fall asleep . The gate creaked . Soft footsteps came up the path . In front of the door the steps hesitated and stopped . He threw off the blanket and listened . There was a knock at the door . He looked at Hagar , but she was asleep . Again there was a faint knock . He did n't answer . He got out of bed , and walked barefoot to the kitchen door . He switched on the light and opened the door . In the darkness on the veranda he made out Sarah 's short hair . " Hello , " he said . " Oh , I 'm sorry , " she said . " I see that you 're already in your pajamas . But I 'm worried . Yiftach is n't back yet . " " He has n't come home ? " " No . Hagar went for a walk with him this afternoon perhaps he told her where he was going . I 'm really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you think we should wake her ? " He invited her in . " I do n't know . Perhaps , if it is n't too much trouble . I  | do n't know what to think . I have n't seen him since this morning . He came back with Bulkin . He went with her . And he is n't back yet . I do n't know where to look for him . If it is n't too much trouble . " " Sit down , " he said , " and do n't worry . It 's the first day of the vacation , perhaps the children are out playing now. , , " I was at that lot where they play . There 's nobody there . I went round to Tzemach 's parents too . Tzemach was at home . And if that hooligan is at home , then none of the other children are still outside . " " All right , " he said . " I 'll go and wake her up . " Hagar appeared in her robe , sleepy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Never mind , it does n't matter , " Hagar yawned . " But perhaps you know where Yiftach went after you went for a walk with him ? " Hagar sat down at the table . Tuvia stood next to the door . " I 'm so worried , " said Sarah again . " He 's never come home so late . " " I do n't know where he went , " said Hagar , " but do n't worry . He 's a big boy . He 'll come home . He is n't with the other children ? " " No . " " So where can he be ? " " That 's what I came to ask you ! " cried Sarah . " But I have n't seen him all day , " said Hagar . " You told me that you went for a walk with him , no ? His canteen is n't on the table either . "  | " But I did n't go with him , " said Hagar . Sarah turned to the door and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you up . But I thought , I thought that you saw him . You told me that you went for a walk with him . Did n't you see where he went after you left him ? " " Ah , " sighed Hagar , " I really do n't know . " She went up to Sarah who was standing at the door , and took hold of her hand . " Do n't worry , he 'll come home , " she said . The door was open and the mosquitoes flew in and hit her in the eyes . " Oof ! " she cried , " Tuvia , why do n't you shut the door ? " There were tears in her eyes . Tuvia did n't hear her shout . He left the house , after motioning Sarah to step aside from the door . Outside in the yard he finished buttoning his shirt . He went out of the big gate , crossed the road , and knocked on the Strausses ' door . " Sarah ? " he heard Simcha 's hoarse voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " What 's wrong ? " Simcha asked as Tuvia came inside , his eyes red and his hair tousled . " Nothing , " said Tuvia . " I just woke up . Look , " he continued , " perhaps you should come with me to Yoel 's and we 'll borrow his jeep . It 's worrying . It 's already half past ten , and Yiftach still has n't come home . "  | " Ah , she 's infected you with her panic too , " said Simcha . " He 'll come home . He 's come home late before . It 's the summer holidays . But she does n't want to listen to me . " " Look , " said Tuvia . " It 's really late . I do n't know , but she said that she went round to Tzemach 's too . Even he 's at home already . " Simcha stood next to the table . His brown leather bag full of greasy , empty lunch bags and a few tools was lying on the chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his forehead was low and rough . He had n't taken off his work clothes yet , and his socks hung sloppily over his shoes . He mumbled something , picked up his bag and sat down on the chair . " I 'm tired . " He propped his elbow on the table and rested his head on his hand . " So you do n't think we should go and get the jeep ? " asked Tuvia . " Maybe we 'd better , " said Simcha . He stood up , went over to the window and looked outside . Then he went to the bathroom and came back in a clean shirt . They went out into the road and at the gate they met Sarah . " Is n't he back yet ? " she asked . " No , " said Simcha . " We 're going to Yoel 's , to take the jeep . We 'll go and look for him . " " I 'll come with you . " " There 's no need , " said Simcha . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be somebody to give him what for . "  | They went on walking , but Sarah came with them . " Go home , " said Simcha , " there 's no point in the three of us going , and someone has to stay home . " She went back and they walked on . Yoel lived not far from the garage , at the other end of the village . It was a small house at the end of a group of crowded apartment buildings . In the dark it was hard to make it out . " I 've never walked to Yoel 's before , " said Tuvia . " It 's as if I do n't know the way . " " I think the lights are off , " said Simcha . " Too bad , " said Tuvia , " we 'll have to wake them up . " " Have n't you got the key to the jeep ? " " No , I do n't need a key to start it , but I do n't want to give them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they heard a low voice . Yoel came out in his pajamas . He opened the door and put his finger to his lips as a sign to them not to make any noise . Tuvia and Simcha stood on the garden path . " We need the jeep , " said Tuvia . " Is there anything wrong ? " asked Yoel . " No , nothing , " said Simcha in his hoarse voice , " but Yiftach has n't come home yet , and Sarah 's worried . " " All right , " said Yoel , " I 'll come with you . " " There 's no need , " said Simcha . As they talked a heavy shadow fell over them . It was Carmela , who had also woken up . " Has n't he come home yet ? " she asked . Carmela and Yoel went back inside . Simcha and Tuvia  | , got into the jeep , which was standing in the street next to the fence . Tuvia started it . The light went off in Yoel and Carmela 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think ? " asked Simcha . " Do n't you know where he liked to hang out ? " " Hard to know . Once he came home late . Last week , I think it was , but then he was at your place . " " At our place ? " " Yes , with Hagar . " Tuvia drove the jeep to the school building , which loomed up like a dark fort against the background of the light sky . The hedge that surrounded it was still , only the little leaves rippling when the lights of the jeep shone on them . The building was dark , but in the schoolyard , beneath the pine trees , there were shadows of children standing around a bonfire . " He 's such a bastard , " said Simcha . " Sarah came home today worn out from the doctor , and that little one did n't even think of telling anybody where he was going , and when he meant to come home . I 'll show him . Wait for me here , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be back in a minute . " " Do n't make a scene in front of the children , " said Tuvia . " Do n't worry , " said Simcha . He took out a cigarette and before going into the schoolyard he lit it . In spite of the light breeze blowing into the jeep Tuvia felt tired , and leaned his head on the steering wheel .  | when he woke up , he saw the tip of Simcha 's cigarette rning in front of him . Before Simcha got into the jeep threw the cigarette down , and ground it under his shoe . " Did you leave him there ? " asked Tuvia . Simcha took the pack out of his pocket and lit himself another cigarette . " No , " he said , " he was n't there . " Simcha offered Tuvia a cigarette . But Tuvia shook his head , and Simcha said : " I forgot you do n't smoke . " They drove along dirt roads and circled the village . " They have n't seen him all day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't spoken to him . They said he went to Bulkin , or to the Arab village . To Hagar . " " To Hagar ? " " Yes . They said she always walks there . And he goes with her . " " But Hagar told me that today she did n't go for a walk with him . " " Sarah said she did . " They drove past the plowed field with the dry furrows , climbed the hill , and drove along the fence of the ceme-tery . " We 're going to look for Yiftach , " said Simcha , " but I ca n't stop thinking about Sarah . " The road was full of sand and Tuvia changed gears . The abandoned moshav was in darkness , only the white walls shining . A lamp in the old watchman 's house cast a pale light on the sagging fence . The dog barked . They parked the jeep next to the gate and went into the  | yard . The rope tied around the dog 's neck was attached to a high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barking threateningly . " Quiet , dog , " an old man 's voice roared . The watchman opened the window , stuck out his head and asked : " What do you want of my life in the middle of the night ? " " Have you seen Yiftach today ? " asked Simcha . " Yes , but a long time ago . " " Where ? " " What 's up ? " " He has n't come home yet . " " Ahh . . . " groaned the old man , " a fine kettle of fish . . . . " He vanished and they heard him call , " Just a minute , I 'll be out in a minute . " He came out holding a flashlight and wearing a hat and a black scarf wrapped around his neck . He locked the door behind him , threw a piece of meat to the dog , and turned toward them . " Women , women . . . . " he muttered and pointed at Tuvia . " I saw her today . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sometimes by herself . Today with that soldier who lost his canteen . They went to the ruin next to the palms . Yiftach followed them . I do n't know if they met . In the end she came back by herself . And him , Yiftach , I did n't see at all . " " Hagar ? " said Tuvia . His face was tight and his lips hardly moved . " Yes , your wife , your wife , " said the old man . He  | turned to the laundry line and untied the dog who finished gobbling down the meat . Then he scraped the ground with his paws , sniffed , hung his head and slunk after his master . " Come along , " said Simcha , " we 'll go in the jeep . " " Where will we go in the jeep ? " complained the watchman . " When you 're looking for someone you have to go on foot . Leave the jeep here , and come along . " " Maybe he 's already gone home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway ? " " Look here , " said the old watchman , " either you woke me up because you needed my help , or else you woke me up for nothing . " He pulled the rope he was holding in his hand . " Quiet , " he scolded the dog who had begun to growl . A smell of dry mold came from the abandoned houses . They walked toward the palm trees , whose crowns in the dark looked like domed sepulchres fallen out of the sky . The old man walked ahead , dragging his feet , and also the dog , who kept stopping to sniff at the stones on the road . " Do you know where we 're going ? " Simcha asked Tuvia . " No . " " Maybe you 're right , and Yiftach 's already at home . " " I do n't know what we 're doing with this old man ei-ther . " " He saw Yiftach . " " Yes , and he saw Hagar too . "  | They walked slowly and fell behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shed fitful beams of light onto the road and the deserted yards . " We are n't doing this for fun , " said the old man . " Get a move on . First you wake me up and now you 're dawdling as if you 've forgotten what you woke me up for . Oh , you youngsters . . . . " The sky lightened and the trunks of the palms lining the road marched with them on their way like a guard of honor . " Look , " said the old man to Tuvia , " they must have gone to the Arab house with the pool . Maybe we 'll find something there that will give us a clue where to look for him . He really has n't come home all this time ? " " Not up till an hour ago , at any rate , " said Tuvia . " Yes . It 's worrying . He could do something stupid . It 's difficult to tell where the border runs . And especially for a little simpleton like Yiftach . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 're driving me crazy . First the soldiers come to the village and steal my pail and rope I left there to draw water from the well when I put the goat out to pasture . And she takes the child for walks out here , next to the railway line and the border . What kind of people are you ? Where are your brains ? " " You said she did n't go with him , " Tuvia interrupted . " You saw her alone with the soldier . " " All right , all right . Yes . But I would n't have said it if I 'd seen you . I did n't see that it was you with Simcha at first . "  | " But she went with the soldier , right ? " Tuvia almost shouted , and Simcha walking next to him turned his head back to the white houses which looked gray in the dark . " Yes , " said the old man . " And that does n't add to your honor in my eyes . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Where are you taking us now ? " " Look at them , " said the old man . " First they wake me up and then they still ask questions . " They passed the yellow frontier sign , and the old watchman 's flashlight shone on the solitary house with the dark , green plants creeping over its walls . Jackals howled in the orange grove and fireflies glittered between the leaves . The old man released the dog , who ran around the house with the short rope trailing behind him . When the dog returned to the front of the ruin he whimpered faintly and his whimper sounded like a distant echo of the jackals ' wails . The flashlight picked out the doorway and penetrated the interior . In the darkness the dirt on the colored tiles was invisible , and the ray of light wandering over them only occasionally revealed a dry branch , a rag , a clod of earth . The beam slid over the walls and stopped in the corner of the room , where it hit a burned brick lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacks . Between the sacks and the brick lay a white bag embroidered in yellow thread . The flashlight moved away from the embroidered bag and Tuvia said : " Shine the flashlight on that bag again . "  | And when the light poured over the bag again he went up to it and picked it up and said : " Yes , she was here . " He opened the bag and put his hand into it . His fingers felt the wool , the needles , the sweater . " Is it yours ? " asked the old man . " No , it 's Hagar 's , " said Tuvia . The old man went up to the ragged sacks and rummaged among them . " Maybe Yiftach left something here too , " he said . " Maybe , " said Simcha , " but it does n't look to me as if he was here at all . " The old man turned to Tuvia who was standing a little apart from Simcha , and whispered something in his ear . Afterward they both walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell Tuvia something . " The old man went back to Simcha , and gave him the dog . " Look after him , we 'll be back in a minute . " Taken aback , Simcha moved closer to the wall , holding the rope in his hand . With the flashlight shining in front of them they stepped onto a path leading between the trees . The old man took a packet of tobacco out of his pocket . The light veered off the path and skipped over the leaves . " Do you smoke ? " he asked Tuvia . " No , " said Tuvia . The old man stopped , rolled himself a cigarette , and stuck it together with his tongue . Then he lit the cigarette and said : " It 's a pity you do n't smoke . " They continued walking and he added hesitantly : " It 's not because of that bag you found that I brought you  | here by yourself . What goes on between you and Hagar does n't interest me , even though .... " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old man 's shoulder and stopped him . " Shut up about Hagar . I think your eyes are too big . " " My eyes are an old man 's eyes , but your eyes , young man , are too small . " The cigarette was stuck in the corner of his mouth . " Never mind that , " he added immediately . " I think the business with Yiftach is serious . I told him myself that Hagar had come here . I met him in the Arab village . He was playing with his new canteen . I met Hagar too . But she came back alone . " " And where was the soldier ? " " I did n't see him . " The old man stepped off the path , and Tuvia followed him into a tangle of branches and leaves which brushed against his clothes and tugged at his hair . The light ran over the ground and revealed dry leaves . " It 's happened before , " said the old man when they reached a little clearing among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's happened before ? " " That a child disappeared . It was long ago . You know there 's an army camp not far from here . It used to be a British camp . I worked there as a builder . Your father worked there too , when he was a cart-driver . He transported rocks from the quarry to the camp . No question about it , he did good business . Well , never mind that . There were a few British officers living here . The son of one of them went for a walk and got lost . "  | The old man lit the flashlight and shone it onto the opening of a water hole dug in the middle of the clearing . Weeds covered the edges of the pit . " Here , in this well , which still worked then , they found him . The child . That 's why I brought you here . " They approached the edge of the pit . The flashlight shone on a rusty ladder . " Take the flashlight . And go down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water in the well . They blocked it up with stones . But we should check it out . I 'm sure that if we go back now , Yiftach wo n't be at home . I know those scamps . Roaming all over the place . " Tuvia was silent . A sharp cold flooded his face . He moved closer to the edge of the pit and looked inside . Long iron rods stuck out of the soil . " It 's not deep , " he heard the old man 's voice . " Go on down . " He gripped the ladder and began descending rung after rung . The ladder vanished into the stones blocking up the well . He stopped . With one hand he clung to the ladder , and with the other he shone the flashlight on the walls . He felt a heavy pressure on his ears . It was hot . His face was sweating . The dust of all kinds of junk clouded his eyes : tins , cement blocks , broken crates . There was a smell of rotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the well , next to the ladder . He pulled the pole toward him and poked about in the junk with it . He pushed sacks out of the way , moved planks . The pit filled with dust . He did n't find anything . He shoved the flashlight into his belt and climbed up the ladder . He was choking on the dust and felt that his undershirt was soaked with sweat .  | A gust of cold lashed his damp face as he poked his head out of the pit . The old man held out , his hand to help him up . " Nothing , " said Tuvia . " There 's nothing down there . " He returned the flashlight to the old man , who gave him Hagar 's bag . " Good , " said the old man . " Let 's go back and drive to Simcha 's place . Please God the boy 's already home . I 'm afraid , afraid . " They walked back along the path . " Do n't say anything to Simcha yet , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The main road was empty . The streetlights were out . Their street was deserted too , but when they approached the gate of Tuvia 's house a woman ran out to them . It was Sarah . The dog barked . Tuvia parked the jeep at the side of the road , and Sarah ran straight to Simcha . The old man looked at Tuvia , who was leaning against the warm engine hood . " Well ? " she asked . " Has n't he come home yet ? " asked Tuvia . " No , " said Sarah . She came up to him and said quietly : " You should teach your wife to tell the truth . She 's a liar . " " Quiet , " said Simcha . " What quiet ? This afternoon she said that she went for a walk with him . This evening , when he did n't come back , she said she did n't . I 'm sure she 's hiding something . It does n't make sense that he has n't come home yet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to know where he is . And you too , " she turned to Tuvia , " if you want to stick up for her , then go to her . We do n't need you here . " " I think that Yiftach ate at our house more than once , " said Tuvia , " and Hagar was always very good to him . I do n't know what you want of her . " Tuvia felt the old man 's hand tighten around his arm . Silence descended on the street . Only the dog ran around the old man , sniffing the ground , and then climbed up his legs , scratching his trousers . In Tuvia 's house , in the bathroom , the light went out . The distant sound of a car engine reached them . Sarah was silent . She went into their yard and walked slowly to the front door . Simcha looked at the motionless jeep and followed his wife . " There 's nothing to do now , " the old man said to his receding back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the police . " " Thank you , " said Simcha without turning his head . " Look after her , " said the old man and pointed to Sarah . Tuvia got into the jeep . " Come on , get in , " he said to the old man . " I 'll take you home . " " No need , " said the old man . " I 'll walk . " The shadows of the old man and the dog disappeared up the street . Tuvia parked the jeep in the yard , shut the gate and went inside .  | In front of the door he paused for a moment . His undershirt was still wet with sweat . In his hand he held Hagar 's knitting bag . The veranda light was on . Mosquitoes swarmed around the naked bulb above him . A bad smell came from his work shoes standing on the marble ledge . He went into the kitchen . There were two empty coffee cups on the table . Hagar was lying in bed , awake . She looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did n't say hello . " I 've brought you something , " he said . " Did Yiftach come back ? " Tuvia threw the bag onto the bed . " You were there today , in that Arab house , were n't you ? " There was a gray thread from one of the sacks in the ruined house sticking to the knitting bag . Hagar was covered with the thin , white summer coverlet , and only her head was sticking out . " Yes . But I only saw him . It 's not true that I went for a walk with him . " " With whom ? " " Has Yiftach come back ? " " I think I asked you a question . " Hagar took the unfinished sweater out of the knitting bag . Tuvia went on standing by the door . " No , " he said , " he has n't come back . " She rolled the ball of wool over the bed and played  | with the knitting needles . The sweater lay on the pillow , next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she asked . He came up and sat down on the bed . " You should n't have lied to her , " he said . " I looked for him all day . Ask Bulkin . I was confused . I only saw him for a minute . What a day .... " " Did you go to the school ? " " No , I 'll go tomorrow . " " And what did you do today ? " " Why do n't we go to sleep , " she said . He looked at his watch . It was a quarter to one . " And I have to go to work in the morning , " he said and took off his shoes . " You 've got grass on your shirt . " She bent over him and brushed off the grass . " Sarah 's cross with me too , " he said . " She 's cross with the whole world . " " Maybe she 's right . " " But someone should be on my side too in all this argu-ment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tuvia . " She left Yiftach with you . And he has n't come home yet . " " She did n't leave him with me . He went to Acre with Bulkin this morning . " " And who 's the soldier you were with in the moshav ? " " Do you really want to know ? " Tuvia did n't answer . His pajamas were lying on the bed and he took off his shirt and put it on the chair . When he was dressed in his pajamas he went to the window and looked out . There was a light on in Simcha and Sarah 's  | house . His throat was dry , and Hagar looked at him and : asked : " Would you like me to make you something to drink ? " She got up and went to the kitchen . His hair felt dry , even though he had washed his face . fie was very tired . He sat on a chair in the kitchen , leaning against the wall , and his hand holding the glass of tea trembled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table and put his hands on his knees . " Do you think there 's any danger ? " Hagar stirred the sugar into her tea . The teaspoon hit the glass and made a tinkling sound . " I have n't got the strength to get up , " he said and with the help of his hands leaning on the table he rose to his feet and walked to the bedroom . He got into bed , and in spite of the light on in the room he closed his eyes and tried to fall asleep . There was a knock at the door again . Hagar opened the door . It was Simcha . " Sorry , " he said . " This is the third time we 've woken you up tonight . But " " Never mind , " said Hagar . " Is Tuvia asleep already ? " " No , " Tuvia called from the bedroom . " What 's up ? " Simcha came in . He was still in his work clothes , and his unshaven face was covered with stubble . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . His red eyes wandered over the room . " I think we should inform the police . Sarah 's crying all the time . " Sarah was waiting for them in the street , and Simcha gave her the seat next to Tuvia . In Kasos 's cafe the light was still on .  | " Go and ask him , " Sarah said to Simcha . " What for , " said Simcha . " Yiftach 's not there . " " Of course he 's not there , but maybe Kasos knows something . " " There 's no need to drive the whole world crazy . " Tuvia stopped the jeep . " Go on , " he said to Simcha . " Words do n't cost money . " Simcha hesitated and then got slowly out of the jeep . The light pouring out of the cafe fell onto the paving stones of the sidewalk and onto the round pillar with the notices and posters pasted onto it . Kasos had already turned the chairs up onto the tables , and he was sweeping the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the door and leaned on the broom to wait for him . They exchanged a few words , and Simcha returned to the jeep . Tuvia and Sarah did n't ask any questions . Tuvia started the jeep . There seemed to be nothing on the sides of the road as they drove . No houses , no trees , just darkness and desolation . The police station was dark too , with only two lights on next to the fence . A patrol car pulled onto the road . The eucalyptus trees were tangled and silent . They could- n't see the bars of the detention cells on the ground floor . The telephone operator was sitting next to the switchboard , his arms crossed on the long , high counter . His head was resting on his arms , and his eyes were closed . All three of them entered the waiting room , but it was Sarah who spoke . She went up to the operator , touched his arm , and roused him .  | " What do you want ? " He woke up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lying to one side . " My little boy has n't come home all day , " said Sarah . Her dress was creased . " So what do you want me to do , bring him home ? " He picked up a pencil . The telephone rang . " It 's so late . I have n't seen him all day . " " Just a minute , " said the policeman , and picked up the telephone receiver . " So what do you want ? Tonight nobody can look for him . We have to wait till tomorrow . " " But you can do something , ca n't you ? " said Tuvia . " Not tonight . It 's dark . " " And when will you come tomorrow ? " " In the morning . " " So what are you police for ? " asked Sarah . " Do n't shout please , lady . " He took a form and held the pencil poised over it . " Have you looked in all the places he usually fre-quents ? " " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Ten , " said Sarah . " Height ? " " A meter thirty-eight . " " Fat ? Thin ? " " Thin . " " What color eyes ? " " Green . "  | " Hair ? " " Brown . " " Clothes ? " " A blue knit shirt . Short khaki pants . Sandals . " " Distinguishing characteristics ? " " A canteen . " " On his body , I mean . Like a scar , or a birthmark . " " No . But he apparently had a canteen on him . " " Languages ? " " What languages ! He 's ten years old ! " The policeman wrote down the details . The old watchman walked slowly down the dirt track . The dog dragged behind him , tired . The air was clear , and the darkness gave it a chill . On the corner he stopped and rolled himself a cigarette . In the distance he saw the figure of a man . When it came nearer , he saw by the can of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The old man stood and smoked . The dog wagged his tail and ran into the avenue . Bulkin stopped next to one of the trees and pasted a yellow poster onto its trunk . When he saw the old watchman , he crossed the road and went up to him . " Is it nice to stick up posters in the middle of the night , like a thief ? " the old man scolded him . " And when the police beat up workers in the port in broad daylight , is that nice ? " retorted Bulkin . The dog came back and began sniffing the glue . " And what are you doing here now ? " asked Bulkin . " Going for a walk . Getting a breath of air . "  | " Precisely here ? " " Tell Hilmi that I 'm out of tobacco . " The old man did- n't answer the question . " Tell him to bring a few bags . " " All right . But in the meantime why do n't you roll me one too ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they walked on together . Before they parted , Bulkin asked again : " Has something happened ? " The old man shook his head . " I do n't know yet . Why waste words for nothing ? " In the morning the neighbors came out of their yards and gathered outside Sarah 's house . The police car drove up with its siren wailing . It parked in the middle of the crowd . Two policemen got out and pushed their way to the gate . " Let them through ! Let them through ! " Hagar stood at the window and through the net of people standing in the street she saw Sarah . One of the policemen held her by the arm and escorted her though the crowd . The other one , who was short and fat , cleared the way with his baton . Simcha came out too . He walked slowly to the gate , shook hands with Tabak , who shook his head and  | mumbled something , and joined Sarah as she talked to the policeman . The sun detached itself from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning disappeared , but the light above Sarah and Simcha Strauss 's front door went on shining . Sarah pointed at Hagar 's house . The policeman turned to look in the direction of her pointing finger , and Hagar moved away from the window . When she looked out through the screen again she saw the policeman leaving Sarah and Simcha and turning toward her house . The crowd followed him , and a muffled wave of whispers spread through the street . A second police car drove up and stopped outside the house . A few policemen got out , two of them holding dogs on leashes . Tuvia had hardly slept all night . In the morning he had returned the jeep to Yoel and announced that he would- n't be coming to work . He had promised Simcha to help in the search . Hagar was still in her nightgown , and the house had n't been tidied up . When she saw the policeman approaching the house , she went to the bathroom and washed her face , changed her clothes and tied her hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cleared away the newspaper from the table in the hall . The shutters were open , but the stuffiness which had accumulated in the rooms during the night had not yet dispersed . Without waiting for the policeman to knock on the door , she went out onto the veranda to meet him . " Perhaps we should go inside , " he suggested .  | They sat down at the table . Hagar wanted to offer him some refreshments , but before she could utter a word she heard the policeman say : " You 'd better tell me everything , without leaving any details out . A child 's life is at stake here . " Hagar was speechless . She squeezed her hands between her legs . The ribbons in her hair gave her face a childishly embarrassed look . The policeman 's hair was smooth and combed back . There was a black mustache , sprinkled with gray , above his thick lips . His cap rested on his knees . " You went for a walk with him yesterday . When you left him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Did he mention anywhere that he wanted to go ? " " I did n't go for a walk with him , " she said . " You walked right next to the border . They say you even passed the yellow sign . The warning sign . Perhaps he crossed the border . We have to know every detail . " " But I told you , I do n't know anything . I did n't go for a walk with him . I never managed to meet up with him . " " Mrs. Strauss says that she left the child with you . " " I do n't know what she wants of me . I love Yiftach too . You 'd better begin looking for him . Believe me , I did n't see him . That is , I did n't go for a walk with him yesterday . " " But you did see him ? " " Look . . . . What do you want of me ? " " Just answer my questions . " " My husband and Sarah 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were out searching for Yiftach . I think that 's what you were called in for too . To search for Yiftach , not to waste time on me . " " You said you saw him . Where ? " " Near the moshay . " " What were you doing there ? " " What 's it got to do with you ? " " Just answer the question . Impertinence wo n't help you . What were you doing there ? " " Going for a walk . " " Who with ? " Hagar undid one of the ribbons in her hair and wrapped it around her hand . A cool breeze blew through the open windows , but her face was hot and flushed . " Who with ? " the policeman repeated his question . She did n't answer . " Every minute is precious to us , and you 're deliberately evading my questions . " The policeman stood up and went over to the window . " I was alone . " " But you were seen with someone else . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went for a walk alone . I told you . I saw Yiftach suddenly , before I came back . He was in the orange grove beside the moshay . " " Are you sure ? "  | There were rapid footsteps on the veranda . They were silent as the door opened . " You 're still here ? " It was Tuvia . He looked at the policeman who was still standing next to the window . " It 's already eight o'clock . I thought you 'd already started doing something . " The policeman went out . Before closing the door he said : " I have n't finished yet . But that 's enough for now . " " What did he want of you ? " asked Tuvia . " Exactly the same as what you want . " She opened the door of the bedroom and threw herself onto the bed . " I 've got no strength left , " she said . " Come on , " Tuvia bent over her , " you come too . " " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see that you 've got nothing against her , that it was n't your fault . Come on . " " I 've got no strength left , " she said again . " How can I help ? I 'm going to sleep . Afterward I 'll go and do the shopping . You 'll come home for lunch . Will you come ? " Tuvia left . Hagar stayed in bed . It was suffocating in the bedroom again . The shutters were closed . She stood up . Her legs trembled . The echo of the neighbors ' cornmotion rose from the street . She opened the shutters . The window screen was dusty . The siren of the patrol car receded in the distance . The voices of the people scattered . Clear , exhausting air flowed into the room . She got back into bed . The white ribbon tickled her throat and she closed her eyes . Fully dressed she tossed and turned under the covers . The street was quiet . The milkman passed with his donkey . She had forgotten to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the path . He put the milk on the veranda balustrade and knocked on the door . She did nothing . He waited a few seconds and left . She heard the gate creak , the whip cracking on the donkey 's back . Her eyes were still closed , and the milkman 's gray beard filled them . She could n't fall asleep . But neither could she get up and bring in the milk bottles . The smell of the soldier 's shirt filled her nostrils . On the shelf of the bedside table she saw the knitting bag . At first she turned her eyes away from it , but then she jumped out of bed . Again he had n't said anything to her . She drank a cup of coffee , brought in the milk , and smoothed the creases in her clothes . She went to the school . She walked with her eyes downcast . From time to time she heard the siren of a patrol car . The street was quiet . Women came out of the shops with heavy baskets . Among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the policemen , appearing and disappearing behind the tumbledown walls of the houses , the stone walls . Next to the olive trees stood two policemen , leaning over the hood of a jeep , studying maps . The schoolyard was full of children . The teachers were organizing the children in rows , while the principal circled among them with a tin megaphone in his hands . From time to time muffled cries came from the megaphone : " Fifth grade ! Form up next to the ladder . " When she walked past the gate it seemed to her that they were all staring at her , and she stopped behind an old ficus tree  | and waited . She did n't go into the schoolyard , and in the end she went home . On the main road she saw Hilmi driving a cart harnessed to Bulkin 's new mule . It trotted down the road , and she turned toward Tabak 's grocery store . The sound of soldiers ' singing rose in her ears . An open truck full of soldiers drove past the square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She remembered how he asked her : " Will you be here tomorrow too ? " She could n't remember what she had said . She went into the grocery store , where she was the only customer . Simcha Strauss 's shop , in the main street , was shut . There was a white cardboard notice hanging on the door . " Did you want something ? " Tabak 's wife wiped her broad hands on her apron . She was fat , the skin of her face drawn into a close net of fine wrinkles . Her little eyes lashed Hagar . She stood next to the bread cupboard and set the little scales on the counter . Hagar went up to the counter . The smell of smoked fish rose in her nostrils . She did n't have her basket with her . " Did n't you join them ? " Tabak 's wife asked . When her purchases piled up on the counter Hagar asked for a bag . " That 'll cost you two grosch , " said Mrs. Tabak . She did n't help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put her change down on the counter , and retired to the back room without saying good-bye . Hagar walked slowly up the street , holding the heavy paper bag with both hands , pressed against her chest . The school children , formed up in rows , were marching  | in the direction of the Arab village . Sarah and Simcha Strauss 's yard was empty . The dry grass bowed over the ground . The laundry line was bare and limp . She straightened up the house , swept the rooms , washed the kitchen floor . She laundered Tuvia 's work clothes , and then she left the house and walked to the Arab village . Tuvia had been put in charge of a group of civilians . She joined him . Mr. Tabak greeted her politely . In the distance , near the group of policemen , Bulkin and Hilmi were driving in the old Morris . Next to the olive trees stood a police car with a radio transmitter . Trackers followed dogs who kept their noses to the ground . She did n't see Sarah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The policemen divided the territory into areas , and put groups of pupils and civilians in charge of searching them . They combed the ruined houses one by one and searched for hidden wells among the stones and bushes . They raised sheets of rusty old tin covering furnaces choked with sand . Everybody said : " He must have crossed the border . " Two UN vehicles , white with black lettering , drove down the road , entered the moshav , crossed the stretch of road marked as the frontier , and drove toward the first Arab village on the other side . In the afternoon policemen appeared on the other side of the border too . The peasants who had been bending over the plowed fields in the morning had disappeared . Far from them all , next to the railway line , between the  | eucalyptus trees surrounding the army camp , she saw the old moshav watchman walking behind his dog . The search advanced in a northerly direction . Late in the afternoon they were notified from the other side of the border that for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the searching stopped . The next morning they resumed . This went on for four days . From day to day the number of people participating in the search parties decreased . And on the last day it was only the policemen , Simcha , Tuvia , and the old watchman . Sarah was not yet wearing black stockings . She sat at home and waited . On the other side of the border too the searching had stopped . " We 'll notify you when the body 's found , " they were informed through the UN officers . " I 'm looking forward to your vacation , " said Hagar to Tuvia when the search was over . " Me too , " he said . " But if you want to rest , why do n't you go and spend some time at home . " In the afternoon Sarah would sit on the doorstep . She would look at the weeds wilting in the sun . One day she started going to Kasos 's for supper . She always went in the same black dress decorated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Dr. Volowitz to the house empty of both her sons . She did n't take the bus to the institution to visit her baby , and she did n't believe that Yiftach 's fate was sealed . She did n't say " He 'll be back " to anyone , but she did n't mourn for him either , and she would sometimes mention him in conversation .  | Simcha worked less in the shop and came home early in the afternoon . They could sometimes be seen in the yard . Working . Pulling out the weeds , pruning the trees , painting the doors , cleaning out the shed . Once in a while a policeman would come to their house , go over scraps of information and various ideas with them , express his sympathy and regrets , and go away again . In her hopes Sarah was helped by Bulkin , who told Simcha , when he came to install electricity in the stable , that Hilmi always went home on foot , in order to go on searching all the time . He searched beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fields . Many days had already passed since the day when Yiftach disappeared . The eucalyptus tree in the empty lot was swarming with children again , and the sun warmed the sand as if nothing had happened . Sarah and Simcha took their evening meal at Kasos 's cafe . Hagar went to the principal of the school and offered herself as a teacher . The principal 's tone was reserved . " Go ahead and study , " he said . " If there 's an opening I 'll take you . Although , you must understand , in the light of what happened . . . . I do n't know how the parents will react . But of course you should study . And do the examinations . Perhaps I can arrange something for you in some neighboring village . " Suddenly his face took on a cheerful expression , and he stood up and looked into the mirror next to the window , and ran his slender pink fingers over his gray hair .  | " Thank you , " she said . The headmaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her waist he said : " If yu run into any problems with your studies , come to me ' I 'm always here , and I 'll be glad to help you . " At Tabak 's too they seemed to have forgotten , and when she once again forgot her shopping basket , Mrs ' Tabak gave her a brown paper bag without saying , " It 'll cost you two grosch . " And with her little eyes fixed on the floor she helped Hagar pack her purchases into the bag . Hagar would sometimes go for a walk in the Arab village , alone . The soldiers had suddenly disappeared , and apart from the distant eucalypti touching the sky there was nothing to remember them by . One day she got a letter from him . The pages were creased and the pencil blunt . But the writing was clear , the lines straight . There were dirty fingerprints on the envelope . She stood still on the path , not far from the mailbox . The letter surprised her . There was another letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the branches of the lilac the sun beat down on her . A strange voice pulsed in her heart . She did n't take in everything she read . The smell of his sweat rose again in her nostrils  | In her hands she felt his rough black boots . She did n't remember Yiftach 's little fingers climbing up the window . She walked slowly along the path , folded the page and read . There was no return address on the back of the envelope . She went into the house , and closed the shutters . In spite of the darkness in the room , she read the letter again . It was only then that she opened the other letter . It was from Tuvia 's sister . She had given birth to another son . The letter included an invitation to the brit . She had forgotten that she had made an appointment with the school principal at eleven o'clock . She had to fill in forms . The chances of her employment had increased . No substitute had yet been found for Esther Schmerling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the school year . She gathered up her books which were scattered over the table , and put them on the sewing machine . In the bathroom she inspected herself . The lines in her cheeks had grown deeper . She closed her mouth and pressed her lips together . She felt weak . The letter was in the pocket of her dress . It was Friday . The previous day , before she fell asleep , Tuvia had asked her : " What do you want of life ? " " What makes you ask that now ? " " I have a bad feeling . " " Because of me ? " " Because of both of us , " he said . His eyes were fixed on the white tablecloth . His hand trembled . Hagar knew that Tuvia and Yoel had expanded the garage , taken on new workers . " I do n't understand , " she said .  | " Do n't you ? " " My head aches , " she said . He sat on the other side of the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was evening , after their meal . They went straight to bed . In bed nothing happened . Tuvia kissed her and she lay still . But now , although she pushed her hand into her pocket and felt the dry pages of the letter , she would have been ready to respond to his caresses of last night . She saw the empty schoolyard . The janitor cleaning the corridors where no child 's footsteps had trodden for many days , pushing the straw bristles over the gray tiles and the wet rag over the windowpanes dusty with the summer sand . In the kitchen , on the marble counter , in a bowl of water , were peeled potatoes . On the sewing machine were her books . She changed her dress , drank a glass of cold water , and went to the school . It was half past twelve , and she hoped that the principal was still there . But at the gate she met the janitor , who was tall and stooped , his back humped . " The principal 's already left , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago ? " " He waited for you until about a quarter of an hour ago . " The janitor was holding a short-handled rake and raking up dry pine needles into a rubber basket . " Why did n't you come on time ? " He went on working as he spoke . " Is n't he coming back in the afternoon ? " asked Hagar . " No , " said the janitor . " He wo n't be coming back until school starts . " Instead of going back to the main road Hagar turned  | into the plowed field between the schoolyard and the cemetery . The dry mounds did n't glitter in the sun they were cracked , wilted . The gravedigger passed between the tombstones , watering the flowers , strengthening the supports of the creepers , collecting the dry leaves and scraps of paper strewn over the ground . Hagar walked slowly along the fence , and when she stepped onto the sunlit main road she was seized by a feeling of loneliness . The road was empty , and she felt as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With short steps , her head lowered , she came on toward the houses of the Arab village . When she reached the shade of the cypress avenue she stopped . Between the end of the cypresses and the old railway station the ground was yellow with the sun again , and there she saw him . He stood up and walked toward her . " I thought you would n't come , " he said . Hagar panted for breath . She smiled . " Come , let 's go to the cypress trees , " she said . The ground was padded with leaves and grass . They leaned against two rough trunks . " I got your letter , " she said without looking at him . " I did n't want to come . But I wanted to tell you some-thing . " " What ? " " That I ca n't come any more . " The soldier twisted around and sat down facing her . He raised himself to his knees with one hand leaning against the tree trunk . The shadow falling on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his body . " Why ? " he asked . " I 'm not what you think . " " It 's not that , " she said . " I have obligations . " " Are you married ? " " Did n't you know ? " " At first I thought you were . But after you said that the kid you were with was n't yours , I understood that you were n't . " He fixed his eyes on her and immediately looked away . Again he sat with his back leaning against the trunk of the tree . He took a pack of cigarettes out of his shirt pocket . " Do you smoke ? " " No , " she said , " but I 'll have one . " The smoke spiraled in front of their faces in thick , dense clouds . There was no wind and it took a long time to disperse . The soldier sat next to her , hunched up , his hands on his knees . Hagar coughed . " I ca n't smoke it . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep what 's left ? " " No , " he said , " throw it away . " She threw the cigarette away . A narrow ribbon of thin smoke rose from it . The soldier watched the smoke rising from the unfinished cigarette . Hagar put her hand on his shoulder . " Do n't be angry with me , " she said . A car drove past on the road , and after the noise faded they heard the sound of a whip cracking on an animal 's back . Iron cart wheels clattered over the asphalt . " How old are you ? " he asked . She was silent .  | " When I saw you with the kid , " he said , " you seemed older to me . Now , without him , you look young . " Her hand between his stiffened . The smoke rising from the cigarette between his lips got into her eyes . She freed her hand and rose to her feet . " Did something happen ? " " What do you mean ? " " Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's got nothing to do with you . " Her eyes were damp , and when he took her hand again , she put her head on his shoulder and hugged him . They walked along the avenue , in the shade of the trees falling on the field . " That little boy , " she said , " he disappeared . " " What do you mean , disappeared ? " They stepped onto the road . " Go now , " she said . " Will you come tomorrow ? " " I do n't know . I do n't think so . " The soldier walked away . A car coming from the direction of the abandoned moshav emitted thick smoke from its exhaust and hid him from her . The sweat trickling down Hagar 's face washed the mascara from her eyes and left two dark stripes on her cheeks . The sun hit the dry grass , and at the edge of the orange grove , on the road leading to Noah Bulkin 's house , she saw Hilmi . He was standing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cracking his whip on the beast 's glossy brown back . The mule broke , into a gallop and the whip traced swift circles over its head .  | In spite of the long line of customers , Tabak left the shop on Friday afternoon and crossed the road to Kasos 's cafe . " Do n't leave me alone with this line ! " his wife cried after him , but he had already disappeared . Next to the sidewalk opposite the cafe he could already see Mizrachi 's kerosene cart . Itzkowitz , the bill-poster with his thick canvas knapsack , his pail of glue , and his big brush had already gone inside . On Friday afternoon everyone was there . Even Hilmi came sometimes , but this time Tabak did n't see him . Kasos put the box of dominoes out on the table , but nobody played . They discussed the soccer match that was going to be played on Saturday . They took the teams apart and put them together again , read the sports paper , and compared the standings of the teams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took the dominoes out of the box , scattered them over the table , and began playing against himself . Tabak was a religious man . But this did n't stop him from going to the soccer matches on Saturday . He bought the tickets from Itzkowitz , the bill-poster , on Friday afternoons . Now too he took out his wallet , and Itzkowitz gave him a ticket . As he put the ticket in his pocket Sarah came into the cafe . Tabak collected the dominoes lying scattered over the table and built two towers equal in height with them . He took his hat which was hanging on the back of the chair , and put it on his head . An old violin tune creaked on the gramophone . Tabak removed his hat , put it on his  | knees , and the dominoes fell down onto the table . Kasos brought Sarah a cup of black coffee . Sarah was wearing the same dress she always wore . The white flowers on the black dress seemed to have yellowed , wilted with dust . Her hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild , and it fell in heavy waves round the nape of her neck . Tabak stood up , his double chin trembled , and even the wrinkles on his face seemed to collide with each other . The sports newspaper in Itzkowitz 's hand fell to the floor , and when he bent to pick it up Tabak trod on it , and it tore . Tabak went up to Sarah , held out his hand to her , and said : " How are you , Sarah ? " Sarah was startled , and the coffee cup in her hand shook . Black drops trickled down its sides . All eyes were turned to the street . The trunk of the pine tree opposite the counter was dry . But Sarah thought she could see a few shoots , small and green , sprouting from it . On the sidewalk outside , slowly , with her head bowed , Hagar walked past . The record stopped playing , but went on turning round , creaking faintly . Tabak averted his face from the window . He saw Hagar turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Sarah . " Why do n't you turn off that gramophone ? " he said to Kasos . " Ca n't you hear that it 's getting on everybody 's nerves with its scraping ? " " Right away , " said Kasos . He went up to the gramophone and turned the record over . The sobbing of the violin filled the cafe again .  | Hagar disappeared into Tabak 's grocery store , and the din in the cafe was renewed . Kasos looked at Sarah 's glass coffee cup . The sides were streaked with brown stripes . And when their eyes met , he saw a glint in her eyes that he had never seen there before . 22 When she heard Tuvia 's jeep entering the yard , Hagar went back into the kitchen . On Friday afternoon the sun had a special color . The streets gradually emptied of people , and the sand became lighter and cleaner . It seemed to her that even the dry grass stood a little straighter , imbued with a spark of life . That 's how it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's heavy steps , and when she looked outside , she saw that the shutters in Sarah 's house were closed , there was no washing on the line , and the grass underneath the windows was dry and wilted . It was not until the evening , when they were eating , that she said to him : " I have to tell you something . " " Tell me , " he said . " Not now , " she suddenly refused , " later . " Tuvia said nothing and she did n't say any more . After a few minutes he asked : " When later ? "  | " We got a letter from your sister , " she said . " Has she had the baby ? " " Yes . " " What ? " " A boy " Tuvia stood up , went to the window , came back , and said : " Why do n't we go and see them tomorrow ? " " Tomorrow already ? " " Why not ? Did you buy them something this after-noon ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should wait for the brit . " " Have you got something against her ? " " No . " " So why should n't we go tomorrow ? " " I do n't know . " After the meal they went out for a walk . They walked along the deserted main road in the direction of the police station . They passed the garage , and Tuvia told her that everything was going well . They had sold another used truck . Soon they would start painting car windows with a special color against the sun . " Altogether , we have plenty of plans , " he said , " but it 's not always clear to me who all this work is for . " " What do you mean who it 's for ? " " What will I do with it all ? " " I do n't understand you , " she said , " what do people work for ? " " My father , for example , had something to work for . " " What ? " " Me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solitary car illuminated them in its headlights , and when the noise of its engine had died away , they heard the sound of their own footsteps on the asphalt . They left the main road and walked along the dirt track winding between the orange grove and the new housing projects . A wind blew , and white summer clouds covered the sky . A little girl 's head popped out of one of the lighted windows opposite them . " You may still get what you want , " she said . A sharp , brief laugh cut into her words . She stopped and pushed the hair out of her eyes . The lights in the house opposite them went out , and the head of the little girl disappeared . " Is that what you wanted to tell me ? " " Not exactly . But it 's connected . " Tuvia grabbed her arm and pulled her to him . " Look at me , " he said . They were back on the main road again . Children riding bicycles passed them and stopped next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and only the clouds went on blanketing the sky and covering the stars . A stifling heat began coming down . Hagar was sweating . " I do n't feel well , " she said . " What 's the matter ? " " I do n't know . I feel weak in my legs , my whole body . " " So you wo n't come with me tomorrow ? " " That 's it then ? You 've decided ? " " Come home and rest now , and tomorrow we 'll drive up to Jerusalem . A change of air will do us good . " " Go on your own , " she said . " Why ? "  | " Go on your own . I do n't feel well . Besides , I want to stay at home on my own for a bit . " " And every day , you 're not on your own ? " " Tomorrow it will be something different . " " Something different . . . " he repeated . " When you come back , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the square were on , casting bright spots on the street . The shops were closed and the sidewalk under the avenue of ficus trees was deserted . Only in Kasos 's cafe was the light on , and his stooped silhouette was visible through the dusty window . The hoarse strains of a violin came from the gramophone , accompanied by someone singing in a low voice . It was Bulkin , who was sitting next to a glass of beer and waiting for his supper . Between the trees they saw Sarah and Simcha Strauss . Simcha was wearing a white shirt , but Sarah had not changed her dress . Simcha had his arm around her , but her arms were hanging limply by her sides . They were going to Kasos 's , to eat . Hagar and Tuvia passed them in silence . " Why do n't you tell me now ? " asked Tuvia before they went to sleep . " Turn off the light , " she said .  | Hagar sweated all night . At midnight , Tuvia made her tea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was damp and muggy . They fell asleep again . Tuvia woke up early . Hagar 's forehead was dry and cool . Beside the lines on her cheeks were streaks of dried sweat . Her body was covered with the sheet and only her face peeped out . Outside there was a Sabbath morning silence . Tuvia sat on the edge of the bed , with his bare feet touching the floor . He looked at her . " I feel fine , " she said . " Go , and come back quickly . " " Are you sure you feel all right ? " " I 'm not sweating any more . " " We 'll go together , for the brit , " he said . Her head did n't move . Her eyes were fixed on the white ceiling . Little by little , between the slats of the shutters , daylight crept into the room and revealed her features , the contours of her body covered by the sheet , which was stained with yellow spots of sweat . " Go , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at him . He pushed his feet into his slippers , moved up to her , and put his hand on her forehead . " Another time , " he said . " I 'll stay with you today . " She kissed his hand . " There 's no need , " she whispered . " Truly , there 's no need . " Her breathing was heavy . " There 's only one little thing , " she said . " What ? "  | " Buy me something from Kasos 's . " Beads of sweat broke out on her forehead again . Her eyes were cold . There was panic in his voice : " I wo n't leave you alone today . Look at yourself . You 're not well . " She smiled . " I 'm better now , truly . All I need is a little rest . That 's all . " " What did you want me to buy you ? " " Will you ? " " Yes . " " Cigarettes . A pack of cigarettes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lamp , he saw the empty teacup . He went over to the window and opened the shutter . A bright light broke in through the window screen . " I 'm cold , " said Hagar and curled up between the sheets . " Since when do you smoke ? " he asked . " Perhaps I 'll want to smoke when you 're not here , " she said . " Why on earth should you ? " She smiled at him . " You said you 'd buy them for me . " " I did n't think you were going to ask for cigarettes . Why on earth should you begin smoking now ? " " I heard that cigarettes help you think . " " Are you kidding ? " She drew her hand out from under the sheet and wiped the sweat off her forehead . Her face was yellow . " You 're ill , I think , " he put his hand on her forehead again . " I 'll go and buy you something , but not cigarettes . " He went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard the hinges  | of the gate creak and the sound of the jeep backing into the street . Light pouring into the room woke her up , and she got out of bed and went to the kitchen in her nightgown . She made a salad , an omelet , cut a few slices of bread and spread them with butter . As she was boiling water for coffee she heard the jeep parking in the street . She washed her face and combed her hair . Her face was fresh , but the expression in her eyes was the same . The gleam was gone , they were dull and blank . " You got up ? " said Tuvia as he entered the kitchen . Hagar stirred the coffee and said to him : " I told you that I feel fine . " But he noticed her hands shaking as she set the cups on the table . She sat down opposite him . " I brought you pills , " he said . " Take them if you do n't feel well . And go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee ? " she asked . " So that you can think better , " he said , " I brought you the cigarettes too . " He put the pack down next to her coffee cup . " Thanks , " she said . She did n't take a single cigarette in his presence . Not till after he left did she get back into bed and snuggle into the sheets . The shutters were open , and she felt lonely and exposed . She was cold . Her legs felt weak . She could n't get out of bed , but the open shutters bothered her . Her nightgown was soaked with sweat again . The light bursting in revealed her naked . She got out of bed and closed the shutters . Now the room was dark . There was a cup of cold tea on the bedside table , next to the pills and the pack of cigarettes . She took a sip of tea . Then she lit a cigarette . The smoke choked her , and when Er ,  | she wanted to put the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the room . Again she had to get out of bed . There was only one ashtray in the house , in the living room . The smoke was choking her . She got the ashtray and on the way she collected the knitting bag too . She coughed and broke into a sweat again . The weakness spread through her body . She put the cigarette into the ashtray and took out her knitting . Beneath the ball of wool were two pages . A squared page , with the knitting instructions on it . And a coarse , unlined page , with pencil writing on it . The soldier 's letter . She wanted to read the instructions , but she could n't see properly . She switched on the lamp . A pale light flooded the sheet . The smoke rising from the cigarette to the yellow lamp collided with the glass and dispersed . She took another puff . The smell of the cigarette brought back the smell of the soldier 's sweat and his oil-stained shirt . She knitted . The ticking of the alarm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She took another sip of tea , put the needles down , and closed her eyes . The lamp , which she had forgotten to switch off , woke her up . She opened her eyes in a panic and heard the ticking of the clock . The cigarette was n't smoking any more . It had consumed itself , and in the ashtray she saw only a long finger of ash , which still kept the shape of the cigarette . She had stopped sweating . The weakness in her legs too had disappeared . The warmth in which the sheet had wrapped her was now an irritating itchiness . She straightened out the sheet , opened the shutters a little and returned to her knitting . Then she put her hand into the knitting bag . She  | took out the soldier 's letter and read it again . " I waited for you all afternoon . I saw policemen in the vicinity . Did something happen ? " Yiftach 's fingers crawled up the wall , touched the windowsill . Did he have the canteen with him ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sewn for it ? She dropped the letter and buried her face in her hands . Something stabbed her . She winced and tears came into her eyes . What had happened that day ? She wanted to get out of bed , get dressed , and go to Sarah . The pattern of white flowers on her dress ran past her eyes . In the kitchen cupboard were sour candies , and the night when Yiftach had come to ask for a bit of salt came back to her . She dreamed . The soldier 's letter lay on her chest . Her eyes were on the ceiling again . Yellow stripes crossed it , coming from the cracks in the shutter . Tuvia had brought her the cigarettes , just as she asked . Why had she asked for cigarettes ? She closed her eyes and turned her head to the lamp . The ticking of the clock hammered in her head . Tuvia had gone to Jerusalem . She wanted to hear the sound of the jeep in the street . She looked at the clock . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers . She touched the ash of the consumed cigarette . When would he come back ? She tried to calculate the times , but the hours got mixed up in her mind . He had said he would come home early . When ? The letter was still rustling between her fingers . The clock ticked . The knitting lay on Tuvia 's pillow . There was ash sticking to her finger . She was irritated by the sheet wrapped around her but she could n't get out of it . She pulled the clock toward her and set the alarm to  | go off at half past three in the afternoon . She wanted to go on sleeping . If he comes back by then , I wo n't go to the Arab village , she said to herself . And if he does n't come back ? Before she fell asleep she drank the dregs of the tea in the cup . When the alarm went off she jumped out of bed and tore off the sheet . It seemed to her that she had only just fallen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly half past three . Tuvia was n't back . It was quiet outside , and from far away , like the sound of waves breaking , rose the roar of the crowd at the soccer match . She stretched her arms back . Again she looked at the clock . " I do n't believe it , " she said to herself . " Another half hour , I 'll give him another half hour . " She set the alarm for four o'clock and went back to bed . The distant roaring would n't let her sleep . She closed her eyes and lay awake , waiting . The jeep was alone on the road . The sky was blue and empty . A Sabbath morning . Bereft of people . At one of the junctions soldiers held out their hands to hitch a ride . He drove slowly , undecided as to whether to pick them up , and in the end he stopped . The soldiers got off at Ramla , and he continued on his way . He met the whole family at the hospital . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his stepfather .  | " Where 's Hagar ? " they asked him . " She is n't feeling well , " he said . " She never does , when she 's got to do something , " said Edna . His mother was silent . " She 's a good cook , " said his stepfather . He still had n't looked at the baby . Tuvia arrived at the hospital at eleven-thirty , and at one he was already on the way home . Edna had invited him to lunch , but he declined the invitation on the grounds that he wanted to get back to Hagar , who was n't feeling well . " But you 'll come to the brit , " said his mother . " Yes , I hope so , " said Tuvia . And later , casually , he asked : " What are you going to call him ? " " Yehiel , " said his mother , " after your father . " " After your father who did n't like Hagar , " said Edna , as if to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tuvia asked her angrily . " What has she ever done to you ? " " Me ? " said Edna . " She has n't done anything to me . The trouble is that she has n't done anything to you either . " It was lunchtime . He wandered around the Jerusalem streets . On Jaffa Street he found an open restaurant and went inside to eat . It was a hot day , and before leaving the restaurant he bought himself a bottle of beer . In the forest next to Hartuv , families were picnicking . He did n't stop for any hitchhikers . He drove slowly and he was afraid to think .  | When he reached Tel Aviv he drove to the sea . The beach was full of swimmers , and he went on driving along the cliffs that rose above the white sand , with the sea beating calmly against them . He parked the jeep on a deserted bit of beach where the sea came up to the cliffs and there was no sand to sunbathe on . He sat on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the low waves . At the little racing boats . The light breeze dried his back , which was damp with sweat . Suddenly he thought of Bulkin , and he asked himself , where does he get the strength to live alone over there , at the edge of the village ? " And you , " he asked himself , " are n't you alone now ? " Waves broke on the cliff and sprayed white foam . Around the rocks protruding from the water were patches of green slime . A young couple were picking their way between the rocks . He saw them laughing , but he did n't hear a sound . The glitter of the sun on the waves dazzled him . The couple disappeared and he stood up and returned to the jeep . There were green bushes on the dunes , and when he tried to pluck a twig it pricked him . His shoes filled with sand . There were white clouds in the sky . He looked at his watch . A quarter to four . He had missed the soccer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the gas as if he were in a hurry to meet someone . But he knew that there would be no meeting .  | A pack of cats ran across the field and escaped into the orange grove . She had a fresh frock on . There were two white ribbons tied in her hair . The soldier was in fatigues . He had n't changed for the Sabbath . " I 'm sleeping in the camp anyway , " he said . They wanted to go to the isolated house behind the moshav again , but Hagar was afraid of the old watch-man . " I thought you would n't come , " said the soldier . " Me too , " said Hagar . " I ca n't do it to him . " " So why did you come ? " She kicked a little stone , and undid one of the ribbons in her hair . " To tell you , " she said . There were scratches on the blue paint on the wall . The rooms of the house branched out without any logical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldier played with her ribbons . Then they wandered through the narrow corridors with their arms around each other , and passed from room to room . Eventually they found a small , dark room . The coarse material of his clothing touched her face . " Are you cold ? " he asked . " Why do you ask ? " " You 're cold , " he said . His hands clasped hers . " Quiet , " she said suddenly . Her laughter stopped abruptly .  | " What 's wrong ? " he whispered . " I heard something , " she said . He left her and went outside . " I 'm afraid , " she said . They could n't see each other in the dark room . Invisible mosquitoes whined . Hagar lay pressed up against the wall . And as she felt the cold floor beneath her back , heavy footsteps clattered into the house . " The old watchman ? " The soldier did n't answer . Hagar stood up , and leaned against the wall . The soldier laced up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , " no one will see us . " " Yes , they will , " said a voice . " Yes , they will . " There was a terrible look on his face . His eyes were big , his hair was cropped , his beard un-shaven . " So you 're here ? " Hilmi came into the room , into the dark . " Come , come with me . " Hilmi 's hand was hard . He pulled her after him , and the soldier burst forward , and pulled her away . " Leave her alone , " he cried out loud . Hilmi was pushed to the wall . A grunt broke out of his chest . His head was thrust forward . " Come , " said Hilmi . She emerged from the dark room and trailed after him , dazed . The soldier followed her . " Where are you going ? " called the soldier . Hilmi said no more . He stepped between the stones . His feet were steady , but Hagar walked behind him as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The soldier clutched her arm . " What 's the matter with you ? Come away from here . Look at his face . " The soldier 's eyes were panic-stricken . " What 's the matter with you ? " His voice choked . His hand trembled , and when he took it away , his fingers left marks on her arm . Hilmi did n't take trodden paths . His sandaled feet were bound in rags . He walked straight ahead . Over thorns , clods of earth , low stone walls . Hagar took no notice of the soldier and as if obeying an order , she followed Hilmi . Weakness overcame her , and filled her with an inexplicable submission . The soldier too kept quiet , and only once , as if to himself , he said , " Do you know where he 's taking us ? " He thought that Hagar had n't heard his question , and he was surprised when she stopped , a bitter smile on her face . " Yes , " she said . " You 'd better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her strange , remote gaze riveted him to her . The day was about to disappear . Only the treetops shone . Patches of light and shade dappled the dry ground . Before they entered the orange grove she turned to the soldier again . She was calm . " Go , " she said and touched his face . " Go . " Her look was soft . " He might do something to you , " said the soldier . " Do n't worry , " she said , " he ca n't do anything to me any more . " She bent down and removed a piece of grass that had gotten caught in her shoe . Hilmi bumped into a branch that barred his way . He pushed it aside , and then let it go abruptly . The branch  | hit Hagar , walking behind him , in the face , and when they came out of the grove there was a long scratch on her forehead with blood streaming from it . The trunks of the eucalyptus trees in the army camp were whitewashed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldier , who as a last resort seized hold of Hagar 's arm again . " Let 's get away from here , " he said . " Who knows what he 's planning for us . Come on . " Hilmi said nothing . He walked along the fence , and when they came to the gate of the camp , he stopped . " Are n't you going in ? " he said to the soldier , and pointed at the tents . Thorns stuck to Hagar 's dress . The scratch on her forehead had dried . They crossed the railway tracks , which were covered with dry branches , and reached an orchard . The fruit trees were bare , the leaves dead . From the orchard a path wound to an abandoned citrus grove , whose fence sagged between bent , broken wooden posts . Hilmi pointed to the path . " Now , " he said , " you go first . But only on the path . " Hagar held her head high . She walked slowly , her eyes fixed on one point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splashing sound of running water . A few rows of trees in the grove were still being cultivated . Water ran in the irrigation canals . Green creepers trailed over the lemon trees , and purple flowers laughed among the leaves and the branches which bore no fruit . Next to the running water the path came to an end . Hagar suddenly bent down , cupped some water in her  | hand , and washed her face . The water ran down her dress . She heard Hilmi call : " Cross over , cross the canal . The path goes on . " The cultivated part of the grove ended . Again she was among dry trees , with rotten fruit rolling underneath them . At a short distance from the grove , in a field of thorns , a clump of green bushes stood out like an island . A bad smell and the neighing of a mule rose from the clump of bushes . Hilmi ran past the soldier , and Hagar stopped . A stifled cry stuck in her throat . At first , she saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the silver metal sticking out of it . The canteen . A piece of black tin lay between the bushes . It covered the mouth of the well . A long sack was spread over the grass , making a little mound . A smell of rot rose in her nostrils . She bent down , and uncovered his face . His face was split . It was eaten by worms . His eyes were closed and drops of water glittered under the lashes . His lips were slightly scratched , and they looked as if they were smiling . She covered his face with the sack , stumbled and fell on her knees . " How did he get here ? " she said to herself . Boots smeared with mud flashed in front of her eyes . " You should know , " said Bulkin , whose long hair hung untidily around his neck . Her hands clutched the damp ground and filled with mud .  | " That 's enough . " Bulkin stepped up to her . " Now go . " " Where to ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , " she said , " I ca n't . " She wept . " What do you want of me ? " she mumbled . The soldier took a step toward her but Bulkin stopped him . " Enough . Go . Quickly . " He pushed the soldier away , out of the bushes . " I ca n't , I ca n't . " Hagar writhed on the ground , weeping and scratching herself . Bulkin lifted her up and stood her on her feet . " Bring the cart , " he said to Hilmi . The brown mule with the black stripe running down his spine came up to them . He drew the heavy cart behind him . The heat lasted all night . Hamsin winds swept the sand , filled the rooms . Nobody slept . Tuvia came home in the afternoon . The house was in shambles . Old letters were strewn on the floor . Knitting needles were stuck in the pillow . He was hungry . Hagar was n't home . The clock had stopped at four , when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laundry basket . He picked up the papers and books . Among the letters he 244  | discovered the letter from his sister . He found a page covered with writing in a blunt pencil , in an unfamiliar hand . He folded it up without reading it and put it into one of the envelopes . Hagar 's nightgown was in the bathroom , on the floor . Her makeup jars lay open on the marble shelf under the mirror . The hamsin began early in the evening . He took a bottle of cold water out of the refrigerator , went into the living room , and sat down in the dark . He was tired . The tie pressed on his throat . He undid the knot , and opened his collar and the top buttons of his shirt , but he felt no relief . Only the silhouettes of the table , the bookcase , the chairs and the sofa were visible in the hot darkness of the closed room . Suitcases flew before his eyes . It was night when she returned . She switched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sought him with her eyes . He looked at her from the dark living room . Her dress and sandal straps were smeared with mud . " What happened to you ? " He leaped up from his seat . " Wait , " she said quietly , " I 'll be back in a minute . " " No , " he said , " we have to put an end to this once and for all . What happened ? " He looked at the red scratch on her forehead , and the dried tears with the steaks of mascara they had left on her cheeks . There were thorns sticking to her dress and the white ribbons hung limply in her hair . She went into the bathroom and shut the door . He followed her , tried to open the locked door , and went back to the living room . The bottle of water was empty . He took off his tie , hung it on the back of a straight chair , and sat down in  | an armchair . His legs were stretched out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The smoke of ships in the rain masked his eyes . But outside it was hot and he heard the hamsin knocking at the shutters . Knocking , knocking , like his heart . The splashing of water in the shower stopped and the door opened . With slow , weak steps Hagar came into the living room and turned on the light . She stood in the doorway , next to the bookcase , under their wedding photograph . She was wearing a black dress and sandals . Her wet hair was pulled back , her eyes were naked . Tuvia rose from his place and Hagar approached him . She stood facing him , and when she met his eyes she said : " There 's one more thing I want you to do for me . " " What ? " " Come with me now . " " Where to ? " " To Sarah . " " What for ? " " You 'll know everything soon . But I have n't got the strength to go alone . " " Are you all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street was empty . They crossed it and stood outside the wooden gate . Sarah and Simcha were sitting in the yard , on low chairs , next to the door of the house . Outside too it was hot and suffocating . Simcha saw them coming , but Sarah said to him : " Go and ask them what they want . " Simcha did n't budge from his place . They walked slowly up to him , and Hagar said , " Hello . " Only  | Simcha replied . Sarah was silent . She sat in her black dress with the white flowers and stared at the sagging fence . Behind her the laundry line swayed in the wind . There was a floor rag hanging from it . Simcha brought two chairs . But Hagar had already seated herself on the high doorstep , opposite them . The chair he had brought for her remained empty . Silence fell again . Only the wind wailed , and struck their skin . Hagar looked at Tuvia . But he was staring at the ground . Around them was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sign . For a can to rattle , a car to pass , a cat 's howl to break the silence . She sat on the step and the pale light falling from the light at the front of the house bathed her face . They sat like that the whole night . Simcha buried his face in his two thick hands . Sarah looked at the fence . She dug her eyes into the barbed wire as if she wanted to get right inside it . The lines on her face were like scratches . Her eyes remained fixed on one spot . There was n't a drop of sweat on her forehead . Her hands lay on the arms of her chair , her head dropped to her shoulder , and only her hair waved slightly in the hot wind . The stars were covered with a thick layer of purple haze , and the dense sky seemed about to fall to earth . It was Simcha 's hoarse voice which broke the heavy heat . He pulled a pack of cigarettes out of his shirt pocket . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took one .  | Smoke blown from Hagar 's mouth , from Simcha 's chest , floated on the heavy air . Tuvia did n't say a word . The wind was hot , and so was the smoke , but Hagar 's eyes were moist . " Sarah , " she said , " believe me . " Sarah did not avert her face from the fence . Simcha finished his cigarette . When he lit himself another , he asked : " You want another one ? " Hagar took the cigarette and rolled it between her fingers . Tuvia 's white shirt was open , and there were sweat stains on the collar . Brown stains which needed laundering . But the laundry line behind her was empty , swaying silently in the wind . Mosquitoes gathered around the lamp which lit the yard . A mosquito hit her forehead , and got entangled in the lock of hair falling over the scratch . The mosquito whined and buzzed in her ear , but Hagar did n't move . In one hand she held the cigarette . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green embroidery which decorated the edges of her dress . Her unmade-up face looked haggard . She looked at Tuvia . He said nothing . His lips were clamped together . She noticed that he was unshaven . Was that how he had driven to Jerusalem ? She did n't recognize his face and she knew that he would n't say anything to her . She stood up . Tuvia went on sitting . The wind blew her hair over her forehead . " Enough , " a weak voice suddenly said . " Enough . Go away now . " It was Sarah . The wind blew her dress to one side . Next to the gate she turned around . The three of them looked at her .  | The creaking of the gate mingled with the wailing of the wind . Her feet sank into the sand . The next day , at eleven o'clock , the funeral took place . The hamsin did n't stop blowing . Sarah did n't speak to anyone . Early in the morning she ' took a shower and changed her dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straw hat over her black scarf . It was impossible to see her eyes . Her face was in shadow . Friedman the cart-driver passed through the streets with the funeral cart . It was still empty . The wheels clattered over the burnt asphalt and the reins clacked on the horse 's hide . The long shafts rattled and the people came out of their houses . The shops along the main street closed , one after the other . It was hot and a lot of flies collected around the mare 's big eyes . There were black tears in her eyes , reflecting the trees and people standing opposite her . But later on there were no people standing in front of her brown eyes . In spite of the flies swarming round their edges , she held her head up . And behind her , after the long cart , with Friedman sitting on it in his black hat and white beard , walked the funeral procession .  | Sarah walked right behind the coffin , close to Simcha , her husband , but not touching him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out on their rough skin . In the same row walked Tabak and his wife , Kasos and his sons , and the school principal . The pupils were mixed with the crowd . This time they did n't march together . Because of the long vacation , perhaps . Only the wreathbearers walked in white shirts , in pairs , a boy and a girl . Tzemach and his partner walked right behind the first row , and only occasionally merged with the grown-ups crowding up behind them . Tuvia did n't walk with Yoel and Carmela , but at the back , among the people who joined the funeral procession in the street , from the sidewalks , the porches , the storefronts . He was shaved and he wore clean , blue working clothes . The keys of the jeep dangled from his hand . Bulkin and Hilmi walked behind him . Bulkin was unshaven , and apart from the shabby cap on his head he looked just as he had the day before . In his muddy boots , his worn , brown corduroy trousers . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair . Hagar had n't come . " Will you help me take the suitcases to the bus sta-tion ? " she had asked Tuvia in the morning . She was standing on the ladder and climbing up to the storage loft over the bathroom . There was a bandaid stuck to her forehead , and white powder falling onto her hair . He  | took the dusty cases from her and put them down on the floor . Out of the corner of her eye she saw him brushing off the dust . " Yes , " he said . After that they said nothing . With the help of a sharp knife Hagar tried to scrape the calcium deposits from the kettle . Tuvia went to the funeral alone . When the procession left the main road and turned onto the dirt track leading through the citrus groves , Bulkin took a long stride and fell into step next to Tuvia . The ground gave off a lot of heat , and the smell of human sweat hung in the air . They did n't greet each other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tuvia said nothing . " You ca n't do much good here . Go to her . " Tuvia did n't say a word , and Bulkin pulled the visor of his cap over his eyes and turned away . On the right of the road the grove gave way to a plowed field whose high furrows were red , melting in the sun . The old obstacle courses and tall poles dotted about the field reminded him of the distant war , the soldiers ' training . Beyond the field stood the school building . It was empty . The pine trees in the schoolyard swayed in the wind , and on the long second-floor balcony the janitor could be seen sweeping the floor . They took the coffin into the purification chamber . The gravedigger stood between the headstones , next to the hole he had dug . The soil heaped up around the hole was fresh and reddish , and the gravedigger stuck his spade into it and leaned on the handle .  | " Bulkin , " said Hilmi in a whisper . There was panic in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forearm . Bulkin raised the visor of the cap shading his eyes . " What 's happened ? " he asked . " Sarah , " said Hilmi . " She 's disappeared . " Bulkin took off his cap , slapped his thigh with it , and looked at the people standing crowded together next to the purification chamber building . Old men from the burial society walked among the people rattling tin collection boxes they held in their shaking hands . The coins rang . Hilmi 's cropped hair was dripping with sweat , and he ran his fingers through it . Tuvia stood next to one of the pillars supporting the roof of the purification chamber . " Go to him , " said Hilmi to Bulkin . " You did n't see her eyes . " The stubble of Bulkin 's beard glistened with beads of sweat . His black eyes were alert . For a moment his cheeks twitched nervously , then his lips tightened . A mosquito hovered around the rim of his cap , trying to get inside , to the tangled hair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pillar . " It 's none of our business any more , " he said to Hilmi . Hilmi said nothing . Then he said , " I 'm going . " " Where to ? " asked Bulkin . " It 's midday , the mule has to be fed . " " Hilmi , " said Bulkin , " stay here . It 's none of our business any more . " When they took the body out of the purification cham-  | ber there was a commotion next to the coffin . Sarah was- n't there . But the heavy heat made the mourners hurry , and afterward it dispersed them . When the streets were empty Bulkin walked down the main road alone . It was lunchtime . The shops were closed . The wind had died down . Only the heavy heat remained , bowing the dry , gray eucalyptus trees . Bulkin reached the square . He passed Kasos 's cafe . Flakes of whitewash fell off the wall onto the paving stones outside . He was hungry , but he did n't go into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned onto a side path and came to Leibowitz 's barbershop . The barbershop was closed . A white curtain covered the glass door . He climbed the steps and stood on tiptoe . Leibowitz was sitting at the newspaper table and eating . His glasses were lying next to the mirror on the wall . Bulkin knocked on the door . " Open up , Leibowitz , " he called . " Who is it ? " He knocked again , and tried to open the locked door . Then he heard footsteps , and the creaking of the key in the lock . " Ah , Bulkin . This is no time to bother a person . " Leibowitz put his glasses on . " Do n't make problems now , Leibowitz . Open up . " Bulkin sat down on the chair opposite the mirror , and Leibowitz put the sandwich he was eating on the table , and wiped his hands on his apron . " You want me to cut your hair with your hat on ? " he  | asked in Yiddish . He took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto the table . First he cut his hair , then he shaved him . He lathered his face , and before he reached the upper lip he switched on the fan . Bulkin looked at himself in the mirror . " You know what , " he said quietly to Leibowitz , " leave me a mus-tache . " " Where will it get you ? " asked Leibowitz , again in Yiddish . " Leave it , " said Bulkin . " Why not . " The air in the room cooled . Through the curtains on the barbershop windows and door it was possible to see that outside nothing had changed . Bulkin was already shaved , and Leibowitz washed his face . After drying the hard skin , he went up to the little cupboard hanging on the wall . " And what aftershave , Bulkin ? Like always ? Roses ? " Bulkin stretched his legs out in front of him , leaned on his hand , and looked in the mirror . " Have n't you got anything else today ? " he asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said in Hebrew . And in Yiddish he added : " Whatever you like . " There were bits of cut hair all over Bulkin 's brown trousers . " All right , " he said . " Let 's have chrysanthemums .
