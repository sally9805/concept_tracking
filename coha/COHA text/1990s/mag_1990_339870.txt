It is only natural that a red-blooded American who has repeatedly been called a wimp should derive a certain satisfaction from the sudden accusation that he is actually a bully . Hence the strutting , **27;9972;TOOLONG ? comments coming from the White House just after the invasion of Panama . <P> But the Bush Administration soon adopted a more seemly tone  --  restrained , conciliatory , even a tad remorseful about the earlier chest pounding . Legal experts warned that official American name calling might jeopardize the prosecution 's case against Manuel Noriega . But there was another reason for George Bush 's eagerness to put away the big stick and start talking softly again . He believes in that AT &T; advertising slogan , " Reach out and touch someone "  --  not with the 82nd Airborne but with a telephone call . Starting in the early hours of Operation Just Cause , he talked to more than a dozen foreign leaders , many of them in Latin America . They were polite , in some cases even supportive , but in virtually all cases cautionary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Soviet Union finally seemed to be getting out of that business . The Kremlin did some remonstrating of its own . At their Malta meeting , Mikhail Gorbachev had complained to Bush about the U.S. 's military muscle flexing during the attempted coup in the Philippines ; now here was Uncle Sam in Panama , again seeming to relegitimize the use of force . <P> Then there was another awkward feature of the operation : maybe it was a just cause , but it was hardly a fair fight . The ratio of the U.S. 's population to Panama 's is 100 to 1 . Factor in the overwhelming superiority of the American military , and it might as well be 1,000 to 1 . Similar odds prevailed during Ronald Reagan 's conquest of Grenada in 1983 and his **25;10001;TOOLONG bombing raid against Muammar Gaddafi in 1986 . A none-too-edifying pattern is emerging in the late 20th century . Since conflicts between nuclear-armed big boys may lead to Armageddon , being a superpower has come to mean roaring at mice  --  picking on someone emphatically not your own size . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing tall against pygmies . But they can not expect enthusiastic cheers from the rest of the world . <P> Bush was receptive to the overseas reaction . In general , he is a good listener , unusually so for a politician . He is also very much a foreign policy President . He savors and nurtures his personal relationships with other leaders . A number of those he consulted said that whatever the provocation and even justification for attacking Panama , there would be a price to pay abroad . That message meant at least as much to Bush as the gloating of his political advisers over the payoff at home . To his credit , he seemed genuinely embarrassed when the bumptious Republican National Committee chairman Lee Atwater rushed to treat Noriega like Willie Horton , the murderer and rapist whose mug shot figured so prominently in the 1988 campaign  --  a bad guy that good Americans love to hate .
