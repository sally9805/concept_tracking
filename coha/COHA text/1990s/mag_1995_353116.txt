THEY WERE ABOUT TO PICK A JURY to hear a civil suit in rural Alabama the other day , and the home-side lawyer for the plaintiffs assured the jury pool of farmers and sewing-machine operators , stock clerks and bookkeepers that he did n't want " to pry into your life , " but said he wanted to know , " Is there anyone here who does n't believe in filing a lawsuit for any reason ? Is there anybody here who simply does n't believe a jury should award punitive damages in any amount ? " It was pretty quiet , and no wonder . <P> This was in Clayton , one of two seats ( the other is Eufaula ) of Barbour County , an ordinary little county that has become nationally recognized as tort hell . The lawyer was Jere Beasley , who was once the Clayton High School quarterback and twice the lieutenant governor . Now 59 but still thick as an antebellum column in the neck , Beasley has a reputation for taking the side of ordinary folk against big corporations and bringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millions . Now he smiled at the prospective jurors , 100 people or so ; everybody knew of him . <P> Next it was the other attorney 's turn , Bob Bradford from Montgomery , representing an insurance and finance company . Said Bradford : " I come from a small community . I am sure there are folks that , if I went to high school with and they were on my jury , they might lean a little my way . Would any one of you tend to lean a little bit toward Mr. Beasley ? " The judge was William Robertson , 51 , a former law partner of Beasley 's , and a protege in Little League baseball ( " He was a hero we looked up to , " the judge says of Beasley ) . In less than 24 hours the defendants-accused of violating state laws by requiring borrowers to take out life insurance policies to cover the amounts of their loans-had folded and settled 45 cases out of court for $4.1 million . By Beasley standards they got off light : if it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size of the wheelbarrow they would have needed to haul away the verdict money . <P> Last week , as the House of Representatives voted for legal-reform measures as part of a Republican pledge to stanch the tide of frivolous lawsuits and to rein in society 's litigious ways , the anecdotal evidence of the reformers ' nightmares was nowhere stronger than in Barbour County . Last year juries in Alabama awarded $200 million in punitive damages , some of it in cases where actual loss was minuscule compared with the damages . " Alabama is off the charts , " said George Priest , a Yale University professor of law and economics . " Lawsuits used to be about restitution . Now Jere Beasley goes into court and not only gets the money back ; he gets $25 million in punitive damages . There is no other county in the U.S. like Barbour County . "
