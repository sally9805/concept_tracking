Section : NEW LIVES Lives have changed since the 1987 crash . In today 's slumping economy , there are lessons here for us all . Q. What do you call a former yuppie arbitrageur ? <p> A. " Waiter ! " <p> Ah , yes , remember the Wall Street layoff jokes , the ones about former hotshot investment bankers and defrocked arbitrageurs joining the downwardly mobile ? The point seemed to be twofold : first , to gloat at the fall of those who had come to epitomize ' 80s greed and excess and , second , to speculate about how these awful yuppies , without their six-figure incomes , would fare now that they were in the real world . <p> On Oct. 1 , perhaps the most conspicuous yuppie of them all , Michael Milken , is due to appear in Manhattan Federal District Court for sentencing on securities violations and mail fraud . But while he may be a symbol , the more than 40,000 Wall Streeters who have lost their jobs since October 1987 are the reality . They have suffered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give us cause for gloating satisfaction . Many of those who succeeded on Wall Street in the ' 80s were n't as different from the rest of us as we might like to believe . Some were immoral or amoral , others may have been more driven by the love of a dollar than we  --  and more arrogant in spending it  --  but perhaps the worst thing the vast majority did was out-earn us . And after the October 1987 crash , when Wall Street downsized , the yuppies  --  like farmers , steelworkers and auto workers before them  --  became victims of macroeconomic change . <p> Recently , MONEY talked with dozens of them , and they have proved to be remarkably resilient . Many have tried to figure out what really matters and what does n't . Some speak as if the crash almost saved their lives . Especially today , with an economic slump gripping the country , their stories carry important lessons about the real value of a nest egg , about the fallacy of making financial assumptions that are far from guaranteed , about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that very few of us are as tied to  --  or trapped by  --  well-paying jobs as we might think . A dreamer who had to come home <p> In 1987 , Mike Ward , 38 , made $335,000 as an institutional bond salesman in First Boston 's San Francisco office . Last year , he earned $26,000 running a 10-minute oil-change operation in Bozeman , Mont . <p> And he 's happy about it . <p> Mike Ward 's story speaks to anyone with a long-held dream . His hobby is calf roping . He grew up outside of Bozeman on an 18,000-acre cattle ranch . And he 's now returned home with a comfortable nest egg , just as he always hoped to do . <p> " For me , Wall Street was always a means to an end , " he says . Many people , of course , have said that , only to lose themselves  --  and their resolve  --  to the glitz and the high living . Ward did n't . He loved his sales jobs at Salomon Bros. and First Boston from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next move was near . " I wanted to spend more time with my family Ward and his wife , Linda , have two sons , now 6 and 4 , and when the job became a grind I chose to leave . " His January 1988 departure was voluntary but had he waited a week longer , he says , " I probably would have gotten laid off anyway . " <p> The Wards sold their house in Petaluma , Calif. and moved back to Montana . With proceeds from that sale , they paid $210,000 in cash for a house and 30 acres of land in Bozeman . Hoping to find new professional energy in his new location , Ward had arranged for a job as a retail broker there . <p> The move went well , with one exception : Ward liked his new job even less than his old one . " I did n't have a whole lot of patience with the retail mentality  --  with either the customers or my bosses , " he says . " It could take you two months to sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Ward began to wonder about starting his own business . What , he asked himself , did Bozeman need that it did n't already have ? Though he says he knew nothing about cars , he perceived a niche and opened his Ready Lube . For its start-up on Nov. 17 , 1988 , he invested $100,000 of his own and borrowed $200,000 from the Small Business Administration . <p> The business may be even less glamorous than it seems ; he does many oil changes himself . But Ready Lube is thriving and Ward thinks that in two years he 'll be able to work only 40 or 50 hours a week instead of the 70 that he is now putting in . <p> Being covered with grime much of the day is not the only change in Ward 's style of life . Where once he was able to indulge himself , now the new fence , the new car and new calf-roping horse he wants must wait . So too must various essential home improvements , and the adjustment has been mildly unpleasant . " You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if I did n't have the money , I could buy something because the next bonus check would always cover it . Now my wife gets upset because I 'm still not very good at budgeting . " <p> Ward also misses the business trips to New York : rooms at the $275-a-day Helmsley Palace and $150-a-person meals . " But the perks on Wall Street , " he says , " were never , free . " An analyst who took a big gamble <p> " I came from Wall Street where I was catered to ; now I 'm on my hands and knees getting gum off the rug , " says Christine LaBastille , 39 , part owner and manager of the Executive Mother , a tony midtown Manhattan boutique selling maternity clothes , toys and infants ' outfits . <p> Not only is LaBastille struggling to balance the satisfaction of a challenge with the sacrifice it requires , but she must confront the arithmetic of a very frightening risk every day . Although the elegant store where some dresses cost $300 appears to be extremely successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a former consumer stock analyst with E.F . Hutton and Shearson , says there are many problems . This year the store 's cash flow will be only marginally positive . Theoretically , LaBastille draws an $80,000 salary , but she has n't given herself a paycheck since May . <p> She concedes that " I really hate retail . " But she adds , " I 've always wanted to run my own business , and on Wall Street I followed a lot of retail companies like the Bombay Co. and Pier 1 Imports . I 'd walk through The Limited with Leslie Wexner and discuss fashion and retailing with the chairman of Liz Claiborne . Once I got the idea for my store , I used my analyst 's training by asking questions of everybody . " <p> Originally , LaBastille thought she and her husband Peter . a mutual fund company executive , might stay on Wall Street and hire a manager for the store . But then came the crash , and in the summer of ' 88 she was fired by Shearson . LaBastille earned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earned for most of the ' 80s . There was enough money for the three-bedroom summer home she and Peter own on the New Jersey Shore and rent for the two-bedroom apartment on Manhattan 's East Side where they live with their six-year-old son . There were limited savings , though , and to raise the $700,000 needed to open her store in November 1988 , LaBastille and her husband tapped all their savings ( including her $60,000 IRA ) , borrowed from relatives and received a loan through the Small Business Administration . Before the crash , 20 Wall Streeters had promised they would invest . Afterward. only one came through with the money . <p> LaBastille works 60 hours a week  --  more than she did on Wall Street  --  and this job is much tougher . She has a sense of immediate gratification that she never had before ( " You put in a hard day 's work and sales go up . " ) , but the life style contrast is " terrible , " she says . " There are no perks in this business . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tuna fish sandwich . " LaBastille used to take three vacations a year with her husband . Now she can hardly ever get away . No longer do she and Peter have regular Friday night dinner dates at top Manhattan restaurants . " I 'm too tired and ca n't afford it , " she says . <p> She has a dream : to expand the business , sell out and retire . " I really hope I 'm not still doing this in 10 years , " she says . And she has a fear : " All the money I have is riding on the store . If this fails , I have nothing . " A search for work to take pride in <p> " Do n't you worry about not being a professional anymore ? " a friend asked Nancy Wickstrom upon learning that she was going to become a wallpaper hanger . <p> " No , I can be a professional paperhanger , " said Wickstrom , 33 , who spent 9 1/2 years in Goldman Sachs ' treasury division , managing the firm 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . <p> If anything , the Staten Island , N.Y . native and resident feels much more professional satisfaction now than she did on Wall Street . Perhaps it is the connection to her roots . Her father is a carpenter and two of her brothers are plumbers . " What I always envied about them was the personal satisfaction they felt when they finished a job , " she says . " They had a pride in their work , a sense of personal accomplishment that I never had . " <p> Until now . " When I finish papering a room , I ca n't stop going back in and looking at what I 've done . I ca n't tell you the satisfaction . I go back four or five times and say , Wow ! ' " <p> Wickstrom has never been a yuppie stereotype . Although earning $90,000 a year while on Wall Street , she drove a battered 1980 Datsun . Always a devout saver , she already has more than $100,000 in her IRA and 401 ( k ) plan . When she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $8,200 1987 Honda Accord  --  and for cash , because she hates debt . <p> Happy with her new career , she observes how " so many of my friends on Wall Street want to do something else . They keep saying they 'll get out after their next bonus . But they do n't . " She had the same experience herself : " The weird thing about the Wall Street bonus system ( her last bonus was for $47,000 ) is that you always feel you want more . " <p> When she was laid off in May 1989 , Wickstrom traveled for two months and thought about new directions . Learning of her interest in photography and design , an outplacement consultant suggested she pursue related careers . A friend told her to enroll in the Paperhanging Institute in Fairfield , N.J.  --  and offered to refund her $2,695 tuition if she was n't satisfied . But Wickstrom procrastinated , partly out of a fear of failure . What if she was a bad wallpaper hanger ? <p> " Finally I thought , we only go around once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six months as a paperhanger , Wickstrom is sure she made the right choice . She expects to earn $25,000 her first year and $35,000 the next . Like many career changers who 've made an enormous leap , she has a powerful new sense of herself . " I 'm not as fearful about anything anymore , " she says . " I 'm no longer overly cautious . I 'm interested in doing interior decorating or wallpaper design someday . But I 'm taking it one day al a time . " An end to stress <p> When they worked on Wall Street , Karen Kaufman-White , 36 , and her husband Steven White , 44 , had both the trappings and the symptoms of success . White , a $62,000-a-year floor clerk with Goldman Sachs , had painful stomach lesions and insomnia , both stress-related . Kaufman-White , a $100,000-a-year equity trading vice president at Daiwa Securities , says she was so wired at the end of a day 's trading that she needed a glass of wine just to unwind . <p> The two lived in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Catskills . Then , a year after their first child , Matthew , was born , both were laid off within seven months of each other . <p> Kaufman-White was let go in November 1988 , along with 40 others . After 10 years with Daiwa , she was given one hour to clear out of the building forever . She stayed home with her son , interviewed for six Wall Street jobs and then reached a conclusion that surprised her : she did n't want to go back . <p> " I enjoyed being with my baby , " she says . " I even learned to cook . " <p> Oddly enough , when her husband was laid off in June 1989 , Kaufman White felt relieved . She no longer had to agonize about how worried he was about her . <p> Knowing they could live for a year without finding work , they took the summer off and headed upstate , where the idea of making a new life far from the city began to crystallize . <p> In December they moved to the Catskills permanently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly enough to cover the carrying costs on both the apartment and their house . Kaufman-White began working as a real estate saleswoman in April . Her husband earned $10 an hour during tax season doing returns for H &R; Block . In August he began his own home-improvement business ; woodworking had been his passion for years . <p> Deer , foxes and wild turkeys roam around their house , which is half a mile from the nearest neighbor . " I did n't realize it , " says White , " but this is what I always wanted . " His stomach pain and insomnia are gone . Some of his hair is even growing back . <p> Kaufman-White , on the other hand , at first missed the Wall Street pace . " You had to love the action to put up with all the stress and heartache , " she says . Her love of risk led her to trade options for her own account , which eased the pain of Oct. 19 , 1987 . The week before , Kaufman-White had been prescient enough to purchase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made $7,000 . <p> She and her husband are excited about their future away from Wall Street , although their friends remain skeptical . " They ca n't imagine how we 'll have enough money to live , " she says . " They do n't understand that our living expenses are much lower . " Indeed , what Kaufman-White 's friends have worried about is precisely what so many others , in their hyperbole at least , have wished for Wall Street 's yuppies . " I think , " says Kaufman-White , " they worry we 're going to starve .
