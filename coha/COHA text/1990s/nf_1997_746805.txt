Section : The Nature of Learning <p> How do insects learn celestial navigation ? How do squirrels and birds remember where they 've hidden their stashes of seeds and nuts ? How do rats learn to avoid eating poison ? How do humans learn to create new tools and new ideas ? This special section presents the work of researchers looking into the evolutionary , genetic , and chemical nature of learning . <p> The human brain is an extraordinary organ . It has allowed us to walk on the moon , to discover the nature of matter and life , and to play chess almost as well as a computer . But this virtuosity raises a puzzle . The brain of Homo sapiens achieved its modern form and size between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago , well before the invention of agriculture , civilizations , and writing in the last 10,000 years . Our foraging ancestors had no occasion to learn astrophysics or to play chess , and natural selection would not have rewarded them with more babies if they had . How , then , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russel Wallace , the codiscoverer of natural selection , to defect to creationism , and it has long frustrated our attempts to understand the mind as part of the natural world . But the puzzle can be solved with a key idea : the process of natural selection equipped our ancestors with a mental toolbox of intuitive theories about the world , which they used to master rocks , tools , plants , animals , and one another . We use the same toolbox today to master the intellectual challenges of modern societies , including the most abstruse concepts of modern science . <p> For more than 99 percent of our evolutionary history , we lived as foragers , and our recent ancestors must have lived much as foraging tribes do today , without any of the trappings of modern civilization . Observing their seemingly simple life , many people have wondered what nonliterate foragers do with their capacity for abstract intelligence . The foragers would have better grounds for asking that question about modern couch potatoes . A foraging life is a camping trip that never ends , but one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foraging peoples use fire and shelters and manufacture many kinds of tools . Their engineering is often ingenious , involving poisons , smokeouts , glue traps , nets , baits , snares , corrals , concealed pits and clifftops , blowguns , and bows and arrows . Animal prey may thus be flushed out , cracked open , trapped , ambushed , or done in by weapons . Plants are cut down or unearthed , shelled and skinned , and detoxified by cooking , soaking , fermenting , and other tricks of the kitchen magician . <p> How do they accomplish these feats ? With the help of language , foragers pool their knowledge and coordinate their actions . Their words offer a window to the kinds of knowledge they possess . All documented human cultures ( and by extrapolation , ancestral foraging ones ) have words for space , time , motion , number , mental states , tools , flora , fauna , and weather ; they make logical distinctions between general and particular , apparent and real , possible and actual . People use these words and concepts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces , and absent animals . They also possess knowledge that is not easily expressed in words . Their mental maps may contain thousands of noteworthy sites , and their mental calendars record cycles of weather , animal migrations , and the life histories of plants . <p> So we humans evolved mental machinery that allowed us to cooperate and outsmart the local flora and fauna . Vital to that machinery is its ability to analyze and categorize experiences that reflect the world 's causal structure , which lets us make good predictions about unseen events . The world is a heterogeneous place , with many kinds of entities  --  and laws that make them tick . The mental toolbox we inherited comes equipped with distinct kinds of intuitions  --  about space , number , objects , living things , tools , and minds . We can see these intuitions at work as children first try to make sense of their world . <p> The most fundamental mental tool is an intuitive physics : an understanding of how objects fall , roll , and bounce . Its foundation is an appreciation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight and that obey laws ; it is not a kaleidoscope of shimmering pixels or a magic show in which things disappear and reappear capriciously . In 1890 , the philosopher and psychologist William James famously described the world of the infant as a " blooming , buzzing confusion , " but recent experiments have shown that babies are not as confused as James thought . Infants as young as three months are apparently interpreting the blooms and buzzes as the outward signs of persisting , law-abiding objects ; they are visibly surprised when an experimenter rigs up a display in which objects seem to vanish , pass through each other , fly apart , or move without having been pushed . As one psychologist summed up the results , " a blooming , buzzing confusion " describes the life of the parents , not of the infant . <p> But some objects do seem to defy physical laws . As the evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins noted , if you throw a dead bird into the air , it will describe a graceful parabola and fall to the ground , exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throw a live bird in the air it may not touch land this side of the county boundary . These apparent scofflaws are living things , and we interpret them not as weird , springy objects or as law-defying miracles , but as obeying different kinds of laws , the laws of an intuitive biology . Living things are sensed to house an internal essence , which supplies a source of renewable energy , or oomph , that propels animals ( usually in pursuit of a goal ) , gives them their form , and drives their growth and bodily functions . <p> This intuition guides the way people in all cultures treat the living world . Foragers are fine amateur biologists who classify local plants and animals into categories that often match the professional biologist 's genus or species . They do n't simply lump together animals that look alike ; dissimilar-looking creatures such as caterpillars and butterflies or peacocks and peahens are classified as the same animal . The intuition that organisms are driven by an internal constitution also allows foragers to predict movements and life cycles . Straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at which it can perhaps be surprised ; a flower in the spring may provide fruit or a nutritious underground tuber in the fall . The same intuition inspires foragers to prepare juices and powders from plants and animals and try them out as medicines , poisons , and food additives . <p> Children distinguish the living from the nonliving early in life . Infants expect objects to move only when launched by some external force , but they expect people to start and stop on their own . Preschoolers reason about animals by ignoring appearances and focusing on their innards . In one experiment , four-year-olds were shown pictures of an animal and asked what would happen if its outside or its insides were removed . When asked , for example , " What if you take out the stuff inside the dog , you know , the blood and bones and things like that , and got rid of it and all you have left is the outside ? Is it still a dog ? Can it still bark and eat dog food ? " , the children answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to consider something that did n't look like a dog at all : " What if you take off the stuff outside of the dog , you know , the fur , and got rid of it and all you have left are the insides ? " This time the children answered that it was still a dog and did doggy things . <p> A third way of knowing is intuitive engineering , the understanding of tools and other artifacts . Artifacts are defined not by their shape or constitution but by what they are intended to do . A store selling chairs might be stocked with anything from stools and dining room sets to beanbags , hammocks , and wooden cubes . A stump or elephant 's foot becomes a chair if someone decides to use it as one . The only thing that chairs have in common is that someone intends them to hold up a human behind . <p> Tools appear in the fossil record millions of years before modern skulls do and must have been a major selection pressure for the expansion of the brains that make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushing , strings for pulling , and supports for holding things up . Before they enter first grade , children have different intuitions about artifacts and living things . If you make a lion look like a tiger with a costume or a dye job and a shave , children say it is not a tiger but still a lion . But if , with some snipping and gluing , you make a coffee pot look like a birdfeeder , they say it just is a birdfeeder . <p> No law of intuitive physics , biology , or engineering , however , can explain the actions of human beings , who clearly do n't behave like rocks , animals , or wind-up dolls . To predict the deeds of others , we need intuitive psychology  --  the conviction that people are driven by invisible , weightless mental states , such as beliefs and desires . We mortals ca n't literally read other people 's minds , but we can make good guesses by listening carefully to what they say , watching their faces and eyes , and trying to make sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rudiments of mind reading are first exercised in the crib . Infants make eye contact and track their parents ' gaze , especially when they are uncertain why a parent is doing something . Three-year-olds show that they understand the nature of beliefs and desires and where they come from  --  for example , that a looker often wants what he is looking at , that you ca n't eat the memory of an apple , and that a person can tell what 's in a box only by looking in it . <p> A child 's precocious understanding of these domains  --  psychology , biology , physics , and engineering  --  suggests that the brain is prepared for them . Indeed , some patients with brain damage can not name living things but can name artifacts , or vice versa , implying that artifacts and living things are stored in different ways in the brain . And some kinds of mental disorders seem to impair some domains and spare others . People with autism , for example , seem to lack an intuitive psychology , whereas those with Williams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenged . <p> Our mental tools are sometimes most conspicuous when we apply them in ways they were not designed for . Slapstick humor comes from a sudden shift away from thinking of a person in the usual way , as a living locus of beliefs and desires , to seeing him as a material object ignominiously obeying the laws of physics ( such as slipping on a banana peel ) . Religious beliefs in souls , angels , and gods come from divorcing our intuitive psychology from our intuitive biology and physics so that we can think about minds that have no bodies . Animistic beliefs do the opposite  --  they marry intuitive psychology to intuitive biology , physics , or engineering and impute minds to trees , mountains , or idols . <p> And this brings us back to how our Stone Age minds grasp modern science . Formal sciences grew out of their intuitive counterparts . The conviction that living things have an essence , for example , is what impelled the first biologists to try to understand the nature of plants and animals by cutting them open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who announced he was trying to understand the nature of chairs by bringing them into a laboratory and putting bits of them under a microscope would be dismissed as mad , not given a grant . <p> But to advance from intuitive science to modern science , we often have to turn off parts of the intuitions out of which it grew . Newton 's first law states that a moving object continues in a straight line unless acted on by a force . Ask college students what happens to a whirling tetherball that is cut loose , however , and a depressingly large minority , including many who have taken physics , say it would continue in a circular path . The students explain that the object acquires a " force , " or " momentum , " that powers it along the curve until the momentum gets " used up " and the path straightens out . Although erroneous , the students ' beliefs are understandable because we evolved in a world with substantial friction , which makes moving objects slow down and stop , not in a lab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also pries our intuitive faculties loose from the objects they usually apply to and encourages us to aim them at seemingly inappropriate ones . To do mathematics , we primates  --  visual animals  --  invented graphs . These allow abstruse concepts to present themselves to our mind 's eyes as reassuringly familiar shapes : " Y = mx + b " is a straight line ; differentiable functions are smooth curves . They also allow mathematical operations to be performed by doodling in mental imagery : to add a constant , mentally shove the line upward ; to multiply , rotate it ; to integrate , color in the space beneath it . To do chemistry , we stretch our intuitive physics and treat the essence of a natural substance as a collection of tiny , bouncy , sticky objects . To do biology , we take our way of understanding artifacts and apply it to living things  --  organs as machines " engineered " by natural selection  --  and then to their essences , the molecules of life . To do psychology , we treat the mind as an organ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural selection , and as a collection of physical objects , neurons . <p> According to a saying that is well known among psychologists , if you give a boy a hammer , the whole world becomes a nail . The saying is usually aimed at overreaching theoreticians , but it seems to be appropriate to Homo sapiens in general . If you give a species an elementary grasp of psychology , biology , and mechanics , then for better and for worse , the whole world becomes a society , a zoo , and a machine . <p> Adapted from How the Mind Works ( W.
