<p> It was 1990 when people began to suspect Martha Stewart had designs on the universe . Caricatured in the New Yorker , the high priestess of homemaking was portrayed staging formal dinner on Mars , Sunday brunch on Pluto and an " Ultra-Perfect Christmas Feast for 200 in Alpha Centauri System . " <p> The cartoonist 's lampoon may only have been premature : Stewart is poised for liftoff . <p> With Martha Stewart Living magazine at a circulation of 2 million , she is seeking to wrest control from Time Warner . After five years as merely a consultant in the venture built on her name , Stewart is engaged in " discussions over the nature of their partnership , " says her spokeswoman , Susan Magrino . An announcement is expected early this year . <p> Martha watchers have always been as interested in her business acumen as in her recipe for Valentine 's Day raspberry tart . The first lady of domestic arts is a megabrand of more than national dimension . Her lifestyle empire is estimated at $ 200 million . She is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  that suggests omnipresence to come . On the horizon : the Internet . <p> Earth to Martha : Will souffles rise in cyberspace ? <p> Declared one of the year 's " 10 Most Fascinating People " last month by Bar- bara Walters , Stewart herself set the imagination rolling . At the National Press Club in November , she described an expanding " mini- moguldom " of television , books , the magazine and a profusion of products under her name . What 's more , she warned , her business of " living " has " no limits whatsoever . " <p> " We have thought of everything , " she added with enough vagueness to set off queries on whether she planned to open boutiques or issue stock . ( No to the first , " possibly " to the second : " We love the stock market . " ) <p> Stewart has declined to elaborate , leaving marketing specialists to wonder whether more and more Martha will always be merrier . Though as golden as Ralph Lauren today , they say , she could easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as classic as that of Pierre Cardin . <p> " Martha Stewart right now in everyone 's bank is very , very successful . But everyone in our business is concerned that she focus on her brand , what it stands for , " says Clay Timon , chief executive officer of Landor Associates , a San Francisco-based firm specializing in global positioning . <p> " Pierre Cardin started out as a French clothing designer , right along the lines of Yves Saint Laurent , " he explains , " but he branched out and put his name on various levels and lines of products , got into food stores and delis and basically overextended . " <p> Others have trouble envisioning Stewart as more than an American icon . " It takes a lot of effort to translate a brand across borders , " says Bob Horton , a public relations executive with Burson-Marsteller in New York . <p> Those who ca n't picture Martha smiling in a dirndl or donning a spacesuit should recall that Stewart 's lofty sense of possibility enabled her to contemplate whipping up a Tobler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Fellow adventurer Sharon Hoge survived to tell the tale in Forbes . ) Stewart celebrated Christmas no fewer than six times last year , stringing a mere 14,400 lights for the annual TV extravaganza , with Miss Piggy and Michael Jordan . <p> A practiced globe-trotter , Stewart shops Paris for a petal-shaped tart form or a five-volume work on French pastries , conducts research in Japan , Ireland or Brazil , travels to London for magazine shoots and vacations in the Galapagos Islands . This Christmas , she enjoyed a perfect view of the pyramids from her hotel room in Egypt . ( Watch for camel-shaped cookies for next year 's holiday season . ) <p> An almost militant proponent of decorative arts , Stewart has been dusting the planet with domestic perfection since her first book , " Entertaining , " was issued by Crown Publishers in 1982 . These days , audiences in Britain , France , Ger- many , Holland and Japan are being treated to nine of her volumes on homekeeping as high art  --  or , as beleaguered working women complain , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , meal , garden or wedding . <p> It did not escape notice in Washington that the press club , better known as a showcase for visiting heads of state , was sold out for the Stewart lunch . Nor was the irony lost that Stewart , unlike Hillary Rodham Clinton , has thrived and made millions baking cookies and staging perfect teas . <p> Stewart has not minimized her upbringing as a Polish-American girl in suburban New Jersey . She has graduated from the brown velvet hot pants of her stockbroker days to Armani , Ralph and Prada . Still blond at 55 , she smiles through such titles as the diva of domesticity or the dominatrix , no doubt exulting , " It 's a good thing " all the way to the bank  --  or home to her Manhattan apartment , the estate in Connecticut or houses in the Hamptons , where her daughter , Alexis , has established her own fashionable presence with a hotel , consignment shop and gym . <p> In fact , virtually every Stewart enterprise has been chronicled as a success , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who left her after 27 years . The divorce was acrimonious ; she still recoils at the name Andy . Questioned by Walters on ABC 's 20/20 program , Stewart offered advice to women going through a similar experience : " Create something that you love in your lifetime . Not only work , but pleasurable things like gardening got me through a lot of hard times . " <p> To the press club audience , she talked of women going off to work , leaving families to " housekeepers ' care or nobody 's care , I knew that we had sort of lost touch , that we had kind of unbalanced our lives very seriously . I was one of them . " <p> Not everyone is overjoyed by Stewart 's prescription for graceful living , which includes a reported 40 sets of dishes at Turkey Hill Farm , her Federal-style house in Connecticut . While she tries " to disseminate as much good information as possible , " critics bemoan her exhortations to perfection and extravagance as little more than wretched excess . After all , not everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flock of prized Araucana chickens . Nor would everyone see , as Stewart did , a palette for up-market wall paint in the pale hues of those chicken eggs . <p> No matter how the partnership tussles with Time Warner end , television viewers will be able to commune with Martha literally morning , noon and night beginning in September , when she adds a full menu of daily programming to late-night reruns and , starting Feb. 11 , a Tuesday spot on CBS 's " This Morning " to replace her " Today " show appearances on NBC . <p> As for the Internet , " we do not have our own presence on it now , " she acknowledged , " but we will . " In development is a " program called ' Ask Martha , ' which will be an outgrowth of our newspaper column , ' Ask Martha , ' and our radio program , which will start very shortly , called ' Ask Martha . ' " When will it come to a Web site near you ? Sorry , you 'll have to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How to clean wax from candleholders . How to throw a party knocking yourself out ( Answer : Order up a buffet of ham and biscuits , fresh vegetables , breads . ) How to crystalize flowers , store wedding dresses or resilver an antique mirror . Says Nanette Varian , editor of the 14-month-old column syndicated by the New York Times , 30 to 50 readers write each week , often beginning , " Thank you for helping me solve a problem . " <p> Nevertheless , trend watchers scour the stars for evidence that the Stewart luster will fade , be diluted by overexposure or at least fail to translate in the global arena . <p> Cheri De Luca , who handles foreign editions of Stewart 's books for the publisher Clarkson N. Potter , draws the limits of the moguldom around " the G-7 countries . " She adds , " It becomes a question sometimes of how much money people have to spend . " <p> In August , Fortune magazine described Stewart as the " world 's No. 1 living megabrand . " But links with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Minute Maid , whose frozen orange juice comes from concentrate , have raised questions about her image as a purveyor of high-quality domestic arts . <p> One worrisome barometer is the parody . When brand names become the butt of jokes , trouble could lie ahead . At Christmas , a paper doll parody called " Mad About Martha " showed Stewart with fork and knife tattooed on her arm . " You ca n't cut her out of your life , " the intro declares , " but you can cut her out of this book . " Two Westport , Conn. , neighbors produced a magazine , " Is Martha Stuart Living ? " and then a book , " Martha Stuart 's Better Than You at Entertaining . " ( Her tough retort : " I could have done it better . " ) <p> " Martha Stewart has widespread appeal but clearly not universal appeal , " says Rajeev Batra , associate professor of marketing at the University of Michigan School of Business . He warns of " a clear danger as she extends herself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she will violate the rule of scarcity . <p> So far , the proof may be in the tarte tatin . The French language edition of " Martha Stewart 's Pies and Tarts " ( " La Passion des Tartes " in French ) was into its fourth printing as 1996 drew to a close . A compendium of lavishly photographed traditional recipes for galettes , croustades and simple tarts , it has all the appeal of the finest patisserie vitrine . Trust the French to appreciate what Stewart has been trying to sell to her American audience : a certain quality of life . <p> " It 's going to be more difficult to expand as an international icon , " says Timon . " But who knows ? The bastion of design and good taste could just fall for her . "
