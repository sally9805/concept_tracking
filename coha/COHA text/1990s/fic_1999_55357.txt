I am a good confidante , and I 'll tell you the secret : never offer advice , merely listen . You may repeat , ratify , sympathize , query , even divulge a tidbit or two , whip up the objective correlative , but you must never give an opinion about what your friend should do next . Never , never , never . <p> The summer of my separation from my husband , I became the confidante of two different people , Sarah Siebert and Joel Metcalf . I met them at a Spanish language performance of Much Ado About Nothing , the translation of which was A Lot of Noise for No Reason ; the two of them zoomed in on me as if my skepticism were emitting sonar signals . Sarah was a reporter for the tiny local newspaper that Joel edited . In fact , they were the paper 's sole employees : owners , distributors , founders , writers , et cetera . It came out once a week ; the two of them covered every event in little Palisades , Colorado @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ park , sniffing through the crowd until I 'd been found . I was accustomed , those early days there that summer , to being observed . The town would have to learn how to befriend tourists , I thought , how to lure rather than frighten . Palisades was like someone desperate for a date , that hardly veiled hunger and awkward leer in its face . <p> I suppose the town had not changed much since I 'd first seen it , twenty years ago , with my parents . I 'd come back because I held the memory like a beloved locket , inside of which was preserved a tiny distorted image of happiness . For five years , at the height of my parents ' best time together , we had summered in Palisades . There was a bar called Fool 's Paradise , still in operation , where they 'd posed for a legendary family picture , my father squashing my mother in his arms like a duffel , as if to throw her onto the back of a truck , her shirt rucked up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chin , where my father showed his smirking teeth as if just about to take a bite out of that plump flesh . My parents look slapdash , negligent , debauched , certainly not like parents . Where was I , their little girl , while they were out drinking and yukking it up ? Roaming the woods , I thought , a habit I had n't yet forsaken . <p> " This is awful , " said the tall woman who 'd approached on my left.But she seemed pleased by the performance 's awfulness , as I was . Sometimes bad art made me laugh , other times it made me want to throw a tantrum , as if it implicated me , as if I , too , were bad art . <p> " Terrible , " I agreed enthusiastically . On my chest I wore my six-week-old daughter , whose dusk fussiness had sent me walking the dirt roads of Palisades . We were joined by another cheerfully irritated presence . My first impression of Joel Metcalf and Sarah Siebert was that they were longtime rivals , competing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it turned out they were married to each other , a good fifteen years older than I  --  the age of my husband , more or less . Their marriage , like all marriages longer lived than my own , seduced me with its caginess . They sniped , they baited , they did not flinch . Their humor was bitter . They seemed worn out and stringy like the old animals at the zoo , the mangy lion , the weary wolf . Many avoid the zoo lifers ; you might prefer the young animals , the ones who do n't yet know precisely what they 're in for and keep bounding to the fence . But I was attracted to jadedness , preferring to think of it as wisdom . Precocious , I had always looked to my elders for instruction . <p> They were overly glad about my Ph.D .  --  Palisades was a town about to explode into a fancy resort , full of real estate agents and skiers , developers and bimbos , everyone with what Sarah called well-defined " thigh meat . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to indicate general dingbattiness , widespread unworth . A Lot of Noise for No Reason was put on , he told me , as a nod to the Mexican construction workers who , during the day , laid brick and blew up tree stumps , while at night had nothing to do but drink and graffiti the alley dumpsters . But nobody I noticed at the performance was speaking Spanish except the actors themselves . <p> " We 're from New York , " Sarah informed me . <p> " L.A. , " I responded . The two snotty coasts , represented here in an alpine paradise , a dearth of intellect . That was okay by me ; I was tired of talking to people intelligently . My husband had sent me away for the summer . " I have to be alone , " he 'd pleaded . He forgot to eat , often did not sleep , could most frequently be found staring at his own thoughts . Or he cried , which made me helpless with fear . He flexed his thick hands and boxed his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was simply indifferent , living in the same house like an intolerant tenant , besieged by rather than bonded to his baby . So I took the motherhood leave my office offered and returned to the site of my finest childhood memories . My feelings were hurt ; I claimed my daughter 's hurt feelings along with my own since she was too small to suffer them . How could he bear to do without her ? I wondered as I stroked the hot moist lump of her on my chest . It was not to be understood . <p> " I walk , " I told Joel and Sarah when they asked what I did with myself all day . " I walk everywhere . " As a child , I had followed on my parents ' expeditions in search of butterflies in the Palisades mountains . My parents adopted hobbies together , and it was in this spirit that I 'd suggested to my husband that he come with us , me and his new daughter , to collect flowers or observe birds , camp even . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tactics . He sneered at the photo of my parents , the sexy way my father strong-armed my mother aloft , the nearly palpable swearword between my father 's teeth , just above those succulent breasts . It was true that having a baby had made me soft ; I was not the cynic he 'd married , not the cigarette-smoking anorexic anymore , my frenetic prettiness lost along the way to a slack healthiness my husband had encouraged by being older , by adoring me , by broadcasting his good luck . His sudden estrangement was like a slap ; I appraised my lapsed beauty in mirrors with a fastidiousness I thought I had safely put aside after marriage . My husband had grown both restless and bored , trapped by the very domesticity he 'd once claimed to have sought . I counted on him to know what we were doing , and now he was at sea , floundering , sending me on a summer holiday as if to spare me the details . I rented my cabin by the week , set up Lily 's portable crib @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . When I lay awake at night , I listened to a silence so profound I could detect my own idling blood . <p> By day I walked . Hence began my intimacies with Sarah Siebert and Joel Metcalf , avid walkers themselves . The nervous energy of New York was no match for placid Palisades ; they had navigated every trail , taken in every waterfall , stood on every precipice , crawled into every cave  --  in short , knew everything there was to know . Each had a preferred route , and I alternated days in their company , Monday , Thursday , Saturday with Joel , Tuesday , Friday , Sunday with Sarah , Wednesday alone because that was when their newspaper came out . <p> On Wednesday they also met their lovers . <p> Joel drove to Durango , eighty-five miles southwest of Palisades , to get the paper printed . His lover was a degenerate boy named Seth , a pierced , tattooed felon who had a master key to the Fort Lewis College dorms and lived like a scavenging animal pest on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They coupled on the bare mattresses of dorm rooms , snacked from candy machines , eluded security . " I have n't been so thrilled since seventh grade shoplifting , " Joel told me giddily . " There 's not one redeeming part to it . He 's the baddest bad boy I ever met . " I felt sure the rat was taking money from Joel , but Joel 's pleasure in the shabbiness prevented me from feeling sorry for him . He seemed to have erected a force field around his heart , made himself bulletproof by a tough stance , by an attitude of doomed expectation . He knew it could not end well , this tryst , but he seemed to look forward to the fallout . He was in it purely for the sex , and it was purely nasty sex . <p> " Look at this , " he instructed one day , lifting his shirt to show me a puckered red scratch the length of his rib cage . <p> " Good God ! What is he , a pirate ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wound . " There was blood all over the mattress . " <p> You wanted to spread news like this ; I wanted to use it to illustrate to my husband that I was still interesting , having found the most outrageous characters in all of Palisades to hang around with . We could have a baby , these stories would indicate , and still be in the vicinity of the cutting edge . But my husband never answered the phone . He 'd changed our outgoing message on the machine , giving my Colorado number to anyone looking to find me . <p> Joel Metcalf was endearingly neurotic , compulsive , fearful , paranoid . He was terrified of AIDS and had insisted that the boy in Durango go in for a blood test . " But I 'm such an idiot , " he wailed as we trudged through the beautiful aspens , whose trunks watched us with their black-lined blind eyes , whose shaking leaves sounded like maracas . " I made him get a test after we 'd already hooked up . " <p> " ' Hooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a euphemism ? I feel very out of touch . " <p> " Fucked , " he clarified . " But what kind of moron waits until after ? " <p> " Most morons , " I assured him . <p> " Fortunately , he was clean , but what if he 'd been HIV-positive ? I just ca n't get over how insistent passion is , how irresponsible it makes you . I mean , I 'm not a careless guy . You 've seen me  --  I double-tie my laces so I wo n't trip . I 've got a house full of safety devices because I can imagine every conceivable disaster , you ca n't believe my imagination , smoke alarm , radon detector , lead monitor , a cellular phone in the car , vitamin pills , I 've been told I 'm a hypochondriac , I get to the airport two hours before all of my flights , and yet I was willing to just forget all of that , completely go against character , for a moment of passion . " <p> " It defies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was spectacularly desperate . <p> He was shaking his head at himself , but I suspected he was a little proud of his indiscretion . Did n't it prove he was spontaneous ? Brave ? Unpredictable ? Capable of surprising himself ? Maybe the ability to surprise oneself was the most necessary of tools as time marched on . I posited this to Joel , who nodded thoughtfully . Every now and then I said something that made him glad I was his companion , his confidante . <p> " She 's so quiet , " he said of Lily , offering a rare acknowledgment of my ever-present burden . <p> " She does n't need much , " I said , kissing the fuzz of her scalp . <p> " Ha , " said my skeptical friend , he of the wretched , degrading needs . <p> Unlike her husband , Sarah was a romantic . Her lover lived in Palisades , was married himself , an alleged friend of the family , and had had a heart attack not so long ago . " April fifteenth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love . " <p> " That 's Lily 's birthday , " I commented . My husband had been waiting in line at the post office when she was born , our taxes in his hands while I had been stoically turning down painkillers , pushing Lily through aridiculously inadequate aperture into the world . Here in Palisades , Sarah had been frantically driving through a spring blizzard , her lover breathing heavily in the seat beside her , on their way to the local health clinic , him praying , her inventing a story to tell the doctor on call . <p> " It was absurd , " she said as we walked together in the July sun , " me giving him just the simplest plot line . ' You were hiking , and you suddenly had chest pain , and then , by coincidence , I came along and helped you down the mountain . ' It was absurd and shameful , at the same time , me worried about getting caught , about losing him because of exposure . It was only after the firemen drove him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might die . It 's funny how the mind gets so sidetracked . I 'm the one who told his wife , " she added a moment later . " She 's beautiful , but deaf . They have n't had sex in years . " <p> " Years ? " <p> " Well , maybe now and then they sleep together , like on their anniversary . " <p> Once upon a time , statistics like this would have appalled me ; but by then I 'd been married four years , and although we made love eighty-two times our first year together , for the last six months my husband had not touched me . I asked Sarah , " Why do they stay married ? " <p> " Why do most people ? They have kids , it 's comfortable , they make a good partnership . " <p> A partnership . Comfort . This was why Joel and Sarah stayed together , I thought . They had their newspaper to run ; they liked each other 's company . Sarah needed Joel 's biting intelligence ; Joel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without the other ? That night I sort of admired my husband 's reluctance to acquiesce to a business arrangement , to get too terribly comfortable , to worry about presentability . He 'd claimed he wanted to continue choosing our relationship . " I do n't want to just love you , " he 'd said . " I want to be in love with you . " Still , he baffled me . I loved Lily to distraction , and I mean that literally . Every week my new friends and their lovers spun into their different alliances  --  hiked into the woods , sped to the dorm  --  while I wandered the quiet dirt roads with my baby . I loved that baby . I loved the clarity of our relationship . I loved the single-mindedness of my thinking , that summer . Her father would either come back to us or not ; his decision was out of my hands . The only thing in my hands was this baby , whose desires were clear , pure , essential . Tabula rasa . Loving her was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day long . <p> When she slept , I slept ; when she woke , I attended . On the rare occasions when she slept and I sat restlessly waiting for her to wake and need me , when my exhaustion had been sated , when there were no dishes nor clothes to wash , no phone call to make , no book to read , no television to watch , well , then I looked up at the beautiful mountain out my window and let myself be the baby , cry and cry . <p> They knew nothing of each other 's lover . They shared a kind of disdainful blindness to , and lack of respect for , the other , and could believe no one else would find their spouse attractive enough to bother seducing . " I wish Joel would just admit he 's gay , " Sarah said one day after a particularly toxic fight they 'd had the night before . " He told me my reporting was lazy and my prose was hackneyed , all because he could n't get it up in bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's gay ? " <p> " Oh , that , and other stuff . " Her vagueness let me know that she did n't seriously believe he was gay . My omniscience was tantalizing , limited as it was to this couple and their sexual peccadilloes . I had only scant knowledge of their other facets  --  and , it seemed to me , less information on my own sexual urges . Those had been back-burnered by my husband 's weepy renunciation , by the fact of Lily  --  her inception , development , birth , and now our sequestered summer in the mountains . Sometimes when she nursed I felt erotic current zip briefly through my solar plexus , there and gone , tiny electric shock , not enough to hurt , just enough to scare . <p> Joel was never quite as blunt about Sarah to me-perhaps he understood that my real allegiance was with her , one heterosexual romantic female to another . <p> Joel preferred the dramatic hike , and Sarah favored the steady one . I was in it mainly for the gainful use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climbed steep Wrigley Trail that went upward , upward , upward , both of us breathing so hard we could not really talk until we topped it , forty minutes later , and then descended through the aspen grove , over the quaint wooden bridge , through the fairy tale forest , and down the more gently sloping path of the other side . Joel 's hike was a loop ; you did not have to retrace your steps . You could go at it backwards , ascend on the more stair-stepped side , then descend at a steeper rate , but that felt dicey to us both , him with his bad knees , me with my sack full of baby . His hike took exactly eighty-five minutes . <p> Sarah 's hike was into the Sheep Creek Preserve , a former mine road now closed to motorized vehicles . It rose the identical number of feet as Joel 's hike  --  twelve hundred  --  yet you completed the climb much more casually , walking as if on a vaguely inclined treadmill until you reached the top , where you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beer can . Sarah and I would sit then , soak our feet in the shockingly cold runoff , and eat a snack . Joel did not hike with food ; he did n't even carry water , just a pack of cigarettes , Zippo lighter , and chewing gum . He smoked at the summit of our loop  --  another of his guilty bad habits that Sarah was not to know about  --  then quickly came down . But Sarah liked to bring along treats , brownies or biscotti , cheese and apples , a thermos of coffee or a sport bottle of wine . She was a sensualist , often standing absolutely still beneath the rippling tree leaves , eyes closed , fingers pinching the air like castanets , smiling serenely . Our hikes were more languid than mine with Joel ; I bared my chest and nursed Lily with my feet in the stream , sunshine illuminating the fine blond down on her skull , faithful pulse of her fontanel . We identified birds , revealed our childhoods , passed back and forth food and drink and disclosure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my true friend , and Joel a curiosity , a lost strange soul I might aid . Sarah had a better sense of humor , listened more attentively , and although was engaged in a most torrid love affair , took time to inquire after my problems now and then . <p> " He 's depressed , " she diagnosed my husband . " Midlife crisis stuff . " <p> It was polite of her . Women you could count upon to reciprocate , to at least feign an interest in your life . <p> Joel , on the other hand , probably had no idea what was going on in my marriage . If he did , it was because Sarah told him . It occurred to me more than once that summer that I would have been a natural subject of conversation between them , perhaps a safe and salving one . They could have convinced themselves that I was their project , the odd young woman who , although abidingly intimate with the landscape , had not one friend in town other than them to call upon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eighty-five miles away , some dreadful night or other ? What if the baby became ill ? They were looking after me , in my version of their version of our mutual entanglement . I was their good deed . <p> One day when I was walking home from the market I noticed a commotion at the entrance of the Wrigley Trail . Two police vehicles were parked there , the four officers all standing against one of the jeeps , staring up , passing among themselves a pair of binoculars trained on something . I looked where they were looking . The sky was cloudy yet bright ; it was nearing dusk , and the air was cool . Lily slept on my chest , and a plastic sack of groceries hung from my hand . Up on the cliffs stood a man . I had to blink , so bright was the glare , so small the figure . What was he doing ? Why were the police watching him do it ? And did I have time to go retrieve my own binoculars , set down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood there waiting , like the others . Soon another car pulled up , this one occupied by a young man and woman . The man was out the door and running toward the police before the car had properly stopped . Friend of the jumper , I thought . He spoke to the cops , then ran back to his car . " Radio , " I heard him say to his companion , who had n't left her seat . Off they sped . Other traffic passed slowly , people glancing up because I was , because the police were . Up high on the cliff , the man wandered into the dark spruce trees behind the red rocks , then out , onto the cliff , then away from it . This activity might have been nervous , or it might have been meditative . It was hard to tell . At one point , he pulled off his shirt . That made my heart thump ; it seemed preparatory to action , and I wanted action . The baby was hot and damp against me , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straps of my grocery bag were cutting into my palm  --  the weight of milk and juice and water , fluids . <p> When the man removed his shirt , a second figure stepped into view , someone who 'd been in the trees , perhaps accounting for the constant motion between the spruce and cliff of the first figure . What were they doing ? Both now stood at cliff 's edge , beside each other . Were they holding hands ? They were gesturing in some way , not frantically , not randomly , either . Down on the ground the tension was extremely high ; a third police vehicle had arrived , and one of the first two had driven off , as if for some sort of rescue device , but what ? To get to those two people would require the same long hike they 'd made  --  and , since I 'd been many times on the trail just under their cliff , I knew that they 'd had to do some dramatic scrambling to arrive where they had . Their perch was not on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I supposed , one with a rope ladder . Nothing less . Nobody appeared to be dashing up the trail , and the sky , aside from the bright clouds , was free of interruption . Now the two figures retreated once more to the trees behind them , and the tension on the ground lessened . I found myself impatient , checking my watch . Come on , I thought , get on with it . Jump . You found yourself saying that sometimes , did n't you ? Jump already . You had other things to do , your eyes were watering terribly from looking into the glare of the sky , your baby was heavy , your favorite show was going to start soon on TV , and it was cocktail hour , and despite the hot load on your chest the air was growing a bit nippy out here without a jacket ... But you could n't look away , either . We observers were not together , below , separate witnesses to the mysterious drama above . I wondered what the others were thinking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the couple to jump . Or maybe they honestly did n't share my desire . I reminded myself that there were n't many people to whom you could just say exactly what you thought , anyway , never mind that what you thought was not what most people thought or admitted to thinking , besides . I could have spoken to Sarah this way , as I had during A Lot of Noise for No Reason , but it was my husband I missed suddenly . The emptiness seemed abrupt , as if he 'd been abducted just now from my side , against both our wills . " Come on , " I murmured angrily , " jump . " <p> Were they stretching up there ? Praying ? Practicing tai chi ? In the throes of a mushroom trip ? Were they aware of their audience , the cops and rubbernecks ? Was the second figure a woman ? A young boy ? Was it a suicide pact ? A marriage ceremony ? <p> I never found out . You could n't stand all evening craning your neck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . <p> On my next hike with Joel , I told him about the figures on the cliff . We were passing just beneath where they 'd been . Of course there was no sign of trouble . Nature rarely betrays our skirmishes on its surface . Joel had heard nothing of this event , which meant , I supposed , that nothing definite had come of it . No wedding , no death . Joel listened in a gratifying silence ; he was a conversational snob , generally , and you had to say something interesting or he would interrupt you with a wholly non-sequitous observation , as if he 'd quit attending to your dull insight long ago , had gone wandering down his own thought path , and now had this to say . I did n't find it rude , although others might have . Rather , his style seemed to suggest that he would do you the favor of preventing your becoming tiresome . He would rescue the chat , should you have gone astray . <p> " Another man ? " he asked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gay couple on the cliff . <p> " Possibly . I could n't see . The one had his shirt off , the other seemed smaller , either a woman or a boy . " <p> " Hmm , " he said . Then , unable to contain his news , he rushed on , " I was so late coming home last Wednesday , I had to tell Sarah I 'd dropped acid . I told her I could n't drive home right away . I had to wait for it to wear off ! " <p> " That is quite a lie , " I said , impressed with its idiosyncratic precision , its air-tightness . <p> " She could n't complain , of course . " <p> " Of course . " <p> " I thought it was brilliant . " <p> Sarah 's most recent transgression was also stunning . She 'd left Joel in their bed at three in the morning , climbed onto her bicycle , and ridden to Jonathan 's , where they 'd made love in the garage , in his pickup truck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you missing ? What if the wife came to the garage ? " <p> " I do n't know . I was n't thinking . I just needed Jonathan . And he was awake when I got there , sitting in his kitchen with the lights off , thinking of me , he said . I ca n't tell you how amazing it was to look through his kitchen window in the middle of the night and see him looking right back at me , so sad , so in love . " <p> Not long after , I met Jonathan . I wished I had n't , because he was an uninspiring love interest , much better left to the imagination . Older than Joel , he was also balding , running to fat , and wore a constant insipid smile beneath a defeated yellow mustache . He seemed a fool ; the rest I might have forgiven . It was hard to feature Sarah distraught over his mortality , dashing to him in the middle of the night , loving him as much as she claimed she did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street , the deaf woman with her hand tucked into the crook of his elbow . She was pretty and meek , deferential , and when she released her husband 's arm long enough to gently touch the sleeping infant on my chest , I was struck with guilt . Was it fair that I not only knew that her husband deceived her but that she had sex just once a year ? And smug Sarah , grinning and fulsome , could n't I wipe that smile off her face ? I had the fleeting urge to clear the air , which was also maybe to brandish my arsenal of information , say something to the wife , her husband , his lover , watch three expressions distort and crumple as if gunshot . <p> " Cute baby , " Jonathan 's wife said in the odd voice of the deaf . <p> " Pleasure , " Jonathan said , of our meeting , touching his eyebrow as if tipping a hat . <p> " Corny , is n't he ? " Sarah said excitedly as we made our way up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " <p> On Wednesday she and Jonathan hiked this same trail-except that at a crucial juncture , " up ahead , beyond that rock that looks like a sleeping cow , " they swerved off the road , waded across the stream , and journeyed into the trees on the opposite side . " We have a blanket there , " she said , " tied up in a waterproof stuff sack , hung from a branch . " <p> " Very romantic , " I said . " I 'm impressed . " <p> " Jonathan is very romantic , " she confessed , pleased that I thought so , too . " He 's the most unsarcastic man I 've ever met . It 's refreshing  --  you know Joel , you know what I mean , he 's such an absolute Grinch . But Jonathan 's innocent as a lamb . Do you know what else ? He prays . I do n't know anyone who actually prays , seriously prays to a serious God , but Jonathan does . " <p> " Church on Sunday ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Here 's the turn . " She pulled aside a small mountain ash to show me the way she and her lover went every Wednesday . We paused , as if to observe a moment of silence , then proceeded , her step slightly quicker , as if the glimpse into her love nest had inspired her . I 'm sure it had . I nuzzled Lily 's head with my lips , to keep from ... What ? Judgment ? Or jealousy ? The naive devoted wife  --  deaf , she was  --  troubled me . " He 's terribly Catholic , " Sarah said chirpily . " It will probably be our downfall , his guilt . " <p> " You always think you can circumnavigate deep character traits , do n't you ? " I said , speculatively . <p> " Oh , definitely . I pooh-pooh his religion , and next thing I know he 'll be crying over the telephone , breaking up with me out of guilt , ready to confess everything to his wife and my husband . Confession is such a Catholic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not really . She actually believed she could derail his faith , that their love was larger than his Catholicism . Love was beautiful , I thought , the way it made you dumb . <p> My employer phoned me in August to see how motherhood leave was going . He was awfully delicate about my situation , not asking about my husband , not even broaching a question that would indicate I 'd ever had a husband , let alone left him in Los Angeles . I was a legal secretary , and good at my job . The office missed me , as I knew it would , and Frank , the partner now on the line , missed me especially . At home , I was his confidante , in a formal , executive way . He used me to test his own instincts , nodding when his opinion and my own matched up , validated . Although traditional in his demeanor , Frank did n't particularly play by the rules of hierarchy at the firm . Every now and then we had lunch together . For Christmas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional money . I liked that . And I liked the art , which proved that we were friends  --  either we shared the same taste , or he knew me well enough to make intelligent guesses about mine . <p> " You 'll be back on the first of September , " he reminded me after we 'd caught up on business . <p> " That 's right . At the latest . " <p> " And you 'll bring Lily in to visit us . " <p> " I will . " I was touched that he knew her name , that he could say it so naturally . My husband called her the baby when he called her anything . <p> " Okay , then , " Frank said . This was his signature phrase , said with a sigh . Okay , then . <p> " Bye , Frank , " I said , abruptly nostalgic for his good manners , my job in his lovely office , my old life , the city of noisy angels he was standing in as he spoke to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a burst of sentiment that would make him awkward but I did n't care . I was going to cry , I thought , I was not " Okay , then , " and I needed somewhere to discharge a piece of emotion . <p> It was after a whole summer of listening to Joel and Sarah discuss their infidelities that I finally figured out my husband 's . It would have been obvious to somebody who wanted to see it . I was walking with Joel , who was despondent after having taken incredible pains to meet Seth in Santa Fe for a night , only to have Seth cancel . <p> " I 'm afraid I 'll never see him again , " he said , unable to rise wryly above the scene , incapable of attributing his fear to paranoia , inept at seeing the humor . He was scared , and all whimsy and sarcasm had left him as he realized the extent of his affection , the depths to which his worst-case scenario could reduce him . <p> Sometimes insight hits you like a hailstone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joel 's state a familiar despondency , and knew suddenly that my husband had had an affair himself , contrary to his claims . Furthermore , it was the woman , whoever she was , who had called it off . I could almost mark the day , if someone had given me a calendar , not long after I 'd become pregnant . That was when she kissed him goodbye . <p> " Are you in love with someone else ? " I 'd demanded eventually of his moroseness and tears . <p> " No , " he 'd sighed , " but I understand the desire to be in love with someone else . " He went on to say that though he displayed symptoms , he was not planning to take the next step into adultery . It was too predictable , he said , an affair . He loved me , he said . He was unhappy with himself , he said . He needed time and space , those one-size-fits-all abstractions . <p> In fact , I 'm sure he was unhappy with himself . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew he loved me , in some way , although not the way either of us would prefer . " I want to be in love with you , " his voice spoke for the thousandth time on the merciless reel-to-reel in my mind . I had been attending to that line in order to ascertain the inflection , as if it were the key . I want to be in love with you . I want to be in love with you . He 'd been in love with someone else , and that explained everything . And when even his baby 's birth had n't particularly rallied his love , that lack must have been the unbearable convergence of guilt and despair . Our summer separation now made sense to me . He was willing to miss the first few months of Lily 's life in order to save his own . <p> My husband came clear to me there , but my own situation seemed instantly a swirl of murk and confusion . Why was I a thousand miles from home , standing on top of a mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months previous telling me about the state of his sore anus and broken heart ? <p> " I feel faint , " I said , unexpectedly . " Would you take the baby ? " <p> Startled , Joel immediately began helping me unstrap the front pack . We both were surprised at my assertive neediness . <p> " I have to sit . Careful with her neck . " I lowered my head between my knees , attempting to gain back my peripheral vision , my requisite oxygen , my sense of balance . I stared at a tick as it crawled onto my boot . Lily cried in Joel 's arms , but I could n't worry . For the moment , for the first time in months and months , I was thinking only of myself . <p> I replayed my pregnancy like some beloved mysterious film , the highlights , the major scenes , the tender moments and the surprising ones , and then I revisited the small incidents , and all the minor players . Now , I was trying to guess who my husband 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It incensed me that he 'd had a lover , he who 'd had dozens before we married , he who was supposed to have sown his oats , he for whom I was in line to be the second trophy wife . His first marriage was supposed to have been the messy one , the one where he got things wrong , the test run , the mistake . I was still in my twenties , for God 's sake ; if anyone was going to commit adultery , ought n't it have been me ? But mostly I just suffered the humiliation of having been duped , betrayed , left alone with a faith in our happy life like the lone member of an abandoned religious order , its pathetic last nun . <p> I had n't felt quite this alone since my parents had died . Orphaned , again . <p> I decided I was n't going to wait for my husband to want me once more . I would go home regardless . I said goodbye to Sarah Siebert and Joel Metcalf . Never had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last names . They were sad to see me leave , their confidante , their audience , their dramas as yet unfinished . I bought a subscription to their newspaper , which I would read religiously , once home . <p> I took with me a baby who could hold up her own head and who smiled dazzlingly , faithful as a light switch , whenever she saw me . I had a good tan and calf definition . I had new knowledge , gained at the rare intersection of isolation and exposure , focus and leisure , a four-cornered limbo . It was captured there in my parents ' picture , embodied in my friends ' secret love lives , manifest in my husband 's misery , waiting in my own future fate . You wanted two conflicting things . You wanted to be sitting in a comfortable leather recliner sipping fine wine and reading a passage of exquisite prose to your wise spouse for your mutual amusement , and you wanted to be having demeaning drunken sex in a seedy dorm room with a gorgeous , soulless youth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you wanted a devoted fool to pray at your feet . You wanted something solid ; you wanted something fluid . They could not be reconciled except by a giant leap of faith . Between them lay the great paradoxical gap , the miserable marriage . <p> The image of Palisades I 'd carried with me for so long , my parents in their racy embrace , was swapped for this year 's model . Now , when I thought of that small mountain retreat , I would remember the couple I 'd spied on the cliff , my secret desire to see them take each other 's hand , and sail off . <p> <p> By Antonya Nelson <p>
