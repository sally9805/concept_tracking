Gunsmith to the President <p> The side-by-side shotgun is a great gentleman among firearms . It has resisted the whims of style for five generations and it can not be faked . The design is elegantly simple , but it is remarkably difficult to get right . Americans have stopped even trying very hard over the last two or three decades . The Parker and the L.C. Smith had been legitimate rivals to the great English guns  --  the Purdeys and the Bosses  --  but American gun makers went more and more in the direction of the mass market , turning out repeaters by the thousands and leaving shooters who wanted an American side-by-side to shop around for a good old gun or to buy new from Italy or Spain . One American gun maker found this insupportable . Ted Hatfield has an unassailable pedigree when it comes to American firearms . He is descended from the Hatfields who are best known for their ability to hold a grudge , especially against McCoys . And his great-great-grandfather was a gun maker , turning out classic Pennsylvania long rifles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped the American Revolutionary enterprise considerably at places like Saratoga and Valley Forge . <p> About ten years ago , Hatfield began making exact replicas of that gun in his St. Joseph , Mo. , shop . He did well enough ( and used computers to duplicate much of what his ancestors had done by hand ) , that five years ago he began turning out genuine , American-made side-by-sides . " I grew up shooting the classic American guns , " he says , " and I started taking them apart and putting them back together , then rebuilding them . One thing led to another , and eventually I was making side-by-sides and selling them . " Some 600 a year by 1990 , ranging in price from $2,500 to $6,900 . <p> Not long after George Bush was elected President , Hatfield and a friend were enjoying a Margarita or three and talking about a photograph of Bush on a quail hunting trip in Texas . Hatfield and his friend had studied that picture and were convinced that the President was shooting a Japanese-made shotgun . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President of the United States was n't hunting with an American-made gun . " <p> Hatfield 's friend agreed and said , " Listen , I know George Bush . Why do n't you make him a gun , and I 'll get it to him . " <p> Hatfield 's friend , a private businessman , was serious , and Hatfield went to work . Some nine months later , the side-by-side  --  upwards of $20,000 worth of work  --  was ready . These photographs are the debut of the gun . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Engraving on the Hatfield is done in a style called " floral scroll , " which was favored by traditional American gun makers . It is gaudy by English standards . Hatfield 's engraver  --  Denny Pitts  --  used an acid etch to reproduce the Presidential Seal on the gun 's floor plate , then filled it in with 24 carat gold . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : The stock on the gun  --  and on all Hatfields  --  is made of American curly maple , which was the wood of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to acquire , was replaced by walnut . The stock is sanded , dipped in potassium permanganate to bring up the grain , sanded by hand several times , stained , and then rubbed with several coats of linseed oil to give it a smooth , textured finish that looks almost alive . The checkering on the side panels is carved by hand , 20 lines to the inch . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Final finishing on the gun is called " French grey . " While this might seem suspicious for an American gun , it allows the engraving and inlay work to stand out in better relief than the traditional blue finish ( on , for example , the two sets of barrels , one in 20-gauge , the other in 28-gauge ) . For those who are uncomfortable with this name , it is permissible to say that the Hatfield has a " coin finish . ' " Whatever the finish is called , the gun is American in design and spirit . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : The eagle above the thumb lever was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sketched in by pencil , then the mortices were cut out with a chisel and hammer and undercut to hold the 24 carat gold , which was hammered in and then smoothed down with a hand file . The same process was used on the pair of quail on the gun 's receiver . <p> Photography by David Armstrong <p>
