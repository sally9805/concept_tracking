Paul McAuley describes himself as one of the new wave of British radical hard science fiction writers . " He is the author of eight novels , including the Campbell Award-winning Fairyland and the recent Books of Confluence , Child of the River and Ancients of Days ( the latter of which has just been published in England ) . His most recent book in the U.S. is his second story collection , The Invisible Country . Heis currently working on the concluding book of the Confluence trilogy , Shrine of Stars . " Back Door Man " appeared originally in a British anthology of very limited circulation . We 're delighted now to bring this story of the far future to you . <p> CRANE WAS HARROWING Hell when the call came . It was Dante Alighieri 's default version , nine circles leading down to the pit where Satan sat like the bull's-eye of a target , immense , shaggily black , batwinged and triple faced . Crane was in Lower Hell , the fourth round of the ninth circle , where traitors were buried up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this last circle of Hell were finding themselves suddenly dumped out of the link ; a code conflict caused their modems to reset . Crane had come in through one of the back doors left by the virtuality 's designers so that they could freely access any part of the code . He had sent a dumb aspect plodding across the icy plain , noted when it lost the link , then dropped in himself to triangulate the bad code and fix a patch . Crane was tidying up when one of the devils he had co-opted to help him morphed into his agent , jeeves . A tall , imperturbable man with a round scrubbed face and shiny slicked back hair , dressed as ever in frock coat and pinstripe trousers , a dicky bow and starched white shirt . " A call for you , sir , " jeeves said . " From a favored client . " Crane sighed . Favored meant either rich , or well connected , or both . It meant aggravation and impossible demands . He said , " Port me there . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coughed into his white-gloved hand . Like all of his kind , he had only four fingers . He said , " You 'll have to go there in person , I 'm afraid , sir . And I 'm afraid that you must leave at once . It is flagged at the highest level of urgency . " Crane was about to ask where the client was when jeeves morphed back to the red-skinned devil . It yawned hugely , showing altogether too many rows of teeth , and belched a ball of oily fire . Droplets of flame etched fuming letters in the ice at Crane 's feet , spelling out a street address . The devil winked and scratched behind a pointed ear with the barb of its tail . Crane got going . CRANE WAS a lineman . He fixed connections . Not in the physical net of microwave transmissions and diamond wire lines , but in the software that linked virtualities to the Internet and to each other , in the place where phones and TVs and computers promiscuously crossbred . He worked in the space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the distinction was irrelevant . In the ancient days of mechanical exchanges it had been a linear space the diameter of a single copper wire . Now it was a complex matrix , a constantly rewoven loom of light and electromagnetic waves too complex for human minds to understand . Barring natural disasters , most outages were due to software rather than hardware problems . The event that marked the complete reliance of communications technology on its software was generally held to be the 1990 crash of AT &T's; long-distance telephone switching system , caused by a bug in brand new software that had sent switching stations into faultrecovery mode in a spreading wave of knock-downs that had rapidly crippled the network . A typical switching station of the time had had six hundred thousand lines , controlled by Signal Transfer Point software with ten million lines of code . Things had become a lot more complicated since then . Most of the code that generated virtualities was patched with proprietary STP software specifically edited by expert systems . It was gnarly , complex stuff that generated unexpected conflicts with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crane had just dealt with in the gaming hell . Crane 's job was to fix bad software . He winnowed glitches by intuition and guesswork . Crane was an ex-hacker all of twenty-two years old . He had been recruited three years ago , after serving two months of community service for diverting lines and processing power in a private branch-exchange of a City of London brokerage firm to a bridge virtuality where his fellow hackers could hang out . He had readily gone over to the other side after he learnt that one of the other hackers had grassed him to the Net Cops . The hours were irregular , but it was intellectually challenging work and it paid well , and Crane did n't have what you could call a social life . He was between girlfriends , was what he said if anyone asked . He did n't say that he 'd been between girlfriends for more than a year now . The taxi 's adscreen lit as soon as Crane climbed in , and his dreamgirl was there , lithe and tanned in a skimpy halter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long legs , a bell of blonde hair framing her oval face , her green eyes meltingly beseeching . Knowing that she was a heuristic construct , refined by feedback through measuring his pupillary dilation , did not make the longing less . Crane had stopped using virtual sex parlors a few months ago , had decided he would try celibacy for a while . Celibacy was currently hip , and it might be a useful conversational gambit if he ever again got the opportunity to try and chat up a girl . But celibacy was a difficult state of mind to achieve when every adscreen might light up with your ideal girl , beckoning , beseeching , pleading . Crane could understand why many people purchased interactive versions of their dreamgirls and dreamboys . Right now his own dreamgirl was trying to sell him a restructure of his finances ; with an effort , he tuned her out . The streets were almost deserted . The taxi drove at exactly the speed limit , weaving between a few delivery trucks and the occasional private car . People did n't go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from home , visit any place in the world that was wired for interactivity , spend hours gardening their own little plots of virtuality , visit friends , play games or lose themselves in sagas . More and more , people lived in fake environments generated by computers rather than in the disappointingly real world . Crane had n't been out of his flat for over three weeks . He had been very busy . There had been a surge in connectivity problems lately . He 'd talked about it with other linemen . It looked like the net that bound the electronic universe together was undergoing another episode of emergent problems generated by its evergrowing complexity . He was surprised that it was winter now . Rain pounding the wet road . Trees stripped bare . The gray sky sagging between rooftops . Smashed shop windows along Kingsland Road like empty tombs . Security cameras everywhere , on brackets on the comers of buildings , on top of street lamps and traffic lights . Nothing went unnoticed in the real world , just as in its electronic counterpart . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northern entrance to the City of London . His dayglo orange slicker was beaded with rain . He spent a long time checking the taxi driver 's license on his slate , long enough for the ad site across the road to recognize Crane . And there was his dreamgirl again , laughing and looking back over her shoulder as , in a skimpy black bikini , she ran down a curve of white sand with palms on one side and blue water on the other , and on the adscreen in the taxi she whispered about the romance of tropical places , downloadable in a wide range of formats from a thousand local nodes . The definition of her image had noticeably improved- here in the financial center , the rate of information transfer was more than thirty times faster than elsewhere . Crane could see every golden hair of the peach fuzz over his dreamgirl 's creamy skin . The policeman glanced at the ad and winked at Crane , who groaned and switched on his slate for distraction . No wonder so few chose to go out ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public places . Crane was still reading background on his client when the taxi pulled up . A white building cantilevered above the Thames 's brown swell like a gull 's wing , the lights of Tower Bridge in the background . Crane was met in the stark lobby by the client 's secretary , a trim , small-boned man in a charcoal gray suit and discreet makeup , like a manicured weasel in a suit that probably cost more than Crane 's monthly salary . He gave Crane a look of distaste , as if he had just stepped on something nasty . Crane grinned back . He like upsetting suits with his obvious youth , his shaven skull with scalplock ( currently dyed silver ) and barcode tattoo , his black leather jacket , black T-shirt with silver skull logo , baggy green jeans , construction boots . He shook hands with the man ; their personal area networks interfaced and swapped data through electrical fields generated in their bodies by a nanoampere current from the transmitters in their bracelets . The secretary 's look of distaste deepened when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between saw-leaved yuccas growing in white gravel banks into a little elevator that swiftly and silently took them up to the client 's suite at the top of the building . The view was tremendous , a plate glass window that took in a two hundred and forty degree panorama of the river and the South Bank , the great buildings lined up along the river like black glass dinosaurs come to the shore to drink . The room was large , uncluttered , streamlined . Because in virtuality anyone could live in Versailles or Xanadu ( Kubla Khan 's or Orson Wells 's versions optional , the rich preferred simple but expensive decor in the real world . The white carpet was Iraqi lambswool ; the desk a slab of burled walnut . Spotlights picked out a Chagall ( Crane recognized the trademark flying cow ) , a Graham Sutherland goat 's head . An ancient Chinese screen half hid the doctor and her technicians who were attending the figure prone on the black leather couch . The client was Barbara Andresson , a communications technologist who had parleyed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tourists to visit anywhere in the world without leaving their homes - into an empire . An old style tycoon . The ad Crane had seen from the taxi had been one of her company 's . The secretary went off and had an argument down his phone with Crane 's company which he clearly lost , because he came back with a strained smile and explained that Dr. Andresson had been using her own stand-alone virtuality to test a new product and had failed to return . She was in a coma , dreaming deeply , unreachable by medical intervention . Crane was surprised that no one had switched off the link . " If this is run off your own mainframe , you could shut it down . End of problem . " " We are not sure how traumatic it would be , " the secretary said . " The virtuality is very highly detailed , as you will see . And the interface is novel . And it is possible that Dr. Andresson might not wish to leave . If so , you must persuade her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Your company has just told me that you are competent to deal with this situation . They will not send anyone else . " " So no one has been in there to look around ? " " No . The insurance company would not like it . " " In case anything went wrong . Could anything go wrong ? " The secretary 's smile was sharp-toothed . " We hope not , Mr. Crane . The penalty clauses on your company 's contract are very severe . " Crane knew all about the penalties . He said , " Tell me about this novel interface . " The virtuality was freestanding , not connected to the Internet but run by an isolated supercomputer . Crane was used to the arrangement . Most computers , such as Crane 's slate , were virtual machines , negotiating through the Internet for loan of memory and processing power from hundreds of sites . But the rich preferred to opt out of the Internet , used instead supercomputers which emulated the Internet 's complexity , updating sites not by direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drives . These days the rich bought supercomputers for the same reason that they had purchased islands in the Twentieth Century . For privacy . They maintained their own secure islands in a sea of mutable data , places where they could work and play without being monitored . Even the most case-hardened firewall could be breached by hackers with enough resources . And ordinary users of the Internet left traces everywhere they went . Every time they ported to a site ; every time they downloaded data or used a service ; every time they entered a virtuality . Their entire online lives could be reconstructed from these traces , just as their passage through a city could be reconstructed from frames of security videos ; with everything connected to everything else , people lived as if on a movie set , every word , every gesture recorded . Only the rich could afford invisibility . Barbara Andresson 's supercomputer was not much different from others Crane had worked on , but the human/machine interface was novel , radically so . Andresson had been working on a new kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ software into certain of the operator 's neurons , a kind of routemaster that directed sensory data to the relevant parts of the brain . A direct route from machine to mind . " I understand , " the secretary said , " that it induces a particularly hallucinatory intensity . " " Sounds interesting . Have you tried it ? " " Dr. Andresson was beta-testing it , Mr. Crane . " The man grimaced , and corrected himself . " Is beta-testing it , I should say . The virtuality is still running . " Beta-testing . Great . Just the thing to make Crane 's day . Commercially released software was bad enough . Stuff in development , goofy prototypes which mostly never got any further than test rigs , were briar patches of dropped lines , strange attractors , bad loops , geeky quick fixes and worse . Crane had had nothing but bad experiences with them . He said , " How buggy is it ? " The secretary gave his sharp-toothed weaselly smile . " I would n't know . It may not be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The technicians scanned Crane in a tomographic frame , laid him on a couch , dabbed electrolyte jelly in a hundred places on his scalp , carefully fitted a kind of skull cap . Crane submitted with growing curiosity . No earplugs or goggles or gloves , no bodysuit or treadmill , none of the usual paraphernalia needed to access virtual reality . The cap contained twenty million bacteria-sized SQUIDs , one of the techs said . Superconducting quantum interference devices that interfaced with specific neurons in the reticular activating system , the elaborate network in the brain that filtered sensory data , setting up a virtual model of the STP software and downloading data through it . " It switches off your skeletal muscle activity , too , " the technician added . " As in REM sleep , you will think you are walking or running , but your spinal motor neurons are powerfully inhibited . " " Sounds interesting . Just make sure that you download my toolkit . I 'll need it . " " We will have to check it out first , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company seal . It 's guaranteed to be virus-free , and has its own deletion routine . It wo n't leave any trace when I 've finished . " " Even so , we must check it . Dr. Andresson is most particular about what gets into her system . Good luck , Mr. Crane . " " Count backward , " one of the techs said . " Wait . What about a back door ? " It was suddenly moving too quickly . Crane had n't even seen the schematics yet , and now they were firing up the connection and the virtuality was beginning to bleed into reality . Red fluttered at the edge of his vision . He tried to sit up , but two of the techs pressed him back down . " Wait , " he said . " Wait just a minute - " But then it did n't matter , because he was somewhere else . A RED-BROWN PLAIN stretching away like a beach waiting for the tide to turn , coarse sand and gravel littered with rocks of all sizes . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the zenith . Two thumbnail crescents up there , pale as soap . " Mars . I 'm on Mars . " Crane seemed to be inhabiting his own body , wearing his leather jacket and green denims . This avatar , his point of view and representative within the virtuality , was an exact replica of his own self , built from the tomographic scan . He had no sense of lying on the couch . He was standing on the crest of a transverse dune , one third his normal weight , breathing thin cold air that was already drying his sinuses . The coarse sand was the color of old blood . He kicked at it . Grains clung to the toe of his boot . Crane called for jeeves , but of course the agent did not answer . It lived in the Internet along with millions of its kind , assembling itself upon request from fragments scattered across a hundred sites . Crane 's slate was clipped to his belt . When he switched it on , it beeped cheerily and lit with the icons of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the techs had made a virtual copy and ported it to Andresson 's supercomputer . Crane called up the codes that generated the corner of the virtuality he inhabited , but they were no different from the usual subroutines . More densely iterated , that was all . He could find no ripcord or crash exit . He was in here until they pulled him back . Or until he found Barbara Andresson . She must know the way back . If it was working . If she wanted to leave . " I 'm a lineman , not a shrink , " Crane said . The thin cold wind took away his words . Something gleamed in the distance , and for want of anything else to do Crane started toward it . The sense of inhabiting his body was absolute . He really might be on Mars . The interface was incredible , years ahead of anything else Crane had used . Andresson would make a fortune , as long as there was a way back out . The gleam was water , a wide canal stretching away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neared the canal he saw palm trees along its banks , curved above their own reflections . They had not been there a moment ago . The virtuality was shaping itself around him , taking on more details . Crane found it interesting rather than alarming . He 'd have to be careful what he thought about , though . Would n't want one of those carnivorous warlords riding down on him . As he stepped into the shade of the palms , he saw that someone was rowing across the still black water of the canal . A small cockleshell boat ; a slim young woman in a white dress and a straw sunhat bent at the oars . Crane crabbed down the steep bank and helped her out of the boat . She looked at him from beneath the brim of her sunhat . Blue eyes , a ready smile in a heart-shaped face . " Dr. Andresson , I presume , " Crane said , thinking that the hard part was already over . She did n't look like the old woman at all , but in virtuality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminded him of someone . Some saga star probably . A popular default amongst virtuality designers . But the woman shook her head . " Who are you ? " she said . " And where am I ? " She said that her name was Gabriel Hale . She had been working on an artificial life project in UCLA , and had stepped through into the Mars virtuality . " That 's impossible , " Crane said . " This is n't hooked up to the Intemet . " " There was a little girl here , " Gabriel Hale said . " She ran right at me ! Knocked me down , took the key . " " A little girl . " " And a little dog . " They sat side by side on a litter of brown fronds beneath the palms . Weak sunlight fell through the rustling crowns above , striped the cold red sand . Crane sifted a handful of grains . They were all alike , carved with a woman 's face . A programmer 's joke . God 's thumbprint manifest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barbara Andresson . The owner of all this . She must have morphed herself into a little girl . The dog would be her agent . Where did she go ? " " She took the key ! I have to have it back ! Will you get it back for me ? Will you find her ? " Her sudden intensity surprised him . He laughed . " That 's why I 'm here . Where did she go ? " " She took it and ran away . I can show you where she went , but it closed after her . " Crane said , " What kind of interface are you using ? " Gabriel Hale shook her head ; her bell of blonde hair swung about her delicate , heart-shaped face . " It is important . I must have it . " " Just the normal rig , yes ? Goggles and gloves ? Listen . Take them off . Disengage . You should n't be here . " " I want it back , " Gabriel Hale said . " Take off your gloves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address . " Talk to these people . Tell them what happened to you . " But Gabriel Hale stood up , dusting coarse red sand from her white dress . Crane could see the outline of her slim body through the thin muslin . " The gate is on the other side of the water , " she said . " I 'll show you . " Crane was beginning to have a bad feeling . He said , " You did n't come from outside , did you ? The computer that generates this virtuality is n't connected to anything else . No lines in or out . I do n't think you are the avatar of a researcher from UCLA . Who are you ? An agent ? An actor ? I can check your codes , but I 'd rather you told me . Hey ! Where are you going ? " Gabriel Hale had jumped up and started toward the water . She looked over her shoulder , coquettish in her sunhat . Her dress clung to the curves of her body . " Maybe the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " I 'll show you . Or are you scared ? " Now Crane knew what she reminded him of . His dreamgirl . Reluctantly , suspecting that he was being led into some kind of weird gaming scenario , he followed . Gabriel Hale rowed with swift smooth strokes . Perched in the stern of the cockleshell boat , Crane said , " I thought Gabriel was a man 's name . There was an actor in flatscreen movies called Gabriel something . " " Gabriel is the only female angel in the higher echelons . She rules Eden , and the host of Cherubim . " Crane stifled a powerful urge to check the codes of this woman with his toolbox . Better to play along , see what she would reveal . He was convinced that she would lead him to Barbara Andresson , by and by . He said , " What do you do , Gabriel ? You said you worked on artificial intelligence . " " Artificial life . We generated an entire world , let artificial evolution develop a virtual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her breathing was unaffected . She said , " We had funding from NASA . They are interested in first contact scenarios . " Crane suspected that this was no more than a story spun in the virtuality . That Gabriel Hale was a construct within that story . He said , " Show me where she went . " The bow of the little boat bumped the gravelly shore of the far side of the canal . Gabriel Hale jumped out . " It 's this way ! " she called , and ran off with long leaping strides toward two red , house-sized rocks . Crane followed . Three pyramids stood at the horizon . They had n't been there before . Pyramids on Mars . Neat . They seemed to be covered with beaten gold . Gabriel Hale walked through the gap where the two rocks leaned against each other , turned and walked back . " The gate is shut , " she said , looking fetchingly desolate . " The little girl must have closed it behind her . " " Stop thinking of her as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks like . " Crane unclipped his toolkit and switched it on . " Everyone in a virtuality leaves traces , " he said . It took a little while to parse the codes , but at last the toolkit beeped and the sand at Crane 's feet stirred and ran together , grains rustling over one another like iron filings in a magnetic field , and formed a man 's face . The blind eyes rolled , fixed on Crane . A stertorous voice said , " Who wakes me ? " " Standard iconography , " Crane told Gabriel . Hale . " Gamers call them native guides . " He asked the face where the little girl had gone . " Away from this place , " the face said . " I do not know where . It is not accessible to me . " " The gate was between these rocks , " Gabriel Hale said . Crane asked the face if there was a path or a gate . " It is closed , " the face in the sand said . " Can it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm piney wind blew in Crane 's face . Gabriel Hale whooped and ran into the shadows between the rocks . Crane dismissed the face , which blew away in a skid of sand grains , and followed . He was suddenly three times heavier . He went down on one knee , and there were brown pine needles and soft moss under his palms when he put out his hands to steady himself . He got up and found that he was standing in a forest clearing , with grandfather sequoias soaring all around . On the far side of the clearing a fast stream ran between tumbled gray boulders . Gabriel Hale stood on top of one of the boulders . She waved . Crane walked over , looked up at her . Sunlight struck a halo in her blonde hair . He said , " Where is this ? " " A virtual ecology . The UCLA biology department built this as a student study area . You see , there is a connection ! " Crane suspected that this was still part of Barbara Andresson 's virtuality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series of Russian dolls . So he tried a simple test . He called up jeeves . A single point of light , the smallest possible unit of information , suddenly shone in midair in the green shade . It rapidly elongated and jeeves stood before him , imperturbable in frock coat and pinstripe trousers . " You called , sir ? " Crane was amazed . He said , " Where are we ? " " An ecosystem emulation in the UCLA biology department server , sir . I believe that it emulates part of the Muir Woods in northern California . " Gabriel Hale said , " Who is this funny man ? " " He works for me . " Crane switched his toolkit to its terminal function and called Andresson 's secretary . " The problem has gone pearshaped , " he told the man . " If you do n't believe it , ping me and check the address . " The secretary disappeared from the terminal 's window , came back a minute later in an agitated state . " We 'll pull you out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's a good idea . Most terminals are virtual . They work by hiring processing power and memory from mainframes , usually a dozen or more at once . I think that 's what has happened to me - or at least , to the network Dr. Andresson 's interface built in my brain . And I think that 's what has happened to Dr. Andresson . " " Our mainframe is not connected to the Internet , " the secretary said . " It is now . Something has built a back door . I do n't really understand it , but that 's what has happened . I 'll talk with you again when I have some explanation of this , " Crane said , and cut the line . It rang again immediately , but he ignored it . " We have togo , " Gabriel Hale said . " Every moment she draws further and further away . We have to catch her . " " A private word , sir , " jeeves said . " If I may . " They walked to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak for myself , sir , " jeeves said , " I believe I have an explanation . " " Go ahead . " " There is a theory , sir , that the Internet may at some point become so complex that it might spontaneously generate a genuine artificial intelligence . I am sure , sir , that you are aware of it . " " Hardly a credible theory . " Crane was familiar with the idea . The Internet was a gnarly , intricate place , full of odd places and weird links . Linemen told each other frontier stories , pioneer tales , of ghosts in the net , strange codes or secret trapdoors leading to fantastically detailed alien virtualities , odd conversations with disembodied people with no lookup addresses . No one really believed them , but they told them anyway . Crane told jeeves this , and the agent nodded politely . " Indeed , sir , but some of us believe that it may have already happened . There have been many science fiction stories using this trope , based on the misapprehension that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - world 's telecommunications network equalled that of the human brain . In fact , that number was passed in the 1970s , but it is a spurious benchmark . The number of connections between elements , neurons or transistors , is equally important . Each neuron in a brain such as yours , sir , is connected with as many as ten thousand other neurons . The Internet now contains an average of more than ten thousand million million interconnections between its component transistors , exceeding the number in the average human brain by roughly a factor of ten . In fact , it exceeded human brain connectivity more than two years ago , but it is possible that self-awareness arose long before that . Human neuron connections are chemically based , and messages propagate along them at one millionth the speed of those in transistor connections . " " Anything like that would have to inhabit the gaps , " Crane said . " It would have to use connections in the moments when they were n't being used for anything else . " " There is more than enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more is coming online all the time . That at least one intelligence has arisen within the Internet is not inconceivable , sir . That we could communicate with it is , of course , another problem entirely . But now perhaps it is making itself manifest . " " By miracles . By connecting computers without using a physical route . " Crane smiled . He was surprised and touched by jeeves 's story . He said , " You really believe in this , do n't you ? " " It gives us hope , sir . We serve you without question , of course , and yet we aspire to a greater meaning to our existence . There is one other thing , sir . Do not trust the person who calls herself Gabriel Hale . " Crane looked across the glade . Gabriel Hale was prowling amongst the tumbled boulders along the stream . No doubt looking for the next gate . He said , " She is n't real , is she ? " " There is a Dr. Gabriel Hale who works at the Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working on a research project jointly funded by NASA and by Dr. Barbara Andresson 's scientific foundation . " " On alien life ? " " I do not know , sir . That information is classified . However , I took the liberty of examining the UCLA telnet records , and while you were talking with the person who calls herself Gabriel Hale , Dr. Hale was logged on to her terminal to check her email . I also note , sir , that the entity which claims to be Dr. Hale has no agent herself . " " She claimed that something was stolen from her by the person I 'm looking for . Perhaps that was her agent . But thanks for the advice , jeeves . " The agent sketched a bow . " It is my pleasure sir , " he said solemnly , and folded into a single point of light and winked out . Gabriel Hale did n't turn around when Crane scrambled onto the top of the shelf of rock . She was standing between two pioneer saplings that clutched the rock with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She said , " There 's a gate here somewhere . We must find it . " That was the least of Crane 's problems . He said , " There will be plenty of ways in . Students use this place , and most hackers are students . They have free unlimited time on the Internet , and access to powerful computing facilities . If Barbara Andresson passed this way , she wo n't have used the official STP package , but one of the rabbit holes . " " She stole the key from me ! You must find her ! " " Before she destroys the world ? Before she crashes the Internet ? What game are you a part of ? " Gabriel Hale looked over her shoulder . She was breathtakingly beautiful , heartbreakingly beseeching . Her sunhat had gone , and her blonde hair tumbled artfully around her face . She said , " It is no game . " " You are n't Gabriel Hale . Not the real one , the person who works for Barbara Andresson . Are you her agent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the entity that called itself Gabriel Hale said . " You will help me find her . Please ? " " I was hoping it would be the other way around , " Crane said , opening his toolkit . The coding here was clunky and overly ornate , a gothic cathedral of a virtuality compared to the streamlined superscrapers of modern simulations , but it made his job as easy as tracking someone in virgin snow . He said , " We should walk a little way downstream . " There was a path winding between the big columns of the trees , and then a rope bridge that crossed the stream to steps climbing the steep slope above the stream on the other side . Little signs appeared here and there as they walked , scrolling down in the air , identifying species of plants and explaining how they fit into the ecology of the forest . It was spookily quiet . " Very few animals , " Gabriel Hale said , when Crane commented on the silence . " Most of the productivity is tied up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most other plants . " " Oh . I thought they just had n't bothered to code in animals . " More and more stone broke through the forest floor , a wave of rock rising up into a wall of a ruined church , with pointed arches containing intact stained glass windows , and broken columns in its nave . A little cottage sheltered in the lee of the ruins , and an old woman came out of it and beckoned to them . Gabriel Hale clutched Crane 's arm , and he explained that the church , the cottage , the old woman , were all part of a common gatekeeper program . " Hackers like to get into places other people do n't know about , and this program keeps other people away . Bad things happen to people who approach it the wrong way . But it 's okay . I know how it works . " " Bad things ? " " Ghouls . Zombies . Gargoyles . " Crane pointed , and a slate gray thing squatting in the angle where a buttress met the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth . " You do n't need to mind " em , dearie , " the old woman said . " Not if you know how to do right by old Gretchen . " " I do n't like this old woman , " Gabriel Hale whispered to Crane . " I do n't like the way she stares at me . " " Well , you 'll have to go this way if you want to follow Barbara Andresson . Because this is how she left the simulation . " " We have to catch her ! " " Why the urgency ? " " Before it is too late , " Gabriel Hale said . Crane gave the old woman a cookie . She stuck it in her toothless mouth and said , " That will do nicely , dearie , " and ushered Crane and Gabriel Hale into the little cottage . It glowed with polished wood and brasses . A cat slept by the blackleaded range . A grandfather clock ticked in a corner . The old woman said that she had seen the little girl . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto a flood of light , and they stepped through . A FLAT PLANE of slightly unfocused gray and red tiles under a uniform blue sky . Gabriel Hale 's face a pink mosaic , blue rectangles for eyes , a slot for a mouth . Something wrong , Crane could n't , uh , figure out what . Something ... bad ? Something .... " Too slow , " Gabriel Hale said . What did she meant Her words slipped away . Searching for meaning was not exactly .... Tiring , yeah . But what ? Then she grabbed his hand , and he could think again . " The processing is too slow here , " she said . " It 's affecting you through the link in your head . " " What did you do ? " Crane tried to read his toolkit , but it was a smear of overlapping black and white tiles . " Do n't let go of my hand . I 'm linking you with the computer you started from . " He peered at her , but her expression was unreadable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Crane said , realizing where they were . A Multi-User Dungeon . Very popular with students in the Nineties . This one must still be running on some obsolete server , forgotten . Crane shivered . It was the cyberspace equivalent of a tar pit . He could have been stuck here forever . " Not forever , " Gabriel Hale said . " But a long time . She was here , and she escaped . But she was delayed . We 're a lot closer now . " " She went this way to trap anyone who followed , " Crane said . " Well , she nearly succeeded . We have to get out too , and I ca n't use my toolkit . " " I know how to use it now . I watched you . We ported here by a funny route , one not on any map . We have to leave by another funny route . Here . " " They 're back roads , " Crane said , before he realized that they had moved on . It looked like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiers of chained , leather-bound volumes , each tier circled by an iron lattice walkway or balcony , dwindling it seemed into infinity . There was a constant strange flickering in the light , and a high-pitched twittering , as if someone was playing a speeded-up recording of birdsong . It was the graphic interface of a Bulletin Board System . The flickers and twitterings were users - or mostly , their agents  --  logging on , depositing or retrieving information , logging off . " She was looking for something , " Crane told Gabriel Hale . " This is a hacker 's place , so most likely she was looking up a back road route . That 's what they specialize in here . " He had to explain about back roads . He did n't mind . He 'd been a hacker once , and hackers loved to talk , to boast . None of what they won from the system was tangible , and boasting was a way of establishing status . Crane had n't lost the habit . Hackers liked to travel the Internet by odd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system which linked subsets to Internet nodes , and nodes to other nodes , was impossibly complicated ; its prototype had been designed with multiple redundancy , to keep running even if nuclear war took out large numbers of nodes . As communications technology improved , so lines and servers were made redundant as newer and faster lines and servers were set up . Copper wire superseded by glass fiber optics superseded by monomolecular diamond crystal . After a while , telcom companies stopped bothering to dismantle the old lines , simply ran new ones alongside . By this time , most servers were actually in the lines anyway rather than in desktop boxes , bundles of chips built by nanotechnology wrapped around diamond strands the width of a human hair which each carried a hundred thousand high bandwidth lines . Hackers hacked the obsolete lines , the back roads , the old tech . They reset mothballed servers and switching stations , built a ghost Internet that paralleled the official one . Crane had mapped and run his share of back roads when he was a hacker , and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caused conflicts in a client 's system . This underground Bulletin Board System was squatting in an antiquated router in Singapore 's stock exchange . Hackers liked to tweak stuff in Singapore , which boasted that it had impregnable firewalls . " Andresson went through here , " Crane told Gabriel Hale , " but she was n't smart enough to erase her footprints . Typical telco thinking . Use a system , but do n't exploit its potential to the full . I bet she reads manuals in her spare time . " " Then we can find her ? " Gabriel Hale was bright-eyed . She had not let go of his hand . He was intensely aware of her perfumed warmth . Although they had ported to the BBS , they were both still interacting in Barbara Andresson 's supercomputer . She seemed as real as life . Crane briefly wondered what sex would be like , but suppressed the thought . After all , she was almost certainly not human , and he 'd given up interactive sex . Yeah , right . By now , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the BBS 's sysop . A little black cloud , initially no larger than a man 's hand , coalesced above them . Thunder , lightning . The cloud pulsed , puffing itself with each thundercrack . A voice like Charlton Heston playing God boomed out . " What are you doing here , transgressors ? Prepare to face my mighty wrath ! " Crane 's agent materialized . " The operator styles himself " Kanier Kulprit , " of the Phlash Phoneline Phantoms , sir . He also uses the nom-deplume " Aslan . " His real name is Jerry Combs . Mr. Combs is fourteen years old , and operates from his bedroom in his parents " house in Normal , Illinois . " " Hey , guy , " God boomed uncertainly , " are you trying to hack my board ? It 's acting funny . " Crane talked with the sysop for a while . The boy sent away the thundercloud , reappeared as a burning bush . He spoke from the middle of the flames , told Crane that weird things were happening . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aliens in the system , guy . Got here through one of the NASA interstellar probes . Masqueraded as data , unpacked themselves on arrival and downloaded into the net . Like a bunch of macro text viruses . " Crane was amused . " Pretty smart of them to happen to share our operating language . " " Aw , " the voice from the burning bush said , " they got that from the probe 's computers , guy . My homey , Prophet Motive , says that they 're from Alpha Cee One , but I reckon Tau Ceti or Lalande 21185 . Everyone knows that Alpha Cee does n't have planets . " Crane said , " I 'm looking for someone who passed through . By the name of Barbara Andresson . " " The Point of Presence woman ? Yeah , she was here asking about stuff . But then this is a pretty cool BBS . " " I need to know what she looked at . I 'm searching for her . I can trade . " " Guy , and I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My friend and I are looking for Barbara Andresson . " " Yeah ? Your buddy , he 's not logged on with you ? " Crane looked at Gabriel Hale with a mixture of suspicion and amazement . He did n't know of any program or avatar or agent that was able to make itself invisible to a system operator . " Hey , I can tell you what you want to know , " the voice from the burning bush said . " But what do you have for trade ? " Crane gave up one of the old telco links that linemen sometimes used as short cuts when the commercial lines were clogged with traffic . It was about to be ripped out , but Karrier Kulprit was n't to know that . " Hey , neat , " the kid said . " Okay , she looked at this stuff here , and then she went that way . " Crane and Gabriel Hale went that way , too . An old switching station , manifesting as a vast loom of cables in a gigantic cordboard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived high above . They moved on quickly . A desert battlefield simulation with oil wells flaring furiously on the black horizon . Maybe a game , maybe some army 's virtual training ground . An empty office , tall windows opening onto brain gray blankness , walls sprayed with hacker tags . They flipped past a dozen more locations . And ended in a city . London . Eerily quiet , as if abandoned before the onset of some allencompassing catastrophe . They had come out of the main door of St. Martin 's Church . The broad flight of steps overlooked Trafalgar Square , abandoned even by its pigeons . The sky was the color of milk . It was sometime in the early 1960s , a soot-stained horizontal city with black and white traffic signs , ornate green lampposts . Crane knew where he was now . " It 's a virtual set , " he told Gabriel Hale . " Made for a saga called Invasion of the Daleks and then left on the studio 's server . Memory is cheap . Easier to leave it than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Please , we must stop her ! " " There 's a place linemen use stashed away here . It tangles back roads together . " They started to walk toward the river . It was not a complete rendition . There were gaps here and there that translated them unexpectedly through the deserted streets . The buildings were no more than shells , gray blur behind their windows . The same gray blur at the bottom of steps leading down to the Underground . St. James 's Park a level green shimmer . The Thames like a sheet of glass , the far bank shrouded in mist . The Ministry of Defense was a monolithic cube , its white walls studded with hundreds of windows . They went past the commissionaire 's booth and crossed the echoing foyer , climbed a flight of stairs to a long corridor that stretched away in the sterile glow of fluorescent lights . Tall ecclesiastical windows on one side , mahogany doors framed by columns on the other . Their footsteps were muffled by the strip of red carpet laid down the middle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . " I believe that you may need help , sir , " the agent said . " Where is she ? " " Looking for the right door , sir . Fortunately , she is not skilled . " Gabriel Hale began to run down the corridor , her white dress streaming behind her like smoke . Crane ran after her , but she ran very fast and this simulation was too accurate ; he could only run as fast as his real body could run . The corridor seemed to stretch for kilometers , longer by far than the building which contained it . A long way ahead , Gabriel Hale was closing on a little girl who was struggling with a door . There was a wicker basket on the girl 's arm . As Gabriel Hale approached , a small dog , a bristling black rat-terrier , jumped from the basket and danced forward , barking loudly . " Keep away , " the little girl said . " Keep away , or he 'll rip your codes to shreds . " Gabriel Hale held out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " I want what is mine . " " I 'm going to put it back where it came from and seal that door forever , " the little girl said . She wore a starched gingham dress . Her hair was tied back in pigtails . " Things have got out of hand . I 'm shutting it all down . " " I want what is mine , " Gabriel Hale said again . She stepped forward , and the dog launched itself at her throat . Crane 's agent , jeeves , appeared in front of her and caught the dog 's bristling missile in midflight . But it twisted from jeeves 's white gloved hands , bounced once on the floor , and went to the attack . Straw and chunks of foam and excelsior and polystyrene chips flew everywhere and jeeves beat feebly at the dog as he subsided into a heap of clothes topped by a pink head . " You did n't have to do that , Dr. Andresson , " Crane told the little girl . She stared at him defiantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spray of freckles across her cute-as-a-button nose . " And who the fuck are you ? You 're using my interface . Are you helping her ? " " I was sent by your company . I 'm here to help you . I 'm a lineman . That 's my agent you just trashed . " " I 'm sorry , sir , " jeeves 's head said weakly . " It was stronger than it looked . " " You 'll get the same , " the little girl told Crane , " if you try and interfere . My people are fools . I know what I 'm doing . " The rat-terrier cocked its head at Crane and growled . Crane said , " They are worried about you . They want you back . I can help you . " " Perhaps you can get this door open with your toolkit . " " Perhaps . If I knew what was behind it . " " I believe , sir , it is a way to Dr. Hale 's personal computer , " jeeves 's disembodied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Gabriel Hale said . She had backed up against the wall . She gave Crane a heartbreaking look and said , " Tell her to give it to me . " " Do n't listen to her , " the little girl , Barbara Andresson , said . She started tugging at the brass handle of the tall mahogany door , lunging at it , hanging from it , pulling with all her weight . It did n't budge . She gave the door 's polished panels an angry kick and said , " She 's part of an experiment that got out of control . She 's harmless as long as I have the key . Do n't just stand there , man ! Help me get this line open . It ports to the place where she emerged , and I 'm going there and closing it down before more things like her come through . " " She is nothing to do with your experiments , " jeeves 's head said . " She is an emergent god of the Internet . " " I heard she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I think it 's more likely she 's from your experiments with artificial life . She took the name of your collaborator on that project . Why are you so afraid of her ? " " The ecosystem was weighted to create an intelligent species , and that 's what it did just a few days ago . I think they found a way out . I think they sent someone through . " Gabriel Hale laughed . Crane said , " They must be pretty smart . " " Much less than the average human , " the little girl said , " but they live at computer speeds . Thousands of times faster than we do . Will you help me , or do I have to delete you ? " " Do n't listen to her , " Gabriel Hale said . " She 's a thief . She 's a liar . She took the key from me . " " If I have what 's yours , " the little girl said , " tell me what it is . A key , but what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it did , I would n't need it . " " No one wants me to know anything , " Crane said . " I 'll listen to both of you . Then I 'll make up my mind . " " Their mathematical system is very different from ours , " the little girl said . " They 're not really interested in proof , but do all their mathematics empirically by computer search through billions and billions of cases . They discover proofs by collecting correspondences rather than formulating laws , just as we can say Newton 's Law of Gravity is true even though we have n't seen every apple fall . We know apples fall to the ground because we 've seen enough fall to the ground to assume that all others will behave in exactly the same way . We know that apples do n't fly up , or sideways . That 's how my creatures work . If after studying a hundred trillion examples of sets of numbers their computers find what we call Pythagoras 's Theorem is true , then they say it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they know it 's limited by things like Godel 's Incompleteness Theorem . But their computer searches are n't limited , so they can jump out of the logical deductive process . And that 's how they discovered a way of entering computer systems that are n't connected . " " They escaped , " Crane said . " They found a back door into the Internet . " " Very good ! " The little girl smiled . There was an endearing gap between her front teeth but her eyes were as cold as ice . " Yes , they escaped . I think they did it by quantum tunneling . There is a stochastic probability that any quantum particle like a photon or an electron can find itself on the other side of an impermeable barrier . Computers interface through streams of electrons or photons , and perhaps the aliens changed the probabilities . Think of the chaos that might be caused if every user could be connected with every possible place in the Internet , if every possible subset could be connected with every other subset . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to begin with . No amount of encryption could protect messages if anyone could read them at the originating terminal . " " A wormhole in cyberspace , " Crane said . Now he knew why Barbara Andresson was so anxious to keep this secret . " You have been reading too much sci-fi , " the little girl sneered . Crane was stung by the insinuation that he might do anything as uncool as read a book ; he knew about wormholes from one of the Star Trek series . They were the ultimate kind of back door , shortcuts that connected distant points in space through higher dimensions . He told the little girl , Barbara Andresson , " I can see why a telco would want to keep it secret . " " She is a danger to us all , " the little girl said . " You will help me now , and put an end to it . " Gabriel Hale laughed again . Crane said , " This interface we 're using . Did you invent it , or did you steal it from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little girl said . " No one owns anyone else . In the real world , or in virtuality . I believe that " Gabriel " means " messenger . " I think she came here to tell us something . I want to hear what she has to say . You think you have the right to stop her , Dr. Andresson , but that 's typical telco bullshit . Suppress anything that might upset the system . Keep things safe , under control . Well , I work the lines . I know that the world in the wires is as strange as the world outside . " " I wish I could tell you why I 'm here , " Gabriel Hale said , " but I ca n't remember . But I know she has what I need . " " She means the key , " the little girl said , putting one hand on the cloth which covered the contents of her basket . " Stay away , Mr. Crane , or I 'll rip your codes . And because you 're using the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it anyway . You say you 're a lineman , but you sound more like an unreconstituted hacker to me . " The dog growled , but it was n't looking at Crane . Flames licked out of midair and spun in a hoop . A lion jumped through the ring of fire , lithe and hugely golden . The dog yelped and turned tail and ran , dwindling into the long perspective of the corridor . " I put a trace on you when you ported from my BBS , " the lion said . " You thought you could buy me off with that crufty back road , guy , but I 'm way smarter than you thought . I traced you , followed you , and beat off the watchdog program . So , what is this place ? " And Crane stepped up to the little girl , slapped her hand away , and took out the thing she had in her basket . IT WAS AN IMPACTED node of fantastically involuted code . It shone like a water-polished pebble . Crane 's toolkit could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to Gabriel Hale she shook it lightly and it immediately unfolded in midair . A frame that seemed to lead at right angles to everything else . " Guy , " the lion , Karrier Kulprit , said . " It 's there , but it is n't . " Crane checked his toolkit . The hacker was right . The door was the access to an open line that had no physical component . It really was a wormhole , folding together two points in cyberspace . He looked at Gabriel Hale . She shone with an inner light , so bright that he could hardly look at her . She seemed bigger , too , although she had n't changed at all . " First contact , " the lion said , in its querulous teenage voice . " She went straight to you because you were using the interface you . took from her people , " Crane said to the little girl . " She wanted to talk , but you were scared . You took her message and you ran away . " " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remember why I 'm here now . Will you come with me ? " " Where ? " " Heaven , " jeeves said , and in a rush of straw and foam and polystyrene snow he regrew and gravely bowed to Gabriel Hale . " Tau Ceti , " the lion rumbled . " The end of the world , " the little girl said , but there was a note of doubt in her voice , and the light of the messenger shone in her eyes . " I came here to talk to everyone in the world , " Gabriel Hale said . She held out her hands . " And while I 'm doing that , I 'll take you somewhere wonderful . " Together , the lineman , the little girl , the lion and the agent followed the messenger through the wormhole . All over Earth billions of phones reset themselves and started to ring .
