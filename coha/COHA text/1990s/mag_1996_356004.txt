Paisley Park , a lavishly weird recording complex just west of Minneapolis , Minnesota , is exactly the kind of place you 'd expect to be owned and operated by a lavishly weird recording star like Prince . The wildly talented singer-songwriter does n't go by the name of Prince anymore , of course ; in 1993 he changed his name to the unpronounceable glyph symbol for the artist formerly known as Prince , and now most people call him either " the artist formerly known as Prince " or , more familiarly , " the Artist . " <P> The latter , one quickly learns , is correct usage among employees at Paisley Park , a workplace that seems to have just about everything but llamas . The walls are ringed by zodiac signs , dotted by paintings of puffy clouds and gilded with the Artist 's gold records . High up on one wall is an illustration of two huge eyes  --  guess whose ?  --  with a godlike sunburst beaming out from between them . The Artist 's private office has a papal portentousness to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And when the Artist is on the premises , a glass pyramid that crowns the complex glows with a purplish light . That is how ye shall know he is among us . <P> But pretentious quirkiness without the platinum popularity to back it up can begin to feel a little Norma Desmondish , and the Artist has been suffering from dwindling sales for almost a decade . Purple Rain ( 1984 ) sold 13 million copies ; his last album , Chaos and Disorder ( 1996 ) , did n't even sell 100,000 . But this week the performer who defined ' 80s glam-pop and helped pioneer rock-funk fusion is attempting a comeback . Having extricated himself from his contract with Warner Bros . Records ( a pact he so despised he started writing slave on his cheek ) , the Artist is releasing a triple CD titled Emancipation , the first in his new deal with EMI . While the album 's overall import falls well short of that of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution , it does have its moments . <P> The famously reclusive performer is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a TIME reporter ( who ducked the question of what one calls the Artist to his face by not calling him anything ) to talk about his new album , his new contract , his new wife , his new child and all the newness in general that surrounds him lately . In person he seems more fragile than one might expect , with his thin frame and delicately eyelined eyes . When he speaks , his voice is deep and soft . " This record is very personal to me , " he says about Emancipation , a 36-song , three-hour-long epic . " I got everything out of my system with it . When I wrote it , I was a free man and a happy man and a clear man . You 'll hear much more clarity and joy in it . " But was a triple album really necessary ? " I let the music dictate what I want , " says the Artist . " Citizen Kane is a long movie ; maybe this is my Citizen Kane . I 've got nobody to answer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've ever done .
