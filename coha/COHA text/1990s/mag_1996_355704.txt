Mesa Air Group , the largest independently owned commuter airline in the U.S. , has long caught heavy flak for its mechanical glitches , overbooking and pervasive incompetence . The company fired five workers last summer after a co-pilot 's girlfriend ( also a Mesa employee ) took the cockpit jump seat on a flight from Casper , Wyoming , to Denver , forcing an off-duty pilot to occupy the plane 's only bathroom . But last week Mesa agreed to fly right by signing a Federal Aviation Administration order requiring the carrier to improve its operations and pay a $500,000 fine . The FAA will halve the penalty if fast-growing Mesa meets deadlines for steps ranging from improving crew training to adding more flight and maintenance personnel . <P> Mesa 's critics include two Colorado Republicans , Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell and Congressman Scott McInnis , who want Congress to launch its own probe of the airline . Both lawmakers are frequent flyers on United Express , one of six Mesa divisions that provide feeder service to USAir , United Airlines and America West . Campbell was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to crank down the landing gear manually after it became jammed on the approach to Denver . <P> Mesa chairman Larry Risley attributes such problems to the delayed delivery of new planes in the face of soaring passenger demand . The 16-year-old New Mexico-based carrier operates 2,000 flights a day to 166 cities in 30 states . Borne aloft by the industry 's good times , Mesa had strong profit growth in the second quarter . Yet Risley concedes that " we fell short of customers ' expectations , " and he vows to do " whatever it takes " to improve service . Apparently , it takes an FAA order . <P>  --  By John Greenwald .
