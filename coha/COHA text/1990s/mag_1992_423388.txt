<p> Last year , more than one million cosmetic procedures were performed on Americans . Once exclusively for the rich , an increasing number of middle-class Americans are getting skin-tightening and fat-removing cosmetic procedures . Although traditionally more women have sought cosmetic surgery , men are catching up ; today nearly one out of every three cosmetic operations is performed on a man . Increased demand for these procedures has led to increased competition among surgeons , and many have turned to radio ads , toll-free telephone numbers , and glossy brochures to attract customers . As a result , consumers need to be savvy when selecting a surgeon . <p> The Doctor 's Qualifications <p> Depending upon which type of cosmetic surgical procedure you want done , different kinds of physicians may be qualified to perform the job . Two terms the cosmetic-surgery-seeking consumer will probably come across ( and may be confused by ) are " cosmetic " and " plastic " surgery . A cosmetic surgeon is a specialist in surgical procedures that enhance one 's looks , such as breast reductions/enlargements , facelifts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a doctor trained in reconstructive surgery such as hand surgery , skin grafts , cleft palate repair , and other procedures to help the individual function better . Plastic surgeons are also trained in cosmetic surgery . <p> Many consumers prefer plastic surgeons because they have been trained in general surgery as well . Surgeons other than plastic surgeons may or may not be trained in general surgery . <p> Another specialist you may encounter is the otolaryngologist . This physician has had training in the stucture and physiology of the head and neck , disorders of the ears , nose , and throat , and can perform reconstructive and cosmetic surgery of the face , head , and neck . <p> Board-Certification . A mind-boggling number of medical organizations ( often known as a board , society , or association ) has evolved that certify a physician is competent . You must be able to separate the meaningful documents from the " wall decorations . " In general , it 's important to distinguish between two words : boards and academies . <p> A board evaluates the level of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examination ( typically there are written and oral components to the exam ) . Most boards have several requirements including the completion of a formal residency training program in a designated field . Physicians who pass the exam are considered " board certified " in the medical specialty in which they were tested . Although board certification does not ensure the competency of the physician , it is one indicator of a well-trained physician . You can confirm your physician 's certification by contacting your county medical society or state medical board . <p> Since there are many boards that certify physicians , and different boards may have different qualifications and standards for potential candidates , you should know what each board requires of its applicants ( see chart , pg . ) . <p> An academy ( as well as an association or society ) , on the other hand , serves an educational purpose ; it typically offers seminars and workshops to develop the physician 's skill further in a particular field . Membership in an academy may or may not mean that a physician has been continuing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signify that dues have been paid . <p> How can the consumer determine whether a particular board is legitimate and qualified to test applicants ? Many physicians feel that only American Board of Medical Specialties ( ABMS ) approved boards are legitimate . A book called the Directory of Medical Specialists , which may be found in many public libraries , lists the names of surgeons who are board-certified . <p> What to Look For In a Surgeon <p> Experience . Regardless of surgical specialty , one of the most important pieces of information you 'll need to uncover is the amount of experience the surgeon has had with the specific procedure you want performed . Find someone who has performed hundreds-if not thousand f procedures of the type you want done , and comes highly recommended ( from someone you trust ) . For example , if you are considering a collagen injection ( a procedure performed to smoothen wrinkled lines or make certain areas appear more full ) , a surgeon who has performed hundreds of rhinoplasties ( nose jobs ) may not necessarily be proficient at collagen injection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the specific procedure that you desire . <p> Evidence of Continued Training . Try to establish that the surgeon has continued training since his residency . One example of the need for continuing education is liposuction . Since liposuction was not introduced in the United States until 1982 , surgeons who have completed a residency program before then probably were not trained in liposuction , although they may be highly trained in other cosmetic procedures . These surgeons would need to have completed courses , workshops , or residency programs to develop skill in the liposuction proceedure . <p> Openness . Your surgeon should put the operation in perspective for you . Potential side effects-such as bruising , swelling , pain , and infection-should not be glossed over . Your surgeon should explain both expected and potential side effects in a practical manner . No surgical procedure is risk-free ; your surgeon should identify the potential risks and the probability of their occurrence . In addition , your surgeon should be open about referrals . Ask to speak with some of the patients on whom he has performed surgery . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at it , he wo n't mind . <p> Answers Your Specific Questions . You have every right to ask specific questions , such as , " Would you use general or local anesthesia in my case ? " ( Some surgeons use general anesthesia simply because it is more convenient for them , but it is often riskier for you . If your surgeon prefers to use general anesthesia , ask him why he chooses this method . ) <p> Encourages and Is Responsive to Self-Disclosure . This means a surgeon should try to determine why you want the procedure . Good surgeons typically inquire why you want a particular procedure ; they may , for example , be trying to uncover whether you want to look better to satisfy yourself or to become the president of your company . The former is a realistic goal ; the latter will probably lead to disapointment . Seek a surgeon who asks you about your motivations for and expectations from surgery . <p> Hospital Privileges . You want a surgeon who has hospital operating room privileges ( even if your particular procedure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not issue rights to just any physician ; hospitals require physicians to meet several criteria before they are allowed to perform any surgical procedures there . This is an additional although certainly not foolproof-assurance of your physician 's capability . <p> Hospitals are accredited ( you want to deal with only accredited hospitals ) by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations ( JCAHO ) , which assesses hospital quality . Check with the credentials committee at the hospital to determine whether your potential surgeon has hospital privileges . ( The JCAHO is located at 875 N. Michigan Ave. , Chicago , Ill. 60600 ; ( 312 ) 642-6061 . ) <p> <p> Chart is currently unavailable in data . <p> By Jeff Schein <p> <p> Mr. Schein , a contributing editor to CR , writes frequently on medical issues . <p>
