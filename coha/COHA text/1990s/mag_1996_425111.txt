Deciding how and when to get your child on skis is a lot different now than when I started skiing in the early ' ' 60s . As soon as my feet fit into my neighbor 's old boots , my parents figured , it was time to start . I happened to have big feet , so I started early , at age four . Maybe too early : All I wanted to do was sit in the base lodge and eat doughnuts . Nowadays , getting kids started is a lot simpler for parents  --  and for kids . With modern technology and special ski-school programs , kids can start earlier and more easily . Bindings and boots are easier to get into and out of , and skis are easier to turn . And skiwear is warmer and lighter . Even lifts are getting kid-friendly : Increasingly , ski areas are using conveyer-belt lifts , which require no more effort than just standing there . In the old days , I remember getting launched by a poma lift , spun backward , and then dumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun , but now kids are more likely to find adventure in a lesson than on the lift . ) Today 's ski schools make the learning experience fun , with adventure trails through the woods , terrain parks , obstacle courses , and maybe even a life-sized pink rabbit on skis . This is all good news for parents who want their kids to love the sport they love . But you probably have lots of questions about getting started . Here are the 12 questions I was most frequently asked as an instructor . Those of you who remember your first days on the slopes with apprehension , cringing at the idea of rope-tow burn and frozen safety straps , relax  --  you 'll see by the answers , learning to ski is child 's play now . 1 . How do I know if my child is ready ? As soon as your kids are willing and able , it 's time . They should show an interest in skiing . You can spark it by looking at pictures and videos of skiing and by talking about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company of people other than Mom and Dad . And finally , kids can start when they are physically ready  --  when they can walk around by themselves while wearing ski boots and bundled up in skiwear . Although there are many three- and four-year-old skiers , in general , the best age to start is around five or six . At this age , children are strong enough to move their equipment around and are more comfortable in group situations . Some ski schools , like Vail , add " potty trained " to the criteria list . Most all-day programs do n't do diapers ; however , in a one-hour private lesson , it probably wo n't make much difference . 2 . Should I rent or buy gear ? Because of the seemingly endless growth spurts that children go through , renting is almost always cheaper than buying . Many ski shops have introduced trade-as-you-grow programs , where you buy what you need the first season , then exchange it for the next size up the following year  --  for a fraction of what it would cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's probably a good idea to rent from a slopeside shop the first time , just in case something goes wrong with the bindings or the boots do n't fit . If possible , rent the night before , so you avoid the crowds and you have one less thing to think about in the morning . Depending on how much skiing you have planned for the winter ( be warned , this may be entirely different from what your child has in mind ) , you can rent by the day or by the season . 3 . Do ski poles help or hinder ? For new skiers ( even adults ) , poles have a tendency to get in the way , even to promote bad habits . And for kids , with their small hands , poles can be hard to hold on to . Before you rent or buy poles , check with the ski school to see if poles will be used in your child 's class . Of course , it 's human nature to want what you ca n't have . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my child wear a helmet ? Although helmets are n't required at ski areas , it seems all the cool kids are wearing brain buckets these days . Because helmets are worn for other activities , like biking and in-line skating , they 're readily accepted by kids . Just remember that the hard shell might protect your kid 's noggin from an errant T-bar , but it wo n't make him or her invincible . A proper fit is important ; if the helmet 's too big , it could do more harm than good . 5 . What can I expect my child to learn ? Hmmm , could there be a hidden agenda here ? Do you want your child to enjoy the slopes or to become the youngest member of the U.S. Ski Team ? As parents , your own expectations can get in the way of your child 's good time . Do n't expect too much too fast , and you 'll be pleasantly surprised . That said , kids learn at different rates . Some four- to five-year-olds will learn how to stop on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may learn faster because of greater strength and coordination . But age is n't always the determining factor . A big , strapping extroverted five-year-old could excel faster than a shy six-year-old featherweight . The weather , snow conditions , motivation , and group dynamics all play a role in your child 's progress . Just remember , skiing is not nuclear physics . If junior is having a ball making snow pies at the bottom of the hill , do n't sweat it . As long as kids are having fun , they will want to come skiing again ( which means you 'll get to go skiing again ) . They 'll get around to the actual skiing part eventually . 6 . Do kids learn better in weekly , half-day , or hourly lessons ? That depends  --  all of the above have advantages . With four- to six-year-olds , it 's a good idea to start with a one-hour group lesson , because a full day can be overwhelming . On the other hand , if a child is up to it , full-day programs are great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other kids . If you want to spend some family time on the hill , go with a half-day program . If your youngster shows solid interest in skiing , check out a week-long program at your vacation destination or a season-long series of lessons at a local hill . Just like adults , kids need mileage to get better . 7 . Will my child learn faster with private lessons ? Your best bet is to start with a group lesson and see what the instructor recommends for the future . Children often learn better when surrounded by peers doing the same thing . Learning , like laughter , can be contagious in a group . And between group daycare and school , most kids are comfortable in group settings . Still , there are kids who need special attention , so do n't rule out a private lesson . Just remember that privates are more expensive . Whether the extra expense is justified depends on how your child learns best . 8 . What goes on during a lesson ? As John Alderson of the PSIA National Junior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a lesson : play , drill , and adventure . " Instructors are armed with games and activities that teach through play , and playing is what kids do best . A game of Duck , Duck , Goose , for one , gets kids used to moving around in heavy ski boots , and the up-and-down movements help them learn to get up after a fall . ( And we all know how important that is . ) Playing tag with one ski on is great for building up balance . During the drill period , kids usually practice things that were introduced during the play period , like straight running , stopping , and turning . Adventure could mean an obstacle course , a terrain garden with rolls and ridges , or exploring a nature trail through the woods , all of which help get kids more balanced and comfortable on skis . 9 . What happens when ski-schoolers are n't on the slopes ? Not even a four-year-old can ski nonstop from 8 A.M. to 4 P.M. R &R; is important for both the muscles and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ games and drills indoors , like crawling around in ski boots in a big jungle gym . Kids might come inside for lunch , a hot-chocolate break , even an ice-cream party . And they might spend time learning about local history and mountain ecology , or filling in a ski-related coloring book . In a way , kid 's ski school is like going to camp . You do n't do the same thing every minute , but all of the activities are related . 10 . When can I ski with my child ? The best time is after a lesson . Ask the instructor where you should ski with your child . Do n't be disappointed if it 's somewhere pretty tame . If junior did n't take the high-speed quad 2,000 feet to the summit in his lesson , he 's probably not ready to go there with you . Kids love to ski with their parents and show off what they 've learned ( until they 're 12 or so , that is ) . Keep your expectations in check and compliment any new-found skills ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 11 . What if all my child wants to do is sit and eat doughnuts ? This option was not very well received when I was young ; I never ate my dinner . No one wanted to sit inside with me , either . Nowadays , for kids like I was , there are plenty of nonskiing programs for young and even older children  --  indoor childcare , ice-skating , sleigh rides , and more . But before you hang up your kid 's skis , find out why doughnut eating seems more fun : Is your child willing and able ? Does he understand that spending the day in ski school is not forever ? Can he follow directions ? Does he function well in a group situation ? Is he dressed properly ? ( See packing list at left. ) 12 . What should I look for in a resort ? Look for a resort that has something for everyone in your family : a daycare facility for young nonskiers , activities for doughnut eaters , skiing and snowboarding programs for different ages . ( Not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , your condo or hotel will be convenient to the ski school . The school will also have a rental shop , ski shop , and lift-ticket window under one roof or one-stop shopping . Find out if the mountain has any sections designed for kids . At Bolton Valley , Vermont , for instance , there 's an adventure trail through the woods with mazes , hideouts , bumps , and a sign at the top that warns : No ADULTS ALLOWED UNLESS ACCOMPANIED BY A CHILD . Vail prints an adventure map that identifies several cool places on the mountain , like Slanderous Sam 's Hideout , the Gold Mine , and the Kid 's Corral . Also look for bargains . Hotels often team up with ski areas for family deals ( 12-and-unders stay and eat free , for example ) . And at many ski areas , six-and-unders ski free , while older kids ski cheap . And if you 're planning a trip during a holiday period or on a busy weekend , you might want to book ahead of time  --  not only your lodging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of brightly colored rubber with clamps on either end . Attached to ski tips , it keeps them together . It 's a great tool for little skiers who need help keeping their skis from crossing or doing the splits . But on steep terrain , kids tend to sit back and rely on the tube rather than their feet and legs . Plan to wean your kid off this helper ( remember pacifiers ? ) as soon as possible . Harnesses look and function a lot like dog leashes . They allow your child some freedom to move away from you and to test his own ability to slow down , turn , or stop in relative safety . But the steeper the terrain gets , the more your child may relay on you to hold him back . You can also use a Hoola Hoop like a harness . But terrain choice , again , is important . The more the child relies on his own body to do the work , the better . A Packing List for Parents * Ski socks that fit A big wrinkle inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast as anything else . And make it just one pair . Feet can get cold if there 's not enough air circulation inside the boot . * Long johns , T-necks , and fleece tops Layering is the best method for staying warm , dry , and comfortable in changing temperatures . * Snow pants and a parka These should be easy to get into and out of when it 's time for a potty break . * Hat and neck warmer Children need them for the same reason you need a hat and neck warmer . * Ski mittens Kids use their hands a lot to get up after falls and to make snowballs , so make sure their mitts are water-resistant and insulated . Mittens are warmer and easier to get into than gloves . * Kid-sized goggles and sunglasses Goggles keep the face warm and the vision clear . On sunny days , sunglasses keep small eyeballs from frying . * Waterproof sunscreen It should be at least SPF 15 ; the sun reflects off all that whiteness , and it 's even stronger at higher altitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than adults , so keep your child hydrated with lots of water or juice .
