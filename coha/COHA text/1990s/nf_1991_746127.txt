Much recent scholarship on Heraclitus has emphasized that the philosopher exploits recurring words in his terse sayings . The dok-words* were among his favorites , for example , as was psyche , soul , in some innovative usages . The great Ephesian philosopher also enjoyed drawing sharp , verbal images borrowed from contemporary life , some of them memorable even to the modern reader . Words and images can , in turn , " resonate " between contexts when they appear in several fragments. 1 One example , a recurring word ( both as noun , martures , and verb , marturei ) and image concerns marturia , witnessing as a formal legal action . The chosen terminology of Heraclitus and the scene it evokes are borrowed from the local courts . In this feature the witness sayings bear comparison to earlier well-known examples from Milesian Anaximander ( " they give dike and tisis to each other , " judgment and compensation ) 2 and Athenian Solon , who imagines himself summoning Mother Earth as his eyewitness at a future trial where he will defend his accomplishments. 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , because modern interpreters , repeating a mistake of early historians of archaic Greek law codes , assume that " witness " and " witnessing " refer to an action familiar from modern courts , the testimony of the accidental witness . For example , X , a reputable citizen , by chance happens to be at a certain corner when A assaults B. Later , as a disinterested party of good reputation , X is called upon in court to recount what he had seen and heard . He is an " accidental witness , " and his testimony is regularly accepted into evidence in modern systems of jurisprudence ; the assumption is made without argument that the same circumstance stands behind the terminology of witnessing in Heraclitus . I shall argue , on the contrary , that the action evoked by the Heraclitean witness sayings is that of the procedural witness , or oral eyewitness ( i.e. , a person summoned to witness a legal procedure ) , the only form of witnessing for which provision is made in extant archaic Greek law codes . <p> Historians of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1903 ) , 4 corrected early on the mistakes about witnesses found in the nineteenth-century legal commentaries on the most extensive code to survive , the so-called " Great Code " of Gortyn. 5 Philosophical commentators on the witness sayings of Heraclitus have not always followed their example , however . Still under the sway of the Skeptics ' manipulation of Heraclitus ' words , in spirit if no longer in letter , most philosophers have detected issues familiar from later epistemology when the great pioneer entices them by linking such items as " eyes " and " ears , " " bad witnesses " and " barbarous souls . " Heraclitus then becomes the foundation-figure for all those philosophies , including in time religious ones , that impugn mere " sense knowledge , " or castigate the inferior senses in the name of some higher human faculty  --  as he was for Sextus Empiricus , the source for B107. 6 One way or another , for most philosophical commentators " eyes " and " ears " in the witness sayings become a concrete metaphor for sense knowledge generally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ epistemology ( but with no agreement on its details ) , the first in Western philosophy . Behind these interpretations looms the figure , assumed to be Heraclitus ' original , of the accidental witness who is deceived about what his senses have told him , and so later in court is kakos , bad or unreliable , as a witness . The seeds of this line of interpretation were firmly planted by Sextus , who claims Heraclitus for the Skeptical camp because the Ephesian prophet already knew that only " rude " or " crude " ( as he anachronistically understands barbaroi ) souls trust the unreliable senses . <p> In an earlier volume of The Monist 8 edited by Father Joseph Owens I made some passing remarks urging that the witness sayings of Heraclitus should be interpreted on the assumption that a procedural witness was what his Archaic audience would understand " witness " to designate . If correct , some interpretations could then be excluded absolutely ; others would at least be rendered somewhat less probable . A few modern interpretations could stand whichever kind of witnesses is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ futile . For as a matter of sound historical methodology , surely the first exegetical task is to recover as accurately as is now possible what an ancient author 's words communicated to a contemporary audience . Of special relevance would be the many recent interpretations of B107 , the saying which states , enigmatically enough , that eyes and ears are worthless witnesses for humans ( or anthropoi ) if their souls are barbarous . In fifth-century Ionic Greek the adjective barbaros , a linguistic term , refers only to one who is ignorant of the Greek language , a foreigner , and martures would normally refer to procedural witnesses , or oral eyewitnesses , in a society where documentation has made few inroads . In B107 , I suggested therefore that a contemporary scene <p> is being verbally evoked , a sharp memorable picture , as in so many of the sayings , e.g. , " Every beast with blows is pastured ( Bll ) . " Its contours are as follows . An issue is being disputed , probably in the agora , the meeting place of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional procedural witnesses are present ; but the evidence and proceedings are not being properly assessed by these worthies because ... they operate under a crippling deficiency , a linguistic handicap : they can not understand the language of the proceedings , Greek . The scene thus collapses into absurdity ... But the basic situation behind the image is serious enough , one of oral witnessing , a favorite of Heraclitus ( B34 , B107 , B28 , B101a ) and familiar to his contemporaries . B107 , I suggest , has nothing to do with telegraphing or sending messages or the problem of sense knowledge , or the reliability of " sense data " at all ... but to the ancient need for witnessing to what has been orally sworn .... 9 <p> The heart of this suggestion was that Heraclitus , in alluding to acts of witnessing , was evoking the contemporary image of an oral eyewitness to a procedural act . With martures so understood , the Heraclitean witness sayings , like the relevant sections of the famous Gortyn code , can take on very different meanings from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more natural for the century of manufacture . <p> Critics of the earlier article , friendly and hostile , took me to task for assuming that the distinction between accidental and procedural witnesses would be familiar . One friendly commentator , a distinguished Homeric scholar , confessed to his readers that this distinction , and early Greek law codes generally , were terra incognita to him . A further , related objection was that I had not provided much in the way of concrete evidence that Heraclitus , writing in archaic Ephesus , more probably would be evoking the figure of the procedural witness , whose status was well-established in law , than an accidental witness , who had little if any standing in law . The latter point reverses , of course , the legal experience of advanced literate societies , and so would require argument and evidence . I shall try to remedy the informational lacunae here , and in adequate detail . But in partial defense to those fair objections , the earlier article was addressing another topic altogether , in an issue of The Monist devoted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , can be basileus . <p> A preliminary caveat is in order . A detailed defense of new or modified intepretations of the witness sayings of Heraclitus , as warranted by the neglected legal evidence , must await another occasion ; it will not be found here . The scholarly literature on these sayings , some of it now residing in this volume , has grown too vast for adequate treatment in an article that also seeks to discuss amply , and critically , the relevant legal texts . A few suggestions will , however , be offered at the end of the article , and the witness sayings will also be translated . Readers whose recall of these sayings has grown dim may wish to glance at this section before reading the body of the article . Procedural Witnesses in Early Greek Law <p> Although we have fragmentary evidence from the Archaic period for some written laws in some Greek cities starting with Dreros in the middle of the seventh century , only the " Great Code " from Gortyn is a complete document . Only it , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the daily functioning of witnesses in Archaic Greek law courts , but fortunately that evidence is abundant indeed. 10 It is confirmed by incidental references to witnesses and the oral act of witnessing in the literary evidence , such as in the poems of Hesiod and Solon . It seems to reflect an earlier stage of development than our next significant body of evidence for legal witnessing , which is the fourth-century courtroom speeches of the orators . What was to become the " Queen of Inscriptions " for Hellenists began to come to light with a chance discovery by Thenon in 1857 . Almost from the start scholars recognized that the Gortyn find was a legal document , that the period of lettering was Archaic , and that its great columns , as they were recovered in stages , bore the single most important find in the history of Greek law . To date no subsequent find in any part of Hellas has altered that early assessment . As Professor Willetts has written : <p> The Great Code  --  more accurately to be defined as a tabulation of statuary enactments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier oral customs  --  is the first European law code and the only complete code to have survived from ancient Greece . 11 <p> This statement aptly describes the massive document  --  finally to number some 600 lines divided into twelve columns  --  that was found in pieces in the decades following initial discovery . It is not a code in the same sense as would be a highly organized and systematic collection of all the laws of Gortyn , collating them as a complete , written collection , and so codifying " the law . " A complete codification of substantive criminal law together with the more important civil and procedural enactments would be the accomplishment only of a society of advanced literacy , and there is abundant evidence that the Gortynians were not there yet . Even Athens was not to undertake such a legal endeavor , or something approximating it  --  the first Greek city to do so  --  until the great revision and reinscription of law that took place under the supervision of Nichomachus at very end of the fifth century . <p> In his seminal article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early law codes , J. W. Headlam , sought to correct some mistakes and oversights in the earlier German commentary on the Gortyn code published by Zitelmann , an able legal scholar . All relate to what now can best be understood as the unappreciated fact that many oral practices and customs remained in place in Gortyn 's legal life even through literacy , in the form of written law , was making some headway . The code , although a written document , could not be correctly understood apart from also appreciating a residual oral dimension , both in the code 's technical vocabulary and in certain traditional oral institutions that it left in place . Headlam , writing at the turn of this century , could not , of course , be expected to address the issue of the degrees of literacy and orality , and their peculiar Hellenic symbiosis , with the same nomenclature now regularly employed by oralists and historians of literacy . The recovery of the oral dimension in Greek life was pioneered by Milman Parry starting in the 1920 's , and not fully appreciated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps the early 1960 's . Several places in Headlam 's text reveal , however , that he was aware that the interpretation and correction he was offering to the Germall legal historians turned on an understanding by habitual literates of a period in Cretan history when primary orality 12 was in the recent past . Writing was known , but along with a surviving written code as evidence for some uses of writing there were bizarre omissions , for which the code is also irrefutable evidence . The omissions can only be explained as a reflection of a sophisticated society 's lingering preference for oral memories and oral procedures , what elsewhere I have termed the " residual oralism " characteristic of the Archaic period . Headlam did not use precisely this language , nor did he belabor the issue , but at the outset of his article he remarks that in Greece <p> alone of all European races the highest political and literary achievements came at a time when the introduction of writing was so recent that written law had not had time completely to supersede primitive custom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oral usages peculiar to the tribal communities from which they had grown . 13 <p> The failure to appreciate this cultural situation had led some earlier legal commentators astray at more than one place in the code , but nowhere more fatefully than in the many references to witnessing . <p> The first legal commentators had understandably assumed that " witness " meant what in most instances it would in the German and other civilized law codes of the nineteenth century ( and today ) : a person who had been a chance spectator of an event , normally but not always a crime , who might then be summoned to give testimony concerning the facts of which he had been the accidental spectator . Rather , " witnesses " in the code designates  --  without a single exception according to Headlam  --  persons who had been summoned to be present at a procedure as formal , oral eyewitnesses . Their presence was necessary to the legal character of the procedure , part of the total " performative " action ( what Professor Willetts in one place happily terms an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal or valid . The almost ritualized act of eyewitnessing , like the exact pronunciation of oaths of fealty in the Medieval period , had to take place in the prescribed manner , or the action was rendered legally null . In addition , as part of the same function , witnesses were summoned because only their future testimony , should a dispute arise , could serve as official record that an act occurred , or that the court 's order had been duly executed , and the like . Written records , if any were kept ( and none is mentioned in the code ) were inadmissible as evidence as one place in the code involving the role of the mnamon , " The Rememberer , " strongly suggests. 15 A similar distrust of writing , as opposed to confidence in the sworn or remembered word , the witnessed word , is still a characteristic of fourth-century Athenian juries , although the situation was gradually changing in the courts in the early decades of that century . <p> The earlier Gortyn code reveals that procedural eyewitnesses were required in archaic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its only " record " in the event of a future challenge by a litigant or his descendants . We have every reason to believe  --  and none to doubt  --  that this was another of the uniform features ( save in details ) of all Archaic Greek courts , including those of Ionian Ephesus , where the ancient site , covered by sea and centuries of alluvial deposits from the river Cayster , has been far less generous than Gortyn in yielding epigraphical evidence . ( No literary evidence from Ephesus referring to witnesses is older than that from Heraclitus himself , which is reviewed below . ) Such actions as paying a debt , returning a runaway slave , adopting a son , appointing a relative as guardian for an heiress without close male relatives , and a thousand more like them  --  no aspect of life with potential consequences for the future was , it seems , left unwitnessed  --  required that witnesses , in varying numbers depending on the consequences of the event , be summoned . It was far more pervasive in early Hellenic life than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empathy , can now imagine . Perceptively , Headlam observes of the act of witnessing as a procedural act in Archaic Gortyn : <p> The procedure belongs of course chiefly to the period before the introduction of writing . It was soon superseded but not in archaic Greece by written records and written contracts . 16 The Distinction in jure and in judicio in the Gortyn Code <p> What initially caught Headlam 's sharp and informed eye was that all the cases mentioned in the Gortyn inscriptions were tried before a single judge ( dikastes ) , and that all aspects were heard before him only . In addition , two verbs , dikazein and krinein , are systematically used to describe separate aspects of this single magistrate 's duties . When one is used ( dikazei , " he gives judgment " ) , the magistrate is never required to take an oath . When the other is used ( krinei , " he decides " ) , he is always required to do so . Headlam realized that the distinction was too consistently maintained in the code not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal scholar to write an extensive commentary on the code , had also noted the consistent difference in usage between the two verbs , commented on the connection with oath-taking , and then abandoned the matter as intractable . In a discussion devoted to another issue , Zitelmann also stated flatly that there was " no visible trace " in the Gortyn code corresponding to the division in jure and in judicio familiar to legal historians from both Attic and Roman law . 17 Headlam disagreed . Precisely that division is present in Gortyn legal procedure , which he connected with the puzzle about the verbs dikazein and krinein . What had disguised the legal facts from previous historians was a crucial difference between the situations at Gortyn on the one hand , and at Athens ( and Rome ) on the other . At Gortyn both the preliminary hearing ( in Attic law termed anakrisis ; at Rome , the proceeding in jure ) , and the actual trial itself ( in Attic law , termed krisis ; at Rome , the proceeding in judicio ) take place before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Gortynian magistrate undertakes dikazein , " to give judgment . " This he does according to a strict construction of the written law , with no personal discretion permitted . Procedurally this corresponds to the Attic phase of anakrisis , and the Roman procedure injure . In function , the magistrate 's role in this stage approximates that of Athenian archon , or the Roman praetor . As later in Athens , some matters can be settled ( or dismissed ) at this stage , meaning that a suit may never go to what amounts to a trial . ( In what follows , for convenience I will retain the Attic names for these two stages of Gortynian trials . ) <p> If , at Gortyn , the case can not be decided at this stage , either because ( l suggest ) no written law as yet exists that applies to the issue , or for some other reason , the case must then go to the next , or krisis , stage . But the case is not , as later at Athens , handed over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same magistrate , but wearing his other hat and acting in different capacity , " takes the oath and he decides ( homnunta krinein ) " the case on the pleadings . The essential point is that the magistrate can not resolve the case " according to what is written " and " as it is written . " Yet the case requires resolution for the sake of the tranquility of the community . The magistrate is then , so to speak , on his own , but he is not for that reason free to become an arbitrary tyrant . That must be the purpose of the standard oath he takes , to assure that he acts as fairly as he can , sizing up the litigants and their claims governed by his innate sense of fairness . The wording of his oath , alas , is not given , but we may presume it was a " fairness " oath , and so we shall designate it to distinguish it from other types of oaths mentioned in the code . Presumably , then , his basis for decision would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of precedents and previous cases ; perhaps he even cites orally formulated legal rules ( if any ) 18 accepted by all magistrates . Unfortunately the grounds for decision when " he the magistrate decides " are nowhere specified in the code , though they were , of course , well known to the citizens of Gortyn . As Headlam observed , " the important point to notice is that in the first stage anakrisis in Attic terminology the magistrate is bound strictly by the letter of the law. 19 <p> The crucial passage in the Gortyn code describing this procedure is inserted between some regulations concerning the renouncing of the adoption of a son and some provisions for paying a deceased man 's debts . As a result , before Headlam , its importance went unnoticed . Its placement is a reminder that the code , whereas an ordered document to a large extent , records written law that had developed only gradually . Consistent logic in placing individual enactments , even important ones , was not always possible , nor was it achieved . Chronology of formulation may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preceded any other enactment which fell under its rule . That it is a separate enactment is not in question . Asyndeton and spacing gaps are regularly used in the code to set off the separate enactments and provisions , with only occasional doubts about the lawmakers ' intentions . This enactment was plausibly formulated on a different occasion from what precedes or follows it , and is placed here by the stonemason ( or those directing him ) as seeming logically to fit in this general section of the code . Despite its placement , which obscures its central importance , there can be no doubt , as Headlam was the first to appreciate , that the enactment is a most important , independent decree . It is a milestone in the history of the control of written law over human societies . Europe knew nothing like it earlier . It points ahead to the fourth-century Athenian achievement , and to the great Western tradition of the rule of written law . <p> The important enactment , for convenience here termed the " Magistrate 's Instruction , " reads : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgment on ; the judge shall give judgment ( dikazei ) as it is written , according to witnesses procedural or oaths of , e.g. , denial ; but in other matters he shall himself take an oath of fairness and decide ( homnunta krinet ) according to the pleas. 20 <p> Behind the need at last to formulate this rule so precisely we may perhaps detect some tension in the community over what was to be governed by developing written law , and what could be left to ancient , oral custom . Neither homicide nor impiety is provided for in the written code , for example , and there are other puzzling omissions . One explanation , a controversial one , is that what ought to be done in those areas was so well known and established that the need to write it down was not immediately felt . On the other hand , procedural matters , always susceptible to alterations , would figure prominently in early written regulations , as would any departures or modifications from custom law. 21 <p> The magistrate at Gortyn first , in what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law in such matters as are written , being bound strictly by the wording of the law and by the testimony of witnesses ( in the oralist sense , procedural witnesses ) , and by oaths ( also in the oralist sense , mainly of denial ) . The magistrate himself takes no oath since the resolution is viewed as automatic , or mechanical . But if matters between the litigants can not be resolved in this phase for whatever reason , the magistrate himself then must take the oath ( of fairness ) , and he decides the case as best he can . As noted , we do not know on what basis . Whether in the krisis stage he considered or invited the testimony of what amounted to accidental " witnesses " ( but perhaps this early called by some other name ) is therefore also unknown . The important point , if Headlam is correct , is that in all cases mentioned in the code , covering every spectrum of social life , there are no examples of accidental witnesses . Without exception , <p> mualpha iotagamma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The form or act they have to prove is sometimes proceedings in court , sometimes those parts of a process which are essential but take place out of court , sometimes contracts or agreements . In all cases , the witnesses are official , they must have been summoned beforehand for the purposes of witnessing the act ; it does not include the evidence of accidental spectators . 22 The Range of Procedural Witnessing in Early Greece <p> The Great Code , disappointingly for some , does not commence with a ringing statement of general principles , or even a weighty matter of substantive or criminal law . Instead , as is true in several Near Eastern law codes , including the Hebrew , the code begins with enactments regulating largely procedural matters concerning the treatment of servile persons such as slaves ( actual or alleged ) . 23 Enactments are formulated as casuistic law , which is normal for the code , protasis stating the delict or action as hypothetical facts ( if a man does ... ) , and the apodosis stating the consequence or provision ( then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some seeming exceptions  --  and perhaps only in that way  --  we can gain an appreciation for the dominanting presence of the procedural witness in Archaic Greek life . <p> Some early enactments govern the seizing of an escaped slave  --  or a free man , if his status is disputed . Behind one enactment is the following circumstance . A certain man , A , had in his possession a slave whom the court has determined belongs to another man , B , and A was ordered to restore him to B. But before this can happen the slave runs away , taking sanctuary in a temple ( seemingly not uncommon ) , creating a serious dilemma for A. He can not now obey the court and restore the slave to B. The bracketed words are intended to fill out the text for the modern reader . <p> But if a slave , with regard to whom a man has been defeated in a trial takes sanctuary , let him the defeated party show him at the temple , summoning two witnesses , runners i.e. , adults , having access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point him the slave out where he has taken sanctuary , himself or another for him ; but if he either does not summon or does not point out , let him pay what has been written. 24 <p> That is , A can resolve his dilemma without penalty only by following certain strict procedures . He must , with two witnesses , summon B to the temple where the slave has taken refuge , and he must show the slave to B in the presence of the witnesses . Should A fail either in the summoning or in the showing , and thus be unable to produce his two witnesses in court to prove that he performed both actions as prescribed , A must pay the specified penalty . The magistrate in this stage of the case must " judge according to the witnesses and the oaths " and may not exercise any personal discretion , or consider whether B exercised due caution in preventing the escape , or the like . <p> A second example from the code involves a man accused of adultery . The law assumes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seized in the very house of the husband of the women ( or of her father or brother ) . Obvious danger to the social peace lurks here . If the adulterer is killed directly the vengeance of the adulterer 's relatives may escalate into a vendetta between families , a problem to this day in Mediterranean countries , and elsewhere . The law seeks to do what it can to prevent this from happening. 25 <p> Let him the husband , father , or brother proclaim before three witnesses to the relatives of him who has been seized , that they may ransom him within five days ; in the case of a slave , to his master before two witnesses . If he is not ransomed , he shall belong to the captors to do with him what they will. 26 <p> The law requires that the captor follow a series of formal procedures involving an oral proclamation ( we note again that no documents surface ) that , to be valid , must be before witnesses . If after five days no ransom is paid and the captor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the witnesses would protect him from any further legal action , and from the revenge of the adulterer 's relations  --  or at least from their lawful revenge . <p> These are weighty matters likely to bring great disturbance to the community and so require established procedures of resolution . Simpler matters also required procedural witnesses , although fewer of them . A has borrowed , let us say , ten starers from B , the amount and the conditions being duly witnessed . If a witness is later produced before a magistrate testifying that the debt was owed and was to be paid before a certain date , and no counterclaims are introduced , then judgment for the claimant is given according to testimony of the witnesses . The judge has no discretion , but must " give judgment ( dikazei ) " as is written . The case is a simple one , unless of course B produces his witness testifying that , in fact , he paid A. According to the Magistrate 's Instruction , which is observed without exception in the code , the magistrate judges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is reached . This would occur if two sets of witnesses can not both be correct ; chronology will not settle the matter , and so someone is mistaken or , more likely , lying ( and so probably " bought " ) . Then the judge can only take the oath and decide as best he can . Isocrates has a client claim ( Trapeziticus 54 ) " for you jurymen of Athens think it is possible to suborn witnesses even for actions that never occurred . " Gortyn was hardly immune from the " bought witness . " <p> Gortynian procedure becomes especially clear in one case where the ownership of a slave is being contested . The judge is instructed to take the fairness oath and decide either if no witness testifies , or if both parties produce witnesses and the testimony is at odds . This provision is necessary , I suggest , because sometimes the ownership of a slave would be the result of a witnessed act , as in a sale . In other cases , such as when a slave was born into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took place , at least none that would be admitted as evidence in a Gortynian court . If only one claimant to a slave 's ownership can produce a procedural witness , he wins automatically , and the judge need not take the fairness oath . If none testifies , or if both litigants produce rival procedural witnesses whose testimony can not be reconciled , an impasse is reached , and so the judge takes the oath and " be decides . " The terse wording is thus ( barely ) sufficient : <p> the judge is to give judgment according to the witnesses , if a witness testify , but he is to decide on oath if they testify for both or for neither. 27 <p> In none of these cases , as close reading reveals , is the witness an accidental witness . All were summoned beforehand to witness some transaction , and then summoned later to testify to the previous action . <p> In the above case , for example , no provision is made for the testimony of an accidental witness , X ( or " witness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the contested slave had been seen at work over many years in the household of A , one of the litigants , when good citizen X often visited A , or the like . Did early Greek law courts make no provision for such obviously valuable testimony ? I find it hard to believe they did not , a point that can not be argued here , but how , and under what " rules of evidence " before such rules were known , is difficult to say . We simply do not know , and written law at Gortyn nowhere addresses the issue . On the other hand , the use of procedural witnesses will have had a long , regularized history in any complex oral society . This testimony must be admitted , and be accepted on the face unless countered by another procedural witness , or the society in the absence of written documentation can not function . Written law at Gortyn provides for what had from time out of mind been a part of the community 's oral life ; its provisions are simply a recognition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law , and much more deeply established . The acceptance of the testimony of the accidental witness is , perhaps , more problematical at this stage in the development of law , less regularized , less formalized and ritualized , and so regarded as inherently less certain , at least to that society . Our best evidence by far , the Gortyn code , provides no unambiguous example of the testimony of the accidental witness , and so no example of " witness " used to designate such a person . Examples of procedural witnesses are almost endless . <p> From these examples it is clear that the society as yet knows no other form of record for the sorts of transactions discussed , even though alphabetic writing was available to it , and had been since at least the middle of the seventh century. 28 Behind the extensive and exclusive use of procedural witnessing found in the code , and found presumably throughout Archaic Greece ( for this we must rely mainly on literary evidence , or late written law ) , lies not a deficiency in technology but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of local courts . As noted by Oliver Wendell Holmes in the famous opening remarks of his great work The Common Law ( 1881 ) , what has determined the course of the history of the law is less reason and logic than accumulating human experience , " what works " for our species in a place and time and so has solidified into custom and habit deemed natural . The law , whether written law or oral custom law , has everywhere been inherently conservative , for good reason . <p> Much space in the Gortyn code is devoted to what American lawyers know as family law , and as a result this area of legislation affords abundant example of procedural witnessing . Many of these provisions concern women and their property . The argument has been plausibly made that at least some of the ancestral rights of women under Dorian tribal custom law are being revised and curtailed in the written code , whose framers were aristocratic males . If so , then this would explain why these matters are addressed in writing in unusual detail. 29 <p> Column @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contingencies . Five groups of heirs , and their order of succession , are specified . If a man or woman dies , and there are children , or grandchildren , or great grandchildren , they shall have the property . If there are none of these , the code orders the possible heirs through brothers ( and their children ) and then sisters ( and their children ) , and so on . The code also distinguishes between real estate or immovable property , and movable property such as livestock , clothing , or personal items . It considers that , perhaps , heirs may not agree on dividing such movable property . If so , the law directs that it be sold for the highest price possible , and the proceeds divided . The considerable detail found here is a reminder , if any were needed , that no form of social life , especially one involving many thousands of people , is really simple , and that sophisticated oral means existed long before written law to manage them . <p> When inherited property is divided , the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these are , of course , procedural witnesses . Their presence legalizes the division , so to speak ; but they are also its only record should a later dispute arise . If , in a later trial , it emerges that B has seized what was given to A , and the witnesses testify in the anakrisis stage that such and such was , indeed , given to A in the division , the magistrate decides exclusively on what is written ( the law governing division ) , and the testimony of the eyewitnesses . He may not exercise discretion in the matter , even if he felt the original division was grossly unfair , or rigged somehow . The items must be restored to A , which , again , would be witnessed . The judge need not take the fairness oath , for he exercised no discretion in the matter . It was narrowly decided based on written law and the testimony of the procedural witnesses . <p> The absence of the use of witnesses is notable in one place , and it is an exception that goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerns the ransoming , presumably by a kinsman ( some sort of necessity for action is suggested in a difficult text ) of a Gortyn prisoner held in a foreign city . If this has occurred , but the freed man and his ransomer fail to agree on ( a ) whether the man asked to be ransomed or ( b ) what in compensation the liberated man owes to the one who freed him , or ( c ) on how long a period of servitude would be equal to what is owed , then the magistrate takes the fairness oath and summarily decides on the pleadings . No provision is made for the anakrisis stage , and securing the testimony of witnesses . Willetts translates the difficult section , a complete enactment ( the text breaks after the start of the next enactment ) , as follows : <p> If anyone bound by necessity should get a man gone away to a strange place free from a foreign city at his own request , he shall be in the power of the one who ransomed him until he pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the amount or on the ground that he did not request to be set free , the judge is to decide on oath with reference to the pleas. 30 <p> This enactment has puzzled commentators because seemingly it is a glaring exception to the use of procedural witnesses to settle such disputes . The anakrisis stage is bypassed altogether , and the magistrate proceeds directly to the krisis stage in which he decides on the representations of the litigants . I suggest that , uniquely here for such procedures , there had been no anakrisis stage because there could not be . There was no formally witnessed testimony to hear . The events took place away from Gortyn , at a " strange place " and in a " foreign city " as the code specifies , where no free , adult , male Gortynians ( or Gortynians of any gender or status ) were available to serve in the capacity of procedural witnesses to a contract or agreement , as in law only they could do . The magistrate must therefore , in this special case , bypass the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is , take the fairness oath and decide immediately as best he can , according to the litigants ' pleas . <p> Another seeming exception that , upon examination , again turns out to be no exception at all concerns witnessing an adoption . Adoptions are especially tricky in Greek law because only in this way could a man make as his heir someone not in a predetermined line of familial inheritance . It has sometimes been claimed that certain adoptions are not witnessed at Gortyn , and so are an exception to the evidence so convincingly mustered by Headlam , but this fails to appreciate a well-known oral procedure . On the contrary , so important was the act of adoption , especially when a propertied man with legitimate heirs adopts a son not related by blood to him , or else adopts his bastard , that the whole community become the witnesses ; that is , the adoption must be orally and formally made a matter of public knowledge . This procedure has close parallels in Germanic and other law codes . The procedure is also revealing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as effecting the legal act . At Gortyn , as always , no mention is made of written records . Instead , <p> the declaration of adoption shall be made from the speaking-place of assembly ( agora ) when the citizens are gathered , from the stone from which proclamations are made. 31 <p> Should the man who adopted another wish to reverse the process he must reenact the same procedure . This is specified in the next column . <p> And if the adopting party wishes , he may renounce the previous adoption in the speaking place of assembly ( agora ) , when the citizens are gathered , from the stone from which proclamations are made. 32 <p> Two conditions are tacked on to this enactment ( Col. XI 14-19 ) , and then a separate , related enactment is added ( 19-23 ) . Whereas terse , and to us not entirely clear , each deserves brief notice . First , ten starers shall be deposited with the Rememberer of the magistrate " who sees to matters involving strangers , " to be given to the renounced party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existed at Gortyn , corresponding to the Athenian Polemarch . Strangers were especially vulnerable under custom law , when self-help often required that family members be available for revenge , or its threat . Second , a woman may not adopt , nor a male before puberty ; there is no explanation or elaboration . Under some circumstances could a woman adopt earlier , under custom law ? Next it is specified  --  this in a separate enactment , set off by two vacats  --  that written law shall be followed in the matters of these regulations from the time of inscription , but property held as a result of a different , earlier arrangement shall be held without liability . Written law is , in some regards , presumably modifying older custom law , but the social dislocation of applying written law post facto to ownership of real property is recognized . <p> It is instructive to note who are permitted to be witnesses at Gortyn , and so ( by default ) who are not , for the division of property . The code requires : <p> When they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , freemen , three or more. 33 <p> Similar terminology is found elsewhere in the code . The term " runner " ( dromeus ) was given to an adult citizen , indicating that he had a right of access to the public gymnasia . Excluded from being witnesses when dividing property thus would be ( a ) all women , ( b ) minors , and ( c ) male adults from classes that do not enjoy full citizenship , and therefore ( d ) all foreigners . Those covered by ( c ) would be the apetairoi , who were free persons but lacking the political and civil rights of aristocratic citizens ; also serfs and slaves , and , probably , free men who are temporarily indentured to another for unpaid debts . Whether under ( c ) would be included bastard sons who remained part of a father 's household , nothoi , is uncertain , since the code , otherwise so detailed in its concern with family law and inheritance , nowhere mentions them . <p> As even a casual reader of the Gortyn code becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in early Greek life . At this point in the development of Cretan literacy  --  and as far as we know anywhere in Greece  --  only the oral testimony of an eyewitness , not a document , would be accepted as evidence in a court . This was changing only gradually in Athens in the fourth century , but suspicion of the unsupported document remained strong . By chance , the Gortyn code indirectly informs us that no documents ( if any were made ) of a magistrate 's mnamon , his rememberer or recorder , were accepted into evidence , for he like any other procedural witness must testify in person to a past event . At Gortyn this remained true even if a previous decision were crucial for the resolution of a case , and the mnamon had died , or were away from the city . Apparently the suit simply fell , or the magistrate took the fairness oath and decided on another basis. 34 This , remarkably , was still the case when the written law itself  --  and rather elegantly inscribed at that  --  is evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believe , as noted above , this can be explained only by the tenacity of oral habit , and the somewhat reluctant , or at least gradual , adoption of the rival technology of alphabetic notation and record . The role of oral witnessing , so dominant a feature of the code , is , I conclude , a feature of primary orality that has carried over into a period of restricted literacy . It serves all the functions that , in time , would be served primarily by literate documentation . At every turn disputes must be decided by the magistrates " according to the witnesses , " where maitures is properly regarded as a technical term for procedural eyewitnesses. 35 <p> The legal formula in the code , as Headlam argued so many years ago , that demanded correct understanding was the one requiring a magistrate in the anakrisis phase ( again following the later Attic terminology ) of a trial to rule " according to witnesses and oaths ( kata maiturans he apomoton ) . " This paper has been concerned mainly with the kind of witness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in its way as alien to literates as the exclusive reliance on the procedural witnesses , will be treated elsewhere . As also noted above , what had led to the failure of early commentators to appreciate the distinction between the anakrisis and krisis phases of the trial was precisely their failure to understand " witness " in what I here call the " oralist " sense , or the procedural sense , and instead to understand it in what Headlam himself called the later or " modern " sense of the accidental witness . For if " witnesses " had the later meaning of accidental observers of some disputed fact , and the judge dikei kata maiturans , then there could be no anakrisis phase at all . The real trial proceeded straightaway with the judge taking testimony from accidental witnesses concerning what had occurred , the reputed facts , as they by chance had observed them . The sharp and consistent distinction between dikazein and krinein in the code 's wording would again become unintelligible . Instead , insisted Headlam , at this stage in the development of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any fact ; they are formal witnesses ; they are formal witnesses to the proper performance of procedural acts . Before a man can bring a case into court he has to go through certain formalities , these must be performed before witnesses , the presence of the witness is necessary to the validity of the acts , and their statement is the proof required by law that the acts have been performed. 36 No Accidental Witnesses at Gortyn ? Two Difficult Enactments <p> Until very recently 37 no scholar known to me seriously challenged Headlam 's main conclusions . One text especially has provoked a good deal of comment , and Headlam himself noted it . The law , a separate enactment , is ( for us ) maddeningly terse , and the wording ambiguous : <p> If he attempts to seduce a free woman who is in the charge of a relation ( a kadestes ) he shall pay ten staters , if a witness testifies. 38 <p> At first reading , students of law might naturally assume  --  and some commentators have assumed  --  that the witness in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or attempted seduction ( the latter translation of the verb has been defended as more probable ) took place , a lurking servant or the like . Upon reflection , however , that becomes an awkward understanding of a difficult text . The perpetrator is a free male . Would the accidental witness against him not have to be a free , adult male ? If not , could just anyone testify  --  slaves , or other servile persons , or women ? How can the law be silent on this issue when normally it is so specific on the qualifications of witnesses ? Further , is it likely that such an outrageous act would be attempted in front of any other person , let alone one who could testify to the offense in a court . And are we to imagine , from the enactment 's wording and assuming an accidental witness is meant , that if intercourse is attempted but no witnesses happen to be present , then no prosecution could take place ? Is this what the conditional clause , " if a witness testifies , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the code , means in this case ? <p> These are not the only problems that arise if an accidental witness is assumed to be intended here ; there is a weightier one . The kadestes enactment is part of a series of closely related statutes . All are sexual delicts , some far more serious than the one in question . Column 11 of the code , after a few words that have run over from Column I ( the mason ran out of space ) , commences with a mighty register of sexual offenses , and their penalities ( lines 2-45 ) , organized under four kinds . These are : rape , commencing with fines for the rape of free persons , female or male , by males who are free or not , with fines apportioned according to the social status of perpetrator and victim ( lines 2-10 ) ; forcible seduction of a female slave ( lines 11-16 : it has been argued that the law did not concern itself with the fate of male slaves in this regard ) ; attempted seduction of a free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in question ; and then fourth , in by far the longest section , adultery in its many manifestations and social consequences ( lines 20-45 ) . In this detailed body of written law , addressing actions that the community 's peaceful survival can not lightly ignore , the need for a witness arises in one instance only , that of the attempted seduction of a free woman in the short kadestes enactment ( 16-20 ) . If the happy chance of an accidental witness to the offense is intended by the peculiar wording , why is this ? More serious offenses by far have been catalogued , and no witness to them is required , or so much as mentioned . <p> Headlam argued , following sound historical methodology , that this case , because so exceptional in the code if an accidental witness is meant , should be interpreted in conformity with all the others about which no doubt existed , unless that is impossible . Only then should an exception be claimed , and " witness " be understood as ( somehow ) an accidental witness in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details , and interpreted others , but essentially follow Headlam , with some help from Gernet and Willetts . <p> The need for a witness arises uniquely in this case among a series of sexual delicts because the woman 's relation , in whose charge she is , is not a father or a brother , but a karlestes . In this context the term clearly designates a more distant relative , a kinsman who will function as her kyrios ( in the Attic terminology , " lord " ) , or guardian . He was selected , often from a large number of possible candidates in the clan , because the woman 's close male relatives predeceased her . At Athens and elsewhere in Greece , there never was a time when a woman was not under the control of either her husband or a male relative serving as her guardian . This was of special concern when her inherited property was involved , and a future marriage . It is one of those many instances where Greek custom , followed by written law , remained mostly uniform in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transfer of the charge of the woman , an epikleros , or heiress , and her property had not been automatic , as it would have been if she had a father or brothers who were living . Were any or all of them alive , then to whom her control and protection passed would have been automatic , a matter long fixed in custom law . No deliberation about it would have occurred , and the whole community would have known the outcome in advance , and ever after that ; no procedural witnesses would have been required to effect the transfer , or record it . But when a kinsman had to be selected from a large number of possibilities this was not so , and witnesses had to be summoned both to formalize the transfer of control of her property and her person to this kadestes , and to serve as later record of it . <p> The relative who was given the control of the woman is now due damages because of the offense to her clan . This arrangement , in which not the injured women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family or clan , which is viewed as suffering the offense  --  receives the damages is common enough in early law codes , including the Hebrew ( Exod. 21:21-22 , where a woman 's family receives damages for her miscarriage ) . <p> We also should note , as is standard in casuistic legal formulation , that the law can not address the issue of whether the proscribed action took place ; the situation is stated hypothetically . Protasis states the offense , " if a man does ... , " and apodosis the penalty now affixed by law . Casuistic law can not , therefore , address the issue of whether an individual is guilty of the proscribed action . It can , as here , address the issue of the amount to be paid to the male guardian in staters ( ten ) if the action has occurred , and specify how his claim to be the woman 's rightful kadestes is to be established . A procedural witness must testify that he had been present at the formal transfer , had heard what was said , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a witness testifies . " The law thus provides that at least one procedural witness to the woman 's transfer ( which could have occurred many years before , for the woman may have been orphaned at an early age ) must have survived and be present in court to testify . Payment in money , since coinage was recent on Crete , can not have reached very far back in custom law ; therefore written law also addresses the amount , probably fixing it for the first time . The amount appears elsewhere in the code , and seems to represent a severe slap on the wrist . That compensation in some form must be given in such cases is immemorially old , and widespread in the Near Eastern law codes . Prior to written law , we may guess , compensation might be rufused , in which case self-help would be the result , some form of vengeance , with the attendant dangers of a blood feud between families . <p> The terse wording , and the total circumstance , now become perfectly intelligible , as no doubt they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at intercourse with a free woman by a free man has taken place , then the transgressor shall pay ten staters , " if a witness testifies . " The witness testifies not to the act of attempted intercourse , an issue more likely resolved by oaths ( where a woman 's solemn oath , even if she is a serf , had formidable status in law ) , but to the fact that this woman had been given in this relationship to this kadestes . The fine is somewhat light , which is noteworthy ; the reason is that the kyrios is not a father or brother , but a more distant relation . Otherwise the fine would have been far heavier. 39 <p> Michael Gagarin , in a short article that promises further publication on the subject , has cited a second case that , he suggests , may have been unknown to Headlam . Gagarin 's line of argument deserves close attention , although its full analysis is beyond the scope of the present paper . His position is that , except for the kadestes case above , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( that number is many , but Gagarin clearly intends to leave open reappraisal of Gortyn texts not explicitly discussed by Headlam ) . Further , in the kadestes case , Headlam may be right , but Headlam 's is not the only interpretation that the terse wording  --  taken in isolation from the rest of the code  --  permits . That is true , of course , as any attempt to interpret this enactment were it a solitary text would quickly reveal . The power of Headlam 's position was that it made good sense of this enactment by bringing it into conformity with what was found uniformly throughout the code . Gagarin grants this . But if a case were to be found in which the witness mentioned must be an accidental witness and can not be a procedural one , then the kadestes enactment is open for reconsideration , leaving an even wider opening to reconsider any other ambiguous wordings in the code . <p> Professor Gagarin 's revisionist opening in future publications will be , I suspect , created in no small measure because the phrasing ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is formulaic throughout the code , often not telling us specifically to what the witness will testify . Gagarin proposed that the wording in I. Cret . IV 41.5.4-11 , a text perhaps unknown to Headlam , as parts of the so-called " Second Code " may well have been , can refer only to an accidental witness . The enactment seeks to deal with a complex situation . If a man works a field that belongs to another man , or carries off another 's property , when he is under the temporary control of another ( i.e. , as an indentured person working off a debt that he was unable to pay ) , he is immune from claims or damages . But that claim to immunity can be compromised , giving rise to a legal dispute . The enactment , terse in the extreme , has two parts , which I divide below . <p> If at the command of or , in the power of ? another he works a field or carries off property , he is immune from all . But if he the master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command , the judge is to take the oath and decide , if no witness testifies . <p> Gagarin claims that the testimony of this witness could not be " anything other than testimony to the fact that the master either did or did not give the wrongdoer an order to act as he did . And this is clearly testimony to a fact , and moreover , a fact learned by chance . " 40 I am less sure , but possibly Gagarin is right , as often on these matters he is . In the code the wording assumes that much is understood by the readers , mainly Gortynian magistrates , and so is not being supplied in the text . This feature of the Gortyn code has led to many previous disputes among legal experts . Importantly for the present discussion , the verb apoponioi , " testifies , " is left ( for us ) suspended , begging for a conclusion to the phrase . A witness if available testifies , that is certain enough , but to what ? And what witness ? The verb dangles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncertain , at least to us . Obviously the Gortynians knew the answers and needed no further instruction . We do . <p> Let us suppose for a moment that a chance witness is meant , as Professor Gagarin believes . Surely , that the master did not give the command is not an issue that can be settled by an accidental witness , or a choir of them . For the man who commanded the other man 's labor , the master , as Gagarin usefully calls him , is not going to introduce a witness ( the word is single here ) to testify that , having never been absent when master and servant were together , he can verify that at no moment of the night or day was such a command given . No number of accidental witnesses could prove that , and no court would entertain the testimony . The master , in a word , can not prove a negative . So , if the enactment does not entertain the possibility that an accidental witness will testify for the master to the effect that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testifying that he had , indeed , heard the command being given by the master . He would thus be appearing in support of the indentured servant , not the master  --  if he is an accidental witness . <p> This , too , while at least conceivable , has difficulties . Let us be clear about what they are . It means in this case  --  by assuming the witness is an accidental witness  --  the law is providing for a situation in which a master claims not to have given an order to do X , and his impoverished indentured servant who admits to doing X , claims he did it under the control of another . The servant , by simply producing one witness  --  apparently anyone will do  --  to testify with him , and claim by chance to have overheard the order given , quits himself of the charge and wins his case . The verdict is automatic , a " directed finding . " The magistrate need not take the fairness oath and decide on the basis of pleas , but judges according to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The intent of the enactment , on this construction , is to protect indentured servants , powerless katakeimenoi , from corrupt , aristocratic masters . And that , it seems to me , whereas not impossible , is unlikely . <p> We may , perhaps , doubt that such an enactment , preserving a servant from trial if but one ( accidental ) witness  --  the code here does not specify social class , and the singular is used  --  comes forth to support him , would be sponsored or permitted by the aristocratic kosmoi of Gortyn ? For it should be stressed that if Professor Gagarin is correct , the actual " trial " takes place in the anakrisis phase . More precisely , there is no trial at all . Summary judgment , a finding directed by written law , is given for the servant as soon as any witness speaks up for him . On this reading , by the force of the negative wording , the magistrate takes the oath and decides , and so would move to the krisis stage , only " if no accidental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established legal procedure at Gortyn strongly argues against an accidental witness being intended here . <p> Adding to these difficulties , which are formidable enough , if an accidental witness is meant he would be testifying that by chance he overheard an order , one that an indentured servant is forced to obey , being given to go out and steal , or to work another 's land . Would such an order , forcing a controlled person to perform actions forbidden in written law , be blatantly given in the presence of witnesses ? Also , the formulaic wording , uniform throughout the code , for a judge 's taking the fairness oath before deciding on the pleas , and for the testimony of a procedural witness , is reproduced exactly in the Greek text . Would not that linguistic fact alone suggests a more Headlamic interpretation , if one is possible ? Perhaps one is . <p> Could the issue at point , about which a witness might testify and so preclude the need for trial , be the procedural one of whether , at the reported time of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions of his indenture ? If he were , he would be required to do anything commanded of him , and the master , not he , would be liable for damages . The law itself tells us as much . That is , the wording in the first part of the enactment clearly assumes the servant would have so acted if commanded by his ( temporary ) master , and states that he is immune from all damages : " If when at the direction of another he works a field or carries off property , he is immune .... " One way to understand the entire enactment , I propose , is to take the injunction about a witness testifying with the second part of the enactment , where the lawmakers put it . Thus the law says that the automatic immunity of indentured servitude , or the presumption of it , which is normal , as recognized in the first clause , can be brought into question . This happens if the man to whom the servant has been indentured denies control ; then , if " no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleas . The issue about which a witness testifies , if one is available , would be the conditions of the contract of indenture itself , for which he had been a procedural witness at the time of the agreement . <p> If this is correct , then one man , the servant , is claiming that the contract of indenture was still in effect and that he did only as he was told ; the law protects him from damages arising from his actions . The other man , the master , is claiming that the servant no longer acted at his command , i.e. , that the period of indenture had expired , or whatever . No written records , we recall , are accepted to settle these matters anywhere in the code , only procedural witnesses . If no procedural witness can be produced to settle whether the period of indenture covered the period the crime was committed ( liability , not that the servant committed the crime , is the legal issue ) , then an impasse is reached , and the judge must take the fairness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still prevail . <p> A witness , we know , would be called when a debt was repaid , but also when an arrangement was made for the debt to be satisfied by an agreed upon time of indentured servitude in place of payment . Moreover , as we also know , a witness can meet with an accident , or be out of the city , or have a falling out with one of the parties , or be afraid to testify , or be bought off , and so on . The enactment thus may intend to specify , elliptically enough ( but this is common in the code 's wording ) , that if no witness ( note the rarer negative formulation ) will testify that the man was , indeed , indentured to this master , or that on the day of the crime the period of indenture had ( or had not ) expired according to the original terms of the agreement , then the judge takes the oath and decides on basis of the two parties ' respective pleas alone . <p> I think we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , the person whose land was illegally worked or whose movable property , such as tools , was removed , deserves damages ; the issue , in a case involving an indentured servant as opposed to a slave , is who shall pay the damages . Who was legally liable at the moment of the tort ? Presumably a free man temporarily indentured was not liable for damages arising from work-related actions committed while he was indentured ; the master had the legal liability , as in the case of a slave . The law assumes Gortynians fully understood this . The law , thus , does not seek , as it initially appears to us to do , to free an indentured servant from legal responsibility for his work-related acts when commanded to do them , providing only " a witness testifies . " On the contrary , it seeks to free the master from paying damages for the servant 's actions if he denies , and can prove by a procedural witness , that the man was no longer under his control . For then , as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . If so , then the ambiguous phrasing " the master testifies that it was not at his command " equates with , and appears to be formulaic terminology for , " claims that he was not under his control , not in his power . " ( See the related wording of VI . 48 , with the comments of Willetts ad loc . ) Thus , if no procedural witness can be produced to prove the term of servitude either way , that is , " if no witness testifies " ( as this enactment negatively reads ) , the magistrate has no recourse but to take the fairness oath and decide between the two representations as best he can . <p> This solution , I grant , is not altogether satisfactory , and somewhat forces the language of the enactment into addressing a less than obvious issue , but then that is not uncommon for Gortyn . On the other hand , the argument that an accidental witness is intended is not free of difficulties either . If a more Headlamic interpretation , such as the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then we are back to the methodological question . Should two difficult cases , the kadestes case and the indentured servant case  --  both so terse in wording , leaving so much to be supplied by legally informed Gortynians  --  be interpreted in congruence with all the other cases in the code , or not ? Further offerings from Professor Gagarin may provide a more satisfactory resolution than any on the horizon , at least any known to me . <p> We now are in a position to turn to the witness sayings of Heraclitus . For by understanding first some of the peculiar workings of early Greek law , and how they differ from modern law , we are in a better position to understand and appreciate what the Ephesian philosopher says about witnessing . Witnessing in Heraclitus : Evoking the Image of the Procedural Witness <p> Before Headlam  --  and sometimes incautiously after him  --  the many references to witnessing in the Gortyn code , and in early Greek law generally , were assimilated to the familiar phenomenon of the modern accidental witness . When this occurred the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disaster of the first order . Could the same be true for Heraclitus , who refers in his sayings to witnessing and witnesses , evoking images drawn from the local courts of archaic Greece in their technical language ? <p> My first observation is that , if possible , we ought to interpret his words in congruence with what we know about the contemporary linguistic and cultural facts , and can irrefutably document  --  not , I think , a controversial proposal . That means that a reference to " witness " in Heraclitus , more probably than not , was intended to evoke in the minds of an archaic audience the situation of procedural witnessing so familiar to them , the formal act of oral eyewitnessing . For a procedural witness  --  whatever occasional status may have been given to an accidental witness  --  is what the word " witness " conveyed in archaic Greek , especially in any setting that evokes the courts or the law . Interpretation of the Heraclitean witness sayings should , therefore , at least begin there , to see if an interpretation based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elsewhere in the collection . <p> B107 reads : <p> Worthless witnesses ( martures ) to men are eyes and ears If they have barbarous souls . <p> Elsewhere 41 I have argued that the scene being evoked is that of the procedural witness who must be physically present , see with his own eyes , and hear with his own ears , what is said , in order to validate the proceeding and later to function as its record . As in so many extant sayings , anthropoi , most Hellenes , are being held up to ridicule and satire . They are satirically portrayed as hearing ( the logos of Heraclitus ? ) but failing to comprehend ; they are ridiculous procedural witnesses who can not understand the language of the proceeding for which they have been summoned as the witnesses . They are , indeed , kakoi , worthless , unreliable , dysfunctional . The only meaning for the adjective barbaros that Archaic Ionic dialect knows is to designate a person who is ignorant of the Greek language , a foreigner . It is not as yet pejorative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack ( and satire ) is thus not an attack on sense experience , of which philosophy is as yet innocent , but on the capacity of procedural eyewitnesses , to whom anthropoi are being compared , to comprehend proceedings conducted in Greek if they are barbaroi , ignorant of Greek 42 <p> Placing anthropos in such absurd situations , as Hussey and others have rightly stressed , is a common feature of the sayings . Were not so much of later philosophy consumed with epistemological issues the saying might have been more readily seen to belong with the many others in the collection that use contemporary scenes ( and popular sayings ) to hold stupid anthropoi up to Heraclitean scorn and ridicule . Edward Hussey 's list , to which I would add BI07 , is far from exhaustive : <p> They are compared to sleepers in private worlds of their own ( , frs . 1 , 2 , 73 ) ; to children who believe what their parents tell them ( fr. 74 ; cf. 79 ) ; to dogs who bark at strangers ( fr. 97 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( fr. 34 ) ; to idiots who take fright at any sensible utterance ( fr. 87 ) . Their opinions are toys with which they childishly amuse themselves ( fr. 70 ) . 43 <p> They are also compared to linguistically impaired procedural eyewitnesses who can not understand the language of the proceedings to which they have been summoned as witness and record . <p> B107 " resonates " ( Kahn 's designation ) in word and image to another witness saying in the collection , B34 : <p> Not comprehending even after they have heard the logos ? they anthropoi are like unto the deaf to then witnesses ( marturei ) the saying present , they are absent . <p> The saying itself witnesses , attests ( i.e. , stands as attester ) to the truth or the facts of the prior situation : most Hellenes are " noncomprehending . " They are like deaf persons who are present ( at an oral proceeding , for words are spoken ) , yet in a significant sense are not present , for they can not comprehend what is being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a procedural witness , can testify that anthropoi heard ( note the past tense ; " having heard " ) , but they did not comprehend . <p> The verb marturei evokes the image of testifying procedural witnesses , but who are deaf , and so uncomprehending . They are being compared to the philosopher 's favorite target , anthropoi , who after they have heard the logos ( or Heraclitus ) , remain unaffected , as uncomprehending as before . The note of dissatisfaction , and polemic , as elsewhere in the sayings , is strong . Seemingly , at a minimum , the Ephesian prophet laments that he and his logos are without honor in his own city . Whatever we may conclude may be the historical reasons driving this polemic against anthropoi in Heraclitus ' sayings , it emerges as the dominant feature found in the extant collection , deserving greater attention from Heraclitean scholars . <p> B28 may , in fact , be an amalgam of two sayings brought together by Saint Clement , the source , and some editors print them as such . Whatever the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half ( or 28b DK ) would be clear enough to an Archaic audience . <p> Dike ( Justice ) will convict the fabricator of falsehoods , and his witnesses ( martufas ) ! <p> However the saying is to be philosophically interpreted , or connected with what precedes it ( if they are connected ) , the scene being evoked in the quoted words is clearly drawn from the courts . Often in the courts two sets of procedural witnesses testified at odds , so that not only might a litigant be lying about , say , the payment of a debt , but , of necessity , his " bought " witnesses would be lying with him ( or he would not have summoned them ) . As always , such litigants can win in actual trials ; the fourth-century courtroom speeches of the orators are full of accusations back and forth of testimony " bought . " But , so Heraclitus claims , Dike , Justice herself , will in the end convict ( a legal term ) such a lying litigant , and the ( procedural ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often there is an obvious meaning to a saying , one that focuses on a sharp , contemporary scene , as here , Behind the obvious meaning , as H. Gomperz perceptively observed , " there looms an indefinite number of more general and more profound meanings . " 44 The stylistic device has proved seductive to the fruitful imaginations of generations of Heraclitean interpreters , beginning already in antiquity . Modern philosophers have not been immune . My purpose here is only to clarify what , to a contemporary audience in Archaic Ephesus , would be the first , obvious meaning . A lying litigant and his procedural witnesses who spoke with him will stand convicted by Justice herself , whatever a court may do . <p> A final witness saying seems to have been garbled in transmission , and Diels-Kranz print it as 10la : <p> Eyes are more exact ( reliable ? ) 45 witnesses than ears . <p> Something presumably is missing as Heraclitus plays with a popular saying . If similar plays in the fragments can be used as a guide , anthropoi are again being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The thrust is hardly epistemological in a modern sense , nor is the meaning directly related to " sense experience " at all . <p> A popular saying is being manipulated , that is clear , a common Heraclitean stylistic device . Here we can be certain of its intention , as was the philosopher 's fifth-century Ionic audience , because the saying is independently attested in his fellow Ionian , Herodotus . We are not always so fortunate when dealing with Heraclitus ' manipulation of popular sayings , and some instances may have eluded detection . The original saying was to the effect that , in fact , human beings do trust personal experience over hearsay , one 's own eyes over one 's ears . Herodotus invents a moralizing conversation between King Candaules and the semimythical Gyges to explain how , generations earlier , Gyges came to the throne of Lydia . The King boasts to his favorite among his bodyguards , Gyges , that his wife is the most beautiful of women . To prove his boast he will secrete Gyges in the bedchamber of his wife to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setting in motion events that will destroy the King . For , claims the foolish King , quoting a saying as he thrusts a discomfited Gyges toward his wife 's bedroom , " men trust their ears ota , what they hear from others : hearsay less than their eyes . " 46 The saying is innocent of issues in epistemology ( though not of evidence in a court ) , and in no way is concerned with the relative reliability of our various senses . <p> The incomplete B101a of Heraclitus is obscure as it stands , for we have no context , and the probability is high that the adjective has been garbled in transmission . Ephesians knew the original popular saying , however , a situation which the philosopher assumes . The evidence of Herodotus strongly suggests that the thrust of the Heraclitean version was not that one sense , sight , is somehow more accurate , and so epistemologically superior to , another sense , hearing , as has all too often been argued . Can we speculate on its original thrust ? When Heraclitus combines the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ) , which in this period would be to a procedural witness , the reference plausibly evokes the fact that one who came forth as witness must have been personally present at the prior proceeding , an eyewitness . Direct personal experience is always considered best , and alone is admitted as evidence in court when a procedural witness testifies . Hearsay , the report from another of the testimony of a procedural witness , was never allowed in the courts , and would defeat the very idea of a " witness " as one summoned in advance to be present , and later to testify in the same manner . <p> Heraclitus had a notable aversion to taking matters on authority , especially when the authority was a canonical poet . His fellow Hellenes , anthropoi , had the opposite predilection , or so his polemic endlessly claims . A large number of sayings , as has often been observed , " attack the credentials of other persons of whom it is claimed that they are men of wisdom and intelligence , among whom Homer and Hesiod and Archilochus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the target was not only the poets themselves but those who recited their works in public gatherings . " 47 The important B104 castigates anthropoi for lacking wit and intelligence , suggesting the cause of their mental deficiency lies in their addiction to chasing after itinerant singers adored by the mob , and so they " take the many as their teacher . " Plausibly , the Heraclitean original of B101a , if we had its complete formulation , would be addressing the philosopher 's preference for personal investigation and inquiry over receiving pretended , and false , wisdom from others , dominantly poets and their contemporary reciters . B42 , which concerns beating up on Homer and expelling him from the contests , is framed in the present tense , and so refers to a contemporary agon of rhapsodes , Homer as recited in the philosopher 's day in the theater of Ephesus . B1 sounded this Heraclitean theme at the outset of the collection : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> B55 reads : PREFORMATTED TABLE Conclusion <p> Behind the clever witness sayings of Heraclitus , and illuminating their philosophical intention , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the popular courts of all Greek cities . When " eyes " is used in the sayings , the usage , as in popular speech and in literary sources , refers to " being present , " seeing for oneself , an " eyewitness " in the fundamental sense retained in many European languages and legal systems to this day . A reference to " ears " can refer to hearing for oneself , or , depending on the context , hearing only from another , " hearsay . " A " witness " with only hearsay information would not , in the technical sense of the Archaic courts , be referred to as a witness at all . <p> All the surviving witness sayings seem to belong to that large group of polemical sayings that hold anthropoi , most contemporary Greeks , up to ridicule ; something is wrong with the way they speak ( and hear ) and so , as well , how they think . The root cause , Heraclitus hints more than once , is that something has long been amiss in their " enculturation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all too passively the wrong authorities ; as a direct result , they are ever uncomprehending of the true logos , which stands forever , as B1 eloquently proclaims . B107 and B34 surely belong to this large group of polemical sayings . B28 , and B101a which seems incomplete , plausibly belong to it as well . <p> In his witness sayings Heraclitus exploits contemporary legal procedure and terminology , as we might expect of any pioneering thinker of the period who eschews the more common medium of traditional poetry in favor of the prose vernacular to communicate with his audience . In the sayings that are complete as transmitted he does so with the linguistic cleverness , bordering on eccentricity , 48 we expect of him . If the argument of this paper has been persuasive , then the Heraclitean witness sayings are intended to evoke the familiar figure of the procedural witness , summoned in advance " to see with his own eyes " and " hear with his own ears . " This wording , or something very close to it , is found in many cultures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , but because similar preliterate causes and situations provoked similar responses and solutions . For example , the ancient oath of the " unbought " witness from the Anglo-Saxon courts is ( in modernized speech ) : <p> In the name of Almighty God , as I here for Name in true witness stand , unbidden and unbought , so I with my eyes oversaw. and with my ears overheard , that which I with him say . <p> The impressive , alliterative words are a reminder that in many cultures , including the Greek , expressions involving " eyes " and " ears , " when associated with witnessing , refer to the act of formal eyewitnessing , or , by extension , actions closely related to it in appearance . " Eyes " and " ears " often become a shorthand expression for the act of eyewitnessing itself , or for observing for oneself . Thus , Greeks in territories occupied by Persians ( as Ephesus was for Heraclitus ' entire life ) referred to certain officials , the Royal Inspectors , as " the King 's eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their task , and absolute right , was to be present at any local transactions they wished and then to report directly to the King , bypassing the local satrap , and so serving as a check on him . The popular saying found in Herodotus to the effect that people trust their ears less than their eyes unquestionably refers , as we discovered , to the preference , regarded as proverbial and universal , for seeing and hearing a transaction for oneself rather than accepting a secondhand report . When such expressions occur in the philosopher Heraclitus modern interpreters are quick to discover lurking in them issues of epistemological import involving " sense data , " or the relative reliability of parts of our sensory apparatus as it signals the brain ( or soul ) . An exercise in exegetical caution may be in order . <p> I conclude that the language in the witness sayings , however enticing to later philosophy , does not seek to raise issues that are epistemological as that term is now used , and the reliability of the senses ( whether of two or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at stake in any of them . Anachronistic readings are best abandoned . The witness sayings were undeniably polemical , of course , and they were aimed at certain deficiencies in anthropoi , " most Hellenes . " The term can be strongly pejorative in Heraclitus , as has often been noted . In one clever saying after another , the intent of the philosopher seems to be to find new ways of telling his fellow Ephesians ( and so us ) that anthropoi are linguistically and cognitively diminished , incapacitated , uncomprehending , naive before traditional worthies at best and plain stupid for believing everything they are told by them at worst . 50 Blax anthropos ! <p> Modern philosophers need not be disheartened , nor conclude that , in abandoning epistemological reconstructions , there is no " real philosophy " for them to find here . For the reasons behind the Ephesian philosopher 's relentless polemic , aimed as it was at contemporary hearers and so at a contemporary situation , are still to be sought . That search may yet lead historians of Greek philosophy , and philosophy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
