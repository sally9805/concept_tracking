MEET THE MILLIONAIRE NEXT DOOR // These people can not be millionaires ! They do n't look like millionaires , they do n't dress like millionaires , they do n't eat like millionaires , they do n't act like millionaires  --  they do n't even have millionaire names . Where are the millionaires who look like millionaires ? // The person who said this was a vice president of a trust department . He made these comments following a focus group interview and dinner that we hosted for ten first-generation millionaires . His view of millionaires is shared by most people who are not wealthy . They think millionaires own expensive clothes , watches , and other status artifacts . We have found this is not the case . // As a matter of fact , our trust officer friend spends significantly more for his suits than the typical American millionaire . He also wears a $5,000 watch . We know from our surveys that the majority of millionaires never spent even one-tenth of $5,000 for a watch . Our friend also drives a current-model imported luxury car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only a minority drive a foreign motor vehicle . An even smaller minority drive foreign luxury cars . Our trust officer leases , while only a minority of millionaires ever lease their motor vehicles . // But ask the typical American adult this question : Who looks more like a millionaire ? Would it be our friend , the trust officer , or one of the people who participated in our interview ? We would wager that most people by a wide margin would pick the trust officer . But looks can be deceiving. // This concept is perhaps best expressed by those wise and wealthy Texans who refer to our trust officer 's type as // Big Hat No Cattle // We first heard this expression from a thirty-five-year-old Texan . He owned a very successful business that rebuilt large diesel engines . But he drove a ten-year-old car and wore jeans and a buckskin shirt . He lived in a modest house in a lower-middle-class area . His neighbors were postal clerks , firemen , and mechanics . // After he substantiated his financial success with actual numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not look pretty . I do n't play the part . . . do n't act it .... When my British partners first met me , they thought I was one of our truck drivers .... They looked all over my office , looked at everyone but me . Then the senior guy of the group said , " Oh , we forgot we were in Texas ! " I do n't own big hats , but I have a lot of cattle . // PORTRAIT Of A MILLIONAIRE // Who is the prototypical American millionaire ? What would he tell you about himself ? ( * ) // * I am a fifty-seven-year-old male , married with three children . About 70 percent of us earn 80 percent or more of our household 's income . // * About one in five of us is retired . About two-thirds of us who are working are self-employed . Interestingly , self-employed people make up less than 20 percent of the workers in America but account for two-thirds of the millionaires . Also , three out of four of us who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others are self-employed professionals , such as doctors and accountants . // * Many of the types of businesses we are in could be classified as dullnormal . We are welding contractors , auctioneers , rice farmers , owners of mobile-home parks , pest controllers , coin and stamp dealers , and paving contractors . // * About half of our wives do not work outside the home . The number-one occupation for those wives who do work is teacher . // * Our household 's total annual realized ( taxable ) income is $131,000 ( median , or 50th percentile ) , while our average income is $247,000 . Note that those of us who have incomes in the $500,000 to $999,999 category ( 8 percent ) and the $1 million or more category ( 5 percent ) skew the average upward . // * We have an average household net worth of $3.7 million . Of course , some of our cohorts have accumulated much more . Nearly 6 percent have a net worth of over $10 million . Again , these people skew our average upward . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a net worth of $1.6 million . // * On average , our total annual realized income is less than 7 percent of our wealth . In other words , we live on less than 7 percent of our wealth . // * Most of us ( 97 percent ) are homeowners . We live in homes currently valued at an average of $320,000 . About half of us have occupied the same home for more than twenty years . Thus , we have enjoyed significant increases in the value of our homes . // * Most of us have never felt at a disadvantage because we did not receive any inheritance . About 80 percent of us are first-generation affluent . // * We live well below our means . We wear inexpensive suits and drive American-made cars . Only a minority of us drive the current-model-year automobile . Only a minority ever lease our motor vehicles . // * Most of our wives are planners and meticulous budgeters . In fact , only 18 percent of us disagreed with the statement " Charity begins at home . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot more conservative with money than we are . // * We have a " go-to-hell fund . " In other words , we have accumulated enough wealth to live without working for ten or more years . Thus , those of us with a net worth of $1.6 million could live comfortably for more than twelve years . Actually , we could live longer than that , since we save at least 15 percent of our earned income . // * We have more than six and one-half times the level of wealth of our nonmillionaire neighbors , but , in our neighborhood , these nonmillionaires outnumber us better than three to one . Could it be that they have chosen to trade wealth for acquiring high-status material possessions ? // * As a group , we are fairly well educated . Only about one in five are not college graduates . Many of us hold advanced degrees . Eighteen percent have master 's degrees , 8 percent law degrees , 6 percent medical degrees , and 6 percent Ph.D.s. // * Only 17 percent of us or our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But 55 percent of our children are currently attending or have attended private schools . // * As a group , we believe that education is extremely important for ourselves , our children , and our grandchildren . We spend heavily for the educations of our offspring . // * About two-thirds of us work between forty-five and fifty-five hours per week . // * We are fastidious investors . On average , we invest nearly 20 percent of our household realized income each year . Most of us invest at least 15 percent . Seventy-nine percent of us have at least one account with a brokerage company . But we make our own investment decisions . // * We hold nearly 20 percent of our household 's wealth in transaction securities such as publicly traded stocks and mutual funds . But we rarely sell our equity investments . We hold even more in our pension plans . On average , 21 percent of our household 's wealth is in our private businesses . // * As a group , we feel that our daughters are financially handicapped in comparison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money even within the same occupational categories . That is why most of us would not hesitate to share some of our wealth with our daughters . Our sons , and men in general , have the deck of economic cards stacked in their favor . They should not need subsidies from their parents . // * What would be the ideal occupations for our sons and daughters ? There are about 3.5 millionaire households like ours . Our numbers are growing much faster than the general population . Our kids should consider providing affluent people with some valuable service . Overall , our most trusted financial advisors are our accountants . Our attorneys are also very important . So we recommend accounting and law to our children . Tax advisors and estate-planning experts will be in big demand over the next fifteen years . // * I am a tightwad . That 's one of the main reasons I completed a long questionnaire for a crispy $1 bill . Why else would I spend two or three hours being personally interviewed by these authors ? They paid me $100 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another offer  --  to donate in my name the money I earned for my interview to my favorite charity . But I told them , " I am my favorite charity . " // " WEALTHY " DEFINED // Ask the average American to define the term wealthy . Most would give the same definition found in Webster 's . Wealthy to them refers to people who have an abundance of material possessions . // We define wealthy differently . We do not define wealthy , affluent , or rich in terms of material possessions . Many people who display a high-consumption lifestyle have little or no investments , appreciable assets , income-producing assets , common stocks , bonds , private businesses , oil/gas rights , or timber land . Conversely , those people whom we define as being wealthy get much more pleasure from owning substantial amounts of appreciable assets than from displaying a high-consumption lifestyle . // THE NOMINAL DEFINITION OF WEALTHY // One way we determine whether someone is wealthy or not is based on net worth  --  " cattle , " not " chattel . " Net @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assets less liabilities ( exclude the principle in trust accounts ) . In this book we define the threshold level of being wealthy as having a net worth of $1 million or more . Based on this definition , only 3.5 million ( 3.5 percent ) of the 100 million households in America are considered wealthy . About 95 percent of millionaires in America have a net worth of between $1 million and $10 million . Much of the discussion in this book centers on this segment of the population . Why the focus on this group ? Because this level of wealth can be attained in one generation . It can be attained by many Americans . // HOW WEALTHY SHOWED YOU BE ? // Another way of defining whether or not a person , household , or family is wealthy is based on one 's expected level of net worth . A person 's income and age are strong determinants of how much that person should be worth . In other words , the higher one 's income , the higher one 's net worth is expected to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Similarly , the longer one is generating income , the more likely one will accumulate more and more wealth . So higher-income people who are older should have accumulated more wealth than lower-income producers who are younger . // For most people in America with annual realized incomes of $50,000 or more and for most people twenty-five to sixty-five years of age , there is a corresponding expected level of wealth . Those who are significantly above this level can be considered wealthy in relation to others in their income/age cohort . // You may ask : How can someone be considered wealthy if , for example , he is worth only $460,000 ? After all , he 's not a millionaire . Charles Bobbins is a forty-one-year-old fireman . His wife is a secretary . They have a combined annual income of $55,000 . According to our research findings , Mr. Bobbins should have a net worth of approximately $225,500 . But he is worth much more than others in his income/age category . Mr. and Mrs. Bobbins have been able to accumulate an above-average amount of net worth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fireman 's and secretary 's income and still save and invest a good bit . They likely have a low-consumption lifestyle . And given this lifestyle , Mr. Bobbins could sustain himself and his family for ten years without working . Within their income and age categories , the Bobbinses are wealthy . // The Bobbinses are quite different from John J. Ashton , M.D. , age fifty-six , who has an annual income of approximately $560,000 . How much is Dr. Ashton worth ? Is he wealthy ? According to one definition , he is , since his net worth is $1.1 million . But he is not wealthy according to our other definition . Given his age and income , he should be worth more than $3 million . // With his high-consumption lifestyle , how long do you think Dr. Ashton could sustain himself and his family if he were no longer employed ? Perhaps for two , at most three , years . // HOW TO DETERMINE IF YOU 'RE WEALTHY // Whatever your age , whatever your income , how much should you be worth right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we have developed several multivariate-based wealth equations . A simple rule of thumb , however , is more than adequate in computing one 's expected net worth . // Multiply your age times your realized pretax annual household income from all sources except inheritances . Divide by ten . This , less any inherited wealth , is what your net worth should be . // For example , if Mr. Anthony O. Duncan is forty-one years old , makes $143,000 a year , and has investments that return another $12,000 , he would multiply $155,000 by forty-one . That equals $6,355,000 . Dividing by ten , his net worth should be $635,500 . If Ms. Lucy R. Frankel is sixty-one and has a total annual realized income of $235,000 , her net worth should be $1,433,500. // Given your age and income , how does your net worth match up ? Where do you stand along the wealth continuum ? If you are in the top quartile for wealth accumulation , you are a PAW , or prodigious accumulator of wealth . If you are in the bottom quartile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Are you a PAW , a UAW , or just an AAW ( average accumulator of wealth ) ? // We have developed another simple rule . To be well positioned in the PAW category , you should be worth twice the level of wealth expected . In other words , Mr. Duncan 's net worth/wealth should be approximately twice the expected value or more for his income/age cohort , or $635,500 multiplied by two equals $1,271,000 . If Mr. Duncan 's net worth is approximately $1.27 million or more , he is a prodigious accumulator of wealth . Conversely , what if his level of wealth is one-half or less than expected for all those in his income/age category ? Mr. Duncan would be classified as a UAW if his level of wealth were $317,750 or less ( or one-half of $635,500 ) . // PAWs versus UAWs // PAWs are builders of wealth  --  that is , they are the best at building net worth compared to others in their income/age category . PAWs typically have a minimum of four times the wealth accumulated by UAWs . Contrasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most revealing parts of the research we have conducted over the past twenty years . // A good example of the difference between PAWs and UAWs is revealed in two case studies . Mr. Miller " Bubba " Richards , age fifty , is the proprietor of a mobile-home dealership . His total household income last year was $90,200 . Mr. Richards 's net worth , as computed via the wealth equation , is expected to be $451,000 . But " Bubba " is a PAW . His actual net worth is $1.1 million . // His counterpart is James H. Ford II . Mr. Ford , age fifty-one , is an attorney . His income last year was $92,330 , slightly more than Mr. Richards 's . What is Mr. Ford 's actual net worth ? His expected level of wealth ? Mr. Ford 's actual net worth is $226,511 , while his expected level of wealth ( again computed from the wealth equation ) is $470,883 . Mr. Ford , by our definition , is an under accumulator of wealth . Mr. Ford spent seven years in college . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealer ? In fact , Mr. Richards has nearly five times the net worth of Mr. Ford . And remember , both are in the same income/age cohort . In trying to answer the above question ask yourself two simpler questions : // * How much money does it take to maintain the upper-middle-class lifestyle of an attorney and his family ? // * How much money is required to maintain the middle-class or even blue-collar lifestyle of a mobile-home dealer and his family ? // Clearly , Mr. Ford , the attorney , must spend significantly more of his household 's income to maintain and display his family 's higher upper-middle-class lifestyle . What make of motor vehicle is congruent with the status of an attorney ? Foreign luxury , no doubt . Who needs to wear a different high-quality suit to work each day ? Who needs to join one or more country clubs ? Who needs expensive Tiffany silverware and serving trays ? // Mr. Ford , the UAW , has a higher propensity to spend than do the members of the PAW group . UAWs tend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they tend to de-emphasize many of the key factors that underlie wealth building . // YOU OR YOUR ANCESTORS ? // Most of America 's millionaires are first-generation rich . How is it possible for people from modest backgrounds to become millionaires in one generation ? Why is it that so many people with similar socioeconomic backgrounds never accumulate even modest amounts of wealth ? // Most people who become millionaires have confidence in their own abilities . They do not spend time worrying about whether or not their parents were wealthy . They do not believe that one must be born wealthy . Conversely , people of modest backgrounds who believe that only the wealthy produce millionaires are predetermined to remain non-affluent . Have you always thought that most millionaires are born with silver spoons in their mouths ? If so , consider the following facts that our research uncovered about American millionaires : // * Only 19 percent receive any income or wealth of any kind from a trust fund or an estate . // * Fewer than 20 percent inherited 10 percent or more of their wealth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $1 in inheritance . // * Fewer than 25 percent ever received " an act of kindness " of $10,000 or more from their parents , grandparents , or other relatives . // * Ninety-one percent never received , as a gift , as much as $1 of the ownership of a family business . // * Nearly half never received any college tuition from their parents or other relatives . // * Fewer than 10 percent believe they will ever receive an inheritance in the future . // America continues to hold great prospects for those who wish to accumulate wealth in one generation . In fact , America has always been a land of opportunity for those who believe in the fluid nature of our nation 's social system and economy . // More than one hundred years ago the same was true . In The American Economy , Stanley Lebergott reviews a study conducted in 1892 of the 4,047 American millionaires . He reports that 84 percent " were nouveau riche , having reached the top without the benefit of inherited wealth . " // BRITANNIA RULES ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation 's wealth was held by landowners . More than half the land was owned by people who either were born in England or were born in America of English parents . Is more than half of this nation 's wealth now of English origin ? No . One of the major myths concerning wealth in this country relates to ethnic origin . Too many people think that America 's affluent population is composed predominantly of direct descendants of the Mayflower voyagers. // Let 's examine this assumption objectively . What if " country of origin " were the major factor in explaining variation in wealth ? We would expect that more than half of America 's millionaire population would be of English ancestry . This is not the case ( see Table 1-1 ) . In our most recent national survey of millionaires , we asked the respondents to designate their country of origin/ancestry/ethnic origin . The results may surprise you . // Those designating " English " as their ethnic origin accounted for 21.1 percent of the millionaire population . People of English origin account for 10.3 percent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American millionaires of English origin are more prevalent than expected , given their numbers in the entire U.S. population ( 10.3 percent versus 21.1 percent ) . In other words , this group has a millionaire concentration ratio of 2.06 ( 21.1 percent of all millionaire households divided by 10.3 percent of all households headed by persons of English origin ) , meaning that people of English origin are about twice as likely to head households in the millionaire category than would be expected from their portion of all households in America . // And yet , what percentage of the English ancestry group in America is in the millionaire category ? Would you expect the English group to rank first ? In fact , it ranks fourth . According to our research , 7.71 percent of all households in the English category have a net worth of $1 million or more . Three other ancestry groups have significantly higher concentrations of millionaires . // How can it be possible that the English ancestry group does not have the highest concentration of millionaire households ? After all , they were among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were on the ground floor to take economic advantage in this land of opportunity . In 1790 Colonial America , more than two-thirds of households were headed by a self-employed person . In America , the achievements of the current generation are more a factor in explaining wealth accumulation than what has taken place in the past . Again , most American millionaires today ( about 80 percent ) are first-generation rich . Typically , the fortunes built by these people will be completely dissipated by the second or third generation . The American economy is a fluid one . There are many people today who are on their way to becoming wealthy . And there are many others who are spending their way out of the affluent category . // WINNING ANCESTRY GROUPS // If the English ancestry group does not have the highest concentration of millionaire households , then which group does ? The Russian ancestry group ranks first , the Scottish ranks second , and the Hungarian ranks third . Although the Russian ancestry group accounts for only about 1.1 percent of all households in America , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We estimate that approximately 22 of every 100 households headed by someone of Russian ancestry has a net worth of $1 million or more . This is in sharp contrast to the English ancestry group , in which only 7.71 in 100 of its members are in the millionaire league . How much wealth does this Russian American millionaire group have in total ? We estimate approximately $1.1 trillion , or nearly 5 percent of all the personal wealth in America today ! // How can one explain the economic productivity of Russian Americans ? In general , most American millionaires are manager-owners of businesses . Russians in disproportionate numbers are manager-owners of businesses . Further , this entrepreneurial spirit seems to translate from one generation of Russians to the next . // The Hungarian ancestry group also is entrepreneurially inclined . This group accounts for only 0.5 percent of all households in this country . Yet it makes up 2 percent of the millionaire households . Contrast this with the German ancestry group , which accounts for nearly one in five households ( 19.5 percent ) in this country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons of German ancestry , and only about 3.3 percent of German households are in the millionaire league . // THRIFTY SCOTS // The Scottish ancestry group makes up only 1.7 percent of all households . But it accounts for 9.3 percent of the millionaire households in America . Thus , in terms of concentration , the Scottish ancestry group is more than five times ( 5.47 ) more likely to contain millionaire households than would be expected from its overall portion ( 1.7 percent ) of American households . // The Scottish ancestry group ranks second in terms of the percentage of its clan that are in the millionaire league . Nearly twenty-one ( 20.8 ) in 100 of its households are millionaires . What explains the Scottish ancestry group 's high ranking ? It is true that many Scots were early immigrants to America . But this is not the major reason for their economic productivity . Remember that the English were among the earliest immigrants , yet their concentration numbers are far lower than those of the Scots . Also consider that the Scots did not enjoy the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years the nation was in its infancy . Given these facts , one would think that the English ancestry group would account for a higher concentration of millionaire households than those in the Scottish group . But just the opposite is the case . Again , the Scottish ancestry group has a concentration level nearly three times that of the English group ( 5.47 versus 2.06 ) . What then makes the Scottish ancestry group unique ? // If an ancestry group has a high concentration of millionaires , what would we expect the income characteristics of that group to be ? The expectation is that the group would have an equally high concentration of high-income producers . Income is highly correlated with net worth ; more than two-thirds of the millionaires in America have annual household incomes of $100,000 or more . In fact , this correlation exists for all major ancestry groups but one : the Scottish . This group has a much higher number of high-net worth households than can be explained by the presence of high-income-producing households alone . High-income-producing Scottish-ancestry households account for less than 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Scottish ancestry group accounts for 9.3 percent of the millionaire households in America today . More than 60 percent of Scottish-ancestry millionaires have annual household incomes of less than $100,000 . No other ancestry group has such a high concentration of millionaires from such a small concentration of high-income-producing households . // If income does not come near in explaining the affluence of the Scottish ancestry group in America , what factors do shed light on this phenomenon ? There are several fundamental factors . // First , Scottish Americans tend to be frugal . Given a household 's income , there is a corresponding mathematical expectation of level of consumption . Members of this group do not fit such expectations . On average , they live well below the norm for people in various income categories . They often live in self-designed environments of relative scarcity . A household of Scottish ancestry with an annual income of $100,000 will often consume at a level typical for an American household with an annual income of $85,000 . Being frugal allows them to save more and invest more than others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ household of Scottish descent saves and invests at a level comparable to the typical American household that annually earns nearly $150,000. // In the chapters that follow , we reveal the highest prices typical millionaires reported paying for suits , shoes , watches , and motor vehicles . A significantly greater number of millionaires with Scottish ancestry reported paying less for each item than the norm for all millionaires in the sample . For example , more than two-thirds ( 67.3 percent ) of Scottish millionaires paid less for their most expensive motor vehicle than the norm for all millionaires surveyed . // Because they accumulate wealth , the Scottish-ancestry affluent have wealth to pass on to their offspring . Our research reveals that Scottish offspring typically become economically and emotionally independent even as young adults . Thus , they tend not to drain their parents ' wealth . // Members of the Scottish-ancestry group have been able to instill their values of thrift , discipline , economic achievement , and financial independence in successive generations . These values are also typical traits among most self-made millionaires . // SMALL POPULATIONS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affluent . Yet many contain high concentrations of wealthy households . What small groups in particular ? We estimate that all of the fifteen small-population ancestry groups shown in Table 1-2 have at least twice the proportion of millionaires than the proportion for all U.S. households . Only about 3.5 percent of all U.S. households are in the million-dollar net worth league . All the groups listed in Table 1-2 are estimated to contain at least twice this proportion . ( In total , all fifteen account for less than 1 percent of all affluent households . ) In fact , there is compelling evidence of an inverse relationship between the size of an ancestry group and the proportion of its members that are wealthy . In other words , larger ancestry groups contain smaller proportions of millionaires on average than smaller groups . // What about the number of years that an average member of an ancestry group has been in America ? The longer the time here , the less likely it will produce a disproportionately large percentage of millionaires . Why is this the case ? Because we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the average member of an ancestry group has been in America , the more likely he or she will become fully socialized to our high-consumption lifestyle . There is another reason . First-generation Americans tend to be self-employed . Self-employment is a major positive correlate of wealth . // This is not to suggest that self-employment and/or being first-generation American ensures membership among the ranks of millionaires . Most self-employed Americans will never accumulate even modest levels of wealth . The same is true for most first-generation Americans . But twenty-three million people in this country today were born elsewhere . That is a large gene pool . Note also that 12 percent of INC. magazine 's top five hundred business entrepreneurs are first-generation American . // One might expect that the sons , daughters , grandsons , and granddaughters of these people would automatically become even more successful economically than they . Not really . We will discuss intergenerational transfers in more detail in Chapters 5 and 6 , but allow us at this juncture to explain why the " next generation " is often less productive economically than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case of Victor , a successful entrepreneur who is first-generation American .

Do their children also become roofing contractors , excavation contractors , scrap metal dealers , and so on ? The chances are they do n't . Fewer than one in five do . // No , Victor wants his children to have a better life . He encourages them to spend many years in college . Victor wants his children to become physicians , lawyers , accountants , executives , and so on .

And , of course , he encourages them to reject his lifestyle of thrift and a self-imposed environment of scarcity. // Victor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what exactly does Victor mean when he says that ?

He does not realize that being well educated has certain economic drawbacks . // Victor 's well-educated adult children have learned that a high level of consumption is expected of people who spend many years in college and professional schools . Today his children are under accumulators of wealth . They are the opposite of their father , the blue-collar , successful business owner . His children have become Americanized .

We were hired by Toddy , a corporate vice president of a subsidiary of a large corporation . Toddy 's ancestors were English . His forefathers were in America before the Revolutionary War . More recently , they owned steel mills in Pennsylvania . Toddy , their direct descendant , attended an exclusive prep school in New England . Later he graduated from Princeton University . While in college , he played varsity football . // Toddy , like many people in this country , had always believed that wealthy people inherited their fortunes .

Who was this Alex fellow , anyway ? His father had immigrated to this country from Russia before Alex was born . His dad was a small business owner . Alex had graduated from a state university . " How could it be possible , " Toddy asked , " that this fellow wants to , and has the resources to , buy the company ? " Alex 's dad answered the question quite succinctly : // Russians  --  they are the best horse traders . // Alex is a self-made multimillionaire . His is the prototypical American success story .

It is , therefore , impossible in most cases to say with certainly whether our typical millionaire is a he or a she . Nevertheless , because 95 percent of millionaire households are composed of married couples , and because in 70 percent of these cases the male head of the household contributes at least 80 percent of the income , we will usually refer to the typical American millionaire as " he " in this book .
