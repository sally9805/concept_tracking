When I saw the sign for piglets I told my father to stop the car . " I want to buy one , " I said , attempting to say this with conviction . The thought of raising a pig over the summer had come as suddenly as the sign . <p> " How are you going to raise a pig when you 're so busy reading Wittgenstein ? " he asked , but he turned onto a dirt road which led up a small hill . <p> I wanted to read Wittgenstein 's Philosophical Investigations all summer and somehow still be able to make some money for my senior year of college . As my father drove , I had gone on at length about how smart I was compared to my philosophy class nemesis , Peter Meltzer , the would-be valedictorian . My father listened , but after a few stabs at advice ( " You should n't be so concerned about the guy , just yourself " ) , he adopted a pose which I thought of as his film noir self : wrist cocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road ahead , brow furrowed in what appeared to be concentration , but was more likely a headache . I was sure anyone who grew up in the Fifties could do it . I played the role of the dame he did n't want to hear another word from . <p> " Meltzer 's just a grind , " I said . " He reads every secondary source on a philosopher before he comes to class . I swear he plagiarizes , and he 's too slick at it to get caught . " <p> My father nodded and made a throaty sound : the same he made toward my mother when she was off on a rant . That made me more determined . How could he imagine how humiliating it had been to be pitted against Peter Meltzer . Every week we took one side of an issue assigned by Professor Blackmon . We were asked to share our notes ahead of time , so that our in-class debate over some Meta-ethical issue would be more intense . Was the concept of morality a condition of rational discourse ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The topics were always immense ; Meltzer 's notes went on at least twenty pages , and were typed . Mine were four or five pages , handwritten , and rambling . What really pissed me off was the fact that Meltzer was such a gentleman . In debating me , he would ask if perhaps I had made a mistake , and cite the references I had bungled . He was witty , charming , and a liar . He had the professor in his hand . And when Meltzer brought up an issue discussed by Wittgenstein in Philosophical Investigations ( one I was certain he had read about somewhere else ) , and Professor Blackmon said , " That 's an interesting reading of Wittgenstein , Peter , but I believe the Philosophical Investigations is a book that can not be read outside of a course  --  one I 'm planning to teach in the fall , " I knew then that I would spend my summer learning just what Wittgenstein wrote . I would know it backwards and forwards , without commentary ; I would learn the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " You got a job , " my father said . " Your mother set you up at the hospital . In the kitchen . " He maneuvered the car around several gullies that cut across the road . <p> " I would have found a job on my own , " I said . <p> " Sure , but now you do n't have to look . " The car scraped against some rocks . He cursed . <p> " What does it entail ? " <p> My father cleared his throat , rolled down the window , and spat . " It enn-tails , " he said , drawing the words out , " washing pots and pans . " <p> Just what I did n't need , a job like that . Hard work and fatigue . It would make Wittgenstein a chore at night . <p> The farm was a series of ramshackle wood buildings , all a weathered gray tone . Not the kind of place you expect to find in northwestern Connecticut , where well-to-do people from New York City were buying rundown places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , outlets for native honey and jam , psychiatric retreats , meditation centers , rehabs for one addiction or another , or colonies for painters , playwrights , and potters . It was hard to imagine how these locusts of good taste had missed it . I liked it at first sight , as desolate as it was ; there was desperation here . There almost certainly had to be a beheaded chicken in the kitchen sink , blood forming a pool around its carcass . The barn probably had n't been cleaned in months . The man , when he was even there , was in a rage against the things he did n't understand  --  quite possibly everything in his life  --  and was ready to slaughter his family and go fishing . All this seemed confirmed when a short , squat woman with brown hair and a pimpled face emerged from the main house carrying a diapered infant in her arm . There was a little kid behind her , his dirty hands clinging to her dungaree jacket . <p> " How much are the pigs ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , and coughed . She sounded tubercular , and did n't look much older than I was . " They 're already neutered , that 's why . " <p> I stuck my hand into my pocket and pulled out a ten and a twenty , all I had left from my last paycheck at school . We took two pigs , Camus and Sartre , I named them , and put them in the trunk . <p> " You 're just like they are , " my father said as he spun out of the driveway onto the main road . " You 're just like those goddamn New Yorkers . " <p> Rupert , the head chef , spent fifteen minutes showing me the proper procedure for washing pots and pans . When his voice rose above a mumble it was whiny and nasty . <p> " Let me give you the big sketch here , " he said , pointing to the stainless steel tub divided into three sections . " This is your soak sink , the middle one 's your wash sink , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white plastic : bottle from a shelf and emptied it in the soak sink . " Disinfectant . Just a bit every time you change the water . You follow ? " <p> Like this was all so tough . I nodded without looking too smug . My new white shirt tugged at my armpits . I had to wear that and black chinos . <p> " What you have here are your steam pipes , " he said , pointing to copper tubes below the surface of the water in each sink . " You heat the water up like so ... " He turned a faucet on in each sink , producing an explosion of syncopated metallic hammering that made it impossible to hear him . <p> " What ? " I yelled . <p> " You heat the water up as hot as you can stand it , " he repeated . " The soak sink is the most important . " <p> I pulled on my long black glover  --  it extended above my elbow  --  and dropped my hand into the water . It was hotter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's hot , " I said . <p> " You got the sketch , then , " Rupert said , and patted me on the back . " Laurie and I are the chefs today . We got baked macaroni and cheese for lunch . We need a lot of pots . If you 've got any questions , see me . Your head chef is like the captain of a ship . You owe him your total allegiance . So do n't ask Peejay nothing . " <p> Peejay was the other pot washer . He showed up about fifteen minutes late , pulled on his black rubber gloves , and stuck one hand into each sink . " Naw , naw , naw , " he said , turning on the steam in each . <p> " What 's the matter ? " I asked . <p> " Naw , too cold , " he said without looking at me . <p> " Wait a second , I ca n't stand it now . It 's too hot for me . " I reached to turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my side , and after I finished turning it off , he turned it back on . <p> " Too cold , " he said . He pushed my hand away from the steam faucet . " Naw . " <p> He was at least fifty years old , his head oddly large for his body , which was smaller than mine . He might have been five foot five . When he stared at me , he kept his mouth open . His lips were dry and cracked , his eyes suspicious , almost squashed beneath his bushy brown eyebrows . His hair was uncombed and not recently washed , full of cowlicks and snarls that gradually loosened as the steam and heat of the pot room got into them . <p> By ten o'clock break , I had sweated through my shirt and my skin was covered with a film of chlorine and detergent . In the hospital cafeteria ! saw Rupert sitting by himself . " Take a seat , " he said , kicking a chair out with his foot from beneath the table . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a soggy , half-smoked cigar he attempted for a minute or two to relight with a Bic lighter . <p> " Screw it , " he said , and pulled out a new cigar from his pocket . " So how 's your day going ? " <p> " Just fine , " I said . <p> " So give me the word on Peejay . " <p> I knew better than that . I did n't say anything without knowing where Rupert stood . " What is a word really ? " I had read in Wittgenstein the very night before . " What is a piece in chess ? " <p> " He 's a little , you know ... " I said finally , stammering into a theatrical pause . <p> " Retarded ? " Rupert asked , blowing smoke above my head . <p> " Yeah , I guess . " I wanted to say something wiseass , but resisted . I thought of my mother working in the Supply Office , seeing these guys every week from now until who knew when , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had said or done this summer . <p> " I 'll say he 's retarded , " Rupert said . " He 's a dummy , and he 's been here for fifteen years . Part of the good stuff the hospital tries to do . " <p> I looked around for Peejay . Even though I did n't want to work with him , it would be cruel if he overheard us . " Where is he ? " I asked . " Does n't he get a break ? " <p> " As if he even knows the difference , " Rupert said . " He 's outside . Look . " Rupert pointed toward the parking lot in back . Peejay was there , waving his arms as if he were pleading a case before a jury . <p> " What 's going on ? " I asked . <p> " Get this sketch , " Rupert said . " He 's got some imaginary friend out there . He 's had him ever since I 've been here , and that 's five years . I used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bon Spoon , but they did n't have retirement . This place is lucky to have me . " <p> When Laurie said , " New guy , huh ? " I knew I was slow . She was Rupert 's first assistant chef , and strictly all business . Fat and expressionless , her face the color of mashed potatoes , she appeared with pots and pans which she tossed into the soak sink , saying only , " Need these back fast . " This had gone on ever since break , her dirty pot-and-pan runs becoming more frequent as lunch approached . Peejay , who got on my nerves by kicking back pots for more soaking , grunted something I could n't make out . I never saw him leave . The pots and pans kept coming in . I assumed Peejay was doing something elsewhere . I soaked , washed , and rinsed as fast as I could . <p> On Laurie 's next visit , she said , " Peejay took off again , did n't he ? " <p> Still scrubbing a stinking pan caked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and must have looked confused . <p> " He 's in the goddamn bathroom again , " Laurie said . " I 'll get him . " She came back in a few minutes , holding Peejay by the ear . <p> " Get back to work , you bum , " she said , shoving him toward the sink . " And you , " she added , looking at me , " c'mere . " <p> " Naw , naw , naw , " Peejay said , turning on the steam as I walked around the corner with Laurie . <p> " Do n't ever trust him , " Laurie said . " And do n't ever lend him five bucks . He hits up every new guy for five and never pays him back . " <p> I was n't prepared to raise pigs . But if I admitted that fact to my father it would be remembered for years , and flung in my face over any decision I reached . <p> I made a pen out of snow fence I got from a farmer , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so small , at first I was worried they 'd get out somehow . But they did n't seem to want to leave . I had trouble keeping Camus and Sartre straight in my mind , both of them Hampshires , although Sartre did have a little birthmark behind one of his ears . Gradually they developed different personalities . Camus ran to the fence first when I came with food ; Sartre followed slowly and grunted more . On rainy days , he had to be coaxed by Camus 's snorts of satisfaction at the trough . After one week I had spent most of my hospital paycheck on medicine and feed from Agway . <p> " If they die , " my father said , " you bury them . " I could tell he 'd been working on a good lecture . He could n't wait for me to screw up . <p> But I was n't about to let them die . I wanted them for slaughter in the fall , after the first frost , the guy at Agway told me . I had found a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved the expression , " dressing them out "  --  and made arrangements for them to be picked up by the owner of the place . He would keep a third of the meat in return for the work . My father would pay me a fair price for his share of the meat . <p> Each night , after feeding Camus and Sartre , I went in , ate a cold dinner , and shut myself in my room , my cell , a dry-walled partition off the garage , to read Wittgenstein . I had read his Tractatus Logico-philosphicus , a work in which he asserted that whatever was the case in the world was ultimately a picture of a thought as expressed by a sentence . So all the true sentences summed up exactly what corresponded to the truth of the universe . But he had renounced this work , in part because it could not explain the truth of ethical statements or expressions of love or anger . In his later work he explored the possibility that language was a game in which situations altered the meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he wrote . " You approach from one side and know your way about ; you approach the same place from another side and no longer know your way about . " This accounted for the truth and the relativity of values . His culminating work , Philosophical Investigations was said to be understood by only his closest inner circle , two of whom taught at Cornell . I intended to make a pilgrimage there in the fall , to ask them questions about this man who died in a bare white room , who was born to one of the richest families in Vienna , only to give his fortune away , who lived a Spartan existence dedicated to philosophy , who was a virtuoso cello player , who had fought for Austria during World War I and volunteered to the British Armed Services during World War II , aiding a team of doctors in developing a way to estimate the severity of war wounds . I wanted to become their student . As Camus and Sartre hung from meat hooks in a freezer , their fatty flanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be dazzling Professor Blackmon with my understanding of Wittgenstein 's most complex work . " You must let me speak to his greatest students , " I imagined myself saying to him . <p> I asked Peejay if his name was initial P , initial J , or Peejay , spelled out . He looked at me and said , " Naw , " and so I decided it was spelled out . Besides his ability to trick me into doing most of the pots and pans , Peejay knew a lot about what to avoid . He disappeared whenever macaroni and cheese was on the menu . But I knew where to find him , and did n't let him get away with it . He seemed to respect that . <p> " The big sketch is , he 's a devious dope , " Rupert told me one coffee break . " I 've seen his type before , and I allude to my experience with them . " <p> But I was more interested in Peejay and his imaginary friend than in his deviousness . I learned that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ YMCA to work , waited for him outside during the day , and returned with him at night . " He knows me , all right , " Peejay said , nodding his head . <p> " So what 's your friend 's name ? " I asked . He did n't answer . One day when he reached to turn on the steam , one of his gloves hooked by the sleeve on the pipe just as the steam began pouring out . When he tried to yank his arm free , the glove held and for a second or more his wailing muted even the hammering din of the steam . I pushed his arm down , freeing the glove , turned on the cold water , and stuck the pink stretch of skin between his elbow and his wrist under it . I ran out and got ice . The water in my wash sink had been so cool it saved him from getting a severe burn . He missed the rest of the day . <p> When he came back the next morning he smiled at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Peejay said , and I knew he was talking about his friend . It caught me off-guard . Over the sinks , drenched with sweat and Wittgenstein , I ceased to look at Peejay as anyone but an acceptable companion . The chef 's helpers , all three of them , thought his invisible friend was the funniest thing they 'd ever seen . We played poker during break , and they could n't believe I put up with him . The invisible buddy of Peejay was the main topic . <p> They would ask things like , " Does he get in your way ? Do you ever bump into him ? " They were the idiots . " Do you think he means it ? " I asked . <p> " Mean what ? " one of them asked . <p> " His friend , the invisible one , " I said . <p> They appeared confused by my question . Sure , their expressions suggested . I grinned back at them , remembering a passage from the master : " But is n't it our ' meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And meaning is something in the sphere of the mind ... something private . It is the intangible something , only comparable to consciousness itself ... It is , as it were , a dream of our language . " <p> It was simple after all . I thought of what Wittgenstein wrote : " The results of philosophy are the uncovering of one or another piece of plain nonsense , and of the bumps that understanding has got by running its head up against the limits of language . " He went on , " These bumps make us see the value of discovery . " <p> Camus and Sartre grew at an amazing rate . Starter pellets gave way to fifty-pound bags of specially formulated high-protein prepared feeds . They went through two per week at twelve dollars a bag . When they saw me coming each night they raced to the trough for dinner . <p> " In two weeks , guys , we 're switching to finisher pellets , " I said , smiling . " And you know what that means . " Camus looked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smarter of the two . He responded to everything I said . <p> Word of my project got around the hospital , because my mother talked about it in the supply room . A doctor told me one day in the cafeteria that pigs were smarter than dogs ; that they could be trained as house pets . Their skin , he went on , is closest to a human 's . Every pharmaceutical company is required to test new ointments and perfumes on the skin of a pig before testing it on people . That night I kidded Camus as I poured a container of sour milk on him . The clumps stuck to his snout and frustrated his vigorous efforts to remove them . " It 's just a beauty paste , sweetie , " I said . " Keep it there overnight . " Finally I swiped the clumps off with my hand , and let him lick it . His tongue felt like it had a life of its own , prickly and strong , and I jumped back . Camus went still , as if confused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side , and I swore he winked at me . <p> " The only true question for pigs , " I said , " is , ' When 's the first frost . ' " Camus snorted back . I could tell the difference between their snorts . They spoke  --  not my language but their own  --  they expressed surprise , delight , and fear . They nudged and budged one another for position at the trough , one 's nip to the ear producing a ripping squeal of anger . At the end , trough licked clean , they teased me with shakes of their snouts , skeptical that I had emptied the last drop from a pail . Looking at Sartre as sour milk dripped from the whiskers on his snout , I could n't mistake his gratitude . Had I ever felt that way toward someone ? He was hungry ; I brought him food . In the growing dark , I listened to the sound of their smacking and sucking . And as the day 's invisible stars emerged from the sky overhead , I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and communicate with someone invisible , far beyond anything I 'd ever done . I rinsed out the sour-milk container in a pail of water and poured that into their water trough . <p> One time my father surprised me while I was feeding them . " Have you noticed , " I asked , " how they come when I call them ? They 're smart . " <p> " You call that intelligence ? " my father asked . <p> " Sure . " <p> " A meat animal that comes when it 's called ? " <p> " They trust me , " I said . <p> " Why should they ? " he asked . <p> When the hospital hired Cindy , a gift from a female detention center , as a tray runner , things changed in the kitchen . She had stolen things , they said . Been a fence . Been busted for drugs . " She 's a slut , " one of the chef 's helpers told me . " She hangs out at the bars and deals dope . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tray runner told me . " Her mom 's a whore on the Northside . " <p> " What is this , hearsay ? " I asked . " What are we talking about. ? " <p> " We 're talking about someone we should n't be working with , " the tray runner said . " She 's gross . Just look at her . " <p> I did look at Cindy . She did n't look like a whore . She did n't wear makeup . Her skin was clean , her eyes sharp and green . But you could tell she had lived a tough life . She stared back at you if you looked at her , turning away only after she seemed to have dismissed you . She hated all of us , I could see that . But that made her all the more appealing to me . When I stared at her straight on , the rest of her seemed to dissolve until all I could see were her eyes . It was like shining a flashlight on an animal at night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had thick black hair cut short , and a way of walking that told me she did n't give a shit about anything . I could n't wait to ask her out . <p> " Po , " Peejay said . <p> " What ? " I shouted above the sound of the steam pipes . Peejay had at last convinced me that the hotter the water , the easier it was to clean the pots . <p> " Po lives on the Y , " he said . <p> At first , I thought he said , " Po lives on the why , " and I thought of Wittgenstein : " I experience the because . " Po lives on the why ? What could it mean ? I scraped a wad of burnt macaroni and cheese from the side of a silver stainless-steel pan and stared at Peejay . " What ? " I asked . <p> " On the roof , " Peejay said , as if I understood . " Po lives on the Y. You can see everything there . " <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We understood each other . His friend was Po . No one else knew that name . And I would n't tell anyone . The name of his friend had come to me only through hours of scrubbing . We were buddies now . I did n't tattle on him when he scooted out to the bathroom when there was bad work to do . We covered for each other . I had begun saving garbage for Camus and Sartre in the black plastic bags that otherwise went to the dumpster . Before a pan was cleaned , Peejay or I scraped its remnants into my bag . Prior to scraping a pan before soaking it , he 'd ask , " Pig food ? , " I 'd nod , and he would put it in the bag . <p> " Po do n't like bad boys , " he said . " Po said you 're okay . " <p> I liked being okay with Po . I learned that Po liked ice cream and Gilligan 's Island . As Peejay talked , the sound of the voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this thing was , our language , these sounds out of air and split , by muscle hurled out the cavity opposite the one we evacuate from , the means by which we expressed love and happiness , groped and misspoke . <p> When Smitty , one of the chef 's helpers , started at the Culinary Institute of America in July , they made me the junior chef 's helper , in charge of starches and vegetables . Another pot-and-pan washer replaced me alongside Peejay . I liked the promotion . It gave me a chance to get closer to Cindy , and to get more food for Camus and Sartre . Cindy came in at eleven in the morning usually , I noticed , in a ' 57 Chew driven by a creepy-looking guy older than I was . At two o'clock break , I ignored the other helpers , whose card games bored me , and sat by myself at an empty cafeteria table . I stared at Cindy . When I saw her watching Peejay out the window , I moved over to her table . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off each morning your boyfriend ? " <p> Cindy peeled the top off her empty Styrofoam coffee cup . " Is that your business ? " <p> " Why do you hang out with that guy ? " I asked , aware of the other tray runners watching us from a nearby table . I was the first to sit with her . <p> " Get lost , " she said , squashing the cup . <p> " I 'm just curious . " <p> " So am I. Why do you hang out with Peejay ? " <p> " I do n't hang out with him . " <p> " But you do n't try to get away from him , either . " <p> " He 's crazy , " I said , hoping to strike up a conversation , setting my coffee down and pulling out a chair . <p> " So what ? " she said . " I might be crazy . " <p> " We all might be crazy , " I said , immediately feeling like the college boy . <p> " Yeah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because we 're crazy ? " <p> I did n't know how to respond . " I guess it does n't matter , " I said . <p> " What do you want to do ? " she said , staring at me . <p> " What do you mean ? " <p> " You want to sleep with me ? " <p> I laughed because I could n't think what else to do . " Why do you ask ? " I said . <p> " Because , " she said . " What else could you care about  --  some smart boy like you ? " <p> " Yeah , I guess you 're right . That about sums it up . " <p> She smiled and patted the back of my hand , which was fiat on the table . " You 're doing okay for someone who works in this dump . " <p> When he was eight , Wittgenstein is said to have asked his father , " Why should one tell the truth if it 's to one 's advantage to tell a lie ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the most conventional sense . To have appeared offended at her remark and left the table . But it hit me she would have seen that for a ruse . <p> As we walked back into the kitchen , the other tray runners glared at me . I had betrayed them , each of them , although I knew not a one . When I saw Peejay approaching later that afternoon , I wanted to stop him . Maybe for just a quick chat . Maybe to soothe my conscience . " How 's Po ? " I asked as he passed . He ignored me . <p> " Wait a second , " I said , following him . <p> Peejay kept on walking . He stopped at the sink and went through the routine of heating up the water . <p> " Peejay , " I said , " talk to me . What 's the matter here ? " <p> Peejay never turned from the sink . He put on his gloves and began scrubbing . " You 're out there , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about wishing him well . Fie did n't care . I was gone . <p> Camus and Sartre never ate better . " Bon appetit , " I said as I tipped over trays of potatoes au gratin , potatoes lyonnaise , mashed potatoes , and baked potatoes , they loved them all . Sour milk , fresh milk , cheese sauce , and cream . They came , they snorted , they ate . To Sartre I said , " Do n't ask me , ask a priest . " Each day I overshot the menu laid out by the hospital 's dietitian . Twenty dinners of potatoes became forty . Vegetables , the same . No one questioned what was going on , not even Rupert , the captain . My expertise at the language game of lying went up , my feed bill at Agway went down . Once a week Peejay glared at me from the pot room as I tossed turkey bones into the stock kettle and added water . The steam to heat them reverberated its metallic rap reminiscent of the pot room . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overtures . I continued to sit with her at break . I listened to her , so I claimed , as a friend . She could talk to me , I told her . One break , I heard about her bad mother . " She never wanted me , and never let me forget it . " On another break , she told me about her missing father . " My mother said every time she looked at my face she saw him . " More than once she talked about the detention center . " The guards there are all dykes . They ca n't wait to push you around , and they always find a way to grab you so it hurts . You have to get friendly to avoid it . " I did n't ask her whether she did . <p> I listened without saying anything , convinced silence was the only language she would n't suspect . A week after we began talking , a Friday morning , we were at break when she said , " Basically it comes down to this : life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 're back down again . " <p> " So let 's go out anyway , " I said . <p> " You 're just lonesome , you know . I 'm not your friend . " <p> " What 's the difference , then ? " <p> " Sure , " she said . " What does it matter ? " <p> As the leaves dried and scraped against one another , and the weatherman droned on about the possibility of an early frost , as the sun burned weakly on my back and I carried tray after tray of overshot menu items to my mother 's car , one final supper after another for my buddies , I felt that the doctor was right : that I had never known a smarter animal than a pig , and that  --  and this thought stung me the most  --  in the grand scale of things I would always be closer to Peejay than to Wittgenstein . <p> When Cindy offered to buy some joints before our first date , I asked if she could also pick up a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Sure , " she said . " No problem . " <p> I gave her the money . I waited for her in my mother 's car , vacuumed for a good impression , and contemplated possible explanations for not returning home that night . The car broke down , I was drunk and did n't want to drive , any good lie would do . <p> Finding an excuse did n't turn out to be the problem . Cindy emerged from the laundromat where her dealer worked in handcufs . I opened the door of the car and before I could clear my head almost started to walk toward her . Then it came over me : Let her go . She 's not worth it . <p> Cindy saw me . She smiled and shrugged as she was being shoved into the back of a police cruiser . I wondered if there was something I should do . Should I get her a lawyer ? Should I see her in jail ? In the end I did nothing . <p> " The only true question , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the better part of valor . " I walked around the pen slowly , the light fading . I slappedd mosquitoes and chatted with the pigs . At first they followed me around the perimeter , careful to avoid their latrine area . " You guys do n't really understand me , do you ? " I said . " You 're not that smart . Not smart enough . " <p> My father called me one Wednesday in early September . Someone down eht hall fetched me from my room . Camus and Sartre were gone , he told me . The frost had come . But he had never seen two animals fight harder going up a ramp . He said he owed me more than $400 . <p> " It was like they knew , " he said . " They each had a noose around his neck and they fought like hell . It took three of us . " <p> I dropped my course in Wittgenstein . Blackmon was shocked . " You had such a handle on the material , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what secondary sources I thought you 'd been reading . " <p> " None , " I said . <p> He pressed me for more , but I kept my mouth shut . <p> I would never understand why I had bought Camus and Sartre that summer when my family had plenty to eat . I would never understand why the Russians sent the dog Laika into space to starve in death , or why I even thought about any of this , so minor in the context of crimes .
