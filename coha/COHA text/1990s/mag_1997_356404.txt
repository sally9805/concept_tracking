Recurring in time across China 's history has been the story of the rise and decline of successive dynasties . Since the 1900s , Chinese historians have strenuously attacked this traditional way of looking at history as violating any claims in China to development and progress . They feel that such an idea lies behind the concept of " an unchanging China , " which has been so damaging to foreign assessments of China 's development . Such historians have looked for the deeper rhythms of economic growth and change , territorial expansion , developments in the arts , and environmental factors as examples of what we should be studying instead . Nonetheless dynasties have risen and fallen across well over three millenniums , and it is not completely absurd to depict the People 's Republic as the latest manifestation of this historical phenomenon . <P> For the historian , therefore , Deng 's death raises a different but also absorbing set of echoes and parallels to the past . The 15 years between 1978 , when Deng returned to power after two major purges that failed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1993 , when his health obviously began to fail , have left him an ineradicable role in future accounts of China . These parallels seem to fit fairly neatly into two molds . One , familiar from several earlier dynasties , is the role of the man who has the delicate task of consolidating the work of an ambitious , tough , erratic though canny , and self-aggrandizing reunifier of China . Mao Zedong , like a select number of earlier Emperors , played the unifier 's role in drawing China together again in 1949 after a half-century of nightmarish domestic turbulence , civil war and foreign invasion . It fell to Deng Xiaoping , again like certain historical precursors , to take this mixed legacy and secure the positive aspects of the reunification in both its territorial and its economic dimensions . Deng , like these predecessors , could be completely ruthless in pursuit of these goals . He could also be vindictive and two-faced . But like them , he made China more prosperous , made restitution to a significant number of the victims from the founding phase , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talent from those who had not been in the original band of the " faithful , " and released the harshest of the constraints that had been imposed on writers and artists .
