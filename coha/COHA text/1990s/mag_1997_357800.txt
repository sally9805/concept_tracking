Hankering for a hot page-turner in the new year ? Check out Escape to Hell , a tour de force without remorse , penned originally in Arabic by Libyan strongman and litterateur MUAMMAR GADDAFI . The volume 's 20-page preface , by PIERRE SALINGER , the former J.F.K. press secretary and international oddball , presents Gaddafi as a multifaceted Arab and Islamic figure too long typecast as a one-dimensional thug in the West . The book delivers an eclectic mix of Gaddafi essays and short stories . You can curl up with The Suicide of the Astronaut , the dictator 's winsome tale of a space traveler who explores the moon only to find upon his return to earth that his life is empty . Salinger and Canadian publisher ALAIN STANKE clinched the book deal with Gaddafi not long ago in a tent at the maximum leader 's army barracks near Tripoli . Stanke says Gaddafi will get no advance and denies reports that the Libyan government is paying the publisher and Salinger to put out the book . No movie options yet . <P>  --  By Adam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
