BILL CLINTON IS IN A TICKLISH SPOT . He needs the Federal Reserve Board to help ward off the threat of a recession that could gravely wound or even kill his re-election bid . But he dare not put any overt pressure on the fiercely independent Fed , or on its Republican-appointed chairman , Alan Greenspan . And though the President has been pointedly silent about whether he will reappoint Greenspan when his term expires March 1 , few people in Washington think he would risk dumping him . There would be too much hell to pay in Congress , on Wall Street and in the business community , where Greenspan is an inflation-conquering hero . <P> Greenspan , however , has motives beyond his own job security for at least partly accommodating White House wishes . The Fed chairman would badly tarnish his reputation as a prudent monetary watchdog if he allowed a recession to develop by keeping interest rates too high for too long . And he can now claim victory in the fight against inflation that he had long rated more important than promoting economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which consumer prices rose by less than 3% , a period of stability unmatched in three decades . <P> So Greenspan last week made a pump-priming move : he led the board in reducing two key interest rates , the federal funds rate and the discount rate , by a quarter-point each . That prompted major banks to lower the prime lending rates granted to their best customers by the same amount , to 8 1/4% . The discreet adjustment , his third since July , also drew an ever so discreet statement from the Administration praising the cut while stressing respect for the Fed 's independence . <P> So political punctilio was preserved , but what will happen to American jobs and incomes ? The latest figures show that the economy was slowing dramatically as 1995 wore to a close . Christmas sales were even more dismal than first thought ; December retail totals rose a mere 0.3% above November 's . Year-end inventories of unsold cars were high enough to cause General Motors , Ford and Chrysler to cut some assemblies in January . Consumer confidence , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell to a two-year low . <P> Edward Yardeni , a prominent New York City investment economist , thinks there is a 60% to 70% chance that the U.S. is already in a recession . ( A rule-of-thumb definition of recession is a decline in national output that lasts at least two consecutive quarters . ) Very few of his colleagues agree , but many of them believe that right now output is growing at an annual rate of only 1% or so . The National Association of Purchasing Management is more pessimistic . Enough of its members reported their companies ' manufacturing output declining in January to suggest that the economy as a whole shrank last month . <P> Even a 1% growth rate would be insufficient over the long run to prevent an increase in unemployment . Sure enough , the jobless rate in January rose to 5.8% from 5.6% in December , returning to the top end of the range it held throughout 1995 . More ominously , total payroll employment dropped by 201,000 jobs , the biggest decline in nearly five years . The Labor Department put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but some economists suspect that even with normal weather employment would have been flat .
