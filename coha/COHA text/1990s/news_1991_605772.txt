<p> The play : 60 Counter Gap . The players : H-back Terry Orr , left tackle Jim Lachey , left guard Raleigh McKenzie , center Jeff Bostic , right guard Mark Schlereth , right tackle Joe Jacoby , tight end Don Warren , running back Earnest Byner or Ricky Ervins . <p> The possibilities : Anything from a two-yard loss to a touchdown  --  to a career-ending injury . <p> This is the Redskins ' signature play , the one that caused a good deal of football to realize  --  in the early 1980s  --  that Joe Gibbs and his assistant thinkers were doing breakthrough work on offense . <p> This play also is one of the ways high-level football separates itself from every other sport , for it involves massive men pulling off an intricate maneuver in a confined space . <p> The subject of football players at risk has been particularly pertinent since Detroit offensive lineman Mike Utley 's paralyzing injury . McKenzie said 60 Counter Gap ( the 60 means the play goes to the right and outside the right tackle ) is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He and Bostic are the two players whose bodies are most at risk . <p> " It 's most dangerous for the pulling guard , " said Bostic . Pointing to a desk about five yards away , he added : " The guard has to run about that far , so his collision will be a little more intense . Russ Grimm used to take a lot of shots . " <p> McKenzie : " The outside linebacker kind of takes a toll on your neck and shoulders . " <p> Everything vital in 60 Counter Gap takes place in an area about as long as basketball 's free throw line . So much clutter ; so many body parts left so vulnerable . <p> " An avalanche of human beings , " said offensive line coach Jim Hanifan . And that 's only for half the play . <p> " We used to kill people with it , " said Bostic . " It took a while for defenses to adjust . And when they did adjust , we adjusted to that . It 's been a continual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Counter Gap made its debut Sept. 25 , 1983 , in Seattle  --  and that it worked right out of the box . More than eight years later , the coach smiles in silent satisfaction . All those hours planning and practicing so he could look across the field toward the Seahawks bench and sort of say to himself : " Sur-PRISE ! Gotcha . " <p> Also , Gibbs volunteers that , like so much else in football , 60 Counter Gap was borrowed from somebody else and refined . Misdirection plays are older than he is ; this one was almost a dead steal from the University of Nebraska playbook . <p> The idea with 60 Counter Gap is to create misdirection and mismatches . The play starts with the running back , usually Byner , taking a long jab step to his left as the ball is snapped . Ideally , at least one linebacker is supposed to make an early commitment that way . <p> " That step by the running back used to just freeze everybody , even the linemen , " said Jacoby , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the pulling guard . <p> While Byner is stepping to his left , the left guard ( McKenzie ) and left tackle ( Lachey ) are pulling to their right . After Bostic snaps the ball , he and everybody to his right  --  Schlereth , Jacoby and Warren  --  start what Hanifan called " an avalanche of human beings . " <p> That avalanche involves moving defenders  --  domino style  --  away from the direction McKenzie and Lachey are going . If the defensive formation has three linemen and four linebackers , Warren and Jacoby will double-team the left end , Schlereth will block the nose guard and Bostic will head for the right end . <p> What 's ahead ? <p> A linebacker  --  and McKenzie not so politely bumps him toward the sideline . If everyone else has done his job , Lachey heads for the first opening he sees and makes it larger . His man might be a linebacker coming from the middle or a safety crashing from the outside . <p> " What you have  --  ideally  --  is a 280-pound guard on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a 210-pound safety , " said Hanifan . " Big mismatches . " While these opposite-direction collisions are going on , Mark Rypien hands the ball to the running back , who reads Lachey 's block and reacts . <p> " Most of the time you 're looking for three or four yards , " said Byner . Assistant coach Don Breaux " always says it 's either feast or famine . If you can break it outside , 10-20 yards is a good possibility . The 20-yarder I broke for a touchdown against Cleveland was one I broke to the outside . " <p> " Joe Washington used to grab my pants when I was the pulling tackle , " Jacoby said . " He knew nobody could get around me . I used to sort of propel him to the outside a few times . " <p> One of the potential problems is that the right linebacker  --  unblocked  --  could follow Lachey and grab Byner just as the handoff takes place . Deployed in motion , H-back Orr turns and eliminates that worry . <p> " For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so good that we got everybody on defense on the line of scrimmage " trying to close every possible gap . " Even the two safeties would attack . That 's how realistic it was . " <p> Anyone with a low-level football IQ could figure what to do next . If the defense is sending everybody toward the line of scrimmage to stop 60 Counter Gap , the quarterback simply fakes a handoff and passes . <p> " First time we ran the pass option that day against Seattle , " Gibbs said , " it went for a touchdown . The wide receiver ran wide open . " <p> When the avalanche of human beings caused by the right side of the offensive line develops , it heads toward Bostic . He said : " I 've had a couple times when the right guard has taken the nose and thrown him on my leg . But I 'll take my position to the pulling guard . " <p> For Bostic , the goal is to stay low and get moving left  --  away from the avalanche  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1,500 pounds will be coming down toward your back . If that do n't get you off your duff , nothing will . " <p> McKenzie has not been badly hurt on 60 Counter Gap . Jacoby 's serious knee injury came blocking for a field goal ; Bostic 's serious knee injury , on pass protection . <p> " Not that I remember any of it , " said Bostic . " Not that it was in St. Louis . Or there were 14 seconds to go in the third quarter . Or that the play was called 50 Sucker . Or that it was run from about the 30-yard line . We were going toward the scoreboard , near as I can recollect . " <p> Never does McKenzie consider the danger when Rypien calls the play  --  " You do n't think about that unless you see somebody actually get hurt . Or you watch it on film and see somebody get hurt on it . " <p> Defenses started adjusting to 60 Counter Gap  --  and when pulling tackle Jacoby could not create a hole , fullback @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Riggins would run up your back " if the hole suddenly collapsed and his escort was on the ground , Jacoby said . " He 'd put his cleats right between your numbers . Then he 'd yell : ' Bull's-eye ! ' " <p> Technique is vital . For instance : If the right guard 's footwork leaves him with too narrow a stance or his legs crossed , a Reggie White can bop him backward into the path of his pulling pals . That wreck leaves the runner helpless . Precise footwork , McKenzie said , also helps avoid injury . When he was the Redskins ' offensive line coach , Joe Bugel used to threaten a $ 500 fine for not wearing a knee brace . <p> " That was $ 500 per brace , " Jacoby said . " It got your attention real quick . " <p> Bostic was not wearing a brace when he hurt his knee . <p> The list of variations off 60 Counter Gap is numerous . One has Lachey staying put and the motion-man H-back drifting behind the pulling guard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , behind Warren  --  and drive toward either the outside linebacker or a safety . <p> And who picks up the defender the H-back normally would have in that situation ? McKenzie rolls his eyes and says : " We might ask one of our talented receivers to do it . " <p> Byner runs 60 Counter Gap well , said Jacoby , who adds : " The young kid Ervins hits it really well . " Jacoby was " the young kid " when 60 Counter Gap first surfaced  --  which speaks well both of the play and one of its principal players . <p> " The play-action passes off the play can be devastating , " said Hanifan . He said old tackle Jacoby last season was startled by how much activity the guard faces  --  and so quickly and , on the sideline once , asked : " What should I do ? " <p> Replied the wise old coach , who knows that plays do n't always go as practiced : " Hit the first thing you see and keep going . "
