Prologue Geoffrey Shafer , dashingly outfitted in a single-breasted blue blazer , white shirt , striped tie , and narrow gray trousers from H. Huntsman &; Sons , walked out of his town house at seven-thirty in the morning and climbed into a black Jaguar XJ12 . He backed the Jag slowly out of the driveway , then stepped on the accelerator . The sleek sports car rocketed up to fifty before it reached the stop sign at Connecticut Avenue , in the posh Kalorama section of Washington , D.C. When Shafer reached the busy intersection , he did n't stop . He floored the accelerator , picking up more speed . He was doing sixty-five and ached to crash the Jag into the stately fieldstone wall bordering the avenue . He aimed the Jag closer to the wall . He could see the head-on collision , visualize it , feel it all over . At the last possible second , he tried to avoid the deadly crash . He spun the wheel hard to the left . The sports car fish-tailed all the way across the avenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick in the air . The Jag skidded to a stop , headed the wrong way on the street , the windshield issuing its glossy black stare at a barrage of early oncoming traffic . Shafer stepped on the accelerator again and headed forward against the oncoming traffic . Every car and truck began to honk loud , sustained blasts . Shafer did n't even try to catch his breath or bearings . He sped along the avenue , gaining speed . He zoomed across Rock Creek Bridge and made a left , then another left onto Rock Creek Parkway . A tiny scream of pain escaped from his lips . It was involuntary , coming swiftly and unexpectedly . A moment of fear , weakness . He floored the gas pedal again , and the engine roared . He was doing seventy , then pressing to eighty . He zigged and zagged around slower-moving sedans , sport-utility vehicles , a soot-covered A &P; delivery truck . Only a few honked now . Other drivers on the parkway were terrified , scared out of their minds . He exited the Rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gunned it again . P Street was even more crowded at that hour than the parkway had been . Washington was just waking up and setting off to work . He could still see that inviting stone wall on Connecticut . He should n't have stopped . He began searching for another rock-solid object , looking for something to hit very hard . He was doing eighty miles an hour as he approached Dupont Circle . He shot forward like a ground rocket . Two lines of traffic were backed up at a red light . No way out of this one , he thought . Nowhere to go left or right . He did n't want to rear-end a dozen cars ! That was no way to end thisend his lifeby smashing into a commonplace Chevy Caprice , a Honda Accord , a delivery truck . He swerved violently to the left and veered into the lanes of traffic coming east , coming right at him . He could see the panicked , disbelieving faces behind the dusty , grime-smeared windshields . The horns started to blast , a high-pitched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just barely squeezed between an oncoming Jeep and a concrete-mixer truck . He sped down M Street , then onto Pennsylvania Avenue , and headed toward Washington Circle . The George Washington University Medical Center was up aheada perfect ending . The Metro patrol car appeared out of nowhere , its siren-bullhorn screaming in protest , its rotating beacon glittering , signaling for him to pull over . Shafer slowed down and pulled to the curb.The cop hurried to Shafer 's car , his hand on his holster . He looked frightened and unsure . " Get out of the car , sir , " the cop said in a commanding voice . " Get out of the car right now . " Shafer suddenly felt calm and relaxed . There was no tension left in his body . " All right . All right . I 'm getting out . No problem . " " You know how fast you were going ? " the cop asked in an agitated voice , his face flushed a bright red . Shafer noticed that the cop 's hand was still on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer . " Well , I 'd say about thirty , Officer , " he finally said . " Maybe a little over the speed limit . " Then he took out an I.D . card and handed it over . " But you ca n't do anything about it . I 'm with the British Embassy . I have diplomatic immunity . " That night , as he was driving home from work , Geoffrey Shafer started to feel that he was losing control again . He was beginning to frighten himself . His whole life had begun to revolve around a fantasy game he played called the Four Horsemen . In the game , he was the player called Death . The game was everything to him , the only part of his life with real meaning . He sped across town from the British Embassy , all the way to the Petworth district of Northwest . He knew he should n't be there , a white man in a spiffy Jaguar . He could n't help himself , though , any more than he could that morning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Shafer took out his laptop and typed a message to the other players , the Horsemen . FRIENDS , DEATH IS ON THE LOOSE IN WASHINGTON . THE GAME IS ON . He started the Jag again and rode a few more blocks to Petworth . The usual outrageously provocative hookers were already parading up and down Varnum and Webster streets . A song called " Nice and Slow " was playing from a vibrating blue BMW . Ronnie McCall 's sweet voice blended into the early evening . The girls waved to him and showed their large , flat , pert , or flabby breasts . Several wore colorful bustiers with matching hot pants and shiny silver or red platform shoes with pointy heels . He slowed to a stop beside a small black girl who looked to be around sixteen and had an unusually pretty face . Her legs were long and slender for such a petite body . She wore too much makeup for his taste . Still , she was hard to resist , so why should he ? " Nice car . Jaguar . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled and made a sexy little " O " with her lipsticked mouth . " You 're cute , too , mistah . " He smiled back at her . " Jump in , then . Let 's go for a test ride . See if it 's true love or just infatuation . " He glanced around the street quickly . None of the other girls were working this corner . " A hundred for full-service , sweetie ? " she asked as she wiggled her tight little butt inside the Jag . Her perfume smelled like eau de bubble gum , and she seemed to have bathed in it . " As I said , get into the car . A hundred dollars is petty cash for me . " He knew he should n't be picking her up in the Jaguar , but he took her for a joy ride anyway . He could n't help himself now . He brought the girl to a small , wooded park in a part of Washington called Shaw . He parked in a thicket of fir trees that hid the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she was even smaller and younger than he had thought . " How old are you ? " he asked . " How old you want me to be ? " she said , and smiled . " Sweetie , I need the money first . You know how it works . " " Yes . But do you ? " he asked . He reached into his pocket and pulled out a switchblade knife . He had it at her throat in an instant . " Do n't hurt me , " she whispered . " Just be cool . " " Get out of the car . Slowly . Do n't you dare scream . You be cool . " Shafer got out with her , staying close , the knife still pressed to the hollow of her throat . " It 's all just a game , darling , " he explained . " My name is Death . You 're a very lucky girl . I 'm the best player of all . " As if to prove it , he stabbed her for the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
